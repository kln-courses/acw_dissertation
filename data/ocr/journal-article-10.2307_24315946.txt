After the strange and bedazzled passage through this country of the surrealist comets Breton and Artaud, there followed a meteor shower of personages who were even more productive, putting down roots in the dis concerting soil of a nation that did not think of itself with much disconcertment. Surrealism taught Mexico to astonish itself in a very different way: passionate without nationalist motives or patriotism, dangerous without heroism, creative without aggrandizing mirrors. Transpatriated surrealism not only reiterated the rituals of as tonishment that bring us happiness as admirers of art but also created new environments for ourselves: surrealism put un predictable but already indispensable spaces on the map of Mexico. Monumental appendices that communicated a natural world overflowing with dreams, as Edward James well knew, and as we have learned to appreciate in Xilitla. The surrealist geography was disturbed when it reached Mexico: it boiled up, creating unique soils and subsoils. Leonora Carrington, Wolfgang Paalen. Luis Buñuel and Remedios Varo are just a few of these artists who are as Mexican as Octavio Paz. and at the same time, are equally cosmopolitan. They are bridges between Mexico and the world, underground bridges, igneous—in other words, vol canic. If, as Octavio Paz once stated, surrealism is more of a sensibili ty than an aesthetic movement, in Mexico that sensibility ignites the fire of laughter, of profound and limitless eroticism, of inquiry into the mythic past of the polished rocks that surround us and of the unknown men who made them and who. through a surre alist act of faith, we call our ancestors. The surrealists are our ancestors in the same mythic and disconcerting sense: we believe in their vision because it speaks to us and awak ens US to Our dreams* Translated by Michelle Suderman* This and This and This Octavio Paz Surrealism has been the apple of fire on the tree of syntax* Surrealism has been the camellia of ash between the breasts of the girl possessed by the ghost of Orestes* Surrealism has been the dish of lentils that the glance of the prodigal son transforms into the smoking feast of the cannibal king* Surrealism has been the balm for Fierabras that erases the signs of original sin in the navel of language* Surrealism has been the spit on the host and the carnation of dynamite in the confessional and the open sesame to the bank vaults and the iron bars of asylums* Surrealism has been the drunken flame that guides the steps of the sleepwalker who tiptoes along the edge of the shadow that the blade of the guillotine casts on the neck of the condemned* Surrealism has been the burning nail in the geometer's forehead and the gust of wind at midnight that lifts the sheets from virgins* Surrealism has been the savage bread that cramps the belly of the Society of Jesus until it must vomit all the cats and devils it has inside* Surrealism has been the fistful of salt that eats away the slugs of social realism* Surrealism has been the cardboard crown on the head less critic and the viper that slips between the legs of the critic's wife* Surrealism has been the leprosy of the Christian West and the whip of nine cords that sketches the way out toward other lands other languages and other souls across the backs of brutish and brutalizing nationalism* Surrealism has been the speech of the child buried in every man and the sprinkling of syllables of milk on the charred bones of Giordano Bruno* Surrealism has been the seven-league boots of those who escaped from the prisons of dialectical reason and Tom Thumb's hatchet that chops through the knots of the poisonous vines that cover the walls of the petrified revolutions of the Twentieth Century* Surrealism has been this and this and this* Translated by Eliot Weinberger+ From Collected Poems 1957-1987. copyright © 1986 by Octavio Paz and Eliot Weinberger.

But the capital of the ancient Roman Empire would not be a permanent place of residence for the young man who by this time saw in himself the first signs of a consum mate artist. In 1919 he was studying in Tiboli, and later in Berlin. Like many other authors, Paalen was fascinated by the work and letters of Van Gogh, although his encounter with that vision of man and of painting had something slightly or radically different about it: a sign, a sense of waiting. In 1925 Wolfgang Paalen took a liking to Kokoschka's work, and to one of his paintings in particular: The Emigrants. Paalen kept his eyes on this artist for a long time. Later he traveled from Berlin to Paris, and in 1926 he returned to Munich, where he became interested in the art of Oceania—that is to say, in the Other, in for eignness, which would begin to infiltrate his visual-theoretic cor pus. In 1933 he traveled to Spain to visit the Altamira Caves, where once more, the Other became part of the self. Or did it?* But what was this man looking for in the Altamira drawings other than a visu al investigation? He was clearly seeking to give a different spin to the wanderlust that had marked and would continue to mark his life (and his production), starting with his early experiences with his family. His father, Gustav Robert Paalen, was born in Moravia, a prov ince of Bohemia, during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Paalen's research into the past and the present of—I repeat—the Other, and into the paleography of early humans, responded to an impulse that had its origins at a much deeper level than his traveler's back ground, further back in his mental logbook, to something that by working away at it, reveals an enigma. Another twist—besides the historically diffused Austrian borders I have already mentioned— which provides us with another clue was the religious conversion of his father* In his complex system of objective and aesthetic coordinates, which also combined the artistic and scientific proto col, this painter was reestablishing a reflexive process that pointed toward the classical division between reality and fiction, art and life. Paalen explored totemic cultures looking for links that had exist ed since remote times: he looked for an Other wiser concept of the world, understood in terms of known geographical divisions and in harmony with the legacy of the Enlightenment. His search was car ried out in the very place where that world did not fit because the universe—in the eyes of prehistoric humans and of those who have claimed a cyclical conception of life at the very zenith of Western civilization—gazed expansively, navigating between Heav en and Earth, between inner and outer perception (and conjecture)» The year 1939 was an important time in Paalen's life: he came to Mexico accompanied by Eva Sulzer and Alice Rahon. The poet painter, in permanent transit, chose Mexico as a place of refuge. I write place, and the word "place" stands out for an instant on my screen as abstract. "The rails with their sleepers become too ab stract"—Paalen. I wrote, "in transit"—transit dilutes its borders and becomes the center: fleeting or lasting, continuous from and within the momentary.

Paalen is not an exile, he said; he is honest from within his own phase shift, from within his consubstantial displacement» "I think meaning is to reach a potential concept of reality, which in Greek I call tó dinatorr. the pos sible. A philosophy of the possible would comprehend art as a rhythmic equation of the world, an indispensable complement of the logical equations of the natural sciences. Only from the interaction of the two does the possibility of a new ethic arise, which is thus provided with capacity to end metaphysics," writes Paalen in the last issue of the magazine Dyn, which he published in Mexico from 1941 to 1943» This shows how comprehensive his thinking was, colored with hybrid tones in several aspects. In his essay "During the Eclipse," he wrote these lines: "Art images are not purely an empty reflection or an empty blueprint, but a blueprint of man himself."» What is eclipsed and gathers light; melancholy exposed light, horrible weed-like flower, sinuously vegetable and bony, with a ravine and a gray sky sus pended precariously on the edge of nothing, and a pile of debris below, on the burned earth, buried deep in fiendish memory? It is Paysage Totemique de rnon Enfance II, 1937. And the vacuum, the loss, where blue is the passage or nocturnal place buried in the last layers of the conscience, and in the origin» Aside from this, to say that Wolfgang Paalen was a surrealist would be too limiting. Yes, he was. He could be called a consummate surrealist. He tapped into the core of the movement like an incisive bird passing through. Breton wrote about him; Duchamp would remember him well; Nuage Articulée is a reference to the umbrellas that Duchamp once hung from the roof. But Paalen was also an eccentric surrealist, with the controversial loyalty that marked those peerless men, a loyalty that failed to escape even from its counterpart: betrayal» "If the elixir no longer has the power to make one grow or shrink so much as to disappear, it is not enough to expose the word tomorrow to the light to see that it still remains inside and that it has also become transparent," the great transpatriate wrote one day in Canada. Paalen committed suicide in Taxco in September 1959. In other latitudes, September heralds the spring. Wolfgang Paalen opened and shut every season—of art and of life—and he stayed in Mexico» Translated by Carole Castelli» Stone Utopia The New World's Most Ancient Face Wolfgang Paalen Not long ago, the most ancient face of the New World was discovered in the lowlands of southern Mexico, an area which had been reclaimed by the jungle long before the Aztecs founded their grandiose capital. In clearings deep within the virgin rainforest, lost in mangrove-edged swamps, the gigantic helmets of several colossal heads carved out of massive blocks of basalt break through the earth, or they rest with their faces turned toward the Sun. Curiously enough, all these monumental heads are crowned with bizarre semispherical "hel mets." Indigenous farmers living in the region took one of them for an enormous overturned pot after beholding the top part of the head rising above the ground. Disappointed when they didn't find Opposite page: Kati Horna. Edward James, n/d. ©All rights reserved. Page 65, top left, bottom right: Alice Rahon. Prehistoric Animals.

Lelia Driben Carole Castelli» Wolfgang Paalen</page><page sequence="4">68 the great treasure they had hoped to en counter under the enormous rock, they gave up their excavation when the "pot" turned out to be the crown of a colossal stone head. This took place 100 years ago, when a section of the rainforest was being turned into arable land, near the Hueyapan hacienda in the state of Veracruz. However, the historical importance of this discovery was only properly appreciated several years later. [...]* We know nothing of the artisans who sculpted these gigantic heads, and almost nothing of the people whose cul ture is responsible for these and other monumental yet exquisitely subtle works. Nonetheless, it was this same mysterious people -who built the largest pyramids in the Americas in Teotihuacan and Choluia, who created many works of art of a qual ity that is unequalled in-the history of pre Hispanic stone carving. The puzzling origins of the race known as "Olmec"—harking back to an extremely ancient "mother cul ture" of which most Mesoamerican cultures are offshoots—has become Mexican ar chaeology's most fascinating enigma»The last traces of these master sculptors had vanished from memory by the time the first Spanish frigates crossed the Atlantic, their course taking them to the shores of Veracruz. Their name was already legend by then. A term derived from olli, meaning rubber, designated the native inhabitants of Qlman—the tropical country where this product existed in raw form. This term ap pears in ancient chronicles which tell of Indian traditions and legends. Thus, in the six teenth century, the Indian prince Ixtlixóchitl wrote, "Those who ruled the world in the 'third era' were the Olmecs and Xicallancas" [...]* Although there is an ongoing debate as to whether certain dates have been cor rectly deciphered, stylistic evidence as well as more recent methods of scientific inquiry point to the ambiguity of Olmec culture. Chronologies established by radioactive carbon dating clearly indicate that Olmec culture is indeed so ancient that it undoubtedly precedes the birth of other Mesoamerican civilizations. Its archaic peri od having been situated during the first millenium bc, Olmec stone carving reveals itself to be contemporaneous with ancient China. In other words, this form of pre Hispanic art is much older than had previ ously been suspected. [-...]* The fact that a great number of native American races have been found to have Mongoloid features is only one of several extraordinary parallels between this continent and Asia, and these points of similarity are particularly important in the case of Mexico* "The magical powers of the heav ens and the Earth always unite to render perfect results. Thus the pure essences of the hills and waters solidify into precious jade." The implications of this quote from T'ang Yung Tao's treatise on jade would have been fully appreciated in pre-Conquest Mexico where jade (or jadeite) is the sacred stone par excellence. Its name was synonymous with every thing that was precious and divine. Like the ancient Chinese who placed jade cicadas in the mouths of the dead, Mexicans used jade pearls for the same purpose. Moreover, both the Chinese and Mexicans painted jade objects for funerary use with red cinnabar* La Venta in the Olmec region is the site where Stirling discovered the greatest jade treasures ever unearthed in the Americas. The Aztecs called this part of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico "the Jade coast." [...]*It was also under Stirling's leadership that five colossal heads were unearthed in 1946—one of them the biggest and most beautiful discovered to this day. They were found in the area between San Lorenzo and Tenochtitlan. [...]* It is only when actually in their pres ence that one can appreciate the extraordinary effort that the transportation of these enor mous blocks of stone—each one weighing several tons—with simple stone tools must have entailed. They can only have originated from the Tuxtla basalt quarries, over 120 kilometers from the place where they were found. No one can say how many archaeological sites still remain hidden in the forest. The ruins of an abandoned aqueduct attest to the existence of an important settlement in remote times. We must wait and see what is revealed by certain mounds which today are barely identifiable under a canopy of wild banana trees and vines bearing gigantic yellow and purple flowers that, to the touch, seem modeled out of wax» The largest head discovered so far finally appeared on the steep slope of a canyon. Indians have named it "the King." Carved from a bluish-gray basalt block close to three meters tall (its mouth is almost one meter wide), this monolith must weigh more than fifteen tons. It lies in a state of majestic dereliction at the mercy of the elements, its enormous open eyes reflecting ancient cosmic wisdom. Its face, one of the most imposing ever conceived by an artist, is the most dignified among its princely brethren and bears a somber expression. Young and powerful, it has a sensitive, finely outlined mouth over a firm round chin. And the most disturbing of the many questions that the enigma behind these works still poses is: why were these gigantic personages conceived solely as heads? It is indeed clear that they are perfect ly complete heads, neither masks nor fragments of broken sculptures nor sections of buried busts, as in the case of the great Easter Island heads* Lacking other hypotheses, I find it plau sible to venture a tentative interpretation which, based on another puzzle, might help dispel a bit of the mystery surrounding the great Olmec heads*Judging from certain examples of statuary, Olmec worship manifestly centered on the figure of the child. As far as the jaguar is concerned, it is not surprising that, in the tribes' mythological imagination, this animal came to represent the indisputable power of wildlife. Moreover, it would only be a small stretch to assert that the Olmec race's physiological features bear a certain feline quality. Ancient sculptures as well as present-day indigenous people of ancestral lineage have an almost cat like agility, a rounded musculature, suggesting the harmonious power of a ball rolling. Representations of acrobats bear witness to their ancestral culture's well known predilection for exercises focusing on agility, and it is more than likely that the American game of pelota was invented in the "land of rubber."* Regarding facial features, it is above all the mouth—with its well defined down-turning corners and the upper lip's sharp curve, making the incisors clearly visible—that has lent itself to anthropomorphic stylization in the image of the jaguar. It is in fact surprising that the Olmecs did not associate the jaguar's features—-the most fero cious animal, their most dangerous enemy-—with the most powerful divinities, the gods of war, but rather decided to wed them to those of a defenseless newborn, resulting in a unique personage which has been christened the "baby-jaguar."* Before I try to interpret this pecu liar symbolism, I should first refer to the universality of certain mythological archetypes* The fact that people have tied their fears and desires to certain forces of nature does not con tradict the fact that, once they had learned to draw sustenance from the land, they acknowl edged the Earth as the elemental mother who successively nourishes and devours her chil dren. Hence the ambivalent features—both benevolent and terrifying—seen on divinities</page><page sequence="5">Jorge Vertiz. Stegosaurus Column. Xilitla, San Luis Potosí. 1982-1983. that personify Mother Earth. However, we should note that these divinities' images vary widely depending on the era and on local conditions» Besides jaguars of the sky and the rain, the Olmecs imagined an Earth-jaguar. Since this is a nocturnal animal, it is believed to rule over darkness and to possess the power of caus ing eclipses, swallowing up the Sun. Moreover, as a creature living under the cloak of night, it brings to mind the shadows of caves and the darkness of the abyss»One of La Ventas most outstanding monuments, known to archaeologists as Altar no. 1, is composed of a rectangular slab of solid stone, its upper surface covered with a bas-relief representing a jaguar's hide. From a deep niche carved under the animal's head emerges the life-size figure of a man whose headdress bears another jaguar's face. Another monolith at the same site has been named the "Altar of the Quintuplets" (or Altar no. 2) due to four figures of children sculpted on its sides; the figure of a man carrying a newborn in his arms also emerges from a cavity in the front. Though the upper part of this altar has been destroyed, it is also associated with the jaguar cult due both to the mask adorn ing the main figure's priestly headdress and to the central vault» If the Earth is symbolized among these people by a jaguar's open muzzle, the significance of the niches in these altars is quite clear, especially in the case of Altar no. 2, in which the central vault bears a definite likeness to a very stylized jaguar mouth» Unlike certain reli gions associated with death-worship, the Olmec faith is manifest ly centered on the mysteries of birth. The fact that genitalia and other sexual attributes are hardly ever represented in their art and the importance given to the figure of the child indicate a strong matriarchal tendency. I would like to mention as an example—for those who find the comparative analysis of the symbology of very distant cultures to be overly arbitrary—that the Aztecs named gold the "excrement of the gods," in perfect analogy to the European symbolism referring to this precious metal» If we consider that in the scene represented on Altar no. 2, the man (probably the high priest) must have entered the great cave-muzzle and subsequent ly reemerged from it with the newborn in his arms, it becomes clear that the Olmec jaguar symbolizes not only Mother Earth in general but also the female organ of procreation specifically. This is why the child-god, born of the Earth-jaguar, adopts the features of a baby jaguar» Unlike the aforementioned altars, the colossal heads are associated with the jaguar not because of their features, which are entirely human, but because of their location in sanctuaries or the emblematic signs on their helmets. It seems to me that this leads to the following interpretation: these monumental heads refer to a great cult of birth since they are representations of entities of superhuman size that could not have issued from anything but a mother—the Earth—of at least equal size in physical terms» In the same way that children are born head first, these effigies are sim ply a head coming out of the earth itself, out of Mother Earth» Mexican mythology describes a fundamental, legendary struggle between two clans in which the Jaguar People succumb to the sudden attack of the Snake People. The myths of conquerors from the North identify the ancient jaguar as the "smoking mirror," the sinister Tezcatlipoca, from the time when Quetzalcóatl—the holy snake—managed to consolidate his rule. One of the many vari ants of the complex personification of the plumed serpent is probably rooted in the tradition which situates the Olmecs'-point of origin in Temoachán, "place of the bird-snake." Though among the Olmecs he is a lesser god compared to the "jaguar-mother," -the "bird-snake" becomes, in Mayan myth, the "plumed serpent" whose name is later associated with the heroic demigod who is responsible for the advent of civilization» The appearance of mythical heroes who are the inventors of the arts and sciences, under the sign of the phallic snake, demonstrates the ascendancy of male concepts. It is not only in Mexican mythology that the snake monopolizes the tree of knowledge» The traditions of the epic struggle between the jaguar and the snake thus do not only reflect the actual battles of warriors but also the conflict between matriarchal tendencies in the South and the rise of patriarchy in the North—a conflict of universal significance in the birth and death of civilizations» Translated by Richard Moszka» First published in Cahiers d'Art (Paris. December J952J» Alice Paalen César Moro Blue-red; green-gray, blue-gold, and all the colors alternating at disymbolic speeds. The slowness of mother-of-pearl through smoke striped with yellow in ascending acceleration. The instant landscapes of the cervical cortex. The fire plant burning in emerald-green water.

The winged ankle of Mercury in his metamorphosis as a fly trapped by carnivorous vines flowing later like an enervating liquor ramified through a thousand thousand shifting polyhedrons upon a carpet of algae» Over and over, the painting poses its problem, resolved here with the agility of the prov erbial fairy's fingers. Once the phosphorescent trip has begun, the walls spin around, showing us their previously invisible side: their hair dripping with lunar nectar, the porphyry lost in their modest entrails. The poignant interlacing initials in the form of a heart, and a crack, the unforgettable mark left by quakes that go back to the early days when the world smiled at us with the announcement of catastro phe» Alice Paalen's painting has grown naturally, like a flower: her in ner process may have been as painful as the opening of a flower or a chrysalis must be. But the whole process happens in inner darkness. The visible fruits glow with nuances, with lines, with fleshy and vel vety surfaces. Color raises and lowers its voice to tell us of the in describable: the voice of color.

We must emphasize the fact that the wonderful adventure of the creation of that essentially primitive, magical and childlike world of painting is accomplished without any obvious scares or starts, as clear as the adventure tale of an expedition through fertile and abun dant lands, from which the traveler returns, arms laden with rare fruits, unknown species, the feathers and furs of fabulous creatures by force of great physical beauty* The sea air releases its aromas, even the murmur of shells and stones under a pearly sky with intimate light. The fickleness of fortune is set aside in the patient alchemy of starry fabrics opening happy windows on a lost world in the process of being rebuilt» Alice Paalen's magical authority is palpable throughout her work. Without hesitation, she has gradually asserted herself, with the patience of a spider who. during the night hours, weaves its im ponderable veil that will intercept the rays of dawn, collecting dewdrops, bundles of mist, flying blades of grass like feathers from its fresh vegetative neighbor» Brimming with promise, her painting is already a perfectly tangible reality. Its excellent material, its fine color qualities in the service of a first-class poetic sensibility attest to the certainty of her brilliant future. Let others concern themselves with anecdotes or childish tales. Alice Paalen limits herself to producing admirable paintings at a time when so many worries that are truly irrelevant to the art form have succeeded in introducing the indisputable malaise afflicting painters during the crisis of revision we are currently experiencing, and from which many surprises and also many disappointments are sure to emerge» Translated by Michelle Suderman» first published in Letras de México 18 (June I. 1944)* Utopia of Curiosity Benjamin Péret in Mexico, or the Poet's Point of View Jean-Louis Bédouin A convulsive land among all others, as beautiful as its name, Mexico is doubtless—like all Meccas of civilization—a place where the forces of life and death strug gle against each other with the most tragic violence, feeding on one another» Hence, the agave dies by thrusting into the white-hot sky its chandelier-like efflorescence which draws its surging strength from the plant's death throes; its fermented sap—pulque—was once the bever age of the gods. Thus the Aztec pantheon's cruel, insatiable divinities guaranteed the survival of a universe constantly threatened by apocalypse in exchange for a heavy tribute of blood and sacrificial victims' hearts. Even modern-day Mexico, born of the 1910 Revolution, owes a Wide range of its specific features to its pre-colonial and colonial past—a melange of ultra-modernism and backwardness, of freedom and ethnic segregation, wealth and misery which Luis Buñuel denounced in his film The Young and the Damned* Poet, revolutionary militant, a soldier in the Spanish war, Benjamin Péret was a refugee in Mexico from 1942 to 1949 along with his wife—painter Remedios Varo—and many others Alice Rahon (Alice Paalert).

He was very much aware of its contradictions, very sensitive to the phenomena of historical hybridization which had produced it. While his wife devoted herself to creating a body of work that to day is one of the most original within Mexican painting, he threw himself—and the term is no hyperbole—with tremendous impa tience and curiosity into the study of myth, chronicles, rare sacred texts and art objects that attest to the diversity and wealth of pre-Columbian civilizations, and everything else that is today nour ished by their substance, like those tropical flowers who draw their vibrant colors from the dead wood of giant trees long ago struck down by lightning» The spectacle of the street, epic trips aboard buses "rattling like pots and pans thrown down a stone staircase," landscapes, whether desert-like or lush, taught him as much as any writing or object could about "the realities of this extraordinary country, barely imaginable for a Western European man," as he would later state in an interview. His approach is as intuitive as it is analytical, as experiential as it is academic, more likely to capture the spirit of things than merely notice their strangeness. Regarding pre-Columbian art, he himself notes that its strangeness is merely superficial and serves "as in dreams, only to mask a deeper feeling."* Péret was the first to translate into French the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel, a collection of Mayan prophecies and eso teric texts; he also authored an important Anthology of Myths, Legends and Popular Tales of America and upon his return to France, composed a long poem, "Air mexicain," which the great poet Octavio Paz described as "one of the most beautiful that American myths and landscapes have ever inspired." This text is a dizzying sum mary of Mexican history from its mythic origins to the present day, including Zapata's revolutionary epic, full of images that seem to have emerged directly from the collective unconscious, and, as far as I know, is without equal in the field of modern French poetry» We would have to quote long passages of the account of his trip to Chichén Itzá to give readers a clear notion of Péret's ability at evok ing the atmosphere of dead cities, of reviving them amidst their former natural environment, reawakening shadows and echoes. "Night of Chichén Itzá," he writes, "shivering from the rumblings of a storm lost on the other side of the horizon, while owls screech and great trees tremble, shaking off toad fruit! The silence that stared at you not long ago, following you step by step and encircling you, suddenly seems to be hatching a plot, preparing an ambush. [...] And thus begins the singular struggle between a suspicious silence and a stifling racket—a menacing silence with the noise of jaws clacking. A first scream explodes, then two, then three, and a huge wave breaks, irresistibly washing over the forest, drowning it and creating a kind of pocket of insults on the beach of silence; it then withdraws gradually, leaving behind it a dripping stream of imprecations."» However, Péret also knows how to make the great buildings' living stones speak—they are the pyramids' skeletal remains and, as giant fossils, allow us to decipher their symbolism. Thus the great pyramid of Chichén Itzá—the one Spaniards named the Castle—appears to him as "a giant ghost dominating the frozen horde of temples sur rendered back to the Sun which had given rise to them: the Warriors, the Jaguars, the Ball Court, the Colonnade, the Market... all covered with a heavy armor of silence." He adds, "This pyramid, devoted to the cult of Kukulkán, was evidently destined to recall in every one of its details the sacred serpent. The ninety-one steps of its staircase are so tall and narrow that one has to climb them diagonally in such a way that the imposing procession of priests and dignitaries in head dresses, slowly ascending the pyramid's steps [...] must have given the spectator at ground level the impression of a huge serpent un winding its plumed rings and then plunging into the temple crown ing the building. Another detail further emphasizes the hypothesis of the builders' intent: the blocks of the nine sloped platforms are arranged in such a way as to outline a kind of fret which from afar, sketches out the shape of a serpent hugging the pyramid with its rings."» However, from this pyramid which will never witness the re turn of the "great Itzás"—since "the Spaniards drove them from their last refuge and dispersed them 136 days before the advent of the Katun 8 Ahau: Mayan history's fatal Katun"—to the modest pyramid of fruits and chilies that an indigenous woman offers in her stall in the market, there is a tenuous but indestructible thread, if one is able to see it or, more importantly, feel it. This thread is none other than po etry, without which, says Péret, "no people in the world would know how to live since it is the natural way of thinking of all humanity." Itself determined by peoples' conditions of existence, varying according to climate, geography, topography, fauna and flora, this poetry gives rise to formative myths which lie at the origin of cultural development, while its expression in art (before acquiring the autonomy we know this to have) is a direct form of expression» Due both to personal taste and deductive reasoning, Péret was inclined to see in archaic pre-Columbian artistic manifestations the reflection of a sort of state of grace in which the Indian existed in close contact with na ture. Not a hypothetical "state of innocence" as Jean-Jacques Rous seau imagined it, but a degree of development where man, already master of himself and of primary techniques—namely, pottery—es tablishes in some way the bases of his imaginary, setting the magic of speech and of the creative gesture against the fatality of natural laws» This is doubtless why he was particularly impressed by the "grace, elegance and childlike purity" of those clay female statuettes dating from around 1500 bc, a large number of which come from the archaeological site of Tlatilco in the Valley of Mexico. Are these vo tive objects tied to a fertility cult? There is no evidence to confirm this. However, without a doubt these child-women—with hourglass figures, almond eyes, diadems encircling their foreheads or crowned with the most fantastic hairdos—far from being crude renditions, are truly accomplished expressions of an art whose formal "modernism" is but one more aspect that makes them appealing to our eyes. We could say the same of the rough, powerful ceramic figures from Nayarit that Diego Rivera admired: similar to tree trunks, their inter lacing boughs bear a likeness to the limbs of painted bodies, while their fruits appear to be human faces; another case in point is the red pottery of Colima with its extremely fine grain—great vases or urns in the shape of animals, some of them bearing a human face, as if to better emphasize the interdependence between our species and theirs»These archaic works of art present all the features of "folk" art, unlike those of subsequent eras whose complexity and stylistic and symbolic opulence attest to the high degree of culture that the Olmecs and Mayas (in the South), the Toltecs and Zapotees (in the central region) and the founders of Teotihuacan (in the North) had attained even before the beginning of our era.

It is nonetheless remarkable that a poet like Péret, rather than being seduced by the mystery, does his best to clear up the facts, crossing paths with scientists who, following the pioneers of Amer icanism, set themselves to the task of elucidating it^ His "Notes on Pre-Columbian Art" published in English in 1917 in the magazine Horizon are in this regard a precious contribution not so much in terms of what they tell us—indeed, an abundance of specialized lit erature has not left us completely in the dark—but rather because of the lines of research and reflection they suggest. Basing himself on the principle that art is originally the expression of primordial myths, Péret strives to show how, in evolved societies, these myths are transformed into religious dogma, all the more absolute since they lie at the very heart of life and limit the role of the artist in his urge to illustrate them. The powerful priestly castes and warrior or ders established laws and ruled over sedentary Mesoamerican farm ers who had no domesticated animals besides dogs, nor that pri mordial tool which is the wheel, basing their power on a mysticism of time whose periodical renewal depended on the strict observance of sacrificial rites. In response to the somber Chronos of the Greeks— son of Gaia, the Earth, who devoured his children—crossing from one shore of the human soul to the other, we find Huitzilopochtli, the Aztecs' terrifying tribal god who devoured the hearts of human victims, and his mother Coatlicue, "she of the skirt of serpents," another goddess of the Earth and death. "The most characteristic specimen of Aztec art,", writes Péret in this regard, "is surely the monument to Coatlicue, Huitzilopochtli's virgin mother, who in stantly communicates an atmosphere of terror. [...] The Aztecs trans formed horror into a virtue and into a material and moral instru ment of domination. Their sculpture's aim is visibly to inspire this terror which is nothing but the product of their own unconscious terror. In other words, the exteriorization of this horror in art is nothing but an attempt to dominate it.'«Aztec art is not unique in expressing this sacred terror, although its scope is without prece dent. We can already recognize it in the most ancient cultures, though tempered and as if humanized by its very refinement. Unlike the Aztecs—a young and barbarous nation, coming from the North as conquerors—old civilizations such as the Olmecs and Mayas had apparently been able to tame (or otherwise exorcise) the horror of death, concealing it under a thousand masks, embellishing it with ornaments like those that priests and dignitaries wear in images preserved in frescos at Bonampak. These were indeed aristocratic civilizations, founded on the religious interpretation of astronomical observations which one must consider admirable even today and which contrast tragically with the poverty of their agricultural tech niques. The only people of the New World to have developed a writ ing system, they have taken to the grave the secret of this haughty spirituality translated, for instance, in the grimace of the colossal heads of La Venta, inspired by the spectacle that these Lilliputians who are men offer to the Jaguar god by their mere existence. Tula's hieratic atlantes, transfixed in beholding the flame-red horizon, alone bear the weight of a sky as heavy as it is imponderable—a cloudless mineral sky which Toltec peasants feared above all else. The corn gods depicted on Zapotee "funerary" urns in the stereotyped form of seated figures, elbows on their knees, enveloped in glorious feathers, observe impassively the pathetic efforts of men who surrendered long ago to their fate as ephemeral creatures* It is, however, due to them and to their long-dead ancestors that Mexico must today be, according to Péret, "the only country in America that has preserved—often profoundly, as if hibernating and yet always alive and without a real solution of continuity—an artistic tradition of a scope and diversity that we would be hard pressed to find elsewhere, except perhaps in Peru, though to a less er extent and, it seems, in a less diversified fashion." Of course it would be simplistic to conclude that this tradition has been trans mitted unchanged over the centuries through a fertile history of wars, upheavals and disruptions of all kinds; however, it would be just as simplistic to try to explain the phenomenon as a resurgence of ancient sources which had disappeared with the Conquest and the implantation on indigenous soil of a religion and a colonial art— those of New Spain* Rather, according to Péret, we must attribute all this tradition's worth to the innate sense of artistry that any man possesses—however downtrodden his condition—in this land "not yet fully awakening from its legendary past," to quote André Breton's beautiful expression. Here more directly than elsewhere, the land shapes man into its image, and he in turn attempts to control the menacing powers. In this way, Xochipilli, the Aztec lord of flowers and poetry, opposes the terrifying incarnation of the telluric world that is Coatlicue. Those rock-crystal skulls—an accomplished ex pression of death's absoluteness, the beginning and the end of all things—and those sugar skulls that families nowadays leave on graves for the Day of the Dead carry the same feeling of hope as the trees of life that were a favorite subject matter for turn-of the-century folk artists* As threatened as it may be by mercantile interests, the work of artisans and anonymous artists—the work that Péret fell in love with fifty years ago—is still thankfully in its infancy. Many wonderful liberties have yet to be taken, and many opportunities have yet to arise to prove Hamlet a liar: the ques tion is thus not "to be or not to be," but to be everything at once—life and death inextricably mingling in the plumed serpent's twists and turns* Translated from the French by Richard Moszka* The Mists of Utopia Remedios Varo: Dream of the New World Lourdes Andrade All the things of the Indies are a miracle... they were all marvels... Baltazar Dorantes de Carranza In Mirtea Eliade's words, nostalgia (which gives the soul an aftertaste of yes teryear) had not been granted the attention it deserves until re cently. According to Eliade, the modern scientific man's spiritual un derbelly—as well as the common man's, traveling on the subway and sitting in cafes day after day—is "plagued by half-forgotten myths," like elements of a pre-logical past. Thus, yesterdays are like sediment accumulating in the nooks and crannies of the soul* Eliade also says that "'nostalgia,' even the most abject kind, masks the 'nos talgia for Paradise.'" But what paradise is this? And where is it? It can often be found, he states, far away in space and in time. It is the expression of a desire "for something completely different than the Lourdes Andrade</page><page sequence="9">73 present moment"—it is, most definitely, "Par adise Lost." Later, the author asserts that "the symbolism of 'earthly paradise' has lasted to this day, adopting the form of an 'oceanic Paradise,"' and that the fountain of eternal youth is an ever-present ingredient in the paradisiacal environment» Water, deep and unfathomable, could well serve as a metaphor for that boundless darkness that dwells within us. What lies hidden within our inner selves, behind our dreams? What lies beyond the ocean, on that yet unex plored shore that Columbus yearned to discover, sitting atop a cliff facing the crashing waves? Both the unconscious and the ocean are teeming with mysteries# If the voyage to America in the sixteenth century was indeed a great adventure, it can also be said that surrealism in the twentieth century was an incredible ad venture of the imagination. The conquista dors rushed across the unknown seas, while the surrealists leapt into the dark waters of the unconscious. The former found "exotic" wonders, while the latter came across strange "inner" treasures» Within Remedios Varo's body of work, we find baffled characters in the act of facing unexpected situations. Some of them make us think of that era's discoveries, of the first moment of confrontation between two different worlds. It seems odd that Varo's nostalgia would appear stronger at a time when she became more prolific (around 1953), urging her—no doubt unconscious ly—to depict a universe parallel to that realm teeming with "wonders" that her ancestors had found in the New World» Let us try to describe certain aspects of this par allelism. In the First Surrealist Manifesto, Breton writes, "Christopher Columbus had to surround himself with crazy people to discover America." In his History of Insanity, Foucault reminds us that during the Mid dle Ages the insane were forced to board ships on an undetermined course. StuT tifera navis—the ship of fools, travelers to unfathomable depths. Senseless caravels sail through Hieronymous Bosch's paintings. Those of Remedios Varo—who always de monstrated a liking for Bosch—feature boats that are just as delirious. These ships obviously do not look like conventional craft, and seem as strange to us as those first boats, floating on the waves like enormous waterborne buildings, must have seemed to American natives» "The me dieval world," writes Luis Weckmann in his book La herencia medieval de Méxi co (Mexico's Medieval Heritage), "was sur rounded by a series of real or imaginary islands"-—the islands of the "Ocean Sea" as Columbus termed it, or the mare tene brosum as it was known to various other determined navigators. Seven famous cities overflowing with riches, where King Solomon's mythical treasures were kept, lay beyond the sea. In Varo's canvases strange galleons make their way along mysterious paths, sometimes reaching certain legendary places that Renaissance adventurers sought out and found. It is said, for instance, that the Isle of Demons (or the Isle of Satan) "was always enshrouded in fog" and that this is how the wizards who lived there kept its treasures hidden away from sailors. And indeed the painting The World Beyond (1955) clearly depicts a great fog-covered island which seems to be surrounded by inde scribable riches. The Exploration of the Sources of the Orinoco River(1959) seems to evoke another legendary island, Bimini, with its fountain of eternal youth sprouting from the trunk of a tree surrounded by water gushing from the same spring» The extraordinary appearance of ships and strange islands is not the only surprising thing in these paintings. The waters, teeming with bizarre creatures, also harbor a delirious, disturbing fauna: mer maids, as in The Troubadour (1959); minotaurs, as in The Minotaur (1959) and Personage (1958); and other hybrids depicted in works such as The Cat Fern (1957), Bee in Pain (1957), Homo Rodans (1959) walk across her canvases and dwell in unknown lands, on mysterious islands, "spice islands" where treasure hordes of diamonds and pearls, are protected by fearsome monsters. In effect, to sixteenth-century explorers and specifically to Columbus, the presence of monstrous creatures was an unequivocal sign that a place harbored fab ulous wealth. These beings that had been glimpsed on several occasions fleeing from sailors' curiosity in the waters of the Caribbean, in tributaries of the Amazon, then reap pear in Remedios Varo's paintings, their disconcerting anatomies fully exposed»The amazing continent emerges somewhere between geography and desire, between the sea and mad ness, amidst waters inhabited by griffons, mermaids, cynocephali and dragons, amidst the fogs of classical myths and medieval legends. Columbus—who keenly followed the devel opment of voyages organized by the Portuguese and recounted certain myths that could spice up one's taste for seafaring—first thought that he had reached the East, and then that he had set anchor in Paradise on Earth, where our ancestors had lived long ago. Later Ponce de León confirmed the theory that he had found the Garden of Eden, where one can find among other things the fountain of eternal youth. Thousands of sailors followed, combing the seas in pursuit of a dream, one that was constantly renewed. The quest for an idyllic place continues to this day» At the time of the discovery, a world utterly unknown to European eyes opened itself up before the explorers, and the dreams they carried in their packs—as I said before—were inspired by classical mythology and medieval phantas magoria, lending a hallucinatory tone to their ventures. Mirror-images of wonders are reflect ed in their outlook on the New World: heroic feats, invincible monsters. Life is more fas cinating than fiction; reality and legend commingle. What is more, they create their own leg ends about the ships that crossed the seas toward "the unknown in absolute terms." Hence the residual nostalgia for this adventure lingers to this day. The nostalgia that Remedios Varo's painterly universe awakens in us has the same cast. It shows us unimaginable wonders while always keeping the mystery intact»Christopher Columbus is, in Luis Weckmann's words, "the last of the medieval travelers." He and his companions saw the New World with eyes veiled by the medieval "marvelous." To them the new lands were not peopled by unexpected crea tures but rather by those extraordinary beings about whom "they had learned from their an cient and medieval masters.'« Nonetheless, the crux of all the dreams was to find gold. Colum bus set off looking for the precious metal, just as André Breton set off looking for "the gold of</page><page sequence="10">74 time." But here it does not only represent material wealth. It can be alchemical gold, or a spiritual treasure which, in keeping with the tradition of the Argonauts, Henry the Navigator sought when he weighed anchor. Thus the "charmed knights" with their metal armor—who bear a kinship with conquistadors—became the transmutation's medium as well as its object. One path leading the way to the philosopher's stone made use of liquids, and in Varo's paintings, characters follow multiple tributaries, as in The Troubadour or in The Expedition of the Acqua Aurea (1962). There must be gold in the immediate surroundings of Paradise. It is Salomon's treasure, it is wisdom... Both ventures are based on a deep under lying spirituality: the Conquest, and the conquest of the medium of painting as undertaken by Remedios Varo like a stubborn alchemist. Water is, in the end, a purifying element. The sol diers on this crusade are mendicant friars. Franciscans, who followed their course from their places of origin to Cadiz, and from Veracruz to Mexico City, their painful journey evoked in The Arid Path (1962)*These golden treasures include that contained in the magic cup with whose conquest The Expedition of the Aqua Aurea culminates, and the cup that brimmeth over in The Exploration of the Sources of the Orinoco River. Here, Varo refers to the Orinoco tributary that Columbus reached on his third voyage, claiming that the Earthly Paradise, the realm of our original forefathers, was located there, as he states in his lettera rarísima to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. A place where animals talk and ripe fruit drops from trees that no one needs to cultivate. A situation of harmony with nature for which man, after the Fall, has not ceased to yearn* However, the most meaningful image from this perspec tive, the one that expresses the entire web of dreams woven around the New World and specifically around New Spain is Spiral Transit(1962). Here, as the fog lifts, our surprised gaze encounters the ultimate, most spectacular wonder of all: the waterborne city. Who has not dreamt of Mexico-Tenochtitlan? In spite of the current demographic disaster, the ozone, the noise, the traffic and the visual pollution of street merchandising, the dream endures: the Venice of America. To symbolize all the harmony, all the plenitude that one expected of this extraordinary place. Varo uses the only natural form contained in the gotden section—the spi ral. The galactic backbone, with its series of concentric circles linked by a continuous line— the universe's framework, the perfect figure. This city, with its towers, battlements and wide outer walls (like the fortifications found in sixteenth-century Mexico City), guided the sailors plying its waters toward its center—this ineffable space from which we measure the rest of the cosmos. It is the world's navel, the Great Tenochtitlan, with its geometric soul, its compass of stars, its cosmopolitan scope as the Empire's capital. To the conquistadors, it is the nucleus of the comet shedding light on their mystic dreams—their millennial and miltenarian dreams, their dreams of greatness and glory. To Varo, it is a dream of peace, stability, of an opportu nity to develop her life and art. When she settled here in 1941, Varo surrounded herself with cats and discovered the scope of the magical continent lying in her soul—that incredible landscape whose coordinates she gradually maps out on canvas. The fantastic geography she inhabits and the one that inhabits her (a mise-a-jour of ancient nostalgia) unite in her brushwork and in her vision, making this land her own. She died here, she lies here in this "land of asylum"— at heart, a muddy land of lakes from which emerge all our dreams* Translated by Richard Moszto* Utopia of Discovery Leonora Carrington's Magical World of the Mayas Luis Rius Caso In 1964, in a beautiful yet dramatic introductory text to the contemporary Mayan world and to Leonora Carrington's mural entitled The Magical World of the Mayas, anthropologist Laurette Séjourné wrote, "Indigenous people's resistance to bourgeois materialism comes from their stubborn quest for the soul, from their enigmatic urgency to communicate with the im perceptible, from their iron will to conquer unity through diversity. Thus it becomes clear that this humiliated world's irreducible core is made up of pure spirit and that these creatures, like frightened birds, are the bearers of a message that is of particular significance to us. Indeed, as devastated as the place may be 400 years [after the Conquest], the message that indigenous people keep defending may still be of use to us [...] because what it seems to wish to communicate is nothing less than the formula capable of curing this pernicious evil which consists of living in a state of self-alienation. By rejecting the merely anecdotal, Leonora Carrington has captured this essential truth with a magical clairvoyance and translated it with the powerful precision of a great poet."* Reviving beings through magic and poetry is certainly a tangible project in the mural—and in Carrington's work in gen eral—based on a subject matter featuring not ourselves but rather others, in the man ner of a mirror in which we recognize our selves for what we no longer are, for what we have already lost. Like so many other cultures, the Mayan one has been a con stant reference in very diverse imaginaries and poetics that have nourished Western culture from the time when the Other— or Otherness—was discovered, or better said, invented. That is why the virtual view er looking at the mural has, as a legitimate basis for his or her point of view, the pos sibility of understanding the notion of be holding others in order to behold him or herself, or more exactly, of inventing him or herself based on the invention of others. In the end. this is the basis of discourses which have reached us, for example, from the Lacandón Rainforest over the past few years, written in ink and blood, demanding historic restitution. I very deliberately add this reference to locate the most visible point on the horizon of meanings that the Mayan mirror now represents to us, with the purpose of referring back to the work made thirty-six years ago* The mural fulfills a spe cific function as it is (sometimes) exhibited in the National Museum of Anthropology and History's ethnological section, the place .for which it had been designed when the government commissioned Carrington to paint it. It is then a piece made for a deter mined purpose whose poetics (definitely Carrington's own) were fated to deal with a pre-established topic for which she of course felt great affinity and empathy. The mural's content consists of an artistic inter pretation of 1960s Mayan culture—always so effusively historical—in which the painter's imagination is revealed based on data ob tained from a deep and conscientious study of the topic, involving both historical sources (mainly Mayan codices and the Pspol Vuh) and scrupulous records of Mayan reality in situ (drawings rather than photographs, given indigenous peoples' fear of losing their souls by being photographed). Cafrington's Luis Rius Caso</page><page sequence="11">75 process also involved a constant exchange of information with specialists who were friends of hers, including Laurette Séjourné and Gertrude Blom. a Swiss anthropologist who introduced the artist to two shamans who allowed her to attend their cere monies. We cannot afford here to explore the interesting relationship of exchange be tween the artist and anthropologists, re calling in many ways the one between Co varrubias and Caso, for instance, or between Best Maugard and Franz Boas; but we must mention it in passing for those readers who might be interested in study ing the impact of these collaborations on the artistic process» The mural is then solid ly based on a knowledge of facts acquired from different perspectives, including Car rington's trips to the Lacandón area, which turned out to be an initiatory experience. As Whitney Chadwick states. "Trips to Chiapas in 1963 were a real adventure because the area was remote and local inhabitants did not always welcome foreigners. Sometimes Carrington took the bus from Mexico City to Oaxaca and from there to Tuxtla Gutié rrez. From that point travel proceeded on horseback or by mule. An alternate route was to take the train to Veracruz, and then continue the trip crossing the isthmus on an open wooden train."» Leonora Carring ton's records of people, animals and land scapes demonstrate her need to establish a basic relationship of trueness to that irre ducible reality, accurate in its every detail. We enter the mural at ground-level and im mediately realize human beings' difficult co existence with nature whose devastation is only understandable in terms of a universal totality where materiality can be sacrificed for the sake of the spiritual, so to speak, us ing the period's vocabulary. In this respect, the artist's visual description ratified Blom's efforts to avoid the deforestation of the Lacandón region and also Séjourné's words in the aforesaid introduction: "The more they were dispossessed of their means of survival these people could do nothing but fall back on their irreducible spiritual core, the only basis for their resistance, until it was stripped utterly bare. With intuitive ge nius. Leonora has understood that the uni verse of these descendents of the Maya has characterized itself for totally nullifying na ture. for having annihilated all materiality: in its shimmering totality, her painting seems to piously gather the light of a burnt-out star, a star that would have died ages and ages ago."» Human beings trapped by their gods, we should say, who need them to survive, however much stripped of their past splendor. They appear before our eyes thanks to the artist's spell which restores them to their former unity and does so not in an atemporal dimension but, it seems to me, in an original mythic time where the tension between contrary natures, extreme associations or the sacred and the profane disappears, where opposites cease to be perceived as such, in keeping with the purest André Breton thinking. In recovered mythical time, the cos mos acquires an original virginal dynamic. Beings and things move and belong to each other: each part belongs to the whole and the whole is reflected in each one of its parts. Sympathy and animism—magic's consubstantial qualities—come into play. Some hidden will creates a rainbow which crosses the scene and. felling upon the Earth, brings it to life; a face emerges from the ground and from its depths springs forth the naked image of Ix Chel—the Lady of the Rainbow, goddess of weaving, medicine, birth and the moon, according to the Popol Vuh. Ruled by an all-powerful movement, the cosmos' three levels are intimately and inexorably tied together: a ceiba tree pokes through the surface from the underworld (to the right of the mu ral)—it is the Mayas' sacred tree which attracts a flock of owls emerging from the eye of a be ing apparently inspired by a codex representation of the god Chac. From this figure's back ground. from its petrified calm, emanates its antithesis in extended wings and feathers (recall the aforesaid extreme associations). The underworld is ruled by the Jaguar god (at the mural's bottom right corner) and is the fateful abode of certain beings from Quiché mythology, such as the twin monkeys (to the left) who. though previously human, took on their present form when they were defeated by the heroic twins who then became the Sun and Moon. Human beings inhabit the surface, with their reduced scale, coexisting with beings and things of their everyday world but also with gods and mythological beings that exist both in their waking state and in their dreams, in their life and death. Times as well as beliefs commingle in a kind of bold syncretism underscored by the depiction of a church in the middle of the mural which bears a likeness to San Cristobal's Church of Santo Domingo. This syncretism is also emphasized by two structures at the base of either end of the rainbow: a Chamula Catholic church (with a sacred white lamb) on the left side, and, on the right, an indigenous hovel in which a shaman is performing a ritual Other divine and cosmic representations further highlight this syn cretism: above the rainbow (in the fore- and middle-ground) we see a disturbing figure—a benevolent incarnation of Chac. the rain god. followed by a motif probably associated with Kukulkán and by a beautiful composition which Chadwick interprets as a multicolored an cestor of the hummingbird, representing the Sun and Moon.» Human beings' size has been ac curately interpreted in terms of its scale vis-a-vis divinity. The divine is conceived as immense, contrasting with the humans' minute stature. The latter are a tiny part of the much more ex pansive being that is the cosmos, which in turn is an integral component of human beings. In this regard we can venture a comparison: let us recall the magnificent clay figurines found on the Isle of Jaina and also the enormous buildings left by Mayan civilization. The former measure no more than a foot in height and are faithful, minutely detailed portraits of people featuring their gestures and even the tiniest elements of their wardrobe. They were true-to life effigies made for the gods that accompanied the dead, who were covered in cinnabar red to symbolize blood and buried in a fetal position inside an urn, symbolizing a womb. On the other hand, architecture and most religious sculpture are based on abstractions and as pire to be of god-like magnitude. The comparison is relevant because both the figurines and Carrington's mural refer to the same human scale, and because the artist's descriptive intent seems to have respected (or coincided with) this code of representation» All in all, ancient people's interrelationships, as well as their relationship with the cosmos, were "personal" and concrete, rather than abstract and impersonal like our own. Magic was a dominant pres ence among them (the "science of the concrete." to quote Lévy Strauss) and this is why any activity they undertook acquired so much sense within the cosmos' dynamic system— whether it was religious, like church processions or a witchdoctor's healing cerehnonies, or everyday acts such as singing, sowing fields, sheep herding and conversation. And thesé com monplace events are perhaps the most eloquent references to a reality whose every facet is filled with meaning: from the most trivial deeds to those involving the most complex metaphysics. Thus, thanks to invocations based on everyday acts, we glimpse a reality much</page><page sequence="12">76 more complex in terms of its composition due to the cosmic meaning (of totality) it acquires. I remember certain famous paintings by Carrington—like Pastoral or Lepidoptera—in which events such as a meal or a day in the country are depicted in such a way that each object di vulges its most precise nature, metamorphosing according to the renewed unity of its envi ronment. In this mural—as in practically all of Carrington's work—beings and things are cap tured at the very instant when they have acquired their greatest definition, as Lezama Lima would say* As we have seen, Carrington's iconography is based on thorough research, but it is not for this reason that we should try to merely discover ethnic, historical or mythologi cal motifs in her work. The signs that this artist uses acquire the quality and/or the singular ity of the represented objects, but above all they stem from a particular, more precise sys tem of meaning: the artist's own poetics. For instance, the animals depicted—tapirs, wild boars, deer, spider monkeys, leopards, the quetzal bird perched atop the church at San Cristóbal, etc.— are the result of meticulous studies she carried out in the Tuxtla Gutiérrez zoo; however, they are also inspired by a poetics which comes to life in every work, and to which every work refers. We mention this so as to spark our readers' curiosity in further ex ploring this artist's vision of the world—one which, in the end, continues to lend her in terpretation of the Mayan world a surprising topicality. Indeed, nothing has remained un changed since 1964 (the year the mural was made) to this day. Historical time has been caught up in a process of constant acceleration, and our referents have changed dramatically over the past few years—especially our outlook on the Mayan world, radically altered due to the events of January 1994. In this vast region of southeastern Mexico, times, cultures, races, ide ologies and customs have commingled more and more, and this at once bears witness to an inconcluded modernist project and to an incredibly complex reality, incomparable in its concrete magical aspect. However, in my mind, Carrington's mural is still amazingly topical, not only—it goes without saying—for its artistic value, but for the contemporaneity of its symbolic content. Under that beautiful light I would like to describe as somewhere between dusk and dawn—that moment when it is unclear whether the sun is setting or rising—we can recognize, in the symbolization of Kukulkán, the god Chac, the two pairs of twins or the Catholic- church, the great forces and great reasons behind a desire for the absolute: the State, economic interests, ideologies, various religions, etc. We can also perceive in the Maya man, meticulously portrayed in the 1960s, the Maya of today in his inexorable state of sub jection to—or constant tension with—these powers: asserting his condition as subject. In this mirror, we can still try to discern the scale of the Other as well as our own, repeating that dis turbing operation of inventing our own selves based on the invention of the Other. Today, as- in the 1960s, signs can become transparent symbols* In spite of its quality, the work we mention here is little known. The reason is simple: it was made for the National Museum of Anthropology and History's permanent collection rather than for a contemporary art institu tion. Therefore it has been moved several times, thus making viewing difficult. In my opin ion, it should remain in a space such as the Museum of Anthropology where the bound aries of the artistic are not clearly delineated, this circumstance indeed adding to its topicality. Moreover, I would suggest that it is urgent that the art public be made aware of its exis tence, and the publication of a monograph including the articles that several specialists have written about it would go far toward this end* Translated by Richard Moszkat, Utopia of the Hand Sea Mirror, or Wood Carved in Dreams: José Horna Eloísa Urlbe Norah was on the brink of her tenth birthday, and as a gift, she asked her father for an object that would allow her to see the immensity of the sky: "I want to know what Heaven is like," she said. José looked at her, then turned on his heel and disappeared down the stairs and into his workshop. There, holding a piece of cedar, he stood thinking for a long while. Every day, Kati peeked in to watch him work and take a few pho tographs. Lost in his carving, José gave shape to the wood, clearly demon strating his calling as a creator and a craftsman. Finally, October 20 arrived, and Norah received her birthday present. Before her, there was a wooden box that brought to mind a case for a strange musical instrument drawn in some book of fairy tales. The polished lid awak ened her desire to touch it, to feel under her fingers the smooth surface concealing a soli tary monocle. From the depths and through the circular opening, an arcane eye peered out. It pervaded the girl's mind and spirit, astonished by the transparent blue gaze of the marble* Many years earlier, in 1939, José Horna and his wife Kati had left Paris seek ing refuge in Mexico. With the defeat of the Spanish republicans, they were forced to abandon Europe due to their prior collab oration with that government. Once on Mexican soil, they formed close friendships with the surrealists who, in those days, con stituted a group of creators and friends that pursued the same aesthetic tendencies and similar ideals in life. After the initial com plex years of adaptation, and energized by the climate of fertility and openness that prevailed in Mexican cultural circles, the couple devoted themselves to artistic cre ation, making this country their permanent home* The surrealists, like many other poets and painters who sought refuge in this country, fled Europe for fear of losing their lives at the hands of their adversaries, and to avoid the terrors of war, violence, injustice and death. The indefinable pres ence of André Breton lingered on among the members of the group of surrealists. Breton had traveled to the New World car rying in his baggage the prodigy and the hope of continuing his battle in defense of poetry in New York. Other artists took their place in the surrealist horn of plenty, in cluding the Hornas: they had congregated around several ideas that had been set out in the surrealist manifestos of 1924 and 1929, and devoted their lives as well as their art to the reconstruction of a forgotten real ity, negated by the cultural discourse an chored in scientific reasoning—on its death bed in the wake of the two world wars* Their promise for the future placed its bets on non-rational aspects of human life and the endless quest for other dimensions. Their recovery of the ancient knowledge of alchemy, the worfd of dreams, the unconscious, magic and poetry, as well as of laughter made daily life seem less sterile, Eloísa Uribe</page><page sequence="13">77 less like an operating theater» Horna. who traditional art histories have associated with the surrealist movement, produced works using the perspective of many very diverse aesthetic languages, the results of the exper iments of so-called avant-garde artists in the early twentieth century. However, with his edu cation and creative abilities, he imposed his own peculiar style upon the transformed material. As a student at the San Fernando School in Madrid. Horna began using drawing to represent the geometry and perspective that so concerned those who wished to break with academic tradition. He and his friends Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo sustained more than a few pleasurably rambling discussions on the spatial struc ture of their paintings, which lent their canvases an atmosphere of erudition and ancestral wisdom» His preparation at the school in Madrid and his professional experience in Barcelona came into full bloom with his poster designs, using a composition reminiscent of that typical to Polish posters: large chromatic areas that give body to the figures arranged in a composition of diagonal tensions. This style was not unlike that seen in Mexican graphic arts at the time—visu al devices which the eye instantly recognizes in the fleeting encoun ters permitted by the rush of city life. Horna added yellow, orange or blue to the predominant red and black on a white background, cre ating a visual language with the clear influence of movie advertising posters, with their dialogue among the living scraps of films—little studied images, scenes from films, portraits of screen idols, mirrors of the fantasies and dreams of Mexicans—that sparked the interest of spectators outside movie theaters» Horna was a man capable of laughing and playing like a child; he loved to design toys, and even went so far as to set up a small toy factory. He had already made a dollhouse for Norah, complete with courtyards, staircases and bal conies. plants climbing up the walls, lamps that really lit up. a stained glass window and an upstairs room that still holds a gift from Leonora Carrington: a tiny bed with a canopy and curtains which can be pulled back to reveal the face of a yellow cat painted on the high headboard to watch over the bed's sleeping occupant» Leonora Carrington and José Horna created a number of objects out of wood together, including a "horse race" for mass production, which captures the movement of the competition in a circle dominated by a spiral carved into the center. By turning a wooden crank affixed in the middle, the two-dimensional carrousel begins to spin. This is also a game of chance that lends itself to riddles and betting by means of the numbers accompanying the delicately formed tiny horses. Drawn by the two friends, the detailed paintings reveal the knowledge both possessed of these animals, rivaled only by the love Carrington (like any good Englishwoman) and Horna (as a passionate Andalusian) had for horses. Once again, this game involves the uncertainties of fate and a sense of humor, because anyone who bets on the cabal istic number seven will place his hopes on the figure of a gray don key trotting among the other members of the cavalcade* José Horna and Leonora Carrington. who crossed the Atlantic Ocean (just three years apart) to find their new home on Mexican soil, also envi sioned and built a cradle in the form of a boat perpetually rocked by the waves. Horna painstakingly carved the primitive little craft with heavy forms, balancing the hull atop twc :ylinders of different Kati Horna. Norah in the cradle-boat carved by José Horna and painted by Leonora Carrington. Ca 1945 © All rights reserved. diameters so that the hull, suspended at an angle to the base, would appear to be in constant motion; a wooden wave, like a fragment of a musical instrument, or the allusion to a ready-made taken from among the remains of old furniture at the family res idence. An astral vessel, the refuge of illusions and bearer of a painting by Leonora Carrington: a procession heading in the opposite direction to that of the boat, a whimsical parade from bow to stern that is a hushed recital of a person's life journey. A passenger in transit who encounters magic and the fantastic stories of our elders even in childhood dreams» Horna's sculptural work is surprising in more ways than one: for the tactile invitation of the surface texture of his carv ings. for the profiles that are at once rounded and sharp and for his references to multiple languages and discourses from the past and from his own time. In them converge the secrets of the wood begot ten by magnificent trees nourished from the darkness of their roots, and the impression of female forms, of the mother goddesses of yore, associated with the presence of the tree—a sacred symbol and the image of cosmic fertility, as explained in Jean Hani's study of black virgins» An example of this is a small statue Horna named Libra. with a disturbing blindfold of natural hair, a frond wrapped across her eyes, blinding her to the world and forcing her to focus on the judg ments of her understanding. She bears the arms of a pair of scales on her shoulders, while her own body is elongated like the fulcrum of the device. The needle indicating whether the pans hanging from the sides are balanced or unbalanced vacillates in front of her. The water bearer with the pitchers of justice on her back appears to be walking: the forward leg is barely outlined beneath the delicate cloth covering her—a position reminiscent of Egyptian statuary. Another sculpture of feminine forms and fabulous harmony is Spider Woman. from whose four long arms dangle an equal number of hands, like bluebells with corollas reaching toward the earth, while the arach nid in question—frozen in time by some taxidermist—creeps silent ly up her back: a surprising presence that the spectator discovers with the same shudder that the wooden figure might have experi enced. Finally. Marionette, created for a puppet theater imagined by Leonora Carrington. is like a winged insect; like a woman suspended by the threads operated by the will of another: like a musical instru ment with taut strings: an image that recalls those cherished moments when Horna strummed his guitar, as well as his fondness for the instrument and for flamenco music—recollections of his native Jaén, from the summers on the Río Guadalquivir to the snow of the Sierra Morena» His carvings are also related to the pleasure of the direct contact of the gouge with the wood, a technique appre ciated by any artist who tried to distance himself from the modeling method then dominant in sculptural expression, which still followed the methods of academic tradition in the early twentieth century. In Mexico, the use of this sculptural treatment—considered to be one of renewal—was spread thanks to the Free School of Direct Sculpting and Carving, which encouraged rough surface work leaving the chisel marks clearly visible. Besides the school, there were certain sculptors (such as Manuel Martinez Pintao, who had come from Galicia to make his home in Mexico) who worked the wood to produce an effect similar to the stone reliefs seen on thf faqades of colonial Mexican Kati Horna. Norah in the cradle-boat carved by José Horna and painted by Leonora Carrington. Ca. 1945 © All rights reserved.</page><page sequence="14">78 churches» Other influences can be seen in José Horna's carving. Medieval reminiscences are found in the slendemess of the bodies that appear to float above the Earth like the silent enti ties inhabiting the paintings of Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo. One can also note a kinship between his work entitled Taurus and the objects that Wolfgang Paalen and Alice Rahon constructed from different kinds of bones, since the sculpture looks like a bull's head found in the desert, as much for the gaping eye sockets as for the bone-like treatment of the surface and the horns. Objects that recall that well-known obsession with death that subsisted among the surrealists. Finally, Horna's sculptures betray a distant relationship with the mannequins that burst onto the art scene in the early twentieth century as part of the ready-made trend and as acknowledgement of the drama and the tragedy that is life. This is the origin of the white masks that Kati Horna repeatedly placed on the small sculptures for which she created gardens planted with marbles and broken mirrors. A pallid mask, the incessant echo of itself, a spectral face recreated in human dimensions that the artist placed on the tangled sheets of a bed. Being without being, without a body, mourned by a dis traught woman in that scene that Kati set up as part of her photographic oeuvre* Looking at José Horna's sculptures again, I'd have to say that the arrangement of the finely tuned strings forming the wings of his Marionette is not unlike that of the taut lines created by the constructivists Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner to reassign the value of space and the volume of the sculpture. Physical bodies composed of empty spaces, dynamic material which the slender ligatures maintain united. Transparency, weightlessness and movement that in Horna's work, take on the appearance of an imaginary insect* All these loans enrich the language of Horna's sculptures, and in no way diminish the formal abundance and the aesthetic mystery that each spectator must discover in the work of an artist who placed no limits on the usage of very diverse materials—as if he had read Humberto Boccioni's futurist manifesto—when expression obliged him to combine them: wood, hair, glass, thread and green stone (as the heart in the bosom of Libra): paper, marbles and a blue mirror that reveal their close ties to surrealism. Surrealist thought opens the limits of its aesthetic to the beauty of the found object, because to Breton, such objects possessed a revealing power similar to that of dreams, given that in both cases the individual is found, in Breton's words, to be "free of paralyzing affective scruples."»Just a few days before receiving the invitation from Lourdes Andrade to write these lines on the patent and hidden beauty of José Horna's sculptures, I found among my things a blue glass marble which, together with a silver sphere given to me by Lourdes, I had forgotten in a drawer for the space of several years. I dusted it off and once again, it became the object of endless visual scrutiny. Weeks later, I held the marine box in my hands, opened the natural wooden case and stood looking at the con tents. Then I touched the rounded contours of the fish, ran my fingertips over the incisive spines, and let them linger in the cavities. I recognized the aquatic being whose only eye turns toward the four cardinal directions: He who sees and lets himself be seen. Inhabitant and guardian of the sky-sea, blue mirror under the protection of his border of bones. Safeguard of the sea which is the sky, as in the hermetic formula, "what is up is down," and vice versa— a tradition that defined more than one medieval European work and then traveled to America as a heritage concealed among the dreams of the friars who built and painted churches and monasteries*There are privileges bestowed by existence that are still seen as accidents or coincidences, privileges the surrealists understood as "objective chance" and which respond to the very essence of life. That was how I found out that Horna awoke the great water insect from a fragment Of Cedar* Translated by Michelle Suderman« Utopia of the Eye Buñuel the Poet Octavio Paz The appearance of La edad de oro (The Golden Age) and Un perro andaluz (An Andalusian Dog) marked the first conscious irruption of poetry in the art of cinema. This marriage between the filmic image and the poetic image as instigators of a new reality was bound to seem scan dalous and subversive. And it was. The subversive quality of Buñuel's early films lies in the fact that those ghostly conventions (whether they be social, moral or artistic) which constitute our reality collapse when barely touched by the hand of poetry. And from the ruins there arises a new truth: that of man and his desire. Buñuel shows us that by just closing its eyes, shackled mankind can make the world explode. These films are more than a ferocious attack on so-called reality: they represent the revelation of another reality, one humiliated by contemporary civilization. The man in The Golden Age sleeps within each one of us and only awaits a sign to awake: the sign of love. This film is one of those rare attempts in modern art to lay bare the terrible face of love in freedom* Buñuel later exhibited Tierra sin pan (Land Without Bread), a documentary that is also a masterpiece in its genre. In this film Buñuel the poet withdraws and remains silent so as to allow reality to speak for itself. If the sub ject matter of Buñuel's surrealist films is man's struggle against a reality that mutilates and strangles him, that of Land Without Bread is the soul-destroying triumph of that same reality. This documentary is thus the necessary complement to his earlier cre ations. It explains them and justifies them. By different routes he continues his bitter fight with reality. Or rather against it. His realism, like that of the best Spanish tradi tion (Goya, Quevedo, the picaresque novel, Valle-lnclán, Picasso), consists of a savage hand-to-hand with reality. When he em braces it, he tears it to shreds. That is why his art has no relation whatsoever to the more or less tendentious, sentimental or aesthet ic descriptions of what we normally call realism. On the contrary, all his work tends to provoke the irruption of what is secret and precious, what is terrible and pure, what is hidden precisely by our reality. Whether he uses dreams and poetry or the resources of film narrative, Buñuel the poet descends to the depths of human experience, to its most radical and unexpressed intimacy* After many years of silence Buñuel has presented a new film: Los olvidados (The Young and the Damned). If we compare this film to those he made with Salvador Dalí, what is really surprising is the rigorous way in which Buñuel carries his early intu itions to their limit. On the one hand, The Young and the Damned signals a peak of artistic maturity: on the other, it reveals a greater and more encompassing sense of desperation: the door of dreams seems to be closed forever: only the door of blood is</page><page sequence="15">79 open. Without denying the great experience of his youth, but aware of the changing times which have given greater consistency to the reality he condemned in his first works, Buiiuel has constructed a film in which the action has a clockwork precision, hallucinatory like a dream, relentless like the silent flow of lava. The plot of The Young and the Damned—delinquent childhood—has been taken from criminal archives. The characters are our contemporaries and are as old as our children. Yet The Young and the Damned is more than a realist film. Dream, desire, horror, delirium and chance, the dark side of life, also have a part to play. And the weight of the reality they show us is so appalling that it finally seems impossible and unbearable. And that is how it is: reality is unbearable, and because he cannot bear it, man kills and dies, loves and creates* The Young and the Damned is governed by the strictest artistic economy. The greater condensation is matched by a more intense explosion. That is why it is a film with no "stars." This also explains the discrete "background music," which doesn't try to displace what cinematographic music owes to the eyes. And finally there is the disdain for local color. Shunning any temptation to exploit the grandeur of the Mexican landscape, the setting is limited to the sordid and insignificant desolation of an urban landscape in its eternal relentlessness. The physical and human space in which the drama is played out could hardly be more enclosed: the life and death of a few children who have delivered themselves into the hands of fate, trapped within the four walls of destitution. The city, with all the human solidarity that this word implies, harbors what is alien and strange. What we call civilization is for them no more than a wall, a gigantic No that blocks the way. These children are Mexican but they could be from anywhere, inhabitants of any suburb of another great city. In a certain sense they do not live in Mexico or anywhere else: they are the forgotten ones, the inhabitants of those wastelands spawned by every modern city at its edges. A world closed in on itself, a world in which every act is circular and every step takes us back to our point of departure. Nobody can get out of it or out of themselves except through the long street of death. Chance, which in other worlds can open doors, closes them here* The constant presence of chance in The Young and the Damned has a special significance that does not allow us to identify it with fate. The chance that governs the action of the heroes is presented as a necessity that nonetheless might not have happened. (So why not call it by its real name—destiny, the name it has in tragedy?) Ancient fate functions once more, although free of its supernatural attributes: now we are faced with social and psychological fate. Or, if we prefer to use the magical word of our times, the new intellectual fetish: his torical destiny. It is not enough, however, for society, history or cir cumstance to be hostile to the heroes: in order for a catastrophe to take place these determining factors have to coincide with human will. Pedro fights against chance, against his bad luck or his evil shad ow, as represented by Jaibo: when trapped, he accepts and faces it, transforming fate into destiny. He dies, but it is his own death. The essence of the tragic act lies in the conflict between human con sciousness and external fate. Buñuel has rediscovered this fundamen tal ambiguity: without human complicity destiny cannot be fulfilled and tragedy is impossible. Fate wears the mask of freedom: and free dom, that of fate* The Young and the Damned is not a documen tary. Neither is it a thesis work of propaganda or morality. Although its marvelous objectivity is unspoiled by preaching, it would be false to say that it is an aesthetic film in which only artistic values are important. Far removed from the social, psychological or edifying ver sions of realism, far removed from aestheticism, Buñuel's film belongs to the artistic tradition of violence and passion, restraint and deliri um, the tradition that descends from Goya and Posada, who are per haps the artists that have taken black humor further than anyone. Cold lava, volcanic ice. In spite of its universal theme, its lack of local color and the extreme simplicity of its construction, The Young and the Damned has a tone we are obliged to call racial (in the sense that bulls can be said to have pedigree). Destitution and neglect can occur anywhere in the world, but the fierce passion with which they are described here belongs to the great tradition of Spanish art. We rec ognize the blind beggar from the Spanish picaresque. All those wom en, drunkards, cretins, murderers and innocents come straight out of the pages of Quevedo and Galdós. We have glimpsed them in Cervantes or seen them in the paintings of Velázquez and Murillo. Those sticks—blindmen's canes—are the same ones we hear in all Spanish drama. What is and can only be Mexican are the children, the dispossessed with their mythology, passive rebellion, suicidal loyalty, flashes of kindness and tenderness brimming with delicious ferocity, their heart-rending self-affirmation in the face of death as they assume their fate, their endless search for communion, even through crime. Thus, in the key sequence of the film—the dream scene— the maternal theme finds its resolution in the communal supper, the sacred feast. In the dream of his heroes, Buñuel discovers, per haps unintentionally, the archetypal images of the Mexican people: Coatlicue and sacrifice. The obsessively Mexican theme of the moth er is inexorably linked to that of fraternity, that of friendship until death. Both provide the secret content of this film. The world of The Young and the Damned is inhabited by orphans, lonely beings who long for communion and are undeterred even by blood in their pur suit of it. The search for the other, our fellow being, is the comple mentary aspect of the search for the mother. Or the acceptance of a final absence: the realization that we are alone. Accordingly, Pedro, Jaibo and their companions reveal to us the essential nature of mankind, which is perhaps no more than constant and permanent orphanhood* In bearing witness to our times, the moral value of The Young and the Damned has nothing to do with propaganda. When it is free, art always offers testimony and awareness. Buñuel's work is proof of what creative talent and artistic consciousness can achieve when restricted or coerced by nothing more than their own free dom* Translated by Anthony Stanton* Utopian Landscape A Spirit's Dream José Rubén Romero Galván No, Xilitla is not nearby. Xilitla is an apparently sleepy town among high mountains erratically arranged in an endless chain. The predominant color here is green, but never a single, uniform green. There are so many tones of green here that I am quite certain that no names exist to designate them all* The region's dampness, given its many rivers and streams, envelops visitors in mist thick with the smell of the promised land. Doubtless, it is an area of paradise we do not know about since it remained outside the boundaries that the angels established when they banished Adam and Eve* But green dampness Anthony Stantoni José Rubén Romero Galván</page><page sequence="16">80 is not Xilitla's only characteristic. The town also has a very long history. It bears an indigenous name, allowing us to assume that these lands had been settled by Huaxtecs before the coming of Spaniards. According to the chronicles of old. these people were prone to indulge in sensuous and even riotous pleasures, though this could have been due to the influence of an environment so overwhelming in terms of moods and sensations» Ancient documents of New Spain state that the Crown ere ated an outpost here around 1537 and that by 1550. the Augustinians had begun to build a monastery which is open to visitors to this day* I can clearly recall my trip to Xilitla. It was a beautiful experience. I boarded a second-class bus that stopped in every village on its route. I still feel overwhelmed by the landscapes that the slow ride allowed me to behold—steep slopes, waterfalls, mountains that seemed to want to rip through the sky. and greenness, always green ness. I was told to ask the driver to let me off at a mysterious spot called the "Y." just past Tamazunchale. When we got there—a place which indeed seemed very remote from anything—the bus driver let me know I had reached my destination by simply yelling out "the Y." I had hardly set foot outside when I realized I was not the only one awaiting a local minibus to Xilitla. Where had these people come from? I still wonder. Our bus arrived, those of us who could fit got in. and thus commenced the last leg of my trip to Xilitla* It was just getting dark when the town appeared ahead of us. Through the grayness. Xilitla seemed much like many other Mexican towns, with straight streets, a square, a church (this one from the sixteenth cen tury), a market and houses from many different eras: a veritable cat alogue of lay architecture in which materials and shapes are arranged in such a way as to lend each building an aspect of surprise—I find no other word to describe it* Very early the following day I went walking along the road leading me towards what was truly my trip's final destination: "the Englishman's house." But it was not a house after all—at least not in the way one would imagine. In the middle of the forest, surrounded by a sea of endless greens, stand the whimsical, gravity-defying, dreamlike structures that are known as a whole as "the Englishman's house."* What everyone in the town calls the house lets itself be felt, imposing itself upon you from the moment you enter it. Feelings accumulate, combine, fall softly on you. No one entering this place may remain untouched by what he or she sees, feels, smells, hears... what could the soil taste like here? I now regret not having put it on my tongue. If I were to know what it tast.. like, this house would have penetrated me through all the senses o' try to remember the path I followed. I want to recall what I saw i it, what I sav&gt; ater. what I saw toward the end. Impossible... everything i umblec id in my mind. From it emerge the surprising images of v, at I disc vered. Curiously. I have never seen a map of these constructions. There must be one. but I think it does not mat ter to anyone. I believe this is because the arrangement of the struc tures as a whole does not matter. What does matter is what our eyes r&gt;°nold within them, what our skin feels, what we hear and smell... oefore this sea of sensations, order is not important* I was tempted se»'~ral time*, to equate these structures with a stage setting. Jorge Vertiz. WindowtotheSky. Xilitla, San Luis Potosí. 1982-1983. But the comparison was faulty be cause the constructions seemed to sprout out of the forest—they were not add-ons nor extraneous bodies. There was a surprising harmony be tween each building and its surround ings. Here, for instance, the forest had given birth to a bulbous mass, an erect, gravity-defying body serving as a shaft for a staircase whose only apparent function was climbing and curling around it; or there, that wall of bamboo stems, lithe and very upright next to one another, which had no other reason for being than to separate the forest from the forest; or further on. that huge garden that one entered through an iron gate and which was nothing but a garden within a garden. This. then, was no longer a stage setting. It was a dream sur rounded by forest, born out of it* I also remember another construc tion that was simply the transept of a Gothic church and could easi ly have been drawn from a pre-Raphaelite painting. The impact that this construction had on me lay in the harmony between this build ing that drew its inspiration from such a remote source and what sur rounded it. It was as if the forest had had the amazing ability to make this Gothic transept emerge from it. It was all still a dream surround ed by forest* The house is definitely not a house. It is much more than that. It is a dream of a misty wood that a noble Englishman dreamt one night. Sir Edward James, who was said to be the natural grandson of Edward VII. King of England, came to this remote out post of Mexico where he managed to discover—or one might say decipher—paradise. A swarm of white butterflies fluttering around one of his friends made him see that Xilitla was a place filled with magic. At that mysterious moment filled with the whiteness of the insects which must have contrasted beautifully with the greens of the forest, a unique project was conceived. To build an abode be yond the edges of reality. This project can only be understood if we approach, tentatively and very discreetly. Sir Edward James him self* A patron of Dalí, a friend of Picasso's, a friend and model of Magritte's—the latter portrayed him in a marvelous painting where James has his back to the viewer, facing a mirror that instead of reflecting his face and revealing his identity, once again portrays the figure with his back to the viewer—James had a profound knowledge of surrealism. To say that he knew about it is to say very little: he lived with it. Indeed, the costly project of his "house" in Xilitla is irrefutable proof of this* "The Englishman's house" is the fruit of true surrealist spirit. A revolutionary spirit, forever striving to enter a higher reality in which dreams are all-powerful and in which thought is a sublime game bearing unexpected fruits. Surrealism strove to break the chains of reality. This was given physical existence in that house in Xilitla— born of Edward James' free spirit, engendered by the damp, green, sensation-filled forest, conceived by a spirit molded by its belonging to an exquisite core group of great artists* Certainly Xilitla is not near by. It is true that Xilitla is a town that seems to sleep among high mountains. But above all Xilitla is the place where a treasure is kept, one within everyone's reach. Surrounded by greens whose tones are as unnamable as they are countless, the Englishman's house stands, defying time and frustrating the most elemental logic—the dream of Sir Edward James' spirit* Translated by Richard A/toszfo* Jorge Vertiz.
