Rice Using tr Trade books can be a valuable 1 addition to the science curriculum, if teachers know how to select * good ones. 1 ade books in :eaching elementary science: Facts and fallacies One day while waiting for a colleague in reading education to complete a phone call, I picked up a children's trade book lying on her desk and casually be gan to glance through it. After her call, she not ed my interest in the book. She explained to me how wonderful it was and suggested that it would be a good book to use in teaching ele mentary science. As a science educator, I dis agreed because of inaccuracies I had noticed in the book. We embarked on a discussion, almost a de bate, about using trade books in science teaching. This dialogue continued over the next several weeks and eventually sparked our collaboration on a research project to explore the use of trade books in science classes. Specifically, we wanted to look at whether or not children develop accu rate science concepts from trade books used in science instruction. Using trade books in teaching science: A growing trend For generations, trade books have been a rich part of childhood. Most of us remember reading with a parent before bedtime or hiding under the covers with a flashlight, trying to fin ish those last few pages of a captivating story or novel. Many of us remember anticipating the next exciting chapter in the book our teacher was reading to us during quiet time after lunch each day. The titles may vary but the memories are quite similar. Though trade books have remained a staple of pleasure reading for elementary children, the role of trade books in elementary instruction has expanded, particularly in the content areas. In science classes, trade books or "library" books were initially used as supplements to science in struction (Blough, 1973). As more teachers adopted an integrated approach to teaching, the range of trade books that found their way into the science curriculum broadened to include not only science informational books, but also fic tion, science fiction, and even poetry (Casteel &amp; Isom, 1994; Ediger, 1995; Lamartino, 1995; Nordstrom, 1992; Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993). Recently, trade books have even begun to re place science texts in some elementary science classes (Armbruster, 1993; Ross, 1994). While the use of trade books in teaching sci ence has grown increasingly popular, there is very little quantitative support for their use in science classes (Royce &amp; Wiley, 1996). A num ber of important questions remain unanswered. What evidence is there that children are learning "good science" from trade books? Is the content in trade books accurate enough to serve as a sub stitute for content provided by traditional sci ence texts? If not, what is an appropriate role for trade books in the elementary science class? Using trade books in teaching science: The right reasons There are many pragmatic reasons for the growing popularity of trade books in teaching elementary science. One is their widespread 552 The Reading Teacher Vol. 55, NO. 6 MarCh 2002 ?2OO2 International Reading Association (pp. 552-565)</page><page sequence="2">availability from local bookstores, professional sources, and commercial catalogs (Kralina, 1993). The number of trade books published each year has increased tenfold since 1900 (Lynch-Brown &amp; Tomlinson, 1998). This geo metric growth has resulted in over 120,000 chil dren's books in print today (Lynch-Brown &amp; Tomlinson, 1999). Because trade books are so easily integrated into whole language and the matic curricula, they have become "readily ac cepted by educators and heavily promoted by publishers" (Mayer, 1995, p. 16). Problems with science texts have been a ma jor force driving the trend toward using trade books in elementary science. Not only are trade books more widely available (Kralina, 1993; Lynch-Brown &amp; Tomlinson, 1999; Walpole, 1999), they are generally more up to date than the science texts found in many elementary classrooms (Moss, 1991; Ross, 1994; Tyson &amp; Woodward, 1989). Science texts can be daunting for many children, particularly those who have reading problems. Texts often contain unfamiliar vocabulary (Casteel &amp; Isom, 1994; Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993; Tyson &amp; Woodward, 1989) and tend to cover a large number of topics (Lamartino, 1995; Tyson &amp; Woodward, 1989). Trade books, on the other hand, tend to be more focused and provide an in-depth look at single concepts (Cullinan, 1981; Moss, 1991; Ross, 1994). Teachers find trade books to be an attractive option because trade books can ac commodate differences in reading abilities of students (Carlile, 1992; Gee &amp; Olson, 1992; Lamartino, 1995; Nordstrom, 1992; Ross, 1994) and also provide for differences in learning styles (Madrazo, 1997). Trade books are generally more interesting and less confusing for children than texts (Ross, 1994). Butzow and Butzow (2000) pointed out that children's books have story lines that help children understand and remember concepts bet ter than textbooks that tend to present science as lists of facts to be memorized. Trade books con tain colorful pictures and the graphics are supe rior to many texts for explaining abstract ideas (Kralina, 1993). Trade books also provide a con text for understanding difficult science concepts (Dole &amp; Johnson, 1981). Both fiction and non fiction can be used to support the inquiry ap proach to teaching science (Nordstrom, 1992; Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993), to facilitate the development of problem-solving skills (Daisey, 1994; Ediger, 1995), to introduce the scientific method and the excitement of discovery (Janke &amp; Norton, 1983), and to enhance creativity and thinking skills (Kralina, 1993). Many children simply find science textbooks too boring (Dole &amp; Johnson, 1981; Moss, 1991). In contrast, trades are fun to read (Kralina, 1993; Nordstrom, 1992), are more interesting and rele vant to students' lives (Butzow &amp; Butzow, 2000; Dole &amp; Johnson, 1981; Hammond, 1992; Kralina, 1993; Maria &amp; Junge, 1993; Stiffler, 1992), and less intimidating (Carlile, 1992; Casteel &amp; Isom, 1994; Crook &amp; Lehman, 1990; Dole &amp; Johnson, 1981). They have been shown to positively affect self-esteem and social skills (Kralina, 1993) and have also been cited as pre senting a more human side of science than do textbooks (Huck as cited in Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993; Kralina, 1993; Ross, 1994). Advocates of trade books also point to the more positive view of women and minorities that trade books communicate. Unlike science texts that have been criticized for the absence or poor representation of women and minorities (Potter &amp; Rosser, 1992), trade books "view and celebrate diversity of achievement" (Daisey, 1994, p. 133). The dearth of females and people of color in science texts suggests that only cer tain people can be scientists and promotes stereotypes. Ultimately, large numbefs of fe males and minorities feel alienated from science (Daisey, 1994). The number of students in these groups who are considered science illiterate is, in fact, disproportionately large (Glynn &amp; Muth, 1994). As a result, women and minorities con tinue to be underrepresented in graduate and un dergraduate science programs and science careers (Clark, 1999; Hill, 1999; Milbourne, 1999; Rosser &amp; Kelly, 1994). Lamme and Ledbetter (as cited in Ross, 1994) provided some indication of the growing status of trade books in elementary science to day. Promoting the use of trade books over texts, they observed, "Textbooks in the content areas simply cannot match the flexibility, depth or quality provided by trade books" (p. 7). Walpole (1999) expressed an even stronger view in sug gesting that "new science text books aspire to match the trade book models" (p. 358). Using trade books in teaching elementary science: Facts and fallacies 553</page><page sequence="3">Many books; many children "Children's trade books today are often a child's first introduction to science" (Barlow, 1991, p. 166). In fact, trade books offer a solu tion to the lack of textbook support for science for young children (Stiffler, 1992). Yet, many of the benefits of using trade books in teaching sci ence are not reserved for younger children. Trade books have also been recommended for teaching science in middle and high school (Daisey, 1994; Lapp, Flood, &amp; Ranck-Buhr, 1995; Pottle, 1996). As I have indicated, more integrated ap proaches to teaching encouraged the extension of the range of trade books in the science cur riculum beyond nonfiction, such as biographies of scientists, science information books, and ac tivity books. Pottle (1996) suggested that fiction trade books on science topics are an excellent vehicle for interdisciplinary studies because they are available on such a wide variety of topics. Many others in reading and science education have advocated the use of fiction for a variety of reasons (see for example, Barrow &amp; Salesi, 1982; Butzow &amp; Butzow, 1988, 2000; Casteel &amp; Isom, 1994; Dole &amp; Johnson, 1981; Ediger, 1995; Fisher, 1980; Nordstrom, 1992; Ross, 1994; Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993; Smardo, 1982). Poetry is a genre also recommended more fre quently today for science classes (Madrazo, 1997; Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993). The growing acceptance of trade books, both fiction and nonfiction, as a resource in teaching science is very much in evidence. Teachers who have recently been involved in textbook adoptions will have noticed that in pro moting their elementary science series, many publishers are including trade books among the many products to accompany recent editions of elementary science texts. For example, Houghton Mifflin has identified over 100 trade books for use with their series, Science Discovery Works, including a wide variety of fiction, fables and tales, biographies, and science informational books. In addition, a number of popular elementary and early childhood science methods texts (see for example, Gega, 1994; Harlan &amp; Rivkin, 2000; Martin, 1997; Wolfinger, 2000) as well as resource books for teachers (Butzow &amp; Butzow, 2000; Cerullo, 1997; Fredericks, 1997) identify trade books that can be used in lessons integrating reading, lan guage arts, and science, or otherwise be incorpo rated into science lessons. Using trade books in teaching science: A theoretical perspective In recent years, changes in the philosophi cal stance of a large part of the science education community have resulted in a convergence of theoretical perspectives in science and reading. As a result, the pragmatic reasons for using trade books in science described previously are not without theoretical support from both fields. Rosenblatt's (1991) transactional view of read ing as an act in which the reader's prior experi ence, knowledge, and personality interact with the text to create meaning is in tune with many of today's teaching practices (Lynch-Brown &amp; Tomlinson, 1999). It is also in accord with the constructivist view of teaching and learning sci ence that has emerged as the predominant per spective in science education over the past 20 years. This perspective holds that learners ac tively construct their own meaning when new in formation is linked to prior knowledge (Duschl, 1990). With the widespread adoption of this in teractive constructivist view, science educators now seem more open to the potential of alterna tive teaching strategies such as using trade books (Armbruster, 1993). Examination of these theoretical underpin nings may also provide some insight into the failure of science to embrace females and people of color and, concomitantly, to suggest why ex panding reading in science may increase access to the field for these groups. Rosenblatt's (1991) theory holds that there are two stances to read ing: the efferent relating to the factual, analytical aspects of reading and the aesthetic, or emotion al, aspect of the reading process. Science, as it has traditionally been taught, has generally failed to address the aesthetic component of reading in favor of the efferent. Contemporary construc tivist views of teaching and learning science ap preciate more fully the importance of both stances. Similarly, trade books are more likely to promote both stances than are texts that tend to evoke efferent responses. Since women and mi norities tend to respond to the emotional, more relevant, more personal, and real world aspects of the nature of science (Beane, 1988; Rosser &amp; 554 The Reading Teacher Vol. 55, No. 6 March 2002</page><page sequence="4">Kelly, 1994) this increased appreciation for the aesthetic component of reading has the poten tial to help open laboratory doors to these underrepresented groups. The quality of science content in trade books: The story of Mr. Blueberry Without a doubt, trade books have much to contribute to science instruction and their inclu sion as a part of the regular science curriculum is becoming more common. However, there has been little consideration of the quality of science content in these books. An examination of the lit erature in both science and reading education finds little research on the nature of the relation ship between quality of content in trade books and the development of science concepts. A handful of studies comparing the effects of trade books and traditional texts on science achievement and atti tude toward science can be found (see for exam ple, Fisher, 1980; Lamartino, 1995; Lyttle, 1982; Maria &amp; Junge, 1993). Findings in these studies were generally inconclusive, but suggested that the children learned at least as much from trade books as they did from science texts. Mayer (1995) provided a rare look at how trade books influence the development of sci ence concepts. In a simple but revealing study, Mayer read Dear Mr. Blueberry (James, 1991), a fiction trade book about whales, to 16 children from kindergarten through third grade. After she read the book to each child, Mayer asked the child to retell the story and to answer 10 ques tions about what had been learned from the sto ry. Mayer had chosen this topic because whales are a popular subject in children's literature and this particular book in part because she felt that it described whales "fairly and adequately." In ad dition, it is a trade book intended for children "in pre-school through second grade, an age group that is a common target for teaching science with children's literature" (pp. 16-17). In the book, the character of Mr. Blueberry directly addresses and corrects misconceptions about whales in a series of letters exchanged with a little girl. Apparently, Mayer's choice of Dear Mr. Blueberry was also based on the as sumption that the direct contrast between inac curacies and correct ideas about whales would leave little room for confusion. Her findings in dicated that the children learned relatively few new facts about whales from this book. Indeed, Mayer found that several new misconceptions were unintentionally communicated to the chil dren. That whales jump from ponds to oceans and have either white or yellow bottoms were two of the "pseudofacts" children reported in in terviews. That is, the children were remembering the erroneous ideas held by the little girl instead of the correct information Mr. Blueberry was providing. Some of the children actually thought the whale was a person, perhaps a reflection of the anthropomorphic view characteristic of chil dren of this age. Mayer's (1995) findings supported the work of Jetton whose 1992 study (as cited in Maria &amp; Junge, 1993) demonstrated that second graders remembered story ideas rather than the science information even when they had been told that the purpose of reading the book was to learn more about whales. The trade book in the Jetton study combined elements of fantasy with science concepts. Mayer (1995) concluded that a number of elements in Dear Mr. Blueberry actually inter fered with the development of science concepts. Misrepresentations and illustrations in the book apparently confused some of the children. Mayer also suggested that the "children's own gender bias and understanding of animal behavior" (p. 17) were influenced negatively by the way in which the girl and the whale interacted in the story. She reported that the children she inter viewed thought that the little girl in the story looked silly. This response demonstrates how children can take away quite unexpected views of characters in trade books that are surely not the intent of the author. Unfortunately, Mayer's (1995) study is only a single example of empirical research designed to address the specific question of how chil dren's ideas in science are affected by the con tent in trade books. Obviously, one study does not provide conclusive evidence and is surely not a basis for crying "the sky is falling" with regard to trade books in the elementary science classroom. However, Mayer's work raises im portant issues. The first is a concern with accu racy of content in trade books that are used in teaching science. There is also the question of how content, whether accurate or not, affects the development of children's science concepts. Using trade books in teaching elementary science: Facts and fallacies 555</page><page sequence="5">From fireflies to fungi It was shortly after our first discussion about using trade books that my reading colleague no ticed the Mayer (1995) study cited in an article on reading in science. We found the results of Mayer's research eye-opening and her study pro vided a focal point for our own research. The first phase of our project was to carry out a content analysis of a sample of trade books addressing science concepts that are commonly found in elementary classrooms. Of the 50 books we selected, many were written by popular au thors of children's literature such as Ruth Heller, Jerry Pallotta, Eric Carle, and Tomi dePaola. Twenty-eight of the books in our sample were categorized as science trade books, 19 as fanta sy books, and three as realistic fiction (Rice &amp; Rainsford, 1996). The question guiding our re search was, "How accurate is the science content in children's trade books?" The trade books we examined communicat ed misinformation about science concepts in a variety of ways, in text as well as in drawings and artwork. This finding supported Mayer's (1995) suggestion that misrepresentations in both text and illustrations confused some chil dren. We also discovered that while many errors in content are explicit, some of the misinforma tion is more implicit or may be inferred from text and illustrations. A detailed description of the numerous ex amples of misinformation we identified in the sample of 50 books is beyond the scope of this discussion. A few examples of what we found in clude seeds fly high enough to be burned up by the sun {The Tiny Seed, Carle, 1987), fireflies dance around the moon {The Grouchy Ladybug, Carle, 1996), and crocodiles can walk on two legs {Cornelius, Lionni, 1983). In The Quicksand Book (dePaola, 1977), the drawings depict jungle scenes with children dressed like Tarzan and Jane, implying that quicksand is found only in jungles?which is not true. Slugs, snail-like creatures, are identified as "bugs" in Bugs (Parker &amp; Wright, 1987). "Bug" is actual ly a term reserved for a specific group of insects and is not an appropriate name for slugs, which are members of the mollusk group of animals. In The Mixed Up Chameleon (Carle, 1975), A Color of His Own (Lionni, 1975), and The Yucky Reptile Alphabet Book (Pallotta, 1989), the chameleon, a reptile whose skin changes col or in response to environmental conditions, is shown changing to hues such as bright red, yel low, or white. Chameleons are limited in the col ors to which they can change, generally from shades of green or yellowish-green to shades of brown. Even the more brightly colored chameleons cannot change to bright red, yellow, blue, or white, just because the environment around them is one of these colors. A similar bit of exaggeration is found in How to Hide a Butterfly (Heller, 1992) where, as an example of camouflage, a spider is shown changing "to yel low and then to pink or white, depending on the flower that she decides is right." Carle's "mixed up chameleon" is, in fact, shown in a more natural green on the last page of that particular book. However, as Mayer's (1995) study clearly demonstrated, when both inaccuracies and science facts are presented in the same book, children do not necessarily re member the correct information. The first time I read one of these books, the misinformation communicated about chameleons hit home for me as an elementary science meth ods teacher. In my university classes, both under graduate and graduate, more than one student has responded in surprise when I've pointed out that chameleons, at least those native to our area, don't turn scarlet or bright blue! Using words such as "icky" {The Icky Bug Alphabet Book, Pallotta, 1986) and "yucky" {The Yucky Reptile Alphabet Book, Pallotta, 1989) reinforces negative stereotypes of science as a messy, smelly, repulsive experience. Such images, often communicated by parents and teachers, encourage negative attitudes toward science. These attitudes affect all children, but particularly reinforce cultural stereotypes that discourage girls' development of greater inter est in science (Ballou, 1986). Another example of how subtle stereotypi cal images may be communicated is found in the following passage from The Ocean Alphabet Book (Pallotta, 1986): "E is for eel. Eels are slimy. Eels are long and thin like snakes. If you do not like to hold snakes, then you probably would not like to hold eels." This analogy rein forces the common misconception that snakes are slimy, when they are actually dry and cool to the touch. 556 The Reading Teacher Vol. 55, No. 6 March 2002</page><page sequence="6">A glaring error is found in the popular chil dren's trade book, The Reason for a Flower (Heller, 1983). In the closing pages of the book, a picture of a mushroom is accompanied by the statement, "Plants that have no flowers are fasci nating, too." For me, a former life science teacher, this reference is particularly disconcert ing. Fungi were reclassified decades ago and placed in a different kingdom. Mushrooms, which are examples of fungi, are not plants. What science are children learning from trade books? It was clear from our research that many of the trade books that teachers might select for sci ence classes contained questionable content. Next, we followed Mayer's (1995) lead and ex plored what scientific information, or misinfor mation, children take away from trade books. Like Mayer, we chose whales as our topic be cause of the popularity of whales with elemen tary children and the availability of trade books on the subject. We identified 10 books on whales common ly found in elementary media centers. Content analysis of these books revealed a number of sci entific inaccuracies or misconceptions. In order to focus on a smaller and more manageable number of concepts, we narrowed the sample to five books. We then developed a set of five or six true or false questions for each story. Each set of questions included at least two questions re lated to errors in content that we had identified. Two classes of second graders and one fourth-grade class participated in our study (Rice &amp; Rainsford, 1997; Rice &amp; Snipes, 1997). To the second graders, we read Whale Song (Johnston, 1987), The Whales (Rylant, 1996), Dear Mr. Blueberry (James, 1991), / Wonder If I'll See a Whale (Weiler, 1991), and the chapter, "The Three Gray Whales" in Animals Who Have Won Our Hearts (George, 1994). We read the fourth graders Whale Song, The Whales, and Dear Mr. Blueberry. Answer sheets required the children to sim ply circle "yes" or "no" in response to each ques tion. For the younger children, "smiley" or "frowning" faces were used on the answer sheets. Regardless of grade level, the questions were read aloud to the children to reduce the impact of differences in reading level. Unlike Mayer (1995) who questioned the children about the content of Dear Mr. Blueberry only after she read them the book, we asked the children the same set of questions before and again after we read the book. These procedures allowed us to explore children's prior knowledge and to pinpoint spe cific changes in children's science concepts as a result of exposure to the trade book content. We assessed the children's prior knowledge by counting the number of correct responses on the pretests. Pretests based on the five stories read to the second graders resulted in an overall score of 58% correct. Fourth graders scored an average of 76% correct on the pretests on the three stories read to them (Rice &amp; Snipes, 1997). It was apparent that the children had some prior knowledge about whales and their behavior. We next characterized changes that the chil dren made in their answers from pretest to posttest. If a change resulted in the correct an swer on the posttest, we identified that change as a "correct" change. Likewise, a change from a correct to an incorrect answer on the posttest was labeled "incorrect." An analysis of the chil dren's answers revealed that for the majority of the questions, children did not change their an swers from pretest to posttest. When they did change answers, however, the posttest answers very closely mirrored the information in the book that had been read to them, whether the in formation in the book was correct or not. Two examples illustrate what we observed. One of the questions we developed for The Whales (Rylant, 1996) was, "Do whales have a sense of smell?" The correct answer was "no." The science content in The Whales clearly indi cates this: "But a rose is lost on them, for they haven't any sense of smell." (In whales, areas of the brain for olfaction are greatly reduced, or more often nonexistent, indicative of the lack of a sense of smell. Though not demonstrated it is possible that baleen whales, which eat plankton, have some sense of smell [see Fontaine, 1998].) On the pretest, about half of the children in both second and fourth grades got this question wrong, answering "yes." With the exception of one child, all of the children who had answered incorrectly on the pretest changed their answers on the posttest. This "correction" of the chil dren's ideas was clearly based on information in The Whales. Using trade books in teaching elementary science: Facts and fallacies 557</page><page sequence="7">We also found that children changed an swers to reflect incorrect information (Rice &amp; Snipes, 1997). For Whale Song (Johnston, 1987), we asked the question, "Do whale babies (calves) sleep?" The correct answer is "yes" (see Payne, 1995). However, Whale Song contains the following statement: "Softly she sings, six, six, six. But does her calf sleep? No! He just laughs and sings seven!" (Emphasis added.) It is easy to see how children might infer that baby whales do not sleep. Nineteen of the second graders gave the correct answer, "yes" on the pretest, but on the posttest this number dropped to nine. Fourth graders responded similarly to the reading of Whale Song with 13 of 25 students changing their posttest answers to "no." These responses indicated that the children apparently took the book quite literally and based their "in correct" posttest answers on the book's content. These examples reflect a trend that we ob served with both second and fourth graders in the study. If children changed their answers, their posttest answers generally reflected the in formation in the book, whether it was accurate or not. As others have reported (see for example, Lamartino, 1995; Mayer, 1995), children can and do learn science from trade books. But, not surprisingly, children cannot always discrimi nate between accurate and inaccurate science content. As Mayer warned, what children learn from trade books is not always "science con cepts, but...science misconceptions" (p. 43). Misconceptions and trade books Misconceptions are alternately referred to in science education literature as na?ve concep tions, preconceptions, alternative conceptions, or children's science. These ideas, held by both children and adults, are science concepts that are "at variance with current scientific knowledge" (Wandersee, Mintzes, &amp; Novak, 1994, p. 179). There is a large body of evidence indicating that misconceptions may inadvertently be introduced by textbooks or teachers (Cho, Kahle, &amp; Nordland, 1985; Gauld, 1997; lona, 1989,1994; Wandersee et al., 1994). Miller, Steiner, and Larson (1996) pointed out that without the ac companiment of correct scientific explanations, children's literature and storytelling can also lead to misconceptions. Compounding the prob lem, a vast body of research on misconceptions indicates that erroneous ideas can be very tena cious and resistant to extinction (see for exam ple, Miller et al., 1996; Shymansky, Yore, &amp; Good, 1991; Wandersee et al., 1994) and inter fere with subsequent learning in science (see for example, Holiday, Yore, &amp; Alvermann, 1994; Wandersee et al., 1994). Many assume that the science misconcep tions that children develop in the early years will be tested and corrected as children mature, have more life experiences, and complete higher level science courses in middle and high school (Johnston, 1991). However, the research in sci ence education suggests just the opposite, that we cannot assume that children's ideas in sci ence will become more sophisticated (Duschl, 1990). In fact, periodic surveys of randomly se lected American adults over the past 20 years have shown that many adults retain naive and er roneous ideas in science. Over the past decade, the results of the national "Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology" (National Science Board, 2000) have been very consistent in demonstrat ing that Americans are "illiterate in science" ("Poll finds," 1988, p. A3). For example, on the past three surveys, only 45-47% of those sur veyed knew that it takes the Earth one year to go around the sun, instead of one day or one month. This response pattern persists into adult hood despite the fact that Earth, sun, moon inter relationships are typically introduced in the early elementary years and are usually addressed again in middle school earth science. Only about half of the 1999 respondents cor rectly responded "false" to the statement, "the earliest human beings lived at the same time as the dinosaurs" (National Science Board, 2000). Dinosaurs, in fact, predated early humans by more than 60 million years. Misinformation about the coexistence of dinosaurs and humans is introduced and perpetuated in children's books, television, movies, and, in some cases, through religious teachings. Apparently this is another misconception that wasn't corrected through science classes, at least not for the 50% or so of the adult respondents who answered "true" to this statement. The underlying problem is that erroneous ideas may be retained or interact with new in formation to produce unintended or unanticipat ed learning outcomes. In fact, attempts to link new information to incorrect ideas to build 558 The Reading Teacher Vol. 55, No. 6 March 2002</page><page sequence="8">meaning may simply result in failure (Duschl, 1990), that is, a complete lack of understanding. It stands to reason that the introduction of inac curate information, whatever the source, should be avoided if possible. Our research suggests that by adding trade books containing inaccura cies to the science curriculum, we risk com pounding these problems. For this reason, it is imperative that teachers exercise caution in se lecting trade books, either as a substitute for or complement to the science text. Accuracy: A high priority The problems created by presenting inaccu rate content perhaps have greater implications in science than in any other subject. Because sci ence has historically been taught in an authori tarian manner, it is not unusual to find that students assume that information must be cor rect simply because they heard it in science class. In this context, children are at greater risk of accepting incorrect information whatever the source?whether from the teacher, science texts, or trade books. Cullinan (1981) underscored this problem as it relates to text books, "Children do not question what they read when they are given one text book, which is held up as embodying the final and whole truth on the subject" (p. 385). The ex pectation that science content will always be ac curate and realistic is reflected in the words of John Burroughs, a proponent of scientific accu racy in books about nature: It is always an artist's privilege to heighten or deepen natural effects. He may paint us a more beautiful woman, or a more beautiful horse, or a more beautiful landscape, than we ever saw; we are not deceived even though he out-does nature. We know where we stand and where he stands; we know that this is the power of art. But when he paints a portrait, or an actual scene, or event, we expect him to be true to the facts of the case, (cited in Eggerton, 1996, p. 21) On numerous occasions, I have observed how students, both children and adults, assume that science content is accurate by virtue of the fact that they heard it in "science" class. For example, in my elementary science methods courses, I in troduce the use of trade books by reading The Whales by Cynthia Rylant (1996). I give my col lege students the same pretest and posttest that we developed for elementary children in our study of trade books. Invariably a few students change some of their answers based on the book content, just as the second and fourth graders did. These same students then protest that they changed their answers only because they trusted that I would never read them something that was incorrect. Somewhat embarrassed, they lament, "But you're the science teacher! We never thought you would read us something that wasn't correct." Using trade books in teaching science: A reasonable option Historically, elementary teachers have felt underprepared in science and science education and have been uncomfortable teaching science (see for example, Pratt, 1981; Ramey-Gassert &amp; Shroyer, 1992; Royce &amp; Wiley, 1996). The re quirement for preservice elementary teachers' preparation in science is typically limited to "no more than two science courses" (Bethel, as cit ed in Royce and Wiley, 1996, p. 18). Two, or even three courses, are a bare minimum given the range of topics in the elementary science cur riculum. While many elementary teachers view science as important, they do not necessarily see science instruction as important at the elemen tary level (Butzow &amp; Butzow, 1989). In contrast, reading and reading instruction are of prime importance and elementary teachers generally feel more comfortable with children's literature than with science texts (Butzow &amp; Butzow, 1989). For these teachers, using trade books in teaching science would seem to be a reasonable option (Royce &amp; Wiley, 1996). Unfortunately, there is evidence that many ele mentary teachers may not be discriminating in selecting trade books for use in science (Baker &amp; Saul, 1994). Simon (1982) reported that when a particular science topic was studied, all of the books in the school library on that topic were "promptly taken from the shelves and signed out" (p. 5), a practice that is still in evidence to day. Sudol and King (1996) pointed out that teachers often do not take time (or, I might add, have time) to think about the accuracy of content in books they choose. Apparently, these teach ers just assume that the information is correct and fail to consider that they may be teaching "misinformation." In light of the large body of research on misconceptions and the recent re search on trade books, such actions must be viewed as significant errors in judgment.

Mayer (1995) voiced the opinion that teachers must be able to recognize weaknesses in trade books and be pre pared to deal with them. Others have suggested that, at the very least, they need to be cognizant of the possibility of inaccuracies in trade books (Royce &amp; Wiley, 1996). Fortunately, there are a number of resources available to assist teachers in their selection of high-quality trade books for their science classes. Tips on selecting trade books for teaching science have, in fact, been available in the sci ence education literature for quite some time (see for example, Blough, 1973; Janke &amp; Norton, 1983; Simon, 1982). More recently, a number of authors from both the reading and sci ence education communities have published guidelines for evaluating trade books, which ele mentary teachers may find helpful (Butzow &amp; Butzow, 2000; Mayer, 1995; Pottle, 1996; Sudol &amp; King, 1996). These sets of guidelines vary somewhat in their foci and goals, but all of them propose accuracy as an important criterion. Busy education professionals may use any of these sets of guidelines with confidence to quickly and efficiently select trade books for teaching sei ence. Table 1 provides a comparative summary of these four sets of guidelines. Elementary teachers may also refer to vari ous reviews for assistance in identifying trade books for their science teaching. These re sources, like the guidelines described in Table 1, place strong emphasis on content accuracy. Reviewers also consider how current books are, and look for evidence of cultural, gender, and racial biases. Some of the reviews include infor mation about illustrations, organization, and consistency. Media specialists will be familiar with most of these resources, examples of which are found in Table 2. Science and Children is perhaps the most accessible to elementary teach ers as it is commonly found in libraries and is written with them in mind. Membership in the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) affords teachers a choice of several publications including Science and Children. Appraisal: Science Books for Young People also bears spe cial mention because it is somewhat unique in that each book is reviewed by two individuals, a children's media specialist and a subject area specialist (Holzheimer, 1991). Many resources are also available to help teachers in expanding their science content knowledge, a step that will contribute to better science teaching in a number of ways. For ex ample, the ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Education (CSMEE) recently published an extensive list of adult-oriented informational trade books that provide reliable content information on a wide 560 The Reading Teacher Vol. 55, No. 6 March 2002</page><page sequence="10">Table 2 Examples of publications that review trade books for use in teaching science Publication name Publisher Publication schedule Appraisal: Science Books for Young People Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books Science and Children?

Using trade books in teaching science: Some suggestions Today science and reading educators, class room teachers, and children's authors are sharing creative ways to use trade books in teaching sci ence. Elementary teachers may access this infor mation by attending presentations at science and reading professional organization meetings, by reading popular publications and professional journals, and by exploring the Internet. While it is beyond the scope of this article to provide an in-depth discussion of the many potential uses of trade books, mention of a few examples will pro vide a sense of the range of possibilities. While some educators feel that hands-on science leaves no room for science reading, there are, in fact, a number of strategies for teaching science that combine the strengths of reading and activity-based science instruction. Casteel and Isom (1994), for example, described a number of ways fiction and nonfiction trade books may be incorporated into thematic units that require students to exercise literacy skills such as predicting and organizing while engag ing in science activities that require science process skills such as hypothesizing, gathering and organizing data, and drawing conclusions. They suggested that focusing on the literacy as pects of science instruction reduces many of the factors contributing to children's dislike of sci ence and, thus, helps children learn science while they become more proficient in reading and communication skills. The learning cycle is another strategy that integrates literature and science (for details, see Barman, 1992; Marek &amp; Cavallo, 1997). The first and last of the three stages in the learning cycle engage children in hands-on experiences, creating an initial concrete context for introduc tion of new science concepts and an opportunity at the end of the lesson to demonstrate under standing, obtain clarification, and reinforce these same concepts. Sandwiched between these two stages is the term introduction, consisting of ac tivities that have traditionally constituted the en tire science lesson, such as reading the text, watching videos, and defining terms. Trade books and other types of children's literature are very appropriate for the term introduction stage as are textbooks, films, and other resources. Miller et al. (1996) described another strat egy that uses children's literature and hands-on experiences, in this case to directly address mis conceptions. Introducing lessons with What I Know-What I Want to Know-What I Learned (KWL) charts, the teacher identifies a miscon ception held by the children, followed by a demonstration that contradicts this invalid idea. A variety of related children's literature, exam ples of real-life connections, or applications of the science concept are then combined with a Using trade books in teaching elementary science: Facts and fallacies 561</page><page sequence="11">number of hands-on activities to facilitate chil dren's shifts toward more valid scientific ideas. Others have described various strategies that use trade books to engage children in inquiry ac tivities. For teachers who desire a more struc tured approach similar to that afforded by textbooks, Crook and Lehman (1990) recom mended using a five-phase direct instruction model that uses nonfiction trade books to engage children in clearly defined, purposeful research activities. Taking a different tack, Short and Armstrong (1993) described an inquiry cycle ap proach that brings together fiction and nonfiction literature with observation centers and displays. In their view, literature should support "the 'do ing' of science, not take the place of observation and experimentation" (Short &amp; Armstrong, p. 185). One of the important components of this second strategy is paired reading of trade books. Another technique that has the potential to enhance the use of trade books (as well as science texts) in teaching science is Questioning the Author, or QtA (for a detailed discussion, see Beck, McKeown, Hamilton, &amp; Kucan, 1997). Initially used with social studies texts, this strat egy is appropriate for expository texts or for nar rative texts including fictional stories, novels, and fables. Rather than using the typical questioning pattern that assesses comprehension after reading and formulation of ideas, QtA assists students in comprehending while they are reading. With QtA, the teacher uses "queries" to stimulate dis cussion, to uncover misconceptions, and to en courage collaborative construction of meaning as the children read. A strength of QtA for the sci ence classroom, as I see it, is that it has the po tential to reduce the authoritarian manner in which science has traditionally been presented by encouraging, actually requiring, children to ques tion what the author is trying to say and why. Strategies for using trade books in science lessons generally presume that the content is ac curate, however, as we have seen, this is not al ways the case. McMillan (1993), himself an author of children's nonfiction science trade books, points out that even nonfiction books containing misinformation sometimes make their way to bookstore shelves despite thorough review. He stresses that authors must guard against not only misstatements in their books, but also errors of omission. Fortunately, trade books that contain errors or that leave open the possibility of misinterpre tation can be used effectively in teaching sci ence. Errors, whether identified by the teacher or the children, can be used to help children learn to question the accuracy of what they read by com paring their own observations and the informa tion in their texts to the science presented in trade books (Martin, 1997). Children can also read several sources on a given topic (Nordstrom, 1992; Ross, 1994; Short &amp; Armstrong, 1993; Simon, 1982). As Blough (1973) pointed out, it's almost a given that chil dren will find contradictions or disagreements if they read multiple sources. Based on multiple readings, they can make comparisons, verify facts, and note inconsistencies and errors. Students may also be taught to evaluate qualifying statements such as "evidence seems to indicate" or "some scientists say" (Blough, 1973, p. 22) and to analyze the content in trade books to determine whether the author has in cluded all of the necessary supporting informa tion, whether the facts fit together logically, and whether the information is up to date (Casteel &amp; Isom, 1994). In pursuing such questions, chil dren can engage in research that facilitates the development of skills necessary for becoming better, more critical readers and better con sumers of scientific information. In addition, the preparation of reports and communication of findings so basic to science can become oppor tunities to develop both writing and verbal skills. Teachers should also feel free to use parts of books, omitting sections that are inaccurate, out of date, or otherwise problematic. For ex ample, using Heller's The Reason for a Flower (1983) can contribute much to a lesson on flow ers, z/the teacher stops short of that last page in dicating that mushrooms are plants. One final thought on using trade books in el ementary science can be attributed to my under graduate elementary science methods students, who complete research projects on using trade books in science. Several of them reported that children with whom they worked in their field placements who were already familiar with a concept seemed to be more critical of what was read to them than were the students for whom the concept was relatively new. It appeared that a "little bit of knowledge" encouraged children's questioning and discouraged their acceptance of 562 The Reading Teacher Vol. 55, No. 6 March 2002</page><page sequence="12">what the "science" teacher had read as "fact." My students concluded that quality of content is not the only issue to be considered when select ing and using trade books, but that when trade books are used is perhaps as important. Although teachers often read a trade book at the beginning of a lesson to provide a context, arouse curiosi ty, or raise questions (Martin, 1997), my students expressed the opinion that, in many instances, trade books might be better suited for later in the lesson or unit, rather than earlier. Use good science trade books in your classroom Earlier in this article, I raised several ques tions about the appropriate role of trade books in teaching science. A review of the reading and science education literature clearly demonstrates both pragmatic and theoretical support for their use in the elementary science classroom and sug gests a wide range of strategies for their integra tion into the science curriculum. However, recent research has demonstrated that children learn not only "good science" from trade books, but also encounter errors in their reading. Therein lies the basic problem. Science content in trade books cannot always be trusted to be ac curate, particularly given that most authors of children's books, even nonfiction science trade books, lack science credentials (McMillan, 1993). Errors of omission, incomplete state ments, value statements, outdated information, and lack of detail create problems just as overt ly erroneous information does. As a result, teachers should exercise caution in selecting trade books for their science class % es, not simply default to trade books just because they and their students might be more comfort able with this form of literature than with science texts. Trade books should supplement, not sup plant quality science texts; they should be picked with care, not swept en masse from the library shelf. Teachers must have a clear idea of their objectives and the specifics of how a particular trade book will be used in instruction. Today, ed ucators in both science and reading are making identification of quality trade books?and there are many?easier by providing critiques, recom mendations, and guidelines for evaluating trade books for teaching science. Teachers who don't feel confident about their science backgrounds will find these resources particularly helpful. It is only fair to note that fault does not nec essarily lie with trade books or their authors. Many of the books being used in elementary and middle school science classes today, especially fiction trade books, were not written with the in tent that they would become part of the science curriculum. As Mayer (1995) noted, "a book might be an excellent example of children's lit erature, but at the same time, a poor resource for learning science" (p. 18). Despite the problems, the potential of trade books to enhance the science curriculum and to invigorate science in struction is significant and limited only by our imaginations. In her poem, "Half Moonshine," Judith Viorst (1995) aptly captured the challenge facing ele mentary teachers in choosing trade books for sci ence. In a clever series of comparisons, Viorst contrasts myths or misconceptions with accurate scientific facts about the moon, labeling each statement as either "moonshine" or "true" (p. 22). The ability of teachers to identify both the short comings and strengths of trade books and to rec ognize whether students are being presented scientific fallacies or facts?moonshine or truth? is critical to the effective use of this valuable re source in the elementary science classroom.
