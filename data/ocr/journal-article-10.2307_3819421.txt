<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC Obiajuru Maduakor The substance of Soyinka's achievement as a literary critic is revealed in Myth, Literature, and the African World (1976), which contains his most important literary essays. The title itself is suggestive of Soyinka's major critical preoccupation: he is fascinated with myth as a phenomenon that exercises an unlimited appeal for the human imagination, manifesting itself in the literature, culture, folklore, and world view of a people. Because he also is a manipulator of myth in his role as a creative writer, his critical statements on works in the mythic mode are bound to throw some light on his own writings. What is myth? An answer to this question is not directly pro? vided in Soyinka's critical utterances on myth and literature, but we can infer it from his writing as connoting a people's world view and the moral system that sustains that world view as it is reflected in'their stories of the origin of the world, of gods and of man. Among his own people, the Yoruba, this view of myth is reinforced by the Coleridgean sense of the one-life theory which binds man to the gods and to nature in the interest of the psychic well-being of the universe. But there is a more pertinent definition from Clar? ence Hugh Holman et al., who distinguish between the traditional</page><page sequence="2">2 Obiajuru Maduakor definition of myth and the modernist extension of this definition. In the traditional sense of the word, myths are anonymous stories having their roots in the primitive folk be? liefs of races or nations and presenting supernatural episodes as a means of interpreting natural events in an effort to make concrete and particular a special perception of man or a cos- In the modernist redefinition ofthe word, myth is seen as contain- ing vestiges of primordial ritual and ceremony, or the repository of racial memories, or a structure of unconsciously held value systems, or an expression of the general beliefs of a race, social class or nation or a unique embodiment of a cosmic The two definitions are relevant to Soyinka's use of the term myth both in his creative works and in his literary essays. His literary essays touch naturally upon other areas of general interest in lit? erary criticism; for example, the question of authenticity in charac? ter conception and presentation, and of probability in the execution of plot in the criticism of fiction. But he is by natural disposition a myth critic. His later excursions into a sociological analysis of works of literature is the direct outcome of the ideological contro- versy between him and his Marxist critics. For convenience, I shall consider Soyinka's literary essays under four subheadings: Incidental Essays (1960-66), Ritual Essays (1976), Essays on Ideology and Social Vision (1976), and Controversies (1975-80). The early essays referred to as Incidental Essays are not reproduced in their original format in Myth, Literature, and the African World, but the substance of their arguments is worked into the extended framework of the essay on literature and the social vision with little or no modification of Soyinka's original impressions on the works concerned. But I discuss them here sep? arately in recognition of their merits as literary essays and also to cover other issues of critical interest that might have been left out in Soyinka's summary of their contents in the third and fourth chapters of Myth and Literature. Soyinka's literary essays are, to some extent, one essay. His criti? cal prejudices were formed quite early in his career as a writer and a critic. Both the early and later essays are crisscrossed by related</page><page sequence="3">3 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC threads of thought. The war on negritude rages on still, even though the first shots were fired in the 1960s. Apart from his ob- jection to negritude on the basis of its addiction to self-glorifying narcissism, I detect in Soyinka's opposition to that movement the beginnings of his later aversion to literary ideology in general. It is a mark of Soyinka's maturity as a critic that he maintains a con? sist ency of opinion in his evaluation of works of literature. That implies that his views are considered carefully before they are of? fered to the public. Incidental Essays Three essays that will be discussed in this section are "The Future of African Writing" (1960), "From a Common Back Cloth" (1963), and "And after the Narcissist?" (1966). The first essay, possibly written during Soyinka's student days at Leeds, was pubiished in the University of Ibadan poetry magazine, The Horn, founded by J. P. Clark and Martin Banham. Since this essay is not easily accessible, I reproduce Bernth Lindfors's summary of Soyinka's main argument. According to Lindfors, Soyinka argues that the real mark of authenticity in African writing was indiffer- ent self-acceptance rather than energetic racial self-assertion. Early African writing . . . was dishonest because it either imitated literary fashions in Europe or pandered to European demands and expectations for the exotic and primitive. The first West African writer to produce truly African Literature was not Leopold Senghor but Chinua Achebe.3 Here is part of the essay as it appears in Lindfors's study and in an article written by Martin Banham, who indeed may have been the first critic to notice Soyinka's early attempt at literary criticism: The significance of Chinua Achebe is the evolvement, in West African writing, of the seemingly indifferent acceptance. And this, I believe, is the turning point in our literary de? velopment. It is also a fortunate accident of timing, because ofthe inherently invalid doctrine of "negritude." Leopold Senghor, to name a blatant example. And if we would speak of "negritude" in a more acceptable broader sense, Chinua Achebe is a more "African" writer than Senghor. The duiker will not paint "duiker" on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude; you'11 know him by his elegant leap. The less</page><page sequence="4">4 Obiajuru Maduakor self-conscious the African is, and the more innately his in? dividual qualities appear in his writing, the more seriously he will be taken as an artist of exciting dignity. . . . Senghor seems to be so artistically expatriate . . . [and he and poets like him] are a definite retrogressive pseudo-romantic influ? ence on a healthy development of West African writing.4 Soyinka is rather hard on Senghor and negritude in this essay; his own writings are equally guilty of some of the charges he levels at Senghor. His novel The Interpreters appears to have been in? fluenced by James Joyce, and his poetry reflects the "toughness" of such neometaphysical poets as Eliot and Pound. But Soyinka is no less an African poet because of his response to these Western influences. The quip on duiker and duikeritude graduated into the celebrated adage about tiger and tigritude at the African Writers' Conference at Kampala (Uganda) in 1962. On the whole, Soyinka is objective in his assessment of works by African writers. The same Achebe who is praised for his "Africanness" in "The Future of African Writing" is gently reprimanded in "From a Common Back Cloth" for succumbing to a slight touch of improbability in the resolution of the plot in his first novel, Things Fail Apart (1958). The accidental explosion of Okonkwo's gun, contributing as it does to the novel's ultimate tragic denouement, is, in Soyinka's view, a narrative expedience rather than an organically integrated episode. On the other hand, Achebe is praised for anticipating in the novel some aspects of the traditional African philosophy which Soyinka will regard later as vital elements of the African world view. This Achebe did in his allusion to the mysterious relationship between a man and his chi, to the mysteries of initiation, to guilt and purifi- cation whose ethics, says Soyinka, "are not those ofa court of law but of the forces of Nature cycle, of the living and the dead." The logic of this phenomenon is the "philosophy of acceptance. Not blind, slavish acceptance but a positive faith, an acceptance of forces that begin where the physical leaves off."5 "From a Common Back Cloth" is an assessment of the African literary image in the novels of the 1950s and of the treatment in those novels of a common theme that preoccupies them; that is, the encounter between tradition and change. Soyinka labels both of these considerations the "common back cloth." In the hands of lesser writers such as Onuora Nzekwu, the "back cloth" breeds sociological novels. With such writers as Alan Paton, Peter Abra? hams, and William Conton, the "back cloth" gives birth to dumb and wooden, servile character-types masquerading as human beings.</page><page sequence="5">5 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC African characters in the works of these writers lack human attri? butes because they were not conceived from within, that is, from the "dignity and authority of self-acceptance."6 Their portraiture is dictated largely by Western stereotypical prejudices originating from what Soyinka calls "an outrageously imposed Christian for? giveness."7 It is only in the works of such writers as Chinua Ache? be, Mongo Beti, and the South African novelist, Alex La Guma, that the African characters appear as fully individuated human beings. Mongo Beti achieved this rounded portraiture in his pre? sentation of his Africans by seeing them in the first place as in? dividuals composed like every other human being of cunning and compassion. His is not the negritudinist, one-dimensional mode of characterization, but a rounded view of both the African and his traditional society. "Hospitality is not, as we are constantly roman- tically informed that it is, nearly so spontaneous. There is a mer- cenary edge, and this, alas, is not always traceable to that alien corrupt civilization!"8 Paton, Abrahams, Conton, and negritude will appear later in the essay on ideology and the social vision where they will serve to buttress Soyinka's arguments against literary ideology. An important writer mentioned in the present essay is Amos Tutuola, whose "back cloth" is a shade different from those of his contemporaries in the writing trade. Soyinka finds Tutuola to be more original than his fellow African writer-intellectuals because his imagination is constantly amalgamating new experiences and fusing them into new syntheses. The atom bomb and the magical egg of plenty find a place in his world. The difference between him and his modern manipulators ofthe "back cloth" is such as can exist between a natural imagination and an intellectual imagi? nation. Tutuola is "a storyteller in the best Yoruba tradition, pushing the bounds of credibility higher and higher and sustaining it by sheer adroitness, by a juxtaposition of analogous experience from the familiar."9 He is best understood as "the contemporary imagination in a story-telling tradition."10 In the third essay ("And after the Narcissist?"), Soyinka insists that the supreme narcissist in African writing is Leopold Senghor. Narcissism is synonymous with the literature of self-worship or of self-hypnosis, one in which the self is "most clamant in its own adulation."11 Too much concentration of emphasis on the self breeds stasis or absence of action. Thus, stasis becomes an extension of the meaning of narcissism. And this is where writers such as Achebe of Arrow of God (1964) and Gabriel Okara of The Voice (1964) qualify as narcissists. In these works there is movement which</page><page sequence="6">6 Obiajuru Maduakor is not translated into action. Ezeulu neither dares nor ventures forth, just like Okolo, the hero of Okara's novel. There is no com? munication in the latter "of the psychic drive which sets a man on ?a course of single-minded enquiry into the heart of matter or ex? istence."12 Okolo's passivity contrasts with the questioning and the daring insistence of Soyinka's own quest-hero Ofeyi, equally en? gaged, like Okolo, in an inquiry into the heart of matter or ex? istence. The psychic unease that impels Ofeyi is frequently the subject of Ofeyi's reflection. Ofeyi is often caught up in throes of introspective reminiscences and self-doubt. Soyinka distinguishes between narcissism and self-exploration. Self-exploration is the burden ofthe tragic/subjective artist, the soul's descent into its own world of interior which, as Hegel says in a different context, has been urged upon the artist by "a severance of mind from world, soul from circumstance, and human inward- ness from external conditions,"13 whereas narcissism is self-manipu- lation. Soyinka's metaphor for it is the fascination for the womb, where no distraction exists and where no opportunity tempts to action. But the true poet is one who ventures forth, who confronts experience, who realizes that hot sterilizing pads sealed the cord at birth but that such dis- couraging facts need not condemn the poet to exile. And so exploration begins from the acceptance; the poet rejects the navel's fascination, seeks his path through experience, through liberation, through self-surrender.14 The work that best illustrates Senghor's narcissistic indulgence, insofar as narcissism is synonymous with inaction, is Senghor's dramatic poem, Chaka. Chaka, the legendary man of action, is rendered effete and effeminate in the poem; and this, says So? yinka, is due to Senghor's misapprehension of the proper functions of poetry. The sentimental reduction of Chaka's will for action into a narcissistic passivity implies that, for Senghor, "poetry is not in itself a force for violence or an occasional instrument of terror";15 whereas, for Soyinka, "every creative act breeds and destroys fear, contains within itself both the salvation and the damnation."16 We are approaching here the delicate grounds of aesthetics, the Soyinka aesthetic which sets the artist as the destroyer and the preserver. It was the Irish dramatist, John Millington Synge, who articulated the cardinal ideology of this aesthetic as the mingling of beauty with brutality. Synge is reported to have warned Yeats that before poetry could be human (beautiful) it must learn to be brutal.</page><page sequence="7">7 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC The combination of beauty with ugliness in Yeats's later verse which is so different from the ideal fantasy world of his early verse is a new development credited to Yeats's encounter with Synge. Perhaps Senghor needed to have heeded Synge's advice to Yeats to render Chaka more masculine and energetic in his poem. What we have in Senghor's poem is sentimental affirmations and the nega- tivity of escapism rather than a vigorous tragic resolution of con? flicts through the will for action. Soyinka returns to this same theme of passive acceptance rather than of tragic engagement which is inherent in negritude in the essay "The Fourth Stage." "The principle of creativity," writes Soyinka, "when limited to pastoral idyllism, as negritude has at? tempted to limit it, shuts us off from the deeper, fundamental reso- lutions of experience and cognition."17 For a more authentic approach to Chaka, Soyinka offers Senghor the example of his god, Ogun, who embodies the right attitude towards the creative principle: In explication of the real problem of Senghor in the interpre? tation of Chaka, which cannot be solved by the poetic self- identification, the essence of Ogun, the Yoruba god of war and the creative principle, probably offers the best assistance. . . . Primogenitor of the artist as the creative human, Ogun is the antithesis of cowardice and Philistinism, yet within him is contained also the complement of the creative essence, a bloodthirsty destructiveness. Mixed up with the gestative in- hibition of his nature [is] the destructive explosion of an in- calculable energy.18 As a corrective measure to Senghor's dull rendition of the Chaka legend, Soyinka has himself embodied the myths of Ogun and Chaka in two epic poems distinguished by their conscious cultiva- tion of the aesthetics of action. Ritual Essays The core of the ritual essays is Soyinka's attempt in "The Fourth Stage" to define the origin and meaning of the tragic myth in the context of the Yoruba world view. This essay was written in honor of Professor G. Wilson Knight, who was Soyinka's teacher at Leeds.19 Knight, an eminent Shakespearean scholar and a critic in the ritual mode, influenced Soyinka significantly in his understanding of myth and ritual. "The Fourth Stage" is Soyinka's first pronounce- ment on what he later calls "morality and aesthetics in the ritual</page><page sequence="8">8 Obiajuru Maduakor archetypes" and on the role of drama in the African world view. The other two essays whose titles correspond with the foregoing expressions ("Morality and Aesthetics in the Ritual Archetype" and "Drama and the African World View") merely enlarge upon the issues that have been raised in "The Fourth Stage." "The Fourth Stage" helped to establish Soyinka's reputation as a myth critic, a drama theorist, and a master of language. The citation conferring upon Soyinka the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Yale University acknowledges these attributes: "Poet and playwright in a language metaphorical and lyrical, you have re- defined modern tragedy through a synthesis of Yoruba and West? ern tragic forms."20 Like Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy which inspired it, "The Fourth Stage" was written in a youthful spirit. Its language is explosive, lyrical, and emotional. What approxi- mates to the essay in verbal intensity is charged moments in So? yinka's prison memoirs, The Man Died(chap. 12). In his later literary essays Soyinka's language has grown more sober, more con- trolled, and less mythopoeic. "The Fourth Stage" seeks to inquire into the origin of Yoruba tragedy. In Soyinka's account, tragedy, in the Yoruba world view, originated from the gods' consciousness of their own incomplete- ness or what Soyinka has called "the anguish of severance" (145). The idea of severance takes us back to what Soyinka refers to elsewhere as the principle of "complementarity" (19), that is, the need for the gods to continually experience the human in them? selves and a parallel urge in man to reassume his divine essence. The interaction of the divine and the human both in god and man leads to the achievement of a full personality, a unity of being, which fosters what Soyinka terms in a larger context "cosmic total - ity" (3). In physical terms, the gods once lived here on earth with the humans, and their partnership was marked by camaraderie and mutual regard for each other. However, either through sin or default, an estrangement occurred between man and god, and the gods withdrew into the upper regions of ether for their habitation. The estrangement is symbolized in metaphysical or religious terms as the thick undergrowth of matter and nonmatter which Soyinka, borrowing a phrase from Nietzsche, calls "the chthonic realm" (2). It was the destiny of Soyinka's god, Ogun, to do battle with the forces of the chthonic realm, to bridge the gap between man and god and thus to reestablish the principle of complementarity. "Into this universal womb plunged and emerged Ogun, the first actor, disintegrating within the abyss" (121). Ogun's pathway through the abyss of being and nonbeing is what Soyinka has called</page><page sequence="9">9 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC "the gulf of transition" (149). And Ogun was able to confront the dark forces of the abyss and to hack his way through it because he was the embodiment of the will, for only the will can dare the abyss and emerge therefrom unscathed. The first actor, in the Yoruba drama, was Ogun, the first darer and conqueror of transi? tion, and the first art was the tragic art (123). Tragic consciousness in Yoruba drama is the protagonist's aware? ness of his parallel progress through the abyss of transition, for, as Soyinka has noted, "Yoruba tragic drama is the re-enactment of the cosmic conflict" (150). Tragic destiny in general is man's re- enactment of Ogun's rite of passage. Individual misfortune and tribulations are viewed as personal reflections ofthe god's agony: On the arena of the living, when man is stripped of excres- cences, when disasters and conflicts (the material of drama) have crushed and robbed him of self-consciousness and pre- tensions, he stands in present reality at the spiritual edge of this gulf, he has nothing left in physical existence which suc- cessfully impresses upon his spiritual or psychic perception. It is at such moments that transitional memory takes over and intimations rack him of that intense parallel of his progress through the gulf of transition. (149) In prison Soyinka experienced an agony parallel to his god's and was able to overcome the dark forces within the "abyss of transi? tion" through the agency of his own will. On the other hand, Elesin Oba in Death and the King's Horseman skirted the abyss but lacked the courage (will) to make the perilous plunge. The will, in Soyinka's thinking, is the tragic hero's greatest asset in the abyss of transition; and music, in at least one Western phi? losophy, is the expression of the will. Soyinka marries the two to? gether (will and music) in his own theory, taking his cue from Schopenhauer, who had asserted that music is the "direct copy of the will itself":21 If we agree that, in the European sense, music is the "direct copy or the direct expression of the will," it is only because nothing rescues man (ancestral, living or unborn) from loss of self within this abyss but a titanic resolution of the will whose ritual summons, response, and expression is the strange alien sound to which we give the name of music. (149) Soyinka goes beyond the Western definition of music as the mani-</page><page sequence="10">10 Obiajuru Maduakor festation of the will by relating music properly to ritual and drama. In his view music is the tragic hero's sole companion at the charged moment of his self-individuation: This masonic union of sign and melody, the true tragic music, unearths cosmic uncertainties which pervade human existence, reveals the magnitude and power of creation, but above all creates a harrowing sense of omni-directional vastness where the creative Intelligence resides and prompts the soul to futile exploration. The senses do not at such moments interpret myth in their particular concretions; we are left only with the emotional and spiritual values, the essential experience of cosmic reality. The forms of music are not correspondences at such moments to the physical world, not at this nor at any other moment. The singer is a mouthpiece of the chthonic forces ofthe matrix and his somnabulist "improvisations" ... are not representations of the ancestor, recognitions of the living or unborn, but of the no man's land of transition between and around these temporal definitions of experience. (148) However, Soyinka's explanation of the function of music in ritual drama is not so different from Nietzsche's view of it as he claims. The insight into the magnitude of creation which dawns on the tragic hero through music is the counterpart of the retreat into the maternal womb of being or Original Oneness that, Nietzsche claims, is brought upon the Dionysian artist by the magnetic spells of music.22 Ogun's pathway, the gulf of transition, is the fourth stage. The word "stage" underscores its connotation as a scene of action, but the fourth stage implies much more than an arena of action. So? yinka's imagination waxes philosophical in the course ofthe essay. The "anguish of severance," for instance, is translated in philo? sophical terms as the "fragmentation of essence from self, of essence from itself" (145). Religion is man's symbolic efforts to halt the separation. We must view the fourth area of experience as a physi? cal, metaphysical, and symbolic reality. As a physical definition of space, the fourth stage is a synthesis of Miltonian heli and the Yoruba conception ofthe original abode of cosmic forces. Soyinka calls it "the seething cauldron of the dark world will and psyche" (142). Still, Soyinka resorts to Jungian psychology in an effort to clarify further his definition of the fourth space. One might view it as a symbolic representation ofthe Jungian "collective unconscious,"</page><page sequence="11">11 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC for it is also defined as "the vortex of archetypes and kiln of primal images" (36). Soyinka is at pains to define the exact nature and topography of the fourth area of experience. Below is a conglomer- ation of denotations: (1) the womb of origin or of universal Oneness (30, 153) (2) the territory of essence ideal (1) (3) the unconscious (153) (4) the matrix of cosmic creativity or of essence (153) (5) the creative cauldron of cosmic powers (145) (6) the deep black whirlpool of mythopoeic forces (153) (7) the source of creative and destructive energies (154) (8) the transitional yet inchoate matrix of death and becoming (142) (9) the seething cauldron of dark world will and psyche (142) What immediately emerges is the identification of the fourth area of experience with the source of poetic intuition, which is hardly surprising, since Ogun is himself the god of creativity. Thus, the numinous area of transition is the home of the tragic muse. "Tragic music," says Soyinka, "is an echo from that void," and he goes on: The source of the possessed lyricist, chanting hitherto un? known mythopoeic strains whose antiphonal refrain is, how? ever, instantly caught and thrust with all its terror and awe- someness into the night by swaying votaries, this source is residual in the numinous area of transition. (148-49) Still there is a metaphysical edge to the meaning of the fourth stage. It is a connecting link (a passage) between the three areas of existence defined by Yoruba ontology as the world of the ancestor, the living, and the unborn. A diagrammatical representation of this ontological universe is shown in figure 1. The gulf of transition is a symbol of continuity: it permits free traffic between the three areas of existence, and the transitional passage, being Ogun's pathway, establishes Ogun's primacy as the god ofthe "road." Soyinka's essay endorses a view of artistic creativity that is tragic. This view holds, as Yeats would say, that all the great poems of the world have their foundations fixed in agony. Both Yeats and the Nigerian poet Okigbo uphold the notion of a tragic creativity whose metaphoric summation is contained in Yeats's observation that "the poet has made his home in the serpent's mouth."23 Both Soyinka and his god, Ogun, are tragic artists. Ogun immersed himself in the seething cauldron of the dark-world will to forge a</page><page sequence="12">The fourth stage or the bridge of transition Fig. 1.

For his courage he was rewarded with the appellations: "primogenitor ofthe artist as creative hu? man" and "forerunner and ancestor of palaeotechnic man" (150). When we transfer Ogun's action to its artistic complement, we have the following statement: To act, the Promethean instinct of rebellion, channels anguish into a creative purpose which releases man from a totally de- structive despair, releasing from within him the most ener- getic, deeply combative inventions which, without usurping the territory of the infernal gulf, bridges it with visionary hopes. Only the battle of the will is thus primally creative; from its spiritual stress springs the soul's despairing cry which proves its own solace, which alone reverberating within the cosmic vaults usurps . . . the power ofthe abyss. (146) The soul's despairing cry which proves its own solace and which alone usurps the powers of the abyss is poetry. Soyinka's essay is insightful on the subject of hubris. Soyinka's master, Nietzsche, sees hubris as a tragic necessity. In his view hubris is at the root of every tragic myth, for, as he says, "how should man force nature to yield up her secrets but by successfully resisting her, that is to say, by unnatural acts?"24 Wisdom, Nietz? sche goes on, is a crime committed against the gods, for it has equipped the sage with divine secrets. But the acquisition of such rare wisdom is accompanied by an attendant penalty. This, says Nietzsche, is the inexorable logic ofthe law of karma: "Whoever, in pride of knowledge, hurls nature into the abyss of destruction. must himself experience nature's disintegration."25 Soyinka applied the insights derived from Nietzsche to Ogun's act of hubris. Ogun's defiance of the cosmic forces that lay guard- ian to the yet inchoate matrix of being and nonbeing is in the very nature of Ogun's destiny and of tragedy in general. Tragic fate is the repetitive cycle of the taboo in nature, the karmic act of hubris witting or unwitting, into which the demonic will within man constantly compels him. Powerful tragic drama follows upon the act of hubris, and myth exacts this attendant penalty from the hero where he has actually emerged victor of a conflict. (156) But Soyinka stretches the idea of hubris beyond the need to exact personal penalty from the hero. He weaves the concept of hubris</page><page sequence="14">14 Obiajuru Maduakor into the fabric of the Yoruba world view. In this context hubris is a factor in the cyclic resolution of man's metaphysical situation. It triggers a chain reaction which "hurts" and "benefits" nature. The whirlpool of transition requires occasional hubristic invasions for its continuous regeneration. The role of hubris as a mechanism for guaranteeing the continuity of cosmic balance and harmony is stressed in the passage that follows: Offences even against nature may be part of the exaction by deeper nature from humanity of acts which alone can open up the deeper springs of man and bring about a constant re- juvenation of the human spirit. Nature in turn benefits by such broken taboos, just as the cosmos does by demands made upon its will by man's cosmic affronts. Such acts of hubris compel the cosmos to delve deeper into its essence to meet the human challenge. Penance and retribution are not therefore aspects of punishment for crime but the first acts of a resumed awareness, an invocation ofthe principle of cosmic adjust- ment. (156) And because restitution in the natural order is possible through the act of hubris, hubris becomes itself an essential element in the Yoruba concept of morality, for morality for the Yoruba, we are told, is that which creates harmony in the cosmos. The issue of morality is taken up more fully in the second ritual essay, "Morality and Aesthetics in the Ritual Archetype." First, the problem of definition. The operative words in the title of this essay are contained in the term "ritual archetype." The term is to be understood in its specific meaning for Soyinka and in its orig? inal Jungian sense. "Ritual archetype" is used in the main body of the essay as an expression synonymous with "the drama of the gods." This drama is essentially a ritual (and a rite of passage), and the gods themselves are the first actors in the drama. It is therefore primal or primordial, that is, archetypal. Human enactments of the drama of the gods are imitations of the archetypal original. Soyinka uses the words ritual and drama interchangeably in the essay. In his view there can be no legitimate dividing line between ritual and drama. Ritual is drama and drama is ritual. Experts in dramatic literature and criticism would of course contest this view, but they do agree (especially Anthony Graham-White) that "the distinction between ritual and dramatic performances is not often made in traditional African societies."26 And when Soyinka equates ritual with drama, he has traditional African drama in mind. From</page><page sequence="15">15 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC pages 34-35 the word ritual archetype reverts to its original Jung? ian meaning as the primordial inhabitants ofthe "collective un? conscious," or, in Soyinka's typical parlance, "the hinterland of transition." But Soyinka quarrels with Jung for including dream images and psychotic exhalations and deliriums in the category of archetypes. These, says Soyinka, are not archetypes but mere ema- nations from the ephemeral and transient portions of the human psyche, whereas archetypes proceed from the congealed substrata of the psyche which are constantly enriched by the moral and his- toric experience of man. In spite of Soyinka's criticism of Jung, his understanding of myth has been enriched by the achievement of Jungian psychology. Soyinka proceeds to illustrate the issue of morality and aesthetics in the drama of the gods by using examples from the dramatic lit? erature based on the myth and history of his favorite deities: Sango, Obatala, and Ogun. His basic argument is that the gods are con- ceived among the Yoruba within the context of human fallibility. They are prone to an act of error which disrupts nature, in expia- tion of which the gods are condemned to penance. Their conse- quent penance restores order in the world of man and in the cos? mos. Morality in Yoruba world view is bound up with the manda? tory compensations that nature demands. It is predicated on the dialectics of challenge and response, on action and counteraction, on the hubristic infractions on nature which, in turn, compel upon nature countering contingency measures for the reassertion of its totality. The drama that develops from the history of these gods is a rite of passage distinguished by the three-part structure that is basic to all rites of passage, that is, ordeal and ritual death fol? lowed by rebirth. This ritual dialectic has wider implications; it is linked with the cyclical dynamics of nature, that is, with the alternating cycles of death and life, dearth and plenty, drought and rain. The ordeal of the gods is nature's own mechanism for its own renewal. These gods are vegetation deities to a certain extent, for they possess af- finities with such nature deities as Osiris, Ishtar, and Thammuz. Sango's destiny at the positive end of the dialectical axis is apo- theosis, aptly defined by Soyinka as "the joining of energies in cosmic continuity" (11). As the god of thunder and lightning, Sango is the "cosmic instrument of swift retributive justice" (8). Sango's history is the history of an anthropomorphic deity. A one- time tyrant of the ancient kingdom of Oyo, Sango himself became the victim of his own cunning. He had conspired with some of his henchmen to eliminate two of the most powerful warlords in</page><page sequence="16">16 Obiajuru Maduakor his kingdom, Gbonka and Timi. The first strategy, which failed, was to expose them to the risk of death in a war with an external aggressor. The second, which succeeded, was to set them against one another in a single combat. The stronger of the two warlords, Gbonka, defeated his rival and emerged from the combat wiser. He confronted Sango with his machinations and demanded his throne. Sango considered the challenge an affront to his royal dig? nity. In a fit of rage he set upon his own people and slaughtered his subjects, thereby committing a sacrilege upon nature that he had to atone for by exile and suicide. But after his death by hang- ing, his very subjects who had abandoned their king at his mo? ment of trial admired the dead king for his courage to dare the abyss of transition through ritual suicide and proclaimed him a god. Sango's slaughter of his own people was the consequence of his hubristic neglect of the virtues of self-control. Obatala's own error resulted from his addiction to palm wine. He was drunk as he was engaged with the divine duties of mold- ing human shapes with clay, for he was the god of creation. His craftsman's fingers faltered from his excessive intake of alcohol, and he molded albinos, hunchbacks, and cripples. Obatala became guilty of criminal deviations from the aesthetics of creation. Neme- sis caught up with Obatala when he visited his old friend Sango at Oyo. Suspected of an intent to steal Sango's horse, Obatala was clamped into prison, and creation came to a standstill because the god who turns blood into children was languishing in jail. The imprisonment of Obatala disrupted harmony in the cosmos and in the world of man, which was restored after the god's release. We have here an anomalous situation in which the crimes of the gods are visited upon mankind. This cannot be otherwise, says Soyinka, because "the relationship between man and god (embod- iment of nature and cosmic principles) cannot be seen in any other terms but in those of naturalness" (15). In the Ogun's case we are already familiar with his hubristic in? vasion ofthe whirlpools of transition. The cosmic forces that guard the pool postponed Ogun's penalty till the fateful moment at the battle of Ire when, under the influence of alcohol, Ogun massa- cred his own men. For that unwitting act Ogun is compelled to visit earth annually in atonement for his day of error. His visit up? on earth means harvest, and his withdrawal implies drought and scarcity. The alternating cycles of harvest and scarcity are rational- ized in the Yoruba psyche in the myth of the god's descent to earth and his subsequent withdrawal. This myth is the subject of the long poem Idanre \</page><page sequence="17">17 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC He comes, who scrapes no earth dung from his feet He comes again in Harvest, the first of reapers Night is our tryst when sounds are clear And silences ring pure tones as the pause Ofironbells.27 The African gods retain the importance ascribed to them by the African world view in their home grounds, but those of them that survive in the Americas have lost the position assigned to them by popular imagination in the cosmic arrangement. In Brazil, for ex? ample, the Yoruba god Obatala is known as Oxala. Soyinka used the example of the changes brought upon the essence of Obatala (Oxala) through his syncretic associations with the Christian God in the Americas to illustrate the relevance of the second keyword (aesthetics) in the title of the essay under discussion. A comparison of two versions of the Obatala passion play, one supposedly by a Nigerian playwright and the other by a Brazilian, helped Soyinka to advance his argument. In their associations with the Christian saints, the African gods in the Americas have inherited the Western mind's conception of deity as an Olympian archetype. This view of the gods is the direct heritage of the Platonic-Christian tradition which has encouraged the gradual erosion of Earth in the Western metaphysical universe. It runs counter to the very geocentric dis- positions of the gods themselves which have brought them closer within the sphere of human fallibility in the African world view. In the play The Imprisonment of Obatala, the gods assert their humanity. They dine, wine, and chat with men and are prone to human foibles and weaknesses. In Zora Zeljan's play, on the other hand, The Story of Oxala, the African gods emerge as transcen- dental deities, inhabiting a sphere separate from the humans. It is this sense of their remoteness, the differing attitude to the gods in the two versions of the Obatala tragedy (i.e., the contrast be? tween Obatala's earthiness in the first play and Oxala's ethereal incorporeality in Zora Zeljan's version), that Soyinka seeks to con- vey with the term aesthetics. In the Brazilian play the gods' reality is defined by the "aesthetics of estrangement" (25). Soyinka holds that the gods are remote in the Brazilian play because in the Amer? icas they have inherited the "attenuation of terrestrialism . . . brought upon by the encounter ofthe gods with Chritian saints" (24). And when this happens the moral imperatives of complemen? tarity become meaningless: When ritual archetypes acquire new aesthetic characteristics,</page><page sequence="18">18 Obiajuru Maduakor we may expect re-adjustments of the moral imperatives that brought them into existence in the first place, at the centre of man's effort to order the universe. (25) But one wonders, however, whether the word aesthetics has been employed in its proper context in Soyinka's essay. Is it not, indeed, possible that Soyinka is merely attracted by the rhythmic resonance of the word aesthetics for its sake, which, in conjunction with the rest of the words in the title, reads like a line of verse? But equally impiied in the term aesthetics, though not specifically illustrated in Soyinka's essay, is the staging logistics of the drama of the gods, the mode of presentation, details of space, music, poetry, and the producer's consciousness ofthe need to elicit from ritual archetypes "the emotive progression which leads to a communal ecstasy or catharsis" (5-6). The third ritual essay, "Drama and the African World-View," has two main thrusts, one expository and the other applied. The expository focus dwells upon the symbolic function of space in ritual theater. In the second part of the essay, Soyinka discusses two plays, J. P. Clark's Song of a Goat (1964) and Duro Ladipo's Oba Koso (1964), which appear to him to illustrate the way drama can reflect the African world view. First, what are the main features of Soyinka's pet concept, Afri? can world view? These may be summarized as follows: the union of essences both divine and human in man and god, the replenish- ment and continuance of which guarantees unity of being in both man and god. Transferred to the world of nature, Soyinka sees this union as "animist interfusion of all matter and consciousness" (145). Cosmic balance is a function ofthe harmonious relationship between separate entities within the cosmic envelope, that is, the healthy interaction of the spiritual, the human, and the natural forces. This leads us naturally to the role of hubris as an agency of shock: it is nature's mechanistic device for its own regeneration. Without the challenge of the cosmic status quo through hubris, cosmic equilibrium runs the risk of being locked up in a condition of sterile harmony. Add to all this the movement of transition be? tween the world of the ancestor, the living, and the unborn, and the reality of the fourth space acting as a channel for transition. This is linked to a cyclic conception of time whereby, in Soyinka's view, "life, present life, contains within it manifestations ofthe ancestral, the living, and the unborn" (144). What emerges is a homogeneous world view in which the con? stituent elements are interrelated and inseparable from one another</page><page sequence="19">19 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC without the risk of disrupting the cosmic order. This view of the universe is not peculiar to the African mind. Elements of it can be observed in other cultures. There are, for instance, affinities be? tween this world view insofar as its ultimate goal is a harmonious relationship between man and his environment and the ordered hierarchy of the Elizabethan world view. Two plays are related to this world view: Song ofa Goat and Oba Koso. We encountered Oba Koso in the essay on "ritual archetypes" where Sango attains apotheosis through self-sacrifice. The action itself is a heroic gesture in spite of the crime against nature that motivated it, and it turns out as an event that became beneficial to the human community. As a tyrant and a murderer, Sango was an abnormal growth on the body of nature. Nature can only be returned to a condition of harmony through a total ex? cision of the abnormal outgrowth. Sango wins the reader's sym? pathy through his courage to dare the abyss. We have in the play a world reminiscent of the universe of Song ofa Goat in which man's bonds with nature are visceral. Timi, one ofthe protagonists in the play, was encouraged by his consciousness of this union of man and nature to summon nature to his aid in his own rites of passage: I come this day to Ede town It is the gentle wind that says, blow towards me Spirits of swarming termites say, swarm towards me Two hundred rafters support the house Two hundred lizards support the wall Let all hands be raised to sustain me. (59) The tragedy in Song ofa Goat lies not in the crime of incest but in Zifa's sexual impotence and his sterile pride which threatens the continuity of the species. Therein inheres the worst breakdown in moral order. Soyinka explains: Where society lives in a close inter-relation with Nature, regu- lates its existence by natural phenomena within the observ- able processes of continuity?ebb and tide, waxing and wan- ing of the moon, rain and drought, planting and harvest?the highest moral order is seen as that which guarantees a parallel continuity of the species. (52) The theoretical focus of the third ritual essay deals with the met? aphysical implications of the stage in ritual theater. These implica-</page><page sequence="20">20 Obiajuru Maduakor tions were enumerated early in the essay on "ritual archetypes." The stage, says Soyinka, is a microcosmic copy ofthe chthonic realm, which requires the presence of "a challenger, a human representative to breach it periodically on behalf of the well-being ofthe community" (3). Soyinka made this statement with special reference to the drama of the gods, but he maintains that even in ordinary ritual drama or in the so-called realistic or literary drama, this view of the stage still holds. But it is the function of the stage in ritual theater, its metaphysical implications that exercise the greatest fascination for Soyinka. In its metaphysical context the stage is to be seen as a symbolic representation of earth and the cosmos, and the actor on the stage is a human challenger reenact- ing man's existential predicaments. The stage is to be viewed as one arena in which man has attempted to come to terms with the spatial phenomenon of his being. Soyinka returns again and again to the cosmic definition of the stage. Two more representative citations might suffice: The concern of ritual theatre in this process of spatial defini? tion . . . must . . . be seen as an integral part of man's con- stant efforts to master the immensity of the cosmos with his minuscule self. (40) And again: Ritual theatre . . . establishes the spatial medium not merely as a physical area for simulated events but as a manageable contraction of the cosmic envelope within which man . . . fearfully exists. (41) The insight revealed in these ritual essays distinguishes Soyinka as an accomplished critic of the ritual stage and must count as original contributions to dramatic theory and criticism. Ideology or Social Vision? Two matters concern us here, namely, the religious and secular dimensions of Soyinka's statements on works of social vision. Two of his essays are to be viewed as further clarifications of Soyinka's position on the issue of ideological commitment in works of lit? erature where ideological commitment connotes a sympathy for a Marxist view of art; and although Soyinka stretches the meaning of ideology to embrace the leading ideas behind such literary move-</page><page sequence="21">21 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC ments as expressionism, surrealism, and negritude, the implication of the term ideology in the essays under consideration is Marxist oriented. This prejudice is understandable considering the fre? quency of Soyinka's own "passage" through the crucibles of Marx? ist literary anatomy at radical circles at the Universities of Ibadan and Ife, where he is found to be ideologically wanting. Soyinka has thus a cause to restate and redefine his position in the con? text of the on-going debate on literature and ideology. He says yes to a social vision and no to a literary ideology because of the latter's tendency to limit and impose upon the free operations of the crea? tive spirit. Works of literature, says Soyinka, are "essentially fluid operations of the creative mind upon social and natural phenomena'' (61). In a literary ideology this fluidity yields to rigidity, and the creative imagination is compelled to follow the routes mapped out by ideological manifestoes. The choice for a social vision is de? termined, therefore, by Soyinka's regard for the integrity and autonomy of the creative artist, but autonomy does not preclude social relevance. The artist, as the popular saying goes, does not live in an ivory tower. His visionary imaginings have the good of society as their goal. A prime function of art in its social context, says Soyinka, is "the visionary reconstruction ofthe past for the purposes ofa social direction" (106). This definition of literature's social role is a carry-over from Soyinka's earlier view on the role of a writer in a modern African state. In the essay on that subject pubiished in 1967, Soyinka charges the African writer with a de- plorable lack of "vision." The African writer is urged to abandon the "historic" vision inherent in negritude so that he could the more easily center his gaze on the immediate realities of his so? ciety. Only through the acquisition of a realist vision, says Soyinka, could the writer resume the real essence of himself as "the record of the mores and experience of his society and as the voice of vision in his own time."28 The writer's capacity to combine the gains of historic and realist visions into a constructive program for the future is what might amount to a social vision. The very conception of the writer's social program as an alternative that is attainable only in the future renders that image of society a visionary projection. Soyinka is at pains indeed to define what he exactly means by "social vision." We have several tentative offerings: (1) The reflection of experience is only one of the functions of literature. . . . And when that experience is social we move into areas of ideological projections, the social vision. (64)</page><page sequence="22">22 Obiajuru Maduakor (2) A creative concern which conceptualises or extends actuality beyond the purely narrative, making it reveal realities beyond the immediately attainable, a concern which upsets orthodox acceptances in an effort to free society of historical or other superstitions, these are qualities possessed by literature of a social vision. (66) (3) A re-statement of the values of past or present in inte- grated perspectives of a future potential. (98) The continuous search for definition is necessary because So? yinka insists on making a distinction between a social vision and a socialist (revolutionary) vision. If the distinction must be main- tained, it follows that a socialist revolutionary fiction might belong to the category of social vision, whereas not all works of a social vision are transposable to the socialist revolutionary category. The problem is compounded by the introduction of a religious factor into Soyinka's conception of a social vision. The way out of the dilemma is to qualify again his definition of social vision in terms of its relationship to a socialist revolutionary fiction: Revolutionary writing is generally of this kind [the category of a social vision], though whether or not much of the writing which aspires to the label is always literature is another ques? tion. (66) It is his suspicion that most revolutionary writings might not quali? fy as literature that compels Soyinka to prefer the expression social vision to the term socialist revolutionary vision. His preference for social vision enables him to bring a wide spectrum of fiction under the label. The practical illustration of his thesis is easier for Soyinka than his theoretical definitions. Since he draws his examples from works of fiction, we can distinguish three categories of fiction: (1) social realist fiction; (2) socialist realist fiction; (3) social visionary fiction. Social realist fictions are generally novels of disillusionment, the kind of fiction that exemplifies the pressure on the African writer to assume a realist vision. Soyinka's first novel, The Interpreters (1965), belongs to this group. Others include Alex La Guma's A Walk in the Night (1964), Achebe's A Man ofthe People (1966), and Armah's The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born (1969), to name only a few examples. The social realist fiction makes no pre-</page><page sequence="23">2 3 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC tensions to a social vision, although Armah's The Beautyful Ones moves from the social realist level to a social visionary plane at the tail end of the novel when Armah en visions the symbolic, solitary flower positioned in the center of the elegiac inscription "The beautyful ones are not yet born." The birth ofthe "beautyful ones" is predicted in the image of the beautiful flower and ful- filled in Armah's third novel, Two Thousand Seasons (1973). Under the second category we include Soyinka's own novel Season of Anomy (1973), Ousmane Sembene's God's Bits ofWood (1970), Armah's Two Thousand Seasons (1973), and Ngugi's Petals of Blood(1911). Only two of these novels (God's Bits ofWoodand Two Thousand Seasons) are discussed in Soyinka's essay. They qualify as works of social vision because they make projections on the nature of society. They have one thing in common: the image of society they envisage is one that is egalitarian. Social visionary novels are those works that project an image of the ideal status quo that the author considers best for his society either now or in the future. This vision is similar to the hopes of the novels of the second category, but the novelist need not, in this case, embody his dreams in revolutionary terms. Soyinka is thinking here of the visions of ideal society entertained by a great many African novelists either from a religious salvationist or other (secular) ethos. Iconoclastic literature (which may not necessarily be socialist oriented) belongs to the category of social vision. The posi? tive values held by the author may be inferred from the negative values he destroys. This is particularly true of Ouologuem's Bound to Violence (1971), which "upsets orthodox acceptances in an effort to free society of historical or other superstitions" (66). The super? stition in this case is the Arab-Islamic colonization of Black Africa. Ouologuem, Soyinka believes, has deliberately countered Hamidou Kane's claim in The Ambiguous Adventure (1972) that Islam is "one religion whose ethics, philosophy and form of worship recon- ciles races and encourages universal fraternalism" (77). When we come to Camara Laye's novels, The Dark Child'(1955) and The Radiance ofthe King (1956), Soyinka's thesis falters a little. We have a secular vision in these works which is not neces? sarily social. If we insist on Soyinka's other definition of social vision as "a re-statement of the values of past or present in inte- grated perspectives ofa future potential," Laye's Radiance ofthe King does not embody a social vision. It restates the values of the past (the African world view) but offers no projections about the nature of society in the future. The Radiance is best understood in</page><page sequence="24">24 Obiajuru Maduakor terms of its achievement as a work that vindicates the authenticity of the African world view just as that world view is best illustrated in drama by Song of a Goat and Oba Koso. It is Achebe's rather ambivalent attitude to that world view in his third novel Arrow of God (1964) that creates some obstacle (in Soyinka's view) in our determination of the role of the gods in that novel. Incidents involving the supernatural or the mystical are not presented in a situation of sustained dignity in Achebe's novels. His attitude to the divine is cavalier, sometimes irreverent, and often determined by political rather than spiritual considerations. The imprisonment of Ezeulu, who is half-man half-spirit, was a good enough opportunity for the writer in the mythic mode to visit upon nature the cosmic implications of that hubristic breach of nature, but curiously, Achebe avoids any spiritual dimenions of the priest's experience of exile. In the earlier essay, "From a Com? mon Back Cloth," Soyinka commends Achebe for according the mystical its due place in the order of things in his first novel Things Fail Apart (1958). We have in that novel a pattern of "understated mysteries . . . of psychical influences on daily routine, ofa man's personal chi, of initiations, of guilt and purifications whose ethics are not those of a court of law but of the forces of Nature cycle, of the living and the dead."29 In Arrow of God the story is dif? ferent: Considerations of the authenticity of spiritual inspiration, or of manifestations which may be considered supernatural, or at the least, ominous coincidences, are given alternative (secular) ex- plications in the casual reflections of members of his [Achebe's] Igbo community, coloured as always by individual problems or positions taken in sectional confrontations. In short, col? oured by their humanity. (87) These remarks underscore the difference between the temperament of the imagination of the two writers. It is a difference between the mythic imagination (Soyinka) and the historical imagination (Achebe). Soyinka's reading of Achebe's novel from a mythic perspective is innovative, being so different from the general concerns of Achebe criticism. Most critics have tended to situate Achebe's novels mere? ly in their historical and cultural context, but we have here a new approach which is refreshing. Soyinka holds that religious factors may also determine a writer's conceptions about the nature of society. He is thinking here of two</page><page sequence="25">2 5 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC main religions: the Christian religion and the Islamic religion. The point here is that there are some novels in which the author's re? ligious background has influenced the resolution of the plot. This resolution is often superimposed, thereby weakening the strength of the novels concerned. Such an interference from a religious ideology is comparable, in the secular sector, to a forced resolution which might have been determined by a socialist ideology. In William Conton's novel The African (1960) and in the play The Rhythm of Violence (1964) by Lewis Nkosi, the logical progression of the plot is distorted by a Christian salvationist ethic which pre- tends that a fraternal understanding between races could be brought about through the affirmation of Christian values. In Conton's novel the value asserted is forgiveness, and in Nkosi's play it is love. "These," says Soyinka, "are the ethical lines on which an envisioned regeneration of society will be based" (70), hence the author's social vision. Other writers ensnared, Soyinka thinks, by the illusions of the Christian vision are Alan Paton and Peter Abrahams: they were reprimanded in the earlier essay "From a Common Black Cloth" (1963). Nearly two decades later Soyinka has cause to return to them with his first judgments on these novels still unchanged. The Islamic vision is represented by Hamidou Kane's novel Ambiguous Adventure. The summation of the Islamic viewpoint is contained in Soyinka's preliminary observations to his discussion of Hamidou Kane's novel: In colonial societies which constantly seek a world-view to challenge the inherent iniquities of any philosophy which can be associated with the colonial intrusion, we naturally en? counter works which make a point of claiming that Islam . . . is one religion whose ethics, philosophy and form of worship reconciles races and encourages universal fraternalism. (77) In Kane's hand the Islamic vision is shown to be less harmful to the creative imagination than William Conton's or Lewis Nkosi's handling of the Christian message of love and forgiveness in their own works. The Islamic vision is not consciously upgraded to the level of propaganda in Kane's novel, and because the question of propaganda is very remote from the author's mind, the novel achieves a more satisfying resolution of its conflicts through the author's evocation of his religious background than the mechanical imposition of Christian values on The African and Rhythm of Vio? lence. Death is the logical outcome of Samba Diallo's apostasy. It</page><page sequence="26">26 Obiajuru Maduakor is the doctrine of death, the standpoint of the grand master of the Word, the Teacher, which had the final word in the novel's logical and natural resolution of its conflicts, not the traditional Diallobe society, nor the West which was responsible for the weakening of Diallo's spiritual roots (85). The closing paragraphs of the essay rest ate Soyinka's long-stand- ing objections to negritude. Three key issues are at stake here. The first (the Cartesian fallacy) is the naivete of the founding fathers of the negritude movement itself, a naivete that manifested itself in their uncritical acceptance of Eurocentric prejudices and racist ideologies. Descartes had said, "I think, therefore I am"; and that supreme Cartesian, Senghor, came up with a variant ofthe Cartesian proposition: "I feel, therefore I am." Soyinka wonders why an intellectual movement that is anti-European should borrow its self-characterizing definitions from a European system of thought. Negritude's "reference points took far too much colouring from European ideas even while its Messiahs pronounced themselves fanatically African" (127). The second objection (the aesthetic fallacy) is negritude's atti? tude to the principle of creativity; it adopted a defeatist self-justi- fying aesthetic stance which breeds a poetry of self-contemplation rather than a poetry of action. Soyinka regards the poetry of self- contemplation as a form of "narcissism." Soyinka recalls the points made in the earlier essay "And after the Narcissist?" in one im? portant statement. One of the unfortunate by-products of negri? tude was "a mounting narcissism which involved contemplation of the contrived self in the supposed tragic grandeur of the cultural dilemma" (130). The third objection (the dialectical fallacy) was the fallacy of the dialectical self-resolution predicted by Sartre for negritude. Negri? tude, says Sartre, occupies a middle position in the three-stage movement of an inexorable dialectical progression. The first move? ment (the thesis) is the assertion of white supremacy that gave birth to negritude in the first instance; the second stage (the antith- esis) is the countering of this supremacist ideology by negritude, that is, the birth of negritude; the third stage (the synthesis) will resolve itself in the ultimate cancellation of the racial concepts in both the thesis and the antithesis. This stage will witness the union of all the workers of the world (both white and black) in a pro- letarian struggle for the establishment of a raceless society. Soyinka commends Sartre and his dialectical ancestor, Descartes, for their logical thinking: they are people who think, white creatures in pith helmets in an African jungle who think, but their thinking</page><page sequence="27">27 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC should have opened their eyes to the one reality of negritude: it was the property of a bourgeois intellectual elite, and as such it had no chance of integrating itself in the destiny of the working classes. Although all these objections are interrelated, the most impor? tant of them all, because it concerns itself with the theme of cre? ativity, is the second objection. And this brings us back to the subject of the essays in this section, the question of ideology and literature. Negritude tended to channel its creative energies through a particular mode of artistic expression?the contemplative narcis? sistic mode. This bending of the natural disposition of the creative mind to accommodate certain preconceived ideas is the bane of all literary ideologies. The principles of creativity cannot be legislated. "The practical effects," writes Soyinka, of literary ideology "on the creative process lead to predictability, imaginative constraint, and thematic excisions" (65). All this does not mean that there is no fallacy in Soyinka's own argument. The definition of negritude in terms of the Cartesian proposition runs into the same dilemma as the very act of writing African literature or Soyinka's literary criticism in a European lan? guage. We cannot accept the view which asserts that "the writer is far more preoccupied with visionary projection of society than with speculative projection on the nature of literature" (64). The writer in fact is concerned with both. Most great writers, Matthew Arnold, Yeats, and Eliot, have indeed speculated on the nature of litera? ture and of its relation to society. Nor can we accept the reasoning that relegates the question of literary ideology to the province of the critic only. Ngugi, Armah, and Sembene have steered their art along consciously formulated ideological convictions. "It is only in the socialist context," wrote Ngugi in 1968 on the issue of an ideological program for African literature, "that a look at yesterday can be meaningful in illuminating today and tomorrow."30 Nine years later Armah echoes this view: "In my people's world revolu? tion would be the only art, revolutionaries the only creators. All else is part of Africa's destruction."31 The arguments of Soyinka's two essays on ideology and the social vision carry further the points he made in a lecture delivered at the University of Washington's faculty seminar in 1973. The lecture entitled "Drama and the Revolutionary Ideal" focused interest on the pitfalls of ideological commitment in drama. Soyinka's con? clusion was that ideological interests were bound to weaken drama's integrity as an art form because drama is by its very nature a revo? lutionary medium. It is the only art form that is extremely vul-</page><page sequence="28">28 Obiajuru Maduakor nerable to ideological manipulation. To superimpose an ideology on an art form that is intrinsically revolutionary is to overburden the form. The insertion of an ideology into drama's structure could, however, be adroitly managed by a gifted dramatist through the medium of ritual, but in lesser hands the result is frequently a melodrama. Soyinka feels that the consciously worker-proletarian- motivated drama written by Arnold Wesker (Roots) or Edward Albee (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) and the social visionary plays written by Lewis Nkosi (Rhythm of Violence) and Alton Ku- malo (Themba) suffer from contrived anguish and enforced resolu? tion. He reaffirms the point I made earlier that literary ideology (usually the concern of the critic rather than of the writer) has the tendency to "dam up the creative paths natural to the writer's peculiar genius and lead him toward artificial concepts of prole- tarian art."32 Since revolutionary tendencies are inbuilt within the dramatic mode itself, the less consciously ideological the dramatist appears to be the more effectively would the subversive intent of his message be disseminated: The creative ideal in revolutionary theatre is not a self-con- scious pandering to any proletarian illusion on any level what? ever, be it the spiritual level or the social-revolutionary level, because . . . the matrix of creativity, most especially in the dramatic mode, embraces at all times?both in individual and communal affectiveness?the regenerative potential of society.33 How do rituals function as vectors of social or revolutionary mes? sage? Through the medium of audience participation. This, ac? cording to Soyinka, has been the secret of Ben Caldwell's achieve? ment in The Fanatic and Imamu Baraka's success in the play The Slave Ship. In these plays the revolutionary message has been ef? fectively disguised under the ritual idiom of audience participation. Soyinka is firmly opposed to a conscious injection of ideological motives into works of imaginative literature. This attitude appears to be a self-defensive posture, one that is intended to justify the kind of literature Soyinka himself produces. But whether this atti? tude should lead to a denial of literary ideology in itself as well as of the achievement of writers with obvious ideological motivations is another matter. Also, Soyinka's essay suffers from a weak theo? retical definition. He is unable to convincingly separate the term literary ideology from our understanding of what he calls social</page><page sequence="29">29 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC vision. However, Soyinka's evaluation of the works of the authors discussed in the essays is unquestionably insightful. Controversies Soyinka has come under attack as a writer from two radical schools of criticism. The most outspoken, though perhaps less publicized, is the Marxist school led by Biodun Jeyifo and Femi Osofisan among the Ibadan-Ife leftist critics. The other radical voice in Soyinka criticism is the school of neonegritudist apologetics for authentic traditional African aesthetics led by Chinweizu and his group. The uncompromising posture struck by these two schools in their evalu? ation of Soyinka's work has drawn Soyinka into controversial polem- ics that are not strictly literary criticism but which, nevertheless, do contain some insights that further clarify Soyinka's conceptions on the nature of art. First, the Marxist school of critics. This school of critics approaches a work of art from the materialist-historical perspective. Leon Trot? sky has outlined some key issues in the materialist-historical theory of art.34 These include such fundamental questions as the follow? ing: (1) To what order of feelings does a given artistic work correspond in all its peculiarities? (2) What are the social conditions of these thoughts and feelings? (3) What place do they occupy in the historic development of a society and of a class? (4) Under the influence of what historic impulse and conditions has the work been produced and in what ways have those con? ditions and contradictions been reflected in the work? The Nigerian Marxist critics indict Soyinka for his supreme in- difference to the responsibilities which the materialist theory con- fers upon art. It is the function of art, in the materialist-historical aesthetic, to reflect the historical processes which are at work in society at a given historical moment together with their internal contradictions and tensions (i.e., their dialectics). To the Nigerian Marxians every work of the imagination that dares an independent existence outside the framework of "historical materialism"35 is prone to the charge of deliberate falsification of experience and reality. Other metaphors for falsification are such terms as distor? tion, romanticizing, mythifying, mystifying, and prettifying. So? yinka's natural predilection for a mythic exploration of experience exposed him obviously to the Marxist notions of falsification. Every</page><page sequence="30">30 Obiajuru Maduakor utterance of the Nigerian Marxists echoes the view that Soyinka's perception of history is static, mythic, and therefore unrealistic. In a reading of Soyinka's tragedy, Death and the King's Horseman (1975), Biodunjeyifo speaks of Soyinka's " 'mythopoeic' attitude to history, his constant penchant for transforming experience into metaphysical, trans-historical, mythic dimensions."36 Femi Osofi- san, in the essay "Drama and the New Exotic," ridicules the new exotic stage patronized by such playwrights as Soyinka and Ola Rotimi and peopled by animist gods and utterly indifferent to the logic of "historical contradictions in the dialectics of flux."37 Oma- fume Onoge and G. G. Darah make the same point in their paper "The Retrospective Stage: Some Reflections on the Mythopoeic Tradition at Ibadan." They dismiss as "mythic" and "retrogres- sive" a dramatized historiography ofthe past where antagonistic contradictions do not exist.38 "It is this undialectical approach," they affirm, "plus the pre-eminence ofthe supernatural in the artistic representations of the past that we have termed mytho? poeic."39 Applying the materialist theory to Death and the King's Horseman, Jeyifo finds the play to be guilty of mispresenting and misinterpreting the real identity of the indigenous society. The play, says Jeyifo, did not attempt to highlight the real objective differences between conflicting groups and classes in the indigenous society. What we have, instead, is a rationalization of "the rule of the dazzling FEW . . . over the deceived MANY."40 In an earlier essay on Soyinka's The Road, Jeyifo concedes to Soyinka some awareness of the dialectical processes of history, but that awareness, he feels, is subverted by Soyinka's mythopoeic imagination that has led to a deliberate mystification or reification of a natural in? strument of labor, the road, so that we have in that play a "hid? den" class war rather than an open one: The reification of the road . . . is a mystification: the road (and the vehicles which ply it) is a product of man's labour, a specific item in the ensemble of the forces of production; it is not a manifest destiny unto itself. The Road is imbued with the heavy atmosphere of death, is obsessed by the deaths and "dangerous employment" on the road because it penetrates the "natural," normal aspects of a mode of production in which the relationship between the instruments and tools of labour and the labouring classes is distorted, mythified.41 Several years before the New Marxist radicals began to articulate</page><page sequence="31">31 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC their objections to Soyinka's works, the Kenyan novelist and critic, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, had expressed some dissatisfaction with Soyin? ka's writings along the same lines as those of the Nigerian Marxists. We quote Ngugi in full in illustration of a Marxist criticism that is sober, levelheaded, pedestrian, and bereft of linguistic mystifica- tions: Although Soyinka exposes his society in breadth, the picture he draws is static, for he fails to see the present in the his? torical perspective of conflict and struggle. It is not enough for the African artist, standing aloof, to view society and high- light its weaknesses. He must try to go beyond this, to seek out the sources, the causes and the trends of a revolutionary struggle which has already destroyed the traditional power- map drawn up by the colonialist nations.42 Soyinka's reply to his Marxist critics is contained in the paper "Who's Afraid of Elesin Oba?" delivered to the Conference on Radical Perspectives on African Literature held at Ibadan, in 1977, and in the Inaugural Lecture he delivered at Ife in November 1980 entitled "The Critic and Society." The point of view proffered in these essays is identical, and a detailed analysis would only be un- dertaken at the risk of becoming repetitive. Soyinka reaffirms in these essays the points he had already made in the essay on ideology and social vision. He insists on the autonomy of the creative imagi? nation. Its operations on social and natural phenomena cannot be legislated. Criticism must learn to evaluate works of imagination only in terms ofthe sociology ofthe works' own aesthetic universe. The criticism that seeks in every work of art a causal and historical and socioeconomic network of society is reductionist and arbitrary; it imposes extra burdens on art. "Criticism?dealing with general principles and theories of creativity?has gone beyond its compe? tence and dared to enlarge upon the legitimate purlieu of imagi? native projection."43 On his addiction to myth and ritual, Soyinka believes, as would Jung, that both myth and ritual are relevant to the spiritual needs of modern man. It is only the Western-trained skeptics who would repudiate the element of mystery even in the present contemporary setting. Myth may be viewed as representing the spiritual dimen? sion of the very historical processes which the Nigerian radicals ac? cuse Soyinka of ignoring. The Nigerian critic, Stanley Macebuh, has noted that myth and history complement one another in Soyinka's works:</page><page sequence="32">32 Obiajuru Maduakor To the extent that myth and history are complementary, it may be suggested that Soyinka's persistent meditation on myth is an attempt to reveal the primal foundations of Afri? can culture, and therefore of history.44 Soyinka himself has affirmed his confidence in the mutual inter- dependence of myth and history. My social temperament is not without its complementary ob? jective study of the society we live in and the societies we do not live in but which do impinge on our immediate society.45 The message of the two essays is summed up in the epigrammatic statement: "When art ceases to imitate life, it does not thereby aspire to imitate ideology; while criticism which fails to emulate life ends up as an imitation of art."46 Soyinka is not the kind of writer who will give up easily in in? tellectual debates. His intellect appears to be easily stimulated by polemics. This is proven by the witty, pungent, and incisive replies he metes out to his critics. He tries to use the very logic of the Marxist critics to defeat their own arguments. Marxist criticism, says Soyinka, tends very often to reduce art to an economic com- modity. It treats art even as bourgeois capitalists treat labor: "The work of art is the product of intellectual labour which, without any self-criticism, the critic appropriates to ends other than the ends for which the work is produced and marketed."47 This capitalist attitude to art shows up in the language of the Marxist critic him? self. In spite of his supposed sympathy for the proletariat, the crit- ic's language is not proletarian. It is a "seminarist language re- plete with its infinite discursiveness submerging, distorting and finally appropriating the original commodity in its quotational gar- rulity."48 The next radical voice in Soyinka criticism is the school of critics led by Chinweizu. These critics examined, among other things, the attitudes and tendencies of modern Nigerian poetry between the 1960s and the early 1970s. The poets whose works were scruti- nized are J. P. Clark, Christopher Okigbo, Michael Echeruo, Wole Soyinka, Romanus Egudu, and Okogbule Wonodi. These poets, in the opinion of the Chinweizu critics, are lacking in craft and are found guilty ofthe following faults: (1) old-fashioned, craggy, un- musical language; (2) obscure and inaccessible diction; (3) a pleth- ora of imported imagery; and (4) a divorce from African oral poetic</page><page sequence="33">33 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC tradition. The poet most guilty of these charges may be Soyinka. Of Soyinka's Idanre the Chinweizu critics delivered this verdict: The imagery is imprecise and opaque and lacking in evocative power. All we can decipher is the names of the various deities: Ogun, Sango, Ajantala, Esu, Orunmila, Orishanla [sic]. But in this narrative poem it is never clear who does what to whom and with what consequences. It is often difficult to tell who the many pronouns?he, she, we, us?refer to. We are shut off from the experience on both the intellectual and emo? tional levels. The language is a formidable barrier; and even after you have hacked your way through it, you still cannot understand what, if anything, is supposed to be going on.49 There is merit in these observations; for if, as Soyinka himself has claimed, works of literature are "fluid operations ofthe creative mind upon social and natural phenomena," his, indeed, have not always been so. He injects studied metaphysical strains into the free operation of the creative intuition upon social and natural phenomena. Critic Roderick Wilson had earlier complained of com- plexity and confusion in Soyinka's poetry.50 The Chinweizu en- dorsement of these charges lends them further weight. Soyinka replied to the Chinweizu critics in two essays: "Neo- Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Tradition" (1975) and "Neo- Tarzanism: The Aesthetic Illusion" (1976). The argument of these two essays is similar, although their tones differ. Soyinka defends the disposition of his imagination as a creative artist in these essays. What he calls "selective eclecticism"51 is the technical approach that rewards his imagination, enriching his sensibilities as a poet. As a creative artist, Soyinka is not limited to considerations of local color only (the flora and fauna of the African poetic landscape rec? ommended by the Chinweizu critics) but transcends these to as- similate new experiences from other cultures and traditions. And so the "plethora of imported imagery" cannot but be persistent. Even his attitude to that local environment itself is more complex than an average mind comprehends: My African world is a little more intricate and embraces pre- cision machinery, oil rigs, hydro-electricity, my typewriter, railway trains (not iron snakes), machine guns, bronze sculp? ture, etc, plus an ontological relationship with the universe including the above listed pumpkins and iron bells. This may</page><page sequence="34">34 Obiajuru Maduakor result in a subtle complication in the "narration, reflection and resolution" of these phenomena but emphatically denies the deliberate complicating of them.52 But in spite of his eclectic sensibility it is still necessary to dis? tinguish between the true poet and the imitative poet. The mind of the true poet assimilates disparate experiences only to transform them into a new mintage. The great poets of the world, both dead and living, form part of the cultural inheritance of every poet re- gardless of his background. What distinguishes the genuine poet from the imitative poet is his or her attitude to that cultural heri- tage. The mind of the true poet transforms what it borrows into a new whole, whereas it is the aspiration of the imitative poet to merely echo his or her master's voice: A distinct universal quality in all great poets does . . . exer? cise ghostly influences on other writers?however different in background?at moments when a similarity of the particu- larized experience is shared. For the genuine creative mind, this need not be a cause for self-flagellation. The resulting work is easily judged by its capacity to move one step further, or sidewise; a conceptual variant or sleight-of-thought, by the naturalness of the influence, the thoroughness of ingestion within a new organic mould, its felicitous re- emergence and by the original strength ofthe new organic entity.53 These essays help us to understand Soyinka's views about the nature of poetry. Poetry for him is that metrical composition that is "visceral and sensuous" and "engages the imagination."54 In? deed the "principle of imaginative challenge . . . is one ofthe functions of poetry."55 Also we have gained an insight from the essays into Soyinka's concept of image or symbol. What determines his choice of image is its peculiar potential to spark off "a dynamic relationship which consists of an internalized dialectic of phenomena and perception."56 Because the Chinweizu critics advocate a return to tradition, Soyinka labels them "Neo-Tarzanists" and calls them "advocates ofa noble-savage school of poetics."57 Tradition, he affirms in a different context, does not mean raffia skirts or menstrual loin cloth.58 Of the two essays Soyinka wrote in reply to the Neo-Tarzanists, "Neo-Tarzanism: The Aesthetic Illusion" is more sober, more weighty, less polemical, and more emotionally controlled than</page><page sequence="35">35 SOYINKA AS A LITERARY CRITIC "Neo-Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Tradition." The earlier paper might have been written on the spur ofthe moment. So? yinka appears to have been too emotionally involved with his sub? ject for the essay to have been objective. His judgment in the later essay is more mature and more aesthetically distanced from its im? mediate target and, therefore, more effective as a literary polemic. Conclusion This study has not exhausted all that could be said in a full discus? sion of Soyinka's statements as a literary critic. It has only attempted to analyze the content of his major critical essays in order to under? stand what is being said in them and thereby to gain a fuller under? standing of Soyinka's mind and art, for Soyinka's critical writings illuminate his own works. From his earliest criticism to his latest, Soyinka has urged upon the African writer the philosophy of self- acceptance: the acceptance of the :rue image of the African in works ofthe imagination. The philosophy of acceptance is the inspiration behind the Incidental Essays. Soyinka has quarreled with Senghor and others of the negritude school for distorting Africa's true image in their writings. This denial of the authentic image is at the root of Soyinka's criticism of negritude. The Ritual Essays transport us into the world of Yoruba mythol- ogy, exploring the origin and nature of Yoruba tragedy and the role of hubris in the drama ofthe gods. Tragedy originates from Ogun's sacrifice of his being in the first archetypal space (the fourth stage). Taking their cue from Ogun's example, the other ritual archetypes? Sango and Obatala?have learned to face tragedy as reparation for a previous act of error. It is in the principle of challenge and restitution that (ritual) drama can be related to the African world view. The insights derived from these essays illuminate Soyinka's own works; indeed, the essays are written with the kind of work he produces in mind, for he is a writer in the mythic mode as distinct from one whose imagination is historical. It is here (his mythic imagination) that Soyinka fails short of the expectations of Marxist critics. Indeed, his essays on ideology and social vision reflect the dilemma of the mythic imagination in a world of pragmatic ideology. This is the argument of his literary polemics whenever they do not concern themselves with the problems of poetics. The mythic imagi? nation, he maintains, can hardly consort with ideology in the Marx? ist sense. But it can make projections for the good ofthe future. Such projections constitute what Soyinka means by "social vision." In illustrating his theories with practical examples, Soyinka is an</page><page sequence="36">36 Obiajuru Maduakor accomplished critic; in the formulation of these theories, however, he is not so clear and precise in his meaning. This is understand- able, for Soyinka is primarily a creative writer, not a literary theo- rist. NOTES 1. Clarence Hugh Holman et al., A Handbook to Literature (New York: Odyssey, 1960) 298. 2.
