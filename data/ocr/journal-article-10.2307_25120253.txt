<plain_text><page sequence="1">DR. MCKIM'S "CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIAN SCIENCE"?A REJOINDER BY A CHURCHMAN The weakness of Dr. McKim's paper, which appeared in the March issue of the Review, reveals the strength of Christian Science. It suggests the following incident: Balak said unto Balaam, " I took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether." " How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed?" To make his positions impregnable and his attack effective he declines the issue presented in the article " Must Protes tantism Adopt Christian Science?" which may not be fa miliar ground to him in nis area of experience and study, and shifts to the field of creedal statements, where he is at home. From such a titled thinker, on such a vantage-ground, one may expect arguments which shall clear the field of all error. He holds up the Apostles' Creed as the belief of Christendom and the summary of all Christian truth. He affirms that if the Christian Science Creed does not harmo nize with it, nothing in it can be true, and assumes that it is opposed to the Church Creed and it must therefore be false. His aim is " to show that the Church and Christian Science are irreconcilable, and therefore Protestantism can only adopt Christian Science by abandoning and repudi ating every fundamental doctrine for which it stands." In summing up he says: In every instance I have quoted the very words ... of the founder of this new cult. And the result is that every article of the Apostles' Creed which expresses the faith of Christendom is denied by Christian Science_ Let me also point out that the conclusions I have reached rest upon a solid foundation, because I have drawn them entirely from the book called Science and Health, which is the Bible of this new religion, de clared by its founder to be absolutely without error. . . . The conclusion is</page><page sequence="2">A REJOINDER 723 inevitable, also. This new religion is not the Christian religion, and whoever leaves the Christian Church to attach himself to it becomes an apostate from Christianity. After making all possible allowances, one is impressed with the fact that the article criticized was not carefully read, and that there must have been an incomplete study of the Christian Science text-book. He fails to apply the canons of criticism and the laws of interpretation. These require that sentences should be studied in the light of the spirit and purpose of the author and interpreted by the scope of his completed thought, and by the meaning of the whole context. It is also necessary that the criticism should be based upon what may be seen from the viewpoint of the author. Coleridge has said that two-thirds of all misunder standing would be avoided* if disputants would agree as to the meaning of the words they used. The paper misrepre sents both the article and Science and Health. The quota tions for the most part violate the rules of criticism. The Christian Science standpoint of the spiritual and the abso lute is not considered at all. The spirit of the book has not been caught. Words are used out of their Christian Science significance and sentences torn out of their context. The assumptions inexcusably beg the question and are not founded on truth. His conclusions are drawn from false premises, misunderstanding, and misconstruction. To begin with the end of the paper, a personal statement is made that " this anonymous and unknown priest of the Protestant Episcopal Church must have been very unfortu nate in his experience, as a witness for Christ and a guide of souls, if the picture he here presents is drawn in any large degree from the results of his own ministry." He was. Because he was " very unfortunate " is the rea son why the article was written. It is practically a record of convictions drawn from his personal experiences. If his previous article on Protestantism and Christian Science, had been carefully read, it would have been seen that the picture of the Church therein presented could not have been drawn exclusively from experiences in a limited parish, but rather from the conditions of the average churches at large in their relations to the vital challenges of civilization. These experiences are extra-parochial. Dr. McKim's paper fails to show that the proposition in the article criticized was untenable, and to disprove the con</page><page sequence="3">724 THE NOETH AMEEICAN EEVIEW tention of the Christian Scientists that they have good reasons for their dissatisfaction. In his plea for the sub stantial adoption of the faith and practice of Christian Science, the writer regarded it as a social and religious phenomenon which seems to be a renaissance of the faith and practice of the Church as they were before its corrup tion by political affiliations and the placing of creed and dogma above life. Hundreds of thousands want to know about the truth of his statements which seem to them vital, and, if true, what the churches are going to do about it. Is it true or false that, as he affirmed, our failure to suc cessfully apply Christianity to existing conditions is inter fering with and preventing its function of regenerating the world, and that to a degree Christian Science is accomplish ing it? Have the facts presented to substantiate that posi tion been disproven? Is it true or false that the Church which stands for every thing normal does not prevent conditions largely social which wreck health, and that Christian Science in a measure is doing it? Was the evidence presented in behalf of this proposition valid? Is it true or false that while the glory of our Church is its missionary work, there is a deplorable lack of knowledge, interest, and appreciation concerning its extension, activity, and support? Do the data given sustain this affirmation? Is it true or not that Christian Scientists are all missionaries for their faith, and that the fruitage of their lives and practice is of the Holy Ghost, and that such fruitage is not common in the average church? Can their testimony be gainsaid? Has the paper disproved the posi tion that the theology of Christian Science is more scientific than that which is popularly accepted by the churches? Has it shown that the arguments made in support of it are not true? Note well that Christian Science has nothing which does not equally belong to our Church, because both are founded on the same confession of St. Peter and the same life of the Christ, and are manifestations of the same Kingdom of God. Christian Science has had healing for less than fifty years. The Church had it for nearly four hundred years and has expressed it whenever it had the spiritual channels to convey the power. But Christian Science has found the laws of healing, and to-day is applying them successfully by the power of the in</page><page sequence="4">A EEJOINDEE 725 dwelling God, and has shown how to make God available and operative for every need, so they have absolute faith in the teaching and healing of Jesus. The paper says, " Christian Science claims to be a new and improved edition of the Christian religion." It makes no such claim! It is the resurrection of the Christianity of Jesus the Christ with its full Gospel. This Gospel the Church has dissected in its science, desiccated in its theolo gies, desecrated in its materialism, and swathed in cere ments of dogmas. It is declared that Christian Science " professes to accept and interpret the Bible, yet it has put forth another Bible of its own for which it claims infallibility.'' The facts are that the founder of Christian Science attributed all her dis coveries to a constant and prayerful study of God's word, while hundreds of thousands of her followers make a daily study of the Bible and- its spiritual interpretation as re vealed by her insight into the spiritual significance of the contents of the spiritual Kingdom of God. The assertion that it has put forth another Bible of its own for which it claims infallibility is not true. No passage in Christian Science literature can be found in its support, and every Christian Scientist will deny it; nevertheless, seven times this paper refers to Science and Health as their Bible! The condemnation of Christian Science by the critic is based on its alleged disagreement from the Apostles' Creed, but when he wrote " now for the comparison between the Creed of Christianity and the Creed of the system which calls itself Christian Science," he showed that he had not read Christian Science literature or he would have known that it has no formal creed. He interprets from his own point of view and evidently cares not to find out the sense in which the words are used. It may be said that while they have no formulated doctrinal standard, they do accept every article of the Apostles' Creed. Only personal adherence to it can make it of practical value. Its reception in our thought always depends on its interpretation, and varies in our lives with the relative planes of our spiritual growth. The Apostles' Creed was formulated as a summary of belief for the candidates applying for membership in the Church, because of the lack of manuscripts of the Bible. As the Apostles had nothing to do with it, and it was not inspired, the Fathers modified it to suit their own ideas,</page><page sequence="5">726 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW some omitting the descent into Hell, others the communion of saints and the life everlasting. Because creeds were framed by the majority vote of Councils and set up as if inspired, impiety became rampant. No reliance was placed upon such creeds as statements of absolute truth. We have inherited some of these creeds which are ad mirable statements of the doctrinal beliefs of the Church, but to say that one is an apostate from Christianity if he questions the verity of any part of the creed of the Church is to insert a test and condition which are beyond those of Jesus and the Apostles. The Master stated, " He that is not against us is on our part "; " Whosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven, the same is my broth er and my sister and mother." How could anything be broader, more inclusive, and more intimate? He taught that if a man did not forsake all that he had (materially) he could not be His disciple. He founded His Church upon St. Peter's confession of faith, " Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." St. Paul's classification is scien tific?" If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His," however orthodox he may be theoretically. Conversely, it is true, if one have the spirit of Christ he is His, with all which that involves and implies. These es sentials of the Kingdom of God never can be subordinated to theological formulas or credal statements without sub verting the divine order. To condemn as apostates thou sands of people who are striving to have the mind of Christ and to do His will and thereby know of the doctrine that it is of God, because they do not seem to believe in a creed, is to put things desirable above things essential. Dr. McKim asserts, in proof of the corrections of his po sition, that Christian Science denies that God is our Father, and that He is the Creator of heaven and earth. When one considers the intelligence and religious life of these people together with the unnumbered declarations of the book to the contrary, it becomes apparent that such a statement is absurd. The quotations from Science and Health to sup port it are not given the meaning they attach to them. Why is it that the obvious meaning is ignored and that something is read into them to show that Christian Science denies the personality of God because it calls Him Princi ple? It must have been either intentional or the result of superficial reading when the critic uses Principle with a</page><page sequence="6">A REJOINDER 727 small " p," while in hundreds of places in the text-book it always appears with the capital " P." What is there in the word God as a word which makes Him more ador able than that which is contained in the word Principle, which is a synonym of Infinite Love, Spirit, Truth, Life? If Science and Health had been studied in order to know the truth, one would have understood it to teach that God is Infinite Personality. Mrs. Eddy says in Science and Health (p. 116): "As the words person and personal are commonly and ignorantly employed they often lead, when applied to Deity, to confused and erroneous conceptions of divinity and its distinction from humanity. If the term personality, as applied to God, means infinite personality, then God is infinite Person." Again the paper says, " If God is not a personal God, but only a principle, how can He be a Father?how can He love us?" This position is answered in the above statement as to the infinite personality of God. Must one have a human-form God in order to have love from Him and to love Him? Only divine Principle and infinite Personality can satisfy any intelligent basis for thinking about God. Emer son says, '' I deny personality to God because it is too little, not too much," meaning by it the idea formed of it by human sense. It is impossible to make a material image of a spiritual being. If God were an empty principle without life or love or truth, it would indeed be impossible to worship Him or to love Him or to think of Him as loving us. How grotesque it would be to affirm the omnipresence of a God in the anthropomorphic sense! Fancy it in the universe whose distances of worlds in space are measured by thousands of light-years as the measuring-rod, and science demanding that at every point within the horizon of solar systems God should be all the time upholding and governing with the involved omnipotence and omniscience. Such a conception, which seems to underlie the criticism, might do for an age when the Church taught that our suns were lanterns hung out in the skies by angels as soon as it became dark, but not for a day when science has shown us the glories re vealed in the material universe. The material senses, how ever, shut out the infinite glory of the real spiritual uni verse filled with infinite Personality, Principle, God. Only such a God is capable of being loved by all humanity at the same time and for ever. We cannot truly love ourselves</page><page sequence="7">728 THE NOETH AMEEICAN EEVIEW unless we love ourselves in God. What we really love in others is primarily the spiritual graces and charms, ideals and principles, which make up their true selfhood. When the object of love is God, we must love Him spiritually because He is Spirit. We must love with the mind because He is omniscient, and love with the heart because He is Love, the infinite Principle underlying every manifestation of infinite Life. If infinite Love as Principle cannot fulfil the conditions of the Fatherhood of God, how can one con stitute it out of a magnified human likeness? These Scien tists daily pray " Our Father." Faith in His fatherly care is expressed in their words, " Divine Love always has met and always will meet every human need.'' In the first line of the preface of their book their trust in His fatherly provision of good things is recorded in these words, " To those leaning on the sustaining infinite, to-day is big with blessings." The next position of the paper is that Christian Scientists deny that God is the maker of heaven and earth because they hold that i i matter is unreal.'' In Christian Science reality is used in the sense of that which is substance, which is of God, and therefore has permanence and freedom from dis cord and change. From the point of view of the spiritual and the absolute, nothing can be real which God has not made. From the relative standpoint of the senses, every thing seems to be real, but the seeming is not the reality, although the human sense so interprets it. To sense per ception, the horizon is a limit and there is nothing beyond; the sun rises, moves to the west, and sets, and sense supplies no evidence that the earth moves; the stars are nothing but points of light and do not shine during the day. To the carnal mind, the same is true respecting spiritual realities. As St. Paul puts it, " They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh." " To be carnally minded is death." '' The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned." As a matter of interpretation of phenomena, the things seen are tem poral, unreal, and are not made of things which do appear, and the things that are not seen are eternal, real. Science and Health (p. 472) says: " All reality is in God and His creation, harmonious and eternal. That which He created is good and He makes all that is made. Therefore the only</page><page sequence="8">A REJOINDER 729 reality of sin, sickness, or death is the awful fact that un realities seem real to human erring belief until God strips off their disguise. They are not true, because they are not of God." Mrs. Eddy further writes: " I believe in matter only as I believe in evil, that it is something to be denied and destroyed to human consciousness and is unknown to the Divine. We should subjugate it as Jesus did, by a dominant understanding of spirit " (Unity of Good, pp. 4, 5). Again, " Objects utterly unlike their original do not reflect that original, therefore matter, not being the reflection of spirit, has no real entity " (Science and Health, p. 506). " To ma terial sense the unreal is real until this sense is corrected by Christian Science." Experience illustrates this. Reality is not the spoken word; it is the truth which language con veys to sense because it reflects God, Truth. The work of art is not the reality, but the image in the mind of the artist is, because it reflects infinite Beauty. If Christian Scien tists defined that which to the senses seems real as the " actual," and that which seems real to spiritual percep tion as " absolute reality," this misunderstanding might be forestalled. Thousands have the idea that Christian Science denies the reality of sickness, hence from their ma terial viewpoint they justly ridicule Christian Science. Mrs. Eddy declares, however, that " Sickness is neither imaginary nor unreal, i. e., to the frightened false sense of the patient. Sickness is more than fancy; it is solid convic tion " (p. 460). The next point in the paper on which is founded the ac cusation that "Protestantism can only adopt Christian Science by abandoning and repudiating every fundamental doctrine for which it stands," is that Christian Science denies the next section of the Creed, " I believe in Jesus Christ His only Son, our Lord." Christian Scientists believe this thoroughly because it has become a fact of their experience through following Jesus Christ into God. It is more than theory with them. As to just how He came into the world they have no dogma, Look ing from the spiritual and absolute, it would stagger even the credulous to say that infinite Personality whose presence fills the universe was absent from this world until He ap peared in the likeness of sinful flesh. It is equally true that Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary, could not have had the consciousness that compelled the statement, " Before Abra</page><page sequence="9">730 THE NOETH AMEEICAN EEVIEW ham was I am." That was the consciousness of identity with Christ, the Logos, or Word, the perfect expression of infinite Mind. However men may dogmatize about how God became incarnate, the true Christian is satisfied that Christ is the God-man because he has taken up His cross and has grown into the spiritual realization that he has his being in God. Whatever theory may be held about human birth, one thing is sure, that only God is the creator of man. Science and Health, p. 29, says: The Holy Ghost overshadowed the pure sense of the Virgin mother with the full recognition that being is Spirit. Had His origin and birth been wholly apart from mortal usage, Jesus would not have been appre ciable to mortal man as " the Way." " The Virgin mother conceived this idea of God and gave to her ideal the name Jesus." Contrast these thoughts with that of the critic that Jesus was simply the ideal of the Virgin. It is charged that Christian Science denies that Jesus rose from the dead. Science and Health says: " The resur rection of the great demonstrator of God's power was the proof of. His final triumph over body and matter." " Our Master fully and finally demonstrated divine Science in His victory over death and the grave." The reappearing of Jesus was not the return of a spirit. He presented the same body He had before His crucifixion, and so glorified the supremacy of Mind over matter. His unchanged physical condition after what seemed to be death was followed by His exaltation above all material conditions, and this ex altation explained His ascension. In His final demonstra tion called the Ascension, which closed the earthly record of Jesus, He rose above the physical knowledge of His disciples and the material senses saw Him no more " (pp. 42, 45, 46). His resurrection was the victory over the mor tal belief that life can decay. His Ascension completed His struggle for freedom and He then realized the pure normal spiritual condition of man. That was what He came to do, and salvation means just this. If the critic had read Christian Science literature, how could he have said that it denied the death and resurrection and ascension which it so unequivocally affirms? Dr. McKim objects to the teaching that Jesus " healed the sick and destroyed sin by a metaphysical process." His instance of the raising of Lazarus was certainly not a physical process, but a metaphysical one. He claims that</page><page sequence="10">A REJOINDER 731 the life of Lazarus had been destroyed, but only by identi fying life which is essentially spiritual with the material body can one believe that the falling away of the body ex tinguishes the life. His thought would make individual life depend on matter. When Christian Science speaks of man it means the real spiritual man, made in God's likeness. It is declared that Martha's statement, " By this time he stinketh," is an evidence of death. But did " he " refer to Lazarus or to his body? Again, " If we consider now the mission of Jesus Christ we find in Christian Science another complete contradiction of the Christian Creed.'' It says:'' Christ came to save men, not from their sins, but from the false belief that they are sinners; that man is incapable of sin; that the only reality of sin is the awful fact that unrealities seem real." Accord ing to St. John, the real man is sinless, for he says of him, " Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin be cause he is born of God." Duns Scotus has said, " Since there is no real being outside of God, evil has no substantial existence. Perfection and reality are synonyms, hence absolute imperfection is synonymous with absolute unreality." In Miscellaneous Writings, p. 63, we find, " Jesus came to seek and to save such as believe in the reality of the unreal; to save them from this false belief that they might lay hold of eternal life, the great reality that concerns man, and understand the final fact that the Lord He is God, there is none beside Him." This is simply say ing that our salvation is a progress out from the false be liefs which were the basis of Adam's sin, and of the tempta tion of Jesus, and which are found in human experience to be the cause of all sin. The critic goes on to affirm that " it is not surprising, then, that we find no doctrine of the atonement." Strange criticism that in its ignorance will not see the vital belief in atonement which runs through all Christian Science teach ing and is the very foundation of its healing! It is charged that Christian Science puts the teaching that " reformation cancels crime " in place of the atonement. Mrs. Eddy says: " Science removes the penalty only by first removing the sin which incurs the penalty. This is my sense of divine par don which I understand to mean God's method of destroy ing sin. Another's suffering cannot lessen our own liabil</page><page sequence="11">732 THE NOETH AMEEICAN EEVIEW ity. Did the martyrdom of Savonarola make the crime of his implacable enemies less criminal?" (Science and Health, p. 40). Again the critic says, " Christian Science denies the per sonality of the Holy Ghost," If he means personality in the human sense, of course it does and should. Mrs. Eddy writes: " I have healed infidels whose only objection to this method was that I as a Christian Scientist believed in the Holy Spirit, while they, the patients, did not." (p. 359.) Leaving the Apostles' Creed as a standard of Truth to show the falsity of the alleged contradiction of Christian Science, he passes on to disclose some of the Christian Science claims and tenets which he says are untrue: 1. That " Disease is an illusion." If disease from the standpoint of the absolute and spiritual be real, then in heal ing Jesus was destroying what God had made. 2. That if men will faithfully follow the philosophy of Christian Science, " death will be obsolete. When we wake to the truth of Being, all error . . . sorrow, sin, and death will be unknown. Even the lightning will become harmless." Certainly, if men will do away with sinning these direct and indirect effects of sin will accordingly vanish. All church people believe in the Kingdom of Heaven, where sin and misery and death will be unknown. Christian Scientists be lieve that this spiritual Kingdom is here now, as Jesus said it was, and in proportion to our entrance into it we will be freed from every form of evil. St. Paul declares " the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." 3. The critic says, " If every one of them [cures] has really been wrought, that does not prove the truth of Chris tian Science; for our Saviour warns us that ' false Christs and false prophets shall show great signs and wonders, inasmuch as they shall deceive the very elect.' " The Bible states: " Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said unto Him, Art Thou He that should come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me " (and in the logical sufficiency of My argument).</page><page sequence="12">A REJOINDER 733 4. The last point raised is that " Christian Science does not exalt the power of prayer to heal the sick." There is not a Christian Scientist in the world who would not repudi ate this statement. It is the antipode of their belief. If the critic had read Science and Health, as he says he has, he would have found the very first sentence of the first chapter of that book to be, " Prayer that reclaims the sinner and heals the sick is an absolute faith that all things are pos sible to God?a spiritual understanding of Him, an unselfed love.'' From what has been written, is it true, in the judgment of the reader, that, as the critic affirms, Christian Science is opposed to the Church Creed? Has he proven his claim that Protestantism can only adopt Christian Science by abandoning and repudiating every fundamental doctrine for which it stands? Has he supported his contention that every article of the Apostles' Creed which expresses the faith of Christendom is denied by Christian Science? Has he shown the fundamental antagonism between the Creed which he says overthrows and Christian Science? By read ing the following points of what they believe, the reader's common sense will surely decide whether these hundreds of thousands of Christian Scientists are " apostate." 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life. 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We ac knowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness. 3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts. 4. We acknowledge Jesus's atonement as the evidence of divine, effica cious Love, unfolding man's unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death. 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and His resurrection served to uplift faith to understand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter. 6. And we solemnly promise to watch and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and to be merciful, just, and pure. A Chuechman.</page></plain_text>
