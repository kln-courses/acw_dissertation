The existence of the former senti- ment in the Western Hemisphere is easily substantiated by ethnology and archaeology. That ophiolatry is one of the most primeval of animal cults is more difficult to establish in brief review, since many complex factors related to anthropology, archaeology, and the evolution of primitive religious thought are involved. The strength of the evidence depends principally on comparisons of large numbers of cultures, both extinct and surviving, and ultimately can be derived mainly with reference to fundamental arguments pointing to the very great antiquity of serpent worship in the social evolution of man. I will elaborate upon this latter aspect elsewhere, but a few general remarks should be made to illustrate this antiquity: Venomous serpents occur almost everywhere between ap- proximately latitudes 650 north and 450 south-that is, every- where except in the perpetually cold regions. Their ability to survive seasonal extremes makes them a constant factor among widely variable faunas of which some other species may also be potentially dangerous to man. It is clear from archaeological records in diverse parts of the Old World that serpents were deified, or at least excited man's imagination, long before the lion acquired the symbolic importance more amply bestowed upon its Mesoamerican analogue, the jaguar, and before the bull was domesticated and became a cult animal. In the myths of the Australian Aborigines, marsupials, birds, and other animals are completely overshadowed by serpents. Hastings (1956) has compiled extensive worldwide surveys of primitive religious customs or popular beliefs involving reptiles, and Klauber (1972) gives numerous North American Indian examples. Serpents were likewise accorded a supreme place as both beneficent and malignant deities in cosmological and fertility myths and in the religious beliefs of high civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India. Among these Old World civilizations, overtones of serpent cults existed side by side with anthropomorphic deities by at least the 3d millennium B.C. The mythology and art of the Sumerians and of their Semitic successors exemplify this (Frankfort 1939, Parrot 1960), while the deities of the Hindus provide additional, living proof (Vogel 1926). It is important to recall this background in view of the claims of some diffusionists that certain Mesoamerican archaeological relics, primarily religious and from a quite late stage of human history, bear stylistic resemblances to the religious art and architecture of India and Southeast Asia. Indeed, they are adduced as indicators of overseas cultural contacts. Even if this were true, Mesoamerican ophiolatrous beliefs cannot have been part of such diffusion, for the characteristics of the serpent cult in pre-Columbian civilized Mesoamerica are in all essen- tial respects precisely akin to those typical of the most remote and backward aboriginals everywhere else in the Americas and differ fundamentally from the serpent lore and art of India and Southeast Asia. It can be shown, furthermore, that, in the Americas, man's veneration or mythicizing of other animal species has had the effect of sometimes obscuring, but rarely totally erasing, the significance primevally attached to the serpent. The severity of this process doubtless was aggravated by the passage of time as primitive religions became increasingly diversified, and it obviously varied from culture to culture. More importantly, it was shaped by climatic and biological environmental factors. Those regional animals which were indispensable in man's sub- sistence economy or familiar to him as either benign or rapa- cious members of the local fauna tended to creep into myths 1 This article represents part of the research carried out during the tenure of a generous travel award from the University of Con- necticut Research Foundation.

The whale, the salmon, the coyote, the crocodile, the bat, the marine tortoise, the condor, the jaguar, and the llama, among others, define the vast range of environments where the serpent has encountered, as it were, cultic "competition." That the serpent has survived this competition in widely separated regions of the Americas over a very long span of time is a commentary on the deeply rooted psychological factors im- pelling veneration of an animal of little or no economic value. The explanation, of course, is that fear of the deadly surrepti- tiousness of a few species of serpents has earned for the entire family an awesome reputation and ascriptions of all manner of supernatural powers. Thus there is much common ground relating to ophiolatry in the two hemispheres. The question of the origins of serpent cults in the Western Hemisphere, both in time and in place, therefore assumes importance for the prehistoric religious beliefs of all aboriginal Americans. MESOAMERICA AND THE ALLEGED ASIAN CONTACTS From time to time, archaeologists and art historians have been impressed by similarities in the motifs represented, on the one hand, in the relics of Asian cultures and, on the other, those of Meso- and South America. For example, certain motifs from the Shang period in China (1450-1054 B.C.) and especially the late Chou period (ca. 5th century B.C.) resemble those of the Chavin culture of Peru. Heine-Geldern (1966a:280) stated that most of the artistic correspondences suggest Peruvian relations with China between approximately 600 and 200 B.C.; relations of Mesoamerica with India and Indianized Southeast Asia were believed to have occurred from the early post-Christian centuries up to about the 8th century. Willey (1974:329), never- theless, is properly cautious in reminding us of the absence of any concrete evidence of actual links between these regions, since "not a single object of undisputed Asiatic manufacture has ever been found in pre-Columbian contexts in the middle latitudes of the Americas." Nor, one might add, have pre- Columbian artifacts been found in Asia so far. These factors reduce the force of the conjecture that the contacts were moti- vated by trade, and they are inconsistent with the degree of intimacy of human dealings implicit in arguments that rely on stylistic correspondences between pre-Columbian relics and their supposed Asian archetypes. Almost every argument invoking trans-Pacific contacts on the basis of artistic analogies is related to a relatively recent pre-Columbian period and focusses mainly upon Mesoamerica. The literature which espouses affinities between the Hindu and Buddhist cultures of India and Southeast Asia and Meso- america has recently been summarized by Gardini (1974). Ekholm (1953) hypothesizes that such Asian influences were exerted "somewhere in the border of the present Maya area ... in Chiapas, Tabasco, or Campeche." It is a cultural area he calls "Complex A," whence, he states, these artistic features spread to other ceremonial centers, to Chichen Itz'a and to Tollan, influencing much of the latter's style. Ekholm assigns a period of ca. A.D. 700 to "Complex A," basing his compari- sons with the Hindu-Buddhist cultures of South Asia on such features as serpent columns, sun discs, the phallic cult, trefoil arches, "lotus" thrones, and several others, including even comparisons of the manner in which important personages are depicted seated on thrones. Some of the resemblances are noteworthy, but, to me, seem superficial. Other comparisons, as indicators of cultural in- fluences, strain credulity severely, besides shunning the possi- bility that ethnically unrelated people may be capable of in- dependent imagination and embellishment of the simplest deco- rative designs, such as meanders and spirals. Comparisons of artistic conceptualizations of human beings emerging from the mouths of serpentine chimaerical monsters (makara) of Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture with Mesoamerican equivalents fall, I believe, in this same dubious category. Heine-Geldern (1966:288 and fig. 14) compares a statuette of the elephant- headed Hindu god, Ganesa, from Viet Nam (Champa) with a figurine from El Salvador and a Oaxacan relief. He sees paral- lels between these specimens in such features as the shape of the head and trunk, though, in the Oaxacan example in par- ticular, the resemblance is far-fetched. He even stresses the significance of such a detail, perhaps fortuitous, as a depression over the eye, while ignoring the elephant's characteristic fea- ture, unfailingly emphasized in Hindu-Buddhist art, but never portrayed in Mesoamerican-the animal's fanlike ears. Admit- tedly, art is rarely borrowed wholesale. Nor is the usefulness of artistic criteria now under question. Nevertheless, the danger of subjectivity in such comparisons is obvious: Which of the details is one to select, and which may one ignore, when seeking cultural affinities? Even if occasional instances like these are not seen as merely coincidental, and even if the Hindu-Buddhist examples given by Ekholm and Heine-Geldern are not recognized as divorced from their wider cultural context, weaknesses still remain in their arguments and similar others. Some of these are pointed out by Rands (1953a). The view that Mesoamerican civilizations show the influence of Indian Asia overlooks the facts that many of the key artistic elements of religious nature, such as the serpent and jaguar motifs, were anticipated more than a millennium and a half earlier than A.D. 700 in Mesoamerica itself and that the socio- anthropological impulses which inspired their production sure- ly must have prevailed still further back in time. I shall sub- stantiate this below. If one singles out for comparison the cult of the serpent, so deeply integral an element in both Indian and Mesoamerican religions, the discordances are glaring. The serpent is associated with rain and moisture in both these cultures. This feature, like many other popular superstitions and cults, such as the phallic, is of worldwide prevalence. The similarity in this respect, how- ever, is less revealing than the differences. In India, the asso- ciation with rain is far less emphatic than in the Western Hemisphere; almost everywhere in the Americas, the ritual connections of the serpent with the weather, rain, lightning, fertility of the soil, and the deities controlling these are of pro- nounced importance. On the other hand, the serpent's connec- tion with human fecundity is almost invariably undetectable. There are in the Americas no special deities, whether fully ser- pent in form or partly anthropomorphic, who preside primarily over human reproduction as mightily as do the chthonic fer- tility goddesses Mudamma and Manasa of India. We may illustrate the Mesoamerican attitudes with two ex- amples concerning Quetzalcoatl, who is ordinarily a deity of varied functions (Armillas 1947:164; Anders 1963:99ff). Quet- zalcoatl is doubtless euhemeristic in origin, cast sometimes in human and sometimes in serpent form. There is in the Codex Laud a picture of Xochiquetzal, goddess of flowers and vegeta- tion, naked, tempting Quetzalcoatl into intercourse; in the Codex Vindobonensis the goddess Tlazolteotl appears with a similar purpose. In both these situations Quetzalcoatl is por- trayed as a symbol of masculine sexual power, but is not cast in the sacred capacity of begetter of offspring. He fertilizes Tlazolteotl (a deity of "unclean" sexual behaviour rather than of childbirth), but only after he has lost all powers of reflection following a drunken stupor induced by pulque (Burland 1967: 162). The second example concerns Eh6catl, the so-called ava- tar2 of Quetzalcoatl. There is an anthropomorphic image of 2 The term "avatar" as used in this Mexican context is not really warranted unless one insists on perpetuating the highly dubious notion of Hindu cultural influences. In Hindu Puranic myths, ava- 430 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS Ehecatl at Chichen Itza. It shows him seated on his buttocks, knees folded, penis erect. He obviously personifies a phallic cult; yet, there are no associated serpent motifs, no suggestions that the serpent has a symbolic role in human fecundity. The phallic cult, as Folan (1970:79-81) states, did not exist in any form in pre-Toltec Yucatan, i.e., the cult was not in- digenous among the Maya, though it may have existed among the Itza. It was imported into Yucatan by Toltec invaders. In what once was the principal temple complex in their capital of Tollan, an important serpent goddess, Coatlicue, worshipped also by the Chichimecs, Huastecs, and Aztecs, was enshrined as an earth goddess, a deity of agricultural bounty and not of human fertility. Tlaloc and Chac fertilized the soil rather than barren women. That these rain deities were manifestly ophidian early in their evolution is amply evident from archaeology (Garcia Payon 1975:142-66). Similarly, Chicomec6atl (Xilo- nen), patroness of the maize crop among the Aztecs, is some- times depicted with seven interlaced serpents issuing from her neck in place of a human head. To this day, the Christianized Totonacs of the Gulf Coast of Mexico carry effigies of serpents during dances invoking rain. They represent Kitsis luwa ("five serpent"), a possible analogue of Chicomec6atl (Ichon 1969: 121-23). By contrast, in Hindu mythology, an elephant, or horses, are the animals associated with Indra, the principal Vedic god who controls rain and the weather. Indeed, his chief opponent, Vrtra or Ahi (literally "serpent"), is the demon who causes drought (Verma 1973). The Rg Veda (I, 32 [1,2,6-14] and I,32[3,4]) refers to Vrtra as the "first-born of the serpents" and to Indra as the victorious serpent-slayer. Serpents and serpent divinities and semi-divinities in India almost invariably symbolize sexual attractiveness and human procreation. Temptingly beauteous serpent-maidens and hand- some serpent-princes weave their way through Hindu mythol- ogy, changing their form at will to seduce ordinary mortals. Their true serpent nature is manifest only during sexual inter- course and during sleep. Figure 1 illustrates the typical artistic expression of a composite, human-serpent couple (Ndga and Nagini) locked in sexual embrace. The concupiscence they symbolize expresses little more than the desire to bear children. That women petition serpent effigies and deities, and even live cobras, for children attests to this belief in rural South India even today. In the votive stone slab in figure 2, a serpent couple and their offspring express this eloquently. Vogel (1926) has recounted the popular legends and myths, and I (Mundkur 1976a, 1976b) have discussed the religious and archaeological background of beliefs concerning human fertility in western Asia and in India. tars are morphologically radically varied forms temporarily assumed by the god Visnu to outwit the forces of evil during different epochs. Visnu's function (as preserver of the balance of nature, favoring gods over demons) does not change. Even the god Shiva's aspects or those of Maha Devi, the universal goddess, are not usu- ally termed avatars. Thus there is far less reason to apply the term to Ehecatl. He is, like Quetzalc6atl, anthropomorphic, and as- sumes the epithet Ehecatl and a mask or muzzle only to identify his change of function-as god of the wind, altered from Quetzal- c6atl's normal association with the planet Venus.

Both have rich traditions of astronomy and strong concerns about time and its cyclical nature, astrology, numerol- ogy, and divination. Yet, in India, except that the concept of time cycles is symbolized by a circle formed by a serpent biting its own tail, calendrical involvement of the serpent is very limited. It does not at all compare with the frequency of reptil- ian motifs in the twenty-day and thirteen-day periods of the Aztec system of Tonalpauhalli, in which serpents of different identity are associated with the gods who dominate these pe- riods (Burland 1967). The "serpent number dates" of the Maya (Smiley 1970:162) and the characteristic association of fire- serpents (xiuhcoatl) with the cyclic, calendric number fifty-two, as in Chichimec architecture at Tenayuca, are also distinctly Mesoamerican conceptions (Palacios 1935 :249-53). In addition to the special potencies residing in the mystic numerals thirteen, twenty, and fifty-two, the number four had special significance. We shall see below that it was employed consistently and in varied ways by uncivilized tribes through- out the Americas, again with serpent associations, notably in relation to the sun, sun deities, and cardinal directions. In civilized Mesoamerica the amalgamation of solar and serpent cults is exemplified by the great pyramid at Tenayuca (Caso 1935), and in sun-disc motifs which personify the Aztec sun god, Tonatiuh, the cardinal points are consistently indicated by four rays in the form of bifid serpent tongues (Beyer 1921:134ff). By contrast, in Indian Asia, one, and not four, is the number of divinity, of the linga (phallic) cult, and of the sun. The re- current mystic number is three. The animal associated with Sfirya, the sun god, is the horse, not the serpent; the god, or the sun itself, is imagined as moving in a chariot drawn by seven horses (Gopinatha Rao 1914, vol. 1: 414); Surya (literally "sun") is synonymous with "twelve," an allusion to its twelve forms (Apte 1890:1135). The number thirteen is inauspicious and hence ignored, while twenty and fifty-two merit no special recognition (Das 1913). Thus the serpent lore of the Hindus and Buddhists, like their other cultural traditions, differs wholly in tone and substance from that of Mesoamerica. It is little won- der, then, that the religious stimuli for the artistic depiction of reptiles in Indian Asia were at all historical periods distinctly unrelated to those which inspired the Mesoamerican artist. BLOOD GROUPS AND THE MIGRATION OF CULTS It is difficult to envision overseas cultural influences without actual population shifts, even small-scale, or sufficient domi- nance of the religious beliefs of one ethnic group over another if these are to lead to significant parallels in styles of art and architecture. The cultural colonies established in the early Christian centuries in Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia by Hindus and Buddhists from India illustrate such parallels clear- ly, not only through their art, but also by the names of places, deities, and persons (Coomaraswamy 1927, Rawson 1967). Such is conspicuously not the case in Mesoamerica. Still, can one dismiss entirely the possibility that a primitive animal cult might have been imported so long ago that sheer lapse of time could explain the divergences we have noted? Perhaps the single most important evidence opposing the surmised trans-Pacific imports of culture from Indian Asia, not only at so late a period as the mid-lst millennium A.D., but even far earlier, comes from human genetics. The subject is generally ignored by those diffusionists whose theories depend primarily on artistic criteria. It has the utmost relevance for our theme inasmuch as it indicates the extremely long stretch of time elapsed since aboriginal Americans ceased to have genetically or culturally meaningful contacts with the Old World. This situation was abruptly altered only after 1492 by the Spanish conquests. This argument, summarized recently by Stewart (1973:51-55), complements the currently accepted view that the peopling of the Western Hemisphere took place from Northeast Asia across the land bridge constituted by Berin- gia. The evidence is based on the distribution of blood groups among the world's population, and we should examine it briefly before resuming discussion of the cult of the serpent. The genes which determine the inheritance of blood-groups A, B, AB, and 0 occur in characteristically different frequencies in different parts of the world. They are unaffected by climate. Blood-groups B and 0 are of particular relevance. The fre- quencies of B in extensive parts of India and Southeast Asia, as elsewhere in Asia, are as high as 30%. There is a drop, but to no less than 10%, only in northeastern Siberia. Only among the descendants of pre-Columbian populations of America and among the obviously unrelated Australian Aborigines does the frequency of group B drop to between 5% and 0. The least acculturated American Indians, with few exceptions, possess group 0 in frequencies of 80% to 100%, the remaining being mostly A, traceable to European admixture. "So often," states Stewart (p. 52), "does the percentage of group 0 approach 100% in the remote populations of Central and South America [as also in North America] that the total absence of A, B, and AB here, at least in late prehistoric times, can be accepted as highly probable." The explanation of this is not that it casts doubt on the Asiatic origin of indigenous Americans, but that the unique deficiency of blood-group B in the Western Hemi- sphere in pre-Columbian times signifies that this blood group arose in Asia by mutation only after the migrations into North America across Beringia had ceased. Blood-group 0, of course, was imported during these unidirectional migrations. This is evident from the fact that present-day populations of north- eastern Asia still carry group-O genes in frequencies increasing from 50% to 65% in North China and Manchuria to 75% among the aborigines of northeastern Siberia (Mourant, Kopec, and Domaniewska-Sobczak 1958:270). Such important data reveal the tight genetic isolation under which the descendants of the earliest migrants developed in the Americas. This isolation surely fostered a conservative dif- ferentiation of their primitive beliefs, the adoption of totemic animals and the evolution of religious systems around them. Its time scale, based on radiocarbon-dated human fossil re- mains (Berger et al. 1971), takes us at least some 24,000 years back. The few centuries after the Christian era during which ready-made Indian and Southeast Asian traits of religious architecture are believed to have been transplanted into Meso- america are trivial in comparison. Proponents of such trans- Pacific influences seem to overlook or minimize the gravity of a long period of independent religious evolution in Meso- america and throughout the hemisphere in general. Moreover, their views are rebutted by the blood-group data. Those few centuries after the presumed Asian contacts ca. A.D. 700 are remote enough from the Spanish conquest (by about 825 years) that they are not trivial in terms of human genetics: blood-groups A and B are dominant over group 0, but not inter se. This explains the rapid inroads made especially by the A group which predominates among Spaniards-to the extent of between about 40% and 50% in the southern and central Spaniards who initially colonized Mexico-in the prin- cipal urban centers of Mexico in effectively much less than 430 years. These statements assume that no significant miscegena- tion involving Spaniards could have occurred prior to the con- quest of Tenochtitlan in 1521. The mainly mestizo population of Mexico City comprised, in 1951, 28.64% group-A individu- als (Mourant, Kopec, and Domaniewska-Sobczak 1958:197). If group-B genes had been introduced from Asia into Meso- america ca. A.D. 700, they would have hybridized and diffused in the populations around the major ceremonial centers of the Toltecs and Mayas as easily as the group-A genes, appreciably suppressing the phenotypic expression of group-O genes before the Spanish conquest. As we have seen, in terms of even the present-day blood-group frequencies this is far from being the situation. 432 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS The value of arguments based on blood-group distributions is occasionally questioned (Coon 1965:283; Garn 1957). Scep- tics surmise that the 1 00% prevalence of group 0 among pure- blooded American aborigines may have resulted from the sur- vival value it afforded in protecting its possessors against dis- eases, primarily syphilis and yaws, once believed to be American in origin.3 Such views necessitate the highly improbable as- sumption that these diseases once attained near-saturation levels of incidence practically everywhere in the Americas, to the extent that they selectively eliminated those persons who carried the dominant A or B genes. These views are also op- posed by modern medical research involving several related human treponematoses whose worldwide distribution in mild, endemic form is traceable to at least about 7000 B.C. Contrary to a long-held belief, there is considerable circumstantial evi- dence, from epidemiological reconstructions based on historical events and studies of lesions in human skeletal remains, that virulent, mutant strains of treponemes like those causing vene- real syphilis originated in the Old World itself. The first of these mutants may have appeared in about 3000 B.C. in South- west Asian urban centers, followed, in Europe, by an even more virulent mutant treponeme perhaps in the late 15th century. Coinciding in appearance with the period of European colonial expansion and geographical exploration, this severe European syphilis was viewed as an import from the Americas, whereas, in fact, it was being spread throughout the "trepone- mally uncommitted world," including the New World, during the 16th and subsequent centuries (Hackett 1963:23ff; Hudson 1958). There remains the question of possible intentional diffusion by man of plant species or domesticated animals as evidence that contacts with Asia existed in pre-Columbian times. The dates in this regard, most of which fall in the 2d millennium A.D., are highly controversial, as are the basic precepts; the significance of linguistic "links" or "parallels" in art motifs, some of them allegedly traceable to the Mesopotamia of over 4,000 years ago, are equally controversial, even dismissible in the sense that they can have had no determinative roles in either the formative or the efflorescent periods of the civiliza- tion of the American Indian. The present confused state of knowledge is apparent in views expressed in a recent symposium and in the literature it summarizes (Riley et al. 1971). The origins of ophiolatry in the Americas transcend these particular diffusionist views. Primarily because of the blood- group distribution data, we must look within the Western Hemisphere for information which, in the context of man's re- ligious development, is more basic than, and relatable to an era long preceding, the artistic expressions of the Classic periods of Meso- and South American civilizations. "We can only speak adequately of one Mesoamerican civilization," states Bernal (1971:50). "Such expressions as Maya civilization or Aztec civilization I consider misleading, since both the Maya and the Aztecs among many others are only part of a larger whole, even if particularly distinctive in different ways and moments; both have been to a considerable degree fashioned by this larger whole." In other words, there is only one Meso- american civilization, as there is only one Andean civilization, though distinct societies or cultures are recognizable within each. I agree entirely with Bernal and would, indeed, go a step further. Whether civilized or "primitive," aboriginal societies throughout the Americas were and often continue culturally to be "only parts of a larger whole" in that they share, to a very striking degree, certain basic attitudes towards serpents. These attitudes seem to have been fashioned in very remote antiquity by much the same factors important in the differen- tiation of the cults of other animals. They were in each case probably related to a particular animal totem or totems pos- sessed by the earliest human groups crossing Beringia as immi- grants to the Western Hemisphere and moulded by the climate and the fauna of the terrain where these groups eventually settled. This, initially, was the northwestern Pacific region of North America. As man continued his migrations far and wide from this focal area, the influence of changing climate, vegeta- tion, and animal life inevitably encouraged diversification, modification, or abandonment of the initially held tribal myths and religious beliefs. The representative examples given below indicate that in this historical drama, in contrast to the situation almost every- where in southwestern, southern, and southeastern Asia, the serpent played hardly any role as a symbol of human fecundity. It was, on the other hand, almost invariably associated with moisture, the sun, and the number four or the four cardinal directions. Because these beliefs are all rooted in fear of the animal, and because they are so remarkably alike in essential features and so persistent, the serpent must have been among the earliest and most important of cult animals of this hemi- sphere. The examples show that the place of other animals in myths and religious beliefs was for the most part as transient as the regional settlements man established on his southward and eastward routes from the Pacific coastal regions of North America. No other animal cult was powerful enough to com- pletely negate the importance primevally given to the serpent. UNITY IN DIVERSITY Two prefatory remarks are necessary before I exemplify the viewpoint just outlined and show how northeastern Asia fits into the picture: First, we must recognize that no existing society or any of its precursors within the past, say, 4,000 years was exactly like any society emerging in the New World at the dawn of its hu- man history. The usefulness of ethnographic parallels and archaeology as mirrors of the remote past is valued differently by different scholars. The relevance of starting with a facet of human cultural behavior and then studying it from both ethno- graphic and archaeological viewpoints is believed by some to be not analogy, but a unified approach-the only one possible- in reconstructing prehistoric societies. The subject is reviewed by Orme (1974). Whatever one's theoretical position may be in this regard, my examples are not of the same class as mar- riage and kinship customs and other such fragile social criteria. Rather, they reflect fear, adoration, and superstition involving cult animals in relatively recent or existing societies. No matter how varied they may be in details of expression, in principle they are basic behavioral attitudes which can be assumed to have remained unchanged since extremely remote times. Second, it is necessary to show a certain consistency of occur- rence in the New World of particular facets of the serpent cult- its symbolic connection primarily with the weather and fer- tility of the soil, the sun cult, and the cardinal points rather than (as is general in southern Asia) with human fertility. Ex- tensive documentation of this consistency is obviously unfea- sible here, especially with the purpose of underscoring possible exceptions. Isolated cases of such may of course exist, but, after a meticulous search of the literature, I am aware of hardly any exceptions involving large or important ethnic groups which seriously threaten the validity of my viewpoint. The Aleuts and related Eskimos seem to show no trace whatever of beliefs concerning serpents, but they are very specialized products of an extremely harsh environment uninhabited by reptiles. If ever the ancestors of these peoples gave the serpent any impor- tance, memories of it no longer persist. The Northwest (Pacific) Coast Indians are ethnically one of 3 The far more rapidly spread diseases, smallpox, typhus, tuber- culosis, and measles, were unknown in the Americas before Euro- pean colonization.

They comprise several tribes, of which I shall consider briefly only the Kwakiutl (Boas 1935, Locher 1932), the Nootka (Drucker 1951), the Haida (Gunther 1966), and the Bella Coola (Mcllwraith 1948). All inhabit a maritime or riverine environment rich in fish and game, and this has moulded them into hunters and fishermen rather than settled agriculturists. They share essentially the same legends and re- ligious myths, and the animals which dominate these reflect this environment. The deer, the whale, the salmon, the thun- derbird, the sea otter, the squid, the wolf, the raven, and the bear-all familiar or useful creatures-are typical. Yet it is the serpent, the mythical sisiutl, portrayed with a double head and occasionally with feathers or sometimes even in its aspect as a salmon, which occupies a key position in their mythology and superstitions. This is all the more remarkable because ser- pents are rare and venomous species totally absent (Drucker 1951:154) in the cold climate of Vancouver Island, where the Nootka and Kwakiutl dwell. The basic attitudes I have mentioned are all there: The Kwa- kiutl believe that the mere sight of the sisiutl (which is to say, of any serpent) causes fainting. Anyone who sees it must bite his tongue and spit blood. Thunderbirds turn into stone if they touch its dead body. Game is petrified the instant it is shot down by an arrow to which sisiutl scales are tied. Even canoes are transformed into stone in the presence of the sisiuti. Its meat is poisonous, and its sight alone produces bodily contor- tions. Its clotted blood turns one's skin into stone at the very touch. It is bad luck to touch even the stone on which the ser- pent has lain. The list of trepidations can be lengthened: For the Nootkans, small harmless snakes evoke dread. Chance sight of them is considered dangerous, for with lightning speed they penetrate the unlucky observer through his bodily orifices. The Bella Coola have a similar aversion to live serpents and believe that they enter one's stomach, multiply there, and rupture it, or are released through vomit. Sisiutl and live serpents alike are totally dissociated from any symbolic role in human fer- tility. In fact, to prevent miscarriage a pregnant woman must avoid their gaze. Though the mythical sisiutl is a supernatural spirit with a watery abode, the Northwest Coast Indians are exceptional in not assigning it or its live serpent brethren a symbolic role in rain making. This is surely a consequence of their being largely nonagricultural. If rain is desired, Bella Coola rites prescribe washing the penis of a large buck and throwing it in the ocean, saying, "Please, may it be as it was when you held intercourse" -an illusion to the rainy season in October, when deer mate. One might assume the sun to be not critically important in the lives of nonagriculturists, but it is the most obvious attribute of Atquntam, the supreme deity of the Bella Coola and the creator of man and animals. Though there is no specific men- tion of serpents in connection with the sun, overtones of such are contained in the tribe's important sun dance and suggested by the belief that the sisiutl was created in the beginning of time. The Kwakiutl specifically assert that the sun wears a double-headed serpent mask. Among the Haida, the shaman's wands are decorated with serpent motifs and sometimes with the thunderbird. In the Nootkan klukwana, a sacred dance, the lightning-serpent is represented in the "belt of the thunderbird," which is supposed to be the serpent's tongue. The wolf dance or klukwalle (Ernst 1952) is an initiation ritual common among all Northwest Coast Indians. Despite its great importance, it is believed to have originated no more than about 250 years ago. In the wolf-dance of the Quillayute, neighbours of the Nootka, the shaman dances with a rattle-wand decorated, not with a wolf motif, but with that of a double-headed sea-serpent. The wand is grasped sym- bolically by both ends. This dance occurs after four days of ceremonies (specifically, on the fifth night). American Indian tribes everywhere generally attach much importance to the number four, particularly in linking it with the cardinal direc- tions and with numerous mystical objectives. Boas (1935:113) recorded a very lengthy list of Kwakiutl beliefs founded upon the use of the number four. The Hopi of the southwestern U.S.A. have a snake dance, fortunately described in great detail by competent observers in the 19th century (Fewkes 1897,1900; Voth 1903), before many of its complex features were lost through commercialization. Its rituals and ceremonies reflect, in essentially the same way as among the Northwest Coast Indians, regard for the serpent as a creature of supernatural power. There are, however, two differences: the Hopi cultivate the soil for maize, and their arid region, besides being dependent on seasonal rains, is the abode of many venomous serpents. It is difficult to summarize adequately the extremely elabo- rate Hopi ceremonies and their emotional significance. The ambivalent attitude towards serpents is apparent in the fact that, even during this period of intense celebrations invoking this animal's supernatural power to produce rain, there is no veneration of an image of the serpent conceived as a deity. Rather, the animal is closely associated with the sun at its zenith; it also symbolizes man's ancestors, and accordingly is treated deferentially. I shall mention here only those aspects of the ceremonies which pertain to our theme. The ceremonies involved the participation of a very select fraternity of priests and young helpers and began with an expe- dition to collect serpents. These men were consumed by the re- ligious fervor the occasion demanded; they were skilled in the handling of poisonous serpents, as they amply and fearlessly demonstrated during the prolonged preparations for the dance and then during the dance itself, when undefanged serpents were held in the mouth; and they were fortified by the belief that magical herbal potions and charms could ward off the effects of venomous bites. Yet they were very cautious and ad- mitted to nervousness during this initial collecting expedition. Fear and consternation also gripped the lay observers of the dance, who would scatter excitedly when a serpent accidentally escaped among the crowd. The ceremonies were dominated throughout by the repeated use made of the mystic number four. Sand paintings showing four differently colored zigzags (stylized serpents) rising from symbolic clouds represented lightning (fig. 3). The priest- dancers made four circuits of the dance plaza. The full course of the festivities was twenty days, of which only nine were for ceremonies. These nine had a nomenclature suggestive of a division into two groups of four days each. These nine days of ceremonies plus the ensuing four days of frolic made up the mystic number thirteen. As already noted, the numerals thir- teen and twenty also had mystical significance in the Tonal- pauhalli calendrical system of civilized Mesoamerica, with four FIG 3 papt N Mi(e 434 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS and five having importance in other respects-the association with serpents being prominent in all cases. Five of the twenty days in the calendars of the Maya and the Mexica are identified with reptilian glyphs. Of these, the fifth is Coatl (serpent) and the fourth Cuetzpallin (lizard), the other three being tied to deities with reptilian attributes. Moreover, the present heaven and earth constitute the "fifth sun" of the Mexica, revived by Quetzalc6atl and Huitzilopochtli after the destruction of the four suns they had initially created. The Hopi serpent dance concluded with the priests marching out of the village to release the serpents. This departure took place amid a veritable torrent of spittle, directed upon the priests by the crowd of rooftop bystanders in symbolic anticipa- tion of the ceremony's successful entreaty of the skies for a heavy downpour. The serpents, released in the four cardinal directions, were believed to go to the house of the sun in the west. Among the Cherokee (Mooney 1900) of the rich woodlands of the southeastern U.S.A., serpents and the sun were less con- genially associated. In one of their myths, the sun is a female who hates people (because they make ugly faces when looking at her) and in turn is hated by them. They send venomous ser- pents to kill the sun-surely an act more indicative of the power of the serpent than of any permanent disrespect of the sun. Ser- pents also occur very frequently in their myths and supersti- tions as "supernaturals" intimately connected with rain and the thundergods. Serpents were regarded with mingled fear and reverence and addressed respectfully as "grandfather," "brother," or "uncle." Rattlesnakes were never harmed; they were referred to only in euphemistic or circumlocutory terms, such as "the admirable one," and a bite was announced as a "scratch from a briar." The mere sight of a rattlesnake was believed to produce an eye affliction resulting in ultrasensitivity to light. The inordinately deep-seated Cherokee terror of rattlesnakes is apparent from their attitudes towards even dreams of snakebite. In such cases, the medicine-man treated the dreamer as though he had actually been bitten. Herbal decoctions were rubbed upon the part of the body where the "patient" dreamt he had been bitten; the entire complex set of incantations used for cases of actual rattlesnake bite was re- cited four times, the medicine-man on each occasion breathing upon the "wound" four times, and finally the "patient" was secluded for four days. Toothache was believed to be prevent- able by grasping a greensnake by its head and tail and biting four times along its midsection, gently and without hurting the animal (Mooney and Olbrechts 1932:176). The Iroquoian and Muskogean tribes of the northern and southern regions of the eastern U.S.A. conducted elaborate magico-religious games as part of their human-fertility rites. Natural forces and spirits such as the sun, moon, trees, etc., were invoked, but serpents, though venerated in other respects, were not at all involved (Salter 1974). Such examples can be multiplied throughout the hemisphere. Even when serpents ap- pear on occasion in myths pertaining to childbirth, they do not emblematize human fecundity so much as the general esteem they command. Among the civilized Chibcha of Colombia, serpents, com- monly associated with lakes and ponds, overshadow all others as cult animals. In Chibcha creation myth, the goddess Bachu6 or Fura-choque ("benevolent female") emerges from a lake with her young son, who, when he matures, marries her. They have four to six children at each birth, and thus the earth is populated. Exhorting their children to live peaceably, Bachue and her son-husband reenter the lake as two serpents. The im- portant point is that it is as humans and not as serpents that they populate the earth. Furthermore, Bachue is looked upon as a goddess not of human fertility, but of agricultural bounty (Kroeber 1946:908.). Among the Cubeo of the Brazilian Amazon forest, any con- nections of serpents with childbirth are inspired by fear: the land boa rapes women and they give birth to reptiles; women in labor must avoid rivers or the anaconda will kill them; a woman's death in childbirth is attributed to her having copu- lated with a boa (Goldman 1963). Similar beliefs are held in western Amazonia by the Jibaros, who, incidentally, regard the rainbow as no more than a huge boa in the air, whose gaze must be avoided by menstruating women lest they become pregnant by him (Karsten 1935:375). The archaeological relics of the Chaco-Santiaguen-a culture of Argentina comprise large numbers of terracotta funerary figurines, believed to represent anthropo-ornitho-ophidian di- vinities. Their bird aspect is the least appreciable and the ophid- ian very pronounced. They are cylindrical, with one flattened- flared end representing the head and the other terminating in a pair of legs. In many cases small conical human breasts iden- tify them as female. They are characteristically lacking in the organs of generation and never portray pregnancy or even sug- gest it. Their funerary association suggests, on the other hand, death, since some breastless specimens are portrayed lying in coffins or criblike enclosures and possibly denote propitiatory or votive offerings to the female ophidian divinity (Wagner and Wagner 1934:119-28). Aside from a rare exception or two, it is doubtful that among the vast quantities of archaeological material from the Americas human pregnancy or the male and female generative organs are overtly associated with the serpent. In the art of a region otherwise rich in serpent and other zoomorphic motifs, the ceramics of Oaxaca illustrate this rarity conspicuously: the very few known pots whose spouts combine phallic and ophidian form surely reflect the artist's sense of humor rather than an institutionalized myth (Caso, Bernal, and Acosta 1967:fig. 162c,e). The relics of the Andean civilization exhibit the same inti- mate overlap of ophidian and sun cults and preoccupation with the mystical value of numbers as elsewhere in the Americas. A most succinct artistic expression of this is a low relief in stone from the Bolivian altiplano (fig. 4) showing the sun god Inti as a circular human face from which radiate four stylized ser- ti'7', 4 _ , Fio. 4.

The signifi- cance of this animal is apparent in an object of gold repouss6, probably of recent manufacture, from Ecuador (fig. 5). It shows the sun god Inti as anthropomorphic, his head being the rayed sun disc. In his right hand he holds a sinuous serpent, and in the left is a scepter one end of which has a llama's head. The fingers or toes on each of the sun god's limbs number only four. The Andean civilization best exemplifies the fusion of the characteristic features of different animals to produce an artistic hybrid (Tello 1923). Figure 6 is of an embossed gold pectoral showing the condor god, symbol of the sun. The bird's head is feline, but its crown consists of two stylized serpents, while the wing and tail feathers are in the form of serpents, each with a feline head seen frontally or in profile. The serpent-feline hy- brids bear the ventral scales of the reptile, and the mystical A FIG. 5.

F.Cdg,m o 19358 i.9) number four is once again maintained in the wing and tail groups. Jaguar, condor, and serpent are the most commonly joined motifs in Andean art, but eagle, hawk, toad, viscacha, bat, monkey, and fish figure occasionally as secondary motifs. Of all these animals, it would seem a priori that the serpent must antedate the others in cultic origin, though it is clear that the jaguar assumed equal importance. I am not competent to evaluate the sequence of adoption of these animals, especially the serpent relative to the jaguar, in Andean cult practices; systematic archaeological analyses-by area specialists may even- tually prove very rewarding in this respect. Yet, two important archaeological examples suggest the fundamental significance of the serpent as the Andean cult animal par excellence. The monolithic granite idol "El Lanz6n," from Chavin de HuAntar, Peru, is one example. Because of both its prominence in its sanctuary and its size, it was evidently the most sacred cult deity of this culture. Its body, though anthropomorphic, is dominated by feline and ophidian features, especially at head and crest levels; from the torso downwards it has a strangely ophidian suggestiveness. It tapers into a rough cylinder as it approaches the ground, in which the lowest part is buried. In at least one previously published diagram of this monolith (fig. 7, left) the rear surface of this lowest section possesses al- most imperceptible engravings of a serpent's ventral scales, much like those seen in the wings and tail of the condor god in figure 6. Other animals, such as birds, are also represented at the temple of Chavin de HuAntar, but these are lesser super- natural beings and are positioned mainly at portals, away from the "Lanz6n" (Tello 1960:172; Rowe 1962:9). The second Andean example is even more indicative, at least for one part of Peru, of the preeminence of the serpent motif |n 4 @'~~~~~ 'I Fio. 7. "El Lanzon," Chavin de Huantar, Peru.

It comes from recent excavations at Ko- tosh, not very far from Chavin de Hufintar. The importance of the Kotosh finds is that they predate the earliest, formative Chavin culture by about 300 years. They also confirm previous data regarding the absence of classic Chavin-style designs in the earlier phases of Kotosh culture. It is significant, moreover, that the representations of fangs which characterize the Chavin feline motif are not recognizable at Kotosh, though at a later period there are other undoubted Chavinoid influences in Kotosh ceramics (Izumi and Sono 1963:153-57, pl. 41, 100c,d, 122; Patterson 1971:40). A number of anthropomorphic idols of clay, but not of stone, were discovered at Kotosh. Their faces have only a broad, depressed band to show the mouth, which is plain and definitely nonfeline. Large quantities of llama bones were discovered, suggesting that the animal had been domesticated in the earliest pre-pottery period, radio- carbon-dated to earlier than 3,800 B.P., but the llama apparent- ly had not yet attained the obvious sanctity and association with the sun god that is discernible in figures 4 and 5. For our theme, it seems to me most significant that among the Kotosh finds from the Sajara-patac period, when neither obviously Chavin-influenced art designs nor feline motifs are recognizable, the serpent does indeed appear. Anthropomorphic designs on ceramics of this period are "very rare, but the one representa- tion of a human figure holding snakes is notable" (Izumi and Sono 1963:157). The Peruvian predilection for combining the attributes of different animals into a chimaerical deity was apparently a late development in religious art. Through all its rich variety, the ophidian motif emerges recurrently and reflects the same strong popularity of chthonic cults as in the northern Andean region and beyond. In the religion of the Bahia phase (400 B.C.- A.D. 280) in Ecuador, serpents and dragon-like elements were central. From the San Agustin culture of Colombia, whose be- ginning may date to the 6th century B.C., comes a monolith (fig. 8) in which ophidian and human features, and seemingly those of a frog, are combined (Bennett 1946:pl. 173; Reichel- Dolmatoff 1965:88). As parallels to such artistic works as these, one could cite numerous superstitions in which serpents command great im- portance among present-day South and Central American In- dians, no matter how important other aniinals may also be to UP':; FIG. 8. Monolith from a mound temple, San Agustin, Colombia (re- printed from Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965:88, fig. 18, by permission of publisher). them. Thus, the principal creature in the creation myth of the coastal Cuna of Panama is the sea tortoise. It is never harmed; its precious shell plates are removed by the Cuna for a liveli- hood and the animal sent back defenseless into the sea. Neither, however, do they harm the rattlesnake. It is ambivalently called the friend of man, though the Cuna generally equate venomous serpents with demons who cause sickness and bite violators of tribal taboos (Nordenski6ld 1938:375, 382, 396). In concluding these examples, I should remark upon the jaguar, an animal whose cultic or totemic importance at times equals the serpent's. Much has been written about the cult of the feline, largely because of the art it generated among the advanced civilizations in Mesoamerica and in the Andean re- gion (Benson 1972). Yet it must be stressed that the jaguar seems to have acquired this importance late and only as part of the continual local differentiation of cult practices among diverse groups descended from the earliest inhabitants of the New World, and that among many tribes other beasts may command similar esteem. The amalgamation of serpent and jaguar characteristics is common in the art of the Olmecs, and it occurs just as power- fully in the roughly contemporaneous culture of Chavin. These cultures seem to have developed similar mythologies and re- ligions, joining zoomorphic traits in the art of their formative periods. The question of the increasing complexity of their art and the spread of "composite" animal deities is therefore re- lated to the origin and possible relationships of these cultures in remote antiquity. There can be little doubt that the cult of the feline was abetted by a tropical habitat which directly or indirectly affected both the ancestral Olmec and the ancestral Chavin people (Lathrap 1971). The impression exercised by the powerful and dangerous jaguar upon the minds of people inhabiting the vicinity of tropical jungles must indeed have been strong, and the awe and superstitions generated by it may be likened to those stem- ming from the venomous serpent or the gigantic anaconda. This view accords well with Reichel-Dolmatoff's (1972) anthro- pological observations on present-day tribes of Colombia, such as the Paez. To the PAez, he says, the jaguar is the symbol of procreative power, a symbol with a strong sexual component representing masculinity, the danger of sexual assault on wom- en, and abduction. It also reflects clan rivalries and dangers of warfare and is interpreted as associated with exogamic mar- riage rules. Thunder is the theme of all Paez myths, and in them the jaguar is the principal character signifying human fertility: In the beginning of time, a young Paez woman is raped by a jaguar, and from this union a thunderchild is born. Embodying the jaguar spirit, this child grows up to be a culture hero. He is in this respect little diffeirent from Quetzalc6atl. The Paez live in the vicinity of San Agustin. There is, at this ancient site, a sculpture which shows a jaguar copulating with a woman. Symbols such as this are surely reflected in the be- liefs of these successors of the San Agustin culture. Yet it is remarkable that the modern Paez also provide a case which seems to signify a transfer of a mythical behavioral trait from jaguar to serpent. Hernandez de Alba (1946:953) mentions that a sacred lagoon was drained, not much earlier than 1946, because a serpent that dwelt in it was believed to seduce girls, keeping them for a whole year and releasing them only when they were about to become mothers. This assignment of the symbolism of human fertility to the serpent is indeed a rare instance in the Americas. That this function, normally the prerogative of the jaguar in Pfaez myth, was relinquished to the serpent only redounds to the prestige of the latter. The lithic sculpture of the west coast of Costa Rica, often executed in the round, stylistically recalls Andean and sub- Andean art. The stone figures of the Diquis region strikingly recall those of San Agustin in Colombia and of Los Barriles in Vol. 17 * No. 3 * September 1976</page><page sequence="10">neighboring Panama (Stone 1964:192-209). The anthropo- morphic cult statues of the Diquis area commonly exhibit ser- pents issuing from the mouth singly or in pairs (fig. 9). Feline teeth occur occasionally in these human-headed statues. In a specimen which is comparable to the art of San Agustin (fig. 10), however, we have a clear combination of feline and ophid- ian aspects and of their anthropomorphic alter ego. The jaguar is subtly suggested in the form of the animal's head, but because of its general shape, its fanged mouth, and especially its rounded-columnar body, it is the personality of the serpent which emerges most forcefully. In the Nicoya region of Costa Rica and in Panama, a croco- dile deity is prominent and is represented zoomorphically or by a crocodilian head over a human body. In either case, the deity's ophidian character is also made evident by a bifid tongue or a tongue in the form of-a serpent. On the other hand, jaguar traits are generally not as prominent in Costa Rica or Panama as in Olmec Mexico. They figure primarily in small personal ornaments such as gold or jade pendants rather than C &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~X FIG. 9.

Stone effigy, iusrgo, Costa Rica (reprinted from KufanDi Soe1964:207, fig. 173, courtermsyio of HauhrvadUnvrst) as cult objects. Clearly, the jaguar's importance is less than the serpent's in these regions of Central America. My final examples of the relative positions of serpent and jaguar as cult animals must come from Mexico. It is in the art of the Olmecs that we see the most emphatic expressions of the feline cult. For the probable anthropological basis of this cult we must fall back once again on Reichel-Dolmatoff's useful comparisons of Paez and Tukano myths from Colombia with those still prevalent along the Mexican Gulf Coast near Vera- cruz. Jaguar spirits called chaneques survive in the folklore of this region as rain spirits who dwell in cascades and are in sev- eral ways closely comparable to the thunderchild jaguar of Nez myths. These Mexican chaneques are imagined as ferocious baby jaguars that sexually molest and persecute women. It is these spirits that seem to have been represented in Olmec sculpture by emphasizing a generally baby-like appearance and a pronounced jaguar mouth (Covarrubias 1957:56; Coe 1962:85). Essentially rain spirits, they are believed to have been the prototypes of the rain deities of later periods in Mexi- can history. Thus, the feline-mouthed Olmec sculptures per- sonify two important elements-terror and rain-which are also associated with the serpent. Did the Olmecs extend to the jaguar traits belonging fundamentally to the serpent? In the larger American context of deeply rooted ophidian beliefs, this is probably the case. Among the later cultures of Mexico, upon whom the Olmecs left their impress, the ser- pent's importance was increasingly reasserted at the expense of the jaguar. Of course, the motif of this animal, joined with that of the serpent, persisted with increasing embellishment (Kubler 1972a), but the important rain and agricultural deities were primarily ophidian. A sculptured head of Tlaloc, for ex- ample, portrays him with serpents around the eyes and mouth (fig. 11). In the larger context of cultic evolution, it seems likely that the Olmecs superimposed their jaguar myths upon a pre- existent serpent cult. Tlaloc's jaguar aspect is most readily ob- servable in post-Olmec southern Mexican art (Rands 1953b: 362) and may have stemmed from the early phases of the Olmecs in this region. A number of archaeological sites show the spread of an un- mistakably Olmec style from the Pacific coastal areas of Chia- pas and Guerrero across the central highlands in Morelos to the Gulf Coast, the classic heartland of the Olmecs. They clearly disclose that during their late formative period, ca. 1000 B.C., a syncretism of ophidian and feline cult practices had already begun. At Izapa and Pijijiapan, near the Guate- mala border and not far from the Pacific coast, there are large boulders of obviously religious interest. Atop these are en- graved bracket-shaped marks (one even has teeth) combined with curved processes, depicting in the most abbreviated but unmistakable terms the combination of jaguar mouth and ophidian bifid tongue (Navarrete 1969:193, fig. 6a-d). The relics of the Olmec Formative period which perhaps best epitomize attitudes towards these two animals occur at Chal- catzingo, in the central highlands of Morelos. They comprise a series of simple but powerful paintings and low-relief engravings FIG. 11. Tlaloc, rain deity of the Aztecs (reprinted from Garcia Payon.1975 :147, fig. 11, by permission of publisher). 438 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS on rock (Gay 1971). There are two separate representations of jaguars at Chalcatzingo, both naturalistic portrayals which re- flect no reverence for the animal. One simply shows a seated jaguar. In the other, terror of the beast is the obvious theme; it shows two jaguars trampling over and mauling helpless, re- cumbent human beings. By contrast, the serpent at Chalcat- zingo is depicted more frequently and with powerful cultic overtones. The low reliefs include simple coiled serpent forms as well as "earth-monster" forms. There is a rain deity shown within a cave whose opening is represented as the stylized open mouth of a serpent, and there is a monstrous stylized serpent with a human being either emerging from its mouth or being swallowed up to waist level. A huge bifid tongue dominates the composition, giving the impression that it sprouts from the man's head (fig. 12). It may be that, like the jaguar panel, this is a "terror" scene, for ophiolatry, after all, is rooted in terror. Considering the almost universal overlap of serpent and solar cults, however, I am inclined to agree with Cook de Leonard (1967) that what is depicted here is the birth of the sun god. Or, extending the idea of the sun's role as the determinant of the weather, might not the emergent human being represent the serpent's alter ego, the rain deity? The painted red picto- graphs at Chalcatzingo include four signs, each about 12 cm long, precise portrayals of the bifid reptilian tongue. Directly alongside these tongues are painted, in parallel, four simple vertical lines. It is easy to concur with Gay's (1971:93) summation of the Chalcatzingo relics: "The serpent, not the jaguar, was central to the prevailing religious system of Meso-america, from Maya to Aztec, and as many of their basic principles were probably derived from the Olmecs, it is highly probable that the serpent, not the jaguar, was also central to the Olmec religion." To this statement I would add that as potential cultic rivals of the ser- pent, other animals everywhere else in the Americas seem to have been no more successful than was the jaguar in Meso- america. NORTHEASTERN ASIAN SURVIVALS The apparent supremacy of the serpent as a cult object among widely disparate groups of American aborigines justifies this inference: Impressions of certain supernatural qualities of this animal must have been firmly embedded in man's deepest psyche even as the earliest groups of immigrants from northern Asia were trekking across Beringia to North America. This very ancient legacy of superstitions eventually produced the widest variations of details ancillary to a common thread of ideas. Embracing the sun, the weather, numerology (especially the number four), agricultural (but not human) fertility, and the accommodation of other animals, these primitive religious ideas are nowhere blended with ideas of Hindu-Buddhist origin. Is the ethnographic and archaeological information from FIG. 12. Rock engraving at Chalcatzingo, Morelos, Mexico (re- printed from Cook de Leonard 1967 :fig. 4, by permission of pub- lisher). northeastern Asia compatible with that from the Americas? The question is a corollary to the circumstances that this part of Asia was geographically contiguous with the Bering-Chukchi plateau which once linked it to North America and that its present populations still carry, as do American indigenes, high frequencies of blood-group 0. The answers lie in a special field and can be given here only briefly. Long before the alleged Chinese influences upon the Chavin culture of Peru, ca. 600-200 B.C., the northernmost Chinese and Manchurian regions witnessed significant human migra- tions. Some of their ancient inhabitants either stemmed from or were, because of the common conditions of existence, cul- turally akin in many ways to the Paleolithic hunting tribes spread over the vast expanse of land from the Urals to eastern Siberia. Initially western Siberian in origin, many tribes gradu- ally migrated eastward from at least Upper Paleolithic times onwards. The kinship of contemporary Tungus and Yukagir Siberian tribes of the Amur River basin with the ancient in- habitants of the Lake Baikal region seems clear on the basis of cranial measurements. Similarly, the cultures of contemporary tribes such as the Nanai, from the lower Amur, have affinities with the Chinese and Manchu (see Okladnikov 1959). In all of these northeastern Asian tribal cultures, the passage of time produced distinct individualities, but some remarkable similarities of art and folk beliefs are detectable. The similarity of the art of the Amur tribes with that of the Neolithic Yang- shao culture of northwestern China, radiocarbon-dated to ca. 4000 B.C. (ChMng 1973), may have had its beginnings in even more remote times. Okladnikov (1959:32,33) points out that both anthropologically and archaeologically the ancestral roots of the eastern Siberian tribes are in varying degrees traceable to the Paleo-Siberian peoples of the Lake Baikal and Middle Yenisei regions of central Siberia. Here, at Paleolithic sites like Mal'ta, finds such as mammoth teeth engraved with ser- pent motifs and other relics reflect the prevalence of an ancient ophidian cult (Abramova 1967). Within this broad framework, the modern Chinese dragon is a regional survival-a mythic, variant form of the serpent. A motif painted on a pot of the Yang-shao culture (fig. 13) is the earliest indication of this known to me (Tresors 1973:acc. no. 30). As a zoomorphic design it is a notable rarity, for it oc- curs on pottery of a class in which painted geometric motifs predominate. Cross-hatched over half its length and painted FIG. 13.

Vol. 17 N No. 3 * September 1976 439</page><page sequence="12">solid over the other half, the animal is clearly intended to rep- resent the Ouroboros, a reptile consuming itself progressively from the tail end-a symbol of the course of the sun, the diurnal cycle, and related cosmic ideas (Deonna 1952). Its paired feet suggest the incipience of the mythic dragon. Now, like the ser- pent in the Americas, the modern Chinese dragon is a creature associated with moisture (clouds or rivers), and the spherical object often seen clutched by the animal symbolizes the sun. Moreover, symbols of thunder and lightning may be engraved within it. The dragon is characteristically associated with the four cardinal points and with the four gods of rain and thunder (Lou 1957, Williams 1960). Might it not, then, be more than coincidence that the feet of the Yang-shao zoomorph are four- clawed and that four scales decorate its neck? And can the latter feature fail to recall the analogous markings on the necks of lightning-serpents in Hopi sand paintings (fig. 3)? The most significant analogies to our American examples come from Siberia itself. Figure 14 represents a gravestone from an Upper Paleolithic settlement in the central Yenisei River basin, where numerous relics of a sun-worshipping people have been found. One need call attention only to the bifid reptilian tongue engraved over the sun deity's forehead, the horizontal straight line across its face (perhaps to symbolize the diurnal cycle, like the Ouroboros of fig. 13), and the four serpents rising towards the sun face. The ophiolatrous traditions of contemporary Siberian tribes are well documented: Yakut tradition holds that their "first" shaman's body was made up of a mass of serpents; the Evenki (Tungus) shaman, who may employ a serpent "helper-spirit," imitates the animal's sinuous movement during his seance; Altaic shamans' robes are decked with ribbons and feathers representing serpents (Eliade 1964). In an Evenki shaman's chant, the line "the snake-my ancestress" occurs twice, fol- lowed by a pause before the shaman turns around "according to the course of the sun" (Vasilevic 1968:354,355). As in the Americas, I have found in Siberian folklore no in- stances in which serpents emblematize human fecundity. On the contrary, overtones of this function are detectable in the cult of the bear, an important and widespread Siberian cult of great age. Phallic ceremonies were part of bear worship and ritual sacrifice; bear cubs were raised like foster children and addressed as "son" or "daughter" in childless families; and many myths, like those of the Yenisei Ostyaks, had to do with bears fathering children or women giving birth to bear cubs (Alekseenko 1968). From a diffusionist viewpoint, perhaps the most revealing survivals of ophiolatry occur among the Nanai. These inhabit- ants of the Amur and Ussuri River basins of easternmost Si- beria employ amulets to heal or ward off disease .(Di6szegi 1968:387). One type (fig. 15) is metallic and depicts pairs of serpents facing each other. Normally, four pairs are roughly cut into each amulet.4 Ancillary figures of the bear or tiger (around which, also, a cult exists) may or may not be cut into the amulet or hang from it. Another type (fig. 16) is anthro- pomorphic and cut from wood. Its body is flat and the head is oval. This is a "tiger" amulet, the stripes being shown by ser- pents etched and painted on the head and body. Similar an- thropomorphic "bear" and "panther" amulets are also made. In each case, it is remarkable that the oval heads are etched, on one or both sides, with a horizontal straight line. This can- not fail to recall the motif of the Upper Paleolithic sun deity from the Yenisei gravestone just described. Whether these Nanai amulets are in fact derived from cults of an age as dim and distant as that represented by the Yenisei gravestone it is difficult for me to ascertain. In any case, contemporary sur- 4 In some cases, simple separating grills may create the illusion that there are more than four pairs. FIG. 14.

SUMMARY The origins of ophiolatry in the Western Hemisphere are ob- scure. It may be part of an extremely ancient, worldwide pat- tern of veneration of cult animals; it may have arisen inde- pendently among the Northeast Asian immigrants to the New World only after they had crossed the Bering-Chukchi land bridge between at least 15,000 and 25,000 to 45,000 years ago; or it may have been affected, if not imported, by serpent- (or dragon-) venerating societies of the Old World in relatively very recent times. Such influences could have come in the early pre- or post-Christian centuries from Indianized Asia or from China if these regions had had contacts with civilized pre- Columbian Meso- and South America as has been postulated by some diffusionists. The latter alternative is here rejected on the basis of examples which show the fundamental unity of certain features of ophidian cults among both civilized aborigi- nal societies and the most backward and isolated indigenes throughout the Americas. Their myths and artistic creations involving the serpent in relation to other cult animals, the sun, human and agricultural fertility, and numerology are too sharp- ly dissimilar to Hindu-Buddhist traditions to have been influ- enced by them. In addition, incongruities in blood-group dis- tribution patterns exclude the possibility of such late influences. On the other hand, these same criteria have been used with examples from archaeology and ethnography to suggest that ophiolatry is one of the very earliest of cultural imports into the Americas and that its strongest links are with northeastern Asia, particularly Siberia. Comments by RALPH BOLTON Department of Anthropology, Pomona College, Claremont, Calif. 91711, U.S.A. 21 in 76 As evidence against a diffusionist interpretation of the existence of similarities in serpent cults and related beliefs in Asia and the New World, Mundkur emphasizes what he regards as certain "fundamental" differences in the content of the serpent lore of the two hemispheres. He repeatedly asserts, for example, that the serpent is not connected symbolically with human fertility in the Americas, whereas almost everywhere in southern Asia such an association is significant. He dismisses contrary cases (e.g., the P'aez) as rare and isolated instances, pointing out that "after a meticulous search of the literature, I am aware of hardly any exceptions involving large or important ethnic groups which seriously threaten the validity of my viewpoint." But surely the contrast is overdrawn. Examining the ethnographic records for the contemporary Qolla and Quechua Indians of the Central Andes, two of the largest ethnic populations in the New World, one encounters frequent references to beliefs and practices suggesting reptilian involvement in human reproduction. For illustrative purposes, I would like to cite a few such items. Snake meat is recom- mended by Kallawaya curanderos as a cure for female sterility and for male impotence; the Kallawaya are famous as curers throughout most of highland South America. A soup made from snake meat is said to facilitate childbirth in difficult cases (Oblitas 1971:36-39). Snake meat may also serve as a contra- ceptive if it is prepared properly; the snake must be killed, ground up, mixed with water, and drunk (Bolton and Bolton 1976). According to Otero (1951:181), both Quechua and Aymara speakers in Bolivia maintain that serpents possess ex- traordinary sexual powers and that they have the capacity to impregnate women. Serpents are thought to be attracted by menstrual fluids, and they may pursue menstruating women, entering them through the vagina while they sleep or when they have become inebriated (Roca 1966:61-64). Likewise, serpents are fond of human milk, and they seek out lactating women from whom they can obtain it, surreptitiously, of course. In- deed, human milk is sometimes used as a remedy for snake bites, applied to the wound on a cloth (Oblitas 1971:479). Mundkur mentions the handsome serpent-princes who "weave their way through Hindu mythology, changing their form at will to seduce ordinary mortals." Tales of this sort are fairly common in the Andean narrative tradition as well. Ex- amples can be found in the collections by Arguedas and Stephan (1957:147-55) and by Miranda (1971:66-68). Undoubtedly, there are differences between the Hindu tales and the Andean tales, but the point is that serpent-seducers occur in both places. As further evidence for his argument, Mundkur cites sharp differences in numerology between Indian Asia and the New World. Again, the differences may not be as great as he believes them to be. Sharon's (1973) recent work on the mesa of a Peru- vian shaman demonstrates the importance of the numbers one, three, seven, twelve, and thirteen, as in Indian Asia, and all of this in association with a serpent staff as one of the "power objects" in the ritual assemblage. To be sure, Sharon's materi- als may reflect European influences rather than aboriginal pat- terns, but the mystical significance of some of these numbers could be of Andean origin (Bolton and Sharon 1976). My intention is not to imply that the above information sup- ports a diffusionist position with respect to trans-Pacific con- tacts; other interpretations are conceivable, including some not considered by Mundkur in his attempt to account for Asian and American similarities in serpent lore (e.g., psycho- logical theories). I do, however, consider the above data as evidence which runs counter to Mundkur's argument against the diffusionsists' theory. It seems to me that one problem con- fronting the antidiffusionist is the opposite of one faced by the diffusionist: the latter depends on too little data, the former must cope with too much. Both are plagued by the problem of selectivity as a result, and the accusation of selectivity hurled by Mundkur against the diffusionists could as easily be directed against his own analysis. by CHARLES E. BORDEN Laboratory of Archaeology, Department of Anthropology and Sociol- ogy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada V6T 1 W5. 26 iII 76 The results of Mundkur's wide-ranging comparative analyses tend to refute hypotheses which propose that ophiolatrous be- liefs and cults were relatively late trans-Pacific imports from Southeast Asia. Instead, Mundkur's research points to northern Eurasia and more specifically ,to Siberia as the more likely source of the cultural stimuli that spawned the many similar concepts and practices among American Indians concerning serpents and ophidian-related monsters. Such traditions extend even to the Eskimo and Aleut, whom Mundkur cites as excep- tions to the universality of these beliefs in the New World be- cause they "are very specialized products of an extremely harsh environment uninhabited by reptiles." As is shown, for in- stance, by the dragon-like palraiyuk and the "man-worm" of the Bering Sea Eskimo, ophidian and related creatures can survive as mythological beings even in arctic habitats (e.g., Nelson 1899:397, 444-45; pl. XCV, 3; figs. 155, 156). This observation also eliminates the difficulty of bringing ophiola- trous traditions through the formidable arctic filter, a problem to which Mundkur alludes in his comments about the Eskimo, but upon which he does not elaborate. Vol. 17 * No. 3 * September 1976 441</page><page sequence="14">The virtually universal supremacy of the serpent as a cult object among aborigines in the Western Hemisphere persuades Mundkur to hypothesize that "impressions of ... this animal must have been firmly embedded in man's deepest psyche even as the earliest groups of immigrants from northern Asia were trekking across Beringia to North America." This hypothesis needs to be qualified, particularly in view of the dates of "be- tween at least 15,000 and 25,000 to 45,000 years ago" which Mundkur cites for such crossings. We may seriously doubt whether man accorded snakes much attention 45,000 years ago. Even many millennia later, as at- tested by the thousands of examples of late Upper Paleolithic graphic and plastic art (ca. 25,000-11,000 B.P.) from through- out northern Eurasia, man was obviously mainly preoccupied with two major themes: (a) the animals of his food quest and (b) woman, perhaps chiefly as a mother figure of both human beings and animals (Abramova 1967, Graziosi 1960). In this vast assemblage of art, representations of snakes are extremely rare; statistically they amount to no more than a small fraction of one per cent. As far as I have been able to ascertain, only a single Siberian site, Mal'ta, in the Upper Angara River drain- age, has produced one artifact, a rectangular plaque of mam- moth ivory, which is decorated on one face with three clearly incised snakes (Abramova 1967:pls. L,2; LI,2). Parallel closely spaced wavy lines covering a few ornaments have also been identified as snakes, but this interpretation is unconvincing. In short, the slender evidence from this one Siberian site hardly justifies Mundkur's contention that it reflects "the prevalence of an ancient ophidian cult" (italics mine). The Mal'ta finds are terminal Pleistocene in age. The radiocarbon date for the earlier of the two cultural horizons of the side is 14,750 + 120 B.P. (GIN-97) or 12,800 B.C. (Klein 1967:226; 1971:141). Thus, on the basis of currently available data, the most we can say is that an incipient interest in serpents is manifest in some north- ern Eurasian art of late Upper Paleolithic age. Consequently, attitudes and early beliefs concerning snakes and related mytho- logical creatures may have been introduced and spread in the New World by late Pleistocene-early Holocene population shifts induced by the submergence of the huge and once popu- lated land-mass of Beringia. These population movements would have been furthered, moreover, by the concomitant vanishing of the continental ice sheets which had covered vast areas of the North American continent during the last glacial maximum (Borden 1969, 1975). The development of formalized ophidian cults in all likeli- hood did not occur until postglacial time. In this connection it is important to emphasize that, according to diffusion studies, protracted intercontinental cultural exchanges continued even after the land connection between the two hemispheres was severed at the end of the Pleistocene (Borden 1962, 1975; Griffin 1960; de Laguna 1947; Leroi-Gourhan 1946; Schuster 1952; Tolstoy 1958). Hence, some of the remarkable parallels in ophidian mythology and cult practices in Asia and the Ameri- cas may well be attributable to such postglacial exchanges. Mundkur (fig. 14) cites as a significant analogy to American examples a "gravestone" from the Yenisei River basin. De- picted on the stone is the erect figure of a sun god, a corona of rays emanating from the deity's head and four serpents rising toward the solar face. On the basis of all that is known about cultural development in northern Eurasia, this highly stylized and formalized composition cannot possibly be of Upper Paleolithic age as Mundkur's article alleges. The artifact might fit into a Neolithic context or perhaps date to an even later period. It is to be hoped that Mundkur's evocative article will focus renewed attention on the problem of intercontinental culture flow across the Bering Strait area. Ophiolatry is probably only one of many cultural complexes that travelled this route, and very likely the flow was not all in one direction. The present quickening of archaeological investigations in Siberia as well as in Alaska and Canada should provide a plethora of new data for the testing of old and new hypotheses. by AKE HULTKRANTZ Institute of Comparative Religion, Stockholms Universitet, Fack, 104 05 Stockholm 50, Sweden. 14 II 76 The theme of this article echoes anthropological problems of times long past, and its somewhat patchy structure also seems outdated. This is unfortunate, for we need to see much more on religion and mythology in CA. An article like this could leave the impression that we are not yet ready for this sort of work. I shall concentrate here on two main issues, the validity of the task and the question of methods. As to the contents, there are some good observations, such as the comparisons with ideas of snakes in Hindu-Buddhist traditions and the interesting sur- vey of relations between jaguar and snake in Mesoamerican art and religion. Otherwise, there is a remarkable lack of informa- tion in this article on the role of the snake in American cultures. The task the author has set for himself is not very rewarding. There is worship of serpents in Asia and in America; whether they are offshoots of the same tradition is impossible to prove, since we have no direct diffusional links between the two conti- nents. Archaeology does not help us. The idea of an introduc- tion of such worship in later times, say, after the birth of Christ, seems unwarranted. An ideology around the serpent might develop wherever religious symbolism is anchored in animals (as it is among hunters). It is the religious sentiment that seeks expression, not the other way round, the natural object that provokes religion. Mundkur, however, is impressed by human beings' general fear of the snake family. He dates serpent wor- ship in America to the beginnings of Amerindian culture be- cause, in its associations with moisture, the sun, and the four cardinal directions, it was rooted in fear of the animal (a new version of deosfecit timor?). It is possibly this simplistic attitude to the origins of religion that lies behind the notion that the serpent "a priori" must antedate a line of other animals (such as the condor, eagle, hawk, and jaguar) "in cultic origin." I do not think we can state anything of the sort. It would have been more beneficial if Mundkur had tried to analyze, comparatively, systematically, and phenomenologi- cally, the ideas in question. For instance, his concept "cult of the serpent" seems to mean various things: a cult of this animal, a cult of a god who may take its form, rites and observances in which snakes appear, myths and folktales about snakes. The author mingles all these aspects, and we may well ask whether he is talking about snakes or religious thoughts and actions. Some concepts are, to say the least, problematic: Mundkur speaks lightheartedly of the "cultic or totemic importance" of the jaguar (and serpent) and of "a particular animal totem or totems" possessed by the first immigrants across Beringia. The author's methods are faulty. No real comparison with Old World ophiolatry can be made unless all known expres- sions of snake worship and ideology have been registered for the New World. The lacunae in this account are disturbing, and important symbols, such as the antagonism between water monsters and thunderbirds in North America, are overlooked. (It seems, on the whole, that the intriguing problem of the meaning of serpent symbolism has been dismissed.) The North American survey is superficial, fragmentary, and am- biguous (see, e.g., what is said about the Iroquois), and the author evidently is not well informed. For instance, the North- west Coast Indians are presented as "one [!] of the oldest [!] aboriginal stocks." Our thoughts go immediately to the many stocks involved, among them the Na-Dene, who are of com- paratively recent origin. These are some examples of the inadequacies of this article. I am sad to say it falls short of the mark. 442 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS by ERIKA KANEKO 248, Kamakura-shi, Tebiro 537, Japan. 1 1 III 76 For reasons of time and space, my comments and reservations are presented in the form of a response to Mundkur's basic misconceptions about Heine-Geldern's research on pre-Colum- bian trans-Pacific contacts. 1. On diffusion, Heine-Geldern (1956:280) wrote: "The only thing that counts is whether in a given concrete case a diffusionist explanation is scientifically reasonable or unreason- able." Does this make him a diffusionist? 2. Heine-Geldern (1956:280) imposed severe methodological restrictions on data he would accept as comparative: "They should belong to a large, well-defined complex, such as art styles and metallurgy, which in America, as well as in Asia, are restricted to definite regions and periods and can be dated by archaeological and historical methods." Further (1956:278), "to demonstrate convincingly the existence of cultural rela- tionships the respective correspondences must be highly spe- cific and must concern complicated inventions or concepts, the repeated independent origin of which can only be imagined with difficulty." These methodological premises explain not only Heine-Geldern's self-imposed limitation to "relatively re- cent pre-Columbian periods and a Mesoamerican focus" (Mundkur), but also why a cultural trait like ophiolatry, "one of the most primeval of animal cults," "widespread" and based on man's "extraordinarily primordial reverential fear of this animal" (Mundkur), does not signally lend itself to cross-cul- tural comparison with conclusive results. 3. Heine-Geldern's trans-Pacific research is in no way limited to "a basis of artistic analogies" and a Mesoamerican focus (Mundkur), but includes complicated metallurgical techniques (lost-wax casting, chemical colouring of gold), decorative de- signs, pottery forms, shouldered stone celts, weaving and highly distinctive dying techniques, gold and precious stone inlay on teeth, musical instruments, games, watercraft, plant geography, cosmological and calendar systems, iconography, etc. Besides, the bibliography and casual references to "meanders and spi- rals" and "diffusionists whose theories depend primarily on artistic criteria" sustain the doubt that Mundkur probably does not know Heine-Geldern's trans-Pacific research suffi- ciently well to justify his wholly rejective evaluation of it (cf. bibliography in Kaneko 1970). 4. Heine-Geldern writes (1958:386, my translation):' Above all it is necessary to free oneself of the notion that the settling of Asians in America was in the nature of the post-Columbian European settlement. There is no doubt that the two events were fundamentally different. In the European case it was a mass immi- gration connected with the establishment of agricultural colonies. ... On the other hand, there are no indications whatsoever of pre- Columbian trans-Pacific mass migrations of civilized Asian peoples [Hochkulturvolker], or that Asian peasants ever felt a need to emigrate to America to till the soil there. All indications are that only small groups belonging to definite occupational levels of Asian popula- tions were involved in trans-Pacific contacts with America and that those who settled for good on the foreign continent were soon absorbed into the indigenous population. This was the explanation advanced for the lack of demonstrable Asiatic influences on the American languages concerned. Whether it is also relevant to the blood-group question, which was not discussed in Heine-Geldern's lifetime, will have to be determined by experts. 5. Mundkur writes of "dubious comparisons" and charges Heine-Geldern with "ignoring the elephant's characteristic feature, unfailingly [italics mine] emphasized in Hindu-Bud- dhist art . . . the animal's fanlike ears." If this is meant to apply to the Amaravati instances illustrating Heine-Geldern's (1951: 300) comparison, "subjectivity in comparison" is indeed the danger Mundkur indicates. 6. Finally, it is disturbing that non-Hindu-Buddhist and non- or pre-Sinicized Southeast Asia is left out of consideration. Adequate description and documentation being unfeasible in this context, selective reference is made to data from Rukai and Paiwan (Austronesian-speaking ethnic minorities of Taiwan), which not only share the conceptual characteristics of Mund- kur's non-Hindu-Buddhist ophiolatrous complex, but may, in view of their culture-historical situation, add a different dimen- sion to the subject. by DAVID H. KELLEY Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta., Canada T2N 1N4. 12 II 76 Mundkur makes much of negative evidence from blood groups as disproving contacts between Asia and Mesoamerica. The idea that a small group of travellers, perhaps 300 at a maximum, would have had much genetic effect on a population which may be reasonably estimated at 20 or 30 million people and that the effect would be necessarily differentiable from the effect of such things as the post-Spanish introduction of Filipinos and other Asians seems to me naive. The assumption that distributional evidence of the wide- spread presence of comparable beliefs about serpents indicates their great antiquity is a common anthropological fallacy. It is no more valid than assuming that the presence of the seven-day week from Ireland to China indicates its vast antiquity (which we know, from historical evidence, it does not). The evidence that the earliest human groups to arrive in the New World possessed animal totems is nonexistent, and even contemporary evidence of close relationship between cult beliefs and totemic beliefs is scanty. Yet this fantasy underlies the rest of the recon- struction. One should not be too critical of detail in such a broad summary, yet I am taken aback to find the thunderbird listed as a "familiar or useful creature"-it suggests a mental framework in which any mythical creature is assimilated to the readily observable, which I regard as a poor way to approach mythology. The view that jaguar cults must be late and serpent cults must be early is a conclusion based on no archaeological evi- dence and no clearly defined system of interpretation. The state- ment that the serpent's importance in Mesoamerica was "re- asserted" after Olmec times is a misleading way of stating that in the earliest extensive material we have, the serpent is not as important as the jaguar. The diametrically opposed conclusions of Mackenzie (n.d.) seem to me to depend on substantially more verifiable detail, despite occasional carelessness with details and naivete. by WILLIAM J. KORNFIELD Cajon 514, Cochabarpba, Bolivia. 12 III 76 This stimulating paper would seem to indicate that the "cult of the serpent" in the Americas was not a result of late diffusion (ca. 600 B.C. to A.D. 700) from Asia or Indian Asia, but rather 1 "Vor allem ist es notig, sich von der Vorstellung freizumachen, dass die Niederlassung von Asiaten in Amerika den gleichen Cha- rakter gehabt haben muisse wie die der Europaer in nachkolum- bischer Zeit. Es kann keinem Zweifel unterliegen, dass die beiden Vorgange grundverschieden waren. Bei den Europaern handelt es sich um Masseneinwanderungen, die mit der Anlage von Acker- baukolonien verbunden waren.... Andererseits spricht nicht das Geringste dafiur, dass in vorkolumbischer Zeit je eine Massenein- wanderung asiatischer Hochkulturv6lker iuber den Pazifik nach Amerika stattgefunden hat oder dass asiatische Bauern das Be- diurfnis gefiuhlt hatten, nach Amerika auszuwandern, um dort Feldbau zu betreiben. Vielmehr deutet alles darauf hin, dass es sich bei den transpazifischen Beziehungen von Asiaten mit Amerika um kleine Gruppen bestimmter Bevolkerungsschichten gehandelt hat und dass jene, die sich dauernd in dem fremden Kontinent niederliessen, bald in der einheimischen Bevolkerung aufgingen." Vol. 17 N No. 3 * September 1976</page><page sequence="16">had its origins much earlier, via Siberia. Besides using archaeo- logical data to substantiate this viewpoint, Mundkur refers to recent past and present ethnographic studies which would indi- cate that the serpent, generally associated with rain-making crop-fertility ceremonies in the Americas, has a quite distinct connotation in Indian Asia, related to human fecundity. One of his more conclusive arguments stems from genetics, which appears to demonstrate that the unique deficiency of blood- group B (which is dominant over 0) in the Americas, together with the very high incidence of 0 among the more isolated indigenous peoples of the Americas, cannot be tallied with present-day blood groups in Asia or India and thus points to an origin much further back in time than a relatively late dif- fusion could possibly account for. His use of ethnographic data for a widespread cult of the serpent related to rain making also seems quite compelling, even though his information seems mostly limited to North America. Concerning his analysis of Andean civilizations, while he correctly concludes that the jaguar, condor, and serpent "are the most commonly joined motifs in Andean art," I must take exception to his statement "Of all these animals, it would seem a priori that the serpent must antedate the others in cultic origin, though it is clear that the jaguar assumed equal impor- tance." In ten years of study in Andean archaeology, including fieldwork, I have been much more impressed by the dominance of the feline motif in Chavin art styles. His inference from the still earlier Kotosh artefacts, while suggestive, is by no means conclusive-that the presence of serpent motifs with a corre- sponding lack of feline designs at this one particular site would indicate that the former preceded the feline in Andean art styles is a generalization of doubtful validity. As Willey (1951) has indicated, "The central representation of Chavin art is the feline being." Tello, Bennett, Bird, Corbett, Larco, Busnell, and Kidder II also concur with the view that the feline motif is the dominating characteristic of the Chavin period: "In no other Peruvian art style is a single design con- cept so dominant" (Bennett 1943). Kauffmann Doig (1963), a Chavin specialist from Peru, indicates that the feline is "the preferred motif of Chavin art." For Tello, "the Chavin problem was the history of the feline deity in the development of Peru- vian cultures," and his greatest work, Wira Kocha, is an unusual essay on the occurrences and recurrences of the feline deity in all regions and periods of Peru (Willey and Corbett 1951). While impressed with the great amount of data collected and Mundkur's creditable attempt at a unified holistic approach to ethnographic-archaeological research, I have sensed at times a stretching of rather isolated data to prove his thesis of Asian origins for a supposed serpent cult in the Americas from archae- ology (for example, his citing of terracotta figurines from the Chaco-Santiaguefia culture of Argentina, a low relief in stone from the Bolivian altiplano [fig. 4], and an object of gold re- pousse from Ecuador [fig. 5]). I prefer Rowe and Menzel's (1967) approach to a better understanding of art styles: Let us attempt a decipherment which . . . will enable us to see Chavin art as its makers intended it to be seen. There are two in- dispensable conditions for this kind of decipherment. The first is to pay close attention to context, asking always where and in what combinations design elements or complete designs are used. The second condition is to be able to sort the monuments according to date. It is not necessary to know their dates in years, but we do need to be able to tell, in any comparison, whether two pieces are contemporary or not, and if not, which is the earlier. The seeming lack of archaeological context, together with an absence of meaningful comparative chronology for much of Mundkur's data, would seem to make it difficult to prove that a "serpent cult" indeed existed throughout the Americas. I find his use of ethnographic materials and comparative blood groups both interesting and convincing. I would like to feel the same about the way he analyzes the archaeological data in support of a serpent cult in the Americas and its Asian background. by GEORGE A. KUBLER Department of the History of Art, Yale University, Box 2009, 56 High St., New Haven, Conn. 06520, U.S.A. 2 III 76 Mundkur's combination of the iconological analysis of cultural symbols with the genetic history of human blood-types yields a productive approach to the otherwise unrewarding topic of trans-Pacific diffusionism in Americanist studies. Drawing on his biological training and on his studies of Indic myth and pre-Columbian archaeology, Mundkur presents an argument the ramifications of which are important for Americanists. He states that American ophiolatry differed fundamentally from that of the Old World. He therefore rejects the naive diffusionism of some Americanists, noting (1) that the serpent's associations were with human fertility in India, but with weather in Ameri- ca; (2) that the highly probable absence of A, B, and AB blood groups in ancient Amerindian populations opposes the diffu- sionist argument and supports early genetic isolation in the Americas; and (3) that Amerindian civilizations were only two (Mesomerican and Andean) rather than many reflections of different waves of diffusion. Points 1 and 2 carry weight, but 3 is both more controversial and less substantial, given the fluidity of our notions about "co-traditions" and their demarca- tion. I would also question the equal weighting given to recent ethnological and ancient archaeological instances of serpent motifs and rituals (Kubler 1972b, 1975), as well as the equal weighting of small groups and major civilizations. This question seems unavoidable with the long durations and hemispheric extent of Mundkur's examples. A final section on northern Asian survivals traces the history of the dragon in China, suggesting that its meaning and antiquity parallel those of ancient America without contact. Sinologists familiar with both forms of ophiolatry will better be able to judge the relevance of these examples. by HAROLD FRANKLIN MCGEE, JR. Department of Anthropology, Saint Mary's University, Halifax, N.S., Canada B3H3C3. 27 II 76 Mundkur's article is characterized by unwarranted assumption presented as fact and the use of sloppy methods to test only one of many possible explanations for the presence of serpent cults in the New World. Mundkur tells us he has made a "meticulous search of the literature" and is aware of "hardly any exceptions involving large or important ethnic groups which seriously threaten the validity" of his viewpoint. Is being a threat to the validity of his viewpoint one of the criteria for smallness or un- importance? More important, he seems not to understand that it is the exceptions to hypotheses that allow one to refine theory (see Nadel 1952). I want to know more about the cases Mund- kur threw out. Not even the cases he allows us support his assumption that the serpent is associated with weather, soil fertility, the sun, and the cardinal directions, to the exclusion of human fertility (what about curing and sexuality?). The equation of the serpent and the jaguar, which are concerned with human fertility, weakens his case, as does the Nootkan instance of snakes' en- tering human body orifices, migrating to the stomach, and causing it to swell and rupture-one can "of course" view this as unnatural coition, conception, and abortive birth. Many of Mundkur's other examples can be reinterpreted to suggest that snakes are neither as sexually innocent nor as impotent as he would have us believe. Before one can begin to determine ori- gins of belief systems, it is necessary to understand what those belief systems are. Mundkur must first understand the rela- tionship between form, content, and action in the world views of New World peoples before he tells us from whence they derive. The section on "blood groups and the migration of cults" could have been dealt with in a footnote. The author does not demonstrate why "fear adoration. and superstition" are more CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS discernible in the archaeological record than "marriage, kin- ship customs, and other such fragile social criteria." Isolation may foster conservatism, but I should like some proof that it gives rise to belief in totemic animals. I am not convinced that fear of poisonous snakes is "of course" the proper etiology for the special ideational attention given to serpents-I imagine that Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, or even a second-year undergraduate might suggest an alternative. I shall stop here, but one could go on for pages indicating where Mundkur sub- stitutes assertion for fact, ignorance for familiarity, and convic- tion for hard work. by YOSHIO ONUKI The Little World Foundation Museum of Man, 1-223 Sasashima- cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan. 17 in 76 Mundkur's article touches a very important point: the problem of the unity underlying the diversity of the aboriginal cultures of the Americas. We often find in the Americas similarities of cultural ele- ments among distantly separated regions and even times. Whether these similarities represent independent emergence or diffusion has been much debated. One example involves the common characteristics of the decorations on the oldest pottery discovered in Ecuador, Colombia, and the Southeast of North America. Another example is the possible relationship between Olmeca and Chavin. Still others are the similarities between Mississippian and Mesoamerican Preclassic pottery and simi- larities in sacred numbers (as Mundkur reports), skull deforma- tion, the use of hallucinogenic plants, and the myth motif of the copulation of a woman with a jaguar or bear. It seems to me that the reason for these common features or similarities can be sought in the unity of the basal stratum of the American aboriginal cultures rather than in diffusion or independent invention, and therefore I welcome Mundkur's statement that the importance of the serpent in myths and rites, along with several attributes of the serpent cult, is pan- American. Levi-Strauss and Reichel-Dolmatoff are also seeking this kind of unity, in a sense, and this direction of research de- serves more attention. This unity is possibly composed of a number of elements, both on the level of material culture and on the level of thought, the latter being most important and elementary. It may not be the "impressions . .. firmly embedded in man's deepest psyche," but a more concrete and more clearly manifested thought, even among the first Americans. Finally, I would like to present two archaeological facts which I hope will be somewhat useful to Mundkur. First, in the 3d millennium B.C. in Japan, serpents in relief and modeling appear on Middle Jomon pottery. Second, in the Andes, a double-headed serpent is reported on a cotton textile from Hua- ca Prieta of the 3d millennium B.C., and there is a painted ser- pent on a stone wall of the preceramic Mito period (probably 2000-1500 B.C.) at Kotosh (see Izumi and Terada 1972:140, fig. 82). The point made by Mundkur about llama domestica- tion around 3,800 B.P. at Kotosh must be corrected. According to the research done by Elizabeth Wing, included in the Kotosh report cited above, llama bones increased from the Chavin pe- riod; in the pre-Chavin periods, deer bones predominate over those of the llama. by MARY SCHUBERT 8069 Oberlauterbach, Haus Nr. 55, Federal Republic of Germany. 23 III 76 Mundkur's comprehensive discussion of the Asian background of the cult of the serpent in the Americas has successfully united specialized fields in the study of humanity. His use of human- genetic research discoveries to substantiate his thesis is especial- ly noteworthy. The section dealing with the connection between the serpent and the sun tends, however, to be a little unclear. It is stated that in the Americas the serpent is associated with the sun, whereas in Indian Asia the animal connected with the sun is the horse, not the serpent. On closer examination, however, a relation between the sun and the serpent can be detected: "Vrtra or Ahi (literally 'serpent') is the demon who causes drought," but drought can in reality be caused by the sun; thus serpent is here synonymous with sun. The symbolizing of the solar or time cycle with a circle formed by a serpent biting its own tail could be taken as another example of this relationship. An important aspect of the serpent cult not included in this article is the underlying connection between "rebirth" and the serpent, which may have some relevance to the question why human fertility rather than fertility of the soil is emphasised in a region having a strong religious belief in "reincarnation." These remarks are just comments on details which do not in general affect the main thesis and the conclusions. by JOHN Tu ER-WEI Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. 27 II 76 Mundkur's article is partly acceptable and partly not. I do not differ with him in his view that the serpent myths of the Ameri- cas have been influenced by those of Siberia and China, but I disagree with him when he says that the myths of the Ameri- can Indians involving the serpent and numerology are too dis- similar to Hindu traditions to have been influenced by them. I see great similarity between the Mexicans and the Hindus with regard to the number four and the four cardinal directions. The Mexicans had four powerful godheads for the four cardinal directions: Xiuhtecutli, the fire god; Tezcatlipoca, the war god; Tlaloc, the rain god, and Quetzalcoatl, the wind god; each of the four is connected both with the serpent and with the moon (Codex Magliabecchiano XIII, 3 fol. 89). Further parallels are found among North American Indians in general. This myth conception may have come from India, where there were origi- nally four (later eight) world-wardens who supported the cardi- nal points: Indra, the storm god; Agni, the fire god; Varuna, the rain and water god; and Mitra (or Yama), the underworld god. These four gods also had much to do with moon myths. Thus, in India we have water, fire, storm, and underworld gods, in Mexico water, fire, rain, and wind gods. Are these similar or not? Other similarities between the Americas and India are the following: It is well known that there are accounts of contests between Quetzalcoatl (the bright moon god), the feathered serpent, and Tezcatlipoca (the dark moon god), the god of the night wind. These may be compared to the contests of Indra and Asura. Besides, a Creek myth says that the serpent is in opposition to the rabbit; the rabbit gives the serpent a respite of four days to prepare for the contest and then vanquishes the serpent. The Toda of India have a similar myth of serpent and hare (Kunike 1926:75). The mythology of the thunderbirds' constant warfare with the horned water snakes is well known in the Plains and Woodlands. In India, Garuda (the mythical bird) is the implacable enemy of the serpent. There is a bird- serpent symbol in Maya art (Alexander 1920:134). Still clearer is the following similarity: According to a Winne- bago myth, the creator made four mammals and four serpents the bearers of the world; since they did not support it well, a big bear was appointed to take their place (Kunike 1925:31). On the other hand, the Batak of South Asia say that the earth rests on the horns of a serpent (Naga). Sesha, the world serpent of Hindu mythology, bears the world on his thousand heads. Both in India and the Americas, there are myths identifying serpents or tortoises as bearers of the world (Tu Er-wei 1966: 97-99, 101-3). Vol. 17 N No. 3 September 1976</page><page sequence="18">Thus the influence of India on the Americas in the case of serpent myths appears to be undeniable. Mesoamerica is no exception. That the serpent mythology is originally a lunar one is an opinion held by a number of authorities (e.g., Seler, Ku- nike, Briffault, Schmidt). This is not the place to go into the details. Reply by BALAJI MUNDKUR Biological Sciences Group, University of Connecticut, Box U-N42, Storrs, Conn. 06268, U.S.A. 29 iv 76 The contrasting comments elicited by my views are such as one might expect in the wake of a theme centered around the general subject of cultural diffusion. I have, of necessity, painted an extremely broad canvas, with the serpent as the "synthesizing element" and trans-Pacific migrations as its background. Theories of these migrations have in the past generated sharply divided reactions even when other criteria were used and the canvas was much narrower. The literature reviewed by Gardini (1974) and Riley et al. (1971) illustrates this amply. Specific points of detail raised by some of the commentators seem more amenable to debate in these columns than another, quite crucial issue-the question of blood-group distributions and their far-reaching implications. Since much else is depen- dent upon, and can be clarified with reference to, this issue, I urge my readers to devote special attention to that section while evaluating the rest. Some of the commentators seem to have neglected or misunderstood, if not ignored, its message. I shall therefore open my arguments with a few remarks pertaining to that section and then tackle more specific points of detail raised by my colleagues. In doing so, it is impractical to discuss each one's comments separately and in toto. Hence, it will be necessary to shift from commentator to commentator as occasioned by the sequence of my arguments. The incon- venience this may cause some of my readers will, I hope, be offset by an overall gain in perspective. I The question of ABO blood-group frequencies has generated disproportionately little serious debate in comparison to its significance. Hematological comparisons, being a biochemical tool, afford great analytical precision and have fewer limita- tions than are inherent in osteological comparisons. Kornfield, Kubler, and Schubert, who support and compliment me for my examination of this criterion, find it persuasive and recog- nize its value to the general problem of culture diffusion, but they have not elaborated upon my observations. As the fre- quency distribution figures are unassailable and the biological basis invoked in my discussion is empirical, I wish they had offered more comments upon my arguments and the reper- cussions of the data for Americanists. There are, on the other hand, two detractors-Kelley and McGee. Kelley cannot envision the possibility that "a small group of travellers, perhaps 300 at a maximum, would have had much genetic effect" on a much larger indigenous Ameri- can population. I assume he has Mexico and Guatemala in mind. His estimate of a population of 20 to 30 million seems inflated. The population of the whole of Mexico in 1960 was less than 40 million. Ca. A.D. 700, the imagined period of Asian contacts according to Ekholm (1953), it must have been far less, and even smaller numbers dwelt near religious centers in "Complex A," where the immigrant Asians are believed to have exerted their influence. Let us, for the sake of argument, assume that Kelley's figure of 300 immigrants, though con- jectural, is a fair one. The point is not whether this small South Asian population could possibly have left a marked genetic effect all over the Spanish colonial domains (obviously, it has not). The least we can expect, as I took considerable pains to explain, is that simple Mendelian dominance would ensure rapid diffusion of the imported group-B (or -A) genes around the religious or ceremonial centers of civilized Mesoamerica, or wher- ever this or similar other small populations presumably settled or diffused their art styles and technology. The idea of genetic dominance is a very simple one, and its practical effects are startling alterations of ratios of inherited characteristics like blood groups. Putative South Asian group-B and -A genes, if they were imported ca. A.D. 700 or earlier and fortified by Spanish and Filipino (?) genes since the 16th century, have had more than sufficient time to express themselves phenotypical- ly-at least 1,300 years, on the basis of Ekholm's (1953) hypothesis. Yet, scientific surveys (Matson 1970: tables 1 and 2, map 1) from Mexico to Panama, tribe by tribe, show the remarkable extent to which the 0 group has remained un- contaminated by B or A. Among Chol, Zoque, Lacandon, Tzeltal, and Tzotzil-all residents of "Complex A"-the frequency of B phenotypes, largely an Asian trait, is zero, while that of group 0 is very nearly to fully 100%. The picture is no different among populations more distantly located in Mexico and Guatemala, and right dowrn to Panama. Calcula- tions of gene frequencies show that such hybridization as has occurred (near urban centers, principally) is attributable to relatively recent, Spanish colonial times. One might speculate that Kelley's 300 immigrants from South Asia (or Oceania) did not at all contribute their domi- nant A and B genes to American society. That this small immigrant population-allegedly so influential that it affected the artistic, calendrical, technical, and folkloric achievements of a pre-Columbian civilization already rich in these aspects- did not interbreed with American indigenes is a prospect quite incompatible with the contributions diffusionists have claimed on their behalf. Indeed, Heine-Geldern (see comment by Kaneko) postulated that such small groups "were soon ab- sorbed into the indigenous populations." Kelley might have indicated why he doubts the genetic argument and its relevance to socioanthropology. If he had invested more time in technical verifications, he would have realized that the argument is significant, not naive. I will take this opportunity to strengthen the evidence that the absence or vanishingly low frequencies of A and B genes among American indigenes cannot be attributed to selective elimination of their carriers by venereal syphilis, unjustly branded a New World disease. I will be brief, as the details and less important alternatives should be given elsewhere. The antiquity of treponematoses in the Old World is indicated by a human skull from Tasmania, at least 10,000 years old, that shows the ravages of infection, possibly treponarid (the pre- ferred term for endemic syphilis) evolved from yaws. Pure- blooded Tasmanians and their ancestral Australian aborigines have high frequencies of group 0, ranging up to 78.57% (Mourant et al. 1958:210). Though one cannot be sure what blood group this and similar other skulls represent, they at least place treponematoses in their time perspective (Hackett 1975:238-40). Moreover, a treponeme resembling that of yaws has been isolated in wild baboons (Sepetjian et al. 1969, Fribourg-Blanc 1972). The infection occurs over a wide area of West Africa. Treponemal parasites, like all microorganisms, can mutate to produce a more virulent form of the same disease or a related new disease showing different symptoms, such as yaws, pinta, and the two main types of syphilis. Coinci- dent with the baboon infection, yaws occurs in man in the northern parts of West Africa, while treponarid occurs in man in the south. This strongly suggests that the baboon infection arose at the latest before treponarid mutated from yaws, or 446 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS perhaps even before the origin of the treponema of yaws itself. (I am grateful to C. J. Hackett, now retired from the World Health Organization, Geneva, for this information, received privately.) The mutational step from human endemic syphilis to venereal syphilis must have occurred relatively swiftly in the Old World; exactly where is unknown. G. M. Antal of the WHO Division of Communicable Diseases has confirmed for me an important point about a related matter: that there seems to be no correlation between the various blood groups and the susceptibility to venereal syphilis. Finally, there is positive support for the view that, far from being eliminated by syphilis, the B gene, if it had been intro- duced from South Asia, would actually have thrived in the Americas before the arrival of the Spaniards. Over 25 years ago, Boyd (1950:335) cited research to suggest the idea, then tentative but now no longer so, that "if selection does act on blood group characteristics, there is some reason to think that B is somewhat favored over 0 and A, since the present distribu- tions [suggest] that the B characteristic [a relatively recent mutant] has increased markedly in Asia and Europe ... even within historical times." Boyd also argued (pp. 337-42) against the belief that a blood-group gene that was not very common to begin with (as B would have been if it had been introduced by a very small population of South Asians as diffusionists would have us believe) was in danger of being submerged or lost by random genetic drift, without any action of natural selection whatever. Cultural anthropologists have much to gain by taking data of this kind seriously. Yet, McGee is supercilious. He would consign my entire section "Blood Groups and the Migration of Cults" to no more than a footnote! It is not clear why he dis- dains this section while demanding verbiage on other, ancillary and less crucial points. He calls for psychological interpreta- tions, involving issues not only peripheral to my thesis but also demanding of space. Does he think the genetic data are un- important, or irrelevant to my theme? Can he show that I have not added to the arguments of Stewart (1973)? Have the data no bearing on cultural anthropology in general? Perhaps Mc- Gee is diffident about attempting a direct criticism of their implications. One wonders whether he has read the section carefully and, more important, understood its message. Let me recapitulate explicitly the ramifications of our knowledge of blood-group distribution: It is consistent with the current consensus in physical anthropology that human settlement of the Western Hemisphere occurred via Beringia alone, many thousands of years ago. It seems to have been unidirectional, for geophysical reasons discussed by Stewart (1973). There is little evidence of American contacts with South Asia or Oceania, and what evidence there is is quite recent; some sporadic and very small-scale contacts probably took place between South America and Easter Island (Bellwood 1975:16). The genetic repercussions of such contacts are not detectable in the Americas, however, though research shows that Polynesian blood is derived from a gene pool contributed by South America, Indonesia, and Western Polynesia (Sim- mons 1965). Studies in analogies in art motifs, religious systems, calendars, technologies, etc., between the Americas and Asian countries are of absorbing interest insofar as they disclose aesthetic preferences and thought progression within the human family. As indicators of cultural influences, however, they seem to me to be futile exercises. They have no support from the ABO blood-group data. The first significant alteration in both cultural and genetic balance occurred in the Americas in the early 16th century, following the Spanish conquests. The sole fount of preconquest culture was northern Asia, diffusion of populations taking place gradually southward and eastward in the Americas. Primitive popular beliefs and cults involving animals are intimately a part of these intercontinental and American migrations. II Borden's comments on the archaeological problems concerning human migrations and the origins of cults in time are pertinent and very thoughtful. I, too, have found these questions vexing. I agree with him about the paucity or absence of extremely old archaeological relics with ophidian motifs. Borden empha- sizes that there is only one very ancient relic with a naturalistic portrayal of serpents-the plaque from Mal'ta, Siberia, about 14,000 years old, illustrated by Abramova (1967). He is correct, but I believe he is too conservative in disregarding the value of other, highly suggestive symbols such as meanders and zigzags and the very important batons, also from Mal'ta, originally described by Gerasimov (1935:83) and illustrated by Abramova (pl. 53, figs. 7 and 8). These batons even have heads, tapering bodies, and incisions seemingly in imitation of the ventral and dorsal scales of a serpent. Indeed, Gerasimov himself surmised that they represented serpents. Borden's conservatism does scant justice to man's tendency towards artistic stylization. Meanders and zigzags are common, con- ventional ways of representing serpents. I have elsewhere drawn attention to the very considerable body of literature on such symbolism connected with archaeological objects from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods (Mundkur 1976a). The significance of the Mal'ta mammoth's tooth plaque lies not only in the representation of three undoubted serpents, with swollen heads and sinuous bodies, engraved on it, but also in the pattern etched on its other face. Borden does not mention this, and its probable cultic significance may have escaped his attention. This face of the plaque is etched with swirling, spiral, dot patterns, usually interpreted, and I think correctly, as solar or lunar symbols (Hentze 1932). The rarity of such finds, the cosmic and serpent symbolism, and the absence of similar plaques depicting any other animal, com- bined with the swirl pattern, make the Mal'ta specimen a very important, if solitary, archaeological treasure. In addition, it has a central hole, probably for passing a cord for suspension. Taken together, these circumstances suggest that the object was an amulet, not merely utilitarian and decorative, but cultic. It is significant, moreover, that the motifs on the Mal'ta plaque are of serpents, not of bears, bovids, horses, or other animals. Other undoubted serpent symbols occur in Siberia and sub-Arctic and Arctic Europe, possibly belonging to several elements within cultures shaped by similarities of environment, but their discussion is not appropriate here. In addition, there are the relics described by Lipskii (1970), one of which appears as my figure 14. Borden disputes its identifica- tion as a late Paleolithic gravestone and considers it to be Neolithic; I am unable to judge this myself. The information was given me by a competent interpreter of Russian, and I have since confirmed her accuracy. Borden's dispute is with Lipskii, not with me, since I have no opinion regarding its dating. Lipskii states (p. 163) that evidences of the cult date back to the Upper Paleolithic at the site where the object was found and that by the Late Eneolithic these seem to have vanished. All things considered, the Paleolithic archaeological finds, albeit meagre, taken together with more recent ophidian traditions in Siberian shamanism, suggest that ophiolatry has had a long history in northern Asia, antedating the Paleolithic finds. Because of the limitations of archaeological discovery, it may be impossible to establish rigorously the "true" period when primitive practices centered around an animal matured into a "cult.'' One would be too sanguine to expect to find archaeological evidences dating hack some 45,000 years. Still, I hope my readers will not deny me the latitude of asserting my belief that the cult of the serpent is one of great antiquity. Vol. 17 N No. 3 * September 1976</page><page sequence="20">It could not possibly have sprung up with explosive suddenness relatively late in man's social history. There is very substantial and impressive archaeological material from the Near East, Egypt, Cyprus, Crete, southern Europe, China, and Japan (see, for example, Onuki's comment) dating to Neolithic times, 3000 B.C. and earlier, which is indicative of the impor- tance given to serpents. They are not mere decorative motifs. They betray cultic sentiments. It is impossible to document this effectively in an article such as this, since numerous illustrations and extensive and detailed descriptions of archaeological objects are necessary. Evidence from Paleolithic times is less abundant on a worldwide scale, but surely it is not unreason- able to entertain the view that serpents were venerated long before man fashioned material evidences of them for posterity. This belief is perfectly consistent with the notion-kept alive by structural anthropologists-that primitive man has always lived in close harmony with nature and developed a special relationship towards a particular animal or animals. I believe I have shown that this is true of the serpent, as clearly as space in a journal article allows. III We may now consider certain cross-cultural aspects of the relationships of man and beasts. Several commentators have touched upon them. Kaneko takes the extreme view that "ophiolatry . . . does not signally lend itself to cross-cultural comparison with conclusive results." I am not aware how far her own analyses have progressed to instill such confidence in her, or just what her criteria for conclusiveness are. Let me once again illustrate my thesis that the serpent is more firmly fixed in human sentiments than any other animal in aboriginal America by comparing it with another species pertinent to the Beringia connection: the bear. The Siberian cult of this animal can be traced back to ancient times (Alekseenko 1968). It is still a cult animal among several tribes, for example, the Yenisei Ostyaks; a bear cult exists among the Ainu of Japan (Munro 1963). The bear's habitat ranges (or ranged, before its populations were hunted thin) over very wide regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Many North Asian customs surrounding the bear have close analogies among several North American Indian tribes, notably the Northwest Coast people, the Ojibwa, and others. There are 85 subspecies of Ursus americanus, and they ranged abundantly in historic times from Alaska to Central Mexico. The "spectacled" bear Tremarctos ornatus, now rare, lives in the Andes from southern Venezuela to northern Chile. Now, it is remarkable that while the serpent was woven, along with other animals, into the thinking of innumerable tribes in North America (Klauber 1972: chap. 16), Mesoamerica, and the Andean region, the importance of the bear is scarcely noticeable as one proceeds southward in the Western Hemisphere. To cite one archaeological example: Frequencies of various motifs found in Nevadan and eastern California petroglyphs dating from ca. 5000 B.C. to A.D. 1500 are recorded in detail by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962:86-87). Predominating over all other animal forms are mountain sheep, numbering 259, and serpents, numbering 244. The latter figure is a conservative count, since simple sinuosities, curvilinear meanders, zigzags, and wavy lines which may represent serpents are not included. Only those motifs are included which have "headlike thickenings at one end ... some [of them] unquestionably meant to represent snakes, a few even [having] the rattles of a rattlesnake." Foot or paw marks number 92, but Heizer and Baumhoff specifically discount the possibility that the paws represent bears. Since representations of all quadrupeds (except mountain sheep) put together number only 78, the frequency of serpent motifs seems all the more impressive. Farther south, there appears to be no comparable archaeological example, but the Huichol of northwestern Mexico provide one of the rare examples of a bear deity. They have an earth goddess, Takotsi Nakawe, who is closely identified with crops, such as maize, beans, and pumpkins, and also with the bear. The latter distinction, however, is diluted because the goddess is also simultaneously associated with the armadillo and peccary (Seler 1960, vol. 3:379). In Mesoamerica, there are deities conceived in the forms of the bat, the coyote, the crocodile, the jaguar, etc., but there is no deity, as far as I have been able to determine- certainly no major one-which has ursine attributes. By contrast, ophidian attributes characterize the major deities Coatlicue, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl, and Chicomecoatl. Still farther south, in the Andes, an important deity, "El Lanzon" (fig. 7, right), has obvious ophidian aspects combined with feline. The bear is scarcely depicted anywhere in Andean chimaerical animal representations (Kauffmann Doig 1972). Another important Andean deity, Ai Apec, has a double- headed serpent attribute (Kutscher 1954: pl. 77). Serpents (and felines) are prominent motifs in both Mesoamerican and Andean sculpture, pottery, and textiles; bears are conspicuously absent or rare: Seler (1960, vol. 5:70) mentions a curious bear's paw form only in connection with a tomb in Colombia. To these Mesoamerican and Andean examples one may add ophidian myths, a vast assemblage which seems to overshadow bear mythology. One should recall the modern Siberian ophidian survivals mentioned in my article. Okladnikov (1962:55, 58-60) mentions that serpents, deer, and waterfowl are the most prominent among the motifs on petroglyphs of the Amur and Ussuri valleys, dateable to the 2d to 1st millen- nium B.C. They are chiefly local creations, unrelated to the Central Siberian. Okladnikov's figure 4b does seem to be a representation of a bear's face, though he does not specifically mention either the bear or feline motifs in these petroglyphs. Bear and tiger cults still prevail among the Nanai of these river valleys (Dioszegi 1968), and Okladnikov stresses the relationships of their art forms to these ancient petroglyphs. On the other hand, Arctic fauna includes neither serpents nor tigers. Yet Eskimo art retains traces of serpent motifs (I thank Borden for drawing my attention to this). From all this, one conclusion seems inescapable: the importance of the serpent is a persistent phenomenon, while that of the bear was lost in Mexico and the Andes, a remarkable fact considering that this loss occurred despite the bear's having been a member of the aunas of these regions. Extrapolations can be made in terms of a feline cult; I need not elaborate upon this beyond the statements I have already made regarding the jaguar. Suffice it to say that such a feline cult is hard to detect between Alaska and Central America. Kornfield and Hultkrantz question my view that the serpent probably antedates certain other animals as a cult object. The former correctly understands that I was referring specifically to the Andean civilization; his observations are reasoned and to the point. Hultkrantz is not specific; he gives the impression that my statements refer to the Americas as a whole. Since his objection seems to spring from personal bias on this topic and is unsupported by references to scholarly literature, I will confine my answer to Kornfield's observations. Much of what I have already said about migrations and the transience of particular animal cults in different geographic zones should be recalled here. I agree with Kornfield, with reservations, that the feline motif may be a "dominant" one, though this is truer of more recent periods of art than of the earlier. I think it is more correct to call it "prominent," however, even in the later periods, because kenning, or composite inclusion of other animal motifs with the jaguar's, reduces the "dominance" of the latter to the level of equality. However, art alone does not often betray cultic origins; mythology, especially religious mythology, can give some support. Andean cult origins have a continuous (if hidden) evolutionary history not unrelated to Mesoamerica or even areas farther north. The Kotosh finds are among the few overt indicators of this history. They are 448 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="21">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS significant if only because in the earlier Kotosh periods feline motifs are unknown, whereas the only animal shown alongside a human figure is the serpent (see also Onuki's comment). Future excavations at pre-Chavin sites may tell us more. In "El Lanzon," from the Chavin period site at Chavin de Hu'antar, we have a remarkable cult idol whose general bodily form is markedly ophidian. Its face is generally spoken of as feline-human, but there is little that distinguishes it from a serpent-human visage. In fact, it is only the presence of the fangs which make "El Lanzon's" face seem feline to some; to others, like myself, the general form of the body may make the face seem ophidian. The form is vertical, like a rearing serpant, tapering, with stylized, large scale plates frontally and natural- istic ventral scales below, in the rear (fig. 7, left). It is an idol whose chthonic aura is enhanced by its subterranean location. Why is "El Lanzon" not a quadruped like so many other, lesser, decorative feline motifs in Andean art? At least, why are feline bodily characteristics so little emphasized? If the jaguar were a dominant cultic animal, why is this not more apparent in "El Lanzon"? These are difficult questions, and this is why my statements were more a priori than a fortiori. And though I guardedly expressed uncertainty about "the sequence of adoption of these animals, especially the serpent relative to the jaguar in Andean cult practices," I tend to favor earlier cultic origin of the serpent mainly on the basis of the early Kotosh relics and "El Lanzon." Kornfield remarks that "Kauffmann Doig (1963), a Chavin specialist from Peru," indicates that the feline is "the pre- ferred motif of Chavin art." I must correct this impression pointedly. Kauffmann Doig, in more recent work (1972:168-72, translation mine),' describes the zoomorphic elements in the Formative period of Chavin lithic art in terms that clearly support my own position: "Representations of the jaguar are rare in the lithic art of Chavin ... individual or preponderantly feline representations are exceedingly scarce.... The serpent occurs in many cases, and frequently its mouth with fangs, sometimes with a single fang in front, has superficially been taken for a feline mouth. Andean myths (coastal and highland) revolve especially around birds and serpents; and [only] sec- ondarily around felines.... the serpent-bird is representative of the entire Mesoamerican mythology." The monkey, viscacha, frog, etc., are minor motifs at Chavin. Kauffmann Doig observes (p. 170) that eagles and falcons are the animals most frequently represented. They may have been portrayed for purely decorative reasons, as symbols of the sun, or, at best, as deities. It is important to note, however, that there is no trace of avian characteristics in the supreme idol "El Lanzon"-"For the rest, no ornithomorphic allusions are revealed" (p. 218, translation mine).2 In fact, Kauffmann Doig believes (p. 218 n. 19) that the eyes of this idol are very sug- gestive of a serpent's, considering that avian symbols are absent. Thus the view of Bennett, Tello, and others that the feline motif is dominant is squarely opposed by the views of Kauff- mann Doig. Obviously, a line should be drawn between purely decorative uses of animal motifs and those pertaining to cult. The emphasis placed by Kauffmann Doig on bird and serpent myths is significant. If we accept his experience and scholar- ship, as certainly both Kornfield and I do, it is not the jaguar, but the serpent, which emerges as the stronger candidate in cultic competition. The Kotosh finds, being meagre, may only hint at this. "El Lanzon" seems to express it more forcefully. The importance I accord the serpent in cross-cultural studies rests on no weak base. IV Bolton astutely remarks (presumably in a South Asian con- text) that the problem facing an antidiffusionist, such as my- self, is a surfeit of information. He cites examples purporting to oppose those I selected in support of my statements that the serpent in the Americas symbolizes weather and moisture and agricultural bounty and not, as in Hinduized South Asia, human fecundity. Bolton's examples are ill-chosen. He re- casts my proposition and then proceeds to lay bare its inade- quacy without regard to the literature I have cited. Careful readers will recall that I have throughout emphasized with examples a religious or "cultic" approach, utilizing folk- lore when it complemented a known religious outlook or if it was the only available information. This is not to say that folklore is to be shunned; however, I will show how fragile this criterion can be when folktales lack a firm religious base. Now, in India, as in the Near East, particularly Mesopotamia and Elam, serpents are the attributes of several deities who are regarded with ambivalent fear and veneration (Vogel 1926, Frankfort 1939, Mundkur 1976a). The important Hindu god, Siva, has both phallic and serpent emblems, though he is not typically a "functional" deity equivalent to Mudamma, who is primarily an ophidian goddess who presides over the sacred function of procreation. Indian serpent lore stresses, among other things, childbearing as a divine boon mediated by the Nagas and Naginis, though, in some parts of India, these mythical creatures are more apparent in religious litera- ture and art than in folklore. Serpents, conceived as semi- divinities, as a tribe are delightful and virile seducers who bring about much-desired childbirth. Serpents, as animals, do not ordinarily figure in folklore as evil, detestable instruments that impregnate women and for this reason must be killed. The Indian and Mesopotamian motif of entwined serpents is the standard fertility emblem par excellence, with scarcely a con- ceptual equivalent in the religious or decorative art of the Americas. The Andean folkloric examples chosen by Bolton are not rooted in religion and on closer inspection turn out to be no parallels at all to the Hindu cases. The point is not that seducer-serpents do not occur in Andean tales, or even that Nagas and Nagin-is are extremely prominent in Hindu art, but that serpents disclose fundamentally different cultural out- looks in Indian Asia and in the Americas. Bolton's examples, far from justifying his criticism, rebound in my favor; he ignores the deeper meanings of the anecdotes he has cited, though they are obvious in the original versions. Initially thin and lithe, the seducer-serpent in the Quechua tale is evil; he waxes fat and red on the blood he sucks from the young girl he has seduced. Her parents spitefully bludgeon him on the head when they discover their daughter's pregnancy. She aborts, not humans, but a multitude of baby serpents, which also are killed (Arguedas and Stephan 1957:152-54). The Paez superstition recounted in my article, though seem- ingly suggestive of a transfer of fertility symbolism from jaguar to serpent, reflects a similar aversion to seducer- serpents. This P'aez creature performed no sacred function. On the contrary, the sacred lake in which he dwelt was ac- tually drained, perhaps less than 50 years ago, to extirpate his potential for evil. I could cite similar Andean tales illustrating my contention that, in general, the serpent's role in child- bearing is a fearful, malicious, and undesirable one and there- does not correspond with that of the Nagas. The latter, if sometimes malicious, are at least desirable. Bolton 's own ex- amples of potions derived from serpents bespeak their medicinal 1 "Las representaciones de jaguar son contadas en el arte l'itico de Chav'in ... representaciones individuales o preponderantemente felidas son escasisimas.... La serpiente esta presente en muchos casos y, con frecuencia su boca con colmillos, algunas veces con un solo colmillo delantero, ha sido estimada superficialmente como boca de felino. Los mitos andinos (costa y sierra) giran especial- mente alrededor de aves y de serpientes; y en segunda instancia sobre felinos . .. la serpiente-ave es representativa de la mitologia mesoamericana toda." 2 "En lo demas no se descrubren alusiones ornitomorfas." Vol. 17 * No. 3 * September 1976</page><page sequence="22">potential. Klauber (1972:1193-1201) lists a large number of medicinal uses with sexual connotations. They frequently reflect antagonisms and fear of the serpent. The ascription of contraceptive and abortifacient properties to various rattlesnake parts is common not only in the Andes, as Bolton says, but also elsewhere in the Americas. Should not serpents qualify as symbols antithetical to fertility on the basis of Bolton's reasoning? Francisco de Avila (1968[1598?]:39) records a Quechua myth about two serpents and a double-headed toad. Together, they tempt a woman into adultery by causing her husband to be sick. The situation is corrected by killing them. Is not the toad in this and similar Andean cases a "fertility symbol," particular- ly because toads, frogs, and serpents are grouped together in such fables (Roca Wallparimachi 1966)? Frogs and toads never play this role in Indian religious symbolism. The fragility of folkloric criteria as opposed to the more stable ones rooted in cult or religion is apparent in ancient Peruvian myths featuring Amaru, a monstrous, double-headed serpent listed by De Avila under "Dioses y Heroes" (pp. 97, 99). A malignant lake-dwelling creature, it steals the hoar- frost flower-the very germ of rain. In more recent Quechua folklore, there are versions in which the serpent is replaced by a bull, but the ancient name Amaru is retained (Arguedas 1970:83-86, 261-64). Amaru, the serpent, personified not human fertility, but moisture, and it was an animal to be feared. De Avila recounts a myth in which it is vengefully stabbed in the back and thereupon turns into stone. He says that the highland people of Caquiyoca scraped the stone identified with its remains and used the powder as medicine. In reminding us of the aphrodisiac and parturifacient uses of serpent meat among Andean aborigines, Bolton ignores the consideration that these erotico-medicinal superstitions are far less concerned with the desire to bear children than they are rooted in fear of the serpent's venom. Fear is the motive explicitly conveyed by one of the authors (Oblitas Poblete 1971:37, translation mine)3 cited by Bolton himself: "in their daily prayers [the Indians] do not forget to ask the divinity to tie up his dogs [-=snakes] so as to avoid being bitten; it is for this reason that snakes have unquestioned medicinal virtues." Up to early conquest times, Bolivian Indians venerated two ophidian deities, Yaurinkha and Huayra-tata. Each was as- sociated with water. The former was a lake-dwelling monster- serpent whose every movement produced earth tremors. The idol of the other, represented as a double-headed human figure with coiled serpents disposed from head to foot as its attributes, was associated with hurricane winds and fertilizing rains. On the other hand, Ekhakho, the deity of human fertility, was de- void of ophidian symbols. He was propitiated specifically by young girls seeking sexual bonds or marriage and was repre- sented as a fully anthropomorphic, diminutive, paunchy man (Paredes 1963:59, 77-79). Among the Luisefios of southern California, puberty rites for both girls and boys were part of Chungichnish worship. (These rites had their equivalent among the Dieguefios.) Girls' puberty rites concluded with their painting large geo- metric motifs upon boulders. These elongate patterns were highly suggestive of the dorsal and ventral scales of a serpent. Naturalistic renditions of serpents also figured prominently in their sand paintings. However, there is no evidence at all that serpents symbolized human fertility in these puberty cere- monies. On the contrary, Chungichnish worship was primarily "a religion of fear," the rattlesnake being "considered beyond all others [animals] the medium through which punishment falls for ceremonial offenses." It was the overseer of virtue, and its bite was the just reward for transgressing tribal customs (Kroeber 1907:fig. 4; DuBois 1908:93-99; cf. Waterman 1908: 303-4). The point of all this is not merely to show that Bolton's remarks are irrelevant and distractive, but also to suggest that the serpent is cast in ambivalent roles. Two factors-fear and moisture-dominate the endless variations of fables in the Americas; human procreation may be interwoven in these, but by itself seems to have no outstanding association with serpent symbolism comparable to that apparent in the religious myths of Hinduized Asia. If the serpent figures in folklore or tribal cult in sexual or, occasionally, human fertility contexts, it is because it has, like any other animal, flexible roles and the capacity, as it were, to alternate between the metaphoric and metonymic modes of human thought. About this, few structural anthropologists will disagree. Bolton doubts that the differences in numerological prefer- ences in Hinduized Asia and the Americas are as sharp as I believe they are. He mentions the occurrence of certain numbers in a circumscribed modern Peruvian situation and holds that they "demonstrate" exceptions to my generalized view. His argument is vitiated by his admission that both European in- fluence and aboriginal mysticism may be reflected in his ex- amples and by the fact that the number thirteen, which figures importantly in them, also has mystical value in Mesoamerica but is not auspicious among the Hindus and Buddhists. (He carelessly misrepresents me on the latter point, clearly stated in my article.) Bolton's reasoning in this matter is in line with his other statements: He reproves me for falling into the trap of unawareness, even selectivity, regarding examples which run "counter" to my numerological information. Oddly, up to the time I write this Reply, neither of the two articles (Sharon 1973, Bolton and Sharon 1976) which, we are told, "demonstrate" this has been published. When they are, we will know whether their disclosures have significant concor- dances or are superficial and pointless from the standpoint of comparative analyses. V Questions about ophiolatry in general and about fear as a prime motive in ophiolatry have been raised directly or indirectly in a few comments. Hultkrantz and McGee demand explana- tions involving such subjects as serpent symbolism and psy- chology. Hultkrantz makes the astonishing statement that "no real comparison with Old World ophiolatry can be made unless all known expressions of snake worship and ideology have been registered for the New World." Does he presume that this has been done for the Old World, or that discussion of this subject is premature? If his yardstick of "real comparison" were taken seriously, a goodly part of cultural anthropology would have come to a dead halt decades ago. McGee cannot accept my self-evident statement, made in an ethnological context, that fear, adoration, and superstitious attitudes, i.e., basic human emotions, are immutable and more reliable criteria than temporally fragile details of social customs. He says I ought to "demonstrate" this, and in the archaeological record, besides! As a scientist active until recently in experimental investiga- tions, I find McGee's thoughts on the value of documenting "exceptions" quite edifying. I "threw out" none, at least not prejudicially or capriciously, because, as I made clear, I en- countered none that were weighty. In fact, I strove hard to discover exceptions to my data and came up with only two in a dubious category-the Eskimo situation and the Paez myth. Documentation of "exceptions" of the type McGee demands can be limitless, since even the examples that other commentators and I find positive and useful are disdained by him. The physical and biological sciences afford great precision in quantification, identification, and analysis of variables. In 3 "en su oracion cotidiana [los indios] no olvidan pedir a la divinidad, que ate sus perros [= culebras] para evitar su morde- dura; es por esta raz6n que las culebras tienen virtudes medicinales insospechadas." 450 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="23">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS addition, the nature of the data is often such that it can be expressed succinctly. Yet, it is not customary for researchers unduly to expend space in their periodicals with details of negative, i.e., rejected, information of the kind McGee would like to see. The descriptive and interpretative nature of the symbolic content of myths makes his expectation virtually impossible to satisfy in the present instance. It was up to McGee to point out examples, if he could, contradictory to mine. I would then have reasoned with him about their relevance or otherwise. I have done exactly this in the cases pointed out by Bolton, Tu Er-wei, and Schubert and indicated the hazards of lightly invoking interpretations which violate not only known religious sentiments, but also the distinctions I specifically make. I will not for a moment deny that symbolism and structural- anthropological interpretation are important, interesting, and deserve attention. They are bound to provide fodder for in- terminable debate, as they often have in the past (Leach 1974). But are not Hultkrantz and McGee asking too much? The main thrust of my article is in other directions, and it is not critically dependent upon a discussion of matters that are more within the purview of religious psychology. The latter is hardly an appropriate subject for debate for our purposes, though it has been necessary for me to voice my view that ophiolatry is rooted in fear. There are limits to the extent to which an author can be expected to cater to a critic's predilections. Rapport with Hultkrantz and McGee was obviously impossible. Their demands seem as excessive to me as, I am sure, mine would seem to them were I to insist, in their writings, on theoretical considerations dear to my way of thinking but only subordinate to theirs. Well, chacun 2 son gout! Certainly, as Hultkrantz says, religious sentiments seek expression through animal symbolism, but I disagree with him 100% when he says that "it is not the natural object that provokes religion." My point is that the serpent has done precisely this, inciting not so much a whole religion as cultic veneration. The serpent, in my view, has provoked veneration primarily through the power of its venom. My readers will judge this for themselves on the basis of the numerous examples I have provided and the bibliographic support. My remarks on fear as an inciter of veneration are treated lightly by both Hultkrantz and McGee. Perhaps it is hard for them to en- vision the experience of peasants dwelling in the company of venomous serpents. Perhaps they are unaware of snakebite mortality statistics; or it may be that they have bypassed at least three important works cited very early in my article- Vogel (1926), Klauber (1972), and Hastings (1956). In any case, I do not favor complex psychological explanations, no matter how elegant they may seem to some. There is ample direct evidence that ophiolatry is to an extraordinary degree rooted in elementary fear of the serpent's venom. This is apparent in ancient religious texts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, particularly in creation myths, incantations, charms, and general superstitious beliefs. Analogous beliefs among primitive peoples are immensely varied. I have explored the question of fear separately using just this approach and, in addition, another, which cultural anthropologists will find unusual. It includes an analysis of various biological factors-corporeal, physiological, behavioral, and ecological peculiarities of venomous serpents-peculiarities which make them uniquely impressive among animals that incite fear by virtue of qualities which, to use structuralist's terms, make them "bonnes a penser" and "suggest modes of thought" (Levi-Strauss 1962:13). Such analyses were neither accommodable nor crucial in this article. When they are eventually published, they may mitigate, if not quench, both Hultkrantz's hasty assessment and McGee's intemperance by opening up vistas which, apparently, neither of them has encountered within his own sphere. VI "Classical" diffusionist arguments are voiced by two persons- Kaneko and Tu Er-wei. I will answer Kaneko only briefly on the question of South Asian trans-Pacific contacts. My position is clearly spelt out, and I have amplified it above. In terms of human biology and physical anthropology, it is fundamentally incompatible with the diffusionists' position. I do not regard their criteria of art, technology, or religion as invalid per se, though they are useful only as criteria; it is the specific arguments based on them which I find unacceptable. Furthermore, these arguments fly in the face of scientific ones. If the dif- fusionists' arguments in the fields of religion, art, calendrical systems, etc., were substantial, if they left no room for the possibility of independent invention, and if their evidence were acceptable to archaeologists and iconographers, the scientific data would indeed be puzzling. These threats seem remote to- day. I have of course utilized only one criterion, human blood- group genetics, since recent information makes this a powerful scientific tool. I have not gone deeper into calendrical systems because it is a specialized topic needing lengthy consideration. My own view is that this endeavor and cognate fields of astronomy leave much opportunity for independent thought and identical conclusions among diverse peoples. They are, after all, based on observations of nature and astronomical computations. Noriega (1954:275) shows how similar computa- tional practices regarding the 260-day calendar were among the ancient civilizations of India, China, the Near East, and Egypt. The problem of symbols connected with it, however, is a separate one, susceptible to many interpretations. Kaneko defends Heine-Geldern without actually spelling out her own position. Heine-Geldern's 1966 paper, cited by me, is a clear summation of the views expressed in the earlier papers listed by Kaneko. It leaves no room for misconception. It is only that his views are at odds with the requirements of the antidiffusionists. In questioning his most basic assumptions, I am not alone. I need only mention the very important objec- tions voiced by Caso (1964) against the similar assumptions of another diffusionist, Kirchoff (1964), and point again to Willey's (1974:329) statement about the serious lack of any archaeological support for the diffusionist position. On Kaneko's Point 1, the answer is yes. Heine-Geldern on the matter of trans-Pacific contacts between South Asia and the Americas is, by any reasonable criterion, a diffusionist. I should be surprised if anyone who has read Heine-Geldern's 1966 article doubted this. Answers to her Points 2, 3, and 6 may be spotted in my article and in Sections I and III above. Her statement that the "blood-group question . . . was not discussed in Heine-Geldern's lifetime" is erroneous. The works of Boyd (1950), Garn (1957), and Coon (1965), to name only three directly impinging upon transoceanic contacts, appeared while Heine-Geldern was still active. It is quite appropriate to say that he did not think in terms which were remote from his own very circumscribed endeavors. Caso (1964) fully and effectively rebuts Kaneko's Point 3, and I endorse his stand entirely. I appreciate the interesting "parallels" published by Heine-Geldern, but I reiterate my wholly rejective evaluation of his conclusions. In Point 4, Kaneko defends him on a theme in Indian art about which she apparently knows little. I must repeat that in Indian art elephants are almost invariably "naturalistically" represented; they are rarely stylized, at least never exaggeratedly. Their ears, in any case, are un- failingly emphasized. One only need compare the earless "elephant," a simple "naturalistic" image from El Salvador (Heine-Geldern 1 966a: fig. 14) with the Pallava, Chola, Gupta, Pala, and Sena Period elephants from India and South Asia copiously illustrated in Zimmer (1960:2). This applies to Vol. 17 * No. 3 * September 1976 451</page><page sequence="24">Amaravati elephants as well; elsewhere I have reproduced a portion of an Amaravati frieze with elephants in a meander motif (Mundkur 1975:fig. 2) and presented a bibliography on elephant-headed deities in India. Comparisons of elephants and makaras in Indian art and their Mesoamerican "counterparts" are, I am afraid, not rewarding as efforts towards proving India-America links or showing that Heine-Geldern has in any conceivable way been misconstrued. Tu Er-wei's comments on the diffusion of cultures puzzle me. He initially says that he does "not differ with [my view] that the serpent myths of the Americas have been influenced by those of Siberia and China"-even though I never at any point compared the myths as such (i.e., as stories) from these regions, but confined myself to a few broad archaeological and ethnographic considerations. He concludes by saying that "the influence of India on the Americas in the case of serpent myths appears to be undeniable." There is something surely amiss between these mutually irreconcilable remarks. Stressing the criterion of the cardinal directions (and the number four automatically suggested by these), he says that "this myth conception may have come from India" to Mexico. He forgets the numerous very basic differences in the mystic values assigned to various numbers. In India, the numbers thirteen, twenty, and fifty-two do not at all possess the mystic significances so characteristic of them in Mesoamerica. Now, the body of Hindu religious myths recorded in the Puranas is incredibly immense. For example, the myth of Durga as Mahi?asuramardini, in which the goddess, riding a feline (a Mesoamerican favorite!), slays a buffalo-headed demon, is a prominent theme in Indian sculpture and painting and occurs in Southeast Asian art as a cultural import. Nothing remotely like it is known in Mexico. Many similarities involving deities of the cardinal directions might be expected if India had in- deed exported her culture to Mexico. Tu Er-wei, and others who see great significance in trifles of the kind adduced as evidences of cultural influences, would be hard put to offer us really acceptable similarities in iconography. In Indian art, iconographic conventions are highly developed and intimately reflect the Puranic myths. Iconographic traditions in Mexico are also highly developed, but in radically different ways. Again, diffusionists, and those who point out "similarities," ignore the most basic differences which divide the cultures of Indian Asia and Mexico in matters of religious art. Tu Er-wei attempts to build a case on the basis of superficial similarities in mental images prompted by the cardinal direc- tions and their automatic suggestion of the number four, and of deities who send rain, wind, fire, or light from the four quar- ters. He incorrectly states that, in India, the four wardens of these quarters "later" proliferated to eight. A set of eight Hindu deities, known as Dikpalakas, presides over the clirec- tions. All eight were prominent in the Vedic period (mid-2d millennium B.C.), long before Brahma, Visnu, and Siva of the Trinity gained ascendency. Dikpalakas are described in detail by Gopinatha Rao (1914, vol. 2: 515-38). Besides, there are eight elephants, the Dig-Gajas, who protect the eight points of the compass. If, as some diffusionists allege, Indian ele- phants have artistic counterparts in Mexico, is it not odd that this animal, so beloved in the mythology of India and so com- mon in her art, is conspicuously omitted in Mexican references to the four directions and the Mexican deities whose "similari- ties" to the Hindu are allegedly the products of "influence"? Each of these four Mexican deities, as Tu Er-wei agrees, had pronounced serpent symbols. None of the eight Dikpalakas had serpent symbols, though each was assigned a different animal attribute. My point was not that the number four is missing in the Hindu religious context, but that it does not command the inordinate prominence it is accorded almost everywhere in the Americas. My point was that three (rather than four) is the "magic" number among the Hindus. Apte (1890:482-83, 548-52) lists the meanings, in Sanskrit, of chatur ("four") and tri ("three"), along with their cognates. The entries of a re- ligious nature under tri and cognates are by far the more numerous and impressive. Tu Er-wei should note that the god Kubera, the Regent of the Northern Quarter, has an epithet rooted in the number three; he is, in addition, sometimes repre- sented as three-legged (Apte 1890:410). I must flatly contradict Tu Er-wei's espousal of lunar as- sociations of the four Hindu deities he has compared with the four Mexican ones. In Vedic hymns, Agni personifies fire, and he is constantly associated with the sun in simile and metaphor- "the sun became visible when Agni was born" is one example; Indra, as the rain and weather god, is distinctly identified with, and directly addressed as, the sun; Mitra, as god of the day, regulates the course of the sun-a belief more amply evident in the Persian Avesta; Varuna is primarily a solar god, "sun- eyed," and his chariot "shines like the sun." None of these four Hindu divinities mentioned by Tu Er-wei possesses serpent attributes. Their solar associations are extremely pro- nounced; the lunar are not evident or are hardly ever referred to. The literature in support of this is so plentiful that I cannot begin to cite it. Tu Er-wei should refer to Macdonnell (1963) and to my reply to Schubert below. Now, regarding the Mexi- can deities: Tlaloc, the ophidian rain god, personifies the nega- tion of the sun's desiccating effects and is to be considered more in solar than in lunar contexts (Garcia Payon 1975:166-68); Xiuhtecuhtli, like the Hindu Agni, personified fire, the sub- stance of the sun, but, unlike Agni, carried a serpent with solar associations, the symbolic Xiuhcoatl. This serpent symbol was also borne by Huitzilopochtli/Tezcatlipoca, two aspects of one and the same solar divinity (Palacios 1935:253-55; Sejourne 1957:182-89). In Mexico, the solar cult in general commanded distinctly greater importance than the lunar. The solar as- sociations of the serpent are correspondingly far more evident than the lunar. Tonatiuh, the sun god, was represented in art as a disc either with bifid, serpent tongues corresponding to rays emanating from the cardinal points or with a serpent encircling the sun-face (Beyer 1921:149 and fig. 25). The symbol of the moon god, Tecciztecatl or Meztli, was not a serpent but a large shell in front of his head (Burland 1967:97). If Tu Er-wei had examined authoritative literature in Spanish or English before drawing his analogies, and if he had compared icons of the Hindu and Mexican deities, I am confident he would have had little to disagree with me about. The differences of iconography, mythology, and numerology are as sharp as I assert they are. Similarly, the correspondences cited by Tu Er-wei regarding American tribes such as the Winnebago are no more than a veneer which obscures facets of Hindu myth- ology that invalidate the similarities he imagines. To sum up: My contention is that similarities of the type considered above depend upon imprecise and flimsy precepts; that elemental cultural dissimilarities are submerged by super- ficial analogies; and that such analogizing appears to be un- inhibited by the data from human biology and the cautions urged by physical anthropologists. VII In conclusion, I wish to make a few very brief statements: My observation that the Northwest Coast tribes are one of the oldest aboriginal stocks in North America is not accurate. I thank Hultkrantz for pointing this out. Kubler questions the correctness of my giving equal weight to primitive societies and civilized peoples in the Americas. I see no harm in this at all, since the latter only continue tra- ditions derived from their primitive past. Orme's (1974) review discusses the general matter of parallels, and his work should be consulted for further details. I agree with Schubert's useful observation that Vrtra-Ahi is functionally equivalent to the sun in the sense that, like the 452 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="25">Mundkur: CULT OF THE SERPENT IN THE AMERICAS sun, this serpent-demon is the cause of terrestrial desiccation (he monopolizes all available water by drinking it up). This symbolic equivalence, however, is created only in the modern mind, and it illustrates the hazards of placing undue emphasis on symbolism without reference to a firm religious base, as some of my psychologically oriented colleagues might be tempted to do. Actually, the situation is exactly the opposite of that imagined by Schubert. In Hindu religious literature (Satapatha BrahmaUa I, 6, 4[18]), Vrtra-Ahi is identified with the moon, Indra being the sun. These personifications are apt, since Vrtra-Ahi is the antithesis of the solar Indra, the slayer of the serpent-demon. This event is likened to Indra's "swallow- ing" of the lunar Vrtra-Ahi at new moon. I thank Onuki for supplementing my examples of ancient Peruvian serpent representations and for calling my attention to more accurate dating of llama bones at Peruvian sites. Kelley seems impressed by Mackenzie's Myths of Pre- Columbian America. I cannot think of a better way of convincing my readers how astray in adjudication a commentator oc- casionally can go than by recommending that they read this book. Kelley calls it a source of "verifiable detail." It was written more than a half-century ago, when the great ar- chaeological discoveries of Mesoamerica and the Andes were incompletely docuinented or interpreted and physical anthro- pology was still in its infancy. We cannot fault Mackenzie for his literary efforts. That Kelley champions the conclusions expressed therein, largely on the murky subject of diffusion of cultures from South Asia to Mexico, leaves one wondering whether he has consulted the literature I have cited or read Mackenzie's book and my article perspicaciously. I am mildly perplexed at the attitudes of only two of my colleagues-McGee and Hultkrantz. Their remarks, which I have tried to answer where possible, at times reflect an inac- curate estimate of my views. This in itself is not disquieting- not even McGee's absurd claim that my examples do not show that the serpent in the Americas reflects values different from those in South Asia or the fact that he sneers at the in- formation from human genetics. Readers will draw their own conclusions. McGee's remarks finally verge on diatribe, and this has stifled debate. The very wide range of topics I have compressed here can be expected to suffer some inadequacies of exposition. However, much of my information-the data on blood groups, archaeology, or religious symbolism, for ex- ample-must surely be new to these commentators and perhaps difficult for them to understand or evaluate. If they choose to ignore these, or interpret parts of my article differently, that is their privilege. Still, when Hultkrantz pronounces on its shortcomings, suggesting that it "could leave the impression that we are not yet ready for this sort of work," he does not, I hope, presume to speak on behalf of other commentators and readers. Otherwise, the approval of my manuscript by the referees will have been as much in vain as CA's eclecticism. Writing for CA has given me much pleasure. I would re- iterate almost everything I have stated, with many more ex- amples where space permitted. I am especially touched at not having been spared the candor which normally typifies CA's comment columns; not being formally trained as an archaeologist or anthropologist, I wish to be corrected within the latitudes I allow myself. I appreciate this candor the more in that it has enabled me to shed inhibition, meet my colleagues on their own ground, and show what I think are some of their own inadequacies. I thank all my colleagues for the courtesy they have shown me by reading my manuscript and stimulating a discussion. References Cited ABRAMOVA, Z. A. 1967. Palaeolithic art in the U.S.S.R.
