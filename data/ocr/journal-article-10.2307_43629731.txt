<plain_text><page sequence="1">ÊNÎTE'S DOMINION OVER THE HORSES: NOTES ON THE COALESCENCE OF PLATONIC AND HAGIOGRAPHIC ELE- MENTS IN AN EPISODE FROM HARTMANN'S EREC It is generally agreed that interpolations, excursuses and amplifications of source material by a later adapter warrant close examination as a guide to the adapter's - and, frequently, the original author's - interpretative aims. It sometimes transpires that the adapter, through his interpolation, has insinu- ated a different, even a subversive, perspective on the source material he professes 'merely' to be expounding. Hartmann von Aue reveals himself to be an enthusiastic practitioner of this art of the reinterpretative interpolation (which draws heavily upon the techniques of rhetorical inventio and amplificatio) in his first Arthurian romance, Erec } Hartmann's Erec represents an adapta- tion of Chrétien de Troyes 's Erec et Enide. The purpose of this article is to consider one such instance of an inter- polation, for which no direct precedent exists in Chretien's romance. In the episode in question (3440-71), the eight horses which Erec had captured from would-be robbers and then entrusted to Enîte as a punishment for her breaking silence (contrary to instruction, she had warned him of the robbers' presence), miraculously calm down, and evince loving submission towards their new mistress: vrouwe Enîte nam dô diu. vordes wären ir driu: nû wurden aller ahte. si vuorte si als si mähte: si enkunde niht wol dà mite, swie verre ez wider vrouwen site und wider ir reht waere, si leit ez âne swaere mit senftem gemüete: daz lêrte si ir giiete. diu vrouwe grôzen kumber leit, wan daz si ze liebe ir leit in ir herzen verkêrte, als si ir diemuot lêrte. swer ez rehte ahten wil, sô haeten dar an harte vil ze tuone vier knehte, solden si ze rehte aht ros vüeren und bewarn,</page><page sequence="2">212 Medium jEvum lxiii.2 dâ si eine muoste mite varn. wan daz vrou Saelde ir was bereit und daz diu gotes hövescheit ob miner vrouwen swebete und dâ wider strebete daz ir dehein grôz ungemach von den rossen niene geschach, sô waere kumberlìch ir vart: des wart diu vrouwe wol bewart. ouch muosten durch einen seihen kneht diu ros gerne und durch reht ir ungestüemez streben lân und senfteclîchen mite gân. (3440-71) (Lady Enîte then took them [the horses]. Formerly, there had been three of them; now there were eight all told. She led them as best she could, but was unable to cope very well with them. However much it might be against a lady's custom and against her status, she suffered it without complaining [and] with a gende spirit; her kindness taught her that. The lady suffered great hardship; yet she turned her suffering into joy in her heart, as her humility taught her. Whoever considered the situation properly [would perceive that] four squires would have had great difficulty managing if they were to lead and care for the eight horses properly, whereas she had to accompany them alone. Had not Lady Felicity been willing to assist her and had not Divine Courtesy hovered over my lady and ensured that no great discomfort was inflicted on her by the horses, her journey would have been arduous: but the lady was spared this. Moreover, for the sake of such a squire, the horses were willingly and properly able to abandon their impetuousness, and to accompany her gendy.)2 The narrator attributes this miracle primarily to the intervention of Lady Felicity, vrou Saelde (3460), and Divine Courtesy, diu gotes hövescheit (3461), on Enîte's behalf. Superficially, the interpolation under discussion would seem to afford yet another instance of Hartmann's narrator siding with Ênîte 'against' Êrec, so demonstrating that she has advanced further towards the ideal of marital reconciliation and balance than has her unjustly over-zealous hus- band. It must be asked, more specifically, how Hartmann's recourse to a version of myth which (it will be argued) fuses Platonic with hagiographie elements illuminates Ênîte's preparation for assuming (or reassuming) her role as queen.3 Interpolations and amplifications of a source romance frequently intro- duce material of an avowedly learned kind (catalogues of astronomical- astrological or botanical material, lists of precious stones, and so forth) that has been patently lifted from the Latin encyclopaedic tradition. Such is the case with, for example, sections of Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneide ; and Hartmann himself moves in this direction in his subsequent descriptio or ekphrasis of Ênîte's fabulous palfrey (7286-7766). In the episode under dis- cussion, by contrast, Hartmann deploys a much wider and more eclectic range of material in a manner that militates against a simplistic categorization</page><page sequence="3">Ênîte's Dominion over the Horses 213 into learned and popular sources. Even his handling of the Latin school tradition proves to be not simply derivative of a single source, as a brief consideration of the figures of vrou Saelde and diu gotes hövescheit, whose role it is to shield Ênîte from the wild, uncontrolled horses (3460-7), will show. Identifying these two principal agents of the equestrian miracle, and trac- ing their mythological and literary pedigree, presents a number of problems that will merely be adumbrated here. This applies particularly to diu gotes hövescheit , generally assumed to be a neologistic coinage of Hartmann's (though analogues occur in languages outside Middle High German).4 In Hartmann's Erec , the concept of Divine Courtesy evidendy carries connotations of, or else presupposes, the idea of God's mercy, possibly even of divine grace,5 dramatically and decisively extended to an unjusdy persecuted person of noble breeding who finds herself in extremis - a reading corroborated by Gottfried's Tristan , where îsôt, devising the stratagem of the ambiguous oath that will pre-empt a negative verdict at her trial for adultery, entrusts herself to, and even presumes upon ¡gotes hövescheit ( Tristan , 15,55 6).6 We are on firmer ground as regards vrou Saelde . The latter is not to be identified with Boethius' capricious Fortuna, whose frequendy unfair behaviour runs counter to this passage's central theme of justice restored. Rather does vrou Saelde transpose into the vernacular the concept of a divinely appointed felicitas that, on the contrary, preserves its beneficiary from the waywardness of Fortune.7 The cultish, and characteristically late Roman, invocation of such blessings for the emperor {felicitas imperatorie i), is renewed from the tenth century onwards in such Latin historical writings as the Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus and the anonymous Vita Heinrici IV imperatori s * By in effect conferring imperial-style felicitas upon Ênîte, Hartmann at once elevates her beyond her knightly husband in the short term (almost as if she were momentarily un- dergoing a kind of apotheosis) and guarantees a successful conclusion to her journey (leading to her reinstatement as queen) in the long term. What status is to be accorded vrou Saelde and diu gotes hövescheit? Are they to be classed as 'external' deities subsisting essentially in their own right, or rather as personifications of 'inner' qualities, virtues practically, already la- tent within Ênîte, and timeously surfacing in response to a crisis - or, con- ceivably, as divine attributes? Save at the risk of anachronism, the distinction between cosmological and moral forces, between myth and allegory, cannot easily be maintained. The position is complicated still further in the twelfth century by the diffusion of the 'emanationist' theology (or philosophy) epito- mized by the Cosmographia of Bernardus Silvestris.9 Yet the dramatic style in which the two powers, vrou Saelde and diu gotes hövescheit , interpose themselves in order to put to right a manifest injustice tends to confer upon them the status of goddesses, deae ex machina virtually, acting (like the classical Nem- esis, or the Blessed Virgin) largely independently of Ênîte herself. Parallels of a general rather than specific kind can be demonstrated with certain of the Latin school authors (or auctores) who formed the staple diet of the twelfth- century curriculum, and who were gready esteemed by writers associated</page><page sequence="4">214 Medium ¿Evvm lxiii.* with the much debated 'School of Chartres' (whose heyday, let it be noted, lay almost half a century earlier). Myth coalesces with allegory as late classical writers and their twelfth- century successors rework the motif of the pair of deities co-operating to ensure the prosperity of their protégé, who may thereby find himself perma- nendy elevated to quasi-divine status. According to Martianus Capella (De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii ), for instance, Jupiter and Juno together preside over the divine council that approves the marriage of Mercury to the soon- to-be-deified Philology (90-5). 10 The second book of Boethius' De consolatione Philosophiae offers an interesting variant of the motif, in as far as the personi- fied figure of Philosophia introduces, and in a sense sponsors, Fortuna, with whom she is on another level at odds. Fortuna willy-nilly and despite herself, Philosophia avowedly and directly, both contrive in their different ways to liberate man from his preoccupation with material goods and worldly values.11 In the second half of the twelfth century, Alain de Lille introduces into his cosmological epics some permutations of the motif of the co- operating deities which characteristically lend it a new Chris tian-Neoplatonist slant. Thus the eloquent Natura of Alan's De planetu Naturae insists that she fashions man not after her own inspiration or following some whimsical design, but in accordance with the divine model (vi, prose).12 She essentially characterizes herself as the junior partner in the creational exercise. In book iv of the same author's Anticlaudianus ,13 Racio, with Prudencia/Fronesis, ini- tiates the ascent to the divine throne, a heavenly journey that will culminate in Prudentia's obtaining the soul of the New Man from the Creator (iv.239- 41). Book viii of the Anticlaudianus tells how Fortuna and her daughter Nobilitas co-operate to endow the New Man with gifts (viii.63- 1 30). 14 The deeper parallel with Hartmann's interpolation evoking the interven- tion of Lady Felicity and Divine Courtesy to liberate the hard-pressed Ênîte lies, then, not in the identity of the specific deities involved, but rather in the narrative and, ultimately, moral pattern as it relates to a mortal (or erstwhile mortal) who is singled out for divine favour. Such epics as Martianus' De nuptiis and Alain's Anticlaudianus are informed by ideas of apotheosis and rebirth or re-creation, the latter an enormously popular motif in various areas of the intellectual life of the twelfth century.15 Hartmann's deities, on the other hand, do not so much effect as acknowledge Ênîte's moral regen- eration, enabling her to cope with the recalcitrant horses on a physical level. This is not to preclude the possibility of an allegorical reading, however. For the tangled undergrowth of the forest in which the eight horses threaten to overwhelm Ênîte, may be interpreted as a moral-cos mological integument of the enormous effort invested by the heroine in her endeavour to free herself from the luxuria of Karnant, and so create order out of moral chaos.16 A rather different set of analogues can be uncovered, however, if we focus on the motif of the obedient or helpful animal. The most obvious analogue is suggested by the lion in Chretien's Yvain, which, however, unlike Ênîte's horses (which rapidly disappear from view), accompanies and assists the</page><page sequence="5">Ênîte's Dominion over the Horses 215 hero throughout most of his remaining rehabilitative adventures.17 Yvain's lion is much more blatantly endowed with anthropomorphic features than are Ênîte's horses. Moreover, Yvain's first encounter with the lion, as it is locked in what threatens to become mortal combat with the dragon or ser- pent, occurs at a roughly equivalent point in that romance, soon after the conclusion of the first adventure of the second cycle. This is not to suggest that Hartmann consciously modelled himself on Yvain, or necessarily places his own equestrian miracle into a strict antithetical relationship to the lion episode of Chretien's romance. Rather, Hartmann has availed himself, by whatever channels, of that vast corpus of international folklore material which, in the twentieth century, has been catalogued by Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson.18 In Aarne-Thompson's classification, an entire section is de- voted to Friendly Animals (B300- 5 99). 19 Of greater, or in some instances more peripheral, relevance to Hartmann's interpolation are such motifs as B401 (Helpful horse), B 5 24.2 (Animals overcome man's adversary by strat- egy), B571 (Animals perform tasks for men), and B582 (Animals help person to success in love). Though the applicability of the generic concept of the Märchen to medi- aeval narrative has been questioned,20 it must nonetheless be countered that (1) a significant element of folklore was present in the tradition of the ro- mance already from its experimental beginnings in the fragmentary Latin Ruodlieb (c. 1060), 21 and (2) something like the rudiments of folklore research can be discerned in the coterie of mainly Anglo-Norman writers (Gerald of Wales, Walter Map, Gervase of Tilbury) attached to the court of Henry II of England. The curious tales recorded by these folkloristes devant le folklońsme include several involving horses, hardly surprisingly in view of that beast's prominence in folklore and myth: most noticeably, Gerald of Wales's scan- dalized account of the ritual inauguration of the Irish king.22 All this belongs to the wider intellectual climate of the later twelfth and the early thirteenth century. Assuredly, no such proto-folkloristic research need be postulated for Hartmann (that Chrétien could have entertained the appropriate contacts to Anglo-Norman intellectual circles admittedly strikes us as less improbable), who could (in theory at least) have borrowed the motif of the helpful animal from any number of sources, written or oral, learned or popular. If we confine ourselves to the surviving written sources, though, much direct and some circumstantial evidence can be advanced for Hartmann's having laid saints' lives under contribution in this regard. Amongst other considerations, many saints' lives afford a spectacular example of the ease with which popular material (orally transmitted legends relating to a local saint, often incorporating folklore) can be authenticated by being re- cast, as it were, in Latin dress: witness the national histories of Bede and Gregory of Tours, for instance. Saints' lives of the most disparate provenance, it is hardly necessary to recall, elaborate coundess variations upon the theme of peace (or friendship) with the wild beasts of the desert, forest or wilderness.23 Out of respect for</page><page sequence="6">2 1 6 Medium ¿Evum lxiii.2 the saint's extraordinary sanctity, that is, wild beasts lay aside their wonted ferocity (or their characteristic shyness) and gather peaceably around the holy man, sometimes bringing him food or allowing themselves to be fed by him. In this way, the harshness of the desert or wilderness is not so much mitigated as transformed into a paradise. In heraldic and iconographie tra- ditions, the topos has been perpetuated by means of the emblems of certain saints: St Jerome's lion, for instance, or St Hugh of Lincoln's swan. Within the hagiographie tradition itself, the ideal of peace with the wild beasts owes much to the often heavily stylized vitae narrating the lives of the Desert Fathers, such as St Anthony.24 The renewal of the eremetical movement in the eleventh century, moreover, associated especially with St Romuald and St Peter Damian,25 did much to revive the ideals of the Desert Fathers, and to refocus attention on their ideal of nature as it related to paradise and the wild beasts. The ideal of abandoning the city for the Western equivalent of the desert was practised with zealous austerity by the Cistercians (and others) in the twelfth century. Many a Cistercian vita of the twelfth century lauds the transformation of the forest or wilderness into a paradise consequent upon the labours and influence of a saintly pioneer, who, typically, attracts wild beasts to himself and tames them.26 If, then, as is widely postulated, Hartmann enjoyed the fruits of a monas- tic education, he could have become acquainted with the topos of peace with the wild beasts from roughly contemporary sources, as well as from more ancient writings such as the vitae patrům. Subjectively, the compassionate tone that informs Hartmann's presentation of Ênîte's plight, and of the efforts of horses and goddesses to alleviate that plight, puts one in mind of such ver- nacular hagiography as the Anglo-Norman Vie de Saint-Gile by Guillaume de Berneville. Guillaume portrays in loving detail how the miraculous hind both feeds St Giles with her milk and supports him when wounded by the arrow originally intended for her.27 In different degrees, and through different chan- nels, the Anglo-Norman vita and Hartmann's representation of the miracu- lous transformation of the horses are jointly nourished by the new subjectiv- ity of the twelfth century (focusing on Christ's humanity),28 the renewal of the eremitical movement, and Platonic speculation on the nature of nature. Yet the virtual ubiquity of the hagiographie cliché under discussion can all too easily blind us to the implications of Hartmann's reworking of the topos in the context of the first German Arthurian romance. Several recent studies have underlined the ground common to romance and hagiography at this period and pleaded for the abandonment of rigid neo- Aristotelian categories of genre.29 One must nonetheless credit Hartmann with more than casual awareness of the fact that he was turning from the still very new, and largely unexplored, genre of the Arthurian romance to the venerable corpus of the legends of the saints. This bold gesture of rhetorical inventio serves at once to imbue his version of the Êrec romance with Latin auctońtas in general, and to honour Ênîte in particular. For, by chance or by design, the hagiographie motif of peace with the wild beasts here allies itself to another hagiographie</page><page sequence="7">Ênîte's Dominion over the Horses 217 topos, that of the chaste marriage - for students of European vernacular languages, probably most familiar from the Old French Vie de Saint-Alexis 30 - which Êrec effectively imposed with his abrupt departure from Karnant. Marital relations between Êrec and Ênîte will be suspended until a compara- tively late stage in the course of their adventures, until after the couple's reconciliation as they escape from the castle of Count Oringles at Lîmors (6771-6813). To point out these parallels is not to confuse Hartmann's affir- mation of sexuality within marriage (possibly influenced by more recent developments in theology and canon law) on the one hand with the distinct strain of neo- Augustinián puritanism that underlies many saints' lives on the other. It is rather that in reconstituting such hagiographie motifs as that of the chaste marriage and the peace with the beasts, Hartmann goes beyond Chrétien in exploiting the possibilities inherent in the (at this stage) still largely untried and untested poetic venture represented by the Arthurian romance. One important, perhaps the most important, dimension of Hartmann's adaptation of the hagiographie topos in question still remains to be analysed. Through their intervention, vrou Saelde and diu gotes hövescheit call into being a paradisal community from which Êrec is still pointedly excluded. For the true significance of the topos of the saint's friendship with the wild beasts resides in the fact that he has recaptured the prelapsarian state of Adam and effected an imitation of Christ in the wilderness, as well as anticipating the final eschatological condition.31 By analogy the harmony (admittedly highly restricted and short-lived) which Enîte is granted at this point prefigures the greater and more permanent harmony she is destined to enjoy with her husband in the medium term and with all her subjects in the long term, once her queenship has been established. In terms of literary technique, a form of prefigurative typology that subsumes ever greater spatial and temporal do- mains allies itself to a more epic version of promanteusis or praemonitio?1 The epic pre figurative technique in question33 is also deployed to consid- erable effect in Alain's Anticlaudianus , where, for example, the secret pleas- ance or locus amoenus of the opening celestial council (1.5 5-106) convoked to propose and ratify the project for the creation of a New Man, is transcended by the universal Golden Age that the New Man's victory calls into being at the end of the work (ix. 3 9 1-409). Whether Hartmann would have been able to familiarize himself with a work such as the Anticlaudianus through a close reading of the original text, as distinct from picking up ideas that were merely 'in the air' (the possibility widely mooted for Wolfram von Eschenbach), might be disputed. It is less contentious to assume that Hartmann was influ- enced by Prudentius' Psychomachia , an important school text at this period, and the virtual paradigm for the apologetic appropriation of a 'pagan', or at least sub-Christian, epic (Virgil's Aeneid in this case) within the framework of the Christian economy of salvation and the multiple exegetical method.34 Prudentius' allegorical poem would alert a critical twelfth-century poet to the opportunity of virtually recasting the epic genre if (say) a loose sequence of</page><page sequence="8">ii 8 Medium JEv um lxiii.2 adventures were to be tautened in narrative terms, invested with symbolic meaning and lent greater intellectual coherence through its implicit incorpo- ration into a divine scheme. Thus the descent of the two goddesses towards Ênîte, and the corre- sponding transformation of the eight horses, achieves a relatively low-key realization of the Aristotelian-Platonic hierarchy known as the Great Chain of Being. Before Ênîte can fully vindicate her claim to queenship, to the administration of justice over her future subjects, she must first restore that inner justice which consists in the subjection of the unruly passions - here signified allegorically by the horses35 - to her will. It is perhaps not coinci- dental in this regard that Hartmann reiterates the word reht four times (3446, 3454, 3457, 3469) within the space of thirty- two lines, and juxtaposes the derivative adverbial phrase with the number eight: ťze rehte/ahť (3457-8; cf. 3454: ťrehte ah ten') . Eight, a(c)ht, traditionally signifies the cardinal virtue of justice.37 On the whole, though, Hartmann has eschewed the conventional laudatory epithets associated with the tradition of emblematic and allegorical depiction that (again broadly comparable with its Chartrian counterparts) taps the well-springs of Platonic and Christian myth. For if my thesis is broadly correct, Hartmann has not so much lifted a hagiographie topos from out of its original generic context, in the faindy negative terms that the practice of literary borrowing tends to connote, as renewed that topos in the new context of the romance by extracting and elaborating its Platonic- Chris- tian core.38 Johannesburg PETER WILLIAM HURST NOTES My thanks are due to Ms Antonia Gale for her constant encouragement and admo- nition during the preparation of this article, and to Professor Nigel Palmer for his scrupulous attention to points of detail. 1 Erec: von Hartmann von Aue , ed.

Helmut Peter (Göttingen, 1963), p. 50. 33 That typology in the strictly technical sense of biblical préfiguration and fulfilment may in practice easily overlap with poetic analogy, historical recurrence, and so forth, is well argued in R. Hollander, 'Typology and secular literature: some medieval prob- lems and examples', in Literary Uses of Typology: From the Late Middle Ages to the Present, ed. E. Miner (Princeton, NJ, 1977), pp. 3-19 (pp. 4-7) • 34 R. Herzog, Die allegorische Dichtkunst des Prudentius , Zetemata 42 (Munich, 1966), pp. 108, hi, stresses the fusion of the psychic, ecclesiological and eschatological dimensions to the Psychomachia. Cf. further H. R. Jauss, 'Form und Auffassung der Allegorie in der Tradition der Psychomachia. Von Prudentius zum ersten Romany de la</page><page sequence="11">Ênîte's Dominion over the Horses 221 Rose' in Der altfran^ösische höfische Roman, ed. E. Köhler, Wege der Forschung 42 5 (Darmstadt, 1978), pp. 301-41. In the case of Alain's reception of the Psychomachia ( Anticlaudianus, ix.1-379), though, Jauss detects (pp. 316-18, 329-30) a loosening of the Incarnational typological framework. 35 See, briefly, D. W. Robertson, Jr, A Preface to Chaucer. Studies in Medieval Perspectives (Princeton, NJ, 1962), pp. 252-6; and, with specific reference to Hartmann's Èrec, R. Combridge, 'The uses of biblical and other learned symbolism in the narrative works of Hartmann von Aue', in Hartmann von Aue: Changing Perspectives. London Hartmann Symposium 198J, ed. T. McFarland and S. Ranawake, Göppinger Arbeiten zur Germanistik 486 (Göppingen, 1988), pp. 271-84 (pp. 272-7). An extended mythographic interpretation of the horse (in this instance, the Trojan horse) as lust (luxuria), may be found in The Commentai y on the First Six Books of the 'Aenei d' of Vergil commonly attributed to Bernardus Silvestris , ed. J. W. Jones and E. F. Jones (Lincoln, Nebr., and London, 1977), pp. 102-3. 36 See above all Macrobius: Ambrosii Theodosii Macrobii: Commentarii in Somnium Scripionis, ed. J. Willis, Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana (Leip- zig, 1970), i, v, 17 (p. 18): 'Pythagorici vero hune numerum iustitiam vocaverunt.' Cf. V. F. Hopper, Medieval Number Symbolism : Its Sources , Meaning and Influence on Thought and Expression (New York, 1938), pp. 9, 25, 44, 45, 63, 77-8, 81, 85, 101, 112, 114, 204-6. An allegorical connection with justice was first proposed in connection with Chretien's romance in A. Adler, 'Sovereignty as the principle of unity in Chretien's Ereč, Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, 60 (1945), 927-8. 37 Cf. T. Latzke, 'Der Fürstinnenpreis', Mittellateinisches Jahrbuch , 14 (1979), 22-65. However, Latzke notes (p. 26) the absence of iustitia from the standard scheme of the four cardinal virtues in the panegyrics she studies. 38 Since this study forms part of a larger project on the horse-and-rider image in the mediaeval romance, certain aspects of Hartmann's interpolation have been deliber- ately held over for fuller treatment elsewhere. The analogy with the Alexander-and- Bucephalus incident still remains unexplored, important in as far as some poets endeavour to validate the genre of the Arthurian romance by direct (cf. Êrec 7 545 - 8 1) or implicit reference to the historically substantiated Latin and vernacular treat- ments of the Alexander legend. Furthermore, equestrian saints, of obvious impor- tance in the era of the Crusades (St George, St Demetrius and St Macarius, for instance), merit separate treatment (but cf. Toldo, 'Leben und Wunder') - not least because their collective influence helps to undermine the negative associations of the horse bequeathed to the Middle Ages by patristic allegory in particular (cf. n. 27 above), so indirectly paving the way for Hartmann's on the whole more sympathetic handling of equestrian motifs in Êrec.</page></plain_text>
