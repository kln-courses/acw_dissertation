ABSTRACT This paper reviews and summarizes the history of motorcycle leg protection research. This consists of a summary of the devices and concepts , as well as a description of the evolving methodology used to evaluate such devices. For over two decades members of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) along with other organizations worldwide have studied motorcycle leg protection devices toward the goal of minimizing motorcyclists' leg injuries occurring during collisions. In the early phases of this research, it was found that maintaining leg protection space during collision was possible by using certain kinds of leg protection structures. At the same time, it was also found that such devices have the potential to worsen overall rider injuries, including increased head injuries, due to effects such as rider ejection and torso pitch. Later research addressed various design concepts in search of an effective device which protects motorcyclists' legs and yet which does not worsen overall rider injuries. Up through 1989, a viable solution had not been found. The paper continues with a description of tests conducted in 1989 to further evaluate the United Kingdom Draft Specification (UKDS) for motorcycle leg protectors. These tests were the most comprehensive to date in terms of: the types of motorcycles and cars used; the leg protector designs and categories; the type of impact configurations considered; and the use of state-of-the-art test methodologies, including new motorcycle impact dummy and performance measures. Test results showed that UKDS type leg protection devices can increase both leg and head injuries, and overall injury severity. LEG PROTECTION FOR MOTORCYCLE RIDERS has been an active area of research for nearly two decades. Research into devices which potentially might protect the legs of motorcycle occupants, without increasing injuries to other parts of the body, has been pursued by various researchers worldwide. To date, this research has not found a viable solution. This is partly due to the basic nature and properties of motorcycles as vehicles; and also due to the very wide range of crash conditions under which such devices should not be injurious. Compared to car occupants, motorcycle riders are relatively exposed to their surroundings, and subject to varying impacts with outside objects during accidents. As a result, for example, leg injuries experienced by motorcycle riders vary widely in terms of type, severity, location and cause when compared to those of car occupants. The inherent complexity and multi dimensionality of motorcycle impacts makes leg protection research difficult both in terms of devising a leg protection device and in evaluating such proposed devices . In particular, leg protector research has been technologically limited with regard to test methodologies for the assessment of rider injuries, especially in the area of the leg, and with regard to providing realistic dummy motions in motorcycle/car impacts. So, in a sense, the history of leg protection research has been twofold, involving both the development of appropriate test methodologies as well as the evaluation of proposed experimental leg protectors. This paper summarizes the history of previous leg protection research and associated evaluation methods. It also summarizes the results of a 1989 series of full scale leg protector evaluation tests utilizing new test methodologies and procedures. These topics are discussed in the following order: 1032</page><page sequence="2">History of Experimental Leg Protection Devices History of Leg Injury Measurement Recent Test Results Conclusions The appendices contain additional descriptions of: A preliminary human factors evaluation of UKDS leg protectors Summary of an injury cost model used to evaluate recent test results HISTORY OF EXPERIMENTAL LEG PROTECTION DEVICES Early theories associated severe leg injuries with the trapping of the leg between the motorcycle and opposing vehicle. This led to the design and testing of various experimental leg protectors which were intended to prevent leg trapping. Examples of this type of device include: Proposed Device Time Period Ref Accessory Bars 1971 (1)* Reinforced Bar Type Leg Protectors Revised Heavy 1973 (2) Duty Crash Bars Side Protection 1975 (3) Devices Experimental Safety Motorcycle (ESM) Structure 1973-76 (4, 5) Modified Reinforced Leg Protectors Reinforced Leg Shield Fairing Device (RLSFD) 1975-81 (6) Hard Leg Protector 1984 (7, 8) Energy Absorption Leg Protectors Crash Bar with Energy Absorbing Bucket Seat 1975 (4) Soft Leg Protector 1984 (7, 8, 10 11, 12) Crushable Leg Protector 1985 (9) *Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. In addition, in later research, it was recognized that leg impacts with the opposing vehicle or other objects are an important cause of leg injuries. This recognition led to experimental leg protectors designed to retain lateral leg movement. An example of this is: - UK Draft Specification Leg Protectors 1988-89 (13) General descriptions of each experimental leg protector follow. ACCESSORY BARS Conventional Crash Bars - Initial leg protection research in the late 1960s and early 1970s, evaluated commercially available accessory bars (eg, Fig 1) to determine if these devices might prevent leg trapping between the motorcycle and opposing vehicle. These structures were generally made of loop shaped steel tubes with a 25 mm (1") outer diameter and 1.6 - 2.3 mm (1/16 to 3/32") wall thickness. Such structures were tested by, for example, Bothwell, et al (1), under contract to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) . Results indicated that these structures were too weak to protect legs during collisions and fall down situations. It was also noted that leg impacts with the bars were a source of injuries. From this study it was recommended that the strength of such structures should be increased such that they could withstand a 48 km/h (30 mi/h) broadside collision. Figure 1. Test Motorcycle with Accessory Bars, from (1) 1033</page><page sequence="3">Accessory bars were also examined via accident investigations (14, 15), which indicated that these structures did not produce differences in leg injury occurrence . REINFORCED BAR TYPE LEG PROTECTORS Revised Heavy Duty Crash Bars - Based on the results of the previous study, structurally reinforced experimental leg protectors (Fig 2) were fabricated and tested by Bothwell, et al (2). The bars were made of loop shaped steel tube with a 50 mm (2in) outer diameter and 2 . 3 mm (3/32in) wall thickness . Figure 2. Test Motorcycle with Revised Heavy Duty Crash Bars, from (2) The revised heavy duty crash bars were able to endure 48 km/h (30 mi/h) angled collisions. As a result, leg space was maintained and the leg was not trapped between the motorcycle and opposing vehicle. However, the knee and lower leg hit the LP's steel tube structure resulting in impacts which could potentially fracture the leg. Side Protection Devices - These devices, shown in Fig 3a to d, were designed to preserve leg space during broadside collisions, eliminating leg trap between the motorcycle and opposing vehicle. Construction consisted of large diameter steel tubes with reinforcement braces. Figure 3a. Figure 3b. 1034</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3c. Figure 3. Drawings of Motorcycles with Side Protection Devices, from (3) A study by Uto (3) of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) using simulated breakable leg bones in the lower and upper leg showed: Reductions in leg forces at the knee and ankle . Side protection devices reduced lower leg fractures by preserving leg space. Side protection increased the severity of upper leg fractures by changing fracture modes from simple bending fractures to twisting fractures in some cases . When looking at the dummy motion, the dummy with side protection had a greater tendency to be ejected more violently towards the opposing vehicle in a head first manner, increasing the potential for serious head injury. Experimental Safety Motorcycle (ESM) Structure - This structure, shown in Fig 4, was similar in concept to the revised heavy duty crash bars and side protection designs. Findings by Livers (4) and Bartol, et al (5) indicated that: Leg loads in the tibia and femur were lower with the ESM structure . Chest and head accelerations were generally higher with the ESM structure indicating an overall increase in potentially fatal injuries. Figure 4. Drawing of Motorcycle with ESM Structure, from (4, 5) MODIFIED REINFORCED LEG PROTECTORS Reinforced Leg Shield Fairing Device - This device, investigated by Bothwell (6) and shown in Fig 5 , seemed to reduce force concentration due to leg impact with tubular structures, as it was equipped with relatively thick knee pads on the rear surfaces of the device. 1035</page><page sequence="5">Figure 5. Motorcycle with Reinforced Leg Shield Fairing Device, from (6) When this device was tested in an angled collision the knee of the rider hit the knee pad leading to a violent somersaulting motion of the dummy. The head of the dummy was markedly flexed and the cervical area was pushed into the side of the car. Lower head motion resulting from knee contact with the leg shield structure on the motorcycle was observed. A lowering of the head is not desirable as it increases the chance of head impact with more rigid structures of the opposing vehicle. Hard Leg Protector - This device, proposed by Chinn, et al (7) of the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) , shown in Fig 6, seems to be the same concept as the reinforced leg shield fairing device. Although few details are presented, it seems to be one type of reinforced leg protector. Figure 6. Test Motorcycle with Hard Leg Protector, from (7) Results showed that this device decreased motorcycle yaw motion during angled collisions to fixed barriers and maintained leg space in a manner similar to the heavy duty bars. However, considerable forward pitching of the dummy torso and a lowering of the dummy head was observed with this device, similar to that found with the reinforced leg shield fairing device. ENERGY ABSORBING LEG PROTECTORS Crash Bar With Energy Absorbing Bucket Seat - This design, shown in Fig 7, was proposed by Bartol, et al (5) to reduce head acceleration by reducing the deceleration of the dummy. The device consisted of a reinforced type bar structure and an energy absorbing seat. Test results indicated that this device did not reduce rider injuries. Figure 7. Top View and Cross Section Drawing of Energy Absorbing Bucket Seat, from (5) Soft Leg Protector - Chinn, et al (7) reported that this type of energy absorption element, shown in Fig 8, reduced the component of dummy head velocity along the initial direction of travel of the motorcycle . Crushable Leg Protector (CLP) - The CLP, shown in Fig 9, was proposed by Tadokoro, et al (9) and was intended to prevent violent ejection towards the opposing vehicle while maintaining leg space. The CLP involved 2 concepts. One was to reduce dummy ejection caused by motorcycle impact acceleration. To achieve this, energy absorbing materials were installed. The second concept was to reduce the available leg space as much as possible since excessive leg space was considered a cause of ejection. 1036</page><page sequence="6">Figure 8. Test Motorcycle with Soft Leg Protector, from (7) Figure 9. Test Motorcycle with Crushable Leg Protector, from (9) To control leg space the width of the reinforced structure of the CLP was reduced to match the width of the dummy legs while the dummy was straddling the motorcycle. Motorcycle acceleration was decreased by about 10 percent by the CLP. Leg fractures were also reduced by maintaining the necessary minimum leg space. However, because of the preservation of leg space, the problem of dummy ejection was not solved by the CLP. LEG RETENTION LEG PROTECTOR According to the UK Draft Specification for Leg Protectors (UKDS) (20) this type of LP, shown in Fig 10, is intended to: Maintain leg space to prevent leg trapping by the motorcycle and opposing vehicle. Retain the leg within the leg space . Absorb motorcycle energy Prevent leg trap between the motorcycle and the deformed LP by means of LP detachment. The above concepts seem to be derived from a series of studies by TRRL, although published papers do not describe the leg retention and LP detachment concepts (8, 10, 11). Lateral retention is a new concept introduced in the UKDS . This concept seems to represent an attempt to restrain the leg behind the LP during impact. Such leg retention was considered in the past by JAMA and abandoned because it impaired leg movement during normal riding conditions . This was confirmed by recent studies, described below, in which leg movement tests were conducted on this type of LP. Test Figure 10. Top View of Motorcycle with UKDS Type Leg Retention Leg Protector 1037</page><page sequence="7">riders indicated that the leg was caught by the LP during typical stopping maneuvers which require riders to extend their foot down to the road surface. Recent studies by Sakamoto (13) also showed that during the collision phase, this type of LP retained the knee longitudinally and laterally, which can lead to increased leg and knee loads and injuries. The femur was subjected to combined forces resulting from increased torso pitching and lower leg retention. Leg impacts with the LP increased torso pitching not only forward but also laterally, resulting in downward head movement. This in turn resulted in increased head impact velocities and accelerations. Research by Chinn, et al (12) reported that the UKDS type of LP reduced leg injury and caused no injury increase to other parts of the body. One of the main reasons for such divergence in conclusions is considered to be due to substantial differences in evaluation methods, including impact dummies, test conditions, measured data, and injury criteria. HISTORY OF LEG INJURY MEASUREMENT METHODS As noted above, a crucial aspect of LP research is the methodology used to evaluate leg injury potential by means of full scale crash tests. This section describes a history of motorcyclist leg injury measurement methods . LEG ACCELERATION MEASUREMENT - During early motorcycle leg protection research, the severity of leg impacts were assessed by measuring leg acceleration with accelerometers (Fig 11) mounted on the tibia and femur. This method was used in the late 1960s and early 1970s in studies by Bothwell (1, 2) and others. This method is able to sense the motion resulting from impact. However, the impact force itself could not be determined because of the lack of information concerning impact point and direction, and the other constraint forces acting on the leg. In particular, leg bone fractures are not always associated with motion (acceleration) , but can also be caused by leg trapping or constraint forces and applied bending moments and torsional loads. As is well known, the acceleration measurement method has many limitations and in and of itself is not useful for quantifying potential leg injuries. LATERAL LEG LOAD MEASUREMENT - JAMA studies in the mid 1970s (3) measured the lateral load applied to the leg by installing load cells at the knee and ankle. The installation of the load cell is shown in Fig 12. This installation was found to be impractical for motorcycle crash testing, where the impact point on the leg varies over a wide area, and where the chances of the impact missing the measurement region were Figure 11. Photo of Dummy Leg with Accelerometers, from (1, 2) Figure 12. Drawings of Metallic Dummy Leg with Lateral Load Measurement, from (3) high. Also, bending, torsion and compression loads were not addressed. 1038</page><page sequence="8">Livers in the mid 1970s (4) measured leg loads using strain gauges on the metallic tibia and femur elements. A sketch of the strain gauge installation is shown in Fig 13. The high stiffness and strength of metallic leg bones obviously distorts the dynamic impact measurements obtained with this technique. In addition, use of a single strain gage is in general insufficient, because the forces and moments vary along the length of the bone.

Sketch of Femur and Strain Guage Installation Used in Metallic Leg load Measurement, from (4) DIRECT OBSERVATION OF LEG BONE FRACTURE - It was felt that breakable leg bones could be effectively used for leg protection research by making artificial bones which simulate human leg bones. Such breakable bones can account for fracture loads from all directions, locations, and loading modes, for example, forward and lateral bending moments, torsional moment, and compression force, and combinations thereof. Epoxy resin leg bone - Epoxy resin leg bones representing the tibia and femur (Fig 14) were used by Uto (3) to provide direct observation of leg bone fractures during testing. It was found that the epoxy resin leg bone was capable of indicating the existence of leg bone fractures and also of determining the fracture mode to a certain extent, namely whether the fracture was by bending or by torque . Bakelite leg bone - JAMA studies in the mid 1980s used 25 mm diameter laminated paper base thermo setting phenolic rods (bakelite) as a material to simulate leg bones in terms of bending and torsional strength (9) . This Figure 14. Photos of Epoxy Resin Tibia and Femur Bones, from (3) material has stable characteristics and was commercially available. This method (Fig 15) enabled researchers to observe leg bone fracture directly and subjectively evaluate the loading mode. It was also found that dummies with breakable leg bones exhibited more human like motions during impacts with leg bone fracture (17). However, torsional stiffness of such rods are low compared to human bone . Figure 15. Post-Test Photo of Dummy Leg with Breakable Bakelite Bones, from (9) White pine wood leg bone - This leg bone (Fig 16) was designed to fracture at bending loads generally similar to human leg bones (16) . It was similar in concept to the two proposed leg bones above. Figure 16. Post-Test of White Pine Wood Bone, from (16) 1039</page><page sequence="9">Lateral Leg Impact Energy Measurement - Chinn, et al, beginning in the early 1980s (8) , attempted to measure leg energy input from the lateral direction by glueing aluminum honeycomb to both sides of vertically oriented, flat metallic plates (Fig 17) . This method seems to be severely limited in its ability to determine whether leg bone fractures would occur because of the following factors: Impact energy by itself is not directly relateable to potential bending fractures . To make such a connection the magnitude, direction, location, and timing of all other externally applied and inertial loads must be determined. Analysis of dents in torn honeycomb to determine impact energy is difficult, imprecise and subject to interpretational variations . The useable measurement axis of the honeycomb is limited mostly to the lateral direction, with respect to the motorcycle centerline. However, the impacts tested by TRRL (and also specified in the UKDS) are from the forward quarter (eg, 30 degrees from the vehicle centerline) . Fractures caused by transmitted loads (for example, an upper leg bending fracture due to trapped lower leg plus hip motion) are not caused by impacts per se, and therefore cannot be monitored by an impact sensitive device such as honeycomb . Several small impacts to the honeycomb can produce the same energy absorption as one large impact; however with a human, a series of small impacts would not be expected to cause the same injury as one large impact, in general . The load paths between feet, knees and hips cannot break, as they can in human bones and breakable dummy bones . This high strength distorts overall dummy motions . Shape and size of the rectangular honeycomb sections are non biofidelic, leading to distortions in leg impact and constraint forces. Stiffness of the leg does not match the human leg, therefore dynamic impact forces will be non biofidelic, resulting in further distortion of dummy motions . Recent addition of electrical strain gages to measure femur axial load and torsion (12) seems to have done little to improve this situation. This is due to the continued inappropriate stiffness and strength, and lack of bending measurements. As a result, use of this dummy leg as a basis for LP development and evaluation continues to be questioned. Figure 17. Photo of Test Dummy with Aluminum Honeycomb Legs, from (8) LOAD AND LOAD MODE MEASUREMENT OF LEG Load Sensors with Metallic Leg Bones - To further attempt to advance leg protection research, Tadokoro in 1987 (17) measured leg load modes, magnitude, direction, impact point and timing by installing load sensors in the vicinity of the leg joints. This leg is shown in Fig 18 and a list of measured items is given in Table 1. Using this technique it was possible to measure the desired information. On the other hand, it was concluded that the measured dynamic impact loads would be higher than those of human leg bone because of the metallic bone's higher stiffness and strength. This method was also found to distort dummy motion because of the non- breakable properties and high stiffness of the metallic leg bone. Load Sensor with Breakable Leg Bone - Miyazaki, et al, in 1988 (18) attempted to improve the previous methods, replacing metallic leg bones with breakable leg bones, 1040</page><page sequence="10">Figure 18. Test Photo of Metallic Tibia Bone with Upper and Lower Load Sensors, from (17) as shown in Fig 19. Issues related to measured values and dummy motion were improved to a certain extent. On the other hand the fracturable area of the leg bone was reduced to accomodate the installation of load cells and adaptors. Leg System With Load Measurement and Breakable Elements - An improved, more sophisticated leg system was developed in 1989 (19) to evaluate leg injuries in a more comprehensive manner. To achieve this, new frangible leg bones and knee joints were combined with strain gages (attached to the frangible bones) and upper femur load cells. This leg measurement system is shown in Fig 20. Measurement items and construction features are shown in Table 2. The frangible bones and knee joints were designed to match both the stiffness and ultimate strength of their human counterparts . This resulted in a device which simulates the dynamic impact response (forces, motions) of the human leg, and fractures when the resulting forces exceed nominal human bone failure levels. Strain gages and load cells are used to analyze the loading and failure modes. In addition, the combination of 3 axis (lateral bending, rearward bending, torsion), compliant, breakable knee joints and composite material leg bones is considered to contribute significantly to improved overall dummy motions . Following laboratory and full scale development tests, it was found that this leg system functioned well and was usable under crash test conditions. It was used in 1989 in a series of tests to evaluate UKDS leg protectors . In addition to the main findings, the tests verified that rider leg fracture was the result of multiple, time varying, multi axis loads which are experienced in actual crash situations, which Figure 19.

The results from this most recent study of leg protectors using this new leg system are discussed below. RECENT TEST RESULTS Background - As discussed above, research into devices which potentially might protect the legs of motorcycle occupants , without increasing injuries to other parts of the body, has continued over two decades. To date, for the substantial reasons reviewed above, this research has not found a viable solution. Notwithstanding this situation, the UK Draft Specification for Motorcycle Leg Protectors (20) was introduced in July 1987. The proposal was based to some extent on the exploratory work of TRRL over the previous several years. At the time the UKDS was introduced, there was no published information or data for devices which actually complied with the UKDS. Also the exploratory work of TRRL had been limited by methodology problems , as have been documented in more detail elsewhere. For these reasons and in order to understand and comment on the UKDS, JAMA conducted a preliminary full scale evaluation of an example UKDS type LP (13) . As noted above, these preliminary results showed that the example UKDS device did not reduce leg injuries in the 3 collision configurations tested. Also, in some cases it induced upper leg fractures, suggesting that the proposed device could increase leg injuries. In addition, in some cases the LP equipped motorcycles produced increased torso pitch, increased head velocities at impact, and increased motorcycle tumbling tendencies following impact. Following these tests, the motorcycle industry increased efforts to improve test methodologies, a long term goal which had been announced in ECE subcommittee meetings in Geneva several years earlier. The goal was to assemble an "interim methodology" which would enable a more complete evaluation of the UKDS during 1989. The improved methodologies include 6 items : More detailed accident data analyses, to establish a statistical relation between test conditions and real world accidents . Development of a motorcycle impact dummy, which would be suitable for motorcycle use and which would provide for more realistic rider three dimensional motions and forces. Development of an injury indicating dummy leg, which would simulate various leg injury mechanisms, and allow for cause/effect analysis. Development of overall injury criteria applicable to motorcycle riders, in order to be able to assess the benefit or harm to various body regions , and the relative injury costs thereof. Development of instrumentation to be self contained within the dummy (no external cables) , which records measurements related to the injury criteria, and which allows for a free moving dummy. Test procedures and plans including conditions , measurement methods , and criteria, encompassing the above . Obi ectives - The 1989 leg protector study, conducted by the International Motorcycle Manufacturers Association (IMMA) , was carried out within the industry's long range objectives for leg protection research, namely: To assess the feasibility and effects on predicted injury costs of motorcycle design alternatives which are intended to: Reduce injuries to the lower extremities of motorcycle occupants in collisions, and Not increase the overall costs of injuries resulting from collisions, and Not increase the likelihood of various types of motorcycle accidents. The specific goals of the study were to evaluate UKDS type leg protectors using: A wider range of vehicles Motorcycles Small Medium Large Opposing vehicles Sedan Coupe A wider range of leg protector designs - UKDS Categories 2, 3a, 3b - A wider range of impact configurations and conditions 1 angled car front configuration 1 offset car front configuration 2 angled car side configurations 1043</page><page sequence="13">3 car side configurations 1 car rear configuration Improved test methodology including: A new motorcycle impact dummy, MATD-1 (19) , including A new injury indicating leg with instrumented frangible tibias, femurs, and knee ligaments, A digital recording system contained in the dummy, Injury criteria including dummy head motion and leg fracture criteria, and combined injury severity indices . In addition, JAMA addressed normal (non crash) motorcycle operation with UKDS leg protectors by examining rider leg movement performance, including: Kinematic consideration Stopping tests Static simulation of braking Improvement of knee protector shape Stopping tests using refined knee protector Rider forward movement during acceleration and braking These evaluations of human factors and practical aspects led to the conclusion that the leg movement and "foot down" performance of UKDS LPs was unacceptable for production motorcycles . These evaluations are further described in Appendix A. CRASH TEST EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Test Vehicles - The motorcycles used in the 1989 crash tests were: - Small: Piaggio COSA CL 125 Scooter (110 kg) - Medium: Yamaha XS 400 SP (170 kg) - Large: BMW K 75 S (237 kg) These were selected by IMMA to be in the upper three of the four UKDS size categories. The specifications of the test motorcycles are given in Table 3. The physical appearance of the standard motorcycles is shown in Figs 21 to 23. The opposing vehicles were: Sedan Coupe The specifications of the opposing vehicles are given in Table 4. The sedan was used in previous JAMA research, for example (13), and was selected to provide a connection with that data. The coupe was chosen to represent a medium sized body style, which was available worldwide. Photographs of the opposing vehicles are given in Figs 24 and 25. Table 3.

Coupe Used in 1989 Tests UKDS Leg Protectors - Leg protectors for each of the three test motorcycle models were designed, developed, and lab tested to ensure that they met all the requirements of the UKDS. A summary of the specifications for the three different leg protectors is presented in Table 5. Photographs showing the appearance of the leg protector prototypes on the respective motorcycles are shown in Figs 26 to 28. The leg protector for the Piaggio consisted of a series of box structures integrated with the monocoque front frame of the scooter. The UKDS primary impact element (PIE) consisted of an outer metallic shell with polyurethane foam inside. The rigid support element (RSE) was integrated with the front main assembly framework and the original framework was reinforced to support the leg protector. The knee protection element (KPE) was made of polyurethane foam. The LP for the Yamaha was similar to the design used in (13). Two refinements were made in response to comments made by TRRL. The first of these was to extend the energy absorbing portion of the KPE downward. The other addition was a "smooth outer contour" in the form of a fibreglass fairing covering the PIE, RSE, and KPE.

Large Motorcycle with Protptype UKDS Leg Protector The BMW LP was similar to the TRRL design for the Norton police motorcycle, tests of which were reported in (12). The PIE was a steel sheet box, rounded on the outer surface, and filled with polyurethane foam. The RSE consisted of steel tubes. During development the tube size was progressively reduced to a level where the LP "just barely passed" the UKDS, in order to answer the TRRL concern that past LPs might have been "too rigid". The KPE was made of polyurethane foam. Test Facilities - Two crash test facilities were used in the full scale impact tests: the Japan Automobile Research Institute (JARI) , Japan; and Failure Analysis Associates (FAA) , USA. Both facilities consisted of a main rail, along which the motorcycle trolley was drawn by cable; and a series of side runways at various angles to the main rail, along which the opposing vehicle was drawn by cable. Vehicle speeds were determined by a system of pulleys in the JARI facility, and by a gear train in the FAA facility. In both cases the motorcycles were propelled to the point of impact by a four-wheeled trolley, in which the motorcycle is held by braces at the handlebar, wheel supports, and main frame, until its release just prior to impact. Figures 29 and 30 show side views of the respective trolleys with example motorcycles . Impact Dummy - A newly developed Motorcycle Anthropomorphic Test Device (MATD- 1) (19) was used in all the full scale impact tests. MATD-1 comprises a highly modified Hybrid III pedestrian impact dummy (standing kit) with: Instrumented, frangible, composite material femurs and tibias, with bending, torsional and compression strengths and stiffnesses corresponding to human bone .

Side View of FAA Motorcycle Trolley Modified head form (chin and neck areas) to accomodate a motorcycle helmet. Modified hands which allow grasping of the handlebars. No external cables . Typically, approximately 50 channels of motion data consisting of component accelerations , forces , and moments were recorded. However, only a subset of these was used in injury evaluation (as described below) , the remainder being used to provide further insight into motions and sources of inj ury . Performance Measurements - Measurements of dummy motions, forces, moments, and fracture occurrence were collected, in order to assess the relative performance of the LP prototypes. In addition, using these measurements , a number of performance indices were computed. The basic raw data upon which all the measurements were based include: High speed films of dummy, motorcycle, and opposing vehicle motions during and following impact Digitally recorded time histories of approximately 50 electronically sensed dummy motion, force, and moment variables Post- crash examination and photos of frangible elements Some of the derived performance measurements were computed at or over a certain time interval. Generally speaking the time intervals are related to 3 events , namely: Initial impact (motorcycle to car) Primary impact (of the dummy or of certain dummy parts with some larger object) Secondary impact (of the dummy with some larger object) The primary and secondary impacts refer to a variety of objects depending on the circumstances. For example, the primary head impact in many cases refers to head/car contact, although head/ground first contact occurred in one case. For leg impacts, the primary impact was with motorcycle, LP, car, or in some cases even the ground. In general, therefore, primary and secondary refer respectively to the first and second impacts between a dummy part and some larger object, irrespective of the object. Also, for purposes of calculating injury severity, injuries during the entire crash sequence were combined, including primary, secondary, and any other impact. This was done because there is no obvious rationale that would limit the effects of leg protectors to, for example, primary impact. In other words, the injury severity estimates presented herein include all the consequences, primary, secondary and otherwise, of a particular crash sequence. The following is a discussion of the central performance measurements used in the current tests. Leg Injury Indication - Frangible leg elements inspected after each impact test were : Tibias (for simple or multiple fracture) Femurs (for simple or multiple fracture) Knee ligaments (for torsional or lateral bending failure) As discussed elsewhere, these elements were designed to have force and moment versus deflection characteristics which were similar to human properties. For the tibia and femur composite material tubes, the fractures are categorized as being simple or multiple fractures. Simple was taken to mean one fracture zone. Multiple was taken to mean 1047</page><page sequence="17">either more than one fracture zone or one fracture zone with an axial extent of more than 4 mm. The latter distinction was somewhat arbitrary; however the overall results do not appear to be sensitive to this particular criterion. In the case of the knee, the torsion and lateral bending shear pins were examined. The criterion for ligament tear was whether the shear pin had been fractured into two or more pieces. In addition, multiple load cells and strain gauges attached to the leg components provided information on modes and axes of failures. However this information did not enter into the calculations of injury severity. Head Motion - High speed film (1000 fps) footage was used to measure the longitudinal (x^) and vertical ( z helmet target trajectory. These were analyzed from the time of motorcycle initial impact up through head primary impact. The longitudinal axis is parallel to the initial trajectory of the motorcycle, positive forward; and the vertical axis was perpendicular to this, positive downward, in standard SAE vehicle dynamics convention. Cross plots of xft vs z ^ show the head trajectory from the initial motorcycle impact to the head primary impact. Head trajectory was used as a coarse indicator of potential head injury, in the sense that lower head trajectories can tend to lead to more direct impacts with stiff vehicle structures, as has been noted by other researchers (21) . Of all head measures, head trajectory is the least affected by the details of the particular car structures impacted by the head and can be considered to show the most basic trends in motion. The head trajectory data (x^, y^, z^) were used to calculate a resultant head velocity time history. Then, using initial motorcycle impact as a datum for both film footage and time history, the time of primary head impact was identified in the velocity time history. Resultant head velocity at head primary impact was used as an indicator of momentum or kinetic energy with which the head struck the primary object. An alternative might be velocity perpendicular to the surface; however this is difficult to define for the many compound curved surfaces found on typical cars (eg, the roof edge). Signals from duplicate sets of triaxial accelerometers (ie, 6 accelerometers) located in the dummy head were used to calculate peak resultant head acceleration at primary and at secondary head impact. The signals were antialias filtered, sampled at 10,000 samples per second, and SAE band filtered. The resultant acceleration from each of the triax sets was calculated digitally and the average of the peak resultants from the two triax sets was computed, for the primary and for the secondary impacts . As discussed in (22) , peak resultant head acceleration is currently considered to be the most appropriate head injury indicator for helmeted heads subjected to multi axis impact. Criterion values are discussed below. Estimated AIS Levels - Dummy injuries were assessed using peak resultant head acceleration and frangible element failures based on the dummy injury criteria presented in (22) and summarized in Table 6. . This provides integer levels of injury severity corresponding to the traditional scales , namely : AIS SEVERITY 0 None 1 Slight 2 Moderate 3 Severe 4 Serious 5 Critical 6 Fatal Based on the AIS score for each body part, aggregate measures of injury severity were assessed for each impact. These were: maximum AIS for a given impact; and total AIS for a given impact. The former assumes that the worst injury is an indicator of injury severity; and the latter assumes that a linear summation of the injuries indicates overall severity. Estimated Injury Costs - Another aggregate indication of overall injury severity was based on the initial economic injury cost model presented in (22) . This uses the dummy measures to predict injury severity and then, based on economic data correlating the costs of medical treatment, disability, lost work, and ancillary expenses for various injury severities to the head and several parts of the leg, predicts an estimated overall injury cost. Note that the initial injury cost model described in (22) contains discontinuities in the cost function. These result in oversensitivity to small differences in dummy measurements in certain regions . To reduce this oversensitivity a linear interpolation method was used, as described in Appendix B. As mentioned elsewhere, such injury severity estimates are preliminary and incomplete but do provide a means to compare overall injury potential during the entire impact sequence. Other Measures - Other measures of dummy motions , forces , and moments were recorded during the current tests. These variables (eg, chest and pelvis accelerations; leg forces and moments) provide additional insight into the mechanics of impact and injury. At the current time the recorded chest and pelvis accelerations are not considered to be either biofidelic or 1048</page><page sequence="18">Table 6.

IMPACT CONFIGURATIONS Selection - Test conditions were selected on the basis of: conditions of typical use; conditions which fully exercise the features of the proposed protective device; and conditions which might indicate potential failure modes. In the case of leg protectors, typical use includes conditions for their primary intended function, namely impacts with opposing vehicles. The Hannover and Los Angeles data bases , analyzed and catalogued in (23) , were used to determine which impact configuration are known to occur. This revealed approximately 170 configurations which did occur in the respective databases , and which can be simulated in existing motorcycle/car crash test facilities (note that this is only about 10 percent of the theoretically possible number of configurations, given the parameters used in (23). From this set of 170 candidate impact configurations, a subset was selected based on the above criteria. The resulting configurations represent a wider range of impact geometries and phenomena than had been previously examined. Also, some of the configurations are among the most frequent occurring in the accident databases. Summary of Configurations - Table 7 summarizes the 8 test configurations used in the 1989 study. The first 5 of these were for the medium motorcycle. In addition, there were 2 exploratory tests for the large motorcycle; and 1 exploratory test for the small motorcycle. The first 3 configurations were tested at JARI and involved the sedan opposing vehicle; and the last 5 configurations were tested at FAA and involved the coupe. Tables 7 and 8 list the impact geometry codes which further describe the impact condition. As shown in Table 7, "fractional" car impact points were sometimes used, to account for differences in vehicle geometry . For each configuration a pair of impacts was conducted: one with the standard 1049</page><page sequence="19">Table 7.

TEST RESULTS - Figures 31 to 34 and Tables 9 to 11 summarize the resulting objective measurements for each of the 16 motorcycle/car crash tests. Effect of LPs on the Number of Leg Fractures Per Crash - Figure 31 compares the number of leg injuries per crash with the standard and LP motorcycles. In two of the configurations (A2, A3) there was a reduction in the number of leg injuries with LPs. In two of the configurations (A5 and PI) there was no change in the number of leg injuries. In four of the configurations (Al, A4, Bl, B2) there was an increase in the number of leg injuries with LPs. Number and Cause of KPE Related Leg Injuries - In five of the configurations (A2, A3, A4, Bl, PI) leg injury resulted from leg contact with the knee protection element. In one of these (PI) , there were KPE related injuries to both legs. In three cases (A2, A3, PI) the injury was an upper leg fracture during leg to KPE impact, and in two of the cases (A4, Bl) , upper leg and knee injuries occurred due to restraint of the lower leg. In one case (PI) , knee impact to the KPE deflected the foot downward beneath the car, resulting in a lower leg fracture. KPE Iniurv Mechanisms - Table 9 summarizes data related to the first four of the six KPE related leg injuries (the fifth and sixth injuries were associated with the bending failure of the trapped right knee ligament in Bl and the downward deflection of the right leg in PI, previously discussed). As shown in Table 9 , in all four of these cases , the fracture was to the left femur (the left side being the more collision involved side of the motorcycle). Also, in all four cases the femur was fractured by a 1050</page><page sequence="20">Table 8.

This is further described in Table 10, which shows the fraction of the bone strength reached during fracture, in each axis, based on the recorded leg force data. In all four cases, the compression loading was considerably below failure levels. However, substantial amounts of lateral and forward bending were present in each case, and were the dominant forces leading to fracture in cases A2, A3 and A4. Examination of the high speed film suggests that the large bending loads are associated with the concave shape of the KPE, as well as upper leg angular motions and orientation. Overall, these data indicate that upper leg bending fractures occur with the KPE; the KPE design does not prevent such fractures; 1051</page><page sequence="21">□ Standard u ^ LP z 4| " S KPE Contact ~~ " Fracture i&lt;/&gt; &lt; UJ íS 3 n n i-&lt; £E S 2 ' M V' ™ i- iZ / / õ E| iZ iT / , , H ini / õ UL&lt; ' $ Ç ň X UL&lt; °2 1 ífl ' ¿ I Fa I $ I Ç I i ň la I fa * Iftl I X œ-i pi 1 ífl I Fa I « i ra 1 1 1 i la i fa Iftl ffi A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 B1 B2 P1 S 3 Z Figure 31.

Effect of LPs on Head Trajectory - Figure 32 compares the dummy head trajectory with the standard and LP motorcycles for the 8 different impact configurations. In all 8 configurations the head followed a lower trajectory when LPs were fitted. The amount by which the head trajectory is lowered varies from about 30 mm with configurations Al and B2 to as much as 270 mm with configuration A5 . Effect of LPs on Resultant Head Velocity at Primary Impact - Figure 33 compares resultant head velocity at primary impact with standard and LP motorcycles. In configuration Al the head velocity was reduced by about one third with LPs . In all other configurations, the head velocity at impact was increased, typically around 5 percent. In configuration B2 the head velocity was nearly doubled with LPs. Effect of LPs on Peak Resultant Head Acceleration on Impact -Figure 34 compares the peak resultant head acceleration on impact with standard and LP motorcycles. The maximum peak accelerations occurring during each crash sequence are shown. Configuration B1 shows a reduction in peak head acceleration. All of the other configurations (7 of 8) show an increase in head acceleration, ranging between 15 g for configuration B2 to 90 g for configuration Al. Effects of LPs on Estimates of Iniurv Severity - Table 11 summarizes various estimates of injury severity for the 16 crash tests. These include: the individual body part AIS per (22); the total AIS for each crash; the maximum AIS for each crash as discussed in (23) ; and the estimated injury cost pér (22) , with linear interpolation as described in Appendix B. As an injury severity indicator, total AIS assumes linear weighting of the individual injuries: the more injuries which occur and the more severe the injuries, the greater the overall severity. The total AIS data show that LPs are beneficial in 2 of the 8 configurations; and LPs are harmful in 6 of the 8 configurations. Maximum AIS as a coarse indicator of injury severity has been discussed in (23) and elsewhere. The maximum AIS data show that: LPs are beneficial in 2 out of 8 configurations; LPs have no effect in 2 out of 8 configurations ; and LPs are harmful in the remaining 4 configurations . The injury cost model data describe the estimated economic costs of medical treatment, disability, lost work, and ancillary expenses as functions of body part, severity, and interactions among injuries. For example, moderate severity leg injuries can tend to be more costly than moderate level head injuries due to a relatively higher disability cost. Serious head injuries, on the other hand, have higher costs than serious leg injuries because of higher costs of medical treatment as well as disability. The injury cost data show that LPs are beneficial in 3 of 8 cases; and harmful in 5 of 8 cases . Overall, configuration A2 is the only case in which LPs are shown to be beneficial by all 3 injury severity measures. CONCLUSIONS HISTORY OF LEG PROTECTOR (LP) DEVICES - From reviewing past research, it is believed that "structural type" leg protectors located in front of the knee - with or without energy absorption, knee pads, or leg retention - are not feasible. The history of experimental leg protection devices, to date, consists of proposing concepts, testing them, and then devising countermeasures to eliminate the negative side effects of the concepts. Such negative side effects include torso pitch, resulting from restraining the lower extremities; and rider ejection, resulting from maintaining excessive leg space. 1052</page><page sequence="22">o 1000 xh(mm) 0 1000 xh(mm) _2qq i I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I _2QQ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I A1 I / I A5 o ' 0" " ^ N N x v ' ' 200 " zh(mm) 200 - zh(mm) V o 1000 xh(mm) 0 1000 xh(mm) _2QQ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I _2qo I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I A2 B1 o-^~ o- 200 - zh(mm) I ' 200 - zh(mm) o 1000 xh(mm) O 1000 xh(mm) -200 I ' ' ' ' I ' ' ' ' l ' ' ' ' I ' ' ' ' I ' ' ' ' I ' -200 I ' ' ' ' I ' ' ' 1 I 11 1 1 I ' ' ' 1 I ' ' 11 ' ' A3 B2 o - . o - -X ' ' ' - zh(mm) -' W 200 " 2h(mm) ' ' 200 - zh(mm) W ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' o 1000 xh(mm) O 1000 xh(mm) _200| ' ' 11 I 1 1 1 1 I 1 11 1 I 1 1 1 1 I 1 1 ' 1 I ' -200 1 1 1 1 1 I 1 1 1 1 I 1 ' ' ' I ' ' ' ' I ' ' ' ' I ' A4 P1 N * 200 - zh(mm) 200 - zh(mm) ł v LP STD Figure 32.

Summary of Head Acceleration Data from 1989 Tests Various experimental leg protection devices have been considered and devised to reduce or eliminate such negative side effects, but to date none have succeeded. Breakaway LP concepts have also been proposed, but it is not clear whether these would protect the legs, if they are designed to breakaway at sufficiently low forces to eliminate harmful effects such as torso pitch. METHODOLOGY HISTORY - Improving the evaluation methodology is one of the key areas in leg protection research. To usefully advance leg protection research, it is essential to understand the fundamental dynamic behavior and properties of riders in collisions. From this point of view, efforts to simulate three dimensional human motions and characteristics with mechanical test dummies is believed to be an area of major importance. To date, some progress has been made in simulating human leg characteristics with advanced dummy leg systems. Another goal has been the improvement of the overall biofidelity of three dimensional dummy motions and forces, including those of the head and upper body. For these reasons , the use of breakable leg bones and knee ligaments, and a cableless recording system have been considered, researched, developed, and applied in the industry's 1989 study. The resulting dummy system is believed to represent the state-of-the-art in the motorcycle rider protection research methodology. HUMAN FACTORS EVALUATION - As a result of a series of tests, the leg movement and "foot down" performance level with the TRRL UK Draft Specification (UKDS) LP was found by JAMA to be unacceptable for application to commercial motorcycle models. In general this is due to its restriction of leg movement caused by the leg and knee hitting and being caught by various parts of the LP. RECENT TEST RESULTS - The conclusion from 1989 LP crash tests conducted by the International Motorcycle Manufacturers Association (IMMA) is that in various kinds of realistic accident configurations, UKDS leg protectors : Reduce the number of leg injuries in only certain cases, Can lead to increased leg inj uries , Can lead to increased head injuries , Can increase overall injury severity . In all crash configurations tested, the head trajectory was lowered with LPs. In general, this is ascribed to the restraining action of the knee protection element (KPE) as the upper body moves forward, diagonally to the side, or laterally during impact. This torso and head pitch behavior appears to be fundamental with this concept of leg protection, and it is not clear how this could be reduced within this general concept . In addition, the KPE itself was seen to cause direct injury to the legs, due to: upper leg motions and forces occurring during and after impact; lower leg trap causing upper leg and knee bending failure; and downward leg deflection. For these reasons it is concluded that this general concept of leg protection does not contribute to improved rider protection. REFERENCES 1. Bothwell , P.W., R.E. Knight, H.C.

Otte : "Motorcycle Accident Impact Condition as a Basis for Motorcycle Crash Tests", 12th ESV International Conference (1989) APPENDIX A HUMAN FACTORS EVALUATIONS - In addition to full scale crash tests a series of human factors tests on UKDS leg protectors was conducted by JAMA. These were performed using a Kawasaki GPZ 500 motorcycle fitted with leg protectors designed and fabricated by TRRL. As noted elsewhere, UKDS leg protectors consist of three main functional parts: a primary impact element (PIE) , a rigid support element (RSE) , and knee protection element (KPE) , all of which must fit in the space between the rider's knees and the front of the vehicle structure (eg, the steering head tube). In most two wheeled vehicles, this distance is relatively short, which is related to the rider's need to reach the handlebars. This distance puts limits on the amount of knee and primary impact energy absorbing material that can be used, as well as leg protector geometry. The resulting geometry may compromise the rider's ability to move his legs, his comfort or his ability to control the vehicle in certain situations . In addition, the UKDS requires leg lateral retention, by means of a concave (90 mm deep) surface in front and to the outside of the knee and lower leg. In the past such a leg restraint concept was considered in JAMA research, and was rejected after consideration of the problems this posed for normal operation of the motorcycle by the rider, especially with regard to normal leg movement . Based on these factors , which led to a concern about rider leg movement behavior, a series of "foot down" tests were performed on the GPZ LP. The main focus of these tests was on foot down behavior during stopping because such a situation is considered to be representative of the general class of leg movement behaviors . A summary of the evaluations is presented below. Kinematic Considerations - Based on the UKDS, the position of the rider's knee joint center can be taken to coincide with the center of the concave section of the Knee Protection Element (KPE) . This means that the front half of the lower leg is surrounded by the KPE. In this circumstance, leg forward and lateral movement is obstructed, as shown in Figure A-l. Such restriction of 1056</page><page sequence="26">^nee hits inside °f ' Vv Vy&lt;^ KPE when rider wants ^ - to put out his leg Figure A-1. Leg Lateral Movement Restriction by Knee Protection Element (KPE) the knee lateral movement suggests difficulty in balancing the motorcycle with knee movement and also in extending the leg during a stop. Considering leg extension behavior in detail, when the rider needs to move his foot to the road surface, normally the foot moves from the foot rest to the ground target in a linear way, namely, toward the side of the foot rest and downward to the ground, and the lower leg follows the foot movement. With a KPE in place the lower leg has to exit the KPE as the foot exits the KPE, and has to move across the KPE vertical edge. As a result, the lower leg tends to hit the inside surface or edge of the KPE and leg extension behavior is impaired. Also, generally speaking, riders tend to extend their legs somewhat forward and to the side when they need to stop. This is because there is an expectation that, since the motorcycle is moving forward, the foot will be forced somewhat rearward when the foot touches the ground. Comparison of the actual knee trajectories with the KPE shape, as shown in Fig A- 2 clearly indicated that the KPE interferes with leg movement at the time of such "foot down" maneuvers. Shadowed area of KPE y ! interferes with leg y* j movement Figure A-2. Comparison of KPE Shape and Normal Leg Movement Area Stopping Tests - This test was conducted to observe leg movement during foot down maneuvers and to evaluate the ease of leg extension. Four test riders were used as subjects for the evaluation, with a standard motorcycle, and one fitted with LPs. From normal running, the rider applied the brakes to stop the motorcycle and put his foot down as the motorcycle stopped. This was performed with the rider only, and with the rider plus passenger. Front, side, and top view video recordings were made, and rider subjective ratings and comments were collected. The results indicated that the rider's leg movement was temporarily interrupted during foot down behavior as if the leg was being caught or obstructed by the leg protector. As a result the motorcycle appeared to lean more because of increased foot down time delay. However, no measures of such time delay or motorcycle leaning were made . Results of the 4 riders' subjective ratings are shown in Fig A- 3. This suggests problems in all leg movement categories . The expert test riders commented that, in their opinion, this LP device could not be applied to commercial models since the leg movement during leg retraction and extension was very difficult and the leg hit against many areas of the LP. The riders also commented that the freedom of leg movement was severely restricted: and that the foot could not be extended rapidly in emergency situations. It was likely, in their opinion, that this would result in motorcycle capsizes in some situations. The riders also commented that in particular, the knee was "caught" by the LP. This tendency was more noticeable with passenger and down grade roads and could also conceivably lead to dangerous situations. Static Simulation of Braking - To observe in further detail how the leg is caught on the LP, a static simulation of a stopping maneuver was conducted. In order to simulate deceleration by braking, the rear portion of the motorcycle was elevated and the leg extension behavior was observed. The results indicated that the leg could not be extended from inside the KPE without preparatory action on the part of the rider. This was related to the firm contact between the leg and knee with the inside wall and edge of the KPE. In order to smoothly extend the leg, the following preparatory action was observed to be needed: First, the rider must twist his hips to draw the knee out of the KPE, Next, the rider rotates the knee out of the KPE. Finally, the rider removes his foot from the foot rest and extends the leg downward. 1057</page><page sequence="27">5-1 Foot Down Ease 5-&gt; Foot Movement Ease 5-.

Rider Subjective Ratings from Leg Movement Evaluation Tests 1058</page><page sequence="28">When a rider needs to extend his leg very quickly (as in an emergency situation) , with standard motorcycles the foot is moved toward the ground target in a linear way, namely forward and downward. During this kind of action with the LP, the knee and lower leg were caught on the inside wall of the KPE by a friction force caused by the simulated braking force, plus inertial force of the lower leg related to the leg extension motion (this force becomes greater, when the leg movement is quicker) . As a result leg movement was restricted. In order to extend the leg further, the rider tended to wait until the inertia force disappears (namely until the lower leg stops) and then applied further force to overcome the friction force . The above indicates that the interference of the KPE with the desired trajectory of the knee and lower leg obstructs foot down behavior. Improvement of KPE Shape - Degraded foot down performance is considered to be a very serious issue with regard to the operation of two-wheeled vehicles. It is considered that a device with such degraded properties cannot be made practical unless the foot down performance is improved. Toward this end an initial study on improving the shape of the KPE was conducted. By installing a KPE made of styrofoam in place of the TRRL fabricated KPE, portions of the KPE which contacted the knee or lower leg during foot down behavior could be identified and cut away. This being accomplished, 4 test riders evaluated the modified KPE under static conditions to determine whether the knee or leg still contacted the KPE during foot down behavior. By iteratively repeating this process, a refined KPE was developed. As a result of this refinement the KPE shape no longer complied with the UK Draft Specification. Generally speaking, this suggests that the UKDS KPE shape is impractical with respect to foot down performance and is not applicable to actual vehicles . Stopping Tests Using Refined KPE - Although investigation up to this point had revealed that the UKDS for motorcycle leg protectors is impractical, it was determined that a further study would be pursued toward investigating human factors aspects of leg protection. The refined KPE was attached to the GPZ motorcycle and foot down performance was observed and evaluated, by performing braking test with rider plus passenger. The results showed that although the refined KPE gave satisfactory foot down performance under static conditions , during actual dynamic stopping situations various parts of the refined KPE were impacted by the leg. As a result the refined KPE was torn off its attachment brackets during the stopping tests. This situation indicated that, even if all of the KPE was removed, the knee would still impact the remaining portion of the LP, beyond the KPE. In particular, it was apparent that there was insufficient space remaining for the KPE due to space requirements for the RSE and PIE. Rider Forward Movement During Acceleration and Braking - The fact that the rider's knee hit the refined KPE suggested that the rider's knee must have translated forward during the braking maneuver. Therefore it was decided to measure such forward knee translation by using a video camera installed on the fuel tank of the motorcycle . The results showed that the rider's knee translated rearward when the motorcycle accelerated and forward when decelerating, a considerable distance (eg, approximately 30 mm) . Summary of Human Factors Evaluation - If an experimental LP concept is to include a lateral retaining element as part of a KPE, then the KPE 's rearmost edge should be positioned so as to prevent the knee hitting it during stopping maneuvers, including hard braking . In general, this suggests that not only the KPE but also the PIE and RSE position should be moved forward to prevent the knee and lower leg impacting and potentially causing injury during stopping maneuvers. However, there is only a limited amount of space on typical 2 wheelers between the rider's knees and the front of the vehicle structure (ie, the steering head tube). Overall, this suggests that basic human factors and practical considerations should be included, even at the conceptual stages of LP research. APPENDIX B INJURY COST ANALYSIS - This Appendix describes the method used for calculating injury costs based on crash test data. In general, this closely follows the formulation presented in (22) , with several modifications for the 1989 test program. These modifications included: Elimination of the chest injury criteria Elimination of the hip injury criteria Interpolation of step function cost curves using piecewise linear approach (trapezoidal rule) Elimination of hip and chest injuries from the injury cost analysis resulted from the inability to measure chest deflection using the existing MATD-1 test dummy, and the inability to monitor hip dislocations which resulted when the initial prototype 1059</page><page sequence="29">dislocatable hip design had to be replaced with a standard Hybrid III standing pelvis. In (22) , the functional relationships between maximum peak head acceleration and injury costs are of a stepwise, discrete form. This leads to discontinuities in injury costs at borderline conditions (eg, 50 g, 100 g, 150 g, etc.). Such discontinuities lead to over sensitivity to small variations, near borderline conditions (eg, injury cost for 201 g is much greater than for 199 g) ; and undersensitivity for other conditions (eg, injury cost for 199 g is the same as for 151 g) . These factors obviously affect the resolution and realism of the injury cost model . One way to address these problems is to apply linear interpolation for head injury cost assessment, as described herein. An example of the technique used to interpolate the various injury cost relationships is shown in Fig B-l. This shows the original step function relationship between head injury medical costs and head acceleration. Also shown is the interpolated relationship, which results from applying a trapezoidal rule to the step function plot. The piecewise linear relation represents a first order approximation to the original relationship; contains the same area under the curve; and eliminates large discontinuities in injury cost resulting from small changes in head acceleration, when the head acceleration values are near the steps in the curve. |S| ¡2 / 7 ¡2 / / CO / o / o / _l / 8 r/ s / z / 6 / -3 / Z / 0 2 1 o i , , , , . 0 HEAD ACCELERATION (g) 350 Figure B-1.

These leg injury costs are by nature discrete, and are summarized in Table B-l. Table B-2 contains risk of fatality factors based on the two most severe leg injuries. This factor was compared to that found in Fig B-4 and the maximum value was used in the final cost analysis. The injury cost for each crash test was calculated using the summary equation found in (22), which is given in Table B-3. This equation combines head and leg injuries and associated medical, disability and ancillary costs with the cost and probability of a fatality. An example injury cost calculation is given in Table B-4. Table B.l.
