<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MINIATURE CYCLE IN THE SANDOMIERZ PANTHEON AND THE MEDIEVAL ICONOGRAPHY OF ALEXANDER'S INDIAN CAMPAIGN By Krystyna Secomska 'Semper memor tui, etiam inter dubia bellorum nostrorum pericula, 3carissime praeceptor ac secundum matrem meam sororesque meas acceptissime, et quoniam te deditum philosophiae noveram, scribendum tibi de regionibus Indiae... existimavi, ut aliquid per novarum rerum cog- nitionem studio et ingenio possit accedere.... Mirandum est terra quantum aut bonarum rerum pariat aut malarum, conceptrix et parens publica ferarum... .'1 So begins the apocryphal Epistola Alexandri Magni ad Aristotelem magistrum suum de situ et mirabilibus Indiae-widely known in the Middle Ages.2 For all its rhetoric the Letter to Aristotle had for the medieval reader a value both documentary and emotional. It passed for an authentic record of the great conqueror's thoughts and feelings, a former pupil's address to his master with whom he wished to share his impressions and experiences. The person of Aristotle exerted an intellectual fascination even greater than that of Alexander himself. This alone could explain the general popularity of the Epistola in medieval Europe, but there were also other reasons. For the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, this fictitious description of unknown India became a storehouse of knowledge about the Far East, and its exotic flora, fauna and climate.3 Perhaps it also stimulated the imagination of those adventurers who in the thirteenth century followed the steps of ancient explorers. Contemporary mappaemundi often depicted Eastern monsters and strange human races and formed in a sense an illustrated Romance of Alexander.4 The belief in the real existence of these mirabilia was so deeply rooted in European culture that travellers such as Marco Polo, who traversed This article summarizes the final chapters of my doctoral dissertation, completed in 1971 in Warsaw University under the supervision of Professor Piotr Skubiszewski, to whom I am much indebted.

But it is also a result of the evolution from epic to romance at that time taking place in Western literature.' Alexander appears in the Epistola as the leader of a great army and as the pupil of Aristotle. But he is also depicted as a fighter of monsters and a knight seeking adventure. After his victory over King Porus he starts on a new and dangerous journey to the most distant parts of India, wishing to admire all things memorable in that strange country. He is led to the sanctuary of the Trees of the Sun and Moon, where he learns his future fate: 'Sed sequente anno mense nono Babilonia morieris: a quo minime speras, decipieris.'8 No fully illustrated manuscript of the Epistola Alexandri ad Aristotelem has come to light, though a few copies are decorated with some kind of frontispiece or a historiated letter.9 It exists, however, in illustrated form as a text inter- polated into the Pantheon of Godfrey of Viterbo, a writer at the court of Frederick Barbarossa. Five successive redactions of the Pantheon were made in Italy in the years I185-90, and in the last of them the author has inserted the text of the Epistola into the chapter on Alexander."o In addition to the Italian illuminated codices of the Pantheon, listed by 5 Wittkower, op. cit., pp. 195-6, and ibid., essential bibliography. 6 The text of the Epistola was used as a major source by Thomas of Kent in his Roman de Toute Chevalerie (second half of the I2th century), and by Lambert le Tort of Chateaudun in the poem known as Alexandre en Orient (third quarter of the I2th century). This poem was subsequently remodelled and expanded by Alexandre de Bernai to form Branch III of the Roman d'Alexandre. The Epistola was also used extensively in the second interpolated redaction (12) of the Historia de Preliis and in other medieval Alexander-texts. Cf. Ross, Alexander, pp. II, 25, 53, and notes for bibliography and editions of the texts. On the gradual penetration of Oriental and fantastic elements into the 2th-century Alexander-texts, see P. Meyer, Alexandre le Grand dans la litteraturefranfaise du Moyen Age, ii, Paris I886, pp. 369-72; E.

W. Southern's essay 'From Epic to Romance', The Making of the Middle Ages, London 1956, pp. 241-6. His remarks may be applied to the episodes of the Roman d'Alexandre inspired by the Epistola. The Epistola is not a conscious expression of the idea of the 'romantic quest', but it contains motifs which could be used in works exemplifying this concept of the hero of romance. 8 Boer, p. 48.

Ross,11 we can now furnish another: a Latin parchment manuscript written in the fourteenth century and now in the Chapter Library in Sandomierz in Poland.12 Its brief picture-cycle deals exclusively with the adventures of Alexander in farthest Asia. Twenty-seven of its twenty-eight miniatures illustrate the text of the Epistola while the last shows the Enclosing of Gog and Magog.13 The colophon gives the precise date of its completion: 'in crastino Sancti Jacobi Anno Domini 1335' and names the first owner: Hancho de Cosla, a canon of Cracow. A closer examination of the glosses and of the colophon shows that the manuscript was written in Poland.14 The fact of its having been executed at this time makes stylistic and formal appre- ciation of our modest set of miniatures extremely difficult. The very few monuments preserved do not allow us to reconstruct clearly the process of the assimilation of Gothic forms in Poland. The question is whether we have here an original creation, a copy, or a naive travesty of an earlier cycle? I wish here to discuss briefly the iconographic relations of the miniatures in the Sandomierz Pantheon to the tradition of medieval Alexander-iconography.15 In the Epistola, 'Alexander' describes his Indian campaign, his battle against King Porus, and the palace of the Indian ruler, decorated with the vine of gold and emeralds. He goes on to tell of the march of his troops through the waterless desert, the siege of a mysterious castle on an island and a night in camp by a lake, when the knights of Greece were attacked by venomous reptiles and terrifying beasts: huge white lions, wild boars, tigers, giant crabs, dragons and serpents of various kinds and the monstrous odontotyrannus. The illustrator of the Sandomierz manuscript begins his work at this point in the story, so that most of his miniatures represent the struggles of Alexander's knights with fantastic beasts. There are also a few episodes concerning encounters with Indians and wild men, and the account of the visit of Alexander to the sanctuary of the Trees of the Sun and Moon. The artist therefore made here a selection of certain themes and omitted a number of important events described both in the Epistola and in the biography of Alexander in the Pantheon. No other part of the manuscript is illustrated. What were the reasons for this selection? 11 Ross, Alexander, pp. 28-29, 58. 12 MS I I4; parchment; 190 folios (lacking 8 folios at the beginning, torn out); dimen- sions: 28-5 X 20 cm. It has been in the Chapter House of Sandomierz since at least the I8th century. Its previous history is unknown. The existence of this codex was noticed briefly by J. Rokoszny (Gottifredi Pantheon, Warsaw 1914) and mentioned in Katalog Zabytkdw Sztuki w Polsce (iii, 2, Warsaw 1962, p. 63). 13 The arrangement of the pictures was subordinated to the text. Miniatures appear on fols. 86-9o, inserted in the columns of the text and carried out in brown ink, coloured, and sometimes redrawn in ink, on the bare page, unframed. Dimensions: 4-5-6 cm x 3-5'5 cm. The predominant colours are vermilion, manganese green, pale yellow ochre, damson violet. The last miniature illustrates Godfrey's verse capitulum 'De Got et Magot quos Alexander similiter inter montes conclusit', which directly follows the interpolated text of the Epistola. 14A codicological and palaeographical description of the Sandomierz Pantheon is shortly to be published-cf. n. 8 above. The first owner of the manuscript was probably Hancho de Cosla. 15 I base myself on the classification of Ross, Alexander.</page><page sequence="4">56 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA The role of Alexander in Godfrey of Viterbo's treatise is by no means a secondary one. His deeds are interwoven with Godfrey's account of the Emperor of the Last Days, the last cosmocrator, who is prophetically fore- shadowed as a descendant of the Hohenstaufen and as the final conqueror of Gog and Magog.16 Nevertheless we cannot regard Alexander as the central personage of the Pantheon."7 The penetration of fantastic and quasi-scientific themes into the medieval legend of Alexander, and the general popularity of the Epistola may explain the peculiar interest of the patron who com- missioned the manuscript in this part of Alexander's life. But such an explanation does not make the origin of the picture-cycle wholly clear, nor can it account for the selection of themes in the text of the Epistola. It is there- fore necessary to try to establish the iconographic models which the illustrator of our Sandomierz Pantheon may have taken as patterns. Twenty-eight manuscripts of Godfrey's text are extant.18 None contains a complete illustrative cycle. Such a cycle was intended for the Pantheon written in 1331 in Milan for Azzo Visconti (Paris, Bibliothbque Nationale, MS lat. 4895), but its painter executed only a part of the projected decoration, the miniatures for the chapters based on the Old Testament."1 Of the other copies of the Pantheon two are illuminated: an Italian manuscript of the thirteenth century, (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, MS lat. 5003),20 which I shall call the Paris Pantheon, and another Italian text of the fourteenth century, now in Viterbo, Biblioteca Capitolare21 (Viterbo Pantheon). In the Marciana Pantheon, an Italian manuscript of the fourteenth century (Venice, Biblioteca 16 This theme was developed by Godfrey in the two capitula 'De omnibus Sibillis' (cf. Waitz, op. cit., pp. 145-7) and 'De Got et Magot'. See also E. Sackur, Sibyllinische Texte und Forschungen, Halle 1898, p. 132. 17 Though Godfrey described Alexander's exploits in a separate chapter of his treatise, the main personages of the historical section of the Pantheon are beyond doubt Constantine, Charlemagne and above all the German emperors, shown as forerunners of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The interpretation of Alexander in the Pantheon has been studied by L. Meyer (op. cit., pp. 55-114) and G. Cary (op. cit., pp. 93-94, 125, I8o, 188, 263 note 3). They stress the element of literary delectatio in the presentation, and the problem of his moral and religious condemnation (suggested by the Collatio cum Dindimo). The attitude of Godfrey towards Alexander is inconsistent and equivocal. Nevertheless, it may be useful to show the connexions of the legendary Alexander with one of the leading ideas of the treatise-the Emperor of the Last Days. (A full discussion of this will appear shortly. Above, n. 8.) 18sWaitz mentions twenty-seven manu- scripts of the Pantheon (op. cit., pp. 13-20)- including a copy from Fulda, now lost but known from the edition of Pistorius (Frank- furt 1584). To these extant twenty-six manu- scripts two others should be added which are not cited by Waitz: the Sandomierz Pantheon and that in Viterbo, Biblioteca Capitolare (cf. M. Mantovani, 'Goffredo da Viterbo e il Pantheon della Biblioteca capitolare', in Miscellanea di studi viterbesi, Viterbo 1962, P. 337). 19 The last miniatures are painted on fol. 56v, after which there are only spaces left for illustrations. See P. Toesca, La pittura e la miniatura nella Lombardia, Milan 1912, p. 201; Ross, Alexander, p. 29; C. Samaran and R. Marichal, Catalogue des manuscripts en &amp;criture latine portant des indications de date, de lieu et de copiste, Bibliotheque nationale, ii, Paris 1962, P. 243. 20 Cf. Ross, Alexander, pp. 28, 58. The manuscript comes from the collection of the Duc de Noailles (Anne-Jules?); not later than 1744 it was transferred to the Biblio- theque royale (cf. Catalogus Codicum MSS. Bibliothecae Regiae, iii/iv, Paris 1744, P. 29). 21 Mantovani, op. cit., p. 337. Presented in the early I6th century to Cristoforo Spiriti, Bishop of Cesena, by Giovanni Vitale.

In the Sandomierz codex, this cycle includes twenty-seven scenes (the twenty- eighth shows the Enclosing of Gog and Magog) while in the Paris and Viterbo manuscripts it consists of twenty-eight miniatures and a twenty-ninth repre- senting the scribe at work. In the Marciana Pantheon the decoration planned for the text of the Epistola was conceived in twenty-five scenes with a twenty- sixth undoubtedly intended for Gog and Magog.23 Thus an established iconography for the Pantheon can be traced back in Italy to the thirteenth century. The miniaturists illustrated almost exclusively the section of the text devoted to the Indian campaign of Alexander. We must, however, note certain variations. In the Paris Pantheon, at the beginning of Particula I, there is an initial showing God the Creator, and at the beginning of Particula XVII a miniature of Alexander enthroned. In the Viterbo Pantheon the initial on the first page is historiated with a scene of the offering of the book to the pope. In spite of these differences we may in effect speak of an established pictorial cycle for the Epistola in Italian manuscripts of the Pantheon. This Italian iconographic tradition is transmitted to the Sandomierz Pantheon. In all four of these manuscripts we have a nearly identical selection of themes illustrated, with considerable portions of the narrative left un- illustrated, for example the war with Porus and the capture of the royal residence in Prasiaca. Was it because the events described at the beginning of the Epistola were not attractive subjects for the painters? It is more probable that the reasons were different, since the episodes missing in these four manu- scripts are illustrated in other thirteenth-century Alexander-texts, for example in the Leipzig Historia de Preliis.24 In any case, in the Paris and the Viterbo, as well as in the Sandomierz Pantheons, the first miniature depicts the siege of the castle on an island, and the second the moment when the Macedonian troops swimming across the river, are attacked by hippopotami. The first blank space of the Marciana codex was intended to contain a picture of the latter episode. Furthermore, the illustrations in all these manuscripts are in most cases placed at the same point in the accompanying text. In the case 22 Ross, Alexander, pp. 29, 58. 23 The last miniature in the Venice cycle was to be placed under the title of the capitulum on Gog and Magog. The estab- lishment of the subject of the last miniature in the Paris Pantheon (cf. P1. 8k) presents some problems. A man makes a gesture to the scribe working at his desk. This man, who is bare-headed, cannot be identified with Alexander himself. He may be the author. Or the miniature may be an allusion to the everlasting glory of Alexander, placed as it is directly under the sentence 'ut immortalitas esset perpetua et nobis opinio et animi industriae, optime Aristoteles, iudicium'. 24 In the manuscripts subsequently dis- cussed of the Historia de Preliis (Leipzig, Universitaitsbibl., Repositorium II, 143) and of the Roman de toute Chevalerie (Paris, B. Nat. frangais 24364) the scenes inspired by the early part of the text of the Epistola are illus- trated: e.g. the battle with Porus (Leipzig, fol. 59V), Alexander visiting the royal palace and gardens (ibid., fol. 6ov), the march through the desert-Zefirus brings water to the king (Leipzig, fol. 63; Paris, fol. 52), the encounter with the two old men (Paris, fol. 70). For the text see Boer, pp. 3-4, 4-6, 8-9, 38-40. 5</page><page sequence="11">58 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA of the Oracle of the Miraculous Trees, the placing of the illustration could not be a matter of chance.25 In the Sandomierz Pantheon we several times find the same iconographic formulas as in the Paris codex, with changes in details. In scene 6 of the Sandomierz cycle we see, as in the Paris Pantheon, two large beasts of prey and a smaller one (P1. 5a; cf. P1. 5e) although the text of the Epistola at this point mentions a variety of beasts lurking in the Indian forests, a text that seemingly left the illustrator complete liberty in selecting his motifs.26 In scene 13 (P1. 6b) the basic layout of the fight with wild boars is likewise retained (cf. Pl. 6g), as in scene 15 (Pl. 7a) an original picture of a group of giant bats. Here the difficulty of fitting this circular composition into the space available is felt in both manuscripts (P1. 6g). In scene 14 of the Sando- mierz manuscript (P1. 6c), which apparently differs from the corresponding picture in the Paris book (P1. 6g), we find the survival of an iconographic tradition. Various rapacious animals described in the adjacent text. '.. . apri mixti maculosis lyncibus tigridibusque et horribilibus pantheris' are replaced by a dragon not mentioned in the narrative.27 In spite of these resemblances the Sandomierz manuscript is not a direct copy of any Italian Pantheon known to me. It is not likely that the Marciana Pantheon was copied directly from the Paris version. To say nothing of icono- graphic and textual differences, a special system of illustration was used in both the Sandomierz and the Marciana manuscripts. The pictures are inserted in the column of the text, but occupy only half or two-thirds of its breadth."2 The problem of the filiation of the Paris and the Viterbo codices demands a separate study; most probably both reproduce a common proto- type. It seems possible that the painter of Viterbo imitated the miniatures of 25 The account of the visit of Alexander to the sanctuary (Boer, op. cit., pp. 43-52) in the Paris Pantheon occupies almost four columns of the text, and in the Sandomierz more than three columns. The picture of the king before the Miraculous Trees is placed in both (and also in the Viterbo MS) close to the beginning of the narrative: '. .. arbores, quas brebionas Indi apellant' (Boer, p. 44 line i). If we can assume that the miniature in the Paris Pantheon (cf. P1. 8f) shows the king's arrival at the holy grove, in accordance with the adjacent passage of the text, the Sandomierz miniature (cf. P1. 8e) certainly represents the very moment of the prophecy, or that of the Alexander's prayer before the Tree of Moon. It seems, therefore, that it was placed ten to fourteen lines too early, before the corre- sponding passage in the narrative. 26 Cf. Boer, pp. 14-15. 27 Cf. Boer, p. 20. In the Paris Pantheon the artist represented in this scene an enor- mous beast of prey resembling a lion (and probably intended for a tiger), a smaller spotted one (a cheetah or panther?) and a dragon. In the Sandomierz Pantheon there is a panther with two dragons. Perhaps the creator of the first illustrative cycle in intro- ducing the motif of the dragon was prompted by purely decorative reasons; and his imitators copied him mechanically. A similar repre- sentation of the panther appears in the famous 9th-century Physiologus of Bern (Bern, Stadtbibliothek, cod. 318, fol. 15), repr. in H. Woodruff, 'The Physiologus of Bern', Art Bulletin, xii, 1930, fig. 26. See also O. Homburger, Die illustrierten HSS. des Burger- bibliothek Bern der Vorkarolingischen und Karo- lingischen Zeit, Bern 1962, pp. 101-17. 28 Such a system of illustration occurs in rolls in Antiquity (cf. K. Weitzmann, Illus- tration in Roll and Codex, Princeton 1947, P. 71). In the late Middle Ages it was applied rather rarely, but most frequently in Italian manu- scripts. The iconographic differences between the Paris and Sandomierz cycles will be dis- cussed below; here attention is drawn only to the slightly different selection of themes illustrated. On the other hand, the selection of the scenes intended to be illustrated in the Marciana Pantheon is almost identical with the set of episodes represented in Sandomierz.</page><page sequence="12">ALEXANDER'S INDIAN CAMPAIGN 59 Paris, yet the presentation miniature with the Pope and Godfrey was perhaps copied from another manuscript, although, as the presentation picture is a standard iconographic formula, the use of a model was not absolutely neces- sary.29 The oldest surviving member of this group, the Paris manuscript, is presumably the work of a provincial south Italian painter of the second half of the thirteenth century. 3 Certain elements of its composition furnish evidence that this cycle of miniatures was copied from another manuscript31 and it cannot be excluded that the actual archetype of the picture-cycle of the Epistola was accessible to the Paris illustrator. Beyond doubt, this archetype was either executed in Italy or, if it originated in another country, was imported into Italy to create there, and only there, a lasting iconographic tradition. When and how was this iconographic cycle created? And was its genesis associated with a manuscript of the Pantheon itself or with an independent copy of the Epistola? A comparison of the miniatures of the Paris codex with the corresponding text permits the conjecture that the iconographic formulas illustrating certain scenes directly reflect the text as it appears in the Pantheon. In the miniature representing the encounter with the bicephalous monster (P1. 7m) we see a two-headed dragon whose first head is of a strange shape, resembling a crescent. 'Caput . . leaenae simile' writes the author of the vulgate version of the Epistola. In the Paris Pantheon this passage was erroneously transcribed 'caput . . lune simile'.32 This mistake occurs only in manuscripts of the Pantheon and the artist of the original cycle of the Epistola in the Pantheon certainly followed this variant of the text. The Paris and Viterbo miniatures represent the first version of the cycle, while those of Sandomierz belong to a later phase. Numerous as their 29 The cycle of miniatures in the Viterbo Pantheon seems to be carefully, if not very skil- fully, copied from the Paris cycle, with changes in the iconographic type of Alexan- der and certain animal motifs. The selection of themes for illustration is identical in both manuscripts. The presentation scene shown on fol. I in the Viterbo MS (cf. Mantovani, op. cit., p. 337, fig. I) requires further examination. The Viterbo codex awaits codicological and philological study. 30 The Paris cycle is not of great artistic or technical quality; it was probably executed in a provincial workship. Some resemblances in the treatment of figures and in the physio- gnomic type may be found in the illustrations to De diversis herbis in a 13th-century manu- script presumably illuminated in Sicily (Florence, Laur., MS Plut. 73, i6; cf. Cata- logo ... della Miniatura, Pal. Venezia, Rome/ Florence 1954, no. 00oo; Formaggio/Basso, La Mliniatura, Novara 1960, pl. 8). The drawing of the faces and the method of shading seem to imitate Sicilian technique: cf. De Balneis Puteolanis of c. 1264 (Rome, Biblioteca Angelica, MS 1474-see A. Daneu-Lattanzi, Lineamenti di storia della miniatura in Sicilia, Florence 1965, PP- 55-58, and C. M. Kauff- mann, The Baths of Pozzuoli. A Study of the mediaeval Illuminations of Peter of Eboli's Poem Oxford I959). The reptiles in the Paris Pantheon may be compared with the dragons in the so-called Manfred Bible of c. 1258 (Biblioteca Vaticana, MS Vat. lat. 36-cf. Daneu-Lattanzi, op. cit., pp. 53-54, fig. 43). It seems then that the author of the minia- tures in the Paris Pantheon was active in southern Italy in the second half of the I3th century and had contacts with Sicily. 31 The painter sometimes found it hard to fit his figure group into the space left him by the scribe. This is not necessarily due to lack of skill. In the fights with serpents and dra- gons (P1. 5b, c) the monsters are so crowded that the drawing becomes practically un- readable. In the fight with the bats (P1. 6g), the artist has added a fourth bat outside the frame of the composition. This was not for any iconographic or compositional reason; the painter was obviously attempting to repeat the formula of an archetype. 32 Cf. Boer, p. 29. The passage appears on fol. 94V of the Paris Pantheon and on fol. 88 of the Sandomierz.</page><page sequence="13">60 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA similarities are, they should not be allowed to obscure differences which are too important to be understood only as a result of stylistic developments. To explain them and to reconstruct the history of the pictorial cycle of the Epistola we must look to illuminated manuscripts of other medieval Alexander- texts, such as the Historia de Preliis, the Roman d'Alexandre and the Roman de toute Chevalerie. We find in these also the sequence of scenes illustrating the Indian campaign, since the authors of these Alexander-books here used the Epistola as their source. Let us now examine the most significant and copiously illustrated manuscripts of these texts. i. Historia de Preliis 12, Leipzig, Universitatsbibl., MS Repositorium II 143, a south Italian manuscript of the late thirteenth century, with one hundred and sixty-seven miniatures. As Ross has pointed out,33 the scenes are mostly based upon the Late Antique Cycle, which seems to have reached southern Italy via a Ps.-Callisthenes manuscript imported from Byzantium, probably in the first half of the thirteenth century. The sequence of illustrations of the Indian exploits of Alexander has never been studied exhaustively, so that it is difficult to establish precisely which elements follow the antique tradition and which of them are an invention of the medieval artist.34 2. Historia de Preliis I1 (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, MS lat. 8501), a south Italian manuscript of the early fourteenth century with a cycle of ninety pen-drawings. The immediate source of these pictures was a manu- script of the Old French Prose Alexander illustrated with a shortened cycle of pictures taken over from the Late Antique Cycle.35 3. Roman d'Alexandre (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodl. 264) illu- minated probably in Bruges in the years 1338-44. This manuscript has one hundred and ten miniatures illustrating the text of the Roman d'Alexandre, together with historiated initials and very numerous marginal dr6leries. In spite of the comparatively late date of execution of this set of miniatures the influence of the original cycle of the Roman d'Alexandre cannot be excluded.36 4. Roman de toute Chevalerie (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS 0.9-34) executed in the style of the St. Albans school about 1250; illustrated with one hundred and fifty-two coloured pen-drawings; about half of its folios are lost.37 5. Roman de toute Chevalerie (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, MS fr. 24364), an English manuscript of about i3oo with three hundred and eleven minia- tures and pen-drawings. As Ross has pointed out, the iconography of all the 33 D. J. A. Ross, 'Olympias and the Ser- pent.

We can assume that the miniatures of both manuscripts of Roman de toute Chevalerie reproduce a lost English archetype dating back, in Ross's opinion, to the second quarter of the thirteenth century.38 The manuscripts of the Roman de toute Chevalerie supply us with the fullest set of representations of the monsters and marvels of the East. This cycle awaits thorough study.39 It would be impossible to discuss here in detail all scenes of Alexander's Indian campaign in these manuscripts. Some particular problems are briefly touched on in the footnotes, but only the most important conclusions are stated in the text. Even a cursory juxtaposition of the text of the Sandomierz manuscript with its pictorial decoration reveals the dependence of the miniatures on an earlier cycle of another manuscript, a lost copy of the Pantheon with the illus- trated Epistola section.40 There is reason to believe that this model-I shall call it Pantheon 'A'-had the same system of illustration as the Sandomierz codex, with an identical set of subjects and similar iconography. It was probably a work of higher artistic quality. Was this MS 'A' imported from Italy? I would rather suggest that it was made in an eastern region of central Europe, in Poland or Bohemia, or perhaps in Austria, in the early fourteenth century. Nevertheless, its picture-cycle was based mainly on an Italian prototype. In the Sandomierz Pantheon in spite of its rather mediocre technical quality, we can find elements of the pure Gothic linear style-the style that prevailed about 1320 in Upper Austria. These elements presumably derived from its immediate source, Pantheon 'A'. It was perhaps the painter of this MS 'A' who made the stylistic transposition from Italian to northern Gothic.41 What of the Italian Pantheon which served as a model for the artist of MS 'A'? It was evidently neither our Paris manuscript, nor any other manuscript of the same type. The first illustrative cycle of the Epistola in the Pantheon-it may be called Cycle IE I-which is reflected in both the Paris and the Viterbo codices, underwent essential changes, most probably in the 38 P. Meyer, op. cit., ii, pp. 277-80; Ross, Alexander, pp. 25-26. The manuscript for- merly belonged to the Bishop of Blois, M. de Caumartin; it was sold in 1734 in Paris and subsequently entered the Bibliotheque royale. 39 Ross, Alexander, p. 79, has pointed out that there is no trace here of the influence of the antique Solinus tradition. 40 Apart from its relation to Italian cycles, several compositional elements of the Sando- mierz miniatures support this. The contours of animals sometimes cover those of men (cf. P1. 6b). The basic proof is the disagree- ment of several pictures with the text-e.g. the inverted sequence of two phases of the fight with the three-horned odontotyrannus, the creature's attack following instead of preceding its defeat (P1. 7a). Similar examples of mistakes resulting from the careless copying of an earlier illustrative cycle are discussed by Weitzmann (op. cit., p. 161). 41 We can assume that the Sandomierz illustrator, who was without great technical experience, would not be able to make such a transposition. Some formulas in the Sando- mierz cycle may point to a loose connexion with the art of Upper Austria (cf. e.g. Biblia Pauperum, c. 1325-30, in Budapest. See G. Schmidt, Die Armenbibeln des XIV Jh., Graz- Cologne 1959, pp. 13-I4, pls. 7-14 and 16). These conjectures, of course, do not solve the problem of the provenance of MS 'A', the hypothetical model of the Sandomierz Pan- theon. Nevertheless, the miniature cycle in MS 'A' was certainly based on that in an Italian manuscript. We find no trace of the mass production of illuminated manuscripts of the Pantheon in any country other than Italy.</page><page sequence="15">62 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA thirteenth century and on Italian soil. The evidence for this is the icono- graphic analogies of the later cycle of the Epistola, the model of the miniatures in the Sandomierz Pantheon, with the illustrations of the Alexander-legend in the south Italian Historia de Preliis of Leipzig. The painter of the Paris Pantheon was not acquainted with the extensive picture-cycle of the Historia de Preliis, which became popular in Italy in the second half of the thirteenth century.42 Instead, two Italian models were accessible to the creator of the new pictorial cycle of the Epistola-let us call it IE 2-namely an illustrated Pantheon in version IE I and an illuminated Historia de Preliis in a version close to the Leipzig manuscript. As may be inferred from the analysis of the Sandomierz miniatures, the selection of the themes illustrated as well as the placing of the scenes in the text in the Cycle IE 2 follows that of IE I. Even the tradition of representing some episodes in their successive stages persists, e.g. the narrative of the fight with the odontotyrannus (Pls. 6g, 7a). At the same time, however, some important-though seemingly small-modifications were made in the choice of subject. First, a scene was added which in the Sandomierz manuscript opens the cycle. It represents the arrival of Alexander in the vicinity of the castle (P1. 4a). The King is present in this episode in the Leipzig Historia de Preliis also (P1. 4c). Secondly, the scene of the Enclosing of Gog and Magog was added to close the cycle.43 In the initial scenes of the cycle the conception of the hero is slightly changed. In the Paris Pantheon Alexander is represented as an enthroned emperor giving orders to his knights, both in camp and on the march, and even during the fight with the lions (Pls. 4b, 6g).44 The use of this hieratic ruler- formula gives an archaic touch to Cycle IE I. In the Sandomierz Pantheon at the siege of the castle (P1. 4a) and in camp (P1. 5a) Alexander is an armed horseman leading a group of knights, as in the Leipzig Historia. In the miniatures which follow-the fights with the animals-innovations were introduced from an iconographic redaction close to that of the Leipzig Historia. In the battle with two-headed serpents (P1. 5a), the snakes have crests, in accord with the Epistola's 'serpentes cristati'. These come from the picture- cycle of the Historia de Preliis-cf. the Leipzig MS (P1. 5f). In the next scene 42 The lack of analogies between the minia- tures of the Paris Pantheon and those of the Leipzig Historia was observed by Ross (Alexander, pp. 28-29). The similar arrange- ment of the swimming men and beasts in the scene of the attack of the hippopotami may deserve further investigation (cf. P1. 4c, e), but the resemblance may also be fortuitous, or it may be connected with the use of a common prototype-perhaps some repre- sentation of the Flood. 43 The addition of the last illustration, the Enclosing of Gog and Magog, in the Mar- ciana and the Sandomierz Pantheon, was probably due to the topicality of the subject in the 13th century. The selection of themes is almost identical in both manuscripts, as may be inferred from the disposition of the spaces in the Marciana Pantheon, though two scenes at the beginning of the cycle are omitted: the arrival of Alexander and the archers shooting at the castle. Perhaps the artist intended to represent three phases of the siege of the castle (with the attack of the hippopotami) in the same miniature, as in the Leipzig Historia (cf. P1. 4c). 44 For example the painter of the Paris Pantheon represented Alexander enthroned in the scene of the encounter with the Indians in the boat (P1. 4b)-at the very point in the story when the Macedonian army had to raise the siege and was wandering along the bank of the bitter river looking for fresh water (cf. Boer, p. 14).</page><page sequence="16">ALEXANDER'S INDIAN CAMPAIGN 63 giant crabs are shown, as in the Leipzig and Paris MSS of the Historia. In the Paris and Viterbo Pantheons the snakes and dragons appear repeatedly in four successive episodes (P1. 5b, c), while in the adjacent text the Macedonians suffer from the attacks of scorpions, multi-coloured snakes, 'serpentes cristati duo capita habentes' and finally giant crabs.45 The destruction of the three-horned odontotyrannus46 is treated by the Sandomierz artist (P1. 7a) differently from that of the Paris codex (P1. 6g). The beast is still not overthrown although the spears piercing its body make it bleed copiously. The subject is interpreted in the same way in the Leipzig Historia (P1. 7h). The scene of the battle with the elephants occurs in several illuminated Alexander-manuscripts. Only in the Sandomierz Pantheon (P1. 7k) and the Leipzig Historia (P1. 8a) are we shown, in this episode, soldiers holding pigs.47 It must be stressed that this group is in both manuscripts designed following a common formula. Finally, the motif of the serpents with coloured protuberances on their heads- 'serpentes... habentes in collo lapides qui smaragdi appellantur'-appears only in the Sandomierz Pantheon (P1. 71) and the Leipzig Historia (P1. 8c).48 Some coincidences of lesser importance, such as the iconographic formula used for the fight with the lions (P1. 6a), the way of representing the nocturnal birds (P1. 7f)49 and the scene in the sacred grove (P1. 8e) are here omitted.50 45Boer, pp. 16-I 9. The scorpions and crabs in Cycle IE 2 may possibly be based on bestiary illustrations (cf. C. Singer, 'The Herbal in Antiquity', Journal of Hellenic Studies, xlvii, 1922, repr. p. 36; and K. Weitz- mann, Ancient Book Illumination, Cambridge, Mass. 1959, fig. 17), or on those of zodiacal cycles. On the other hand, the closest analogies for serpents with multicoloured stripes, 'immensa vis... serpentium variis distincta coloribus', as well as for serpents with triple crests (P1. 5a) are found in the Leipzig Historia. There, all these episodes appear in the same miniature (P1. 5f). In the Paris Historia de Preliis (cf. n. 35 above) they are the subjects of separate scenes. 46 I mean here miniature 16 of the cycle-- i.e. the second in the column reproduced above. In the Sandomierz MS the sequence of these two episodes was erroneously inverted (n. 40 above). 47 At the decisive moment of the battle Alexander orders his soldiers to make the pigs squeal and the voices of these 'impure' animals terrify the elephants (Boer, p. 30). In other cycles of Alexander illustrations the pigs do not appear. (The battle of the Macedonians with the elephants is shown in the Bodleian Roman d'Alexandre, fol. 62). 48 In the Paris Pantheon the serpents have round their necks almost invisible necklaces with a small white stone pendant (P1. 8b). In the Leipzig Historia they have blue pro- tuberances at the backs of their heads, which agrees with their description in the Historia de Preliis as having emeralds 'in caput'. In form, size and position the emeralds in the Sandomierz Pantheon are almost identical with those in the Leipzig Historia. 49 In the scene of the fight with the lions the artist of IE 2 abandoned the basic icono- graphic formula of IE I, with Alexander enthroned and a soldier blowing a horn (P1. 6g) in favour of a violent clash of men and beasts as in the Leipzig Historia (P1. 6d). The group of three lions in the Sandomierz picture seems to have originated in a combination of two iconographic formulas: the original scheme of IE I and the more dynamic formula of the Leipzig Historia, with the ram- pant lion touching with his paw the shield of Alexander. In scene 19 of the Sandomierz cycle there are nocturnal birds resembling vultures or eagles, fishing in the lake (Boer, pp. 21-22: 'nycticoraces aves vulturibus similes'). In the Leipzig Historia also these birds are plunging into the lake (P1. 7i). On the other hand, the birds in the correspond- ing miniature in the Paris Pantheon resemble owls (P1. 7c). The word 'nycticorax' has been variously interpreted as an owl (J. Bal- truvaitis, Le Moyen Age fantastique. Antiquite's et exotismes dans l'art gothique, Paris I955, p. 155) or as a nocturnal raven (T. H. White, The Bestiary. A Book of beasts, being a trans- lation from a Latin Bestiary, London-New York 1960, pp. 133-4). 50 This scene demands separate iconographic</page><page sequence="17">64 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA From this material it would appear that Cycle IE 2 was formed in Italy under strong influence of an illuminated manuscript of the Historia de Preliis. There are, however, other possibilities to be considered. In the first place, could the influence have run in the opposite direction, and the creation of the new illustrative cycle for the Epistola in the Pantheon have influenced the miniatures of the Leipzig Historia? Everything that we know about the origin and importance of the picture-cycle of the Historia de Preliis seems opposed to such a hypothesis. This cycle, a derivative of the Late Antique Cycle of Ps.-Callisthenes, was introduced into Italy not later than the middle of the thirteenth century. It was copied and adapted in several versions in manu- scripts of the Historia and the Old French Prose Alexander between the thirteenth and the fifteenth century.51 On the other hand, the Sandomierz Pantheon is the only material proof of the existence of Cycle IE 2, whose influence, therefore, must have been rather restricted. It would appear that all that is new in the depicting of Alexander's Indian adventures was due to the artist of the Historia pictorial cycle, who had thoroughly studied his literary source and who revealed his creative ability in a great number of scenes. It would not be reasonable to ascribe these qualities to one of the illustrators of the Pantheon-the unknown artist of Cycle IE 2. Certainly, he was independent enough to introduce some innovations, but in general he conformed to the iconography of the previous cycle, IE I. Secondly, could Cycle IE 2 have been elaborated outside Italy, perhaps in a French or German workshop, where artists might have followed a manu- script of the Pantheon illustrated with version IE I and an illustrated Historia de Preliis? This hypothesis seems unlikely since no evidence of the diffusion in northern Europe of illuminated manuscripts of the Pantheon survives, with the sole exception of the Sandomierz Pantheon, and all existing illustrated manuscripts of the Historia executed before 1400 are undoubtedly the work ofItalian masters.52 analysis. It appears, however, that the image of the Miraculous Trees in the Paris Pantheon (P1. 8f) descends from the Oriental type of the 'Wakwak' tree with anthropomorphic fruits (Baltruvaitis, op. cit., pp. 117-31; and especially fig. 55). In Christian iconographic tradition the 'Wak- wak' was identified with the Tree of Life-as in a miniature in the Saxon Psalter of c. 1250 in Wolfenbiittel (Herzog-August Bibliothek, Cod. Guelf. 521 Helmst., fol. 9; cf. Bal- trulaitis, op. cit., fig. 57b). In other manu- scripts of the Alexander-legend the Trees of the Sun and the Moon are almost always identified by Sun- and moon-discs (P1. 8g). These symbols are lacking in the illustrations to the Roman de toute Chevalerie (P1. 8h, i) where the adventures of the king at the oracle became the subject of a long series of scenes. The miniature in the Sandomierz Pantheon presumably represents the moment of the prophecy of the Tree of the Moon (n. 25 above). Alexander is turning to the Tree of the Moon with a gesture of prayer (P1. 8e). In the Leipzig Historia also (P1. 8g) he raises his hands as if in prayer. The artist of Cycle IE 2 seems to have returned to the formula of IEI (the placing of the scene and the trees, four in number), but was also influenced by the more recent iconographic tradition (the astral symbols, the presence of the witnesses and Alexander's gesture). 51 Ross, Alexander, pp. 51-57, 61. 52 Ross, Alexander, pp. 51-54, 61. We can- not of course wholly exclude the possible former existence of illuminated manuscripts of the Pantheon in northern Europe. In the existing state of knowledge, the view that the evolution of both these picture-cycles and their synthesis in Cycle IE 2 were completed in Italy not later than about 1300 seems more logical. The selection of subjects in the Mar- ciana Pantheon (n. 43 above) gives evidence of the transformations that took place in the Italian tradition of the illustration of the Epistola in the Pantheon.</page><page sequence="18">ALEXANDER'S INDIAN CAMPAIGN 65 The view of the iconographic origin of the Sandomierz cycle here suggested, can be expressed in the following diagram: CYCLE IE I Earliest Italian manuscripts of the Pantheon with the Epistola illustrated EXAMPLE: PARIS Pantheon ILLUSTRATIVE CYCLE OF THE HISTORIA DE PRELIIS Italian illuminated manuscripts of the Hisloria EXAMPLE: LEIPZIG Historia CYCLE IE 2 Italian manuscripts of the Pantheon with the Epistola illustrated following a new iconographic redaction TIHE LOST Pantheon A SANDOMIERZ Pantheon Fig. i. Diagram expressing the iconographic origin of the Sandomierz cycle. Apart from all probable borrowings from the miniatures of the Historia de Preliis the artist of Cycle IE 2 made corrections, based upon a careful reading of the text. For example, in the background of the first miniature (P1. 4a), he depicted the enormous canes described in the Epistola. He also rejected the slightly grotesque motif of the crescent-shaped dragon's head (P1. 7m) and instead crowned his two-headed monster with a lunar symbol (P1. 7j).53 These remarks do not exhaust the problem of the pictorial decoration in 53 The version of the text describing the dragon's head as 'lune simile' also reached the Sandomierz Pantheon (n. 32 above). Tall, leafless trees in the landscape background of miniatures I and 7 in the Sandomierz MS (Pls. 4a, 5a) are to be identified as Indian reeds. In the Epistola the Macedonians march along the river-side surrounded by thickets of gigantic reeds (Boer, p. 9). The same reeds grow round the lake by which Alexander established his camp (Boer, p. I8; Sando- mierz MS, fol. 86v). This motif derives from the text of the Epistola rather than from the picture-cycle of Historia de Preliis. In the background of the scenes at the lake the Leipzig Historia has a lush, leafy forest (Pl. 5f).</page><page sequence="19">66 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA the Sandomierz codex. The abundance and diversity of its animal motifs deserve separate study, with special attention to the species seemingly deriving from English or French bestiaries of the thirteenth century. Further analogies should be sought in the eastern parts of northern Europe.54 It seems certain that the illustrator of MS 'A', the supposed model of the Sandomierz Pantheon, played a prominent part in the final evolution of this cycle of pictures for the Epistola. Nevertheless, despite the modest technical and artistic quality of the Sandomierz miniature cycle, we should be reluctant to consider its master as a mere clumsy copyist. His vivid feeling for the narrative elements and his special skill in depicting the various beasts allow us to credit him with some inventiveness. He was not an artist of great merit. Presumably he spent his earlier life painting large-scale compositions, such as murals, designs for tapestries or, at least, full-page miniatures. But he lacked sufficient practice in adapting complicated compositions and profusion of detail to the exigencies of small surfaces (approximately 3 x 4'5 cm.) without losing the linear subtlety of his model. Is, then, the Sandomierz codex an example of amateurish art? It must be noted in any case that the character of its miniatures was determined by the pictorial narrative technique which is found in numerous illuminated manuscripts of chivalric epics executed in the style of various European schools of painting in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.55 We now pass to our most important problem, the discussion of the first pictorial cycle of the Epistola in the Pantheon. Following the migration of motifs in medieval manuscripts of the Alexander-legend, we find that the oldest known Italian cycle of miniatures in the Pantheon, i.e. that in the Paris Pantheon, shows resemblances to the illustrative cycle of the Roman de toute Chevalerie. Most of its scenes which correspond to miniatures of the Paris Pantheon, are preserved only in the Paris copy of the Roman. This contains, however, a rather late (c. 1300) copy of a picture-cycle which was devised in England before 1250.56 54A detailed analysis of all the animal motifs mentioned is beyond the scope of the present article. Examples closely comparable to the 'heraldic' lions and birds of prey in the Sandomierz MS (Pls. 6a, 7f) may be found in Austria (cf. the lions in the Walling Missal of c. I3'1o-see G. Schmidt, Die Malerschule von St. Florian, Linz 1962, pp. 6o-6i, pl. I9, and the eagles in the famous Musterbuch of Reun; see R. W. Scheller, A Survey of Medieval Model-Books, Haarlem 1963, pp. 84-87, fig. 35). Of the dragons depicted in miniature 14 of the Sandomierz Pantheon (P1. 6c), the first, winged and with elongated ears and twisted tail, represents a type that was fairly popular in the painting of the I3th-I 4th centuries; the second, with serrated back and a characteristic fan-like tail, is a very rare specimen. The motif closest to the orna- mentally treated tail-fan occurs in Scan- dinavian art, for example in the late I3th- century polychrome fresco in the church in Frdjel (B. G. S6derberg, Gotldndska kalkmdl- ningar 1200-1400, Uppsala 1971, pp. 109-11, fig. 40). 55 I allude to the definition of F. Saxl ('The Troy Romance in French and Italian Art', in his Lectures, London 1957, PP. 127-8): 'a new narrative style in painting'-and in particular to Saxl's analysis of the Italian illustrations of chivalric epics (ibid., pp. 132- 133). Undoubtedly, not every deviser of these picture-cycles was a Matthew Paris but the new style gave liberty in illustrating the narrative as well as the possibility of stressing its dramatic value. In Poland the introduc- tion of this style occurred after some delay, perhaps because the historical situation at the turn of the I3th and 14th centuries was unfavourable. 56 Ross, Alexander, pp. 25-26.</page><page sequence="20">ALEXANDER'S INDIAN CAMPAIGN 67 Cycle IE i shows considerable originality. Its illustrations were designed following the text, and indeed the special variants of its own (Pantheon) version of that text. Nevertheless, the miniatures of the Paris Pantheon are clearly related to those of the Paris manuscript of the Roman. First, in the composi- tional formulas used in the punishment of the Indian guides (Pls. 5d, 7e)57 and in the fight with the giant bats (P1. 6g, j). For the present further similarities in the characterization of the monsters: the 'serpentes', the 'cancri' represented as dragons, and the 'nycticoraces' as owls are omitted.58 Had these two cycles been connected directly, that is had the designer of one of them followed an illustrated copy of the other, the marked icono- graphic relationships would hardly have been limited to so few scenes. This is especially true of the copiously illustrated Roman de toute Chevalerie, which could have provided the master of Cycle IE I with an ampler set of subjects and a multitude of easily copied motifs.59 There seems rather to be no reason to reject the hypothesis of the previous existence of a western European archetype which was the source both of the Italian Cycle IE I and of the corresponding group of miniatures in the Roman de toute Chevalerie. This hypothesis can also be illustrated by a diagram.

Diagram illustrating a Western European archetype as source for Italian Cycle IE I and miniatures in the Roman de Toute Chevalerie. 57 The basic structure and layout of the composition as well as the grouping of figures in both miniatures are almost identical. Alexander sits enthroned on the left; the surface of the water in the right lower corner of the illustration is shown by a similar arrangement of diagonal wavy lines; two armed knights (in the Paris Pantheon a Mace- donian clad in a short tunic) throw the con- demned guides into the water (in Paris there is a winged monster-the hippopotamus-in the river). 58 Cf. Pls. 5b, c, g; 6e, f; 7c, d. In these the influence of the Bestiary iconographic tradition may also have played a part. On the 'nycticoraces' see n. 49 above. 59 Cycle IE I could not have originated in a selection from the illustrative cycle of the Roman as several episodes based on the text of the Epistola and depicted in the Paris Roman are lacking in IE I (cf. P1. 4f). On the other hand there are subjects illustrated in IE I which are not shown in the Roman. The picture-cycle of the Roman may have in- fluenced the already existing Italian Cycle IE I, as was the case with the Historia de Preliis cycle and its influence on Cycle IE 2. Nevertheless, traceable relations are here so few that it would be risky to suggest that an illuminated copy of the Roman was accessible to the painter of the Paris Pantheon. The same objections could be made to a possible in- fluence of the Italian Cycle IE I on the genesis or development of the illustrations of the Roman.</page><page sequence="21">68 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA In the present state of knowledge it is hardly possible to solve decisively one of the most perplexing problems: what was the oldest illustrated source of this iconographic tradition of Alexander's Indian campaign? Was this archetype the earliest nucleus of the picture-cycle of the Roman de toute Chevalerie or-as seems more probable-was it an illustrated copy of the Epistola quite independent of the Pantheon? This latter hypothesis is per- haps too bold since no cycle of illustrations for Alexander's Letter has survived except that found in the manuscripts of the Pantheon. However, we cannot wholly exclude the possibility that even before the final shaping of Cycle IE I in Italian manuscripts of the Pantheon, there existed illustrated texts of the Epistola, few in number and perhaps incorporated in collectanea of a quasi- scientific character, with a small set of illustrations. It may be remembered that in England a strong interest in the text of Alexander's Letter already existed by about Iooo,60 and, at the same time, there was a local tradition of illustrating the Letter of Pharasmanes, the cycle of the Marvels of the East.61 This supposition can be regarded only as a point of departure for further research.62 Nevertheless, it could well explain the character and structure of Cycle IE I. In the latter, we have noted that there is agreement, even if only partial, of the pictures with the specific text of the Epistola as it appears in the Pantheon. But how can we explain the fact that this particular text alone is illustrated while all the remaining chapters of Godfrey's world chronicle were left without any regular illustration? And there arises also a further question; why does Cycle IE I open only with the events at the bitter river, the siege of the castle and the attack of the hippopotami? It is true that in view of the uni- versal popularity of the Epistola in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it would be understandable that the patron ordering an Italian Pantheon should have selected this very section of the manuscript for illustration. Nevertheless, if the painter had been left to make his own translation of the text of the Epistola into pictorial form, he would probably have begun either with the battle with Porus, or with Alexander's visit to the royal palace, or with the march through the desert. It is thus not impossible that the Italian artist had an earlier model in which the first miniatures of the cycle had been destroyed or, perhaps more probably, a model where only certain themes were depicted, namely the portrait of Alexander at the beginning, the siege of the castle, the punishment of the guides, a few scenes of the fighting with reptiles and animals and perhaps also the oracle of the miraculous trees. It would be difficult to suggest another explanation of the arrangement 60 Ross, Alexander, p. 29 and n. I I I (biblio- graphy). Some interest in this text in St. Albans is shown by the portrait of Alexander signed by Matthew Paris (according to Rickert) preceding Alexander's Letter in an English miscellany of the early I3th century (Cambridge, University Library, MS Kk.iv.26; cf. M. Rickert, La miniature anglaise du Xlle au XVe s., Milan i961, p. 17, pl. 14). 61 See M. R. James, The Marvels of the East, Oxford 1929; Wittkower, op. cit., pp. I72-3; Ross, Alexander, pp. 32-33- 62 If we may accept the hypothesis of a common prototype of Cycle IE I and of the Roman de toute Chevalerie, we must also assume that one copy of such an hypothetical manu- script was preserved in England while another was accessible in Italy. The importation of English manuscripts into Italy was not im- probable in the 12th century in view of the connexions of the kingdom of Sicily with England, and in the I3th, given the contacts of Frederick II with English scholars and his marriage with Princess Isabella.</page><page sequence="22">ALEXANDER'S INDIAN CAMPAIGN 69 of the illustrations of Cycle IE I and particularly to explain the fact that large sections of the text were left unillustrated in contrast with the peculiar concentration of the miniatures in the sequence showing the battles with the beasts. The Paris Pantheon may well reflect the first stage in the illustrating of Godfrey's treatise. At the beginning of the manuscript (opening of Particula I) is placed a small miniature of God as creator. Then only, at a considerable distance from it, at the opening of Particula XVII, it is followed by the next, the miniature of Alexander enthroned. If we may assume that for the anonymous owner of the manuscript Alexander was the central personage of the Pantheon, it is possible that this Italian patron had supplied his painter with an imported manuscript containing illustrations of the Epistola, which the artist was able to copy and develop into a longer narrative cycle. The creator of Cycle IE I was also probably well acquainted with motifs from the bestiary. On the other hand, originality in the sphere of composition and scenery was his weak point. Having copied the image of Alexander enthroned, he repeated the same enthroned figure in subsequent scenes, in defiance of the situation described in the text. It is possible that this way of representing Alexander accorded best with his idea of a ruler.63 When representing the king fighting with monsters and wild beasts he reused his iconographic formula for this scene in a series of miniatures. This constant repetition brought him finally into conflict with the text, so that he showed Alexander fighting with the 'nycticoraces' and attacked by the emerald- bearing serpents in the valley of Diardinis, which is contrary to the account of these episodes in the text of Epistola.64 We are faced here with the interesting problem of the conception of Alexander in Cycle IE I, in the two basically different ideas of the king: Alexander imperator, the type of the ruler enthroned giving orders to his knights, and Alexander fighter of the monsters. The first appears in the scenes which correspond to miniatures 3-5 and 7-8 of the Paris Pantheon (Pls. 4b, 5d), while in the later scenes Alexander usually appears as a lonely warrior fighting with the beasts (Pls. 6g, 7c, 8b). It is significant, that both these concepts are traceable also in the Paris manuscript of the Roman de toute Chevalerie in the illustration of the section based on the Epistola. In the miniature showing the punishment of the guides (P1. 7e) Alexander is represented enthroned; in the miniatures depicting the combats with the beasts (Pls. 5g, 6h-k) the king marches to battle at the head of his companions. It is he himself who pierces the heart of a leaping lion with his spear; it is he who bars the way to rapacious tigers, strange, feline monsters with great paws, and he who inflicts a mortal wound upon the awe-inspiring odontotyrannus. This heroic role of Alexander and his decisive part in the battles are much more stressed here than in the corresponding scenes of the Leipzig Historia de Preliis and the Bodleian Roman d'Alexandre. In the Indian sequence of the Roman de toute Chevalerie and in Cycle IE I 63 Cf. n. 44 above (P1. 4b). 64 Pis. 7c, 8b; Boer, pp. 21-22. The text of the Epistola says that Macedonian knights saw large birds fishing in the lake and that, in the valley of Diardinis, they found emerald- bearing serpents fighting one another (cf. PI. 8d). They were not, however, attacked by these monsters.</page><page sequence="23">70 KRYSTYNA SECOMSKA the image of Alexander as the conqueror of monsters is ultimately pre- dominant. In no other pictorial cycle of the legend is the heroism of Alexander triumphant over the demonic forces of Nature emphasized so strongly. In the Leipzig Historia and in the Bodleian Roman d'Alexandre Alexander is first of all the great commander or the knight victorious in single combat. In Cycle IE 2, as may be inferred from the Sandomierz miniatures, he is characterized in the same spirit as 'le preux chevalier'; on the other hand certain elements of the original illustrative cycle are there lost.65 In the Gothic miniatures of the Sandomierz Pantheon the battle with the beasts is more picturesque than dramatic: the animals are slender and well-shaped, and their decorative aspect is often stressed (Pls. 6c, 7j, 81); for example, the supple serpentine dragons give the spectator aesthetic satisfaction rather than an impression of horror. Compared with this pictorial fable of the Macedonian campaign, the dramatic atmosphere of the corresponding sequence in the Paris Pantheon and in the Paris Roman de toute Chevalerie is effective by contrast. There grim, heavy monsters attack the knights lost in the wilderness (Pls. 6f, 7m, 8j). The 'bestiary' visual vocabulary of both these early cycles of the Alexander-legend brings to mind Romanesque animal sculpture with its rich symbolism of man-eating monsters. It is possible that the oldest cycle of illustrations of the Epistola was created not only to satisfy an interest in mirabilia, as was certainly the case with the Letter of Pharasmanes. It also seems likely that its designer saw in Alexander an incarnation of an eternal myth, the hero triumphant over the beasts, which has left its traces in early medieval art, especially in Northern Europe, in the images of Sigurd and St. Michael.66 A remote echo of these legends sounds from the sublime doors of Gniezno Cathedral, where the deeds of St. Adalbert are accompanied by monsters and man-eaters lurking in the foliate scrolls. The martyr-athleta Dei-sets out on his mission to battle with the powers of evil.67 The foregoing investigation needs to be continued in further studies of the origins of the iconography of Alexander's Indian exploits, which might usefully take into account the various versions of 'hero fighting beast', especially in the early medieval art of Northern Europe. For, apart from the present suggestion concerning the illuminated Epistola, namely the existence of a hypothetical common model of the picture-cycles of the Roman de toute Chevalerie and 'IE I', the assumption of an interchange of certain iconographic formulas seems quite plausible, not only within the field of the Alexander- 65 The Sandomierz painter shows the king only in a few scenes, at the beginning of the cycle, in the camp at the lake and twice at the oracle of the prophetic trees (cf. Pls. 4a, 5a, 8e). In other miniatures we cannot distinguish Alexander in the crowd of knights as the painter did not supply him with distinctive attributes. Presumably in the lost model of the Sandomierz Pantheon the king was shown in these scenes in full armour, but distin- guished by a small crown on his helmet, as in many other picture-cycles of the legend (e.g. in the Leipzig Historia; cf. P1. 6d). 66 Cf. E. A. Seaver, 'Some examples of Viking figure representation in Scandinavia and in the British Isles', in Medieval Studies in memory of A.

Research on the general theme of the dragon-killer in the field of literature and the visual arts has only begun. Indeed, we should not overlook the important part played by the Anglo- Norman area in the invasion of the medieval art of the Continent by fantastic motifs.68 It is in this artistic culture that the original cycle of illustrations for the Roman de toute Chevalerie was created. It is possible that the ideological and iconographic concept of Alexander as the conqueror of Indian monsters was also born and first formulated in the same milieu. National Museum of Warsaw 68 Cf.
