(Abhandlungen zur Kunst-, Musik- und Literaturwissenschaft, Band 7.) Bonn: H. Bouvier u. Co. Verlag, 1959. Pp. 488. DM 19.50. The Wolfram scholarship of recent years has tended to concern itself primarily</page><page sequence="2">io8 Johnson with the interpretation of the main ideas of Wolfram's works, to develop certain major concepts, and to demonstrate Wolfram's attitudes toward life and toward his time. Naturally Wolfram's religious views have received particular attention. There has been a series of studies from Gottfried Weber's Der Gottesbegrif des Parzival (1935) through J. Schwietering's Parzivals Schuld (1944), H. Schneider's Parzival Studien (1947), W. J. Schroder's Der Ritter zwischen Gott und Welt (1952), to P. Wapnewski's Wolframs Parzival: Studien zur Religiosit?t und Form (1955), to mention only a few. With so much research on Wolfram's religiosity already published, it comes as no surprise to find a book which now reviews the results of such research critically and which attempts to "fix" Wolfram's position anew amid the religious currents of his age. Although the intention of the author is to define Wolfram's position, the value of the study actually lies rather in his comprehensive presentation of the literature. As a means of orientation in the research on Wolfram's religiosity, Koppitz's study is indeed quite valuable. It has an extensive bib liography of over 50 pages. The reader should not, however, be deceived by the size of the book since it is a photomechanical reproduction of typewritten pages and hence appears larger than it actually is. Nevertheless, the approxi mately 450 items listed include not only those dealing exclusively with Wolfram, but also many items on the various religious movements of the Middle Ages. Koppitz's book is a revision of his dissertation (Bonn, 1954). It takes into account the pertinent literature to 1957. Koppitz seeks to describe Wolfram's religiosity by looking for elements in Wolfram's works that give evidence of influence from the older (pre-twelfth century) Christian tradition and from those more recent religious trends of, for example, Bernhard of Clairvaux. Then, after a discussion of Wolfram's ethics and his concept of the Grail in relation to medieval religious traditions, Koppitz examines those characteristics of Wolfram's religiosity that have been described as anticipating some aspects of Thomism and later German mysticism. Koppitz does all this largely on the basis of certain words and images which recur in Wolfram's works. Herein lies the greatest weakness in Koppitz's method. As he readily admits, he is not always able to establish beyond doubt whether a particular concept, for example, triuwe, is used in a religious, ethical, or feudal sense. Such situations arise not only from am biguity in the interpretation of the passages in question, but also from the lack of well-defined religious terminology in MHG, as opposed to the more clearly circumscribed Latin and Greek terms. Nevertheless, Koppitz develops roughly a picture of Wolfram's religiosity dominated by the older Augustinian world view, strongly influenced by an Old Testament concept of God as judge and avenger, combined with certain traits that occur in the Revelation to John from the New Testament. In addition, Wolfram sees God as a feudal lord with knightly characteristics and obligations, related to mankind through Christ's incarnation. Opposed to this anthropomorphic God and in contest with Him is the devil, whom Wolfram depicts as a very real person, not as a mere symbol for the abstract concept of evil. This, then, is Wolfram's untutored, popular image of God. It is dis played against the background of the history of the world, seen not as a series</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 109 of historical events, but rather as the story of salvation. Interestingly enough, Koppitz derives this picture almost exclusively from Wolfram's Parzival. Wolfram's Willehalm, on the other hand, is the source for most of the traits that Koppitz ascribes to the "newer" intellectual currents of the twelfth century, such as emphasis on the Trinity, the human side of Christ's passion, the Virgin Mary, and the religious concept of love. Of course one can not draw a sharp dividing line between the two works, nor does Koppitz attempt to do so. Much has been written about Wolfram's ethics and in particular about his tolerance and Humanit?t in connection with his treatment of the heathens. Koppitz sounds a note of warning by pointing up the difficulty of ascertaining precisely what Wolfram's ethical concepts are, in view of the fact that Wolfram's ethical terminology is not used exclusively to denote strictly ethical concepts. Koppitz sees some Germanic and even some Franciscan traits in Wolfram's predominantly Christian-Augustinian ethics, however. He warns, too, against applying modern ideas of tolerance to Wolfram's treatment of the heathens. While Wolfram does not disparage the heathens in respect to their knightly virtues (indeed he rather praises them), he gives no indication at all of admitting even the possibility that their religion has any validity. He rather points to the folly of their unbelief. In reference to the Grail, Koppitz examines all evidence of medieval Christian tradition and comes to the conclusion that there is little that can be so described exclusively. On the other hand the non-Christian elements abound. This does not mean that Wolfram was aware of the origin of such elements, which Koppitz depicts, leaning heavily on Jesse Weston's theories of the evolution of the Grail legend. Ultimately, however, the Grail is a symbol, to be interpreted in a religious way. It points to the eucharist, to paradise, to eternal bliss, and to the ideal that Parzival seeks: the union of God and the world. Finally, Koppitz speaks out decisively against Schwietering, W. J. Schr?der, and Weber. He sees no demonstrable close relationship of Wolfram to German mysticism, nor does he admit more than a remote possibility of heretical (Catharian) views in Wolfram's works. As to Wolfram's alleged anticipation of Aquinas, Koppitz agrees that it is a possibility, but by no means so strong as has been suggested by others. One closes Koppitz's book with a sense of frustration. Koppitz has under taken a tremendous task in attempting to define Wolfram's religious views in terms of theological history, but he has devoted so much of his study to demonstrating why it is not possible to view Wolfram from a certain stand point or why it is highly improbable to look at him from another, that one despairs of finding a positive way of viewing the problem at all. One is inclined to agree with Koppitz, when he says in his conclusion: "Es ist ohnehin mi?lich, poetische Denkm?ler?und seien sie von Goethe, Shakespeare oder Dante?zu Objekten philosophischer oder theologischer Untersuchungen zu machen und mit den Werken der Philosophen und Theologen zu vergleichen."
