<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studia Islamica, 2001 Mihna as Self-Defense* Throughout the second and third centuries A.H., a vehement controversy over the standing of theology threatened the cohesion of the Islamic com- munity. One of the issues that divided the Muslims was the question of the createdness of the Qur' in. This debate led to the intervention of the caliphal court, which initiated widescale interrogations of scholars between 218 and 233 A.H., a policy that is known as the mihna (Inquisition). In the course of this period, leaders of the religious community were questioned about their views regarding the Qur'in, and those who did not subscribe to the court's position that the Qur'an was created were put on trial, tortured and pressu- red to renounce their stance. After fifteen years of such persecutions and in the face of popular resistance, the caliph al-Mutawakkil put an end to this policy, effectively admitting its failure. Modem scholars view the mihna as one of the defining moments in Isla- mic history. As early as the nineteenth century this event drew their atten- tion, and in 1897, W. Patton published a monograph, Ahmed ibn Hanbal and the Mihna, which is still an authoritative and widely quoted account of the mihna. (') Although Patton focused on Ibn Hanbal's interrogation, he outli- ned the events that occurred before and after this episode. He challenged the interpretation that has been put forth by some Muslim historians according to which the mihna was instigated due to the machinations of courtiers that surrounded the caliph, and placed the onus of responsibility on the caliph himself.(2) He also suggested that the mihna is closely related to al- Ma'miin' s Shi' i leanings. () However, the importance of Patton's work does not lie in the specific motives that he ascribed to al-Ma'mfin, but in articu- * I would like to thank S. Kaplan, N. Tsafrir and D.

Throughout the twentieth century historians have followed Patton's lead. (4) In the Encyclopaedia of Islam, M. Hinds posed the question: "Why should al-Ma'mhn have wished to institute a mihna at all," (5) inadvertently revealing his opinion that al-Ma'm-n's motives are the key to understanding the purpose and dynamics of the mihna. He then moved on to summarize the answers that several modem scholars offered - all of which focused on al- Ma'miin. In a recent article, J.A. Nawas also asked what drove al-Ma'min to establish the mihna. (6) He divided the works that were surveyed into three types. The first and second argue that al-Ma'muin was inspired by the Mu'tazilis and Shi'is. Nawas also mentions Madelung's and van Ess's convincing articles that demonstrate that al-Ma' mn is unlikely to have ini- tiated the mihna in order to advance the political interests of the Mu'tazilis and Shi'is.(7) The third explanation suggests that the mihna occurred because the caliph wanted to establish himself as the supreme arbiter in spi- ritual matters. Nawas, Hinds and most of the historians they mention tend to adopt this explanation. (8) The mihna, as they see it, is the outcome of al- Ma'm0n's efforts to advance the caliphs' "religious authority" at the expense of the 'ulamd'. All of these historians, which disagree about the specific reason that led al-Ma' mhn to initiate the mihna, share the notion that understanding the milhna depends on uncovering al-Ma'mun's motives. As a result of their "single person" approach, modern accounts of the mihna have neglected its historical context. Evidence to this blind spot are the numerous studies of al-Ma' min' s role in the instigation of the mihna and scarcity of studies that focus on other factors that may have left their mark on this policy. It is fair to conclude that the "single person" narrative came at the expense of other venues of investigation. The "single person" narrative, that has dominated modem scholarship of the mihna, is not a novel interpretation. It first appeared approximately a thousand years ago in Hanbali and Sunni texts. After the Hanbalis and other Sunnis that opposed kalam overcame the mihna's administrators, they wrote about their heroic stand in a manner that reflected their understanding of the (4) One important exception is J. van Ess, who studied Ibn Abi Du'id closely.

One of the themes that they elaborated in their accounts was the ascription of the mifhna to al-Ma'min and his closest entourage. In so doing, they have laid the foundation of the "single person" narrative. When modem scholars examined Islamic sources they found that the majority of texts follow this line of description, and they utilized them without questioning the evidence itself nor its underlying historiographic assumptions. As a consequence, modern accounts resemble the Hanbali- Sunni narrative and offer similar explanations to the initiation of the mihna. The mainstay of the Hanbali-Sunni narratives of the mihna are the reports by S.lih b. Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 266) and Hanbal b. Ishaq (d. 273).(9) Both were disciples and relatives of Ahmad b. IHanbal (d. 241): The first was his son; the second was his cousin. Moreover, both ascribe most of the anec- dotes that they report to their mentor. Salih is cited widely by Hanbali and non-Hanbali authors that refer to the mihna, such as AbN Nu'aym al-Isfahnmi (d. 430), Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597) and al-Dhahabi (d. 748).(10) All of these authors shared the assumption that al-Ma' m-n and a few evil advisors were the sole perpetrators of the mihna and that it was continued after his death because he commanded his successor, al-Mu'tasim (d. 227), to do so. Another Sunni account of the mihna, which is often used by modem scholars, is al-Tabari's Ta'rikh al-rusul wa-'l-mulak. (") However, despite the features that it shares with the Hanbali-Sunni account, it also stands apart from them. Al-Tabari's account resembles the Hanbali-Sunni narrative in that it too emphasizes the nexus between policy and personality. This comes across most clearly in the extensive attention he gives al-Ma'mfin's letters. On the other hand, al-Ma' min is an adherent of kalam and his letters convey a mutakallim's view of the mihna, which differs greatly from the Hanbali- Sunni version. As a consequence, although al-Tabari is a Sunni faqih who adopts the IHanbali-Sunni premises which focus on al-Ma'miin, he inadver- tently airs the mutakallim interpretation of the mifhna. Despite the centrality of the Hanbali-Sunni narrative and its posthumous victory, it was not the sole historiographic trend among Muslims who wrote about the mihna. The mutakalliman viewed this event differently and their writings give vent to their interpretation. Their emphasis was on the missing piece of the Hanbali-Sunni narrative: its historic background. They did not see the mimhna as the outcome of court intrigue nor did they emphasize the initiative of any single individual. Rather, they focused on wider intellectual and political developments such as inter-factional strife among the 'ulamd'. (9) For a presentation of these sources, see van Ess, Theologie, Im, 456-457.

In the course of this struggle the muhaddithun succeeded in landing a sequence of hard blows on the mutakallimain. After al-Ma'mfin came to power and extended his support to the mutakallimfin, the pendulum of power swung in their favor and it was their chance to strike at the muhaddithfin. Such a narrative implies that the mutakallimin were not the original aggressors but rather the victims of the muhaddithfn. Mutakallimifn writings about the mihna are the narrative of the vanqui- shed, which has been relegated to the sidelines by classic Islamic historians and modem scholars of the period. Recently, however, scholars have given non-Sunni accounts more attention. M. Hinds, M. Cooperson and J. van Ess, which rely on the works of al-Jahiz, al-Mas'idi and al-Ya'qibi, put forth a revisionist narrative of Ibn .Hanbal's interrogation.(12) Noting discrepancies and improbable elements in the Hanbali-Sunni narrative, they turned to the previously ignored non-Sunni accounts. They question if Ibn Hanbal truly maintained his original position after being tortured, and if he did, why was he released while all other "theological" prisoners were kept in jail. This study follows the revisionist trend that integrates non-Sunni sources into the evolving modem narratives of the mihna. However, it does not deal with Ibn Hanbal's interrogation, but with mutakallimmin works on the mifhna's origins and background. In what follows I shall examine two texts, both written by adherents of kaldm, that present how the mutakallimun thought about the causes of the mihna. The first text is the Risdla fi nafy al- tashbih, whose author is al-Jbhiz. Although C. Pellat and W. al-Qadi have noted this work, it was ignored by most modem studies of the mifhna. (') The second is the well known and widely quoted letter by al-Ma'mtn, that appears in al-Tabari's Ta'rikh, in which he orders to start the interrogations in Baghdad. However, despite its wide circulation, little attention has been paid to the historical discussion that appears in the body of the letter, where al-Ma' miin reveals himself as a spokesman of the mutakallimufn. It is on this second part of the letter that this study will concentrate. The effort to unearth an alternative narrative of the mifhna is important in and of itself. It is interesting and important to take into consideration that the mutakallimun perceived the mihna as an act of self-defense. However, I believe that the potential contribution of the mutakalliman's descriptions of the mihna's origins is greater than the uncovering of another interpretation.

Bahr al-Kindni al-Fuqaymi al-Basri, known as al- Jahiz, died in the year 255/868-869, at the age of ninety five.((") In the course of his long life he witnessed some of the pivotal events of the early Islamic civilization, including the mihna. An indefatigably curious indivi- dual of great talents, who has been described as "probably the greatest Ara- bic prose writer of all times," (6) he studied and wrote about a wide variety of topics. A brilliant autodidact, he began his education by "wandering about the city [Basra], mingling with the crowds and joining the circles of listeners that gathered around some of the more famous masters."(") In the course of his search for knowledge he met some of the most important intellectuals of the era, such as ai-Asma'i (d. 213) with whom he studied philology, Abui Y-suf (d. 182), the Qdcdi al-Quddt with whom he studied hadith, and Thumama b. Ashras (d. 213) and al-Nazzam (d. 221), with whom he studied theology. ("8) Like many scholars of the second and third centuries A.H., al-Jahiz took a stand on the politics of culture and faith. He was a Mu'tazili whose theo- logical writings are mostly lost, but his extant pro-Mu'tazili political wri- tings reveal interesting insights about that period. An example of such work is his Risalaft nafy al-tashbih, which presents the mihna from the mutakal- limfin's point of view. Written around 220 A.H., two years after the interro- gation began, it was addressed to Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Abi Du'ad (d. 239), the son of Ibn Abi Du'id (d. 240) the Mu'tazili Qddi al-Quddit who was the mihna's zealous administrator. (g) The Risila barely touches on questions of doctrine. Instead, it focuses on power struggles that are related to theology. Its opening paragraph reflects al-Jdhiz's agenda quite accurately: You - may Allah bestow honor upon you - are aware of people's beliefs regarding anthropomorphism (al-qaul bi-'l-tashbih), their cooperation with it (14) Al-JRhiz, "Risdlafi nafy al-tashbih," in ed.

(20) The main themes in this passage, as well as in the rest of the essay, are the social and political contexts of the controversy over anthropomorphism. Al-Jdhiz begins by stating that the disagreement is splitting the community of believers into two camps. He then continues with a statement against anthropomorphist views, but concedes that the sinning anthropomorphists have become influential due to the support of the masses ('awcmm). What al-Jahiz finds most upsetting is the manner that the masses, whom he consi- ders to be ignorant boors, interfere in theological discourse. Such conduct reflects and aggravates social and intellectual disorder, and has led to a cri- sis of spiritual leadership. In al-Jalhiz's words: "the elite (khd.s.sa) do not have power over the masses ('amma) and the people of distinction ('ilya) have no power over the contemptible (arddhil)."(21) Who are the khassa and 'namma? As the terms appear in the Risdla, they do not designate particular movements. In order to identify their specific meanings, we need to pick up on the hints that al-Jahiz left in the text itself. The first clue about their identity which appears in the opening paragraph cited above, indicates that they embraced anthropomorphic beliefs and tur- ned to anthropomorphists for religious guidance. Another clue that can help us understand what al-Jahiz had in mind is the link he makes between the "amma and the hashwiyya.(22) Of the hashwiyya we read in a study by A.S. Halkin, who propounds that they can "be identified with the anti- Mu'tazilites." (') He also suggests that the term hashwiyya is identical with Nabita, and both are used to describe the opponents to the theological enter- prise. (24) A case in point is their attitude towards theological investigations that are inspired by Qur'anic exegesis. Their slogan "bild kaifa" (without how), states explicitly their refusal to inquire into the meaning of obscure verses in the Qur'an. Rather, they propose a literal reading of the divine texts. To them, theological inquiry has very little space in Islamic religiosity. Indeed, the terms Nabita, hashwiyya and ahl al-tashbih were used inter- changeably in al-Jilhiz's writings, all referring to ignoramuses that oppose theological inquiry. According to him, these groups got the better of the amma and created an intellectual climate that was intolerable for the muta- (20) Al-Jdhiz, "al-tashbih," 283. (21). Ibid. (22) Ibid., 288, 289.

From al-J~hiz's point of view, the pact between the 'dmma, and the hashwiyya, NMbita and ahl al-tashbih was a tragic development, which threw the 'dmma off the path of true faith and upset the socio-intellectual order of the Islamic community. The link that Halkin makes between the .hashwiyya, Nabita and Hanbalis, and their collective repudiation of theology, is mentioned in the writings of Ahmad b. Hanbal (d.241), who was the mutakalliman's arch-enemy: "And as for the ashab al-ra'y they call the ashdab al-sunna: Nabita and Hashwiyya. The ashab al-ra'y lie.., they infer in matters of faith by means of istifhsan (discretion)."(25) Ibn IHanbal' s remark about the derogatory appellations that the ahl al-ra'y use against the ahl al-sunna, (i.e., Nabita or hashwiyya) indi- cates that these insults were widely known. Interestingly, like al-J.hiz, Ahmad b. Hanbal observes that the feature that distinguishes the ashab al- ra'y from the ashdcb al-sunna, is the latter's refusal to recognize the legiti- macy of inquiries into the nature of Allah. In other words, both agree that theological investigation is the pertinent issue of contention between the 'dmma and their opponents. Who are the khdssa in al-Jaliz's vision of society? Similar to the case of the 'dimma when the term khassa stands alone it does not signify a specific group. However, al-Jahiz's use of the term reveals that he associates this group with the mutakalliman, since he uses the two interchangeably and positions both of them against the 'dmma. An excellent example of the man- ner that al-Jahiz places the khassa and mutakllimiin against the 'dmma is the following remark: "If they ('awdmm) were without the mutakalliman... they could not keep abreast with the khassa and not with the people of complete knowledge."(26) This remark spells out that the mutakallim-n are part of the kh.ssa, and the only way to become part of the khassa is to acquire theolo- gical knowledge. Their counter image are the 'amma who either rely on the mutakallimin to educate them and in so doing rise above their low standing, or remain uneducated riffraff. It is therefore knowledge and attitude towards knowledge that define these vague social categories in al-Jahiz's writings. One of the most fascinating and valuable aspects of al-JaTiz's Risdla is his candid discussion of the mutakallimifn's fear of the damma. This emotion was noted by W. al-Qadi in her insightful study, "The Earliest "Nabita" and the Paradigmatic "Nawabit,"(27) in which she mentions five reactions of the mutakallimin to the Nabita, of which the most relevant to this study is fear. (2") Al-Qadi quotes al-Jahiz's frank admission of his anxiety: "Just as we fear them, we have hopes for them, just as we are wary of them we have expectations for them."(') She also observes that the mutakalliman had 25) Ibn Abi Ya'li, Tabaqdt al-Hanabila (Cairo, 1952), 36.

(30) The extent of the fear that the anthropomorphists instilled in the muta- kallimfn, and the damage that this fear wrought upon them, is described by al-Jahiz in the following remark: "You [Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Abi Du'ad] know about the rejection of the evidence (shahddat) furnished by the muwahhidun (mutakallimun) [in court] and of the intimidation of the muta- kallimun scholars (ikhdfat 'ulama' al-mutakallimun)." (3) The opening words, "you know" suggest that it was well known that the mutakallimun were victims of persecution and, therefore, feared to speak their mind or spread their beliefs in public. This statement, and others such as "time was when they relied on power, strength, numbers and good fortune, on the alle- giance of ruffians and the dregs of the populace;...," (32) reveal that al-Jihiz felt that the mutakallimun were under the constant pressure of the anthropo- morphists. Moreover, it suggests that the mutakallimun felt they were unable to operate freely in the intellectual environment that the muhaddithun crea- ted. It is at this point that we ought to examine how al-Jihiz ties between the anthropomorphists' aggressions, the mutakallimin's fears and the initiation of the mihna: All this lasted - may Allah bestow honor upon you - until Allah detrac- ted from their force and reduced their power... Until Allah converted to us men from their leaders and scholars... and until the mihna was turned against them and they took to dissimulation. And all this was due to your sheikh and our sheikh... (33) It is the mihna that enabled the mutakallimun to raise their heads, speak their minds and establish themselves in their proper role in society. Such jus- tice could come about only after the mihna reversed the power relations between the previously persecuted mutakallimun and their oppressors, the anthropomorphists. It was only when the muhaddithfn's scare tactics colli- ded with the more powerful imperial apparatus, that they changed their behavior and in some cases fostered a respectable debate with the mutakal- limun. Thus, when al-Jaihiz compares the oppression of the past to the coope- ration of the present, he writes of the mihna as the point of transition. The theme of "before and after" the mihna comes up several times in the Risala. The contrast between the past in which the mutakallimun were per- secuted and the present, in which they enjoy an influential position in society is reiterated in the following observation "today, having failed to maintain (30) Al-Qadi, 51. (31) Al-Jihiz, "al-tashbih," 285 (32).Ibid., 288; tr. Pellat, 51. (33) Ibid., 285. 100</page><page sequence="9">MIHNA AS SELF-DEFENSE their powerful position with support of the rabble and laborers, merchants and disaffected officials, they have become more amenable and open to argument;..."(34) Prior to the mihna, the anthropomorphists forged alliances with varying segments of society and built a large body of followers that opposed kaldm. These networks of rabble and merchants, led to the isolation of the mutakalliman. Al-Jahiz senses a change in the mutakalliman's stan- ding after the interrogations began. At that time the opponents softened up and channels of communication were established. This is not to say that they became loyal supporters of kalam, but that they were willing to concede and respect the mutakallimfn's existence by engaging in polemics. According to al-Jahiz this critical dialogue came into being as a consequence of the anthropomorphists' realization that they lost power. Change in the relations between the two trends was the outcome of the anthropomorphists failure "to maintain their powerful position" within the populace. In still another comment about the mutakalliman's social standing, al- Jahiz repeats the before-after comparison. "... after forbidding kaldm they began to frequent our circles, and after turning a deaf ear they began to lis- ten..." (35) Here again, al-Jahiz contrasts between the mutakalliman's past, in which they were ignored and even abused by the anthropomorphists and the present in which the anthropomorphists listen and converse with the muta- kalliman. Despite the improvements in the mutakalliman's situation, al-Jahiz was not satisfied with their position in the Islamic community. Although they won the court's support and instigated a new religio-political policy that has put the anthropomorphists on the run, the mutakallimfin were still a minority that had to work hard in order to win over the hearts of many more suppor- ters. "You know that although the supporters of anthropomorphists have been crushed, reduced and subjected to the inquisition, their numbers have not decreased..."(36) The miihna was an important achievement that brought about profound changes, but had not completed the task. The mutakallimiin still had a long struggle ahead of them if they wanted to gain the support of the masses. Al-Ji.hiz knew fully well that the right to carry out theological investigations in the open, does not guarantee the support of the public and the coveted position of spiritual leadership. Al-Ja1iz's writings about the mihna differ from the HIanbali, Sunni and modem accounts in their emphasis on the events that led up to the interro- gations. His descriptions of the state of affairs before the mihna was initia- ted - the days when the muhaddithuin refused to include the mutakalliman in any intellectual exchange and actually silenced them - move the historio- graphic spotlights to the miihna's background. The most important, yet somewhat obscure, comments in al-Jahiz's narrative are his references to the (34) Ibid., 288; tr. Pellat, 52. (35) Ibid., 288.

This complaint already appeared two years earlier, in the letter of the most powerful indivi- dual in the 'Abbasid empire, the caliph al-Ma'muin. II. Al-Ma'miin's mihna letter It is widely known that al-Ma'mfin (d. 218/833) was a generous patron of intellectual projects. He supported translations of scientific and philosophi- cal texts and spent time with intellectuals who were conversant with these texts, often inviting them to participate in debates about theology.(37) The money spent on translations and the time spent with philosophers and muta- kalliman, suggest that al-Ma'mOn was genuinely interested in their views and believed in the importance of their enterprise. Several modern studies have attempted to pigeonhole al-Ma' min's beliefs and classify him as a member or supporter of one of the trends of kalam that were active in his times. (38) However, despite the importance of such a classi- fication, it will not take us very far in understanding why al-Ma'muin initiated the mihna. Al-Ma' miin's radical break from the neutral religious policy of his 'Abbasid predecessors was not the outcome of a doctrinal position. It grew out of an acute sense that all the trends of kalam were being ostracized and losing ground in the scholarly community. Therefore, the mihna is not so much about an article of faith such as the createdness of the Qur'dn, as it is about the mut- kallimun' s right, better yet obligation, to debate its createdness. It was first and foremost about the politics of theology. Al-Ma'mfmn, like al-Jaihiz, realized that despite the support from powerful patrons, the mutakallimun were not capable of reaching and influencing the masses. Outside the supportive environment of the courts, the mutakallimiin encountered adamant resistance and were even harassed and humiliated. He was also painfully aware of a growing gap between the way the mutakal- limun thought about themselves, i.e., as an intellectual and spiritual elite that deserves to guide the community, and the way they were perceived by their contemporaries. Al-Ma'mfin's mihna letters are a clear testament of these sentiments and of his wish to reverse this process through an aggressive reli- gious policy. The first letter is composed of four central themes. It opens with a state- ment regarding the spiritual authority of the caliph. The second theme deals with the 'amma's lack of intellectual abilities and their tendency to follow (37) For the prevalent portrayal of al-Ma'mfn's patronage which ascribes to him the foundation of the Bayt al-lHikma and the initiation of journeys to Byzantium in search of ancient Greek knowledge see M.G.S.

Gutas, Greek Thought, Arabic Culture, The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early 'Abbasid Society (2'-4*/8'-10), (London, 1998), 75-104. The thrust of of Gutas' argument is that much of what is ascribed to al-Ma'mun began before his time.

The third consists of theolo- gical arguments that were brought by al-Ma'mfin as proof that the Qur'an was created. The fourth were instructions to the governor of Baghdad regar- ding the interrogation and sanctions to be imposed on those who did not embrace his position. In this study I will concentrate on the first two issues, the caliph's spiritual authority and the 'dmma's straying beliefs. Modem scholars concentrated on the first part of the letter, in which al- Ma'muin states his opinion on the caliph's spiritual authority, and have come to understand it as an indication that he aspired to be the highest spiritual authority of the Islamic community.(39) However, these interpretations ascribe to al-Ma'mfin an ambition that he does not claim explicitly. Al- Ma'mfin's mihna letters do not sketch a spiritual hierarchy in which he is alone at the top. The opening statements of his first and third mihna letters can be understood as remarks that place him within an intellectual elite, whose members are expected to furnish spiritual guidance to the rest of the Muslim community, and not as a lone spiritual guide. In the first letter the role of religious supervision is ascribed to the "imams and caliphs."(40) According to al-Ma'muin, the imams (a'imma) and caliphs, not the caliphs alone, are to guard "God's religion" for they are the inheritors of the heri- tage of prophethood and it is in their hands that God entrusted "the tradition of knowledge."(41) Although it is not clear to whom al-Ma'mun refers when he writes a'imma, it is evident that he thought of spiritual guidance as a col- lective enterprise. The third mihna letter opens with the following words: "That which God has a right to expect from His representatives [or: caliphs, khulafdc'] on earth and from those entrusted by Him [umand', N.H.] with authority over His servants,..." (42) Here, again, the caliphs do not appear alone. They are in the company of the unidentifiable umand'. The term umand' is not any more specific than a'imma, and as a consequence we do not know who belongs to the elite that ought to guide the Islamic community. What is clear is that al- Ma'mfin does not state that he, in the capacity of caliph, stands above the spiritual elite. What is more, al-Ma'muin probably thinks of spiritual gui- dance as a collective task and not the domain of one individual. It seems, therefore, that according to al-Ma' min's vision, the caliphs need to be part of the spiritual elite that fosters knowledge, elaborates principles of investi- gation and abides by defined forms of debate. In a study of the translation movement by D. Gutas, a similar description of al-Ma'mfin is put forth. According to Gutas, al-Ma'mfuun "wanted to create a classfrom above who would be, together with him, in charge of reli- gion, and not the masses from below who, with their "hidden leaderships", (39) See fn. 10. (40) Al-Tabari, m, 1112; tr. Bosworth, 199. (41) Ibid.; tr. Bosworth, 200. (42) Al-Tabari, It, 1117; tr. Bosworth, 205. 103</page><page sequence="12">NIMROD HURVITZ would be in control." (43) I find Gutas's emphasis on the cooperation between al-Ma'mfin and the "class from above" a convincing assessment of al- Ma'mfin' s socio-intellectual vision. It is noteworthy that the members of this "class from above" shared between them an approach to knowledge that manifested itself in a set of a-priori assumptions about theological inquiry, and not necessarily specific articles of faith. As Gutas observes, these scho- lars would interact with each other and aspire to "convince others,... by means of debate and dialectic argumentation."("4) According to my unders- tanding of al-Ma'mun's mihna letters the caliphs, a'imma and umana' are the "class from above" whose task it was to elaborate and supervise the implementation of correct beliefs. Gutas also makes an important remark about the mihna. (45) He points out that it was an attempt to place disputation and debate at the top of the spiri- tual hierarchy. In other words, instead of the blind adherence to spiritual guides or evasion of thorny theological issues, al-Ma'mfun aspired to pro- mote an atmosphere of critical thought in which persuasion would determine theological doctrine. In placing lucid arguments above "blind adherence," al-Ma'min struck at the authority of muhaddithan scholars who opposed theological investigations. However, at this point I take issue with Gutas, who comments: 'The caliph could arrive at a judgement, and convince others that it was the proper one, by means of debate and dialectic argumentation."(4) This description has two pro- blems. The first, it assumes that the caliph elaborates religious ideas without consulting his intellectual environment. The depiction of a caliph that contem- plates in solitude and only then speaks with other intellectuals gives the impres- sion that he is on a higher intellectual rung than other members of the spiritual oligarchy. However, as I have argued above, we have no evidence that this is how al-Ma'mfin envisioned himself. The second problem is of greater reso- nance. If the caliph is to "convince others... by means of debate and dialectic argumentation" then his spiritual authority is not supreme. If he has to convince, then his word is not final, which suggests that the mere capacity of caliphate does not place him in an exceptional spiritual position. Moreover, discussion and persuasion flatten individual authority and place the authority of logic and prin- ciples of reason above it. In such a situation, the caliph does not possess a unique spiritual feature that places him above his interlocutors. If all sides present argu- ments, maybe his interlocutors will put forth a more convincing argument than the caliph. Thus, Gutas's description of the necessity of these intellectuals to per- suade each other by means of debate is convincing. At the same time these exchanges suggest that the caliph's authority in spiritual matters was equal to that of other members of the intellectual elite that surrounded him. (43) Gutas, 83.

(46) Ibid., 82. 104</page><page sequence="13">MIHNA AS SELF-DEFENSE The remarks in the first mihna letter that touch on the caliph's authority are short and constitute a small part of the letter. Most of the document addresses the growing power of the muhaddithan and the substantive theo- logical arguments against their position. Al-Ma'mfin was infuriated by the "masses from below," who knew nothing of theology but dared to challenge the mutakallimiin's spiritual leadership, and maintained that it was their scholars who deserve to lead the Islamic community. This is one of the com- ments that al-Ma'min makes about them: The Commander of the Faithful has realized that the broad mass and the overwhelming concentration of the base elements of the ordinary people and the lower strata of the commonality are those who, in all the regions and far horizons of the world have no farsightedness, or vision, or faculty of reaso- ning by means of such evidential proofs as God approves along the right way which He provides, or faculty of seeking illumination by means of the light of knowledge and God's decisive proofs [...] [These persons are] a people sunk in ignorance and in blindness about God, plunged into error regarding the true nature of His religion and His unity and faith in Him; [they are] a people who fall short of being able to grasp the reality of God as He should be recognized, to acknowledge Him exactly as He should be acknowledged and to distinguish between Him and His creation. This is because of the fee- bleness of their judgement, the deficiency of their intellects and their lack of facility in reflecting upon things and calling them to mind; ('7) Al-Ma' min's diatribe against the 'imma assumes that they are incapable of achieving meaningful intellectual accomplishments. Such limitations har- bor grave dangers, since true belief hinges upon understanding of theologi- cal matters. As a consequence, al-Ma'mfin expected to see masses that rely on the spiritual guidance of the elite. Instead, he was confronted by a com- monality that lacked "faculty of reasoning" and held to misguided notions about theology and theologians. It has been argued by F. Steppat that al-Ma'mfin's letter resembles the Sassanid 'Ahd Ardashir in its idiom and spirit, since both documents attack the masses and use the same derogative adjectives to depict them, ("8) and at the same time, both hope to buttress the spiritual position of the caliph or king. This assessment is convincing. To this exposition I would like to add two remarks on the differences between the documents. These discrepancies highlight the unique historical circumstances of the mihna. Despite their shared condescension, they viewed the masses quite diffe- rently. Whereas the 'Ahd Ardashir sees in them a threatening competitor, al- Ma'miin perceives them as intellectual incompetents who could not threaten (47) Al-Tabari, II, 1112-1113; tr. Bosworth, 200-201 (48) F. Steppat, "From 'Ahd Ardashir to Al-Ma'm6in: A Persian Element in the Policy of the Mihna," in ed. W. al-Qadi, Studia Arabica and Islamica (Beirut: Imprimerie Catholique, 1981), 454. 105</page><page sequence="14">NIMROD HURVITZ the intellectual elite. According to the citations that appear in Steppat's article, the king was advised to prevent a situation in which "the lowly people (al-sifla) will get ahead of you in studying and reciting religion..."("9) This remark assumes that the masses have the intellectual ability to gain knowledge, compete with the political rulers and even surpass them. This is not how al-Ma'muin thinks about the 'amma. When he writes that the masses do not have a "faculty of reasoning," he is implying that they would never be able to acquire the skills and knowledge of the intellectual elite and the- refore could not "get ahead" of them. The caliph and elite in al-Ma' muin's vision take a genuine interest in intel- lectual activities, and it is their mastery in these fields of knowledge that sets them apart from the masses. By contrast, the king, according to Steppat's quotes, is hardly more than a manipulative politician for whom intellectual and spiritual matters are means for maintaining control over the masses. Whereas faith is perceived in the 'Ahd Ardashir as a piece on a political game board that serves the kings interests, for al-Ma'min and like minded mutakallimfin, true faith is not something to be manipulated but rather a des- tination to be reached and a reason to battle religious opponents. From al- Ma'mfin's perspective the main purpose of the mihna was to enable the intellectual elite to pursue its theological investigations. If proclamations about the caliphs' spiritual authority advance this purpose then they ought to be made. However in contrast to the 'Ahd Ardashir, the caliph's authority is a means and not an end. A second point of variance between the two documents is their portrayals of oppressors and oppressed. In the 'Ahd Ardashir, it is the king who is des- cribed as having "offended, treated harshly, deprived, intimidated and humi- liated," the masses. (50) However, in al-Ma' mun's letter these power relations are turned upside down. One of the blurred, yet telling aspects of al- Ma'min's letter is a reference to the subjection of his intellectual partners to terror (al-hd'il). It suggests that the self-view of the mithna's instigators and administrators was that of victims. Thus, whereas the 'Ahd Ardashir deals with the potential strategies of a tyrant king that wishes to contain the revolts of the masses, al-Ma'mfin's letter promotes the cause of an oppressed intel- lectual elite that hopes to overcome their religious opponents. Like al-Jihiz, al-Ma'min criticizes the '"amma and their leadership vehe- mently, but does not specify who they are. Throughout his letter he uses degrading remarks to describe the 'dmma, but does not use names of parti- cular movements that operated in that period. If we wish to link the 'amma to a concrete historical entity, we need to extrapolate from the few clues that he offers in the letter. A hint of who al-Ma'min has in mind when he uses the term 'amma is his remark about their leaders: "[T]hey consider themselves adherents of the (49) Ibid., 451. (50) Ibid., 452. 106</page><page sequence="15">MIHNA AS SELF-DEFENSE sunnah." (5") In the opening decades of the third century A.H., the "adherents of the sunnah" are most probably the Traditionists (muhaddithan). These are religious scholars who dedicated enormous energies to collecting, classi- fying and criticizing Prophetic sayings and deeds, which by that time were known as the sunna. However, al-Ma'min does not merely refer to these scholars as "adherents of the sunnah." Rather, he asserts that this was only their self-image ("they consider [emphasis, N.H.] themselves") suggesting that it was a masquerade and that he did not view them as the upholders of the prophetic path. Another indication that the mihna was aimed against the muhaddithfin is the list of its interogees. Al-Tabari has mentioned the names of several dozen scholars who were interrogated by the governor of Baghdad. The most famous names in that list were renown scholars of hadith. In his study of these names J. A. Nawas observed: "Unambiguously, then, the findings tell us that the interrogees were muhaddithun of distinction, men highly esteemed for their intellect, as well as their social status and influence." (52) Although the letter does not specify that the 'amma are the muhaddithan, the names of the interogees reveal this to be the case. Through the mihna letters and these lists we learn that al-Ma'mun instigated the mihna in order to limit, and even eradicate if possible, the influence of the muthaddithun. Assuming that the 'amma are the Traditionists, who are the khassa? Al- Ma'mun describes them vaguely as "the people of God's own religion."(53) However, this description is not very helpful because it is not specific. All movements of that era would claim such a description for themselves. The best way to figure out who these "people of God's own religion" are, is to extrapolate from opposites. Since al-Ma'min characterizes the 'dmma as incapable of holding theological investigations it stands to reason that "the people of God's own religion" are individuals who are capable of arriving at true faith through theological inquiries. The connection between the ability to participate in theological investigations and the affiliation in "the people of God's own religion" and true religion is addressed by al-Ma'min in ano- ther remark that appears in the letter: "For there can be no good works except after sure faith, and no sure faith except after fully apprehending the true nature of Islam..."(4) In contrast to Traditionist views of religiosity which assume that it is enough for a Muslim to fulfill all the commandments of Islam, al-Ma'min assumed that faith depends on comprehension, and comprehension is derived from theological inquiry. It would thus appear that al-Ma' mfn considered the khcssa those "people of God's own religion" who were adroit in theology. (51) Al-Tabari, 1I, 1114; tr. Bosworth, 201. (52) J.A.

Bosworth, 202. 107</page><page sequence="16">NIMROD HURVITZ In al-Ma' min's letter, as in al-Jhiz's Risala, the 'amma and their leaders have shattered the proper spiritual order. Their intellectual ineptitude and ignorance of true faith has led them to depose the mutakallimtn from their rightful position of spiritual guides of the community and to place the muhaddithin in their place. Worse, they place themselves in the position from which they decide who is a true believer and who is not. As a conse- quence they do not merely ascribe to the muhaddithi~n the undeserved posi- tion of spiritual guides of the community, they also assign them the position of religious censors. "They [self-styled 'adherents of the sunnah,' N.H.]" writes al-Ma'mfin "go on to make an outward show of being people of the divine truth, the [real] religion and the community of the Muslims, and assert that all other are people of false beliefs, infidelity and schism." (55) The 'dmma were not only oblivious to their low status in the spiritual hierarchy, they had the audacity to accuse the mutakallimun of "false belief, infidelity and schism," hence question the mutakallimun's status as believers. In so doing, they took it upon themselves to draw the boundaries of the Islamic community, leaving the mutakallimtn outside. The 'admma's attitude towards the mutakallimun troubled al-Ma'mfin pro- foundly. In one of his caustic comments about them he accuses them of being the "tongue of Iblis, who speaks through his companions and strikes terror [al-ha'il 'ald, N.H.] into the hearts of his adversaries..."(56) From al- Ma'mfin's vantage point the Islamic masses did not understand anything about theology, did not recognize their guides in this field of religiosity, and actually turned against their potential religious saviors. The allegations that were made by al-Ma'mun about an atmosphere of terror, reveals that he thought that the muhaddithan and 'amma introduced scare tactics in the place of debate. According to al-Ma'muin's descriptions the Muslim com- munity was in a state of inter-factional struggles during the decades that pre- ceded the mihna. In addressing the 'dmma's acts of terror in the first mihna letter, al-Ma'muin indicates that he saw these struggles as bearing directly upon his decision to initiate the mihna. For al-Ma'mun, one of the most disturbing aspects of the muhaddithuin' s scare tactics, was their effectiveness. As he watched the ascendance of the muhaddithan, to whom the masses turned for their spiritual guidance, and whose testimony the misled 'dmma took to be true, al-Ma'min could not but realize that the social and spiritual standing of the mutakalliman was on the decline. Since the animosities between the muhaddithin and mutakallimiin ran so high, it was a zero-sum game. Placing the muhaddithan in the posi- tion of the spiritual leadership of the masses meant ostracizing the mutakal- limfin and expelling them from the community. Al-Ma' mn' s remarks in his letter of initiation about the muhaddithan's campaign against the mutakal- (55) Ibid. (56) Ibid., 1115; tr. Bosworth, 203. 108</page><page sequence="17">MIHNA AS SELF-DEFENSE limun and their efforts to place the latter outside the bounds of the commu- nity suggest that the miihna was meant to reverse this situation. The main goal of al-Ma'mu-n's milhna policy was to halt and reverse the deterioration in the spiritual status of the mutakallimin. To him, it was a world turned upside down. This state of affairs bothered him so much that he decided to divert from the traditional 'Abbasid policy of caliphal neutra- lity and place the court's authority behind the persecuted mutakallimin so as to reinstate them to their rightful positions of spiritual leadership. Conclusion Mutakallimun writings about the mihna evince a chronological depth and social breadth that are not found in Hanbali-Sunni, nor modem, accounts. One of their strengths is the way they dealt with the mihna's background, in which they assumed and depicted an ongoing struggle that probably went back several decades before 218 A.H., the year the mihna was initiated. It is precisely their view of the larger picture, and the manner that they integrate the mihna into the general flow of events, that makes their perspective appealing and important. One of the claims that the mutakallimiun made in both of the documents that were examined in this study, was that they were victims of persecutions. This was not self-righteous propaganda. When al-Ma'muin wrote of terror and al-Jahiz of intimidation, they expressed an authentic sentiment of the mutakallimun milieu. They were convinced that the mihna was a reaction to previous attacks that were aimed at them. In a nutshell, from the mutakal- limun point of view, the mihna was an act of self-defense. During the most part of the fifteen years that it lasted some of them may have thought that it was a successful step. According to al-Jhiz who wrote during the mihna, the new policy ushered in new relations between the muta- kallimin and muhaddithutn. It led to the cessation of the persecution of the mutakallimun as new venues of dialogue were established. Al-Jahiz's wri- tings also indicate that after the mihna, the mutakalliman aspired to move to the position they thought fit for them - the spiritual guides of the Muslim community. However, this proved to be a difficult task because the masses were not receptive to their ideas. It may be that al-Ma'miin and al-Jahiz wrote about the mutakallimun's sufferings in order to justify the new policy in which the muhaddithiin were persecuted. However, I don't think that their historical observations can be brushed off as mere propaganda. Though the two authors may have over- dramatized the events, their descriptions reflect their candid views of the mihna and its history. Instead of disregarding their accounts, it would be best to try to understand what was the concrete phenomenon that moved them to write in such harsh language against the muhaddithun. 109</page><page sequence="18">NIMROD HURVI17Z If we take their remarks seriously, we stand to derive a better understan- ding of the informal mechanisms by which contesting groups acquired power and kept their opponents on the margins of the community during the early stages of Islamic history. This issue has come up in the work of D. Ste- wart who writes that "Sunni jurists have historically attempted to restrict the boundaries of Islamic religious discourse and to prevent minority groups, including Mu'tazilites, Shi'ites and Kharijis, from participation in the deve- lopment of Islamic law." (7) Stewart, I believe, correctly points to the Sun- ni's attempts to exclude varying sects and theological trends from taking part in the formulation of Islamic law. To this I would also add that earlier on, in the pre-mihna era, proto-Sunni muhaddithun anticipate this attitude and conduct. It seems to me that the attempts of the Sunnis and their pre- cursors to keep members of other intellectual trends out of the "religious dis- course" is the very phenomenon that al-Ma' min and al-Jdlhiz refer to in their remarks about terror and intimidation. C. Melchert has described the stages in which the Mu'tazilites, Shi'ites, Kharijis and other adherents of kaldm, lost their standing in the milieu of hadith transmitters. (58) His findings indicate that in the first decades of the third century A.H., precisely before the mihna was initiated, the number of Qadari, Shi'i and other sectarian transmitters of hadith dropped signifi- cantly. (5) It is plausible that their numbers decreased as a result of the scare tactics to which they were subjected in those decades. In one of his obser- vations Melchert remarks: "The number of sectaries remains a roughly constant proportion of all transmitters until the ninth generation (beginning of the third century), or about the time when rijdl literature began to be com- posed." (60) This is a significant comment because it points to the early third century as the moment in which sectarian transmission of hadith decreased drastically and because it links the change in the sectarians' status with the development of rijdl literature. These remarks about rijdl literature and the decrease in the numbers of sectarian transmitters of hadith are helpful if we want to understand why the mutakallimi~n feared the muhaddithun and why they supported the mihna. Rijdl literature deals with the professional and ideological reputations of hadith transmitters. It is the written residue of a very important and wides- pread oral activity - the spread of rumors that made or broke careers of hadith transmitters. The constant exchange of opinions about scholars' inte- grity and professionalism determined their position within the community of (57) D.

When al-Jdhiz writes that the muhaddithin refused to sit and talk with the mutakallimun (before this changed during the mihna) he was writing about such rumors and their social repercussions, the echoes of which we read in rijal literature. The enigmatic remarks that were made by al-J.hiz and al-Ma'm-in about the campaigns that were waged against the mutakallimun, most likely refer to the negative professional assessments, slander and rumors spread by the muhaddithan. If this is the case, their comments are not merely a crucial component in any narrative of the mihna. They also bring into relief one of the most important weapons that were at the disposal of Sunni scholars, namely their ability to squeeze out opposition and forge the community's values. (61) Although we need to learn more about the power of rumors, slan- der and the professional assessments of muhaddithan, the comments by al- J.hiz and al-Ma'miin about the community's informal mechanisms of sup- pression is the most meaningful historical observation that the mutakallimfin narrative offers its readers.
