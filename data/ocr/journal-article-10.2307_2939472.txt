<plain_text><page sequence="1">VoLT XX., No. 18 AUGUST 30, 1923 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ON THE LOGIC OF FICTION rHE traditional Aristotelian logic is essentially the logic of classes 1 of existences or facts. While the fundamental principles of this logic can never, I believe, be shown to be false-and in that sense there can not be a strictly non-Aristotelian logic-it has in modern tumes been shown to be of limited applicability. In the first place, being inspired by classificatory zoology as the ideal science, it can not come as close to the actual methods of the mathematical and dynamic sciences as does the more modern logic of De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, Peano, Frege, Russell and Whitehead. To attain the results of the latter by syllogistic methods would be, if not impossible, so cum- brous as to be devoid of any utility. In the second place, the Aristote- lian logic, being fundamentally based on the supremacy of individual or particular existence, inevitably tends to belittle the metaphysical status of universals, relations, or processes. This tends to create an initial positivistic bias against mathematical or theoretic science, and against normative sciences such as ethics or esthetics. For these sciences deal primarily not with existing things or facts, but with laws or ideals of what must or should be, and they could have no right to the claim of being sciences, if it were true that logically organized science can deal only with what factually is. However, as it is undoubtedly true that all sciences depend on theoretic or mathematical methods, and that all judgments on human relations involve the normative standpoint of valuation, it becomes clear that the logic of existences depends upon the logic of validity. Moreover, since all developed sciences depend upon the process of comparing the consequences of rival hypotheses, it follows that correct or valid consequences can also be drawn from false hypotheses. The realm of valid logical inference is, therefore, wider than the realm of fact- ual existence. The logic of fiction belongs to this realm of non-fact- ual logic. Aristotle himself in a famous passage in his Poetics clearly re- jected the positivistic implication of his logic, by asserting that poetry is truer and more earnest than history (or factual investigation). This dictum, which is generally felt to contain a profound truth, can not be justified on the Aristotelian logic which dlivid1es all proposi- 477</page><page sequence="2">478 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tions so sharply into the existentially true and false as to leave no room for poetry or fiction except in the realm of the false. In the attempt to explore the realm of non-factual validity, it is hoped that the truth of this famous dictum will become clearer. I. THE LOGIC OF METAPHORS-FIGURATIVE TRUTH To appreciate the intellectual or scientific function of metaphors the reader had better begin with an experiment. Let him pick out a page or two of philosophic prose in any classical treatise or modern discussion. Let him -read this extract carefully and mark the number of passages in which the meaning is suggested metaphorically rather than literally. Let him then read the passage a second time and reflect how many of the passages first taken as literal truths are really metaphors to which we have become accustomed. I mean such expressions as "the root of the problem," 'the progress of thought," "the higher life," "falling into error," "mental gymnastics," and the like. Indeed, whenever we speak of the mind' doing anything, collecting its data, perceiving the external world, and the like, we are using the metaphor of reification, just as we use the metaphor of personification whenever we speak of bodies attracting and re- pelling each other. The third stage of the experiment is to try to rewrite the passage in strictly literal terms without any metaphors at all. I believe that the result of such experiment will confirm the conclusion that to eliminate all metaphors is impossible. This is especially clear when we try to express general considerations of a novel or unfamiliar character. For, how can we apprehend new re- lations except by viewing them under old categories? At any rate, the experiment will make more plausible the view that metaphors are not merely artificial devices for making discourse more vivid and poetical, but are also necessary means for the apprehension and communication of new ideas. This is confirmed by the history of language and of early poetry as well as by the general results of modern psychology. The prevailing view since Aristotle's Rhetoric regards every meta- phor as an analogy in which the words of comparison, like or as, etc. are omitted. This presupposes that the recognition of the literal truth precedes the metaphor, which is thus always a conscious trans- ference of the properties of one thing to another. But history shows that metaphors are generally older than expressed analogies. If intelligence grows from the vague and confused to the more definite by the process of discrimination, we may well expect that the motion common to animate and inanimate beings should impress us even before we have made a clear distinction between these two kinds of</page><page sequence="3">ON THE LOGIC OF FICTION 479 being. Thus it is not necessary to suppose that the child that kicks the chair against which it has stumbled personifies the chair by a process of analogy. The reaction is clearly one arising on the un- differentiated level. Metaphors may thus be viewed as expressing the vague and con- fused but primal perception of identity which subsequent processes of discrimination transform into a conscious and expressed analogy between different things, and which further reflection transforms into the clear assertion of an identity or common element (or rela- tion) which the two different things possess. This helps us to explain the proper function of metaphors in science as well as in religion and art, and cautions us against fallacious arguments for or against views expressed in metaphorical language. (a) The Funtction of Metaphors in Science.-If it is true that first perceptions of the new in experience tend to assume metaphoric expression, metaphors must play a large part in opening up new fields of science. That this is actually the case a few examples will indicate: (1) In the science of electricity the motion of an electric fluid was really never more than a metaphor. But it suggested many fruitful analogies, such as differences of level, direction of flow, etc. Farady's suggestion of lines or tubes of force may have been taken by many in a more or less literal sense, but the present electron theory shows that it was a metaphor, justified in its day by the fruit- ful analogies to which it led. (2) In psychology the metaphor of "states of mind" led to anal- ogies such as the association of ideas, which laid the beginning of modern psychology. James' metaphor of "stream of consciousness" has led to an emphasis on the more continuous aspects of mental life. 'His analogy between habit and the way paper creased on a given line will always fold more readily on that line, illustrates the power as well as the snares of metaphoric illumination in science. (3) In metaphysics the idea that the world is a machine working according to mechanical laws, or that it is an organism developing according to a fixed plan, is clearly metaphoric. So is the analysis of everything into substance and inherent qualities, analogous to a man and his possessions or clothes. It is well known that the cate- gories of cause, force, law, are anthropomorphic in origin and were thus originally metaphors. (b) Practical Value of Metaphors.-The fact that metaphors ex- press the primal perception of things with something of its un- differentiated atmosphere gives these metaphors an emotional power which more elaborate and accurate statements do not have. This is perhaps best seen in the profoundly simple metaphors of the New</page><page sequence="4">480 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Testament. "Feed my sheep" is more potent than "teach my doctrine" because it carries with it the atmosphere of suggestion which those genuinely moved to preaching feel before they can form- ulate it,-the tender sympathy to the helpless, the distress of the spiritually hungry, shown especially in the tense, open-mouthed faces of an oriental audience, etc. The same is true of the similes "sowing the seed of truth," or St. Paul's metaphor of preaching as "edification," of the righteous life as "girding on the armor of light," "garrisoning or fortifying the heart." Goethe's metaphor "Gray is all theory" is a vivid expression of what it would require considerable reflection to formulate in purely literal terms. So in practical affairs, the personifying of cities or nations, the likening of the state to a ship ("don't rock the boat"), or of changes of attitude to "the swing of the pendulum," contains a potency which literal statements do not have. (c) Fallacies.-Various fallacies result from the inadequate reali- zation of the metaphoric character of many propositions. Locke's metaphor of the mind as a tabula rasa illustrates the general prin- ciple. It is obviously fallacious to argue against this, as some have done, that the mind is not a tabula nor rasa and that nothing literally makes impressions on the mind!, as a stylus on a wax tablet. If there is any respect in which the metaphor can be transformed into a true analogy all these arguments are futile. Obviously there are many such analogies: e.g., the greater vividness of first impressions, the greater receptivity of the original state, etc. But it is obvious, also, that this metaphor leads to many false analogies, e.g., the conception of the mind as purely passive or receptive in sensation, etc. Similar considerations hold with respect to such metaphors as social organism, social forces, the external world, etc. This point of view will prevent us from misunderstanding the influence of symbols, and from committing the fallacy involved in the ordinary contemptuous reference to fetishism. The Hebrews could not understand the psychology of Greek and Roman "idol" worshippers, simply because the Greek idols were not to the Hebrews familiar symbols carrying with them vital penumbras of meaning. The Hebrews themselves, of course, had their own symbolic objects, the stones in the ark of the convenant, the scroll of the law (in later times), etc. That a sharp distinction between any symbolic object and that which it symbolizes is not primary, is made clear by a re- cent debate in our own House of Representatives. Upon being pressed as to his attitude to the country's flag, the Socialist Congress- man replied that he regarded the flag as but the symbol of the life of the people and that he respected the people, etc. The distinction was</page><page sequence="5">ON THE LOGIC OF FICTION 481 entirely too subtle for a democratic congressman from Texas, who kept on pressing Congressman London as to his attitude to the flag itself. II. CEREMONIAL EXPRESSIONS (a) Literal and Conventional Meanings.-Though it can not be denied that every proposition is either true or false, a great many fallacies result if we ignore the actual conventional meaning. Thus medimeval poetry is full of allusions to the fragrance of the daisy. But it would be erroneous to argue that Chaucer did not know that actual daisies have no scent. The expression is conventional, like "my dear sir," or "your humble servant uzll meet you on the field of honor." It is well known that just as men and women will not wear the same clothes on radically different occasions, they will not use the same modes of expression. We do not use precisely the same lan- guage in public address as in private conversation, in writing as in speech, in poetry as in prose. This is generally recognized, but its logical significance has not been sufficiently attended to. Thus the common courtesy which refers to persons and groups by the char- acteristics which they would like or ought to have, is fruitful of much intellectual- confusion. Many, for example, have built elabo- rate arguments on the assumption that Christian nations are monog- amous and that Mohammedans are polygamous, though it is ex- tremely doubtful whether in point of fact there is any great actual difference other than the question of legal status. This is also true of the old arguments from the maxim that the king could do no wrong, or the modern ones that in a democratic country the law is the will of the people, that the law leaves every one free, that it protects the poor equally as well as the rich, etc. These statements are in a sense true, but are dubious on the ordinary factual level. Sometimes it is, of course, doubtful whether expressions are or are not intended to be taken literally, e.g., when the Japanese admiral attributes the victory to the virtue of the emperor, or when army bulletins attribute victories to "the will of God and the courage of our troops." (b) Euphemisms.-Ceremonial expressions are often attacked as conventional lies when they are intended not to deceive but to express the truth euphemistically. Courtesy or politeness demands the elimination not necessarily of the truth, but of certain unpleas- ant expressions that are for some reason or other taboo. This is readily explained by the fact that words have emotional effects on their own account. Thus it is permissible to refer to a female (or lady) dog, but bad taste to use the single-syllabled word. It is</page><page sequence="6">482 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY proper for the stage pirates in Peter Pan to refer to a future meet- ing "below," but they would shock the audience if they used the more realistic and theologically canonical word. It is a similar de- sire to avoid the direct admission of a disagreeable truth, viz. that judges are not merely umpires but also make the law, that has led to the great host of legal fictions in the Anglo-American eommon law. It would be absurd to regard these fictions as false propositions. They are rather resolutions to extend certain legal rights. When the courts insist that the high seas are in the parish of Mary Le Bone in London, they do not mean to assert an absurd impossibility, but merely that they will take jurisdiction of acts occurring on the high seas precisely as if they had occurred in London; and in doing so they may be perfectly consistent. An adopted son is not a natural son, but he is entitled to the same rights. So with the fiction of the legal (not natural) personality of corporations. The confusions, however, between the literal and the conventional meaning have been a fruitful source of fallacious reasoning. III. ABSTRACTIONS IHegelians, positivists, and followers of James and Bergson are all united today in characterizing the abstract as unreal, and Vaih- inger classifies all abstractions as fictions or semi-fictions. In the face of so much unanimity in such diverse quarters it seems hazard- ous to put forth a simple denial. Let us, therefore, admit, as we all can, that abstractions are not real if the real is defined as that which is concrete and not abstract; but let us also insist on the factfor fact it seems to me in spite of the ideaphobia of Schopenhauer, James, and Bergson-that we do gain real knowledge by valid rea- soning about abstractions, that mathematical computation, for in- stance, does actually help to extend our knowledge of the factual world. We can insist on this while granting that there is a certain salte mortale between reasoning about abstractions and its applica- tion to any actual concrete situation. This salte mortale is perhaps the reason which makes modern enthusiasts characterize as fictional such a concept as " the economic man "' of Ricardo. Let us admit that no man has as yet ever acted from purely economic motives. This, however, in no way denies the force of Ricardo's reasoning or makes his deductions inapplicable to actual economic phenomena. The assertion that men are not actuated solely by economic motives does not deny that economic motives do exist and that while we can not completely isolate them in fact, we can compute their consequences, just as we can compute that certain physical consequences will happen to a man solely be-</page><page sequence="7">ON THE LOGIC OF FICTION 483 cause of his weight, or to certain substances solely because of their electric or thermal properties. The distrust of abstract reasoning thus rests upon two grounds (1) the chasm between what might be called the realms of mathe- matics and history, or of logical validity and brute existence, and (2) upon the dogma that every proposition asserts the inherence of a quality in a substance, or of an attribute in an existing subject. (1) All reasoning about abstractions takes the form of a universal proposition which can be put either into the hypothetical form or as a categoric assertion of the necessary or invariant connection between two elements. Now, as Hume and Kant have insisted, no number of historic instances can establish a universal or invariant relation. The existence of such invariant relations in the various sciences is an hypothesis, not proved a priori as Kant thought, but verified by the course of experience. Now, whenever we apply a theorem concerning an abstract entity, say a geometric sphere, to an actual body such as the earth or the sun, we make the satte mortale of equating an abstract and a concrete entity (in the pro- position: this is a sphere). Such a proposition can never be ab- solutely free from error; but the actual discovery of divergences never can throw doubt upon our abstract theorems, because we can explain the discrepancy by additional hypotheses, and the history of human science has shown this method to be the most reliable of all human instruments. From this point of view abstractions may be viewed as methodologic resolutions, or determinations to look at objects in certain ways. But this must not be interpreted in any subjective manner. To be scientific we must carry out our resolutions consistently and the laws of consistency are not arbitrarily made by our fiat, but are imposed upon us by the world in which we live, or the world which we study. (2) The second reason why abstractions, which are parts or phases of the real world, are regarded as unreal is due to the Aristotelian assumption that every proposition asserts the inherence of the predicate in the subject and that the ultimately real subject is an individual. From these two propositions we can get either a brute pluralism-a Leibnitzian world of many individuals, but as no one can be a predicate of another there can be no real con- nection between them-or an ineffable monism of the Bradleyan type in which the ultimate or absolute subject forever eludes us. From this dilemma we escape through the modern relational view of the nature of a proposition - which metaphysically means that not things but a complex of things-in-relation is the subject-matter of science. From this point of view propositions about abstract re-</page><page sequence="8">484 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lations no more falsify reality than do propositions about particulars. All propositions are more or less elliptical-as we can see by an analysis of the nature of language and signs. If I say " Jones is a wise or good man," this is clearly not true without qualification. We mean wise in some things, for the most part, as human beings go, etc. The more logically conscientious we become, the more need for adding qualifications. But these qualifications need not always be expressed, because they are generally understood and need not be made explicit, or else they are not sufficiently important or relevant for the purpose of communication. Precisely similar con- siderations hold in regard to abstract assertions. The statement that heat expands objects is true only if we add " under the same pressure " and " provided we do not apply this to water between 320 and 380 F.," etc. The degree of completeness necessary de- pends upon the purpose and circumstances of the proposition as a communication. IV. CONSTRUCTION AND HYPOTHESES We have treated metaphors, ceremonial expressions, and ab- stractions under the head of fictions partly because they are gener- ally so called, and partly because they all illustrate the fallacies into which we fall if we press the rules of the traditional logic without taking certain precautions. These precautions may all be deduced from the rule that the truth of a proposition holds only in its proper universe of discourse (or type in Russell's logic). This rule holds, indeed, of all propositions. Metaphors, ceremonial expressions, and abstractions do not differ from ordinary proposi- tions in principle, since ordinary propositions are all more or less metaphorical, conventional, and abstract. There is, however, cur- rent a sharp distinction between fact and fiction -the former as something which we find, the latter as something that we create. In the last decade or so, especially since the publication of Vaihinger's Philosophie des Als Ob, there has been an increased general recognition of the importance of fiction as construction in science. But the subject has been beclouded by the monistic mania. By trying to show that everything is a mental construction, the dis- tinction between fact and fiction is really obliterated. It must be admitted that while the distinction between making and finding something is very sharp in the physical realm, it is by no means so clear in other fields. Did the Romans find or invent their legal system ? Did the Greeks find or invent geometric science ? We always speak of finding the solution to all sorts of problems and even great mechanical inventors testify that they find their in- ventions, that the sought-for device sometimes " flashes upon them,"</page><page sequence="9">ON THE LOGIC OF FICTION 485 and most often they " stumble upon it " while looking for some- thing else. It may be objected that the expressions just used are more or less metaphoric; but the fact is that whenever we apply to mental objects the categories that we usually and confidently ap- ply to physical objects, we necessarily resort to metaphors. A com- plete clarification of this point demands a re-examination of what is meant by applying the categories of identity, determination, and creation to mental objects. Reserving this re-examination for a future occasion, I shall here barely refer to some of the more super- ficial aspects of scientific construction that seem to have no counter- part in the real world and are generally regarded as fictional. Vaihinger divides all fictions into genuine fictions which involve self-contradiction, and semi-fictions which are constructions not in agreement with reality or fact. With amazing industry he has gathered a most imposing list of what he calls genuine fictions. Nevertheless, there ought to be no hesitation in flatly denying that any of them do involve self-contradiction. If they did, no fruitful consequences could be drawn from them and they would not have the explanatory power which makes them so useful in science. A careful examination of the actual examples he uses shows that in every case the claim of self-contradiction rests on positive misin- formation. A few examples will be sufficient. The typical fiction which Vaihinger and others most often cite is the so-called imaginary number, -/-I. As in ordinary algebra there are no numbers whose square can be negative, this is tri- umphantly adduced as a clear example of a useful device based on a logically impossible entity. Modern mathematics, however, has made it clear that /-i is no more imaginary or self-contradictory than 42, which is still called irrational, surd, or absurd. Starting with certain useful conventions as to pair of numbers -J -1 becomes a most useful clue to the properties of certain fields of forces, so that it is hard to imagine how Maxwell's modern electric theory could possibly have been developed without the previous work of Gauss and Hamilton on the functions of V/-i. Logically, similar considerations hold with regard to the argument that self-contra- diction inheres in the notion of infinite number or of infinitesimal magnitude. Modern mathematics has removed the basis for such arguments. One hears nowadays that the ether is a fiction which involves contradictory qualities. This, also, is simply not true. The ether is an hypothetical entity, the existence of which follows from certain assumptions such as the law of the conservation of energy. Some of its properties are undoubtedly very unusual, and modern electromagnetic theory makes most of the mechanical models or</page><page sequence="10">486 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY analogies of it useless. But it is not at all self-contradictory - certainly not when it is in any way a useful explanation. The reason which leads so many to regard entities like /-1 as fictional is that they can see no substantial counterpart to them in the objective world. But if we forego the Aristolelian prepossession and adopt the relational logic there is no difficulty in pointing to the exact place in the objective world where the V/-l is to be found. We only have to keep in mind that it is not a thing nor the property of a thing, but a relation or transformation of things. The diffi- culty of explaining how that which is a pure fiction can explain or serve as a clue to the processes of nature is a difficulty which only the exclusive substance-attribute logic has to face. There seems to me no difficulty in maintaining, if you wish, the copy- theory of truth provided you admit that the world contains, besides things and their qualities, also relations and processes between them, and that the fruitfulness of science consists precisely in not copying the qualities of things but in grouping and sym- bolizing those relations or processes which most frequently repeat themselves. That this view can actually be carried out -that we can show all the fictions or constructions of science to rest on a real basis to the extent that they are in any way useful as explanations-can be fully proved only by actually writing a new and complete logic of science. A most cursory survey of the field, however, is sufficient for the present purpose. To the extent that scientific fictions or constructions serve to explain anything, they logically serve as hypotheses. These hypoth- eses may relate to entities which are empirically discoverable, or to entities which are not directly discoverable. Ignoring the former hypotheses which are not generally regarded as fictional, we may subdivide the latter into hypotheses which seem to be con- trary to fact, and hypotheses which seem to be so neutral to the realm of fact that the existence of their subject-matter can never be directly shown or disproved. Of hypotheses which seem contrary to fact, the existence of per- fectly free bodies, or of frictionless steam engines, are the best ex- amples. Newton's free bodies, which are the subject of the first law of motion, can not have any existence because of the law of gravity which comes into operation as soon as there are two particles, and the existence of a frictionless steam engine would be contrary to all thermo-dynamic experience. Yet reasoning about free bodies and frictionless engines is the very foundation of mechanics and thermo-dynamics, and the reason for this is that the relations and</page><page sequence="11">ON THE LOGIC OF FICTION 487 processes denoted by freely-moving bodies, or by frictionless engines, are of the widest occurrence-only they do not occur in isolation, but always in conjunction with other elements. But this fact that they do not occur in isolation is no more an argument against their genuine existence, than the fact that fathers never occur except in families is an argument against the genuineness of their existence. In the ethical field an hypothesis contrary to fact generally takes the form " if everyone did likewise," etc. If a principle is at issue this is a valid argument even if it is impossible for every one to do likewise. From this point of view we need not admit that there is anything especially subjective about the ideal elements or cases which abound in science - I mean the perfect circles, absolute rigidity of matter, absolute or ideal justice, and entities of that sort. There is nothing to prevent ideal entities of this sort representing actual relations between things or, more frequently, complexes of things expressed in judgments. This enables us to dispose of those positivists, like Le'vy-Bruhl, A. Levi, Rolin, Tourtoulon, or G. G. Cox in this country, who deny the possibility of any normative science such as ethics. Science, they say, deals only with facts, ethics is an affair of individual opinion as to what is desirable. As, however, there is an obvious difference between enlightened and unenlightened judgment as to what is desirable, these positivists can retain their position only by distinguishing between the art and the science of morals. Science, they tell us, shows us the laws according to which happenings are concatenated. To pick one 's way amid these laws is an art or practi- cal wisdom. This, however, evades the real issue, which is whether the question of the consistency of certain ethical judgments is or is not a legitimate question of science. To call it an art is not to an- swer this question in the negative, since all science is, in a sense, an in- tellectual art, the art of building up a system of consistent judg- ments. Neutral hypotheses, those of which the subject-matter can never be directly proved or disproved, are very numerous in all sciences. Thus the old-fashioned books on economics would begin by imagining one or more people landed on a desert island, just as the older theories of law and politics begin with an imaginary social contract, or modern mathematical physicists ask you to imagine a creature in a one- or two-dimensional space. Reasoning from such imaginary constructions is, indeed, confusing because we do not form a very clear idea of what it is that we are asked to imagine. But there is nothing fallacious in the method of such arguments. It is, as I</page><page sequence="12">488 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY have elsewhere tried to show, a great error to think that you can refute any of the older natural-law theories by denying that the social contract with which they began ever took place. The social contract is really not an hypothesis as to what actually happened, but a concept of social transformation. Concepts of this sort are like the auxiliary lines in a drawing or the parallels of latitude and longitude which we use in drawing maps. If one were to tell us that to draw a map of North America we should begin with drawing a certain triangle, then draw certain other lines, etc., it would be absurd to object that North America is not and never was a triangle. The triangle can, in truth, represent the relations between a point in Greenland, one in Alaska, and one at the Isthmus of Panama; and by beginning with these points the relation of others to them could be indicated in the manner directed. The map will never be a complete picture of North America, but it can be perfectly true on the scale indicated. Fictions, like maps and charts, are useful precisely because they do not copy the whole, but only the significant relations. These relations are identical in analogous cases; and we perceive and master the flux of phenomena only when we see running through it the threads of identity. MORRIS R. COHEN.
