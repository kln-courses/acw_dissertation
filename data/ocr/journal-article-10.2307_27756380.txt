Bond and Amy K. Stockman Department of Biology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina 27858, USA; E-mail: bondja@ecu.edu (J.E.B.) Abstract.?Here we present an objective, repeatable approach to delineating species when populations are divergent and highly structured geographically using the Californian trapdoor spider species complex Aptostichus atomarius Simon as a model system. This system is particularly difficult because under strict criteria of geographical concordance coupled with estimates of genetic divergence, an unrealistic number of population lineages would qualify as species (20 to 60). Our novel phylogeographic approach, which is generally applicable but particularly relevant to highly structured systems, uses genealogical exclusivity to establish a topological framework to examine lineages for genetic and ecological exchangeability in an effort to delimit cohesion species. Both qualitative assessments of habitat and niche-based distribution modeling are employed to evaluate selective regime and ecological interchangeability among genetic lineages; adaptive divergence among populations is weighted more heavily than simple geographical concordance. Based on these analyses we conclude that five cohesion species should be recognized, three of which are new to science. [Aptostichus stephencolberti; Cohesion species; dna barcoding; ecological interchangeability; Mygalomorphae; niche-based distribution modeling; species delineation.] Although it is generally accepted that species comprise lineages (De Queiroz, 1999, Sites and Marshall, 2004), how lineages are diagnosed or recognized as species remains a strong point of contention (Wake, 2006). It is this point of contention that has captured the inter est, thought, and imagination of many practicing sys tematists and evolutionary biologists because species constructs, by definition, convey an almost immeasur able number of questions and hypotheses?Are pop ulations isolated reproductively? Are they ecologically interchangeable? Does migration occur and at what fre quency? Are lineages genealogically exclusive (what genes or subset of genes are exclusive)? Does introgres sion occur when populations come into contact? De spite the complexity of questions raised by virtually any species construct, many of them lack the requisite rigor they seemingly imply. For example, many species hy potheses are based on a single character system (e.g., genitalia) or single class of characteristics (somatic mor phology) and are sometimes based on very few individ ual specimens (in some cases only one; see Huber, 2003, for a summary of spider examples). Delimiting species that represent real evolutionary lineages that summarize a set of well-founded hypotheses requires an integrative approach that accounts for multiple lines of evidence, if informed decisions regarding conservation of habitat and populations are to be made, and if we are to study speciation pattern, diversification, and process in a rig orous manner. Highly structured, genetically divergent, yet morpho logically homogenous species (e.g., nonvagile cryptic species), although often ignored or overlooked, pro vide one of the greatest challenges to delimiting species (e.g., Bond et al., 2001; Hedin and Wood, 2002; Sinclair et al., 2004; Boyer et al., 2007). Populations, or very small groups of populations, constitute divergent genetic lin eages but present somewhat of a contradiction because they lack the "requisite" characteristics often used when delimiting species. Morphological approaches to species delimitation in many of these groups grossly oversim plify and underestimate diversity (Bond et al., 2001; Bick ford et al., 2006); in short, these traditional applications fail if our interests extend beyond what can simply be diagnosed with a visual and/or anthropomorphic-based assessment. When genetically divergent, morphologically equiv alent lineages exhibit microallopatric population struc turing, lineage-based approaches to delineating species are further confounded; virtually all population groups are independent lineages and, thus, qualify as species (Agapow et al., 2004; Hickerson et al., 2006), likely yield ing specious results. For example, independent networks (constructed using statistical parsimony, TCS; Temple ton et al., 1987, 1992) are often considered a priori as putative species available for further delimitation?for example, 'The status of these independent networks as species was not questioned..." (Pons et al., 2006). Un der such a criterion, every population, and some haplo types, composing a highly structured taxon potentially fractionate into "putative species" (see Boyer et al., 2007). Further confounding the issue of species delimitation in nonvagile organisms are matters related to geographic sampling (Hedin and Wood, 2002) and that deep phylo geographic breaks can arise stochastically (Irwin, 2002). Although advocates of sequence-based species delimi tation argue that DNA-based taxonomy should rely on sequence information alone (e.g., Pons et al., 2006), or ganisms with highly structured systems, in particular, dictate an integrative approach to investigating species boundaries?approaches that, by design, must incorpo rate lines of evidence beyond simple molecular mark ers (Will et al., 2005) because population structuring and divergence may only represent a maximum point of di vergence; that is, populations may have diverged genet ically long before they would be recognized as species. Two major issues must be considered for this class of organismal group if an integrative approach to species delimitation is to be employed. First, how are lineages 628</page><page sequence="2">2008 BOND AND STOCKMAN?SPECIES DELIMITATION WITH EXTREME POPULATION STRUCTURING 629 delineated as "candidate" species; that is, how does one identify "basal" lineages ("the oldest split or splits within a species," sensu Wiens and Penkrot, 2002) in a highly structured, divergent system? And, second, once candi date lineages have been identified, what types of criteria are used to delimit them as species such that adaptive di versity and evolutionary potential (Crandall et al., 2000) are captured as part of the species recognition "pro cess"? Herein we outline an operational evolutionary lineage-based approach for delineating cohesion species (Templeton, 1989) for organismal groups that exhibit pronounced population genetic structure on a very fine geographical scale. For a set of populations to qualify as a cohesion species, they must be derived from a single evo lutionary lineage (i.e., they share common ancestry) and must be genetically exchangeable and/or ecologically inter changeable (Templeton, 2001). The cohesion species con cept is ideal in its general applicability across all types of taxa (Hull, 1997) and its ability to be couched as a set of testable null hypotheses (Templeton, 2001). Our approach, outlined below, employs an iterative method ology and set of rules to evaluate sister lineages for co hesion species criteria. We apply our approach to the Aptostichus atomarius trapdoor spider species complex, a group that is morpho logically homogenous and nonvagile. We first evaluate species crypsis among A. atomarius populations using morphometric techniques to rigorously test the null hy pothesis that these populations are morphologically ho mogenous for a set of traditionally used features (e.g., genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics). Second, we evaluate the genetic structuring of populations us ing a set of mitochondrial and nuclear markers; a recon ciled gene tree approach is used to identify basal lineages. Third, we evaluate these lineages using cohesion species criteria to test the null hypothesis that divergent lin eages comprise a single species. Genetic exchangeability (gene flow) is evaluated by assessing geographical con cordance (agreement between geography and exclusive haplotype groups) and evidence of allopatric fragmen tation. Ecological interchangeability (habitat or niche of a species) is evaluated using niche-based distribution modeling (Stockman and Bond, 2007) and by assess ing habitat differences through evaluation of adaptive divergence within a phylogeographic framework. Ge netically divergent lineages with parapatric geographic distributions that are ecologically interchangeable are re tained as a single species (sensu Crandall et al., 2000). This approach seeks to evaluate populations separated by many genetic changes such that species are not over split (Agapow et al, 2004), while balancing the reality that these population groups represent independent evo lutionary lineages. The Aptostichus atomarius Complex The Aptostichus atomarius (Araneae: Mygalomorphae, Cyrtaucheniidae) species complex is an assemblage of populations of trapdoor spider (Bond and Opell, 2002; Bond and Hedin, 2006) distributed throughout southern California and extending northward along the coastal counties into Del Norte County (Fig. 1). These fosso rial spiders are sit-and-wait predators that build silk lined burrows covered by silk-soil trapdoors. The genus Aptostichus is species rich, consisting of 30+ species (most undescribed) found predominantly throughout southern California, a recognized biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al., 2000; Schoenherr, 1992). Species diagnosis is based largely on male secondary sexual characteristics? morphological modifications of the first walking legs (see Fig. 1), typically referred to as the "mating clasper." Like many other mygalomorphs (tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and their kin), Aptostichus life-history charac teristics manifestly differ from other spiders (Bond et al., 2006): they are long lived (15 to 30 years), requiring 5 or more years to reach maturity (Main, 1978), and are sedentary. Many mygalomorphs do not balloon?a com mon dispersal mode where spiders use silk draglines to capture air currents. As a consequence, mygalomorphs are prone to extreme population structuring (see Bond et al., 2001, 2006; Starrett and Hedin, 2007; Arnedo and Ferr?ndez, 2007). Based on a qualitative assessment of male mating clasper morphology, all known populations of Ap tostichus atomarius have been treated as a single species (Bond, 1999); this diagnostic structure does not appear to differ significantly for any of the populations sur veyed (Fig. la). Variation among individuals collected at the same location is comparable to that for individu als from widely separated sites (^1500 specimens exam ined; Bond, 1999). Materials and Methods Specimen Sampling and Vouchering We attempted to obtain &gt;3 specimens (following Wiens and Penkrot, 2002) per locality throughout the known distribution of Aptostichus atomarius (see on line appendix, available at www.systematicbiology.org). However, due to the cryptic nature of these spiders' bur rows and overall rarity at some sites (in such cases pur posely collecting fewer), some localities are represented by &lt;3 individuals. Each specimen was assigned a unique voucher number and haplotype designation; all speci mens collected as part of this study will be deposited in various museum collections (see online appendix). To establish the exclusivity of the focal taxon (Wiens and Penkrot, 2002), 11 additional species were sampled. Analyses of Mating Clasper and Spermathecae Shape Digital images of male mating claspers (Leg I, left side when possible) were recorded at the highest magnifica tion possible for all available specimens using a digital camera mounted on a stereomicroscope. Size calibra tions were assessed by photographing a stage microme ter (accuracy to 0.02 mm) at magnification. Spermathecae were removed from female specimens, cleared in clove oil, temporarily mounted on slides, and photographed using a compound microscope equipped with a digital</page><page sequence="3">630 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 57 b) Mating Claspers %y36*_sm #AP06C_SBO AP179.KRN.

Im ages were analyzed using the computer program Im agej (Rasband, 2007). Quantitative measurements taken from each mating clasper comprised tarsal, metatarsal, tibia, proximal/ventral metatarsal depression length, metatarsal apophysis height, and metatarsus width. Meristic measurements comprised spine counts from the following mating clasper articles/regions: distal prolat eral tibia, retrolateral tibia, and prolateral patella, tibia, and metatarsus. Spermathecal measurements comprised the following: total width at base, base height, length of bulb stalk, terminal bulb diameter, and separation of bulb and base. Male mating clasper metatarsus and tar sus lengths were scaled as ratios of tibia size. Metatarsal height was scaled to proximal metatarsal width and the metatarsal depression length was scaled as a ratio of total metatarsal length. Tibia length was retained in subsequent analysis as a general metric of size. Sper mathecal base height, stalk length, bulb diameter, and separation were all scaled as a ratio of the total spermath ecal width at the base. The total width at the base was retained as a general metric of spermathecae size. Princi pal component analysis (PCA) of 10 mating clasper and 5 spermathecae measurements (analyzed separately) were conducted using the computer program PC-ORD ver sion 4 (McCune and Mefford, 1999). DNA Preparation and Sequencing Legs were removed from each specimen and preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at -80?C; whole specimens were preserved in 80% ethanol. Ge nomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit. Standard PCR protocols were used to am plify an approximately 1500-base pair region of the mi tochondrial genome spanning the region coding for the 12S rRNA, val-tRNA, and 16S rRNA genes (partial frag ments of the 12S and 16S genes were amplified using the primers LR-J-12887 CCGCTCTGAACTCAGATCACGT and SR-N-14612spid AAGACAAGGATTAGATACCCT) for all specimens included in the study. The in ternal transcribed spacer (ITS) units 1 and 2 were amplified using the primers CAS18sFl TACACACCGC CCGTCGCTACTA and CAS28sBld TTCTTTTCCTCC SCTTAYTRATATGCTTAA and protocols as outlined in Ji et al. (2003) for a subset of taxa representing each of the major mitochondrial gene population groups (4 5/mtDNA clade). Mitochondrial PCR products were pu rified and sequenced with both amplification primers and an additional internal sequencing primer (LR-J 13XXXa GGCAAATGATTATGCTACC) using an ABI au tomated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). ITS products were purified and sequenced using the amplification primers. In an effort to detect any possible intraindividual variation, PCR products were cloned using the Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) Topo TA cloning kit; cloned products were amplified and se quenced using standard vector primers (Ml 3 forward and reverse, and T3 and T7, respectively). All sequences were edited using the computer program Sequencher (Genecodes, Madison, WI) and then aligned using the software package ClustalX vl.8 (Thompson et al., 1997) with the default gap opening and extension penalties. Minor adjustments were made to the alignment to cor rect obvious mistakes. Gaps were treated as missing in all likelihood analyses. Unambiguous insertion/deletions (indels) were scored as binary characters (ITS data only; Bayesian analyses). Phylogenetic-Based Analyses The computer program MrModelTest v2.1 (Nylander, 2004) was used to select an appropriate substitution model, by Akaike information criterion (AIC), for each data partition (12S, tRNA, 16S, and ITS). Using the model of substitution indicated by AIC, analyses employing Bayesian inference were conducted with MrBayes v3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003); the mtDNA and nu clear data sets were analyzed separately. Analyses con sisted of two simultaneous runs each consisting of four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains run initially for 1,000,000 generations. Separate, simultaneous runs were compared every 1000 to 5000 generations to check for convergence (standard deviation of split frequencies &lt;0.01); runs were extended as necessary. Estimated pa rameters for each molecular partition were set to be in dependent, using unlink statefreq (all), revmat = (all), shape = (all), pinvar = (all). MCMC runs were sum marized and investigated for convergence of parame ters, using the sump and sumt commands in MrBayes and the computer program Tracer v3.1 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2005). Trees prior to log likelihood stabiliza tion (burn-in) and convergence were discarded; a major ity rule consensus tree was produced using the contype = allcompat command. As a second measure of node support for major clade groupings, we conducted a nonparametric bootstrap analysis in PAUP* (Swofford, 2002) and Garli v0.951 (Zwickl, 2006) consisting of 100 replicates. Each run comprised 10 random addition sequence replicates us ing TBR branch swapping; swapping iterations were restricted to one million rearrangements. Gaps were treated as missing; binary-scored indels were given a weight of 2 (ITS data only). The character trace facility in Mesquite v2.0 (Mad dison and Maddison, 2007) was employed for ances tral character state reconstruction of spider habitat type and to measure discord between gene trees and popula tion subdivision (sof Slatkin and Maddison, 1989). Each mitochondrial DNA haplotype was assigned either the coastal dune or inland habitat character state designa tion. Character history on the Bayesian tree was then re constructed using maximum-likelihood with a Markov k-state 1-parameter model (Mkl, Lewis, 2001). Values for s were computed for each major clade recovered from the mtDNA Bayesian tree; we report s as the number of mi gration events required &gt; indicated by the tree structure alone (s reported = s ? (r?1); where r = the number of sampling locations).</page><page sequence="5">632_SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY_VOL. 57 A reconciled gene tree, based on the mitochondrial and nuclear genealogies, was constructed in Mesquite. The mitochondrial gene tree was pruned to include only those taxa for which there was ITS data. Searches for the reconciled gene tree, minimizing deep coalescences for the two trees (Maddison, 1997), consisted of a heuristic search using SPR branch swapping. Niche-Based Distribution Modeling Following Stockman and Bond (2007), ecological in terchangeability is evaluated using two primary means of assessment. First, locality coordinates for each speci men were imported into ArcMap (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and converted into shape files. We used seven environ mental layers thought to "likely influence the suitability of the environment" (Phillips et al., 2006) for A. atomar ius (see Stockman and Bond, 2007, for further justifica tion of layer choice). Five climatic layers were obtained from the WORLDCLIM data set (Hijmans et al., 2005): annual precipitation, annual maximum temperature, an nual minimum temperature, mean monthly temperature range, and mean precipitation during the driest quarter. A sixth layer, elevation, was constructed from a mosaic of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from the Na tional Elevation Dataset (USGS). DEMs were converted to Raster format in ArcMap and resampled from 30-m resolution to 1-km resolution using bilinear interpola tion. The seventh layer, California level III bioregion data, was obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, Fire and Resource Assessment Pro gram (CDF-FRAP) website and scaled to 1-km reso lution using nearest-neighbor interpolation. All seven layers were clipped to the same extent, cell size, and projection. Niche-based distribution models (DMs) were created using the computer program Maxent (Phillips et al., 2006). Maxent employs a maximum likelihood method that estimates a species' distribution that has maximum entropy subject to the constraint that the environmen tal variables for the predicted distribution must match the empirical average (Elith et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 2006). Parameters for all Maxent analyses used the de fault values: convergence threshold = 10~5, maximum iterations = 500, regularization multiplier = 1, and auto features selected. Additional larger values of the regu larization multiplier were used to ensure that models were not overfitting the data. Binary maps (predicted presence or absence) were created from the Maxent gen erated DMs using the lowest presence threshold value (LPT; see Pearson et al, 2006; Stockman and Bond, 2007). The LPT is determined by selecting the lowest predicted value for the set of presence points used to generate the DM. We then assessed degree and significance of overlap between DMs of closely related lineages using the proce dure outlined in Stockman and Bond (2007) that employs a Monte Carlo algorithm, implemented in the computer program D-NOVL vl.3 (Stockman et al., 2007), to gener ate the probability distribution of overlap amounts ex pected for observed DMs. The second assessment of ecological interchangeabil ity entails a principal components analysis of 19 climatic variables (WorldClim data set; Hijmans et al, 2001) eval uated for each clade being compared, followed by a MANOVA of the PC scores as outlined in Graham et al. (2004b) and Stockman and Bond (2007). Clades were treated as the fixed factor; PC scores were the depen dent variables. A significant MANOVA score indicates potential nonoverlap of ecological niche. Methodological Framework to Delimiting Cohesion Species As discussed by Wiens (2007), proportionally few pa pers address the development of explicit methodolo gies for delimiting species despite its importance as a fundamental goal of sy sterna tics. We outline here a methodological framework for delineating species. The approach we employ is easily formulated as a set of repeatable steps (outlined in Fig. 2). The initial crite ria are modeled after Wiens and Penkrot (2002). A ge nealogy is used to evaluate geographical concordance once exclusivity of the focal taxon has been established. If haplotypes are not geographically structured, then the possibilities of incomplete lineage sorting (if adap tive divergence is observed; sensu Masta and Maddison, 2002) or one widespread species with gene flow must be considered. We establish a basal lineage starting point for species evaluation through genealogical exclusivity shared among lineages identified via a second nuclear marker. This line can be established using alternative procedures (e.g., Pons et al., 2006; Stockman and Bond, 2007; Wiens and Penkrot, 2002) in cases where diver gence values do not preclude their application. This step evaluates "hypothesis 1" of the cohesion species concept (CSC)?Are the organisms sampled from a single evolu tionary lineage? The next step is to evaluate "hypothesis 2" of the CSC?Are the lineages genetically exchangeable and/or ecologically interchangeable? Exchangeability is as sessed as a sister group comparison of the daughter lineages (basal lineages) defined by the node directly below the basal lineage designation. Each basal lin eage sister pairing is first evaluated for the possibility of gene flow between clades?genetic exchangeability. Sampling must be sufficient to discriminate between disjunct distributions due to nonoverlap versus insuffi cient sampling. When unsampled areas separate clades, the strength of the phylogenetic break is reinforced by genetic divergence that is uncorrelated with the geo graphic distance separating the clades. Second, basal lineage pairings are evaluated for adaptive divergence potential?ecological interchangeability. Adaptive di vergence (AD) can be assessed by using standard ap proaches (e.g., morphological differentiation) or by other less conventional means (e.g., overlap of DMs as already discussed, see Graham et al., 2004a, 2004b, Wiens and Graham, 2005; Swenson, 2005; Jakob et al., 2007; Stock man and Bond, 2007; Rissler and Apodaca, 2007). Our ap proach does not require that both criteria (nongenetic and nonecological exchangeability) be met.

Alternatively, a deep phylo geographic break in the absence of AD requires concor dance across other data sets to rule out sampling artifact. Genetically structured population groups that lack sig nificant geographical breaks and AD are treated as a sin gle clade, or cohesion species. Alternatively, situations involving a significant geographic/habitat break but no AD are more ambiguous as such scenarios may be inter preted as speciation with niche conservation. Basal lineages determined not to be genetically ex changeable or ecologically interchangeable are rejected as cohesion species and are essentially designated as emergent focal taxa (bottom of Fig. 2). The daughter lin eages of the basal lineage nodes are evaluated in the same manner as described above. Based on the de gree of structuring and divergence in the nascent fo cal taxon, the newly established "basal lineage" may be evaluated using finer scale approaches (e.g., coalescent modeling/simulations if divergence values are shallow enough) if applicable. Evaluation progresses through the tree examining the daughters of each node towards the tips until the null hypotheses of genetic exchangeability and/or ecological interchangeability cannot be rejected using the criteria outlined in Figure 2. Finally, it is im portant to note that character optimizations of putative adaptive divergence may identify lineages towards the tips of the tree that qualify as recent speciation events via AD. Any such demarcation will render previous de lineations in a focal taxon paraphyletic; otherwise, AD would have been detected as a basal dichotomy in a pre vious step. Results Analyses of Mating Clasper and Spermathecae Shape Figure lb summarizes the results of the principal com ponent analyses (color coded by geographic region). The first three axes of the PCA of mating clasper dimen sions describe 89.34% of the variation. However, there appears to be no discrete groupings of populations based on these features even when plotted along three axes. The two individuals collected from populations along the coast (in green) appear to be separated somewhat from the remaining samples. It is, however, important to note that these samples are each respectively sepa rated along two different axes and thus do not techni cally fall out together as a distinct group. Results of the PCA of spermathecae shape are similar. The first three axes describe 95% of the variation, and no geographi cally distinct groups are observed along any of the three axes. Based on qualitative and quantitative evaluations of spider mating morphology we would conclude that A. atomarius comprises a single, widely distributed mor phological species. Phylogenetic Analyses Summary of genetic data.?Aligned matrices and trees are accessioned TreeBase (S2114). We sampled 167 in dividuals drawn from 75 sampling localities across the known distribution of Aptostichus atomarius; 140 unique mtDNA haplotypes (GenBank accession num bers EU569898 to EU570037) were recovered from the aligned data set comprising 1517 positions. Partial se quences (partial 16S) only were obtained for the Farallon Island and Pinnacles sampling localities. Pairwise diver gence values across the ingroup ranged from 0.007 to 0.239 (uncorrected P-values). With few exceptions (see discussion below), haplotypes were restricted to single localities, and multiple haplotypes sampled from the same locality formed exclusive clades in all but one case. Based on these results, we conclude that female gene flow is severely limited, as has been documented for other related mygalomorph groups (Bond et al., 2001, 2006, Bond, 2004; Starrett and Hedin, 2007). Internal transcribed spacer unit gene sequences (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) for 22 individuals from 22 localities were sampled (GenBank accession numbers EU569876 to EU69897). A "stratigraphic" approach to subsampling individuals for this data set was based on phylo genetic position within the mtDNA genealogy (see haplotypes labeled in red, Fig. 3). We aimed to obtain nuclear sequences for individuals corresponding to basal, intermediate, and derived positions within each mtDNA clade. All sequences recovered from the aligned data set comprising 905 base pairs were unique; 12 unambiguous indels were scored as binary characters. Pairwise divergence values ranged from 0.001 to 0.07 (uncorrected P-values). Phylogenetic analyses.?The AIC analysis performed in MrModelTest for the mitochondrial data indicated a gen eral time-reversible model with a gamma distribution and invariants model of rate heterogeneity (GTR+r+I) for the 16S and tRNA partitions; GTR+r was indicated for the 12S partition. Bayesian analysis of the data re quired 3 million generations to achieve convergence of the two simultaneous runs. The results of the analy sis, with outgroups removed, are summarized in Fig ure 3 (?In = 31,256.83, harmonic mean evaluated from both runs post-burn-in); branch lengths shown are av eraged across the posterior distribution. Results of this analysis have the following three key features relevant to subsequent consideration for species delimitation: (1) the focal taxon is genealogically exclusive with re spect to the outgroup taxa (GenBank accession numbers EU70038 to EU570050); (2) it exhibits extreme popula tion structuring that is strongly geographically concor dant across all phylogenetic levels (deep and shallow); and (3) the five basal-most clades are strongly supported (p &gt; 0.95). Migration among lineages within each of the major clades appears to be severely limited, with only a few instances of geographically proximate populations sharing haplotypes (clade 1, s = 1; clade 2, s = 1; clade 3, s = 0; clade 4, s = 1; clade 5, s = 0); no haplotypes are shared among the five clades.

For the nuclear ITS data, the AIC analysis indicated a general time-reversible model with a gamma dis tribution and invariants model of rate heterogeneity (SYM+r+I) for ITS1 and ITS2 and a Jukes-Cantor model (JC; Jukes and Cantor, 1969) for the 5.8S partition. An Mk+r model was used for the gap data partition. The Bayesian analysis of these data comprised 10 million gen erations; burn-in was conservatively set at 7.5 million generations. The results of the analysis are summarized in Figure 4a (?In = 2409.98, harmonic mean evaluated from runs post-burn-in); branch lengths are averaged across the posterior distribution. The ITS genealogy is largely congruent with that based on the mtDNA data. Five major groups are recovered in the unrooted tree topology. With the exception of clade 2, all groups are moderately to strongly supported in Bayesian, likeli hood, and parsimony analyses. Clade 2 is paraphyletic with respect to a couple of basal haplotypes; it is, how ever, monophyletic in a small percentage of the post burn-in trees. Figure 4b shows the reconciled species tree minimizing deep coalescence for the mtDNA and ITS gene trees. This tree is a strict consensus of 100 equally optimal trees (score = 11,152,168 rearrangements exam ined) recovered from the analysis and show that all five major clades are recovered but that clade 2 remains pa raphyletic with respect to a single haplotype. Maximum likelihood reconstruction of spider habitat type (coastal dune versus inland) optimizes the coastal character state as derived at two points on the tree (Fig. 3): Clade 2 (proportional likelihood (pi) = 0.98) and a subset of clade 5 (pi = 0.99). Clade 2 and the coastal subset of clade 5 are considered nonecologically interchangeable with their respective sister lineages as a consequence of this habitat shift (see Discussion). Niche-Based Distribution Modeling Figure 5 summarizes the DMs constructed for clades 3 to 5. Only the inland (noncoastal) populations were used to build predictive models for clade 5. As we will discuss below, coastal dune populations are considered to be a separate cohesion species.

The disjunct haplotype from Pinnacles (SBT01; see Fig. 6c) was omitted from the analysis as an outlier. The Salinas River Valley (Fig. 5a, dashed line) is consistently an area of low probability in all of the predicted distri butions and as such likely represents a historical barrier to gene flow (see Discussion). Two separate DMs were generated for the basal constituent lineages of clade 4, as models produced from these clades combined were prone to gross overprediction, likely due to the widely varying habitat across this clade's known distribution. The predicted distribution of clade 4B (Fig. 5c; LPT = 50%) is restricted to the mostly xeric western edge of the Central Valley; populations along this once more mesic transect (see Harden, 2004) are rare and likely relictual (Stockman and Bond, 2007). Conversely, predicted dis tribution of clade 4C (Fig. 5b; LPT = 34%) is found in the more mesic coastal habitats, confined mainly to the Gabilan and Diablo ranges just south of the San Fran cisco Bay. Areas of high probability for the inland occur rence of clade 5 (Fig. 5d, based on 14 data points; LPT = 40%) overlap almost the entire predicted range of clade</page><page sequence="11">638 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 57 FIGURE 6.

Based on the analysis in D-NOVL, the probability of observing this degree of overlap among randomly distributed ranges is &lt;0.001. The MANOVA of the first three PC scores of clades 4 and 5 is nonsignificant (F(3, 28) = 2.71, P &gt; 0.05), sug gesting, like the overlapping DMs, that these clades are ecologically interchangeable. The MANOVA comparing the PC scores of clade 3 and clade 4+5 is significant (F (3, 37) = 4.26, P &lt; 0.05), indicating noninterchangeability. Discussion Figure 6 shows the direct correspondence between the mtDNA haplotype trees and geographic localities. Al though the Aptostichus atomarius species complex lacks morphological variation in male secondary sexual char acteristics and in general female somatic morphology (Fig. 1), it is highly structured on a fine geographic scale (Fig. 6). Commonly employed, morphology-based ap proaches to species delimitation for trapdoor spiders would fail to recognize the deep evolutionary history in trinsic to this group. Conversely, congruence among both mitochondrial and nuclear loci recognize a number of di vergent basal lineages. However, this profound within lineage population structuring on a microallopatric scale creates a certain degree of difficultly when attempting to objectively determine a cutoff point for delineating lin eages for speciation or conservation status using other methods (e.g., Wiens and Penkrot, 2002). Haplotypes within some populations fail to unite at the 95% con fidence level using TCS; consequently, this methodology clearly over splits the group into an unreasonable num ber of species-level lineages (~60). If a criterion of geo graphical concordance is employed, more than 20 species would be recognized within the A. atomarius complex. Although this may be a rather simplified geographic concordance delineation, most of these lineages are ge ographically disjunct (Fig. 6) and could be empirically distinguished on the basis of unique nucleotide substi tutions; that is, they are diagnosable at the molecular level. Topology-based evaluation of cohesion species criteria.? Aptostichus atomarius is genealogically exclusive and structured geographically; the dashed gray line in Fig ure 7 depicts the five basal mtDNA lineages designated as prospective species. Table 1 summarizes species de lineation inferences for each clade (see Figs. 3 and 6). Evaluations of genetic exchangeability (Ge) and ecolog ical interchangeability (Ei) are first considered one node directly below the basal lineage designation (nodes A to C; Fig. 7). At node A, clades 1 and 2 are geographi cally disjunct (Fig. 1) such that Ge is unlikely given their separation; that is, total nonoverlap spatially (clade 2 is restricted to the coast; SI, Fig. 2). Because clade 2 is found only in coastal dune habitat, it has significant AD, and thus these lineages are also not ecologically inter changeable. Trapdoor spiders inhabiting coastal dunes construct deeper burrows with heavier silk linings (Bond personal observation), cope with a continually shifting sand substrate and salt-laden winds, encounter different prey items, and experience relatively mild, regulated cli matic conditions (Schoenherr, 1992; Ornduff et al., 2003). Also, these psammophilic forms differ phenotypically: their abdominal coloration and striping is much lighter than that of the inland forms (Fig. 3). The ecological distinction that can be made at node B, which forms the dichotomy established by clade 3 and clade 4+5, is not as straightforwardly resolved. These clades form a parapatric grade of populations/lineages extending from the coastal ranges inland and northward (Figs. 1, 6c to f). The potential for Ge would be diffi cult to dismiss in the absence of exhaustive geographic sampling. However, the geographic range of clade 3 ap pears to be discordant from that of clade 4+5 as a con sequence of the Salinas Valley, an ancient biogeographic break (Jacobs et al, 2004) that has been documented for several unrelated taxa (e.g., Shaffer et al., 2004; Matocq, 2002; Rissler et al. 2006; Starrett and Hedin, 2007). Al though the DM for clade 5 overlaps minimally with that of clade 3 (Fig. 5), the relatively low-lying area of the Salinas Valley is likely unsuitable given the low values of our predictive models for this region and failure to obtain any specimen from this area. Whereas evidence for non-Ei is questionable, the location of this phyloge netic break along an established geographic landmark, coupled with habitat unsuitability, supports delimitation at this point in the genealogy (Fig 2, S2). Conversely, as focus is shifted up to the sister pairing at node C, we "collapse" clades 4 and 5 down to node C because they overlap significantly in their predicted distributions (Fig. 4b to d) and are not associated with any documented clad?-1 t?tr clade-2 clade-5_ dade-3_ clade-4_ Tnr . l^l~?*-J^Z l i r 1 i?r= I i , i tiiiitHiiwii^HWHHHHiiiiiiiiHiiui^iniiiiiiiiiimim.lUiiiHiuilmiHitiiimiiiiimmwiini.nmminnijmit.??mu^iiiwii|fljfl^it?^^ ^ ^^ ii?mi ii m.^-n... ? ^m i-...i.

Inconclusive outcome: geographic sampling inadequate but Pinnacles Haplotype, 3A, isolated and 3B/C_ outside area of prediction for clade 3B/C_ phylogeographic breaks (Fig. 2, S3). Although we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the phylogenetic dis continuity at this node is not a sampling artifact (sensu Irwin, 2002; Kuo and Avise, 2005), this argument is weak ened somewhat by the exclusivity of this clade in the ITS genealogy (Fig. 4). Thus far, of the five major clades, clades 1 to 3 were retained above as nonexchangeable lineages (cohesion species). As such, these lineages should now be evalu ated for further delimitation (i.e., do these lineage contain &gt;1 species). This evaluation should proceed as before such that the basal dichotomy within each clade is exam ined for Ge and Ei. Essentially nodes E, F, and G are re set as emergent focal taxa. Clade 1 exemplifies sampling issues often encountered for highly structured popula tions. First, the two nodes at the basal-most dichotomy (node E) lack strong support (p &lt; 0.95; Figs. 3, 7). Sec ond, geographical sampling is sparse along the southern most extension of the Coast Ranges (Fig. 6a). Subclades within the weakly supported basal lineage (Fig. 6a CIA) are highly geographically discordant, with one subclade in the Mojave Desert, the other near the coast, and both separated by the next clade up in the genealogy. Also, in dividual haplotypes attributed to the Mojave Desert lo calities are phenotypically distinguishable from all other individuals contained within the clade (i.e., they are much lighter in color; see Fig. 3). In addition, clade C1B contains the only examples of haplotypes shared among localities (labeled as SI and S2 in Fig. 6a). Although some of the lineages embedded within clade 1 would likely fail tests of Ge and Ei given additional sampling, and thus represent distinct species, the existing data necessitate their retention as a single species. Due to complete sampling along the central Califor nia coast, clade 2 at node F (Fig. 7) is one of the few instances in which Ge can be evaluated using a more fine-scale approach like NCA. As noted previously, clade 2 is restricted to the coastal dunes along the beaches of Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco counties (Fig. 6b). The basal-most haplotype MTY01 (Fig. 6b, sub clade C2A) is isolated to the south and is genetically separated from all other haplotypes by over 150 base pairs. Although we have not been able to sample the dunes at Point Sur, just 6.44 km to the north, it seems highly unlikely that this branch would be significantly broken up due to recovery of haplotypes from this local ity. Although the NCA results are not shown here (for brevity?see online supplementary material available at www.systematicbiology.org), significant associations be tween haplotypes and geography as a consequence of fragmentation occur at a number of hierarchical levels within clade 2. For example, despite minimal geographic separation with respect to total distance, subclades C2B and C2C (Fig. 6b) appear to be fragmented across Ano Nuevo Point. Given the close geographical proximity of these clades, the absence of both corroborative phylogeo graphic barriers and notable adaptive divergence (Fig. 2, S3), we consider this to be an example of structuring due to artifact and retain the species boundary at the clade 2 level (but see caveats regarding this decision below). At node G (Fig. 7), clade 3, like clade 1, is an area where additional sampling may be required. The basal-most subclade (C3A; Fig. 6c) is represented by a single locality, Pinnacles, situated at the southern end of the Gabilan Range, across the Salinas Valley from the remaining members of clade 3. As previously discussed, the Salinas Valley represents a known geographic bar rier. In consideration of this, plus the degree of genetic divergence and geographic disjunction, we judge this subclade to be non-GE with the others. It is also likely to be non-Ei, as indicated by the very low probability of suitable habitat at Pinnacles according to the Maxent model (Fig. 5a) despite the inclusion of that locality in training earlier versions of the model (not shown). However, due to the limited sampling, we consider an interpretation of non-Ei to be premature and retain all subclades as a single unit. Alternatively, this locality may represent a relictual population (see Stockman and Bond, 2007). The clades defined by nodes H and D (Fig. 7) are not evaluated at this point as they (clades 4 and 5) were collapsed due to apparent Ge and Ei at the previous basal lineage demarcation. The most derived subclades of clade 5 (Fig. 6f, node I in Fig. 7) are unequivocally adaptively divergent and</page><page sequence="14">2008_BOND AND STOCKMAN?SPECIES DELIMITATION WITH EXTREME POPULATION STRUCTURING_641 form exclusive groupings in both the mtDNA and ITS genealogies. Based on the character reconstruction of spider habitat, this lineage is restricted to the northern coastal dunes, and it exhibits the same distinctive char acteristics as the clade 2 coastal specimens (e.g., lighter coloration, deeper burrows, heavier silk). Therefore, we consider this clade to be both non-Gn and non-Ei with the other subclades and retain it for consideration for species delineation despite the fact that it renders clade 4+5 paraphyletic (see discussion of this issue below). Summary of species delimitation.?Based on the results reported herein, we hypothesize that the Aptostichus atomarius complex comprises minimally five cohesion species (diagnosed and described in Appendix); that is, groups of populations that meet the criteria of evolu tionary lineage, genetic exchangeability, and ecological interchangeability. Clades delimited as species are those lineages defined by nodes E, F, G, C-I, and I (Fig. 7). Clade 1 (as defined at node E) is restricted to southern California's Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, the Los Angeles Basin, and the Mojave Desert (Fig. 6a). This clade as presently constructed contains haplotypes sampled from the putative type locality and thus would retain the specific epithet, atomarius; however, given the extreme habitat variability and phenotypic differences already noted, bolstered sampling will likely result in the discov ery of additional cohesion species, most notably a species adaptively diverged for desert conditions. Clade 2 (Fig. 7, node F), Aptostichus stephencolberti sp. nov., is restricted to the coastal dunes that extend from the Big Sur area to the San Francisco peninsula at Point Lobos and Golden Gate (Fig. 6b). Members of this clade are considered to be non-Ei with populations of its sister clade (clade 1) due to its specificity to coastal dunes and divergent phenotype (Fig. 3). These populations are spatially separated from all other "atomarius" complex members. Clade 3 (Fig. 7, node G), Aptostichus angelinajolieae sp. nov., is geograph ically restricted to the Coastal Range south of the San Francisco Bay (Fig. 6c). Our evaluation of Ei based on niche-based DM shows there to be little overlap in the "selective regime" of clade 3 and other closely related lineages. The Salinas Valley is a hypothesized barrier to Ge- Clade 4+5 (Fig. 7, defined at node C sans subclade defined at node I), Aptostichus stanfordianus, has a distri bution that is essentially east of the San Andreas Fault (Fig. 6d, e). It includes San Francisco Peninsula popula tions and populations that extend northward through out the Diablo, Gabilan, and northern coast ranges. The subclade defined at node I, Aptostichus miwok sp. nov., comprises the northern coastal dune endemic popula tions whose distribution extends from the Golden Gate at Point Bonita northward (Fig. 6f). Assessment and Self-Critique The approach that we have taken to delineating species among these highly divergent lineages is not without is sues and certain limitations and consequently requires critical examination. We discuss below these limitations, including use of mtDNA as a primary genetic marker, the perils and pitfalls of evaluating ecological interchange ability, and the recognition of paraphyletic lineages as species. tntDNA as a population marker.?Although widely ap plied (Moore, 1995; Avise, 2000), there are a number of reasons why mtDNA may be inadequate. Well docu mented are the potential problems of gene-tree/species tree incongruence, introgression (McGuire et al., 2007), intracellular symbionts, and selection (see Ballard and Whitlock, 2004; Ballard and Rand, 2005; Hurst and Jiggins, 2005). Moreover, exclusivity among mtDNA haplotypes generally far outpaces time to exclusivity in nuclear alleles (Hudson and Coyne, 2002). Despite these criticisms, insights gained through mtDNA markers over the past 25 years have been immense (Rubinoff and Holland, 2005) and recent comparative phylogeographic studies show obvious and compelling consistencies in mtDNA genealogies among disparate taxa (see Lapointe and Rissler, 2005; Rissler et al., 2006; Feldman and Spicer, 2006, for California phylogeography). The congruence we observe between the nuclear (ITS) and mtDNA data likewise supports the suitability of these data in highly structured taxa and suggests that mtDNA alone may be adequate for establishing a topological framework. Still, we advocate an integrative approach to delineate species, one that places strong consideration towards adaptive divergence (sensu Crandall et al., 2000). For example, although the genetics underlying adaptations related to inhabiting a coastal dune environment remain untested, the invariance of these features for coastal lin eages suggests a potential nuclear genetic basis that is consistent with mtDNA genealogical exclusivity. Fur thermore, otherwise seemingly cryptic (i.e., morphologi cally) divergent mitochondrial lineages have been shown to remain cohesive in zones of secondary contact (Bond and Sierwald, 2002). All of these issues taken together, coupled with the general successes realized through the application of mtDNA-based phylogenetics (Rubinoff and Holland, 2005) and demonstrated congruence with nuclear markers here and in other spider studies (e.g., Hedin, 2001; Hendrixson and Bond, 2005; Starrett and Hedin, 2007), warrant continued but cautious use of these molecular data. Evaluating ecological interchangeability.?The evalua tion of ecological interchangeability is nontrivial. First, our assessments of ecological interchangeability with regard to the coastal lineages are qualitative judg ments in need of further testing. The biotic and abi otic conditions for these psammophilic populations are observably nonoverlapping with all inland lineages of A. atomarius. Moreover, coastal populations are pheno typically distinct (see Fig. 3). Abdominal coloration is likely an inherited trait that potentially enhances the sur vivability of mature wandering males by making them more cryptic on a light, sandy surface (Hoekstra et al., 2006). Females are likewise much lighter in color, but they seldom leave their burrows; thus, selection on female coloration is unlikely. However, dune environments are relatively unstable and long-lived females may be dis placed occasionally, providing instances whereby female</page><page sequence="15">642_SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY_VOL. 57 crypsis would be advantageous. It appears that dune endemic Aptostichus build deeper burrows perhaps in response to the less stable dune environment. Future as sessments of burrow architecture could provide key com ponents to understanding adaptive divergence among Aptostichus atomarius clades. One could argue that be cause these spiders are fossorial, they are buffered from the environment and thus the impact of climate with re spect to "selective regime" is minimized. However, Ap tostichus burrows, in general, are very shallow (only a few centimeters) and mature males leave their burrows to wander. Consequently, male maturation times vary tremendously across populations and species in appar ent response to the onset of the rainy seasons and other climatic factors (Bond, 1999). Second, the evaluation of ecological interchangeabil ity using niche-based distribution modeling requires close scrutiny despite its obvious appeal and already demonstrated utility in evaluating speciation pattern and process (e.g., Graham et al., 2004a; Stockman and Bond, 2007; Jakob et al., 2007; McGuire et al., 2007; Rissler and Apodaca, 2007). Niche-based distribution models are generally viewed as a prediction of the or ganism's realized niche because occurrence localities are drawn exclusively from the source habitat (Phillips et al., 2006). The realized niche is thus a subset of the fundamental niche, which defines the environmen tal conditions under which the organism can survive in the absence of other biotic interactions or histor ical constraints. Because we can only model the re alized niche, the possibility exists that lineages with nonoverlapping predicted distributions could ostensibly occupy the same fundamental niche; that is, nonexclu sive subsets of the realized niche appear in the predic tion. We therefore caution that nonoverlap of predicted distribution warrants further testing (Rader et al., 2005, see discussion below). Alternatively, although overlap ping predicted distributions may support the null hy pothesis of ecological interchangeability, they do not necessarily preclude noninterchangeability. Overpredic tion indicates that a species' environmental tolerances are more extensive than observed and that other fac tors (e.g., biotic interactions) may be limiting geographic range (Wiens and Graham, 2005). We envision a sce nario in which the competitive interactions of two sis ter species whose distributions have been modeled are precluding sympatry. Moreover, overlap of a predicted distribution could suggest evidence of niche conserva tion among sister species or lineages?speciation occur ring in the absence of ecological divergence (see Bond et al., 2001). Sister species pairs have been demonstrated, through niche modeling approaches (Peterson et al., 1999), to occupy similar climatic niches. Such conser vation would play a significant role in geographic spe ciation when climate across a barrier was unsuitable, limiting gene flow between isolated populations (Wiens and Graham, 2005). Niche-based distribution modeling provides a robust evaluative tool for delimiting species boundaries but one warranting careful consideration and interpretation. What are the next steps regarding formalized tests of ecological interchangeability? And, to what extent is fur ther testing needed for seemingly obvious ecological dis parities (e.g., coastal versus inland A. atomarius)? Rader et al. (2005:239) define populations as ecologically inter changeable "when individuals can be moved between different local populations and still occupy the same ecological niche or selective regime"; that is, if distinc tive populations are exposed to differing environmen tal conditions to which they become locally adapted, they are no longer ecologically interchangeable. If genet ically nonequivalent populations differ in "phenotypic" expression of a trait(s), then they are considered to be noninterchangeable. The ideal of reciprocal transplant and common environment experimentation is without question unfeasible for certain many organismal groups. Thus, further work is needed to design tests of ecological interchangeability that can be more easily implemented and are feasible for the rapid biodiversity assessments re quired in some conservation situations. The life history characteristics (e.g., long maturation times, &gt;4 years) make ecological experiments like those of Rader et al. (2005) untenable for organisms like trapdoor spiders. Moreover, reciprocal transplant experiments are poten tially irresponsible and environmentally unethical un der many circumstances. Alternatively, environmental chamber-based experiments could be designed for A. atomarius that involve experiments that test the ability of non-dune-adapted spiders to build functional burrows in sand and vice versa. Is evaluation of ecological interchangeability necessary?? Given the close correlation between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation (Funk et al., 2006?discussed by Rissler and Apodaca, 2007) and consequently the putative role of ecological differenti ation in speciation process, an evaluation of ecological interchangeability should play some significant role in species delimitation. At issue is whether genetic diver gence in the absence of ecological change or adaptive divergence of some other type is sufficient for species recognition. We would argue that minimally some variation or disparity in present day selective regime must be demonstrated among morphologically identical lineages, particularly when they are parapatric (i.e., future gene flow is plausible). This perspective must be balanced with the potential for what might be charac terized as non-adaptive radiation or niche conservatism among sister lineages. However, highly structured systems by definition are predisposed to allopatric fragmentation and have the relatively unique charac teristic of achieving exclusivity prior to the evolution of isolation or cohesion mechanisms (see Harrison, 1998). The requirement of adaptive divergence, or capacity for adaptive divergence through the occupation of different selective regimes, echoes Crandall et al. (2000), who argued that recognition of evolutionary significant units (ESUs) for the purposes of conservation required more than measures of "genetic isolation." Adaptive diver gence in the form of ecological or morphological change, in concert with genetic isolation, better addresses</page><page sequence="16">2008_BOND AND STOCKMAN?SPECIES DELIMITATION WITH EXTREME POPULATION STRUCTURING_643 the goal of conserving the evolutionary potential of populations. Indeed, a review of the current speciation literature reveals that many studies assessing species boundaries are multidisciplinary (Johnson et al, 2004; Daniels et al., 2005; Yoder et al., 2005; Sanders et al., 2006; Schlick-Steiner et al., 2006; Roe and Sperling, 2007) and likely meet the adaptive divergence criterion set forth here and by Crandall et al. (2000). Far fewer studies seem to advocate the recognition of lineages solely on genetic divergence, exclusivity, or geographic concordance (e.g., Bond et al., 2001; Kronauer et al., 2005). Nonexclusivity of species.?Species-level paraphyly (re viewed by Funk and Omland, 2003), is more preva lent among species groups than previously thought. Our recognition of lineage I (Figs. 6f, 7), the northern coastal dune endemic, as a species, renders clade 4+5 para phyletic. We prefer nonexclusivity in favor of ignoring the adaptive divergence shared by all members of the coastal lineage. Consequently, we also elected not to el evate the remaining lineages within clade 5 to species to correct for nonexclusivity (what Templeton, 1998, char acterized as "speciation by remote control"). Such hier archical recalibration would mask the budding nature of this incipient speciation event (i.e., peripatric) and would be inconsistent with the criterion of adaptive divergence we enforced on other parts of the tree. The northern coastal populations occur at a much shallower level of di vergence and are in fact the most derived lineage on the tree, yet this lineage is phenotypically distinguishable from the remaining members of clade 5. This suggests that adaptive divergence has been rapid and recent and thus nonexclusivity is a likely consequence of incomplete lineage sorting rather than issues related to phylogenetic signal or imperfect taxonomy (Hendrixson and Bond, 2005). The recency of this speciation event is consistent with north/south breaks observed in other Pacific coast endemic taxa (Edmands, 2001) and is the likely conse quence of post-Pleistocene range expansion to the north (Burns and Barhoum, 2006). Summary and Future Directions We present in this paper an approach to species delin eation for highly geographically structured species that seeks to abrogate vexing problems encountered when testing species boundaries in such groups. Many non vagile organisms have populations that are genetically unique, deeply divergent, and often morphologically ho mogenous. As such, commonly employed methodolo gies and conceptual approaches to species delineation are either rendered inapplicable by the data or run the risk of fractionating lineages into numerous species when applied haphazardly. Once a set of basal lineages are identified, we then use an iterative process to exam ine them, starting at a predesignated basal point mov ing upward through the phylogeny, examining lineages for genetic exchangeability and ecological interchange ability. A final examination towards the tips of the phy logeny ensures that instances of incipient speciation are not overlooked due to gene-tree/species-tree incongru ence. We evaluate genetic exchangeability through as sessments of geographical concordance and evidence of allopatric fragmentation. Ecological interchangeability is evaluated using niche-based distribution modeling and general assessment of habitat differences using character state reconstructions. For divergent lineages with para patric geographic distributions, but appearing to remain ecologically interchangeable, we elect to retain these lin eages as cohesion species (sensu Crandall et al., 2000). The approach we outline is applied to the Aptostichus atomarius species complex. This group is widely dis tributed (Figs. 1, 6) across diverse habitats, a situation that predisposes populations, lineages, to become lo cally adapted (Calsbeek et al., 2003). And, parallel origins of psammophilic phenotypes underscore the adaptive nature of the species radiation within this group of spi ders at both deep and shallow phylogenetic levels. Phy logenetic evaluation of the Aptostichus atomarius complex identifies five lineages that should be considered cohe sion species. Although our work on the Aptostichus atomarius species complex remains unfinished, the approach taken here provides a framework that will direct future ques tions and areas of research emphasis in this group of spiders. Increased sampling across the Mojave and the Transverse Ranges will likely resolve two additional species. Second, the coastal dune endemic clades pro vide an opportunity to study the parallel evolution of coastal dune adaptation and the evolution of ecological interchangeability within a sister group context (as dis cussed earlier with regards to the ideas of Rader et al., 2005). Finally, the complex geology, climatic, and biotic environment of the California Floristic Province provides a remarkable backdrop for which to consider the histor ical biogeography of this widespread species complex within a comparative phylogeographic framework (e.g., Calsbeek et al., 2004; Lapointe and Rissler, 2005; Rissler et al., 2006, Feldman and Spicer, 2006).

Detailed descriptions and illustrations of these taxa will follow in a monograph treating the diversity of the entire genus. We rely on unique combinations of nucleotide substitutions for diagno sis (sensu Bond and Sierwald, 2002; Bond, 2004). Nucleotide changes given in bold type are changes that occur in the clade in question and are not positions that show reversals to a more common state found immediately outside the species being diagnosed. Alignment positions used for diagnosis can be ascertained from the reference alignment de posited in TreeBASE (accession numbers S2114). Species authorship is to be attributed to the first author (J. E. Bond). Species of the Atomarius complex (Cyrtaucheniidae: Euctenizinae) Aptostichus atomarius Simon 1891, clade 1, Southern California.

USA, Cali fornia, San Mateo County, Pescadero State Beach. 122.41219, -37.26598, elev. 4 m. Colls. A. Stockman, P. Marek, 29 Jan 2006. Diagnosis.?Aptostichus stephencolberti can be distinguished from the other closely related species on the basis of the following unique mtDNA nucleotide substitutions at the following reference alignment positions: a (154), A (161), G (307), G (596), T (683), A (684), G (691), G (706), T (709), G (742), G (747), C (771), A (867), G (909) A (948), T (963), G (1023), G (1062), A (1068), a (1111), T (1378), T (1383), t (1385), T (1389), T (1475). This species is lighter in coloration than A. angelinajolieae and is restricted to beach habitats, whereas A. angelinajolieae is darker in color and found inland. Etymology.?The specific epithet is a patronym, named in honor of Mr. Stephen Colbert. Mr. Colbert is a fellow citizen who truly has the courage of his convictions and is willing to undertake the very difficult and sometimes unpopular work of speaking out against those who have done irreparable harm to our country and the world through both action and inaction. He will be especially remembered by many of Jason Bond's generation for his speech at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner. Description.?Male holotype.
