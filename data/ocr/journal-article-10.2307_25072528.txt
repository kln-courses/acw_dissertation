<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tools-?-Us Jonathan B. King ABSTRACT. Our methods of inquiry predetermine most of what we are able to know. While our modes of understand ing ought to correspond to the complexities confronting us in our modern technological society, they do not. "Soft" systems methodology helps us focus on what is problematic and how it can be approached ? and offers direction to exert moral control over our tools and technologies. [Powerful new technologies] pose basic threats to people and to life on Earth . . . Unless we learn to live with them in safety, our future is likely to be both exciting and short. We cannot hope to foresee all the problems ahead, yet by paying attention to the big, basic issues, we can perhaps foresee the greatest challenges and get some idea of how to deal with them (K. Erik Drexler, 1986). Drexler's acclaimed book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, illustrates a major dilemma posed by powerful new technologies such as advanced generation computing systems, genetic engineering, and molecular sized "engines of crea tion." While all promise often mind-boggling bene fits, all pose potential risks in all areas of our lives ? legal, political, economic, social, cultural, and spir itual. Thus, whether you are a technophile, techno phobe, or neither, Drexler's admonition to start "paying attention to the big, basic issues" makes sense. It helps to sort these big, basic issues into different clusters of risks. In order to sort out some of the Jonathan King is Associate Professor of Management at the College of Business at Oregon State University. His primary research interests are in moral philosophy and systems theory. His most important publications are "Common Knowledge of the Second Kind" (1989) and "Learning to Solve the Right Problems" (1993), Journal of Business Ethics. "messiness" inherent to powerful new technologies, it is even more helpful to view them in terms of levels of complexity because different levels of com plexity demand different strategies and, in particular, different understandings of what it means to be morally responsible.1 Specifically, the ways we talk, our methods of inquiry, and the ways we organize ourselves pre determine most of what we are able to know. Therefore, these modes of understanding ought to correspond to the complexities confronting us in our modern technological society. They do not. We already know how to pay attention to one big, basic issue: the very real risks of someone or some group using a powerful technology with the intended objective of exploiting others. For example, we may not be able to predict when, where, and how some disgruntled employee will "take out" Citibank's data base or some terrorist group will treat London's water supply to a virulent strain of genetically engineered influenza, but at least we understand that we need to anticipate and thwart the intended objectives of such individuals and groups. So-called "rational choice theory" which is foun dational to economic analysis and political theory operates at this level of complexity. Sophisticated strategies for thwarting the intended objectives of others are the stuff of game theory.2 A business version familiar to all of us is "management by objectives." At this level of complexity both the what and the how are assumed to be relatively unprob lematic. We are slowly learning how to pay attention to a second, big, basic issue: the risks of unintended dis asters, where systems ? not individuals or groups ? run amuck. For example, we may not be able to predict when, where, and how a nuclear power plant may suffer a catastrophic meltdown or the computer Journal of Business Ethics 13: 243-257, 1994. ? 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">244 Jonathan King trading of stocks may precipitate a stock market crash, but we are beginning to understand the need to recognize and take appropriate measures for systems which are sufficiently complex and tightly coupled that they are accidents we know are waiting to happen. So-called "hard" systems methodology operates at this level of complexity. The more sophisticated strategies for dealing with systems-that-run-amuck are emerging from general systems theory.3 A busi ness version familar to some of us is "total quality management" (TQM). At this level of complexity, the what is relatively unproblematic with the focus on the how. In the case of TQM, the focus is on the continual improvement of processes given the goal of anticipating customers' expectations. We have just begun learning to pay attention to a third, big, basic issue: the risks of allowing our tools and technologies to shape our intentions. What this idea entails is suggested, for example, by Joseph Weizenbaum's warning: "We can count, but we are rapidly forgetting how to say what is worth counting and why" (Weizenbaum, 1976, p. 16). Put another way, a potential danger is not so much that com puters will think like us but that we will start thinking like computers. Overall, the aim of Soft Systems Methodology is to take seriously the subjectivity which is the crucial characteristic of human affairs and to treat this subjectivity, if not exactly scientifically, at least in a way characerized by intellecual rigour. Checkland and Scholes, 1990. So-called "soft" systems methodology operates at this level of complexity. The more sophisticated strategies are illustrated by the great artists who have both anticipated and created, decades in advance, the "landscapes" and "portraits" that are central to subsequent theorizing in the social sciences (Nisbet, 1976). A business version familiar to almost none of us is the "learning organization" where leadership is conceived to be an art. At this level, both the what and the how are at issue: the problem is determining what is problematic and how it can be approached. More radically, the issue is determining what the problem ought to be. Here, the focus is on continu ally improving the processes of our institutionalized minds. There is at least one compelling reason to focus on this third, big, basic issue. If we fail to learn how to exert moral control over our tools and tech nologies, then both the likehihoods and stakes of intentional-misuses-of-powerful-tools as well as complex-systems-running-amuck will continue to increase. Choices In a classroom I use, there is a cleat screwed onto the back of a cabinet containing a VCR. I always find the VCR's electrical cord tightly wrapped round and round the cleat. This is rather odd for it would certainly save time and energy if one were to simply drape the cord over the cleat in a couple of large loops. So, who is telling me and my colleagues, "Wrap the electrical cord tightly around the cleat"? The cleat? The members of a university committee charged with reviewing curricular change proposals dutifully filled out a variety of forms as part of our assigned task. Lots of forms, detailed forms, multi-copy forms. One day I thought to ask, "Why?" From there, it was pretty easy sledding with the ultimate result of one, one-page, single-copy form which has subsequently saved hundreds of faculty man-hours annually. So, who was telling a bunch of Ph.D.'s to waste so much time filling out forms? The forms? What is going on here? As Mary Douglas points out, "institutions cannot have minds of their own," nor can cleats and forms. Organizations do not make decisions, nor do cleats and forms. Individuals have minds and make decisions, yet we get the contrary impression that the above decisions were actually made by us. The individual calculates what is in his best interest and acts accordingly. This is the basis of the theory on which economic analysis and political theory are based, and yet we get the contrary impression. Mary Douglas, 1986. Consider, instead, the possibility that "[People] make new kinds of institutions, and the institutions make new labels, and the labels make new kinds of people" (Douglas, 1986, p. 108) and that "[t]he tool as</page><page sequence="3">Tools-A-Us 245 symbol . . . thus transcends its role as a practical means toward certain ends" (Weizenbaum, 1976, p. 25). In general, consider the possibility that while we shape tools to achieve intended results, our tools in turn shape our intentions. If tools shape intentions and this notion seems obvious enough, then why do Douglas and Weizen baum, for example, go to such great lengths to point it out?4 Don't most of us realize the degree to which Tools-?-Us? Don't most of us realize that when you are in a room full of hammers, you look around for nails to pound? As is often remarked, reason has descended from a consideration of ends to a concern merely with means. Reason . . . is in this curtailed outlook seen as something that serves us: an instrument to be used, in our pursuit of whatever personal interests we may happen or may choose to have. Wilfred Cantwell Smith, 1988. Instrumental rationality Rational Choice Theory exemplifies an instrumental rationality. To understand what this view of ration ality implies, consider what this theory takes as axiomatic: the individual calculates what is in his best interest and acts accordingly. Yet in the end, "best-interest" is a variable rather than being a given. Mother Teresa's self-interest differs qualitatively and empirically from Charlie Manson's. Again, if this seems obvious enough, why do Charles Perrow, Mary Douglas, John Elster, and Peter Senge, for example, need to point this out?5 Self-interest-as-a-variable opens a Pandora's box. Assuming we have control over some of the things that shape our self-interest, then what is in our self interest to define as our self-interest? Put precisely, how do we, as participants ? constrasted to detached observers ? determine what our subjective interests should be? The use of objective terms to analyze our subjective preferences may help, but at some point this merely begs the larger questions postponed by using so-called "objective" terms.6 A dilemma Rational Choice Theory reflects a fundamental strategy of the Enlightenment's paradigm, a process that symbolizes how to protect us against the very real dangers of ethical relativism. Like our prede cessors, without some means of "objectively" talking about things that matter, we are lost. Without some sort of trustworthy ways of establishing common ground, we leave ourselves vulnerable to the passions of the moment and the machinations of those who lust for power. Thus, Rational Choice Theory indeed takes "seriously the subjectivity which is the crucial characteristic of human affairs" by trying to contain it through objective methodology. On the other hand, many of the epistemological assumptions underpining "objectivism" have been increasingly qualified ? if not rejected ? by philoso phers of science over the last several decades. For example, it is now commonplace to claim that "in natural science what count as data are determined in the light of some theoretical interpretation" and "the language of natural science is irreducibly metaphori cal and inexact" (Bernstein, 1983, p. 33). Thus, as Richard Bernstein points out, the dilemma confront ing us is "objectivism versus relativism." Put bluntly, the objectivist epistemology we inher ited from the Enlightenment can no longer defend us against the fact that there is no escaping the subjective determination of our subjective preferences. To pretend otherwise, legitimizes an instrumental rationality where reason is narrowly conceived as something that serves us ? simply as an instrument to be used. Specifically, this narrow understanding of reason seduces us with the belief that we use our tools ? especially our methods of inquiry and our theories of ourselves ? to achieve various ends. Such "manage ment by objectives" leaves us exceedingly vulnerable before the onslaught of powerful new technological systems. A theory of institutions that will amend the current unsociological view of human cognition is needed, and a cognitive theory to supplement the weaknesses of institutional analysis is needed as well. Mary Douglas, 1986. As with most dilemmas and paradoxes, a better</page><page sequence="4">246 Jonathan King strategy is to transcend them rather than trying to solve them on their own terms. To do this, we need to recognize major aspects of our current, predominant epistemology which are increasingly anachronistic. We then need to transform an up-to date epistemology into a practical methodology such as "soft systems" methodology. Finally, we need to institutionalize this more collaborative, more social methodology in business, in higher learning, and in our political processes. Paradigm shifts In order to understand "systems," we must distance ourselves from a number of entrenched epistemo logical assumptions. Ideally, this process entails a rigorous examination of how we think we think. As with any paradigm shift, the key challenges emerg ing from "general systems theory" allow us to ask different and potentially fruitful questions within a larger framework of understanding. My first purpose in distinguishing these views has been to make them visible. The second is to establish the latter of them as a possible foundation for [alternative methods]. Andrew Abbott, 1990. The following is a list of anachronistic epistemo logical assumptions.7 Each is followed by various claims which do not "fit," then by some potentially fruitful questions. Reality conceived in terms of objects and events "In the interest of better organizational understand ing we should urge people to stamp out nouns" (Weick, 1979, p. 44). Alternatively, entities or objects such as organizations may be better understood as "bundles of inter-acting relations, internal and exter nal" (Vickers, 1981, p. 16); modern technologies such as nuclear power plants may be better understood as "complex socio-technical systems that interact at and between micro and macro levels" (King, 1993). More radically, the "deep structures" of everyday reality arguably consist of "logics of change" which often exhibit recursiveness ? logics which include changes in the logics themselves (Morgan, 1986, ch. 8). In general, such observations imply that to better understand "systems," relationships may be as signifi cant ? perhaps more significant ? than objects; and interactive processes may be as significant ? perhaps more significant ? than events. For example, to better understand how tools shape our intentions, it may be useful to think of "values" in terms of relationships or processes, not only as nouns. For example, to better manage in today's global economy it may be wise to organize ourselves around processes rather than departments or divi sions. Reality conceived in terms of the lowest common denominator "Nature (and that includes us) is not made up of parts within wholes. It is made up of wholes within wholes" (Senge, 1990, p. 371). Interactive processes and relationships exist in hierarchies of wholes ? e.g., cells, organs, organisms, groups, nations (Miller, 1979). Because patterns of interactions or wholes emerge at successively higher levels of complexity, higher levels cannot be fully explained in terms of lower levels. In general, there are multiple levels of reality ? nested or layered "contexts." Thus our minds can be modeled in terms of neuronal maps, maps of maps, and maps of maps of maps (Edelman, 1987). For example, to better understand how tools shape our intentions, it may be useful to think of "values" in terms of actions chosen at multiple levels of contexts rather than mere aggregations of individ ual choices. Thus, to speak of "modern technology" as a self-justifying process, presupposes such a higher-order context (Jonas, 1979). For example, given the increasing complexities of today's business world, it may be wise for managers to focus on assuming responsibility for "optimizing systems." Blaming problems on "operator error," "a competitive environment," or "adversarial relation ships" may be examples of attribution errors.</page><page sequence="5">Tools-A-Us 247 Reality conceived in terms of linear causality Karl Weick points out that "[m]ost managers get into trouble because they forget to think in circles" (Weick, 1979, p. 86). So do most parents (Boden hamer, 1983). More significant, the revelations at the heart of "chaos theory" hinge, in large part, on distancing ourselves from various forms of linearity (Gleick, 1987). In general, linear logics such as inductive and deductive logic are inadequate without considering that most phenomena exhibit "recursiveness" where cause alters effect which alters cause which alters effect. Thus, when conclusions simply justify a premise ? instead of explaining it ? a circular logic works to insure self-fulfilling prophecies, self-refer encing systems, and self-justifying systems. [T]here is no more important element in education today than the understanding of the systems which we form and by which we are both sustained and constrained. Geoffrey Vickers, 1981. For example, to better understand how tools shape our intentions, we may need to better under stand how our values affect our choices, how the choices we and others make affect our values, and how these values in turn affect our choices and so on in potentially self-justifying processes. For example, if you believe workers are irrespon sible, you may turn out to be right; if you believe workers are responsible, you may turn out to be right. Reality conceived in a-contextual terms Linear and circular logics are both inadequate in another crucial way. The "logic of patterns" is at the crux of human creativity. In particular, the "aha!" logic of scientific discovery is strikingly similar to the "ha-ha" logic of humor and the "ah ..." logic of self-transcending artistic creation. In the case of laughter, the pattern is "the perceiving of a situation or idea in two self-consistent but mutually incom patible frames of reference or asssociated contexts" (Koestler, 1976, pp. 113?4; emphasis added). In general, we shall see that "playing-with-para digms" is therefore a key strategy for learning-how to-learn and is an essential element of learning-how to-unlearn. More significantly, because all patterns presuppose "values," when you play with paradigms you are seeking, implicitly, what matters. [The later Wittgenstein] argued that the analysis of everyday situations into facts and rules (which is where most traditional philosophers and [Artificial Intelligence] researchers think theory must begin) is itself only meaningful in some context and for some purpose. The elements chosen already reflect the goals and purposes for which they are carved out. Daedalus, 1988. For example, perhaps the value of "values" inheres in the contexts whose structures confer meaning on them. Thus, to better understand how tools shape our intentions, playing-with-paradigms may be a valuable way of explicitly dealing with what matters. For example, the so-called "Asian Phenomenon" is neglected in too many organizations: (l) We make rules based on good reasons, (2) We follow these rules, (3) Time passes and contexts change, (4) We continue to follow the rules as if what mattered still matters (von Oech, 1990, p. 61). Reality conceived in a-historical terms While mechanistic explanations work for rocks and stars and functionalist explanations add to our under standings of birds and bees, neither may be adequate to deal with that subjectivity which is the crucial characteristic of human affairs. To explain ourselves to ourselves, we need "intentionalist" explanations that capture the purposiveness we humans need to impose on our worlds for them to make sense to us. Hence the central significance of stories and their big brothers, myths.8 In general, the "narrative" as opposed to the "causal-stochastic" approach to understanding our selves focuses on that particular kind of pattern where the "[beginning, middle, and end are all of one piece, the one leading ineluctably to the next." Nevertheless, "[tjhe stochastic view is overwhelm ingly dominant in empirical social science" (Abbott, 1990, p. 141).9 Unfortunately, the latter view runs the risks of ignoring the fact that while we are</page><page sequence="6">248 Jonathan King necessarily actors in our scripts, we are also their authors. More radically, it ignores the fact that when we tell stories about the future, we participate in the creation of our futures. For example, to better understand how tools shape our intentions, perhaps we would be wise to understand how tools function as "scripts." For example, perhaps the best firms share a sense of vision which allows their members to participate in the creation of their future rather than merely "adapting to the environment." Perhaps, as with Einstein's general theory of rela tivity, it will take a generation for these up-to-date concepts to "sink in." The better bet is not to wait, for institutions have logics of their own and these logics most certainly include resisting new logics. Learning how to learn: playing with paradigms Over thirty years ago, Thomas Kuhn popularized the concept of "paradigms" in The Structure of Scien tific Revolutions. There are, by now, a number of roughly equivalent terms for paradigms including mental models, filters, neuronal maps, frames, repre sentations, and schema. Yet despite the widespread usage of these terms, it is an understatement to point out that their full implications have yet to be realized. The impact on managers1 understanding of mental models is profound ? most report that they see for the first time in their life that all we ever have are assumptions, never "truths," that we always see the world through our mental models and that the mental models are always incomplete, and especially in Western culture, chronically nonsystemic. Peter Senge, 1990. Paradigms ? "patterns" ? come in all shapes and sizes ranging from routines for cooking eggs on a gas stove in the morning, analytical methods, theories of ourselves, to worldviews. At the crux of these many uses of the term are two crucial insights. The first comes from the root meaning of paradigm: we perceive and conceive of things in terms of "pat terns" or, more generally, "in context." The second is that these patterns are not "discovered out-there" in any simple sense but are active constructions of our understandings.10 A joke introduces the implications of these two crucial insights. On a dark night, a policeman asks a drunk what he is searching for under a streetlight. When the drunk tells him he is looking for his car keys, the policeman asks him where he dropped them. "Over there," the drunk replies, pointing to a dark area down the street. "Then why are you looking for them here?" asks the policeman. The drunk offers the obvious answer: "Because there's a light here." In vino veritas? The real joke is on those who persist in believing that the joke is on the drunk. At least our drunk realizes that he needs another street light (read mental model or paradigm) to find his keys. The first major implication is that we human beings cannot function without paradigms anymore than a computer can function without software programs. Thus, we can conceive an "objective" or a "subjective" reality, but there are no given "rules," in particular there is no methodology, that can promise, even as an ideal, immaculate perception, conception, thinking, or acting. The second major implication is that because our paradigms are always incomplete, we are looking, therefore, for "best fits" at any one time and place ? our paradigms become points of comparison in our webs of thought. Exhibit I Playing-with-Paradigms "The map is not the territory" "In-Our-Minds" - "Our-There" On both counts, the challenge is to deal with our subjectivty in ways characterized by intellectual</page><page sequence="7">Tools-A-Us 249 rigour. An essential aspect of this process of com parison is "playing-with-paradigms." Signs Consider the "practical" implications of an observa tion from the introduction to a special (1988) issue of Daedalus devoted to artificial intelligence. In heuristic problem solving programs, the search for solutions within a problem space is conducted and con trolled by heuristic rules. The representation that defines the problem space is the problem solver's "way of looking at" the problem and also specifies the form of solutions. Choosing a representation that is right for a problem can improve spectacularly the efficiency of the solution finding process. The choice of problem representation is the job of the human programmer and is a creative act. Playing-with-paradigms, therefore, literally allows us to see things we could not see before. For example, when dealing with others, "seeking first to understand then to be understood" is a surprisingly powerful and, more surprising, infrequently used strategy (Covey, 1989). Moreover, a commitment to listen to others first is the sine qua non of true dialogue. (Shades of the Golden Rule?) Playing-with-paradigms also allows new percep tions to emerge in the sense that our binocular vision allows us to see things which cannot be perceived by two separate eyes. For example, when antagonists come to understand they are in the same boat, new understanding may emerge. (Shades of compassion?) Last, playing-with-paradigms can reveal to us how we have been "boxing-out" alternative ways of thinking and behaving. For example, to varying degrees we all unwittingly expect our spouses to help us complete the unfinished business of our child hoods (Hendrix, 1988). And like our organizations, we rarely learn our limitations from trial and error but, instead, we "know" them through mutually reenacting our boxes.11 (Shades of that ancient injunction, "Know thyself"?) Lists Playing-with-paradigms requires some paradigms to play with. So, where do we find those mind-altering schema, frameworks, and examples? It certainly helps to listen to others. In particular, it helps to encourage others to take "mental risks" by encouraging "what if" questions. More significant, it helps to be curious. I once asked advertising legend Carl Ally what makes the creative person tick. Ally responded, "The creative person wants to be a know-it-all. He wants to know about all kinds of things: ancient history, nineteenth century mathematics, current manufacturing techniques, flower arranging, and hog futures. Because he never knows when these ideas might come together to form a new idea" (von Oech, 1990, p. 6). On the other hand, it doesn't help that "Children enter school as question marks and leave as periods" (Neil Postman, cited in von Oech, 1990, p. 23). Therefore, it also helps to take advantage of others' curiosity. Perhaps we need a variant on The Book of Lists. As an example, consider a list of the multiple ways you can frame the relationship between two people: policeman/robber, parasite/host, husband/wife, mistress/ lover, master/slave, judge/accused, equal partners, brother/ sister, mother/child, organism/virus, etc., etc. As Checkland and Scholes point out, "this can get the thoughts moving." So can multiple ways of viewing, say, a professional football league: as pro viding entertainment; as providing opportunities for displays of tribal loyalty; as providing vicarious conflict; as enabling football skills to be refined; as enabling police to test crowd control skills; as pro viding data for the betting industry; and so on (Checkland and Scholes, 1990, pp. 32, 26). Gareth Morgan (1986) provides another and more fully developed list. In Images of Organization he proposes that organizations can be fruitfully viewed as any or all of the following: machines, organisms, brains, cultures, political systems, psychic prisons, flux and transformation, and instruments of domi nation. To note that Morgan's book can get the thoughts moving is truly an understatement. Consider another very short list. When addressing a problematic situation such as an argument, how do you choose to "represent" it? ? for it is your choice. By a war metaphor (Solve it!); a puzzle metaphor (Try to sort out what the problem is.); or as a chemical metaphor (This is a situation where ten sions and hatreds need to be dissolved.)?12</page><page sequence="8">250 Jonathan King In sum, much of the talk about "paradigms" these days frames the issue as if the problem is replacing an "old" paradigm with a "new" paradigm. This is misleading. Given the fact that our paradigms are always incomplete, the point of playing-with-para digms is the process of playing-with-paradigms. Tools as scripts While tools certainly function as instruments for getting things done ? such as playing-with-para digms functions to get the thoughts moving ? these are hardly the only ways that tools function. Tools also function as scripts. To take this added dimension of tools into account, let us modify the above diagram as follows: Exhibit II Paradigms-as-Tools "The map is imprinted by the territory" "In-Our-Minds" &lt;? "Out-There" It should come as no surprise that the vast majority of our "mental" models are not only in our heads, they are "out-there." Switching metaphors, we write our "software programs" then "hardwire" them out-there as tools. Therefore, one of the primary functions of tools is to serve as scripts: they "teach us" what to look for, and they tell us the form of solutions. In so doing, they not only function as blueprints from the past, they also symbolize the activities they enable. They instruct as to what the problem is and how it is to be dealt with. Consider a banal example. You are looking out over your very large backyard which is "telling" you it needs major work: (A) you have only a hoe in your hand or its image in your mind or (B) you have a 20 hp roto-tiller beside you or its image in your head. In a profound sense, these two scenarios "find you" involved in two very different realities. Note that the variable is the tool. The tool as symbol in all these respects thus transcends its role as a practical means towards certain ends . . . It must therefore inevitably enter into the individuals imaginative calculus that constantly constructs his world, (emphasis added) Joseph Weizenbaum, 1976. That tools function as scripts should hardly be a profound secret; we would still be in the Stone Ages if tools functioned only as "instruments" used by "rational actors" to achieve various ends. More to the point, we may very well find ourselves back in the Stone Ages if we persist in pretending that such tools as advanced generation computing systems are merely instruments ? the thrust of Weizenbaum's acclaimed book Computer Power and Human Reason. Our "objectified mental models" come in all shapes and sizes. These tools include our theories of the cosmos, of nature, and of ourselves. They include methods of inquiry such as analysis-into-parts and linear logics. In particular, our tools include lan guage with its metaphors and other figures of speech, value-loaded and more technical terms, words which symbolize profound meanings, etc., etc. The ways we organize ourselves also predeter mine most of what we are able to know. These tools include such prosaic "software programs" as machine tools and computer software programs, standard operating procedures and policies as well as rites, rituals, and ceremonies, accounting and performance appraisal measures, budgeting and planning proce dures, plant floor layouts and architectural designs, power structures and timeclocks, data bases, lists, multi-copy forms, forms themselves, etc., etc., etc. So far, so good. However, our objectified software programs cut both ways. They instruct us but they can also box us in. And this complicates matters. Getting people to play with paradigms is one thing; getting individuals, let alone organizations, to admit how they have been "boxing out" alternatives is quite another.</page><page sequence="9">Tools-A-Us 251 Learning how to unlearn: playing with paradigims If playing-with-paradigms can enhance learning, paradigms also have a second face: they can short circuit learning. In the case of our drunk, what if he "doesn't know that he doesn't know"? What if he "thinks" that he will eventually find his keys by con tinuing to diligently search under that same street light? J asked . . . "What do you worry about most on your job?" His answer was startling. "I worry most about what my people don't know that they don't know. What they know that they don't know, they're able to work on and find the answers to. But they can't do that if they don't know that they don't know." Stanley Davis, 1987. In and out of boxes To illustrate what it literally means to get caught in a box, consider the following puzzle. Connect all nine dots with four straight lines without lifting your pencil from the page. (Creative solutions such as very wide lines or lowering the page instead of lifting your pencil are not permitted.) Far more significant than the trouble most of us have dealing with this simple puzzle is how obvious the solution is once you see it. (Extend one of those lines outside the box you have unconsciously drawn around the perimeter of those nine dots.) Thus, the moral of the nine-dot puzzle is that the approach that works is to unlearn that mental model whose very definition of the problem constitutes the problem. The problem-solving strategy is not to solve the puzzle, it is to "think outside the box." For example, why do fewer than 10% of American corporations survive more than 20 years? According to Nystrom and Starbuck, the explanation is that managers get locked into "cognitive structures" (Nystrom and Starbuck, 1984). Fine. But most man agers aren't supid, so how do they allow themselves to get locked in? What are the boxing-out mechanisms! Granted, if one has a limited repertoire of tools, then it is hard to think and act in alternative ways. And granted, many of us are "too busy" to invest time developing lists of alternative mental models objectified as tools. And granted, many of us are loath to give up the various tools on which we were bred, fed, and wed. And granted many of us may have lost the curiosity we had as young kids. And granted, the priorities and performance reward systems of too many organizations hardly encourage taking "mental" risks. Coping with self-justifying processes These are all significant obstacles to learning how to unlearn. However, these obstacles pale by compari son to collapsing our awareness of the power of self justifying processes. The mechanisms of this circular logic include self-fulfilling prophecies ("See, I was right"), self-sealing or defensive systems ("I refuse to see how I might be wrong"), and self-referencing systems ("I cannot understand where you are coming from"). So, let's modify our simple model to illustrate circular logic. Exhibit III Tools-?-Us "The map is now the territory" "In-Our-Minds" = "Out-There" The dynamics seem simple enough: (1) we make a tool with the intended objective of achieving certain results based on some particular mental model at the time; (2) in symbolizing a now-objectified mental model, the tool-as-script then projects it back to us</page><page sequence="10">252 Jonathan King whenever we see it or use it; (3) we then map this reinforced "mental model" back onto whatever we think is going on out-there. In this circling process, our tools "tell us" what paradigms to use. They thereby "specify" the form of solutions for us, and, in so doing, they "inform us" what is of value. By then reenacting what they tell us, we reproduce them. We construct (not necessarily consciously) our reality, and then construct our response to that construction and so on into the future. Donald Michael, 1986. And round and round it goes. This circular logic is by no means limited to homeostatic or equili brating circles. The circling can and does turn every which way. More radically, change is not limited to, say, evolutionary processes; the processes of evolu tion can themselves evolve through recursive logics. This is circular logic with a vengeance and is prob ably a pretty good model for a great deal of what goes on in the world. Consider several significant examples. In each case, note the crucial dynamics of how we construct our realities, then construct our responses to our constructions, and so on into the future. An officially declared problem is the motivation of employees. This behaviorist "representation . . . specifies the form of solutions" in ways familiar to all of us: grades, annual performance reviews, incentive pay systems, and the like. So why did Peter Drucker recently opine that talking about motivating em ployees was immoral? The preferred interpretation is to plunge into the "ethical dilemmas" of justifiable manipulation; however, W. Edwards Deming pro poses a different interpretation. In pointing out that people really want to take pride and joy in their work, the problem is transformed into a challenge of not demotivating workers! In effect, that leaves us with all those motivational tools out there which keep "telling" managers to plan, organize, and control in ways that get workers to work. These motivational tools function as "scripts," but there is a kicker. What if you have to "motivate" employees because you have created a "system" where that is all that works? And so on into the future? It is a sobering experience to hear the CEO of Xerox admit that they had no idea of the extent to which their firm managed by fear. It is even more sobering to hear other CEOs of top American firms confirm W. Edwards Deming's dictum that "pro found knowledge must come from outside the system."13 Deming's dictum points to a more general problem: we always run risks when our theories of ourselves themselves become part of our realities. By reenacting what our theories tell us we are, we reconstruct ourselves accordingly on into the future. Such self-fulfilling prophecies then tempt us to take as given what was never given. As a second example, consider concerns expressed over the potentially self-justifying logics of Rational Choice Theory, including its recent extensions to organizations (Agency Theory) and political pro cesses (Public Choice Theory): If people are assumed to be motivated only by self interest, then an organization automatically develops a highly political style, with the result that people must continually look out for their self-interest in order to survive. (Senge, 1990, p. 274). Agency theorists . . . find much self-regarding behavior; they then assume that this is human nature . . . What they take for granted should be taken as a problem: why have we encouraged so much self-regarding behavior? (Perrow, 1986, pp. 234-5). For all these things to happen, a norm of public spirited ness in political action ? a view that people should not simply be selfish in their political behavior ? is crucial. The public choice school is part of the assault on that norm. (Kelman, 1987, p. 81). Finally, consider an anomaly that repeatedly crops up in econometric forecasting. It is an in-joke, of sorts, that econometricians "adjust" the outcomes of their models when their tools produce patently implausible results. However, such adjustments beg a rather large question: how do econometricians know when the outputs of their tools are plausible? What is going on here? Evidently, the implausible outputs don't "fit" whereas the plausible outputs "fit." Fit what? The representations, mental models, or paradigms in econometricians' "heads." Abductive logic provides distance from self-justifying circles If this is what is really going on, then the logic at</page><page sequence="11">Tools-A-Us 253 issue is neither deductive nor inductive, it is what Gregory Bateson (1971) termed "abductive" logic ? the logic of pattern recognition and pattern com parison. This logic is central to understanding what is termed "intuition" which has recently received increasing attention and acceptance, after many decades of being officially ignored . . . Experi enced managers and leaders rely heavily on . . . hunches, recognize patterns, and draw intuitive analogies and parallels to other seeming disparate situations (Senge, 1990, p. 168). Admitting the significance of "intuition," how ever, begs an even larger question. If "[t]he choice of problem representation is the job of the human programmer and is a creative act," then how do we human beings decide which representations of our worlds and of ourselves we human beings wish to create? This question gets to the crux of soft systems methodology, for it essentially demands rendering explicit what is tacit. With respect to the longstanding desire to predict the future, Donald Michael notes that Alternative choices of events, time periods, interpreta tions and intentions provide unnumbered ways to link past events to a present. And there are unnumbered ways of putting together the present, i.e., what is "really" happening and what is "really" important. Since the present is always constructed out of a presumed past, I have learned that thoughts about the future derive from preferred constructions of the present and of the past. These constructions are preferred because they are deemed "fitting" in that they seem, according to the prevailing social construction of reality and its cultural norms, to be sensible, familiar, logical, authoritative, or otherwise acceptable because one has participated in their creation (1985, pp. 95?6; emphasis added). Thus, Michael points out, "[w]e construct (not necessarily consciously) our reality, and then con struct our response to that construction ? and so on into the future." This, of course, is self-justification in action. Again, the point of learning how to unlearn by distancing ourselves from self-justifying circles is not to replace them with other self-justifying circles. Indeed, at some level we human beings arguably need some type of "self-evident" mythos. In this sense, self-justifying processes are neither inherently good or bad. Yet if we cannot predict the future or even possible futures, are we therefore condemned to playing games? When we forecast the future, are we condemned to the mere projection of our pre ferred pasts and presents into the future? Michael notes that forecasting must therefore really be: an aesthetic enterprise more than a logical one . . . [Yet] the authority of logic ... is what carries weight. This source of authority legitimizes the stories they tell. But the source also tends to subvert the storytellers' own recognition that they are telling stories . . . Their own belief in the authority of logic, leads them to believe they are doing something very different from "merely" telling stories (1985, p. 96).14 We have now gotten to the crux of dealing with the subjectivity which is the central characteristic of human affairs. In so doing, we illuminate a central dimension of smart business strategy these days. Above all, we open a door to exerting moral control over our very powerful new toys. Evaluating self-justification What difference does it make if we explicitly tell stories about our futures? What difference does it make if we pursue the implications that "we dream in narrative, day-dream in narrative, remember, anticipate, hope, despair, believe, doubt, plan, revise, criticize, construct, gossip, learn, hate and love by narrative" (Maclntyre, 1981, p. 211)? The first payoff from spinning alternative tales ? what Dutch Royal/Shell planners term alternative "scenarios" ? is that we stand a good chance of revealing some of our "boxes."15 We thereby stand a better chance of being prepared for the unexpected. Alternatively, by explicitly trying to project ourselves into the future, aware that we need to also look backward, visualizing enables us to ask ourselves how we should operate and organize ourselves better rather than unwittingly allowing our current meth ods and modes of organizing to "tell" us what the future holds.16 Kenichi Ohmae (1990) hammers home one varia tion of this insight: focusing on beating the competi tion is a strategic mistake in today's global economy. W. Edwards Deming offers another: managing by objectives or results is like driving a car by looking in</page><page sequence="12">254 Jonathan King the rearview mirror. Visualizing alternative futures through telling stories or creating scenarios are "soft" methods for transcending the status quo. Second and more significant, by telling stories we explicitly confront the purposes or values which are otherwise implicit or hidden away in all of our tools, including our theories of ourselves and especially our methodologies. Thus, this helps crack the "authoritative logics" of a good many experts in their roles as institutionalized tools. More generally, the unique strength of the narrative method derives from the structure of stories: stories presuppose a beginning, middle, and end which are all of one piece, the one leading necessarily to the next. Indi viduals, organizations, or nations who are not in volved in stories are dangerously and essentially adrift. Third and perhaps most important, taking stories seriously is a soft strategy for transcending those circles we get caught up in. By telling alternative stories we explicitly open up the possibility of dis cussing together the kinds of future we wish to create.17 Thus, rather than striving to predict what we think will happen, rather than unwittingly pro jecting "preferred" pasts and presents into the future, we now face the possibility of participating in the creation of our futures by creating various representations of thatfuture. An alternative is to have our various tools per form this crucial function for us. However, this strategy is tantamount to decisions-by-default and is an increasingly risky "copout" in our modern tech nological society. It therefore behooves us to start paying attention to the big, basic issue of Tools-&gt;9-Us as we plunge into the brave new worlds of computer enhanced virtual realities, genetically engineered human beings, neuro-chemically enhanced brains, and molecular-sized engines of creation. The alternative may indeed be a future that is both exciting and short. Conclusion [The systems-approach of the "second genera tion"] should be based on a model of planning as an argumentive process in the course of which an image of the problem and of the solution emerges gradually among the participants, as a product of incessant judgment, subjected to critical argument (Rittel and Weber, 1973, p. 162). We are exceedingly vulnerable to the onslaught of powerful new technologies to the degree that we allow our powerful new toys to become self-justify ing. Our predominant epistemology provides such self-justifications through an instrumental ration ality which beggars our understandings of what it means to be morally responsible. By contrast, playing-with-paradigms helps us to both learn and unlearn through explicitly comparing alternative representations of thinking and acting. However, to guard against the dangers of Tools-&gt;3 Us, we also need to understand how our tools-as scripts transcend their role as "instruments" ? as merely practical means towards various ends. In turn, this requires realizing how our tools can become self-justifying, hence beyond our moral control, through circular logics such as self-fulfilling prophecies. The crux of the matter is to learn how to deal rigorously with the subjectivity which is the crucial characteristic of human affairs. Much that is hap pening in our on-going epistemological evolution, especially the systems approach of the "second gen eration," provides the basis for such a soft systems methodology. However, every methodology has its "ground rules" and soft systems methodology is no exception. Because the aim of this methodology is that "an image of the problem and of the solution emerges gradually among the participants, as a product of incessant judgment, subjected to critical argument," soft systems methodology entails a crucial role for such "old-fashioned" virtues as compassion, integ rity, honesty, and fairness. These virtues are not merely "factors in decision making," they are the sine qua non for the continual improvement of the processes of our minds ? more precisely, our institu tionalized minds.18 Epilogue ? on methodology There are longstanding and continuing controversies over the degree to which the methods of the natural</page><page sequence="13">Tools-A-Us 255 sciences can and ought to be applied to human beings. In the first half of this century, logical positivism appeared to be gaining ground. During the last several decades, matters have become more confused and confusing. It may seem to an uninstructed outsider that. . . to have a physics freed of anthropomorphism is sensible enough, but that a human science similarly purified would be a kind of contradiction . . . In the last analysis, I believe that the unsophisticated outsider turns out to be right. Charles Taylor, 1980, Charles Taylor (1980), a leading exponent of the view that there are fundamental methodological differences between the natural and human sciences, underscores the purposiveness ? what he terms the "desirability characteristics" ? inherent to under standing human beings. A more radical position, exemplified by "radical hermeneutics," is the polar opposite of logical positivism. On this view, the methods of the natural and human sciences are both inescapably interpretive (see Bernstein, 1983). These arguments and counter-arguments have long assumed that the fundamental issue is onto logical (the nature of "reality"). Thus, moral issues are assumed to be secondary or derived from more foundational understandings of the nature of reality. Richard Rorty offers an alternative perspective on methodologies which mirrors the central concerns of this paper: The . . . view I want to suggest [sees] no ontological break between human and non-human reality, but only ... a moral break. This seems to me the only sort of break we need, and that it does not need to be "grounded" on some more fundamental "metaphysical" or "methodological" distinction (Rorty, 1980, p. 46). Put bluntly, if and when we judge it important to study ourselves as "objects," then we can and should use the methods of the natural sciences with their root mechanistic metaphors. If and when we judge it important to study ourselves as "functions," then we can and should use the methods of "hard systems" with their root biological metaphors. If and when we judge it important to study ourselves studying our selves, then we can and should use the methods of hermeneutics with their root interpretive metaphors. This means that our choices of methodologies ought to be based on "an argumentative process" which is "subject to incessant judgment." This process essen tially aims at rendering explicit our choices of what we view as important in a problematic situation rather than having a particular methodology "tell us" what is important in any problematic situation. This level of moral inquiry therefore presupposes certain ground rules such as compassionate learning and know thyself (see Michael, 1984). These are the ground rules for agreeing to try to agree over what we choose to be important. Restating the concern of this paper, a big, basic issue confront us in our modern technological society is the degree to which we are being "instructed" by an objectifying methodology which presupposes that efficiency and control are of paramount importance. One name for this objectifying methodology is "instrumental rationality." Hannah Arendt's more disturbing term is "the rule of Nobody." My name for this potentially self-justifying methodology is "Tools-?-Us." If we choose such moral instructions to be appro priate, so be it. But these choices ought to be made explicitly, not made by default. Doing this requires that we stand back and critically examine together what we are being "told" is important by our tools. In particular, it requires rendering explicit what we are implicitly commanded to choose as important by our dominant ways of speaking, our dominant methods of inquiry, and our dominant modes of organizing ourselves. By contrast, here is a pretty typical way of avoid ing this level of moral inquiry. Sitting on a Ph.D. committee discussing a disser tation on machine learning strategies, I interrupted with a question: "Do we really want to build such machines?" There was a prolonged and embarrassed silence which I broke, saying, "Sorry, let's continue the previous discussion." The problem, it appears, is that asking such questions was not in any of their job descriptions. Now who ? or what ? told them that? The assumption current in all modern legal systems [is] that intent to do wrong is necessary for the commission of a crime. . . [However], politics is not like the nursery; in politics obedience and support are the same. Hannah Arendt, 1963.</page><page sequence="14">256 Jonathan King Notes 1 This paper elaborates concerns expressed in King (1993) by presenting concrete suggestions on how people can cope with what currendy are perceived as unsolvable "messes" in our technological society. 2 See Dixit and Nalebuff s Thinking Strategically: The Com petitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life (1991) for one of the better books on game theory. However, its radical limitations appear in the context of the next two big, basic issues. 3 Charles Perrow's Normal Accidents (1984) is one of the better examples of applied general systems theory. See Reason (1990) for a succinct overview. 4 It is instructive that Weizenbaum (1976) devotes the first chapter of his acclaimed book to the multiple functions of tools. 5 See Perrow (1986), esp. pp. 232-233; Douglas (1986); and Senge (1990), esp. pp. 274?86. Jon Elster's seminal argu ments are more complex for they are presented in the lan guage of rational choice theory. For an excellent overview, see Mongin (1990), in particular, his conclusion that Elster's critique necessarily leads to issues of moral philosophy. 6 See Charles Taylor (1980) for an outstanding analysis of fundamental differences between the natural and human sciences and, in particular, the crucial issue of whether using "objective" terms to understand "subjective" experience is adequate. 7 What follows elaborates the core concepts common to all "general systems theorists." For a succinct summary, see Checkland and Scholes (1990, p. 19). 8 Checkland and Scholes' term for stories is "purposive holons" ? i.e., the story forms a narrative "whole" informed by a logic of "purpose." For a more extended analysis of the significance of stories, see Alasdair Maclntyre (1981), esp. Ch. 15, "The Virtues, the Unity of a Human Life and the Concept of a Tradition." 9 Abbott's term, the "stochastic view," refers to causal explanation. Causal explanations seek to identify indepen dent variables (main effects) that hold across all cases (e.g., individuals). Narrative explanations seek to identify patterns of particular values of variables (interaction effects) that hold along particular cases. 10 For some radical extensions of this insight, see Morgan (1986), Chapter 8, "Unfolding Logics of Change." More ex tensive elaborations are found in Edelman (1987), Maturana and V?rela (1980), and B?hm (1980). 11 For an elaboration, see Karl Weick's "Enactment and Organizing" in The Social Psychology of Organizing (1979) as well as his "Enacted Sensemaking in Crisis Situations," Journal of Management Studies 25 (July 1988): 305-317. 12 See Lakoff and Johnson's (l 980) discussion of these three metaphors in Chapter 21, "New Meaning." 13 These observations came from the recent PBS special, The Deming of America. 14 Note Abbott's strikingly similar claim: "Yet careful read ing shows that the language of 'variables causing things' is merely a shorthand; stochastic writers fall back on stories or 'plausible mechanisms,' when they must defend or support particular assertions about the variables. Narrative is the fundamental recourse" (Abbott, 1990, p. 143). 15 In particular, see Peter Senge's ( 1990) Chapter 17, "Micro worlds: The Technology of the Learning Organization." 16 See Stanley Davis (1987) for an elaboration of this strategy. 17 This process is the crux of Habermas' concept of the "ideal speech community." For a brief overview of this concept, see Kurtines, Alvarez, and Azmitia (1990). 18 Donald Michael's essay ends with two crucial morals ? "compassionate learning" and "Know thyself." More gener ally, ethicist Michael Josephson recently asserted before a group of 500 public sector managers that these four virtues are not "factors in decision making" but are "the ground rules" tout simple. For a more extended argument on the significance of such virtues, see Maclntyre's After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory (1981).
