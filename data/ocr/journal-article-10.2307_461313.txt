<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WRECK OF THE DEUTSCHLAND: A NEW READING BY ELISABETH W. SCHNEIDER FOR A LONG TIME, the luxuriance of ba- roque imagery so conspicuous in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins has tended to obscure one of its fundamental characteristics. His is a poetry of statement, intellectually formulated even when at emotional white heat, and scarcely at all, in any usual sense, poetry of suggestion or atmosphere. He could not have permitted him- self to write otherwise even if he had wished, and he did not wish. Though obviously the poetry does not lie in the statement-he himself was explicit about this'-still, when he found that even Robert Bridges had continual difficulty in making out his literal meaning, he resolved, he said, "to prefix short prose arguments" to some of his work. "These too," he added, "will expose me to carping, but I do not mind."2 Hopkins' writing was contemporary with that of the French Symbolists (he was born in the same year as Verlaine), and both he and they were bringing something fresh to the language and rhythms of poetry. But there is no evidence that he was aware of their work, or of French Impressionist painting either, for all his lively interest in the art of his day; and in method he and they were as far apart as can be imagined. Hopkins' aim was nearly opposite to that im- plied in Mallarme's dictum, "nommer un objet c'est supprimer les trois quarts de la jouissance du poeme . . . le suggerer voila le reve." His effort was to name, to pin down with the utmost precision, the individual thing of which there could be no duplicate, the distinctive pattern and design that made the living individual or the natural scene unique; and his roots were all native. The precepts of Ruskin's Modern Paint- ers had recently opened the eyes of many Eng- lishmen, and Hopkins' drawings, both of archi- tectural subjects and of nature, were avowedly "Ruskinese" (Letters, iii, 202). The spirit of Ruskin's chapters on "truth of clouds," "truth of water," "truth of foliage" and branch and twig is present everywhere in the detailed ob- servations of nature recorded in his journals and poetry, as well as in the attention to both detail and design in his drawings. In no sense did he write symbolist poetry or the verbal equivalent of "mood music," though in their passionate exactitude his language and imagery are often supralogical, addressing themselves directly to the sensual imagination. His structure, however, is always logically conceived; its rigid severity suggests mediaeval Aristotelian thought more nearly than poetic imagination. Like the temperament from which it sprang, however, his is a poetry of extremes, distin- guished on the one hand, as most critics have observed, by passionate sensuousness reminis- cent of Keats-a love of the richest colors, tastes, physical beauty, sensation of all kinds-and on the other by an equally urgent desire for law, rigid control-by asceticism in fact. Willfulness, then, and an impulse towards extreme license are set against the bent towards self-denial and utter subjection of the will. In his life the ex- tremes were perhaps rarely at peace; in his poetry at its best they are reconciled, and much of the individuality of his work derives from the tension so created. Something resembling this kind of opposition naturally underlies any poetic organization and not Hopkins' only, being in fact present wherever form is imposed. In such a writer as Keats, however, the control is felt to be no more than the normal human love of order at work in creating aesthetic form; there is no tinge of asceticism in it. Hopkins, in whom the ascetic was so strong, as a poet transformed this into a positive power over form, but his form carries the marks of its particularly intense origin. Both form and language are therefore paradoxically on the one hand severe and on the other wayward, extravagant, sometimes out- landish. A single descriptive epithet may be both willfully odd and determinedly subjected to literal fact, his grammar and idiom eccentric and yet precisely explicable by rule or precedent, the thought of a poem eccentrically conceived but developed on a rigidly logical plan. In both its successes and its sometimes embarrassing failures, Hopkins' poetry owes much of its peculiarly explosive character to these opposi- tions inherent in the detail as well as the whole design of nearly every work.

Schneider r 11 able studies that have appeared in recent years in consequence of which it has ceased to be quite the fearsome dragon Bridges once thought it, there remain certain things to be said about Hopkins' longest poem. The Wreck of the Deutschland is beginning to take its place in the company of the great English odes and elegies. It is not a flawless poem, but we are coming to see it as unmistakably a great one. It is also something of a miracle, for its success is won against every probability. Given all that it at- tempts and given the intractable, unmastered emotion that went into it, it should have been doomed from the start to failure. The whole undertaking presents itself as a piece of reckless daring, and the poem lays a teasing claim upon our interest, therefore, as an almost unheard of kind of success. However much its remarkable language may obscure the fact and however complex its final effect may be, the Wreck, like every other com- pleted poem of Hopkins, is extremely simple, not to say also rigid, diagrammatic, in its primary structure. The naked skeleton is not particularly beautiful and its character is likely to be un- congenial to modern readers, but the skeleton alone gives coherence to the parts, and it alone makes intelligible the shape and proportions of the whole. It therefore needs to be set forth as clearly as possible. Stated baldly, the poem is an ode on conver- sion-conversion to the Catholic Church. As Hopkins reminded Bridges, it is an ode, not a narrative; the wreck of the German liner which provides the title is the occasion, not the theme. The poem is in two parts, a mode of thought that in Hopkins seems to have deep roots if one recalls its almost constant appearance in his work. The main theme of Part the First is his own conversion; that of Part the Second, the hoped-for conversion of all England, of which cer- tain events connected with the shipwreck are con- ceived as the spark and the signal.3 Within the limits of its bare thematic frame, however, Hopkins explicitly or by implication crowded nearly everything in life about which he felt deeply. Reading the poem, one has the feeling that, his poetic pen licensed after a decade of largely self-imposed silence, he was writing as if he might never again be free to write and must set down in this one work all that remained to him of value and hope on earth. It is not a prom- ising prospect, for the control of so much in- tensely felt and apparently disparate material would seem to pose insuperable difficulties. Among Hopkins' most abiding hopes and deepest longings was the wish that England might become Catholic, not in some remote future time, but soon, or now. To a degree this was natural, especially for a convert; and for a young man whose last experience of secular life had been the Oxford of the fifties or sixties with conversions and rumors of conversion still a matter of high excitement, the possibility need not have seemed altogether absurd. Hopkins would not have forgotten what he had written to Newman while still at Oxford, when four friends had taken the step almost simultane- ously, "All our minds you see were ready to go at a touch and it cannot but be that the same is the case with many here" (Letters, iII, 30). The hope did not die easily: as late as 1881, knowing well how hostile Bridges would be to the thought, Hopkins was nevertheless impelled to write to him of the approaching three-hundredth an- niversary of the martyrdom of Edmund Cam- pion, "from which I expect of heaven some, I cannot guess what, great conversion or other blessing to the Church in England" (Letters, i, 135-136). On this occasion too he was under- taking to write an ode, in a vein "something be- tween the Deutschland and Alexander's Feast." The basis of Hopkins' longing for others' con- version, however, was personal as well as re- ligious, and the intensity of the personal feeling undoubtedly affected his rational judgment. He had been one of a close and congenial family, and the shock of his conversion and dedication to the priesthood brought grief to all, including him- self; though superficial friendliness was preserved by an effort on both sides, the old intimacy was broken for good. A similar barrier had fallen between himself and certain of his dearest friends. Sensitive and dependent on affection, the happiness of sharing his love of natural beauty, poetry, painting, and high thoughts with family and friends suddenly gone, Hopkins was a lonely, sometimes desperately lonely, man. No new human ties took the place of the old ones, for he did not transfer affections easily and the companions of his new life shared few of his ' This must be the essential parallel upon which the poem is founded and not, as some writers have suggested, one between the poet's experience and that of a nun drowned in the dis- aster, for the latter resemblance is too slightly sketched and embraces too little of the poem to be more than incidental; taken as a structural theme it leaves out most of the poem. For an instance of that view, however, see Robert R. Boyle's discussion of the poem in Immortal Diamond, ed. Norman Weyand (New York, 1949), especially pp. 335,339.</page><page sequence="3">112 "The Wreck of the Deutschland" intellectual interests or tastes. As he was fully committed to his adopted religion, nothing short of a general movement of conversion in England could reunite him to those he loved; nothing less could heal the breach within himself that re- mained a source of the pain described in a sonnet of the next decade: To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life Among strangers. Father and mother dear, Brothers and sister are in Christ not near And he my peace my parting, sword and strife. England, whose honour 0 all my heart woos, wife To my creating thought, would neither hear Me, were I pleading, plead nor do I: . . . 4 His letters show an almost pathetic effort to grasp at whatever common interests could still be shared without stirring bitter depths. The stanzas of the Wreck having to do directly with the conversion of England are marked by a personal intensity over and above the natural desire of even an ardent Christian for the salva- tion of his fellowmen; and the forced significance which he read into one event of the wreck is accountable, biographically if not historically or aesthetically, on the same ground. A life-long interest in shipwrecks remained one thing that he could still share with his family. Wrecks, it will be remembered, were a material part of the business of his father, who as head of a firm of marine average adjusters not only wrote technical works on marine insurance but, only a short time before the Deutschland's disaster, had published The Port of Refuge, or Advice and Instructions to the Master-Mariner in Situations of Doubt, Difficulty, and Danger (1873), a book practical in purpose but adorned with quotations from The Ancient Mariner and the occasional purple phrases of a man who would have liked to be a poet (and who in fact did try). The whole family seem to have been a company of horrified amateurs of maritime disaster, too high-minded to rejoice in others' misfortune but vividly interested. Hopkins' brother Arthur exhibited at the Royal Academy paintings inspired by shipwrecks; and, for a landsman's, Gerard's own poetry is surprisingly full of images and symbols-nearly always highly charged with feeling-derived from wrecks, often in the most unlikely contexts. It is not by accident that in his earliest known school- boy poem religious martyrdom and imagery of shipwreck are brought together in a passage strongly tinged by masochistic feeling: the "poor collapsing frame" of the saint-whose "crack'd flesh lay hissing on the grate"-"hung like a wreck that flames not billows beat." Nor is it by chance that in the late "Heraclitean" sonnet the second turn is marked by the words "Across my foundering deck shone / A beacon, an eternal beam" (Poems, pp. 14, 112). When the Deutschland was lost, his mother sent Gerard newspaper clippings describing the event, which, he told her, had made a deeper impression on him than "any other wreck or accident" he had ever read of (Letters, ii, 135). It was a disaster that for personal reasons, therefore, touched him more closely than it did most Englishmen. It stirred the rest of England too, however, with an uncommon shock of guilt, for the liner had run aground near the mouth of the Thames not far from shore, its distress signals had been seen, yet no attempt at rescue had been made for some thirty crucial hours; and subsequently the vessel was looted by the owners of local fishing smacks who, it was said, even tore rings from the fingers of dead bodies aboard. This was an ugly record for the English with their national pride in maritime competence and in certain kinds of human decency. The inquest and a local inquiry were followed by a full-dress admiralty investigation, and the sense of national guilt was voiced in more than one Times editorial con- cerned with the "painful surprise" and "shame" with which the nation learned "that a wreck could be stranded off the English coast, appeal- ing to English sailors for aid, and for thirty hours should be left without that aid."5 "It is shame- ful," the same editorial said further, "that where men were found in considerable numbers thus bold enough to defy the law [i.e., the pillaging smacksmen] there were none found daring enough to risk anything for the sake of saving life." The disaster was thus felt by others besides Hopkins as something of a public moral crisis, and it might therefore without overstraining be looked upon as an event of spiritual significance, though few would have read into it all that Hopkins did. As the cause of the wreck itself, however, lay not in man but in nature, the blinding winter storm that drove the vessel off course, there was implicit in the event the question of cosmic justice, the old crucial problem for the Christian of explaining the suffering of the innocent and particularly such suffering as appears to be 4Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed.

Schneider 113 caused by nature, not by fallen man himself. This relation of the natural to the moral world was an issue sharpened in Hopkins' day by the impact of the Darwinian doctrine of the struggle for existence, with "nature red in tooth and claw." For Hopkins personally nature presented another problem of deep concern, that of rec- onciling his strong emotional attachment to the physical beauty of the world with the claims of the spirit, a problem that reduced itself to the simple question of whether he might not be guilty of loving material nature too passionately and too much for the sake of beauty itself (during one spring he seems to have deprived himself of the sight of nature as a penance). On a theological plane both these problems had recently been resolved for him by a doctrine he had found in the writings of Duns Scotus. All this, including the doctrine itself, went into the Wreck of tke Deutsch- land. Then there was the matter of miracles. Hop- kins was not among the Victorian Christians who found them a stumbling block in the way of belief. On the contrary, not only did Biblical and the early saints' miracles move him deeply, but he also eagerly sought reasons to believe any accounts of contemporary miraculous healing or other miraculous signs of grace, and these appear often to have been associated in his mind with the conversion of England. Miracles enter promi- nently into the Deutschland, and the whole poem really turns on the hint of a miraculous presence through which the wreck and the conversion of England are brought within a single focus. This is a great deal for a man to dare combine in one ode, particularly when it is all felt with somewhat abnormal personal intensity: the cen- tral spiritual event of his own life, his hope for "rare-dear" England, the shipwreck with both its public and its personal significance, the sug- gestion of a new miracle, the Scotist doctrine of the Incarnation, the reconciliation of evil and suffering in the world with the Christian belief in an all-powerful, all-wise, all-good God. And then there was the final daring of the form. In the Wreck Hopkins experimented for the first time with his new sprung rhythm and, to increase the difficulty immeasurably, invented for it a new stanza, one of the most complicated ever em- ployed in English verse. No one, it would seem, in his right mind would experiment with such form on such material; few would attempt to cope with the material even in a simple or estab- lished form.6 All this is what I meant by saying earlier that the poem succeeds-supposing that it does-against all probability. Almost phenom- enal technical skill was required and extraor- dinary control over the refractory and too in- tense emotional material. Both skill and control, particularly the latter, break down occasionally; the absence of distancing and failure of judgment are felt here and there, somewhat as they are in Adonais and for not altogether dissimilar rea- sons. To return, however, to the skeleton of thought, which has yet to be traced at its literal level. The two divisions of the poems are unequal, the autobiographical first part being appropriately shorter but still parallel, serving as microcosm, prelude, and in a sense pattern to Part the Second, with the implication that what has hap- pened in one soul may happen in all. The poem opens with a solemn stanza ad- dressed to God Omnipotent, lord of all living and dead, of land and sea, of the speaker himself- God omnipotent to create and destroy: Thou mastering me God! giver of breath and bread; World's strand, sway of the sea; Lord of living and dead; Thou hast bound bones and veins in me, fastened me flesh, And after it almost unmade, what with dread, Thy doing: and dost thou touch me afresh? Over again I feel thy finger and find thee. The imagery is universal and would be appropri- ate to any poetic acknowledgment of the power of God; at the same time it is deliberately bent toward the particular circumstances so as to sum up much of the poem, living and dead, land and sea foreshadowing the shipwreck on a sandbank as well as embracing all the earth and mankind, and the personal "mastering me" in the first line, which I take to be a deliberate alteration of "masterful" or "all-mastering," signaling at the outset the personal direction of Part I.7 The last line, with its anthropomorphic image and ap- parent but not real tautology, is a specific theo- logical statement illumined by Hopkins' own commentary on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, where the "finger" of God is explained as symbolizing God's power exerted on the ex- 6 See my article "Sprung Rhythm: A Chapter in the Evolu- tion of Nineteenth-Century Verse," PMLA, LXXX (June 1965), 237-253. 7 I read the line without a stress on me--"Thoiu mastering- me / Gcd " (differing in this from Gardner, Poems, p. 22 1)- taking mastering me as a single proclitic epithet of God, the equivalent of masterful or overmastering, made personal for the sake of the theme of Part i.</page><page sequence="5">114 "The Wreck of the Deutschland" ternal world of matter-here, of course, the wreck-as distinguished from "thee," the very Self of God, God as love.8 As the oracular tone changes to a more per- sonal one in what follows, the sprung rhythm falls away into conventional and soon predominantly anapestic meter with only an occasional sprung foot. In this rhythm the account proceeds of the poet's conversion, or at least of a crucial moment connected with it, a decisive night of violent spiritual terror and suffering that ended with the free choice of his heart, responding to God's grace. The moment of choice is summed up in the somewhat mannered "To flash from the flame [of hell] to the flame [of Christ or the Holy Spirit] then, tower from the grace to the grace," a line that illustrates Hopkins' not always happy efforts to render theology in poetical terms. Poetically there is probably no value in our knowing pre- cisely what the two kinds of grace are; it is, however, well to know that they are doctrinal and definite, not vague or mystical; they are ex- plicitly distinguished in his prose meditations (Devotional Writings, pp. 154-158). The resolu- tion of this crisis is succeeded by a spiritual serenity which is the subject of the beautiful "hourglass and well" stanza: I am soft sift In an hourglass-at the wall Fast, but mined with a motion, a drift, And it crowds and it combs to the fall; I steady as a water in a well, to a poise, to a pane, But roped with, always, all the way down from the tall Fells or flanks of the voel, a vein Of the gospel proffer, a pressure, a principle, Christ's gift. This is the serenity of Dante's "Our peace in His will" or of the prayer in Ash Wednesday, "Teach us to care and not to care," here symbolized in images that reconcile stillness and motion-still- ness in the willing renunciation of individual will, and motion, the willing response to God's will-with the profound peace of this reconcili- ation. So the "soft sift" of the quiescent soul is motionless at the wall of the hourglass but at the center "crowds" and "combs" (like an inbound comber on the shore) in willing motion to fulfill its destined function, the telling of time. And the spirit is confidently quiet like the water in a'clear well, yet not stagnant but marked by motion from the inflow of mountain springs, "Christ's gift," that perpetually feed it. (The well is not named in the poem but the image is of a par- ticular sacred well, that of St. Winefred at Holy- well, the scene of a series of reputed miraculous cures, including a recent one that had particu- larly interested Hopkins.) Though parallel and similar in drift, the two images of the stanza are not redundant, for though both represent the will as at once active and passive, motion in the hourglass image implies the spending of self, that in the well renewal. The essence of the whole passage is the serenity of a dedication that has followed upon the agonizing choice of the pre- ceding stanzas.9 The doctrinal substance of that serenity is the subject of the next several stanzas. First it is given in emotional terms: the poet accepts and in- deed welcomes not only the stars of the world but the storms, the beauty, and the terror. The first comes naturally, "I kiss my hand to the stars," from which the spirit of Christ is easily felt to be wafted; the other is achieved through accep- tance by faith of the Christian mystery (by "mystery," Hopkins once explained to Bridges, a Catholic does not mean "an interesting uncer- tainty" but "an incomprehensible certainty"). The great mystery significant for the circum- stances of the poem is not Christ's relation to stars (beauty)-that the devout man feels with- out effort-but to storms, the suffering at- tributable in naturalistic terms not to man's sin but to the constitution of the external world. I kiss my hand To the stars, lovely-asunder Starlight, wafting him out of it; and Glow, glory in thunder; Kiss my hand to the dappled-with-damson west: Since, tho' he is under the world's splendour and wonder, His mystery must be instressed, stressed; For I greet him the days I meet him, and bless when I understand. (Stanza 5) Another extremely mannered line here, the seventh, I take to mean simply what has been said above: though Christ is (i.e., is naturally felt to be) under the world's splendor (the stars), 8 The Sermons and Devotional Writings of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed. Christopher Devlin (London, 1959), pp. 175, 195 (hereafter referred to as Devotional Writings). 9 F. R. Leavis (New Bearings in English Poetry, London, 1942, pp. 179-180),mistakenly, I think, sees the two images in this much-discussed stanza as symbolizing two successive and contrasting experiences. John E. Keating also reads it differently, finding "ironic humor" in the image of the steady water (The Wreck of the Deutscldand: An Essay and Com- mentary, Research Ser. vi, Kent State Univ., Kent, Ohio, 1963, pp. 50-61). Still another interpretation is offered by Gardner (Poems, p. 222) and a fuller version of my own in MLN, Lxv (1950), 306-311.</page><page sequence="6">Elisabetk W. Schneider 115 His mystery also (the storms) must be instressed (scored in upon ourselves, dwelt upon inwardly) when stressed (by storm) in the natural world. Stressed in this reading is simply the equivalent of an elliptical clause, a common enough con- struction, which elsewhere as well as here Hop- kins employed in eccentric ways.'0 In the stanzas that follow, the intellectual foundation of the poet's serenity is presented through a cryptic summary of the Scotist doc- trine of the Incarnation, which provided the reconciliation of "stars and storms," "lightning and love" that met Hopkins' personal need. He seems to suggest that Scotus' heart, like his own, must have been "at bay," needing this particular truth so desperately that the very need generated its intuitive discovery. Briefly and somewhat crudely summed up, the doctrine held that the Incarnation was not a consequence of the Fall and so not primarily a sacrifice to redeem man but that in some sense it pre-existed, that it is in fact coeval with time itself and hence with mate- rial creation. In this sense the Incarnation rides the whole course of time "like riding a river"; it is not confined to the historical life of Jesus how- ever central that may be to Christianity, is not a moment in the stream of time but rides that cur- rent from beginning to end. As Hopkins re- phrased the doctrine in his meditations, the "first intention" of God outside Himself, the "first outstress" of His power, was Christ, who went forth from God "not only in the eternal and in- trinsic procession of the Trinity but also by an extrinsic and less than eternal, let us say aeonian one." He added, significantly, "It is as if the bliss- ful agony or stress of selving in God had forced out drops of sweat or blood, which drops were the world." The created world, therefore (I over- simplify, omitting discussion of Lucifer's place in all this), by virtue of its origin "is marked every- where with the confusion, clashing, and wreck which took place in the higher one. . ." (Devo- tional Writings, pp. 196-202). What this comes to-a commonplace, but not of orthodox theol- ogy-is that storms as well as stars are part of the essential constitution of matter, antedating not only the fall but even the creation of man, and further, that they are intimately bound up with the sacrificial Incarnation from the begin- ning of time. This is a very different view of crea- tion from the usual Thomist one, and it is the doctrine expressly but elliptically asserted in the sixth and seventh stanzas of the poem. "Few know this," the poet says parenthetically, for the Scotist doctrine was not generally accepted though it had never been declared heretical and so was not forbidden to a Catholic: concerning it therefore "the faithful waver" (i.e., remain un- decided, differ among themselves), while the faithless "fable and miss" altogether. The truth comes home to all sometime, and when it does so it penetrates the whole being like the physical shudder produced by a sudden sour-sweet taste (Stanza 8). This Scotist doctrine, with its undeniably masochistic implications, had found immediate response in the corresponding temperament of Hopkins. To conceive Christ's sacrificial in- carnation, as well as the concomitant "storms" of nature, not as solely redemptive of man and therefore not as spiritually practical or func- tional for man's good but rather as free supernat- ural sacrifice for its own sake, is to conceive both sacrifice and storms as exquisite, to be rejoiced in for themselves (not simply endured for the good they may be thought to produce), the pleasure- in-pain sour-sweet of the sloe raised to the highest pitch of emotional and spiritual intensity. The 10 One might not hazard this reading if the poet were any other than Hopkins-but of course no other poet would have written the line, whatever the meaning. Instressed and stressed in this passage are usually taken to be grammatically parallel, but to read them so seems to me to produce a mean- ingless tautology as well as a feeble and pointless anticlimax uncharacteristic of Hopkins. By mere assertion John Pick tries to make a virtue of what I can see only as a defect: "The impact," he says, "is heightened by the reversal of the ex- pected word order" (Gerard Manley Hopkins, Priest and Poet, London, 1942, p. 44 n.). Cf. the discussion of this in Gardner's Gerard Manley Hopkins, 2 vols. (New Haven, 1948-49), i, 56-57, and the extended discussion by Boyle (Immortal Diamond, pp. 343-348), which I find equally unsatisfactory. The natural reading seems to me the one I have given, and it is quite in keeping with Hopkins' practice of taking accepted idioms or constructions and stretching them slightly beyond their ordinary use. The employment of a participle as the equivalent of an elliptical clause is common, though it more often precedes than follows the main statement (e.g., "Planted early enough, the seed will sprout in May," but also, "This will grow indoors, given plenty of sun"). Hopkins used it a number of times elsewhere: "clouds ... / Shew brighter shaken in Pemmaen Pool" (Poems, p. 68, the poem written immediately after the Deutschland), more eccentri- cally in "After-comers cannot guess the beauty been" (ibid., p. 83) and "nor he for his bones risen" (ibid., p. 75). It is impracticable here to enter into the general question of Hopkins' use of the word instress. I cannot avoid the suspi- cion that it meant different things at different times (see the indexes of Letters, i and ia, Journals, and [incomplete] Devo- tional Writings; also Letters, III, 446). Most important studies of Hopkins contain discussions of the term. In the present passage, however, the meaning seems plainly the same as in one of his notes of meditation where it is explicitly defined, "This song of Lucifer's was a dwelling on his own beauty, an instressing of his own inscape" (Devotional Writings, pp. 200-201).</page><page sequence="7">116 "The Wreck of the Deutschland" image is exact though I should think to most people somewhat repellent. This doctrine, then, in conjunction with the related Scotist theory of the constitution of matter, which, in addition to accounting most satisfactorily for "storms," gave to nature an altogether higher place than it holds in Thomist thought and which thus might afford spiritual sanction to the peculiar intensity of Hopkins' love of nature, underlay the serenity and peace of the sifting sand in the hour- glass and of the water in the sacred well, for it answered to several needs and brought them into harmony: sensuous love of nature, ecstatic as- ceticism, and the need for an orderly logical framework. The progression of thought, then, if not the thought itself, in these central stanzas of Part i is rational and simple: first there is the spiritual crisis, then the choice, the serenity following the choice, and the main emotional, followed by the doctrinal, basis of that serenity. Part the First then closes the chapter of spiritual autobiography with two stanzas addressed, like the opening of the poem, to God, but with the stars and storms now reconciled; the poet prays that all men may be brought to God whether by violence as in the conversion of Paul-and of himself as he has been describing it-or gently as with St. Au- gustine. Part the Second prefaces the narrative of the wreck with perhaps the most beautiful passage in the poem, a stanza on the worn theme of the inevitability of death: 'Some find me a sword; some The flange and the rail; flame, Fang, or flood' goes Death on drum, And storms bugle his fame. But we' dream we are rooted in earth-Dust! Flesh falls within sight of us, we, though our flower the same, Wave with the meadow, forget that there must The sour scythe cringe, and the blear share come. Death speaks in images that blend the tradi- tional-sword, flame, fang, flood-with the (in 1875) still modern railroad train; and it must be the quiet unmannered precision of the words as well as their absorption into the remarkably elab- orate though unostentatious alliterative and assonantal pattern that permits this surprising yet, as written, scarcely noticeable collocation. The meeting of flange and rail is the cutting edge of death to the victim in its path, and the image of the railroad train, divested of all else, here becomes one with sword and scythe. "The sour scythe cringe" too is one of those incredibly exact flashes of physical, almost visceral imagination that sometimes distinguish Hopkins' lines. Here it imparts life to the ancient rhetorical device of the transferred epithet. It is the victim, not the scythe, that cringes, but the shape of a scythe is the shape of a cringe. Reading Hopkins' words, one feels the tightening ventral curve with al- most the physical immediacy of the prodded caterpillar. The language of this whole stanza deserves but does not need an essay to itself. The story of the wreck follows in a finely con- trolled, flexible but conventional anapestic meter (or in that logaoedic iambic-anapestic which con- stitutes nearly all successful verse that goes by the name of anapest). The "sprung" effects that in the earlier stanzas mingle with this standard rhythm and that will reappear later are almost wholly absent here. The narrative is straightfor- ward, literally exact, sometimes following word for word the published testimony of survivors, till Hopkins reaches the subject of the chief nun and the call she was said to have uttered. Here the factual narrative ends and the poet begins to pre- pare for his climactic half-statement; and here it is necessary to pause for an explanation of what appears to be the only viable reading of the four- teen stanzas that follow. These seem to me clearly to embody the suggestion that a miracle had oc- curred, that during the night of terror at sea Christ had appeared to the nun, not in a subjec- tive or imagined vision but as a real miraculous presence and that this, once acknowledged and published to the world, might become the needed signal, the turning point for the conversion of English Christians. This reading requires defence. To turn, there- fore, first to the external facts with which Hop- kins was dealing-for he invented no explicit additions to them. Newspaper reports had de- tailed the events: the vessel, driven off course in the winter storm, struck a sandbar (the Kentish Knock); its propeller broke; distress signals brought no aid. As the tide rose many attempted to take refuge in the rigging; hope dwindled as the waters rose without floating the ship; women and children wailed; one heroic sailor died trying to save the more helpless. These events all be- came part of Hopkins' narrative. Five nuns, emigrating from Germany to America in conse- quence of Bismarck's repressive measures against the Catholic Church, were among the many who perished; the Times's account of the wreck con- tained two brief reports of them. One of these said that the women had "clasped hands and were drowned together, the chief sister, a gaunt</page><page sequence="8">Elisabeth W. Schneider 117 woman 6 ft. high, calling out loudly and often, 'O Christ, come quickly!' till the end came." The report of their funeral two days later contained a slightly different version: "One [nun], noted for her extreme tallness, is the lady who, at midnight on Monday, by standing on a table in the saloon, was able to thrust her body through the skylight, and kept exclaiming, in a voice heard by those in the rigging above the roar of the storm, 'My God, my God, make haste, make haste'."" Noth- ing at all beyond this was reported of their ac- tions, no strikingly heroic act, and Hopkins added nothing; yet he made of the leading nun's cry and its meaning (not, it should be noted, of their death, which many Catholics regarded as mar- tyrdom) the central event of the poem. To do so, at such length, would seem to make sense under one construction only. The chief nun appears first at the end of the seventeenth stanza-"a lioness arose . . . a prophetess towered . . . a virginal tongue told"- and the thought of her call moves his heart to speak out, moves him to tears too, but tears of joy. Before her call is actually quoted, Hopkins interposes five stanzas in which the history of the nuns is interrupted by a recurrence to the Scotist reconciliation of stars and storms through their coupled origin in time-"from life's dawn" they have been joined: St. Gertrude, "lily," and her fellow townsman Luther, "beast of the waste wood," Abel and Cain, "storm flakes" and flowers. Foreshadowing the final hoped-for re- conciliation of the specific storm of the Deutsch- land's wreck, these allusions are further inter- laced with a rhapsody on the sacred symbolism, associated with miracles, of the number five: the wounds of Christ and their miraculous appear- ance in the stigmata of St. Francis: there were five nuns and they belonged to a Franciscan or- der. At last the chief nun's call is quoted: "O Christ, Christ, come quickly" (Stanza 24). To most readers such a cry in such circumstances from anyone reared in Christian faith would seem the most natural of utterances. The poet, how- ever, exclaiming, "The majestyl what did she mean?" and asking the Holy Spirit to answer his question-"Breathe, arch and original Breath" (Stanza 25)-devotes four stanzas to an explora- tion of her possible meaning, eliminating at last all but one. Was it eagerness to sacrifice her life in imitation of Christ? Not even his disciples were of that mind, the poet says, and recalls the Biblical account of Jesus calming the waters of the Lake of Genesareth when his disciples were frightened and the other miracle so often asso- ciated with it, when through the storm He walked over the waters to His disciples and again calmed wind and wave. Or was the nun longing for heaven because of the acuteness of her present suffering? Both meanings are dismissed at length on naturalistic, rather penetrating psychological grounds. Yet the whole discussion is far-fetched, gratuitous in fact, except as it is seen leading to the supernatural meaning in the crucial stanza (Stanza 28), which implies without quite saying what the nun did mean: But how shall I . .. make me room there: Reach me a . .. Fancy, come faster- Strike you the sight of it? Look at it loom there, Thing that she . . . there then! the Master, Ipse, the only one, Christ, King, Head: He was to cure the extremity where he had cast her; Do, deal, lord it with living and dead;'2 Let him ride, her pride, in his triumph, despatch and have done with his doom there. Poetically this does not quite work, but the intention is surely evident. What he has to say, what the nun's cry really meant, is beyond the power of speech except for breathless, fragmen- tary exclamation, "look at it loom there, / ... there then! the Master, / Ipse . . . "-his very self. Hopkins did not ordinarily introduce foreign words into his poetry, but the English language has no intensive to match for emphasis and con- densation the Latin ipse, with its utter concentra- tion of selfhood. The drift of this stanza clearly is that the nun saw Christ; and it seems to me equally clear that what is implied is a supernat- ural event, not an ambiguous "vision" or a hallucination. If it were either of these, the pre- ceding stanzas would be an absurd building up to an anticlimax and much that follows would be pointless and very nearly meaningless. For the nun is now identified with Simon Peter (to whom Jesus was said to have appeared mirac- ulously walking over the waters) and then, fulfilling an earlier foreshadowing (the "virginal tongue told" of Stanza 17), becomes an analogue of the Virgin Mary, to whom also, as the poem goes on to say, the Word came-through the Annunciation-and from whom the Word issued (Mary "uttered thee ["Jesu"] ou'tright" [Stanza 30]). The connection between the two stanzas embodying these parallels is cemented formally by a repetition of the three words of the major 11 The Times, 11 and 13 Dec. 1875 (reprinted, with minor differences, in Immorta Diamond, pp. 368,374). 12 In thouight and language this line echoes "Lord of living and dead" in the first stanza.</page><page sequence="9">118 "The Wreck of the Deutschland" rhyme, in inverted order, the rhymes right, night, light of Stanza 29 becoming light, night, outright in No. 30. There is a preliminary hint of the miraculous event earlier: the nun is said to have "one fetch in her," an odd expression, by some critics inter- preted to mean that she has one resource avail- able, her faith. I think it means more than this. In Ireland, Scotland, and much of the north and west of Englandfetch is a name for an apparition, wraith, ghost, or spirit, sometimes of the living, sometimes of the dead. Scott uses it-"His. . . fetch or wraith or double-ganger"-and so does Yeats."3 More important, so does Hopkins him- self, and with reference to a miracle which he was taking pains to distinguish from a subjective vision -a context, that is, identical with that of the poem: "At any rate I suppose the vision of the pregnant woman to have been no mere vision but the real fetching, presentment, or 'adduction' of the persons, Christ and Mary, themselves" (adduc- tion, according to Father Devlin, is "the technical term used by Scotus . . . where he proves that it is strictly possible for the same body to be in more than one place at the same time"-Devotional Writ- ings, pp. 200, 308 [my italics]). An individual Catholic may not claim or pub- lish a miracle, but there was nothing to prevent Hopkins' suggesting it as he did, clearly though not quite explicitly, in a poem which he would publish, if at all, only with the approval and un- der the auspices of his order. When the Wreck was rejected by The Month, whose editor, Fr. Henry Coleridge, was his oldest friend in the order, Hopkins gave up the thought of publica- tion (Letters, iii, 138). Probably his quite excep- tional statement to Bridges-"granted that it needs study and is obscure, for indeed I was not over-desirous that the meaning of all should be quite clear, at least unmistakable" (Letters, i, 50 [my italics])-had reference to this particular mean- ing, for always on other occasions Hopkins was more than eager to have his literal meaning un- derstood. It seems likely that many readers have been aware of these implications in the central stanza; one or two critics have referred somewhat neu- trally to the nun's "vision." Most have avoided the subject, perhaps because the meaning is dis- tasteful or because it opens Hopkins to the charge of credulity (though credulity in such matters is inescapable in his letters and journals) or because it was desired to save the poem from controversy or skeptical contempt. To ignore the literal mean- ing of the central stanza would be my own pref- erence, if it were not for the fact that this is the pivot upon which the main thought of the poem turns. Without it the structure of the whole falls apart: lines and stanzas of an otherwise inexpli- cably feverish intensity float loose from either rational or poetic moorings. Much of what is said about the nun before and after this stanza can be justified, as to what is said and at what length, only if a miracle is pointed to. The over-all pro- portions of the poem require it, for we have to reckon with the fact, already referred to, that though the nuns undoubtedly died bravely no special heroic actions were attributed to them either in the newspapers or by Hopkins and that all the fourteen stanzas (out of a total of thirty- five in the poem) hinge upon the cry, not the martyrdom, of the chief nun. This cry may "startle the poor sheep back," the poet says. But more than the Deutschland's sufferers are meant as this statement is broadened into the question, "Is the shipwrack then a harvest, does tempest carry the grain for thee?" where the themes of conversion and reconciliation of suffer- ing are explicitly brought together. The climactic ipse stanza brings a return to sprung rhythm, which has been largely in abey- ance after the opening lines of Part ii, but which from this point on is dominant, becoming more and more irregular, the meter now for the first time stretched to the limits as Hopkins later de- fined them, though the stanza form and the fixed number of beats in the lines are rigidly preserved. The effect is of an increasingly broad, orchestral movement as the theme itself broadens toward its conclusion. The four closing stanzas begin with a recapitu- lation of the opening acknowledgement to God the wielder of all Power, framed in sea and shore imagery now of greater magnitude than at first and in language that harks back to the appalling declaration of omnipotence in the Book of Job, when the Lord speaks out of the whirlwind. But the bare acknowledgement of Power now becomes affirmation as well: "I admire thee," the poet says-admire carrying both its ancient or Mil- tonic and its modern sense. This celebration of Power is balanced by a succeeding stanza on divine mercy and compassion, and the two are again bound together within a common rhyme and into a single sentence as well: I admire thee, master of the tides, Of the Yore-flood, of the year's fall; 13 OED, also English Dialect Dictionary; Yeats, introduc- tion to Irish Fairy and Folk Tales.</page><page sequence="10">Elisabeth W. Schneider 119 The recurb and the recovery of the gulf's sides, The girth of it and the wharf of it and the wall; Stanching, quenching ocean of a motionable mind; Ground of being, and granite of it: past all Grasp God, throned behind Death with a sovereignty that heeds but hides, bodes but abides; With a mercy that outrides The all of water, an ark For the listener; for the lingerer with a love glides Lower than death and the dark; A vein for the visiting of the past-prayer, pent in prison, The-last-breath penitent spirits-the uttermost mark Our passion-plunged giant risen, The Christ of the Father compassionate, fetched in the storm of his strides. (Stanzas 32-33) The recapitulatory character of this passage is underscored by the reappearance of a great many key words, several of them used earlier in strange or striking ways, and by recapitulatory images as well: "Thou mastering me / God! . . . sway of the sea," from the opening stanza, is now "I ad- mire thee, master of the tides"; "world's strand" is now intensified into "the recurb . . . of the gulf's sides ... ground of being and granite of it"; "fall," "wall," and "past all" repeat rhyme words of the hourglass stanza (wall, fall, tall); "the uttermost mark," an unusual phrase, echoes the earlier, mannered line, "Mark [verb], the mark is of man's make" (Stanza 22); and "fetched in the storm of his strides" repeats both the allusion to Christ's walking on the waters and the strange "fetch" of Stanza 19, which had pref- aced the appearance of the "Master." The cryptic statement of the second of these stanzas has been variously read but seems to me to be this, continuing from the preceding, ad- dressed to God: "past all grasp God, throned behind death with a sovereignty... ; with a mercy ... an ark for the listener [i.e., for him who already listens to God]; [and] for the lin- gerer [the laggard in faith] with a love [that] glides lower than death and the dark; a vein [parallel with ark] for the visiting," etc. The sentence breaks in the sixth line with the dash; and uttermost is a summarizing and emphatic substantive, the very uttermost, of whom he has been speaking. The word is used both in its sense of extremes (i.e., those in extremity) and in the archaic sense so powerful in Milton, whose utter is outer as well as extreme darkness, or as in the still current phrase, the "uttermost parts of the earth"; those in extremity, those at the outer- most fringes, farthest from God, "mark [a verb] our . . . giant risen, Christ, fetched [a participle -brought to the scene, materialized like the "fetching" of Christ and Mary described in his prose devotional writing] in the storm of his strides." The passage is thus part of the recapit- ulation, recalling an earlier passage toward the end of Part I: "Hither then, last or first, / To hero of Calvary, Christ's, feet- / Never ask if meaning it, wanting it, warned of it-men go" (Stanza 8).14 Finally, in the last two stanzas the poet calls upon Christ as he had called upon God at the end of Part i, praying that He may return upon England not with the destruction of doomsday and not humbly unknown as at his birth but, "royally reclaiming his own" strayed sheep, may return as "a released shower, let flash" to the shires of England, not as a "lightning of fire hard- hurled." And the nun is asked to intercede in heaven to this end, that "our King" may return to "English souls," that the sun may rise again upon "rare-dear Britain."'5 The prayer ends with a series of epithets of Christ, evidently meant to bring the whole to a prophetically triumphant, all-inclusive close like the great resolution of a large-scale organ fugue: Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest, Our hearts' charity's hearth's fire, our thoughts' chivalry's throng's Lord. Poetically, these last two lines seem to me to fail; they are simply too mannered to produce the tremendous, all-stops-opened effect at which they 14 I have given the reading in some detail because the pas- sage is an important link in the thought and has been read quite differently by Gardner in his notes to the poem. He takes mark to be a noun, fetched a verb, so as to read (as I understand him) "The uttermost mark [that] our giant fetched." This seems to me to have little or no meaning in its context; the sense of "mark" is vague andfetched more than a little slangy as well as wrenched into a wrong tense: present, perfect, or future would be conceivable but not the simple past. There is a verbal parallel to the reading I have sug- gested in the sentence opening the sestet of The Soldier (Poems, p. 105), written a few months later, "Mark Christ our King," as well as the thematic parallel in the "last or first ... men go" of Stanza 8. 15 The fact that it is especially English conversion that Hopkins prays for at the close is signified not only by the specific naming of English souls and Britain but also by the indicated metrical stresses. Gardner (i, 284) prints from MS authority the foUlowing: Dame, at our door / Drowned, and among our shoals, in which the second oulr, if not the first also, wrenches the natural reading of the line badly, for the sake, evidently, of this special emphasis.</page><page sequence="11">120 "The Wreck of the Deutschland" evidently aim. The final line is symmetrically constructed and locked together in the grammat- ical grip of the possessive case that seems meant to create the closest unity of all human values in Christ, but the effect, upon this reader at least, is of eccentricity rather than power; what should be a satisfying resolution I find myself preferring to forget. It is one of those passages in which Hopkins' art is betrayed by his schematic in- genuity. In a sense, the possessive case may be regarded as the closest of grammatical relation- ships, most nearly making one thing out of two by force of grammatical law. This, at any rate, seems to me the rationale of the line, but the re- sult is more ingenious than beautiful or moving. Metrically, too, the line is arbitrary. Its stresses can be made out with confidence only through manuscript authority, which places a stress on the monosyllables: "hearts . .. hea'rth's fire; thoughts'. . . throng's Lord," leaving the tri- sllabic charity's and chivalry's without stress. Alliteration, assonance, and stress (and even singulars and plurals) are thus distributed sym- metrically with reference to the monosyllabic and the trisyllabic words. The symmetry in- creases the more one looks at it, but the effect is labored and one has no sense of the inevitable in the succession of epithets. No poem of Hopkins shows a more carefully wrought structure than the Wreck. The "design, pattern or what I am in the habit of calling 'in- scape' " meant to him finding, for an experience that was to become a poem, its individual form, with the particular kind of formal balance it re- quired, the organic symmetry of a living form (though, as we have just seen, over-ingenious logic now and then betrayed him into a mechani- cal symmetry instead). In these terms the parts and their proportions in the Wreck of the Deutsch- land are conceived, and the clarity of the design is a remarkable achievement in view of the re- calcitrant material. As was indicated to begin with, the primary outline is simple but the detail of the design complex. There is, for example, the framing of the poem by the measured, sonorous apostrophes at the opening and the close: the prayer of submission to the God of Power in the first stanza reappearing magnified, altered, and enlarged so as to draw all the strands into the recapitulation. Part I, as the individual rehearsal of the more universal theme, has its own smaller but matching conclusion, Part ii its not quite matching opening, in which the note struck is again a universal but a different universal (the human one of death), defeating a too exact sym- metry. The inclination of Hopkins towards two-part forms led him to some extravagant pseudo-ra- tional theorizing about the sonnet, of which the two-part Italian form was for him the only one that counted. On the proportions of the parts he was for a while quite doctrinaire, having got it all down into a mathematical formula of which he found close counterparts in St. Augustine's discussion of the placing of certain caesuras in De Musica and in the relation between penta- chord and tetrachord in the major and minor diatonic scales and the earlier modes of plain song in music. Equal proportions alone are too symmetrical and too simple, and so also, he said, is a mere 2:1 proportion.16 As he did not specifi- cally discuss the proportions of the Deutschland in this way, one is not obliged to suppose that a special virtue inhered in its mathematical pro- portions of 2:5 (10:25 stanzas), though he would be capable of arguing even this. The form is dis- tantly comparable in his terms-or he may have thought of it so-to the plagal mode in music, in which he noted the reversal of the more com- mon order by the tetrachord's being placed first, a form not unlike that of an upside-down sonnet. It is tempting to see in Hopkins' preoccupation with two-part poetic structure, at any rate, in preference to the more common and more easily unified single progression and three-part forms, a symbolic reflection of the unresolved dualism in his own temperament. To pursue this point, how- ever, would be a digression that had better be foregone here. A further element enters to complicate the pri- mary design of the Deutschland. The narrative and descriptive account of the wreck differs in conspicuous ways from the rest of the poem. Its objective, physical literalness causes it to stand out prominently, like the foreground in a land- scape, in contrast to the subjective and spiritual matter that occupies the rest of the poem; the narrative stanzas, moreover, move more swiftly in thought, and their verse, almost all smoothly anapestic, moves with corresponding speed. As these objective stanzas occupy the middle place in the poem, they tend to create an effect, struc- turally, of a three-part form superimposed upon the primary two-part one. So strongly marked is this secondary division that some critics have 18 Letters, it, 71-72, and cf. 85-86. The poem Pied Beauty he described as a curtal sonnet; that is, a poem shorter than a standard sonnet but preserving the same interior proportions.</page><page sequence="12">Elisabeth W. Schneider 121 noticed it alone and, interpreting the poem, have ignored the more fundamental, explicitly num- bered two-part form and its correspondent meaning altogether. Other complexities arise out of the knotty texture of the thought in certain passages; and, of course, throughout the whole runs the intricate texture of the language, the several related themes, the recurrent imagery, and the changing music and meter, of which the reader becomes more and more aware as his fam- iliarity with the poem increases. The final effect, obviously, is of a complex, not a simple poetic organization, and also of a tightly knit one. There are two criteria-or it may be they are fetishes-that have particularly marked today's criticism and poetry, and it is interesting to see where Hopkins' poem stands with reference to them. Modern readers have become accustomed to the employment of imagery for structural purposes, and modern criticism has made us so aware of this element in poetry of the past as well as the present that we have come to see it almost everywhere. Actually, however, its use by older writers was sporadic, usually unsystematic, and when present often quite slight. In particu- lar, it is not a notable feature of the Romantic and early Victorian poetry from which that of Hopkins emerged. Its prominence in his work is one of the least noticed aspects of his modern ap- peal, along with this link to the seventeenth cen- tury. No doubt Herbert, whose work he knew and loved, influenced him, though his use of imagery for formal design must be mainly owing to his care for "inscape" in painting and nature and to the precepts of Modern Painters. The other modern principle in the light of which it is interesting to consider the Wreck is that now commonly referred to as the need for a "persona." By this criterion the poem, like nearly all the mature work of Hopkins, will be found most unmodern and most "Romantic." When he told Bridges, justifying the poem in the face of his friend's dislike, "I may add for your greater interest and edification that what refers to myself in the poem is all strictly and literally true and did all occur; nothing is added for poet- ical padding" (Letters, i, 47), the contemptuous word padding makes evident that he recognized no aesthetic or theoretical need for a separation between himself, Gerard Hopkins, and the speaker of the poem. Where is the irony, where is the mask, where is even the thin screen of the impersonal that can lend aesthetic distance to make this a poem and not simply an unmodu- lated, moving perhaps but embarrassing, per- sonal cry of longing and faith? As Eliot long ago pointed out, in somewhat different terms, this is a major weakness in all but the greatest Roman- tic poetry: as a poet you automatically take a stand slightly elsewhere than where you are, but often, if you are a Romantic poet, you fail to stay there. This results in the uncertainty, the unreliability of tone that so often breaks the charm of that poetry.'7 I am not sure that I can put my finger precisely on the means by which Hopkins transcends the difficulty; and in fact, as I have indicated in other terms earlier, in cer- tain passages he obviously fails to do so. But at his best he does transcend it, and his success must be due mainly to his remarkable mastery over a distinguished form-after all, form is a kind of persona or serves the same purpose-and to the elevation of style, which lifts the speaker above the level of the human Gerard Hopkins to that of a universalized poet-prophet speaking as if out of a vision even when he speaks in personal terms. Considering the Wreck of the Deutschland purely as a poem, then, what do we have? Some passages, as I have said, seem to me to fail through loss of the established tone or through eccentricity of taste or feeling, sometimes deriv- ing from the frigidity of scholastic logic insuffi- ciently transformed. One finds oneself put off here and there also by words, phrases, and im- ages that seem out of key. After his undergrad- uate days were over, the aesthetic side of Hopkins' life had to develop almost entirely in isolation; and as even from youth his tempera- ment bordered on the eccentric, it was probably inevitable that his thought, feeling, and expres- sion should have become sometimes queer. He knew this. Freer contact with the cultivated lay world might have toned it down, or might not. More pervasive in the Wreck is another difficulty, the fact that not all of the emotional intensities of the poem are felt to be adequately accounted for within the poem. If the theme is fully under- stood,",however-if the implication of a miracle 17 Cf., however, George T. Wright's interesting discussion of the persona in Romantic poetry (The Poet in the Poem, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1960, pp. 92 if.). Wright argues that even the Romantic poet's "I" is not his real self and in- stances particularly such writers as Byron, Whitman, Wilde (but what of Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley?). It is prob- ably quite sound to say that wherever there is aesthetic dis- tancing there is in some sense a "persona"-though this may be extending the sense of a cult word beyond the point of use- fulness.</page><page sequence="13">122 "The Wreck of the Deutschland" with profound consequences to come is recog- nized as the central event-and if the reader is capable of suspending his disbelief for the mo- ment (possibly a large if) the discrepancy between heightened emotion and its represented cause disappears except in isolated lines such as that describing the "glee" in his heart as he weeps (Stanza 18), where the requisite dignity of tone is wrecked by, I think, unacceptably ab- normal emotion. The Deutschland is a poem, then, of unequal but indisputable greatness, to be ranked among the great odes of the English language. Structur- ally it impresses the reader with the sense of magnitude and order; and as to the detail, in passage after passage a thought, emotion, or sensation seems inevitably married to its lan- guage and to the sound of that language. A bliz- zard at sea is epitomized for all time in the two lines, bound together by their w and long and short i sounds and moving with the abrupt fall from quintessential concrete sensation in one line to the depths of abstraction in the next: Wiry and white-fiery and whirlwind-swivelled snow Spins to the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps. Even the worn abstraction of the sea in deeps regains a century's-lost impressiveness following as it does after the concrete distinctive epithets of the snow and the other abysmal negative ab- stractions. Nor do I know any passage in English poetry in which alliteration, assonance, and other kinds of sound pattern are more expressive, and more fully under disciplined control than in the great stanza on death. Perhaps the poem will continue to be valued most frequently as a mine of fine poetical phrases and images, but it is far more than this; and the phrases themselves are finer when they are known as part of an intelli- gible whole. Finally, there is the remarkable rhythmic beauty and sweep of the poem and of many individual stanzas, with the changing movement so subtly responsive to the shifting mood. It is a new music that we hear, and stanza after stanza haunts the memory because of it- a new, flexible, and expressive rhythm the beauty of which is due, incidentally, at least as much to Hopkins' subtle and sensitive handling of the dangerously facile English anapest as to his newly invented sprung rhythm but also-and most of all-to the refinement with which the two rhythms are combined and the structural relation which they bear to the meaning and de- sign of the whole.
