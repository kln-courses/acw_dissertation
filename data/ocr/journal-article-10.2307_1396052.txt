<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Jon D. Levenson, Creation and the Persistence of Evil: The Jewish Drama of Divine Omnipotence (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1988). xvii + 182 pages. Just what does one do with biblical passages like: "It was You who hacked Rahab to pieces, that pierced the Dragon. It was You that dried up the Sea, the Waters of the Great Deep" (Isaiah 51:9-10)? and "It was You who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters, who crushed the heads of Leviathan, who left him as food for the denizens of the desert" (Psalm 74:13-14)? and "God takes His stand in the assembly of El; among the gods He pronounces judgment . . . I had said, 'You are gods, sons of Elyon, all of you; but you shall die like a man, fall like a prince" (Psalm 82:1,6-7)? and "Can you draw out Leviathan by a fishhook? Can you press down his tongue by a rope? Can you put a ring through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a barb? .. Will you play with him like a bird, and tie him down for your girls" (Job 40:25-29)? and "In that day the Lord will punish with His great, cruel, mighty sword Leviathan, the elusive Ser- pent; Leviathan, the twisting Serpent; He will slay the Dragon in the sea" (Isaiah 27:1)? Good rabbinic Jews, basking in the reflected light of Maimonides and the Enlightenment, run for the door in the presence of such passages. We grab for the straw of metaphor. We grasp in panic at the plank of demythologization. We rush to the theology of creatio ex nihilo and de- anthropomorphism to push such passages back into their proper place. But it is not so, and was not so, as Jon Levenson demonstrates with a slow massing of evidence in this book. In the beginning, God did not create the waters, nor the chaos, nor the depths, nor the primal darkness. And if Psalm 74, Psalm 104, Isaiah 51, Job 38 and Job 40 are to be taken seriously (in contrast to Genesis 1), He did not create the various pri- mordial monsters either. This does not mean that God did not become God. Rather, it means that God became God-He "created" -by imposing order on the, sometimes hostile, chaos of the universe. "Creation" was not a creating-out-of-nothing but a "setting of boundaries" (Psalm 74:17; Psalm 104:9); a saying, "You may come so far and no farther; here your surging waves will stop" (Job 38:11). Furthermore, "creation" was not a one-time act somewhere in eternity, for the forces of chaos still threaten to well up out of the depths as the promise to Noah (Genesis 9), repeated in Isaiah (54:9), shows. Nature is not autonomous after creation but must be continually subjected to God's will to contain it. 105</page><page sequence="2">Modern Judaism Levenson presents these ideas in chapters one and two. He then notes that many of the chaos-battle passages come in the context of catastrophe and he suggests, in chapters two and three, that God's triumph in the beginning is the basis for a "lament" which challenges God to act again, as He had done then, and redeem His people. Defeat and humilia- tion call forth the God of the primordial battle and "dare" Him (49) to be victorious again. The repetition of this cry, however, became "endless and structural" (32; I think "more and more useless" would be better) as the cognitive dissonance between God's primordial victories and His abysmal failure to protect His people in real history became harder to bear. So the people "eschatologized" the wish (Isaiah 24-27). Rabbinic Judaism expanded this motif by adding the Leviathan-feast; by adding the evil impulse, Amalek, and others as mythic figures; and by postulating that God Himself is not one until the eschatological victory over the forces of chaos and evil (33-46). In part two, Levenson tries to set these various biblical passages into some order, deciding that there is a process of "demythologization and depersonalization" already at work in the biblical texts (moving from Job 40 to Psalm 104 to Genesis 1). He also points to the heptadic structure of Genesis 1 (chapter six), to the microcosm-macrocosm motif in the homology of the temple to creation (chapter seven), and to the biblical understanding of "rest" which includes humanity contrary to most ancient Near Eastern mythology (chapter eight). He notes that the "image of God" in which humanity is created is not some essence or immaterial aspect of our being but resides in our ability to rule over creation (112- 117). Finally, Levenson notes that the Sabbath is a "mimetic reenactment" of God's creative acts in that we too set boundaries and make distinctions (118-120). Chapter nine is an excellent summary of parts one and two and it concludes by suggesting that, contrary to late exilic theology, biblical theology understands evil to be continually present but containable. It can be restrained within boundaries; it can be set apart by "dividing," by "making distinctions." God, thus, functions as a priest-dividing, dis- tinguishing. Hence, Genesis 1 is sabbatical and priestly in its tone and theology (127). If part one is brilliant, part two seems to me to fail. The ordering of the sources to create a demythologizing trend must assume the trend in order to prove it. Why could not several trends have existed side by side? Also, the theorizing about the heptadic structure and the new year is very speculative. Furthermore, one could argue that the cumulative trauma of empirical historical reality would lead to greater and greater repression and hence to an increasingly intense fantasy-which would account for the deeper eschatologizing trend in rabbinic civilization. (Could the denial of this denial be a de-eschatologizing trend in Zionism?) More importantly: (1) Setting structures and making distinctions is 106</page><page sequence="3">not only a priestly activity. Anyone with an orderly mind does these things. Furthermore, theology precedes sociology, i.e., the existence of an ordered creation account and a structured sanctuary with a precisely ordained cult defines priestliness, not vice versa. (2) By the same reason- ing, creatio sine oppositio, while certainly a correct category, need not be the product of a priestly mind. It might well have developed in the mind of a dynastic court theologian. Finally, (3) there are many types of assent, many gradations of belief. Contemporary Jews commonly "knock on wood" (of the Cross), or use "Jesus Christ" as an exclamation, or slip in the Yiddish phrase which is meant to ward off the evil eye, or read their horoscopes. Yet they do not really "believe" in these things. This leads to the question, what did the use of these repressed myths mean for the various biblical authors? How serious was this problem, and for whom? Put another way, were the demythologized motifs still mythic enough to compel assent? Maimonides would say no; Freud, yes; but what did the Psalmist mean? Part three deals with the dynamics of lordship and submission. Chapters ten and eleven present the suzerainty treaty and the combat myth as two idioms for the same ideal: the exclusive enthronement of God and the uncompromising loyalty of the people (135). Levenson astutely points out that, in both idioms, there is an arrangement between unequal parties, that the vanquished really has no choice, that the awesome power of the superior is harnassed, and that the superior must always court the vassal in order to retain control (144). This is a "theology of fragile lordship" (139). Also, suzerainty treaties use phrases familiar to readers of the Bible such as, "You shall love Assurbanipal as yourselves" (137). Levenson artfully weaves in these same strands from later rabbinic sources. Chapter twelve juxtaposes Genesis 18 (Abraham's argument over Sodom) with Genesis 22 (the binding of Isaac) to establish a dialectic of autonomy-heteronomy as one mode of sovereign-vassal relationship. Levenson then cites the close of the Book of Job as the other mode of God-human relationship: an open and unconditional submission to the sovereign brings about a reprieve from the "inhumanity" and "frigidity" of theocentrism; "it is through submission to exactly those [magisterial] claims that the good order that is creation comes into being" (156). Sub- mission is restorative, spiritually liberating. Levenson could have strengthened his claim that submission gen- erates renewed wholeness from the rabbinic sources by reference to re- pentance and confession as practiced in rabbinic Judaism. He might also have cited the recurring theme of the assertion of God's kingship and acceptance of His kingdom which is central to the New Year liturgy. This book is well-written. Each unit summarizes the previous material and concludes with a summary of the current work. The use of biblical texts and contexts is subtle and nuanced. The in-house argument with Reviews 107</page><page sequence="4">Modern Judaism other biblical scholars is present but not intrusive. The use of rabbinic materials as a theological supplement is wise and tastefully done. The notes and the indices to the book are full and useful. As an essay in biblical theology, it seems to me correct (though others will have their say on this). As a background essay in contemporary theology, the book is fascinating. Levenson's proposal of a "theology of fragile lordship," in which God is acknowledged as sovereign but must work to continually contain the forces of chaos and evil, is sound theology. But, as one who has taught this for many years with all the biblical and rabbinic sources at my dis- posal, I can say that this is an idea that meets with deep psychological and spiritual resistance. People, and even we in certain moments, do not want to know that God is not omnipotent, absolutely sovereign, completely in command. Interestingly, Levenson himself gives the clue to that resistance by noting that the appeal to the God of the combat myth occurs in contexts of disaster, for it is precisely humiliation that, as Freud would lead us to suppose, moves us to project/expect more of our sovereign God. It is the cognitive dissonance between reality and faith that gen- erates omnipotence. Rabbinic Judaism recognizes this, for the twice daily recitation of the Shema and the midrash on God's witnesses (139), together with the introduction of the evil impulse and the concept of sins of thought, represent exactly this motif: the denial of the dissonance, the increasingly aggressive reaffirmation of God's sovereignty in a world which belies it. Classical Judaism is not, thus, "the mature Rabbinic thought of the Talmud" (139). Let me be clear. Historically, the formal doctrine of omnipotence did not result from national trauma but the appeal and tenacity of that doctrine, even today, especially in the face of the Holocaust, is witness to the suppression of an increasingly agonizing cognitive dissonance. In simpler language, as we are more abused, we have a greater need of an absolutely powerful figure to right our wrongs. The "theology of fragile lordship," then, is correct but it will not be popular. The "theology of fragile lordship," like the covenantal theology of David Hartman, is realistic; it is rooted in the analogy of marriage or better, in the analogy of parent-child relationships, which are truly fragile balances of authority and submission, of love and independence. But it is hard to live with ambiguity, partial power, and incomplete control-especially in times of stress. Similarly, the dynamic of restorative submission is effective precisely because it affirms the omni-dimension of God. It is, theologically and psychologically, a true response but it stands over against the motif of co- responsibility inherent in the concept of covenant, especially of the non- suzerainty type. Submission ("islam") finds its life in the world of ab- solutes. 108</page><page sequence="5">Reviews This brings up another problem with these theological propositions: Is the suzerainty treaty, or combat myth, or the dynamic of restorative submission an adequate theological model for the beginning of the twenty-first century? Do we, heirs to biblical and rabbinic theology, really want to live the paradigm of the patriarchal King-servant? Can we really reverse the autonomy which we humans have arrogated to our- selves since the Enlightenment? Will our brothers and sisters in the faith agree to such a move? I think that the first half of chapter twelve fights with the second half on this subject for, in addition to the model of Job's absolute submission, Levenson seems to be suggesting that the submission of the Akeda requires, or theologically implies, the argumentativeness of Sodom. He is, of course, correct in this: the theology of fragile lordship implies, not only the theology of submission, but also the theology of protest. And, as there is ample testimony in biblical and rabbinic tra- dition to submission, so there is ample testimony to protest. Our willing- ness to live the absolute King-servant paradigm, then, would seem to have to be tempered. Soloveitchik has made the same point in his de- scription of the autonomy-heteronomy of halakhic and covenantal man. On the matter of resolving this tension between "fragile" and "lord- ship," between "submission" and "protest" or "co-responsibility," Leven- son has missed a key point. In his attempt to "do" a theology of the Bible which will have echoes for the contemporary world, Levenson has gotten caught up in the professional theologian's assumption that his or her system must be consistent. Jewish theologians since Saadia have been trying to make Jewish theology coherent, rational, ordered, whole in the sense of one worked piece of intellectual art. But, pace the philosophical theologians, Jewish theology was not like that before the early Middle Ages. Biblical theology, as Levenson's sources show clearly, was not of one mind even on the nature of the creation myth. Rabbinic theology, as Max Kadushin and indeed a reading of rabbinic texts indicates, is also not of one mind. Jews differ about God and so Jewish theology varies. More important: we ourselves change as we traverse life's paths. Our own theology is no more coherent than our attitude towards our children or our spouses. Rather, life moves seriatim, in fits and starts. Life is like sailing into the wind; it cannot be done directly, only by tacking first in one direction and then in another. We start with enthusiasm and then we waver and then we reaffirm-in all things: in marriage, in parenting, in career, in faith, and in theology. There is, thus, a time for everything. There is a time for unyielding protest (on the subject of the Holocaust) and there is a time for submission (on the subject of our own recalcitrance). There is a time for an absolutely omnipotent God (in humiliation and disaster) and there is a time for a fragile Lord (in building a community or a family). There is a time to repress the dissonance (in moments of danger) and a 109</page><page sequence="6">Modern Judaism time to surface it (in prayer, poetry, and study). There is a time to de- mythologize (when history beckons) and a time to live the myth fully (in seeking the depth of one's soul within one's people, one's Torah, and one's God). And the polar structure of my rhetoric itself does not begin to grasp the complexity of the real-life movement. Reality undermines the trope. "Fragile" and "lordship," then, must alternate in our religious ex- perience. "Submission" and "protest" must take turns in our speech before God. There can be no one attitude toward the divine. Levenson grasps this when he points out that the biblical authors affirm both the under- mining evidence of the senses and the uninterrupted mastery of God (19, 32) but Levenson does not make this insight a key to understanding the lived religious life. If life is a movement among modes of understanding and being what, then, is "true"? It may be that the question is wrong (although that will not make the philosophical theologians happy). It may also be that there is only our individual concrete lives lived in the presence of that other life which is God, and all the rest is commentary (though that will alienate the ritualists and legalists). It may also be that the divine concern, that generated and sustains the whole interactive process of creation and governance, concentrates on some things more than others while ne- glecting none of them (although this will offend the absolutists). It may also be that God, who is in the end incomparable, does not wish to be restricted even to the category of the "true" (which will offend everyone but Maimonides). As we approach the end of the twentieth century, the cognitive dis- sonance of religious life and theology in the aftermath of the Holocaust becomes greater every year. Similarly, the dissonance between religious, political, and sexual pluralism and militancy grows every year. This book, reflecting as it does the depth of biblical understanding, opens the doors of theological reflection for these times. DAVID R. BLUMENTHAL Emory University 110</page></plain_text>
