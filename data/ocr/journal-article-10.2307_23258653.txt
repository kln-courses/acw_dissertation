<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Maimonides: Tor ah and Philosophic Quest by David Hartman (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1976). Reviewed by Michael Wyschogrod Among talmudically oriented Jews, the standing of Maimonides is beyond reproach. He is the mas ter of Jewish law whose monu mental code represents a complete systematization of the less than systematic corpus of talmudic writ ing. Nevertheless, it has generally been recognized that the talmudic legal aspect of Maimonides is but a part of the whole. The other part is the Maimonides of the Guide for the Perplexed which reflects the philosophical side of Maimonides. In traditional Jewish circles this side of the man is largely ignored. I have never yet heard of a yeshiva which makes any effort to teach the Guide. It is of course true that Mai monides' great talmudic work, the Mishne Torah, also contains a philosophical introduction. Never theless, it is not difficult to ignore this section and to go to the legal portion which constitutes the bulk of the work. Those writers, on the other hand, whose primary in terest has been Maimonides the philosopher have, in the spirit of symmetry, largely ignored Mai monides as a talmudic lawyer. Now it is, of course, possible that one person can have two interests which need not be organically re lated to each other. And if this is the case here it would be a serious waste of effort to attempt to relate realms of discourse which were not meant to be related to each other. But that is not the case with Maimonides. David Hartman, author of Mai monides: Torah and Philosophic Quest, correctly believes that Mai monides did not intend his hala khic and philosophic works to be kept apart but thought of them as constituting two portions of an in tegrated whole which would be defective with either of the parts left out of account. He has no difficulty in establishing this, using a large number of cogent passages from the writings of the master. Without reviewing all the evidence adduced by Hartman, we need only mention a fact already alluded to: that the Mishne Torah opens with a large philosophical introduction which is an integral part of the work with full legal standing. Clearly, we are not dealing with a writer with two unrelated interests. But if all this is as obvious as it is, why is it necessary to devote a book to proving what cannot or, at least, should not be denied? The answer is that, however much Mai monides thought that the two parts, Torah and philosophy, added up to an organic whole, there are those who have not agreed with him. Isaac Husik, Leo Strauss and Harry Wolfson, among others, have concluded that in spite of Maimo nides' best efforts to unite his philosophic views with his com mitment to rabbinic Judaism, the synthesis is not a viable one. 105</page><page sequence="2">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought performing his religious services, dropped Copernican astronomy, and while in the observatory, dropped his church doctrines. Mai monides really saw no incompati bility between his Judaism and his philosophy: he was a Jew in letter and a philosopher in spirit through out his life." (Hartman, pp. 21 22.) Leo Strauss has constructed an elaborate detective story around this conclusion which speaks of a secret doctrine on the part of Mai monides which assigns philosophic truth to the initiated elite while retaining the Judaism of the law for the masses who are not able to rise to the level of pure contem plation. Strauss thus believes that Maimonides was fully cognizant of the incompatibility of Torah and philosophy even if he did not find it prudent to preach this from the housetops. Most other critics find Maimonides less lucid about his predicament. Wolfson asserts that "Maimonides was not a rabbi em ploying Greek logic and categories of thought in order to interpret Jewish religion: he was rather a true medieval Aristotelian using Jewish religion as an illustration of the Stagirite's metaphysical supremacy. Maimonides adheres staunchly to the Law, of course, but his adherence is not the logical consequence of his system. It has its basis in his heredity and prac tical intersts: it is not the logical implication of his philosophy. Ju daism designated the established social order of life, in which Mai monides lived and moved and had his being: and it was logically as remote from his intellectual inter ests as he was historically remote from Aristotle. That, naturally, he was unaware of the dualism must be clear. Indeed he thought he had made a synthesis and had given scientific demonstrations of poetic conceptions. Therein he was like the Italian priest and astronomer, Pietro Angelo Secchi, who, while What is the dualism which, ac cording to Wolfson, Maimonides was unaware of and which, ac cording to Strauss, he was aware of but kept secret from most of his readers? The answer is simple. Medieval Arístotelianism believed that man's highest good was the contemplation of the highest levels of rational being. The highest ex cellence of man was therefore not the active but the contemplative life because it was the most self contained life not needing the use of anything outside of itself. Be cause medieval Arístotelianism con tained a large admixture of Pla tonism and neo-Platonism and because of the Platonic elements in Aristotle himself, there was a deep conviction concerning the in feriority of the material which was impervious to reason and which man could shed as his metaphysi cal faculties were developed. The temporal order was also restricted to a very low level of reality be cause change, as the metaphysical underpinning of time, was antithe tical to reason and therefore to true being. For medieval Arísto telianism, the ethical as regulating conduct could not have ultimate metaphysical significance which only the purely contemplative could 106</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews have. Similarly, the historical could have only secondary significance because of the temporality and specificity of the historical while metaphysics dealt with the uni versal and unchanging. In this connection it may be interesting to remember Aristotle's remark (Po etics 1451b) that poetry (he meant tragedy) was more philosophic be cause it described what might hap pen while history was restricted to what did happen. The contingent historical does not have the ra tionality of the universally possi ble. The most universal of all concepts is being and it is this that is the object of metaphysics. It is not difficult to see even from this brief and incomplete summary of medieval Aristotelian ism that its spirit is not easily made compatible with Judaism. Judaism emphasizes the mitsvah, the act of fulfilling the Divine command. In most instances, the Bible does not give a rational ex planation of the reason for God commanding what he did. The im plication seems to be that it is not necessary for man to know more than that God did command it and then to do it and not to contem plate it. Judaism is historical: its foundations are historical events such as the Exodus whose signifi cance is not that they could have happened but rather that they did happen. Corporeality is not some thing that Judaism escapes from but it is something that it hallows. The election of Israel is a corporeal election of the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The doctrine of creation clashes head-on with a metaphysics of be ing which necessarily, as in Par menides, speaks of the eternity of being rather than its coming into being. For these reasons and many others most Maimonides scholars emphasize the intellectual incom patibility of the two systems which (Leo Strauss disagrees with this) Maimonides could not fully face. He was a deeply committed Jew but he also believed that philoso phy had demonstrated certain truths which could not be denied and to which Judaism had to adjust. He made Judaism adjust to the "truths" of philosophy by interpreting non literally those Biblical passages which in their plain meaning con flicted with the truth of Aristotle. Preeminent among these was the incorporeality of God which was philosophically necessary but which conflicted with many anthropo morphic passages in the Bible, all of which Maimonides proceeded to interpret non-Iiterally. The biblically commanded cult of sacrifice was another embarrass ment to Maimonides which he explained away as not something truly demanded by God but as a concession to primitive man who could not be made to part with his primitive habits too quickly. In short, the majority position is that the effort of Maimonides is a noble attempt that failed because it at tempted to reconcile what could not be reconciled. And now we return to Hartman's book. Where does he stand on this question? Does he think that these two systems of thought—Torah 107</page><page sequence="4">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought and medieval Anstotehanism—can or cannot be reconciled? I think he thinks they can be reconciled. But then again I am not sure what he thinks because his book, on one level, is strictly historical. It seems to be an exposition of Maimoni des' mind, of the way he saw things and of the reasons he thought Torah and philosophy were com patible. Read strictly in this sense, there is nothing I can disagree with. patible with Judaism and not phi losophy as a whole even though for Maimonides philosophy was equated with medieval Aristotelianism. There is no question that Mai monides thought Torah and phi losophy were compatible for the reasons Hartman cites. But does Hartman think that this is a viable position? I think he does think so but he does not quite say so. I suspect that he learned from Shlomo Pines, who writes a fore word to the book, that one must remain within the frame of refer ence of an author and attempt to understand him as he understood himself. In the guise of so doing, Hartman writes a brief for an en lightened contemporary Orthodoxy which pursues the path of synthesis that Maimonides had legitimized. In the process of so doing, he seems to lose sight of the fact that in the case çf Maimonides it is not the enterprise of synthesis as such that is on trial but the specific synthesis of Judaism with medieval Aristotelianism, a philosophy which is hardly a living option today. Even if this particular synthesis is a failure, it may be possible to develop out of Jewish sources a far more subtle notion of ration ality than that of Aristotle. If that is so, it would be some particular philosophies that would be incom What, according to Hartman, enabled Maimonides to integrate Judaism and philosophy? "The in tegration of philosophy and Juda ism," writes Hartman (pp. 66-67), "was made possible by the talmu dic tradition." Were Maimonides' Judaism exclusively biblical, his task of integrating it with philoso phy would be far more difficult if not impossible. But because Juda ism "was not defined solely by the Bible but included the vast corpus of talmudic writing," the task be comes manageable. The key to Maimonides' enterprise is the non literal interpretation of the Bible which, according to Hartman, is legitimized by the Talmud. It has often been pointed out that classical Judaism cannot be termed "fundamentalist" because, by believing in both a written and oral Torah, the rabbis are not bound by the literal meaning of the verse since it is supplemented by the oral tradition. Once the literal stranglehold of the text is broken, Maimonides can proceed to perform the philosophically necessary corrections. One of the examples Hartman adduces con cerns the transformation of the messianic into the notion of olam ha-bah. In the Bible, obedience to God is rewarded by health, peace and prosperity while disobedience is punished by its opposites. Mai monides finds all this a far too carnal scenario and he therefore spiritualized the messianic, which 108</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews holds out the promise of reward in this world, for olam ha-bah which is a spiritual dwelling with God in the afterlife and therefore far more compatible with the Aris totelian understanding of the virtue of the contemplative, non-material life. There are thus two ways of curing what ails man: the this worldly and the other-worldly. The messianic is the this-worldly. It projects a series of events to occur in this world which will transform human existence into what it should be. The other-worldly route speaks of a disembodied human existence after death in which the soul will commune with God but which will not take place in this world and in history. It is obvious that of the two options, the other-worldly, non-corporeal option is the one that finds favor in the eyes of medieval Aristotelianism and there fore of Maimonides. being returned to it? The best that can be done for resurrection is therefore to ignore it, which is largely what Maimonides did for most of his life. Gradually, criti cism alleging that Maimonides did not believe in the resurrection be gan to be heard and therefore, near the end of his life, he composed a treatise on the subject. In this treatise he concludes that while there will be a resurrection of the dead, after the dead had been resurrected they will die once again, this time to co-exist spiritually with God forever. It is, of course, diffi cult to resist asking what all the trouble was for? If the ultimate desired state is a non-corporeal, spiritual one, why not leave the soul in that state after its first death? What is the purpose of the corporeal interlude? In any case, here is a good example of Judaism and Aristotelianism at war in the soul of Maimonides with the Aris totelian winning out at the end even if a temporary concession to the Jewish must be made. Hart man does not address himself at all to this strange Maimonidean teaching on resurrection. At this point one would like to ask Maimonides and Hartman whether the spiritualizing route is such a clear improvement. Is it the authentic teaching of Judaism? Let us look at the issue of resur rection where the question is very clearly joined. Jewish sources teach the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. From the medieval Aristotelian point of view, the promise of resurrection of the body is a deep embarrassment. If the whole pur pose of the philosophical life is to get rid of the body, what sort of favor is man being shown when, having finally extricated himself from the body, he is to be re warded with the good fortune of What is even more surprising is Hartman's failure to deal with Maimonides' central interest: his denial of all attributes to God. At first the emphasis is on denying the literal applicability of corpo real attributes to God but this is soon left behind and the ban is extended to all attributes, forcing Maimonides into his negative the ology according to which we can only say what God is not and never what he is. The result of all 109</page><page sequence="6">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought this is a God who is far more acceptable to Aristotle than the God of the Bible. But is this an improvement from the Jewish point of view? common with the rabbis the non literal interpretation of the Bible, this is only a formal and not a substantive tie. While Hartman barely mentions the whole question of Divine at tributes, he realizes very clearly that the hermeneutical key to Maimonides' philosophical rein terpretation of Judaism, as we have already seen, is the freedom to interpret the Biblical text non literally which he derived from the rabbis of the Talmud. It is, as we have also seen, true that rabbinic Judaism and its belief in the oral law makes the non-literal interpre tation of the written law possible. But Hartman fails to observe that non-literal interpretation of the Bible is merely a tool which can be used for many different pur poses. The point is that Maimoni des uses it to make Judaism far more compatible with medieval Aristotelianism than it is while the rabbis of the Talmud had no such agenda on their minds. The proof of this is the issue of anthropo morphism. The rabbis, if anything, added to the anthropomorphism of the Bible while Maimonides uses the non-literal interpretation of the Bible to transform the God of Israel into something approaching the philosophic Absolute. There is not the slightest evidence that the rabbis felt in the least uncomfort able with the human way in which the Bible speaks of God. The rab binic midrashim elaborate on the Biblical anthropomorphisms in the most unself-conscious way possible. So while Maimonides may have in In a generic sense, Maimonides' weakness from the Jewish point of view was his insensitivity to the corporeal and the historical. The cult of sacrifice was a low order of Divine service for him. Prayer approximated more closely the in tellectual love of God to which he was devoted and therefore sacri fice was interpreted as a Divine concession forced upon God by the requirements of good pedagogy which rules out sudden breaks. Only because the children of Israel were accustomed to pagan sacri fice did God, according to Mai monides, permit them to continue this objectionable rite, at the same time limiting the practice to the Temple instead of abolishing it altogether. We have already spoken of the difficulties forced on him by the idea of resurrection. The land of Israel is another case in point. One cannot help noticing the relative neglect that the land suffers in his thinking. To the degree necessary he finds the space in his legal code to cover the relevant regula tions. But from a theological point of view the promise of the land hardly plays a role. Examples of the decorporealization of Judaism can be multiplied at considerable length. To Hartman, all this is ac ceptable without protest as if the philosophical "truths" which Mai monides is defending were still defensible. He seems quite oblivi ous to the fact that the very idea 110</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews We are living in a period of the re-historicization of Judaism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was easy to identify Judaism with the ethical—the final form of the rational that Maimonides thought was the product of philosophy. If the essence of Judaism was the ethical, then Berlin could become Jerusalem, provided that one was behaving ethically in Berlin. But we have learned that behavior in Berlin was not as ethical as the Berlin Jewish philosophers thought and that only Jerusalem is Jeru salem. For us, the carnal holiness of substantive truths of reason which were beyond debate and to which Judaism or any other reli gion must adjust or perish is hardly an idea with much contem porary currency. I must reiterate that these criticisms are cogent only if Hartman is expressing his agreement with the Maimonidian enterprise rather than merely re porting it. But if he is merely reporting the conviction of Mai monides that Torah and medieval Aristotelianism were compatible, he is not telling the informed reader anything that he does not already know. of the Western Wall reopens the question of sacrifices. If we feel a proximity to God in Jerusalem and on the Temple Mount that we feel nowhere else and this two thousand years after the cessation of sacri fice, then it must be necessary to re-think the de-carnalization of Judaism that is the philosophic but not the halakhic enterprise of Maimonides. And because we are once again in history, we may have to learn that rabbinic Judaism is not to be separated from biblical Judaism with the relish with which Hartman does. The carnal-histori cal basis of Judaism is in the process of stirring and the demand of the hour may be a re-discovery of Yehudah Hale vi and his meta physics of history rather than Mai monides and his metaphysics of being.
