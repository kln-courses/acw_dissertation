<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Issue of Readiness in the Design and Organization of the Curriculum: A Historical Perspective Edmund V. Sullivan In order to frame this paper in a proper educational perspective, it may be said that the concept of readiness in the curriculum has been historically and is now one of the more polemical and controversial molecular issues in education. The term molecular is purposely used so that the reader will know that more molar educational issues take precedence over this question before the problem of readiness is even entertained. The role of the school in contemporary society, its educational objectives, the ques- tion of the moral limits of its influence, are but a few examples of the molar considerations which take priority over the ques- tion of "readiness" in curriculum planning. Thus far, it has been implicitly assumed that the reader already understands the term "readiness;" this is somewhat unfair, since one of the purposes of this paper is to clarify some of the reasons why it is a con- troversial term. In a sense, the reader's common sense definition of "readiness" is relied on, which, probably, in whole or in part, can be found in Webster's dictionary. The word "ready" is defined by Webster's generally as follows: - prepare or supply with what is needed for some act or event; - suited or arranged for immedate use; - immediately liable; likely; - willing; disposed; - dextrous; expert; etc. "Readiness" is a noun briefly defined as follows: - quality of being ready; promptness; alacrity; - state or fact of being ready. When these terms are extrapolated into their educational context, they obviously need a certain degree of precison on the part of the user if confusion is to be circumvented. This attempt at precision has not been demonstrated, in general, in educational circles; and this is probably one of the reasons why the polemics and controversy still crop up in contemporary educational theorizing. When the concept of "readiness" is used in educational curriculum planning, it is entrenched in implicit philosophical and psychological assumptions concerning the con- The author thanks Mrs. Diane Hansen for the typing of this manuscript and is indebted to Mrs. Mary Stager for her critical comments and editorial assistance.

It will be shown, for example, that when a scholar such as Piaget, coming from a Kantian tradition, faces a NeoBehaviorist, coming from a British Associationist tradition, on the issue of "readiness," their con- troversy concerning this term stems from a long philosophical and psychological battle about the definition of knowledge itself, among other things. In its simplest form, no one would argue with Tyler's (1964) definition that "readiness" deals generically with the issue "when to teach;" in other words, it is first of all a temporal problem in curriculum planning. The difficulty ensues when different philosophical and psychological theories prescribe different times and different modes of attain- ment of a body of knowledge. It is here that the concept of "readiness" takes on different definitions, in accordance with the implicit assumptions of the theory within which the educa- tional planner is operating. The attempt here will be to make explicit some of the implicit theories involved, and to show how they lead to opposing conclusions concerning the "when of learning" in a curriculum. The treatment will not be exhaustive, and the reader is referred to Tyler's (1964) excellent article on the same topic to see some of the "uses" and "misuses" of the concept of readiness that have taken place historically in American education. Readiness and the Concept of Mind When the discussion of readiness to learn is introduced in the pacing of a curriculum, one frequently finds that expert advice is sought from the discipline of psychology. Specifically, the areas of developmental psychology, learning theory and psychometry have, at one time or another, addressed themselves to the concept of readiness in curriculum programming. In spite of the fact that all these experts are psychologists, it has become obvious that different types of theories of development, learning and measurement have issued different prescriptions concerning readiness to learn - because they have vastly different con- ceptions of mind and how the mind assimilates information. In fact, some theories of psychology (e.g., radical behaviorism) deny the very concept of mind; but there are historical reasons for such a development, and when these are elaborated, the present topic may be more fully understood. In a sense, the use of the term psychology is a misnomer in much of what is now known as modern psychology. The study (logos) of the soul (psyche) from its Greek origins honored a distinction or dualism between body and mind, but this dis- tinction has been obliterated in many contemporary psychological theories. To some extent, this distinction of mind and body depends on whether the theorist thinks that the human person can be studied as a natural phenomenon, following laws similar to those followed by phenomena in the other physical sciences (e.g., physics). This development was continued in the writing of Rene Descartes, and specifically in his thoughts concerning the mind-body dualism. Descartes contended that reality involved two exclusive dimensions, that of extension and thought. Man partially participated in both these dimensions, in Descartes' view, for he was a creature composed of both spiritual (mind) and corporeal (body) properties. The mental dimension of man was exemplified in such human activities as thinking, imagining, willing being conscious, feeling, and so forth. The corporeal dimension was exemplified in such activities as breathing, diges- EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970 39</page><page sequence="2">tion and other non-cognitive aspects of human existence. Descartes attempted to unify this dualism by postulating their interaction in the pineal gland. This unification was unsuccessful, because his theory of mind-body interaction was never taken seriously. More important here, however, are Descartes' views on how both mind and body were to be understood and explain- ed. It was his conviction that man's corporeal existence could be explained by natural mechanical explanations, such as those given in the natural sciences of his day. This meant that bodily existence was determined by mechanistic laws that govern all bodies occupying space. Because of Descartes' religious convic- tions, the mind of man was considered free and not subject, as the body was, to the laws of natural phenomena. The exclusion of the mind from the mechanistic world in a sense renamed psychology as a contender in the natural sciences. In the history of psychology up to contemporary times, three is a desperate attempt to consider this discipline a natural science; much of modern psychology has veered toward the explanation of all man's activities in naturalistic, mechanistic terms. The advent of behaviorism saw the total rejection of mind as a construct worthy of consideration, and, with Watson, the proper study of psychology became man's observed behavior, which was explainable by totally naturalistic means. Mind keeps creeping back, however, in the guise of intervening variables and hypo- thetical constructs and the probable reason for this is that, as fuzzy as the concept may be, it nevertheless emerges when theorists are honestly trying to understand many aspects of man's existence. The 1960's saw a resurgence of old philosophical questions initiated by Descartes, and the view that psychology is a natural science consisting of mechanistic explanations has been the sub- ject of attack in many sophisticated theoretical circles. Sigmund Koch (1964) has challenged the primacy and importance of psychology's being a natural science, and has severely criticized the contribution of behaviorism in its explanation and concept- tion of man. Chomsky (1968) has launched a similar attack in his consideration of language development, and has rejected mechanical explanations of language acquisition. He reintroduces the concept of mind, and traces his theoretical concerns back to Descartes. He maintains that the study of mind presents us with a problem of quality of complexity, and not merely one of degree of complexity. The phenomena of language cannot be explained by physical science strategies any more than can man's thought processes. Without further elaboration on these issues, it is hoped that the sense of controversy has been conveyed. But why present this controversy? What does it have to do with educational readiness? This seems a long and circuitous route to travel, but if it is kept in mind that much of contem- porary learning theory develops out of behavioristic psychology, it may be said that when the concept of "readiness" is tied to this tradition, it is implicitly operating from a distinct philosophical tradition with strong adherents and strong detractors in contem- porary psychology. To give a more complete picture of psychological influences on education, it is important to note that behaviorism has not reigned supreme. Although Thorndike (1932) wielded a heavy influence on educational planning, Dewey provided many educa- tional theorists and practitioners with an alternative view of the mind which was sympathetic to the Gestalt tradition in psy- chology (McDonald, 1964). Whereas behaviorism drew from the "British Associationists" philosophical tradition, as illustrated in the work of Locke, Berkeley and Hume, the Gestaltists' philosophical source was the "Continental European" tradition, exemplified by Kant. The Kantian tradition emphasized the mind side of the Cartesian dualism, whereas the British Asso- ciationists ventured out on its opposite counterpart. The two traditions have vastly different conceptions of the development and learning process as well as opposing conceptions of knowl- edge. Although it will be rough at the edges, an attempt will be made to show how different educational metaphors and their historical antecedents have led to different conceptions of learn- ing and development in contemporary educational psychology. These conceptions are partially traceable to the different con- ceptions of man as previously discussed. It will be seen that the concept of readiness takes on different parameters depending on the educational metaphor and psychological theory that is being applied. Two conceptions of human development are initially pertinent here: (1) preformationistic and predeter- ministic conceptions of development, and (2) Tabula Rasa conceptions of development (Ausubel &amp; Sullivan, 1970). Preformationistic and Predeterministic Concepts of Development Preformationist Approaches. The fundamental thesis of pre- formationism is a denial of the essential occurrence and im- portance of development in human ontogeny (Ausubel &amp; Sulli- van, 1970). The basic properties and behavioral capacities of man - his personality, values and motives, his perceptual, cognitive, emotional and social reaction tendencies - are not considered to be undergoing qualitative differentiation and trans- formation over the life span, but are presumed to exist pre- formed at birth. Nothing need develop as a result of the inter- action between a largely undifferentiated organism with certain stipulated predispositions and his particular environment. In- stead, everything is already prestructured, and either undergoes quantitative modification with increasing age or merely unfolds sequentially on a prearranged schedule. The concept of readiness is vitiated under preformationistic conceptions because there is no postulation of organism-environment interaction since development is denied in the growth process. Historical antecedents. The origins of preformationistic thinking stem from theological conceptions of man and certain innate givens in his nature (e.g., Original Sin). An early em- bryological theory is found in the homuncular theory of human reproduction and prenatal gestation. The homuncular theory rested on the belief that a miniature but well-formed little man (i.e., homunculus) was embodied in the sperm, and when em- planted in the uterus simply grew to bulk, without any disorienta- tion of tissue or organs, until full-term fetal size was attained at the end of nine months. Educationally, the disposition to perceive the infant or child as a miniature adult is largely an outgrowth of the ubiquitous tendency toward extrapolation or anthropomorphism in interpreting phenomena remote from one's own experience or familiar explanatory models. The theological variety of preformationism, allied as it was to a conception of man as innately sinful, inspired a rigid, authoritarian and pessi- mistic approach to education (Ausubel &amp; Sullivan, 1970). Since ultimate form was assumed to be prestructured and com- plete in all of its essential aspects, one could at best only improve slightly on what the individual already was or was fated to be- come. Hence, it was not necessary to consider the child's 40 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970</page><page sequence="3">developmental needs and status, the conditions propitious for development at a given stage of maturity, or readiness for partic- ular experience. Readiness was considered irrelevant as a con- cept, because the child was not perceived as qualitatively different from the adult or as making any significant contribution to his own development. The arbitrary imposition of adult standards was regarded as self-evidently defensible. Fortunately, there are no contemporary counterparts of the approach in modern education. Predeterministic Approaches. In contradiction to preformation- ism, predeterministic conceptions of growth satisfy the minimal criteria for a developmental approach. Successive stages of the organism are not merely regarded as reflective of a sequential unfolding of preformed structures or functions forever fixed at conception or birth, but as the outcome of a process, of qualita- tive differentiation or evolution of form. Nevertheless, because the regulation of development is considered as so prepotently determined by internal factors, the net effect is much the same as if preformationism were assumed. Interaction with the envi- ronment and the latter's influence on the course of development is not completely ruled out, but its directional role is so sharply curtailed that it never crucially affects eventual outcome, account- ing at the very most for certain minor limiting or patterning effects. Historical antecedents. The first definitive predeterministic theory of child development was articulated by the French phi- losopher Rousseau (1712-1778). Rousseau postulated that all development consists of a series of internally regulated sequential stages, which are transformed one into the other in conformity with a prearranged order and design (Rousseau, 1895). Accord- ing to this conception of development, the only proper role of the environment is avoidance of serious interference with the processes of self-regulation and maturation. It facilitates develop- ment, best, not by imposing restrictions or setting coercive goals and standards, but by providing a maximally permissive field in which, unhampered by the limiting and distortive influences of external constraints, the predetermined outcomes of growth are optimally realized. Consistent with this orientation was Rousseau's belief that the child is innately good, that society constitutes the source of all evil, and that a return to a less inhibited and less socially restrictive method of child rearing would necessarily result in the unfolding of the individual's in- herently wholesome and virtuous development proclivities. Im- plicit in the above is the educational growth metaphor of the plant ( Schef fier, 1960). The metaphor is expressed in the parallels between the growing child and the growing plant and between the gardener and the teacher. As Scheffler points out, in both cases, the developing organism goes through stages of development that are relatively independent of the efforts of the gardener as teacher. In both gardening and teaching the objective is to help the organism flourish and care for its welfare by pro- viding optimum conditions for the operations of laws of nature (Scheffler, 1960). Readiness from the teacher's standpoint is irrelevant here, since the timing is an endogenous organismic factor governed by the organism and not dependent on the environment. The educational implications of these doctrines may also be found in the educational writings of such men as Pestalozzi and Froebel; and, in more recent times, the writings of Neill on his Summerhill experiment. The philosophical antecedents of predeterministic theories have psychological counterparts in the writings of Mall (1904) and of Gesell and his followers (Gesell, 1933; Gesell &amp; lig, 1943). Since Gesell's position has more obvious implications for the educational concept of readiness, it seems appropriate to discuss parts of his theoretical position on the concept of devel- opment. In a sense, Gesell's theory of maturation reiterates Rousseau's emphasis upon the internal control of development (Ausubel &amp; Sullivan, 1970). Gesell's theory capitalized on its general resemblance to the empirically demonstrable concept of maturation, which had gained considerable acceptance among behavior scientists, educators and the lay public. Actually, the latter concept dealt with non-learning (as distinguished from the learning) contributions to enhancement in capacity, rather than with the more general issue of the relative importance of internal and external regulation in development irrespective of the role of learning. Operationally it merely referred to increments in func- tional capacity attributable to structural growth, physiological change or the cumulative impact of incidental experience (i.e., learning). Gesell, however, used the term maturation in a very special and more global sense to represent the endogenous regu- latory mechanisms responsible for determining the essential direc- tion of all development, including that conditioned in part by learning and enculturation. Gesell ( 1933) theorized that develop- mental sequences are relatively invariable in all areas of growth, evolve more or less spontaneously and inevitably, and show basic uniformities even in strikingly different cultural settings. The role of the environment is relegated to a subsidiary function, merely supporting, inflecting and modifying but not generating the progressions of development. Since development follows an endogenous organismic timetable, the concept of readiness is relegated to a status similar to that found in Rousseau's philo- sophical position (see Gesell &amp; Ilg, 1943). In other words, the organism itself takes care of readiness. Contemporary counterparts. The most important contem- porary theory with a posture toward predeterminism is the Piagetian stage model of cognitive development. Piaget's use of the term "stage of development" implicitly adheres to the notion that, as age is changing, the organism has at its disposal different intrinsic structures which enable it to process information in different ways. In theory, the concrete-abstract dimension that Piaget describes is attributed to these changing intrinsic struc- tures. In order to assess the presence of a "stage," Piaget has deliberately questioned children on concepts that are sponta- neously learned rather than directly taught in the school. If there are developmental differences in the way children view the world, it is wise to tap these structural differences by using concepts in which they cannot mimic adult responses. Thus, the use of questions which probe the child's spontaneous (versus learned) concepts guards against the child's giving information learned by rote, and, in this sense, enables one to see if there are differences between children's adult reasoning. Even a cur- sory reading of Piaget will establish the fact that this strategy has been a profitable endeavor. The use of Piaget's stages as "readiness" indicators was first suggested by Hunt (1961) in his discussion of "matching" the environmental circumstances to the child's conceptual abilities. As Hunt points out, Piaget has frequently alluded to the im- portance of basing educational practice on the natural phases of the child's interaction with the environment, but he has only hinted at the principle that environmental circumstances force accommodative modifications in the child's cognitive structure. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970 41</page><page sequence="4">Some writers feel that Piaget's work has educational merit because it is important that there be an appropriate "match" between the circumstances that a child encounters and his present state of conceptual development. The description of the stages of intellectual develop- ment provided by Piaget are extremely helpful in the matching process as it is seen in a grosser sense. The periods between the various behavioral landmarks that mark Piaget's transitions or stages are, in a sense, "critical periods" for various types of environmental encounters (Hunt, 1961, P. 273). In the past several years, educational extrapolators of Piaget have attempted to deal with the "matching" hypothesis in practical curriculum prescriptions. For instance, Adler (1963) has suggested that if one follows Piagetian stages in planning curriculum, the world initially must be defined in terms of action- linked concepts, with the child encountering knowledge through his own actions (i.e., sensor i-motor). During the stage of con- crete operations, the teacher must deal with materials in terms of concrete samples; and, finally, the stage of formal operations allows the presentation of less concrete and more theoretical material. This interprteation of Piaget's stages puts his normative sequences in a prescriptive context; that is, the stages of cognitive development in some way prescribe how the learning should take place at different levels of cognitive maturity. In a sense, it is hinting at the readiness of learning experiences in a particular subject matter area. Before expanding on the notion of readiness for subject matter, it is necessary to consider Piaget's definition of readiness. Piaget identifies the concept of readiness as synony- mous with maturation (i.e., genie unfolding). His dichotomy between learning and development (Piaget, 1964) places his notion of "readiness" clearly on the side of some type of matura- tional unfolding. Piaget also states that learning cannot explain development but that stage of development can, in part, explain learning. Thus in Almy, Chittenden and Miller (1966), he states in the preface that: Development follows its own laws, as all of the con- temporary biology leads us to believe, and although each stage in the development is accompanied by all sorts of new learning based on experience, this learn- ing is always relative to the developmental period during which it takes place, and the intellectual struc- tures, whether completely or partially formed, which the subject has at his disposal during this period. In the last analysis, therefore, development accounts for learning much more than the other way around (1966, p. 5). Piaget's educational position is quite similar to Dewey's, in the sense that the curriculum is to be geared to the child's cognitive level and not the converse. If learning should be geared to the child's present developmental level as Piaget insists, then the problem of "matching" the subject matter to the growing conceptual abilities of the child (i.e., his present cognitive struc- ture) is a relevant consideration. Hunt (1961) maintains that when cognitive structure and subject matter are "mismatched" the learning experience is impeded and slowed down. It is, therefore, important that the changes in teaching strategy be based on changes that take place at critical points in the Piagetian scheme of development. The educational stress has thus far focused on the changes that take place between Piaget's stages of pre-operational, concrete operational and formal operational thought. It is interesting to note that they take place roughly at the periods of transition from nursery to elementary and from elementary to secondary schools (Sullivan, 1968). Several edu- cators and psychologists have specifically applied Piagetian stages as indicators of "readiness" to learn in such areas as physics, mathematics and the social sciences and their attempts are critically evaluated elsewhere (Sullivan, 1967, 1969). For the moment, let us focus on the predeterministic elements in Piaget- ian theory, because of its obvious implications for the concept of readiness and its practical educational import within this theoretical orientation. Piaget shares with other "stage formulations" of develop- ment the problem of attributing the ongoing stage changes to some kind of genie unfolding. If taken seriously, a predeter- ministic position underlays the value of educational intervention and in many instances relegates it to a minor role in the devel- opment process. As discussed previously, Gesell (1954), in American psychology, exemplified predeterminism by attributing the development of his stages of motor and social development to genie unfolding of biological structures. Gesell theorized that developmental sequences are relatively invariable in all areas of growth, evolve more or less spontaneously and inevitably, and show basic uniformities even in strikingly different cultural set- tings (Ausubel &amp; Sullivan, 1970). The effects of environment are only indirectly felt and its role is to support, inflect and specify, but not to engender, the basic forms and sequences of ontogenesis (Gesell, 1954). It is clear that Piaget's consistent reiteration of the func- tional invariants of assimilation and accommodation (Hunt, 1969), as well as his emphasis on the effects of social experi- ence (Piaget, 1964; Sigei, 1968), distinguishes his theory from Gesell's, at least in emphasis. Relative to Gesell, he is less a predeterminist along a predeterminist-interaction continuum, but is it valid to say that he is a full blown interactionist (see Hunt, 1969)? It is contended here that, in some ways, Piaget has invited being labelled as at least a modified predeterminist. It can be said without exaggeration that: Piaget . . . tends to ignore the effects of antecedent conditions and the environmental variables in develop- ment, relegating them to a place of definitely sub- sidiary importance to the unfolding of internal struc- tures. This does not mean that he advocates a strict nativist position, for he has frequently emphasized the continual interaction between external and internal forces. Nevertheless, biological orientation and interest in structure leads him to take external factors for granted and to regard the form which this interaction takes as largely predetermined from the start. The only problem, then, is that of specifying the successive stages through which the organism passes; little lee- way is left for differential manifestations of external conditions (Wohlwill, 1962). This "little leeway" is seen in his complete lack of emphasis on direct educational intervention. In fact, it is in the statements that Piaget has made to educators that he is found most vulner- able to the accusation of predeterminism. This drawback is seen in his insistence on the dichotomy between development and learning. In considering the development of knowledge, Piaget (1964) has said the following: The development of knowledge is a spontaneous pro- 42 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970</page><page sequence="5">cess, tied to the whole process of embryogenesis. Em- bryogenesis concerns the development of the body, but it concerns as well the development of the nervous system, and the development of mental functions. In the case of the development of knowledge in children, embryogenesis ends only in adulthood. It is a total developmental process which we must resituate in its general biological and psychological context. In other words, development is a process which concerns the totality of the structures of knowledge (p. 8) Piaget (1964) points out further a distinction between learning and development. For Piaget, learning should be con- sidered as distinct from development: Learning presents the opposite case. In general, learn- ing is provoked by situations - provoked by a psy- chological experimenter or by a teacher, with respect to some didactic point, or by an external situation. It is provoked, in general, as opposed to spontaneous. In addition, it is a limited process - limited to a single problem or to a single structure (p. 8). The reader will note that his concept of development is a spontan- eous process tied to embryogenesis, while learning is provoked by external situations. Like Gesell, he notes that embryogenesis concerns bodily development, but also the nervous system and mental functions; thus development is a process which concerns the totality of the structures of knowledge. In Piaget's frame- work, learning is a more restricted process which is provoked by situations (e.g., teaching) and is limited to single problems or single structures. The classification of Piaget as predominantly a predeterminist (Ausubel &amp; Sullivan, 1970), which seems rather shocking when one considers the factors he outlines for stage transition, can be justified because of the prime importance and prominence which he attributes to the equilibration factor. Piaget and his followers (e.g., Smedslund, 1961) deny that specific learning experience or training (practice), particularly of a verbal nature, or for that matter, education generally, has any significant influence on the emergence of stages of intellectual development. Vygotsky (1965) appears to have driven to the very heart of this rigid dichotomy when he discusses Piaget's notions of spontaneous concepts (i.e., concepts that develop through equilibration) and non-spontaneous concepts (i.e., con- cepts that are learned from external sources) : There are errors in Piaget's reasoning that detract from the value of his views. Although he holds that the child in forming a concept stamps it with the charac- teristic of his own mentality, Piaget tends to apply this thesis only to spontaneous concepts and assumes that they alone can truly enlighten us on the special qualities of child thought; he fails to see the interaction between the two kinds of concepts and the bonds that unite them into a total system of concepts in the course of the child's intellectual development (Vygot- sky, 1965, p. 84). The educational problem with a stage theory such as Piaget's involves relating the notion of "intrinsic structure" to the ongoing teaching-learning situation. This linking of the educational strategy to stage of development is complicated by the fact that Piaget in his research has attempted to keep them separate. One of the difficult educational dilemmas with Piaget's work is due to the tremendous stress that he places on spontaneous concept formation, while paying relatively minor attention to the formal concepts that are learned in school (Vygotsky, 1965). In this sense, the theory ignores the inter- action between school-learned concepts and intrinsic structure (stage). With Piaget, "stage of development" affects the learn- ing of school concepts but the reverse does not obtain. Aebil (in Kohnstamm, 1966) notes this stumbling block to making Piaget's developmental psychology fruitful for education: If Piaget in his developmental experiments demon- strates that at a certain age a certain operation exists, it does not have to be taught anymore. However, if the child does not yet have the operation at his disposal it cannot be taught (p. 3). Kohnstamm (1966) views this as the basic problem with Piaget's theory for a number of reasons. The first is Piaget's belief that experiences in daily life are necessary for development, and that the child learns gradually from his own spontaneous experiences. There is no place in the theory for the systematic teaching of thought structures. The second reason is bound up with the fact that, for Piaget, the child's activity, not his language, is the main factor in cognitive development: In Piaget's view the social transmission of spoken language is not essential for the formation of opera- tional structures. Therefore, all the words a teacher might use in trying to explain a certain Piagetian problem to the child are considered useless. If the child has had the necessary experience he will discover the insight into the problem all in due time; if he has not, the only thing a teacher can do is to teach the child to recite the rules parrot-wise without real under- standing (Kohnstamm, 1966, pp. 3-4). As will be pointed out later, a more generic conception of "cognitive readiness" can be considered without violating the assumptions of stage theories. This conception simultaneously considers maturation (genie) and prior learnings without treat- ing them as discrete parts. The emphasis on learning as one of the necessary conditions for particular "stage of development" gives the educator greater latitude in experimenting with new subject matter if it is related to the previously learned subject matter. The formulation of Piaget's stage theory is of such a restrictive nature that in regard to the notion of "readiness" the temporal prescription is to simply wait for self-regulation to take place. Tabula Rasa Conceptions of Development In marked contrast to the preformationist and predeter- ministic doctrines of development which have been discussed is the "tabula rasa" position, which is derived from historical antecedents in "British Associationism" and has as its modern- day educational derivative approaches such as Behaviorism and Neo-Behaviorism. If the former (i.e., preformationist and pre- deterministic) approaches are considered as constituting one extreme of a continuum embracing various theories concerned with the regulation of human development, the latter ideological movements would have to be placed at the other extreme of the same continuum. They are referred to as " tabula rasa " (literally, "blank slate") approaches because they minimize the contribu- tions of genie endowment and of directional factors coming from within the individual, and concomitantly emphasize the preeminent role of the environment in determining the outcome of development. The analogy which likens the neonate to a EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970 43</page><page sequence="6">tabula rasa is aptly representative of their general thesis that no fundamental predispositions are inherent in the raw material from which behavior and personality develop, that human beings are infinitely malleable. All of the patterning, differen- tiation, integration and elaboration of specific and general be- havioral content that emerges during the course of development is accounted for in terms of the unique stimulus conditions to which the individual is or has been subjected (Ausubel &amp; Sulli- van, 1970). It should be noted, however, that the term "tabula rasa" is being used here in a very general sense, to denote extreme environmentalist positions such as those described above. In the more specific sense of the term, as employed by John Locke, the "blank slate" only referred to the ideational state of affairs at birth and not to the complete absence of developmental pre- dispositions; as a matter of fact, in his discourses on education he placed much emphasis on the need for restraining the natural impulses of children. Furthermore, in the light of modern con- ceptions of cognitive and behavioral development, Locke's tabula rasa proposition cannot be regarded as indicative of an extreme position with respect to the nature-nurture controversy. Historical antecedents . Consistent with and building upon the "British Associationist" philosophical tradition, behaviorism as a movement in American psychology extended the tabula rasa position by emphasizing the behavioral plasticity of the organism and by denying subjective experience (except as a form of subliminal behavior). It rejected all developmental predispositions (except for reflexes and certain emotional re- sponses) and conceptualized the human organism as a noncogni- tive response mechanism subservient to the control of conditioned stimuli (Watson, 1919). Similarly, in the area of child care and education, its advocacy of impersonal handling, strictness, regu- larity, and the importance of habit training was strikingly reminiscent of preformationist practices (Watson, 1928). In- plicit in the above position is the educational growth metaphor of shaping (Scheffler, 1960). The metaphor is expressed in the parallels between the growing child as clay and the teacher as the molder or shaper of the clay from amorphous to specific forms. When this metaphor is being employed, the teacher's initiative, power and responsibility are brought into sharp focus (Scheffler, 1969). In line with "tabula rasa" conceptions of behavioral plasticity, the final shape of the clay is wholly a product of the teacher's choice of a given mold. Readiness, in this tradition, is a function of the teacher's initiative, with the child's inherent growth processes being generally ignored or skirted. The earliest American proponent of the "Associationist" tradition in educational psychology was Edward Thorndike (1932). Thorndike viewed the learning situation as an asso- ciation between sense impressions (stimuli) and dispositions to action (responses). These bands or associations or connections between stimuli and responses are strengthened by reinforcement or satisfaction and practice. Knowledge, for Thorndike, was the accumulation of these stimulus-response connections. Thorndike propounded a peculiar law of readiness which was grounded in physiological terms. Readiness had a physiological base in his postulation of a "conduction unit" which had to be ready to conduct if a connection or association was to be made. The law was quite vague and circular, and it sheds no light on the topic of readiness that is being dealt with in this paper. Nevertheless, the general thrust of Thorndike's educational theorizing indicates that readiness for learning is a matter of making the correct connections in the appropriate order with the accompani- ment of a satisfying state of affairs (reward). There are few restrictions placed on the capacity of the organism and the teacher's role is to reward correct connections when they occur. Thorndike's position is quite in line with the behavioristic thesis that knowledge and its acquisition is a matter of building up and rewarding stimulus-response connections. Skinner's (1968) con- ception of the learning process is one of the more current extra- polations of this viewpoint. Along with Thorndike, Skinner is quite optimistic about the plasticity of the organism for learning, as long as reinforcement takes place. Contemporary counterparts. More pertinent to the present topic is the concept of "readiness" as propounded by the educa- tional technologist Gagné (Gagné, 1968). It would be unfair to say that he is a behaviorist (although he adopts some forms of their learning), yet his position is very closely aligned to the "British Associationist" view of knowledge acquisition. He is discussed here because he attempts to define "readiness" in quite different terms from Piaget, and this provides an interesting contrast in viewpoint. Gagné (1968) starts out to explicate his conception of "readiness" by distinguishing between two general processes, learning and development. Learning involves changes in behavior capabilities with respect to relatively specific forms of behavior, usually over relatively limited periods of time (i.e., hours, days, weeks) (Gagné, 1968, p. 177). Gagne defines development as another major class of capabilities observed over longer periods of time (i.e., months, years). Gagné (1968) is justifiably disturbed by Piaget's underplaying of the role of learn- ing in developmental change, and offers the following alternative to the Piagetian conception of cognitive development: The point of view I wish to describe here states that learning contributes to intellectual development of the human being because it is cumulative in its effects. The child progresses from one point to the next in his development, not because he acquires one or a dozen new associations, but because he learns an ordered set of capabilities which build upon each other in pro- gressive fashion through the processes of differentia- tion, recall and transition of learning (Gagné, 1968, p. 181). It is clear that Gagné places a marked emphasis on learn- ing in the course of the organism's development. Although he postulates an interaction between genetically determined growth (i.e., maturation) and learning in the developmental progression, it is apparent that learning is paramount in his system, while maturation is simply assumed to be operating. His position attempts to explain the growth processes attributed to "equili- bration" in Piagetian theory in cumulative learning terms. He postulates that all learning is hierarchically organized from simple to more complex forms of learning sequences. Readi- ness in this system is not attributed to maturation or equilibra- tion but to the presence of prerequisite subordinate capabilities which form the foundation for the learning of more complex superordinate capabilities. Readiness appears to be totally inde- pendent of maturational construct, such as is seen in Gesell's work. For Gagné, the organism is ready if it has the necessary subordinate capabilities. The reason that development takes time is not that it is primarily maturationally governed, but simply that subordinate capabilities presented in the correct logical order take time to be learned (Gagné, 1968). Gagné further observes that 44 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970</page><page sequence="7">when growth (development) is the dominant theme, educational events are designed to wait until the child is ready for learning. When learning is the dominant theme, the years are to be sys- tematically filled with planned events of learning, and there is virtually no waiting - except for the time required to bring about those changes. Gagné's criticism of Piageťs position represents a "tabula rasa" approach to the learning experience which virtually rejects the concept of development held by Piaget by making it solely "cumulative experience." It is unfortunate that when the polari- ties are dramatized, the proponents of both positions distort one another's concepts. Under these conditions the writer is sym- pathetic to Piaget when reading Gagné, and that the exact opposite obtains when concentrating on Piageťs prescriptions. As Cronbach (1964) points out: Somewhere between the dual approaches - enrich the environment and let development occur - there would seem logically to be some optimal curriculum of experiences arranged in some predetermined sequence with intervention by the teacher system- atically regulated. But we do not know nearly enough about such questions (p. 77). Gagné (1968) assumes that the answers to such questions lie in a logical "task analysis' ' of the learning situation that is of interest. Although he rejects a simple associationistic conception of learning, it may be safely said that the general position he espouses is a "tabula rasa" approach to development. Dewey's (1956) characterization of the early associationists can be applied with equal force to Gagné's "cumulative learning" position. Subdivide each topic into studies; each study into lessons; each lesson into specific facts and formulae. Let the child proceed step by step to master each one of these separate parts, and at last he will have covered the entire ground. The road which looks so long when viewed in its entirety is easily travelled, considered as a series of particular steps. Thus emphasis is put upon the logical subdivisions and consecutions of the sub- ject-matter. Problems of instruction are problems of procuring texts giving logical parts and sequences, and of presenting these portions in class in a similar defi- nite and graded way. Subject-matter furnishes the end, and it determines method. The child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened; his is narrow experience which is to be widened. It is his to receive, to accept. His part is fulfulled when he is ductile and docile (Dewey, 1956, p. 8). An Inter actionist Approach To recapitulate, the concept of readiness to learn takes on different prescriptions for curriculum programming, depending on the conception of mind and the theory of development within which the theorist operates. The concept of mind and knowledge acquisition are closely linked to the theorist's concept of develop- ment, and there are usually historical precedents for this linkage. Mechanistic explanations of development have generally fallen within the "tabula rasa" conceptions of development wherein content of the mind is very dependent on environmental input. The mind within this context is a "mechanical mirror" (Langer, 1969) in which the child is born empty of psychological con- tent and into a world of coherently organized content. In a sense, the child's mind is like a mirror in which the child comes to reflect his environment. Consistent with our own interpreta- tion is Langer's (1969) historical perspective on the mind as a mechanical mirror: In the history of philosophical thought this thesis has been based upon two central assumptions. The first is that the content of the mind can be analyzed into con- stituent elements. Historically, this meant speculating about the building blocks or atoms, such as impres- sions and images, of which the mind is presumed to be composed . . . The second assumption is that external forces im- pinge upon the child's sensorium and leave elementary impressions. Thus Locke maintained that the mind is an empty slate before sensory impressions mark it. Ideas, as Hume put it, are merely the faint images of these impressions. These images are the elements or simple ideas that make up the mind, and complex ideas are the associations of elementary or simple ideas. We may therefore characterize the growth of the mind from this point of view, as the quantitative accumulation and association of elements supplied by the environment (Pp. 4-5). These two assumptions are present in both Thorndike's and Gagnés concepts of intellectual growth. Non-mechanistic explanations of development have nor- mally fallen within the tradition of "predeterminism," but this is not absolutely necessary, and predeterministic theories have generally given the organism considerable credit for its own growth. Like Kant, Piaget stresses the importance of "structures" which have to be present if knowledge is to be assimilated. Piageťs contribution to this tradition is the postulation of the development of intrinsic structures, whereas within the Kantian tradition there was no development implied. Piageťs model of the mind is quite different from the mechanistic conceptions of knowledge acquisition. Langer (1969) has characterized Piageťs conception of mind and knowledge acquisition as that of an organic lamp. Within this perspective, man is conceived as an active agent in the developmental process. Hopefully it is clear by now that the concept of readiness takes on different parameters depending on the tradition within which the theorist operates. The traditions discussed thus far have emphasized two extreme conceptions of development which make rather different prescriptions about the readiness of the learner for knowledge acquisition. The "tabula rasa" conceptions see the child's mind as essentially a passive sponge, and place considerable emphasis on the teaching input that the environment provides. The "predeterministic" theories have given the organ- ism an active and dominant part in its own development of knowledge, and the teaching input is undervalued. The "tabula rasa" conceptions put the problem of readiness in the teacher's hand, whereas readiness in the predeterministic tradition depends on only the learner. A third position is introduced here which is labeled interactionist because it attempts to conceptualize the organism-environment interaction in less extreme polarities than the views previously discussed. Because of its different theoretical stance from "predeterministic" and "tabula rasa" approaches, the prescriptions on readiness to learn will be some- what different, and a different conception of knowledge acqui- sition will be advanced. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970 45</page><page sequence="8">V y gótsky' s Interactionist Approach . The presentation of Vygot- sky's (1965) theory of conceptual development here serves to illustrate an interactionist position in contrast to the predeter - ministic and tabula rasa approaches. Vygotsky's (1965) ap- proach toward the understanding of concept formation in- volves the distinction between "spontaneous" and "nonsponta- eous" concepts. Spontaneous concepts refer to those concepts of reality that are developed mainly through the child's own mental efforts (i.e., incidental experience). In operating with spontaneous concepts (e.g., house, dog, red, etc.), the child is not conscious of the concepts, because attention is centered on the object to which the concept refers but never on the act of thought itself. Spontaneous concepts are characteristic of the preoperational stage of development. Nonspontaneous concepts (or scientific concepts) are those which are acquired in school and are characterized by consciousness and deliberate control over the act of thought itself. Nonspontaneous concepts are characteristic of the operational stages of development. Vygotsky (1965) developed his "interactionist" position by asking two main questions concerning the development and interrelationship between the above mentioned concepts: What happens in the mind of the child to the scientific concepts he is taught in school? What is the relation- ship between the assimilating of information and the internal development of a scientific concept in the child's consciousness? (Vygotsky, 1965, p. 82). Vygotsky commences by criticizing two prevailing schools of thought, because of the way they treat the above mentioned concepts. The "tàbula rasa" position which is exemplified by associationist theorists (e.g., Thorndike) holds that scientific concepts have no inward history and are absorbed ready-made through a process of understanding and assimilation. Vygotsky maintains that this viewpoint fails to stand up under scrutiny, either theoretically or practically, since investigations of the pro- cess of concept formation reveal that a concept is more than the sum of its associative bonds formed by memory and mental habit, and is, rather, a complex act of thought that cannot be taught by drilling. Learning scientific concepts is accomplished only when the child's mental development has reached the requisite level. The development of concepts, or word meanings, pre- supposes the development of many intellectual func- tions: deliberate attention, logical memory, abstrac- tion, the ability to compare and differentiate, These complex psychological processes cannot be mastered through initial learning alone (Vygotsky, 1965, p. 83). Because instruction and development are treated as identi- cal, there is no question of the relationship between scientific and spontaneous concepts. Predeterministic approaches to concept formation, although recognizing the distinction between scientific and spontaneous concepts, are criticized because they fail to see the interaction between the two kinds of concepts in the course of the child's intellectual development. Spontaneous concepts, acquired through incidental experience (i.e., self-regulation), assume primary im- portance in Piaget's theorizing and are considered as the primary indicators of intellectual development. Vygotsky (1965) in commenting on this viewpoint, notes that the theory considers instruction and development to be independent. Development is seen as a process of maturation sub- ject to natural laws, and instruction as the utilization of the opportunities created by development. Typical of this school of thought are its attempts to separate with great care the products of development from those of instruction, supposedly to find them in their pure form (Vygotsky, 1965, p. 93). Vygotsky believes that the two processes (i.e., develop- ment of spontaneous and scientific concepts) are related and constantly influence each other. Because spontaneous concepts develop through the incidental experience of the child, while scientific concepts result from school instruction, it is felt that they must differ in their development as well as in their function- ing. However, these two variants of the process of concept formation must influence each other's evolution. The interrela- tion of scientific and spontaneous concepts is a special case within a much broader subject: the relation of school instruction to the mental development of the child. Vygotsky contends that the rudiments of systematization first enter the child's mind by way of his contacts with scientific concepts and are then trans- ferred to spontaneous concepts, changing their psychological structure from the top down. In Vygotsky's view, instruction precedes development and is partially influential in the develop- ment of more advanced spontaneous concepts. Vygotsky (1965) however, carefully distinguishes his position from the "tabula rasa" approaches already propounded: We found that intellectual development, far from fol- lowing Thorndike's atomistic mode, is not compart- mentalized according to topics of instruction. Its course is much more unitary, and the different school subjects interact in contributing to it. While the pro- cesses of instruction follow their own logical order, they awaken and direct a system of processes in the child's mind which is hidden from direct observation and subject to its own developmental laws (p. 192). Vygotsky obviously avoids the "tabula rasa" conception of the organism by postulating certain systems of thought that the child has which are somewhat independent of instruction yet are influenced by tuition. It seems that Piaget has uncovered many of the thought processes that Vygotsky claims are hidden from direct observation. From an interactionist's perspective it would be interesting to see how instruction affects these spon- taneous processes. As Vygotsky (1965) points out: Since instruction given in one area can transform and reorganize other areas of child thought, it may not only follow maturing or keep in step with but also precede it and further its progress (p. 96). Here I would like to cite one example, a study by Ojemann and Pritchett (1963), where Piagetian "stages" of development are used within Vygotsky's framework of development and in- struction. Within this context, Piagetian-based concepts have not been used as prescriptions of readiness to learn or profit from instruction, but rather as assessment procedures indicating the success of school instruction. Two factors differentiate this type of approach from the majority of studies quoted thus far in discussing the relevance for education of Piaget's work. First of all, the study does not use Piaget's theory to determine the structure and sequence of the curriculum. Second, these authors do not share Piaget's assumption that spontaneous concepts (intrinsic structure) can only be altered by the indirect inter- nalized activities of the child. In other words, they share Vygotsky's (1965) assumption that non-spontaneous school- learned (scientific) concepts can alter the child's spontaneous 46 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/ April, 1970</page><page sequence="9">concept formation. The study concerns the concept of "specific gravity" in kindergarten and first grade children. The assessment of children in the pre-test studiously avoided using Piagetian materials on "specific gravity" and this approach was main- tained in the "guided teaching" phase. Piaget's assessment of specific gravity was only given in the post-test; this guarded against the criticism that the children would be rotely parroting answers supplied by the teacher. After a pre-test, the children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental group had a three-session learning program designed to guide the child's perceptions to relevant aspects of the specific gravity concept. The "guided experiences" consisted of calling the child's attention to those aspects repre- sented by "weight of object" and "weight of an equivalent amount of water" while ignoring other aspects of the objects, such as shape, color, form, etc. The control group did not re- ceive these experiences. The results indicated that the experi- mental group made a significant gain over the control group on the post-test series and this gain was also evidenced in Piagetian assessments of specific gravity. One would like to have known the comparability of the Piaget tests with the other tests of specific gravity because Piagetian items were not utilized in the pre-test. Nevertheless, the study does give tentative evidence that Piaget's spontaneous concepts can be significantly altered by the non-spontaneous (scientific) concepts that are learned in school. This result, although contradictory to Piaget's assump- tion, is completely compatible with Vygotsky's interactionist position. The use of Piaget's assessment in the post-test indicates some generalization of the learning experience beyond the strict confines of the learning context. Readiness for a learning sequence is far less dogmatically presented in the Vygotskian framework. The organization of the material and the way it will be presented is partially dependent on the intuitions of the teacher. Vygotsky admits that different temporal sequences are possible in a learning task but he demands that the learning take into consideration the conceptual orienta- tion of the child where possible. This ambiguity makes any rigid concept of readiness impossible and forces the educator to ask relevant questions, aside from strictly the readiness issues, in deciding whether instruction is to be given now or at some later point in time. The crucial issues, in other words, are whether accelerated learning is reasonably economical in terms of the time and effort involved, and whether it helps children develop- mentally in terms of their total educational careers. The answer to these issues cannot be found within the confines of a psycho- logical theory of growth and development, for: Even if it be demonstrated that young children can learn this or that "advanced" process, we should still need to decide whether it is desirable and appropriate for them to do so. Sociologically, we may ask whether this is the best way for children to spend their time and energy. Intellectually, we may ask whether this is the most suitable preparation for future intellectual activities. Emotionally, we may ask whether "early" systematic instruction in reading, mathematics, or what have you, will have a harmful effect upon moti- vation, or upon personal and social behavior . . . The point we are trying to make here is simply this: Just the fact that children can learn this or that does not by itself mean that we, therefore, must require them to do so at some young age or in some early grade (Tyler, 1964, pp. 223-224). Postscript The treatment of "readiness" in this paper makes no pre- tense of being exhaustive. The historical focus was an attempt to give the reader a kind of perspective in which to view psy- chological theories and make understandable their frequent con- flicting prescriptions on readiness to learn in the curriculum. The focus of the paper ignored the possible treatment of readiness that is possible within the psychometric treatment of contem- poraneous individual differences. A brief and simple minded example will seem to illustrate the possibilities of this approach in the consideration of readiness. Let us assume that children are grouped on the basis of some personality measure (e.g., anxiety). If high-anxious and low-anxious children are separated, the question can be raised about the readiness of children to learn a subject under different kinds of instructional strategies. If it is found that high-anxious children appear to learn mathe- matics when the instructional strategy is highly structural but not when a "discovery" tactic is used, the concept of readiness can then be tied to differential instructional strategies which interact with individual differences found in children. This approach is rather promising, but the complexities involved make it a topic for another paper. References Adler, M. Some Implications of the Theories of Jean Piaget and J. S.
