The results of James Mellaart's work on this moderate-sized vil- lage near Burdur, Turkey introduced the scholarly world and the general public to the major cultural accomplishments of this region and range of time. Previous to Mella- art's excavations at Hacilar from 1957 to 1960, Anatolia was thought to be peripheral to the major post-pleistocene developments of the Near East involving the introduction of agriculture and the establishment of sedentary village life. The evidence un- covered at Hacilar, Mellaart's subsequent work at the larger site of Catal Hiiyiik, and the results of several other expeditions in Turkey have demonstrated that Anatolia was a major center of early village and town development which in many ways is un- equalled by any other locality. The basal levels of Hacilar revealed an aceramic farming community dating to about 6750 B.C. (Libby half-life) with fea- tures similar to contemporary developments in the Levant. At least seven building levels were recognized, some of them containing plastered and painted walls and floors. This occupation is followed by an hiatus of about 1000 years after which the site is reoccupied during "late neolithic" times (ca. 5700-5400 B.C.). The final building level of this period, Hacilar VI, was very well pre- served due to accidental burning. Con- sequently, the building plans and architec- tural details of several structures were re- covered as well as a great number of arti- facts. This occupation is characterized by well-baked burnished monochrome pottery, with a small proportion of painted vessels. Many sophisticated clay anthropomorphic figurines are found in this level. The upper occupation levels at Hacilar are referred to as "early chalcolithic" and date to about 5400 to 5000 B.C. The architectural and arti- factual yields are considerable and the quantity and quality of the painted pottery is of special importance. During the later part of this period the community seems to have been arranged into a fortress with a massive exterior wall. After about 5000 B.C. Hacilar was abandoned and never re- occupied. The three most important aspects of Mellaart's report, architecture, pottery, and figurines, are significant contributions to the growing corpus of knowledge about early village life in the Near East. Mellaart goes beyond description and claims that since artistic expression is a reflection of religious expression the richly decorated pieces reveal considerable data concerning early religious developments in this part of the world (Vol. I, pp. 99, 249). He suggests that the anthro- pomorphic figurines represent women in a variety of naturalistic positions and were used in the ritual practices of the com- munity. Whether one accepts this assertion or not, the artistic sensitivity and creativity displayed by the painted pottery and especially the naturalistic human figurines is a milestone in the history of art. In an analysis of Excavations at Hacilar it is necessary to evaluate Mellaart's work in the field as well as the report itself. From the perspective of modern anthropological archeology, there are many good as well as unsatisfactory aspects to his work. One of the most impressive qualities of Mellaart's research is his skill, or perhaps good fortune, in choosing productive sites for excavation. This is a result of his years of surveying in western and central Anatolia. Hacilar, and subsequently Patal Hiiyiik, provided an abundant yield of intact architecture and great quantities of aesthetically pleasing arti- facts. Another laudable characteristic of his work is the broad architectural exposures he made during excavation. These openings are relatively large compared to other prehis- toric sites in the Near East. This procedure has enabled the discovery of numerous building plans and the spatial relationships of buildings to each other. Despite two rather crude drawings (Vol. II, pp. 57, 70), the architectural plans are plentiful and of a high quality. The two volumes of Excava- tions at Hacilar are further highlighted by an abundance of excellent illustrations and photographs of the pottery and figurines found in the excavations. I find the most useful illustrations to be the pottery distribution maps by room of levels IIB and IA. These architectural drawings give the exact location of each painted pot found in situ, while vessels found in the fill are separated by rooms. These are accompanied by drawings of the shapes and designs of each vessel. With this type of detailed information it is possible for the reader to perform various kinds of stylis-</page><page sequence="3">948 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [74,1972 ] tic, locational analyses that Mellaart has not done himself. Another type of illustration particularly useful to the more inexperi- enced reader is the isometric reconstructions of various buildings and levels. These hypo- thetical representations are interesting in that they include building materials and activities which supposedly were performed in each area. In this way the reader is given a direct image of the functioning prehistoric community instead of solely the outlines of its foundations and features. These attempts at fleshing out the mate- rial remains illustrate one of the major shortcomings of Excavations at Hacilar and Mellaart's work in general. In my opinion, a scholarly report such as this is not the place for reconstructions and unequivocal inter- pretations which go well beyond what is merited by the data. Mellaart assigns func- tions to rooms such as workshops, kitchens, or shrines on the basis of little evidence. From fragmentary and somewhat ambiguous evidence he is willing to outline in detail the floor plan of a hypothetical second story (Vol. II, pp. 87-88). Continuing in this manner, Mellaart puts forth a "theoretical development plan of the village" for Hacilar VI that suggests what the entire village looked like based on the excavation of only a fraction of it. In this instance, the recon- struction is clearly labeled as "theoretical," but in other drawings the distinction be- tween data and extrapolation from data is not made (Vol. II, p. 74). This tendency to over-interpret and re- construct is not new to archeology. I readily acknowledge that data must be interpreted in order to facilitate description and com- munication. The researcher views evidence through a perspective of prior conceptions and definitions. As soon as one attempts to describe an entity in words, interpretation must be used. The real question is how far the researcher should go in attributing easily understandable meanings to objects and complexes that have been discovered. The researcher must consider the nature of his audience and the purpose of the report. Insofar as Excavations at Hacilar is avowedly the "definitive final report" one would expect it to be as objective and rigorous as possible. Interpretations should be kept to a minimum or carefully substantiated. Mellaart does neither. The debate over how much interpretation the researcher should cloak his material in goes back at least to the early 1900s and Sir Arthur Evans' reconstructions of the frescoes and buildings on the Minoan site of Knossos. Evans made Knossos an intelligible palace even to the uninitiated traveler, but has been frequently criticized by colleagues for the validity as well as necessity of his reconstructions. In a way, Mellaart has acted in a similar manner, this time making the reconstructions on paper instead of on the site itself. In both cases, it is easier for the non-expert to understand and appreciate the discoveries, but very difficult for the special- ist to separate fact from inference and come to his own conclusions about the site. The most fundamental shortcoming of Ex- cavations at Hacilar is that very little atten- tion is paid to developing a useable analytic- al approach or to substantiating various statements and theories. Despite its adequate length and plentiful illustrations, the lack of concern for scientific rigor diminishes the value of this site report. The logical structure of the natural sciences, which involves pro- posing and testing hypotheses, is gaining widespread acceptance in archeology (Wat- son, LeBlanc, and Redman 1971). Inter- pretations with minimal or no empirical support are insufficient, especially in a scholarly work of this sort. I suggest that there are three general approaches one can use in writing a site report: (1) presentation of the theory or hypothesis which was the focus of research, and data from the site to demonstrate whether or not it is confirmed; (2) a cultural historical description of the inhabitants' life- ways, including documentation for inter- pretations and other data which might be relevant to this description; (3) presentation of all of the recovered data in an objective usable manner together with conclusions and interpretations based on them. Mellaart has adopted the third approach, but has failed to present his data in a manner that can be used to substantiate many of his own conclusions or the theories of others. Only for levels IIB and IA does the reader know which pots and how many were found in each room. This kind of data would be useful in attempts at understanding the stylistic differences within the site and might yield inferences involving the social organization of the community. Even more serious than this is the almost total absence of any quantification of the data. In the few instances when numbers are given, such as the ratio of painted to plain</page><page sequence="4">ARCHEOLOGY 949 pottery (Vol. I, p. 100), it is not clear whether these figures were based on com- plete pots or on a count of potsherds. Statements like, "The quantity of Hacilar I pottery is enormous and was estimated at between 100,000 and 200,000 sherds" lead one to believe that not only were careful records not kept of sherd counts, but per- haps many of the potsherds themselves were not saved. In some instances, Mellaart did attempt to utilize analytical techniques, such as the seriation chart representing the proportion of the five basic decorative styles of pottery found in each level (Vol. I, p. 122). Un- fortunately, instead of counts or percentages of sherds or vessels on this chart, there are ordinal judgments such as, "nearly extinct, rare, less common, common, present, very common, most common, and more com- mon." With this format, it is impossible to judge the validity of the trends or to compare them with other variables. Even with a technique as useful as the pottery distribution maps, Mellaart does not include monochrome pots because they are "evenly distributed throughout the settlement of Hacilar IIA, IIB, and I, and as they con- tribute nothing to the diversity of taste and fashion they are omitted from the plans and tables" (Vol. I, p. 38). Superficial judgments such as this are used as a rationale for not including data or analyses. Another such case is the polished stone axes where, "varia- tions of shape are frequent, but they do not appear to have any chronological sign- ificance at Hacilar. Typological subdivision is therefore omitted as irrelevant" (Vol. I, p. 157). In criticizing omissions of this sort, it should be noted that order and chaos are not part of nature but part of the human mind, "that there is more order in the world than appears at first sight is not discovered till the order is looked for" (Hanson 1965:204). Archeologists have continually demonstrated that data once thought irrelevant can be quite productive when viewed through a proper perspective and with adequate methods. Mellaart's a priori decisions of what to analyze and present without explicit justification for his decisions is not a recom- mended procedure. Poorly documented interpretations and lack of concern for analytical procedures are tendencies which pervade much of arche- ology and anthropology today. Instead of careful substantiation, interpretive results of research are often put forth as a "plausible story." A reasonable account of what may have happened is given. Various facts may be cited occasionally, but little effort is ex- pended in attempting to confirm interpreta- tions with the data at hand. This leads to conclusions that are plausible, but it is dif- ficult to evaluate their reliability due to the lack of explicit substantiation. Much of what Mellaart concludes could be true, it is plausi- ble given the evidence he found, but it is insufficient for him to leave the analysis at that stage in a "definitive" report. If arche- ologists are to progress as scientists beyond the level of story tellers, then our interpreta- tions must be more than plausible, they must be compelling and rigorously demon- strated within a scientific framework. At several points in Excavations at Hacilar, Mellaart falls into this "plausible story" syndrome. One striking example is the suggested inspiration for the male (?) artisans in designing some of the clay female figurines. Spying through a cunningly contrived peep-hole in the wall he observes the older women of the village, naked and lithe in body but heavily breasted, nurses of society, or the old crone with coquet- tishly curly locks round her ageing face, her body bent with age. He watched the heavy form of a pregnant woman resting in the sweltering heat of noon, the young priestess, partly dressed in leopard skin, sporting with her young son, or the dignified grace of the long-robed woman dreaming, with her hand cupping her breasts" [Vol. I, p. 184]. Most of the recent archeological research on early villages in the Near East has focused on subsistence resources and the com- munity's relations to its biophysical sur- roundings. Clearly, in the work at Hacilar this type of ecological approach was secondary to a concern with the aesthetic sophistication of the prehistoric inhabitants. Despite a lack of concern during excava- tions, what had been saved of the faunal and floral remains were given to experts for study. Hans Helbaek's detailed treatise on the paleoethnobotany, "The Plant Husbandry of Hacilar," offers a refreshing contrast to the archeological sections of the report. In this lengthy chapter Helbaek gives a general discussion of the domestication and develop- ment of plants utilized in early villages of</page><page sequence="5">950 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [74,1972] the Near East. He describes in detail the fragmentary evidence from Hacilar, and then, drawing on his broad experience in this field, relates this evidence to the general questions of paleoethnobotany and early village subsistence. In this excellent chapter, Helbaek speaks both to the archeologist, uninformed in botanical matters, and to the specialist interested in incorporating these data into his own theories. Unfortunately, due to the lack of concern for subsistence data during the excavations, the quality of the evidence was not suf- ficient for many kinds of inferences. Hel- Baek was not brought into the project until the excavations were completed. Conse- quently, no effort was made to systematize the collection of seeds, and only obvious concentrations of seeds were preserved. The small number of samples and their poor condition prevented Helbaek from making definitive statements as to whether certain plants were already domesticated, especially in the aceramic levels. Future analytical work pursuing Helbaek's initial attempts at quantification of botanical remains might amplify his brief discussion of dietary re- quirements of the inhabitants and his infer- ences concerning the nature of plant com- munities in the fields of early domesticated cereals. The description by B. Westley of animal bones recovered falls far short of the high standards of the botanical section. The enumeration, by major occupation levels, of the species of the identifiable bones totals less than two hundred examples. Due to this small sample, few definitive statements about faunal resources and domestication are possible. Consequently, in Mellaart's brief discussions of subsistence in the arche- ological chapters he often is forced to suggest what the Hacilar people were eating on the basis of results from other, somewhat unrelated sites, instead of his own data (Vol. I, p. 9). The fact that so few animal bones were analyzed again brings into question the excavation techniques utilized and what pro- portion of the material was saved. Con- sidering the results of other excavations of Anatolian neolithic villages, one would expect a yield of identifiable animal bones in the thousands or tens of thousands. Not preserving animal bones from an important prehistoric village demonstrates a disregard for what have been widely accepted methods of excavations for many years. Another surprisingly small yield for this type of site is the small number of pieces of chipped stone, both flint and obsidian. From the total excavations only 667 pieces were analyzed. The most astounding figure is that from all of the aceramic levels, only eleven pieces of flint and obsidian were recovered. Since about 225 cubic meters of earth were moved, it suggests a yield of about one piece per twenty cubic meters of earth. In com- parison with other similar sites in Anatolia, this figure is fantastically low. The yield from reasonably contemporary levels of Qay6nii Tepesi (phases 4 and 5) were about fifty pieces found in each cubic meter of earth! Judging on the basis of the fragile clay features preserved in many of the rooms, one would expect that very careful excavating procedures had been utilized throughout. Contrary to this is the photo- graph (Plate IIIb) in which workmen in the background seem to be using big picks and shovels in a disorganized manner to excavate a portion of the aceramic levels. It is dif- ficult to evaluate an excavator's digging techniques from his site report, but the evidence here seems to imply a combination of high quality and unsatisfactory work- manship. One of the most fundamental questions Mellaart and his work at Hacilar (and sub- sequently at Qatal Hiiyiik) have raised in- volves the proper balance between popular- ization and rigorous documentation in re- porting archeological research. I recognize the desirability of communicating one's find- ings to the public, especially when the finds are so important and the expedition relies to some extent on the financial support of private foundations. The basic problem is that Mellaart has carried this popularization to the point of sensationalism and has not balanced it with thorough detailed analysis. Mellaart's zeal for the sensational is ex- plicitly stated in "it is always better to dig the larger and more spectacular site than a small village site" (Vol. I, p. 7)! He asserts this gives one a better perspective, but I would counter that archeology has suffered too long with this excessive concern for the spectacular at the cost of a well balanced, representative view of the total cultural system.</page><page sequence="6">ARCHEOLOGY 951 Reports about fertility goddesses, statuettes, aesthetic sophistication, and Hacilar as a religious and cult center have focused public and professional attention on this site, but not always for its own good. Mellaart mentions in his foreword that Hacilar has been the victim of "one of the most tragic chapters in the history of arche- ology" (Vol. I, p. vi). At the same time that the public learned of the aesthetic wonders of this prehistoric community, there ap- peared on the international antiquities market figurines and pottery reputed to be from Hacilar. Private collectors and major museums in Western Europe and America were quick to pay great sums of money for these smuggled antiquities. Turkey, like other nations who have been deprived of many of their great archeological treasures, usually does not allow antiquities out of the country. Hence, all the pieces that have appeared must have been illegally smuggled out. I am not suggesting that Mellaart played any part in this trafficking but the sensational claims he made in describing his finds helped to create a market for, and to authenticate, these pieces. His frequent references in this report to the "Hacilar Cemetery" and how many rich graves it contained would suggest to the layman that this flood of antiquities could be from these burials and are authentic. Mellaart goes so far as to suggest that this is the case (Vol. I, p. vi). Constant allusion to a cemetery is out of place in a scholarly work of this sort because there is no refer- ence to an attempt to locate or excavate it, or even any direct evidence that it actually exists. An international crisis was precipitated in 1969 and 1970 by the flood of alleged Hacilar antiquities plus several exhibitions of recently smuggled archeological treasures. The offended nations, especially Turkey, Greece, and Mexico, rightly demanded the governments of the recipient countries to outlaw their import. After a long period of delay, the United States and other countries have ratified the UNESCO agreement for- bidding the import of illegally procured antiquities. This long overdue ruling is slowly helping to slow the trade and to ease the reaction against foreign archeologists in the affected countries. An interesting footnote to this discussion of smuggled Hacilar artifacts is the result of a series of thermoluminescence tests on the pottery and clay figurines purchased by vari- ous museums and private collectors (Aitken, Moorey, and Ucko 1971). By observing the light emitted after the piece is reheated, the expert can determine approximately how long ago it was originally fired. The results were startling because the vast majority of the pieces smuggled out and considered authentic by many scholars proved to be manufactured quite recently. The high pro- portion of fakes attributed to the "Hacilar Cemetery" supports the notion that this cemetery might not exist. These forgeries have made prospective buyers very suspici- ous of any further pieces and may do more to stem the flow of antiquities from Hacilar than any government laws. There is little question that Hacilar and its inhabitants were one of the very impor- tant chapters in the broad sweep of the human career. James Mellaart has brought this to our attention in a lengthy and richly illustrated site report. From my perspective, as a professional archeologist, a more cauti- ous, rigorous, and better balanced report would have been more valuable. Excavations at Hacilar instills an enormous amount of respect for the prehistoric people that lived at Hacilar and their accomplishments. I am forced to have more mixed opinions about their excavator, Mr. Mellaart. Perhaps his own future as an Anatolian archeologist and the future of archeology in general would be a little brighter if careful reasoning had triumphed more frequently over sensational claims.
