Carden NASA-Langley Research Center Hampton, VA ABSTRACT This paper reviews selected analytical work in crash dynamics conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center. Three areas of research are included in the review and involve topics re- lated to general aviation (GA) aircraft, transport aircraft, and generic composite aircraft structural components. Analytical studies under the GA Crash Dynamics program using DYCAST are reviewed and include analysis of full scale aircraft sec- tions, concepts for energy absorbing structural subfloors for loads control, and related seat/occupant response analyses . A follow- on program in the transport air- plane category involved the air-to-ground crash test of a fully instrumented Boeing 720 airplane conducted by FAA/NASA and designated Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) . The analysis of drop tests of Boeing 707 transport sections in support of the CID test to qualify instrumenta- tion and provide data for later CID analysis are discussed. Analytical results from the analysis of the full scale 720 airplane crash are also included. Finally, ongoing and planned analysis ef- forts in the area of composite impact dynamics are covered. Crash- related loadings and response of generic composite structural com- ponents such as composite fuselage frames, composite subfloors, and composite fuselage cylindrical components are reviewed. BEGINNING IN 1972 AND SPANNING 10 YEARS, NASA Langley Research Center conducted crash dynamics research on general aviation aircraft. As illustrated in figure 1, the program involved not only full-scale tests of airplane structures but also energy absorbing seats, seat/occupant response and modeling, energy absorbing airplane structures, and nonlinear structural analysis (including the development of analysis tools). During the time of the NASA/FAA Crash Dynamics Program a major element of the effort was the development of analytical tools for the large displacement, nonlinear analysis of Fig. 1 Crash dynamics research of general aviation aircraft. structures subjected to crash loadings. Three nonlinear structural analysis computer programs of interest to NASA Langley were KRASH, ACTION, and DYCAST. KRASH is a hybrid program; both ACTION and DYCAST are analytical finite element formulations. All three programs have the capability to predict both nonlinear material and geometric behavior, include inertial ef- fects, and use finite -difference time integration. This paper focuses on the DYCAST computer program and reviews several analyses conducted by NASA Langley Research Center using DYCAST. The analyses illustrate the range of structures to which the program has been applied. The structures involved general aviation category structures, transport category structures, and typical generic structures of advanced composite materials. For details of KRASH and ACTION, the reader is directed to (1)* , (2) , and(3) , and (4), respectively whereas (4) , (5) , and (6) should be consulted for details on the DYCAST program. * Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. 4.279 0096-736X/87/9504-0279$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL AVIATION AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES As part of the crash dynamics program effort to understand the dynamic response of general aviation airplane structures and to assess loads and damage experienced by such structures in crash situations, an aircraft fuselage section was tested under vertical impact conditions typical of a crash situation often associated with a takeoff or landing accident. The DYCAST computer program was used to predict section responses for comparison with experimental data (See (7)). AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE SECTION. -The fuselage sec- tion of a twin- engine, low-wing airplane that was analyzed using DYCAST is shown in figure 2 prior to the drop testing of the specimen. The section was loaded with two anthropomorphic dummies in standard aircraft seats. Total weight of the fuselage section including the two 74.8 kg (165 lb) dummies was 247 kg (545 lbs) . The impact conditions of the test were: Vertical velocity = 8.38 m/s (27.5 fps) . Pitch angle = 0.75 deg pitch-up Yaw angle = 0 deg. Roll angle = 0 deg. The insert in figure 2 shows locations of accelerometers at the inboard and outboard seat rail positions where decelerations were recorded during the impact event. Only half of the airplane section was modeled to take advantage of the symmetric im- pact conditions in roll and yaw. The DYCAST model of the structure, the seat and occupant is shown in an exploded schematic in figure 3. The side wall representation was beam elements for the fuselage frames, upper and lower window elements ; axial rods for the longerons ; and membrane elements represented the skin. The floor frames and longitudinal floor beams were modeled as beam elements for the upper and lower flanges with membrane elements for the webs. The seat and rails were beam elements and four ver- tical nonlinear springs simulated the cushions, pan and a portion of the seat. The occupant was one mass linked to the four springs. The skin and floor panels were membrane elements. A breakdown of the various details of the DYCAST Substructure model included: Degrees of freedom 493 Number of nodes 200 Number of elements 432 Number of stringers 36 Number of beams 130 Number of membranes 262 Number of springs 4 Lumped masses 1 This model is a relatively detailed ideal- ization of the airplane section involving high degrees of freedom and a large number of elements . As indicated later such a model often may not be necessary. Comparisons of the analytical results from DYCAST and experimental accelerations of the Fig. 2 Impact test of an aircraft fuselage section.

The structural response histories in figure 4 are for the fuselage frame adjacent to the front and rear seat legs, respectively. The experimental data have been filtered to 100 Hz whereas the DYCAST predictions exhibit high fre- quency oscillations on the basic response. The high frequency responses are typical because of the high refinement in the model. The smoother experimental accelerations appear to fair the analytical responses and thus are considered to be in good agreement both in magnitude and general response shape . The measured response of the dummy pelvis region shows a double peak (this is typical of other test results also) of approximately 50 g's and 40 g's, respectively. However, the DYCAST predictions show only one peak that basically fairs through the two experimental peaks. Since the analytical occupant model was simply one mass on springs, this result is not surprising. Inclusion of a good numerical filtering technique would be extremely useful for removing the high frequency behavior exhibited in the DYCAST numerical results . Removal of the higher frequencies (generally local structural re- sponses) would aid in establishing better experimental/analytical correlation and assess- ing the accuracy of the analysis. ENERGY ABSORBING SUB FLOORS . -As previously mentioned, part of the NASA crash dynamics program involved structural concepts to at- tenuate the loads transmitted to the occupant by the structure either by modifying structural as- sembly, changing geometry of its elements, or adding specific energy absorbing devices to help dissipate the kinetic energy. A combined ex- perimental and analytical study of the response to crash loads of energy absorbing subfloor con- cepts was conducted. The design approach of the subfloor s is shown in figure 5. The idea was basically to re- place existing subfloor structure (where possible) with a design that consists of two parts , an upper floor zone and a lower crushable support zone. The upper floor, common to all the subfloor concepts, would be a strong shallow platform designed to carry loads and moments im- posed by the seat/occupant and to maintain seat to structure integrity. The lower zone or crushable floor support was designed to collapse in a controlled manner and to distribute loads as uniformly as possible to the upper structure. Five concepts were chosen and detailed descrip- tions and data on the various energy absorbing floor concepts are given in (8) and (9) .

Accelerations were measured on the seat rails and at the center- of- gravity of the loading platforms (about pelvis elevation) . Vertical im- pact velocity was 7.3 m/s (24 fps) for the tests . The DYCAST computer program was also used to predict responses of the subfloors for compar- ison with experimental results. Figure 7 il- lustrates the finite element idealization used for one of the subfloor concepts (corrugated beam) . As was the case with the airplane fuselage section model, only half the structure was idealized taking advantage of symmetry of tests conditions. For the subfloor studies, the DYCAST program was used in a simplified and more economical manner to model the complex nonlinear response of the aircraft subfloor sections to crash loads . The crush zone of the subfloors was characterized with five nonlinear springs placed at the floor beam- frame intersections. The com- bination of the springs followed the static load- deflection behavior determined during the static test phase of the study. The stiff eners of the floor platform and the seat rails were modeled with beams , the floor skin was modeled with triangular membranes, and the rigid seat (load platform) and lead mass was a lumped mass constrained to the four seat attachment points. The half model in DYCAST consisted of the following: Beam elements 40 Membrane elements 24 Nonlinear springs 5 Nodes 34 Degrees of freedom 39 (for half model) Typical dynamic responses and the analytical predictions are compared in figure 8. The capability of DYCAST to analyze accurately the energy absorbing subfloors is indicated by the comparisons in figure 8 .

However, some differences in the predicted and the experimental results are evident in figure 8(b) for the notched corners subfloor wherein the static and the dynamic behavior of the load- crush data were found to be different at the larger crush values . The initial experimental and analytical peak value of the response is in good agreement but the DYCAST prediction becomes lower and consequently extended over a longer time than the experimental deceleration pulse. The behavior of the two illustrations are typi- cal behavior of the concepts studied. The DYCAST analysis of the energy absorbing subfloor concepts and the correlation with the experimental results have shown that static 4.282</page><page sequence="5">860819 structural crush data can be useful in dynamic analysis; however, the results also indicate that the analyst must exercise care and have confidence that the static deformation behavior approximates the dynamic deformation behavior to achieve realistic simulation of crash behavior. SEAT/OCCUPANT RESPONSES. -A primary objective of the NASA crash dynamics research was to determine the response of seats in the crash en- vironment and access the loads experienced by the occupants (dummies). Research was, there- fore, also conducted on seat concepts that could possibly reduce the loads below those ex- perienced in standard aircraft seats. Companion analysis of the seats was also part of the over- all crash dynamics efforts (See (10)). Multiple -degree -of- freedom seat/occupant/ restraint systems that exist in aircraft can produce dynamic amplification factors that sig- nificantly increase occupant -experienced loads if the seats are relatively stiff with high fun- damental frequencies. Energy -absorbing seat concepts were developed that help reduce the loads transmitted from the airframe to the occupant. Dynamic tests of the seats were drop tests in which a floor mounted energy absorbing seat was used. The tests were conducted to ob- tain definitive photographic and instrument data from the seat and occupant (dummy) during an im- pact situation. The stopping deceleration in the drop test was a typical triangular pulse from the NASA full-scale crash program. Fig. 9 Seat test apparatus and seat/occupant . Figure 9 shows the test apparatus and seat/occupant at the test drop height and near the impact surface. The test apparatus was a 1.8 m (6 ft) diameter by 1.2 m (4 ft) long steel cylinder. A steel rim with various holes around the circumference provided a means of lifting and positioning the impact attitude (pitch adjustment) . A wooden wedge arrangement separated from the bottom cylinder mounting sur- face by honeycomb blocks (load limiters) helped shape the impact pulse upon entering a container filled with small glass beads. The seat was mounted on the inside of the cylinder on a plat- form covered with plywood to attenuate high frequency responses of the apparatus . Fig. 10 Floor mounted energy absorbing seat. The energy absorbing seat shown in figure 10 is composed of two parallel four-bar linkages. The floor serves as the fixed bar, the seat pan is the top bar, and the front and rear legs are the other two bar links. Wire bending energy ab- sorbers are attached diagonally between the seat pan rear legs and the front floor leg joints. A 50 percentile, hybrid II part 572 anthropomor- phic dummy was seated and restrained to the seat with a four point shoulder harness and lap belt arrangement. Accelerometers in the dummy, on the seat and on the floor measured deceleration responses . Two relatively severe tests of the seat were conducted at an impact velocity of 12.8 m/s (42 fps) , one at 0 degrees (floor parallel to the ground, and a second test with the floor in- clined down 30 degrees. Data from only the 0 degree pitch test are included herein and figure 11 presents the experimental results. Vertical accelerations measured on the floor, on the seat pan, and in the dummy's chest are shown along with before and after photographs of the seat/occupant in the test apparatus. Both fil- tered (20 Hz) and unfiltered data are shown. The 37 G, 0.07 second duration acceleration pulse on the floor closely simulate one of the NASA crash test normal acceleration pulses. The energy ab- sorbing seat effectively attenuated the pulse down to between 15 to 17 G's with a total dura- tion of about 0.10 seconds. Although a spike acceleration of 35 G's was measured in the dummy's chest, the average acceleration was about 15 G's. A overlay of the floor and seat pulses clearly illustrates the reduction of the load transmitted to the seat pan (See figure 11). In earlier work, a computer program called MSOMLA (Modified Seat Occupant Model for Light Aircraft) had been used to model occupant re- sponses in a simplified one dimensional spring representation of an aircraft seat. However, to obtain a more sophisticated seat model for the 4.283</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 11 Response of energy absorbing seat for 0 degree pitch drop test.

Figure 12 shows the DYCAST seat/occupant model. The model was by necessity a hybrid model consisting of finite elements and axial force stringers (nonlinear springs in tabular form). In the model, the wire bender energy absorber, shoulder harness, lap belt, seat back stiffness, and pelvis stiffness are modeled as nonlinear springs. The occupant was three masses connected by pin jointed beams. The pelvis mass follows a node which is multi- point constrained to move along the seat pan. The seat was modeled with beams with the seat mass distributed to the nodes. A time dependent stopping force was applied to node 1 (representing the mass of the test apparatus) and was a good approximation of the 36.5 G, .076 second deceleration pulse of the test apparatus and of NASA crash test. The seat and occupant were given an initial vertical velocity of 12.8 m/s (42 fps) . Comparisons of the DYCAST model results and the experimental data are presented in figure 13 along with three computer graphics plots of the seat and occupant positions at times 0.0, 0.05, and 0.10 seconds. At time = 0.05 seconds the seat back is compressed and the harness and seat belt are slack. Experimentally the dummy re- bounded and loaded the belts at 0.14 seconds. ^ SHOULDER HARNESS SEAT BACK-'' ' ''' V' ' SPRING V' V^. - CG ''' '' ' LAP BELT S SPRING ' V' ' ' ' 77 77 T - 0.0 s T • 0.05 s T - 0.10 s NORMAL LONGITUDINAL SEAT PAN SEAT 2b " ExpŁR[WEHTAi 25 - ^^G^t^-^PERIMEHTAL ACCEL, G fi - * ACCEL, G 0 -25 1 1 1 ' -25 •- 1 1 ' 0 .OA .08 .12 ,16 0 ,0A .08 .12 .lb TIME, s TIME, s i0 I" CHEST CHEST ACCEL, G í5 25 0 - ACCEL, G 0 ^ - ■ ¿ -25 1 ' ' 1 -25 ' V^-^C . ■ 0 .OA .08 ,12 .16 0 ,0A .08 .12 .16 TIME, s Tilt, s Fig. 13 Experimental and DYCAST analytical seat/occupant results.

TRANSPORT CRASH PROGRAM Following the conclusion of the General Aviation Crash Dynamics Program, there was a shift of emphasis to impact dynamics of transport -category aircraft. The FAA and NASA obtained a Boeing 720 airplane for a remotely piloted air-to-ground controlled- impact demonstration (CID) . As illustrated in figure 14, the CID actually served as a transition ef- fort as research was formulated to move more heavily into the response characteristics of generic composite structural components under crash type loadings which is discussed later. 4.284</page><page sequence="7">860819 TRANSPORT SECTION ANALYSIS. -As part of preparation for the CID, a series of three transport fuselage section drop tests were per- formed at the Impact Dynamics Research Facility ((11) and (12)). The purposes of the drop tests were to provide structural crush data for non- linear spring representations of the subfloor in a finite element model to be used to predict the global crash behavior of the 720 aircraft test; to qualify the data acquisition and photographic systems built by Langley Research Center for the Controlled Impact Demonstration; and to generate structural response data for comparison with DYCAST computer predictions . Fig. 15 Transport fuselage section in drop test apparatus . The fuselage sections were Boeing 707 air- craft fuselages which are nearly structurally identical to the 720, another of which was not available for test purposes. Figure 15 shows the forward fuselage section suspended in the Vertical Test Apparatus of the Impact Dynamics Research Facility. This 12 -foot- long fuselage section, representative of modern, all-metal aircraft fuselage construction, weighed 2296 kg (5051 lbm) including seats, dummies, and instrumentation. Seats were located on the test section approximately as anticipated on the CID test. Eight 50th percentile, 165 lb, Part 572 anthropomorphic dummies and one uninstrumented 95th percentile dummy were seated and restrained among the five triple seats in the section. Ballast was added to the other six occupant locations to load the seats. As shown in figure 15, the transport section was suspended by a series of cables with turnbuckles to allow ad- justment to control the impact attitude. The vertical impact velocity was 20 fps at 0 degree pitch, yaw, and roll. The impact surface was a massive concrete pad beneath the Vertical Test Apparatus . Although several different analytical models with varying degrees of sophistication were for- mulated (13) , this paper discusses only the model designated as the two-frame DYCAST Model. ^EA^ ' .-NONLINEAR SPRING ' ' / rW ALL "FLOOR ' - ' /'/ INTERSECT,0N ' ' A*/ C"SECTI°N V-ļ' / Y BEAM elements ' ' y'X STRINGER ELEMENT GROUND CONTACT ť" SPRINGS ' I Fig. 16 DYCAST two -frame model of transport section. This model was constructed in sufficient detail to model the floor, two seats with lumped mass occupants, and the fuselage structure without using nonlinear springs for part of the structure. Although symmetry was lacking for the full section, two forward frames had two seats symmetrically located. Thus a half model was used for computations on the section. For completeness the full two -frame model is shown schematically in figure 16. Beam elements with appropriate cross -section shape were used to model the frames below the floor as well as the floor and seat rails. Since the upper fuselage was not expected to experience plastic deformations, less details were used in modeling that part of the section. Four lumped masses connected by horizontal stringer supported by 4 nonlinear springs representing the vertical legs were used for the triple seat occupants. Exper- imental force -deflection data for the seat legs was used. Because of asymmetry in the seat pan loadings the occupant mass was distributed 2 to 1 over the inboard and outboard legs , respectively. The symmetric half model consisted of: Degrees-of-freedom 105 Beams 32 Stringers 4 Lumped masses 16 Ground springs 6 Seat springs 4 Nonlinear material properties for the sub- floor aluminum frames (beam elements) were elastic-plastic with a small amount of linear strain hardening. Comparisons between the transport section structural behavior/responses and the DYCAST predictions are presented in figure 17 along with both experimental and analytical decel- erations at the floor/fuselage intersection. As shown in figure 17, gross structural damage was confined to the fuselage below the floor level. 4.285</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 17 Experimental and DYCAST analytical responses of transport fuselage section. All seven frames ruptured near the bottom con- tact, and plastic hinges formed in each frame along both sides of the fuselage (approximately 45 deg. from the contact point). Total upward crush was about 22-23 inches at the forward end to 18-19 inches at the rear, whereas the two- frame model predicted 22 inches of crush. The measured and computed decelerations are also in good agreement for the floor/fuselage location wherein both show two peaks in the response. The first occurred shortly after contact and was relieved when the frames ruptured. The second peak in the response occurred when the frame hinge points contacted the concrete pad. Transport fuselage section drop tests provided useful data about the crash behavior of metal aircraft in support of the full-scale Boeing airplane Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID). Although DYCAST full-section models using only finite elements for the representation were formulated (See (13)), the DYCAST two-frame model provided excellent correlation with ex- periemental crash behavior of the fuselage structure with a minimum of empirical force deflection data representing structure in the analytical model. On December 1, 1984, NASA and the FAA con- ducted a full-scale air- to- surface impact- survivable Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) . The principal purposes of the impact test were to test antimisting additive for fire- ball prevention in crashes and demonstrate fuel/propulsion system operation (Primary FAA interest) to acquire metal structural data to bet- ter understand transport crash behavior (Primary NASA interest) . CID CRASH ANALYSIS . -This section describes the CID crash scenario, the DYCAST hybrid finite element model, and the comparison of typical ex- perimental and analytical results for the CID crash (14). The Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) was the culmination of four years of ef- fort by the NASA and the FAA. • Gross weight: 175-195,000 pounds • Sink rate: 17 FPS .

The planned scenario of the CID (See figure 18) was to have a 3.3 to 4 degree flight path in a 1 degree nose -up attitude. The vertical and horizontal velocities were to be 17 fps and ap- proximately 150 knots, respectively. Impact was intended to be symmetric. After the primary im- pact, the aircraft was to slide into wing cutters to open the wing tanks for the FAA an- timisting fuel experiments. In the approach to the impact site, the airplane was slightly off track and attempts to correct lead to a left wing down impact (13 degrees roll and and 13 de- grees yaw with essentially zero pitch) . CG vertical velocity was about 17 fps. From analysis of acceleration traces it was estimated that the CG velocity was reduced to about 12 fps at nose impact time with an angular pitch rate of approximately -6 degrees per second. Although the impact was asymmetric , the roll and yaw were ignored and initial conditions of 12 fps CG ver- tical velocity, -0.1 rad/s pitch rate, and initial pitch angle of -3 degrees at time of fuselage contact were input to the symmetric DYCAST model.

External forces applied to the model were gravity, friction, time dependent lift, and wing crush force. The DYCAST model is of an aircraft that is 130 feet long with a wing span of 130 feet. Detailed models for the complete aircraft such as used in the section analyses would effect- ively be impossible because of the number of de- grees of freedom that would result from such an attempt. As indicated in figure 19 and shown in more detail in figure 20, the CID was modeled using a combination of single and compound beams along with nonlinear crush springs (determined from previous analysis and/or tests) for the un- derstructure . The compound beam was used to model the cross -sectional properties of the skin- stringer- frame structure of the airplane fuselage. The combination of the various beams representing segments of the fuselage is con- strained and the moments of inertia are maintained at the proper vertical cross -section location in the fusleage. Figure 21 presents a comparison of typical experimental and analytical deceleration results for the CID impact. The correlation of the DYCAST model predictions with the experimental structural decelerations for three cabin loca- tions, pilot station, body station 540, and body station 820 (See sketch at top of figure) are considered to be quite good in both magnitude and the duration of the decelerations at the three locations shown. Reports are in preparation to present all structural data during the primary impact of the CID airplane and a full, asymmetric DYCAST model being developed will allow parametric studies of the effect of pertinent impact parameters on the response and structural behavior under different scenarios of interest. Based upon the good cor- relations already found for the various DYCAST models, it is believed that using the various strategies , such as hybrid models combining both spring-mass representations and empirical and/or experimental data for s true- turai description, will continue to provide realistic crash be- havior prediction.

COMPOSITE CRASH DYNAMICS If one considers a typical aircraft fuselage, whether metal or composite, components such as curved and flat panels , curved and straight beams (frames and stringers) as well as cylindrical sections (subfloors) on a larger scale are apparent as parts of the aircraft. In a crash situation these structures may expe- rience loading conditions which could cause failure and create hazards for the occupants of the aircraft. A research program has been formu- lated to address the global response and behavior of basic generic composite structural components subjected to typical crash loadings. As mentioned briefly in an earlier section, emphasis has moved to the area of composite structures and their behavior under crash re- lated loadings.

Fig. 23 Composite frame test specimen. COMPOSITE FUSELAGE FRAMES. -In a fuselage one particularly common component is the frames . Consequently, studies are underway of the response/failure behavior of composite curved fuselage frames subjected to impact loadings. Both experimental and analytical efforts are included. As shown in figure 23, the composite frames are 1.83 m (6 foot) diameter Z-cross-section shaped components. The main web is 7.62 cm (3 in) in depth with 2.95 cm (1.16 in) flanges. The frames were fabricated from 280 5 -harness/3502 composite material which is a drapeable fabric composite. The thickness of the component is .20 cm (0.08 in) with a (45/0/135/90) s layup. The frame was fabricated from four 90 degree seg- ments joined with a splice plate on each side of the joints. The composite frames were drop tested at 7.8 m/s (25.5 fps) in the drop tower apparatus shown in figure 24. The guide rails, back board, and plexiglas front maintained the frame inplane for the impact onto the concrete surface. Strain gages distributed around the circumference measured the dynamic strains whereas accel- erometers on the 5.0 kg (11 lbm) masses at the horizontal diameter, and on the top and bottom of the frame measured decelerations . A beam was attached across the horizontal diameter to con- straint motion laterally. High speed motion pictures were taken of the frames during the im- pact sequence . Fig. 24 Experimental apparatus for composite frame tests. A DYCAST analysis was also conducted of the impact of the frame. The DYCAST model utilized the Z -beam element of the program. Each beam (with the exception of splice plate areas) was a 2.5 degree beam segment. One half of the frame was modelled to take advantage of symmetry. The half frame model had 74 beam finite elements. Appropriate analytical constraints were applied to maintain inplane motions similar to the experiment. Since the DYCAST program was dev- loped primarily to analyze metal structures, the laminate properties were used in the beam model of the frame. A maximum strain- to -failure criteria, available in the program, was used to specify when failure occurred. The DYCAST capa- bility of accounting for partial failures of elements by monitering the specified failure strain magnitude at Gaussian integration points in the beam cross section was used. Typical experimental and analytical results for the composite frames are presented in figure 25. Figure 25(a) shows the deceleration of the ballast mass at the end of the cross beam. Both the raw and filtered (60 Hz filter frequency) are included. The magnitude of the deceleration was approximately 60 g's with a pulse duration 4.288</page><page sequence="11">860819 Fig. 25 Typical experimental and analytical results for composite frame. (a) Ballast mass deceleration. (b) Circumferential strain distribution. of 40 milliseconds. Figure 25(b) presents the circumferential strain distribution at failure. The distribution is shown from -180 degrees (top of frame) counterclockwise through 0 degrees (the impact point at the bottom of the frame) to 180 degrees (top of frame) . In the experiment and analysis the splice plates were at the point of impact. Around the circumference of the frame, there is a variation of strain between compression and tension with the maximum com- pressive strain occurring at a point about 15 degrees outside the point of impact. A compar- ison of DYCAST strains and the measured strains agree in the general shape of the distribution ;however, the experimental strains near the splice plate are lower than the analytical strains. Also, the peak strains are at about 15 degrees in the experiment but are around 7 to 10 degrees in the analytical results . A larger num- ber of beam elements in this region of the frame might inprove the correlation. Beyond 22.5 de- grees the predicted and experimental strains are in fairly good agreement. Typical damage to the composite frame is shown in figure 26 and the photographs also in- dicate the repeatability of the location and the type of damage incurred in the tests. As may be seen in figure 26 , the type of failure is a com- plete fracture across the frame section within approximately 15 degrees of the impact point. Failure initiated in the outer flange and progressed across the web through the inner flange. Complete fracture is not the type of failure behavior desired since structural inter- gi ty can be important in a crash situation of an Fig. 26 Photograph of impact damage to composite frames. aircraft. Ductile -like behavior such as noted in the transport section drop tests is more desire- able since structural integrity was maintained despite the large plastic defor- mations of the under -floor structure. The first failure predicted with DYCAST using 6400 micros train as the failure strain value in the beam elements was outside the bot- tom splice plates at about 15 degrees from the impact point. This area corresponds to the region where the frame failed in the experi- ments. It is felt that from a global stand- point the DYCAST program seems to predict well the location that failures should be expected in the composite frames wherein only the laminate, not a ply-by-ply, property has been used for the properties of the structure. Additional consid- eration will be given to assessing whether rea- sonably accurate prediction of global failure/ behavior of composite structural components can be obtained using only laminate properties. It would be highly desireable to be able to utilize such an approach for predicting global failure/response of composite structures under impact loading conditions. Since the testing and analysis of the composite frames is currently underway, additional correlations between the experimental data and DYCAST predictions will be examined. Progression from the individual frames to the more complex subfloor arrangement is the ap- proach outlined in the chart of figure 22 discussed previously and represents the sys- tematic building block method of the efforts in the generic composites program. COMPOSITE SUBFLOORS . -Once tests and analysis are completed for the composite frames, the next step involves testing and analysis of composite subfloors such as shown in figure 27. The sub- floor is constructed from the same Z- cross sec- tion frames as the individual frames just discussed. Pultruded J -stringers are used to join three of the composite frames (50.8 cm (20 in.) on center) into the subfloor as shown and metal beams to be representative of the floor 4.289</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 27 Photograph of composite subfloor section. beams tie the top of the frames together across the diameter of the section. Composite skin with (45/ -45/0/ -45/45/90) s layup (not shown) is bonded and fastened to the frames and stringers. An expanded DYCAST model will be configured to analyze the subfloor for correlation/comparison with the experimental responses. It is likely that additional upgrading of the capabilities of DYCAST will be necessary to improve and/or provide a viable composite material analysis capability. The progressive or partial failure modification that was added to the DYCAST code is one simple type of require- ment among others that will enhance the analysis potential of the program. In addition to the work that has been con- ducted in the Impact Dynamics Branch at NASA Langley Research Center, other more fundamental research with much broader implications is underway. The following section discusses re- search to develop analysis capabilities which crosses many disciplines that have requirements for analysis capability beyond todays codes. COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL MECHANICS Recently, a major research program entitled "COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL MECHANICS" (CSM) was initiated at the NASA Langley Research Center. This section by necessity is a very brief intro- duct ion to COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL MECHANICS activities and the reader is referred to (15) for greater details on the subject. Basically, this new undertaking is focusing on problem areas and analysis needs relative to commercial/military transport aircraft, advanced aerospace vehicles, and large space structures. It becomes apparent that there are a number of analysis needs in these disciplines. Figure 28 lists several major needs. Analytical formula tions refers to basic theories in structural analysis, such as new approaches to define non- linear and transient problems and new finite element representations. Computational tech- niques refer to the solution strategies used to • Major improvements needed in: • Analytical formulations • Computational techniques • Modeling • Error analysis • User Interface • Software that incorporates above improvements • Account for major advances in computer hardware • Multiprocessor computers Fig. 28 Structural analysis needs. solve the structural analysis problems. Whereas most linear and static problems can be solved using almost any modern solution strategy, suc- cess in solving most nonlinear or transient structural analysis problems requires robust computational procedures and trained, qualified analysts . The last three technologies shown in the figure modeling, error analysis, and user interface are related. These areas deal with rapid and reliable definition of the math model of the analysis problem and interpretation of results. The analyst needs to define the analysis problem and prescribe the desired ac- curacy of the results. Error analysis along with other logic should automatically choose the finite element or finite difference grid size to give the needed accuracy. The improvements discussed above need to be incorporated into structural analysis software, and the software should account for advancements in computer harware such as array processors, supercomputers, and computers with parallel/con- current processing. Thus, the overall objective of the CSM ac- tivities is to develop the computational struc- tural mechanics technology needed to analyze the complex aircraft and space structures of the 1990' s . The makeup of the CSM activities are depicted in figure 29. The upper center of the figure shows a Cyber 200 -class supercomputer similar to the VPS -32 at Langley Research Center. Computational efficiency on these machines depends dramatically upon the algorithm used and its implementation. A standard generic test bed is depicted in the lower center of the figure. Expanding level of capabilities and specializations emanate from a core containing the computer hardware and the operating system through an executive system that contains engineering support utilities and periphery containing application modules. The test bed will serve as a vehicle to transfer proven analytical methods and computational al- gorithms to industry. 4.290</page><page sequence="13">860819 Fig. 29 COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL MECHANICS (CSM) program. Several practical application targets are being used in the CSM activities. For example, in the lower left of figure 29 is a target in- volving the development of a capability to conduct local detailed 3-D stress analysis within a larger 2-D analysis model. On the right portion is illustrated the desired capability to calculate the transient dynamic response of mulitbody space structures being considered along with other potential target applications. Software to address the target problems will be developed and will be available to researchers for subsequent use. During the first years of CSM activities, the methods research will be focused on applied structural mechanics research to insure that analysis methods with high potential for solving critical application problems and for removing analysis deficiencies are identified. The new CSM research should provide an opportunity to conduct advanced analysis research that exploits new and future hardware developments and will serve as a foundation for the next generation structural analysis system. CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper has briefly reviewed analytical and accompanying experimental research on crash dynamics conducted at the Langley Research Center. The review involved work in general aviation aircraft structures, transport category aircraft, and generic composite structural components . Focus of the analytical efforts were on the finite element computer program called DYCAST (Dynamic Crash Analysis of STruc tures) . The diversity of aerospace structures to which the computer program has been applied has been il- lustrated by examples for which experimental data are available. Early work with structures related to general aviation illustrated the ap- proach of using very detailed finite element models whereas other studies made use of hybrid analysis techniques. In these analyses either experimental data and/or analytical data from detailed analysis of typical structure was used to simplify the modeling of larger structures. This approach helped to limit the complexity of the structural model and reduce the required de- grees of freedom of the problem. Progression of research from the general aviation arena to transport airplane structures relied heavily on the experience and data base of the earlier GA crash dynamics program. The modeling strategies used to analyze the larger transport structures including a full size Boeing-720 Controlled Impact Demonstration, il- lustrate not only the state-of-the-art in large displacement, nonlinear crash dynamics but also emphasize the need for new analysis techniques and capabilities. Ongoing experiments and analysis in the area of generic composite structural components served to highlight a need for local/global analysis capabilities which have a mulit- level or "zoom- in" feature, that is, overall re- sponses, loads, displacements, and rotations would be applied to local, highly detailed model regions of the same structure. A new research effort recently initiated at the NASA Langley Research Center called COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL MECHANICS (CSM) was briefly discussed. This research effort has as its goal the development of computational struc- tural mechanics technology needed to analyze the complex aircraft and space structures of the 1990 ' s . A common thread that has run through all analytical/ experimental examples of this paper has been the need for ingenuity often required on the part of the analyst in using the analyti- cal tools available to solve structural problems wherein a direct modeling approach is not feasible or necessarily desireable. Such is of- ten a necessity with many if not all analysis tools as new and challenging problems are encountered. Likely it is to be even with the newer analysis technology that hopefully will result from the CSM activities. REFERENCES 1. G. Wittlin and M. A.
