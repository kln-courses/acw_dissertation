<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSIOLOGY AND THE MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY IN MID-SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND THEODORE M. BROWN Introduction In 1901 the famous Cambridge physiologist Michael Foster ventured beyond his discipline and published ten Lectures on the History of Physiol- ogy in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.1 Lively and informative, Foster's Lectures soon became a major reference work for students of the history of physiology. Scholarly articles, general books, and collections of source materials all took Foster as an authority and guide.2 Few seemed to notice, or if they noticed none seemed to care, that Foster wrote history as a good scientist would. He selected problems of greatest interest to his own generation, awarded credit or accorded blame to pred- ecessors for their "correct" or "incorrect" ideas and techniques, and, generally, saw physiologists in the period he studied as searching for what he identified as "right method" and "distinctly physiological questions."3 Thus, Foster considered Vesalius deficient for being too strictly "anatomi- cal," while Descartes, like Herbert Spencer of his own time, failed by aiming at the creation of philosophy rather than the establishment of facts.4 Harvey, however, approached perfection with his "strictly physiological method" that led him to test the implications of anatomical facts by "experiments on living animals."5 Today Foster's history would be dismissed as "Whiggish" or, at least, his approach would be very seriously questioned. He would be rightly chided for his insensitivity to proper intellectual context and his disrespect for older but historically legitimate standards of scientific explanation. It could easily be shown that Foster allowed little room for the possibility of a close interac- 1 Published by Cambridge University Press, 1901. 1 A few books and articles influenced by Foster are Kenneth J.

BROWN tion between philosophical assumptions and empirical discoveries, whereas more recent scholars have exhibited that interaction time and again.6 Now, three quarters of a century after Foster's Lectures, a reassessment of physiology during the Scientific Revolution and the eighteenth century is getting underway. Philosophical assumptions are being more seriously scrutinized, and new "facts" are being consistently understood as only pieces of more complicated patterns of thought.7 The work of René Des- cartes in particular, which Foster regarded as directly contributory to philosophy rather than physiology, is beginning to receive a closer scrutiny for its scientific content and influence. Scholars as various as Thomas S. Hall, Gustav Scherz and Luigi Belloni have begun to pay serious attention to Descartes' radically new, mechanical world view and its immediate, positive influence on his own and his contemporaries' physiology.8 Enough evidence has already accumulated to suggest that the Cartesian mechanical philosophy was a major, and perhaps even the major, influence on the course of physiological development in England in this period.9 Italy quite possibly showed similar trends.10 Few scholars would now deny that Car- tesianism was among the forces shaping physiological ideas from the mid- 1660s to at least the 1720s, whether, ultimately, for good or ill. Just how influential and constructive it was - compared, say, to the improvement of experimental technique - must be determined by further studies. But it is safe to venture that future scholarship will pay far more attention to the impact of Descartes and other mechanical philosophers than Foster even vaguely imagined necessary. The present essay is meant as a contribution to and a reinforcement of the recent trend to study closely the role of the mechanical philosophy in seventeenth-century physiology. It treats the first introduction of the Carte- sian philosophy in the physiology of England, where the period of initial invasion stretched, in a sense, from 1641 to 1664. Soon after the latter year • For this point in general, see Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 2nd edition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970).

Before the former year there was no mechanical philosophy in England to speak of and therefore none to intrude into the territory of physiology." Between 1641 and 1664 the philosophical landscape changed markedly, but even during the heady days of the Civil War and the Restoration - which cut through this period - the intrusion of the "new philosophy" into physiology was more like an incon- clusive and ambivalent incursion than a decisive and massive invasion. The new Cartesian philosophy was at first present only implicitly. Later, even after its arrival had been explicitly acknowledged, it was denied admittance in one quarter and allowed it only on special terms in another. Even where it entered there were curious attitudes. To understand the first interactions between the Cartesian mechanical philosophy and physiological thought in the one country where later interactions were the most evident in Europe, we must be prepared, therefore, to follow a complicated course along sev- eral different paths. The 1640s Cartesianism entered English physiology in the 1640s, but only in the most implicit and indirect way. Nowhere was its presence explicitly acknowl- edged, and in only two works could its faint imprint be seen at all. The first and more important of those two works was the Apologia pro circulatione sanguinis, published by George Ent in 1641. Ent was the son of a well-to-do Belgian merchant who had fled to England to avoid religious persecution in the Low Countries.12 After obtaining his Cambridge A.B. and A.M. in 1627 and 1631, Ent studied for five years at Padua, where he took his M.D. in 1636. Upon completing his studies, Ent remained for a while on the Continent, where Descartes in 1637 published his much anticipated Discourse on Method. It was doubtlessly while on the Continent for his extended period of study that Ent acquired the ideas, so strange for an English physician of his 11 Robert S. Kargon, Atomism in England (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), Chapters II-V, de- scribes the private flirtations with atomism of such figures as Thomas Harriot and Francis Bacon in the period before 1640. Since, however, these sympathies with ideas that were later to be generalized into the mechani- cal philosophy by Gassendi and Descartes were known only in small private circles, it can safely be said that were was no public mechanical philosophy in England before the 1640s and 1650s. Kargon' s comments on Bacon, p. 52, are telling: "During his lifetime and for many years afterwards, the earlier works favoring the atomic theory were not published .... the works of Bacon's mature period were all unfavorable to atomism. The mąjor atomistic works of 1603-12, the Cogitationes and the De Principii, were not published until 1653." 11 Biographical details from Charles Webster, "George Ent," in Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol.

The Apologia is a treatise of 284 pages.13 Written primarily as a rebuttal to Aemilio Parisanus' attempted refutation of Harvey's theory of circulation, the Apologia for the most part proceeds by taking up and then ridiculing each of Parisanus' arguments. In a large set of numbered paragraphs, Ent repeats Parisanus' reasoning, then uses classical and contemporary textual citations, careful logic, appeals to "experience" and heavy doses of sarcasm to rebut the rebuttal and thus re-establish Harvey's case and reputation. A typical paragraph begins this way: Your [Parisanus'] claim is that in a medium-tight ligature the vein becomes tumid below the band, because the blood above, in no way impeded by the ligature, is drawn there on account of the pain.14 The paragraph continues with a vigorous refutation of this opinion and con- cludes with a proud vindication of Harvey. Woven through these pointed rebuttals, however, is a series of extremely interesting "Digressions." Their principal interest derives from Ent's incor- poration in them of ideas which are not drawn from or, indeed, seem even compatible with Harvey's. In one Digression, for example, Ent considers the problem of "Attraction." He denies that there is any such thing in nature as the supposed "drawing power of the void"; the "horror vacui" is mean- ingless causally, because a nonentity (the void) cannot serve as an efficient cause.13 Ent likewise denies that purging medicines, as followers of Hippoc- rates and Galen claim, can attract suitable humors by an imagined "similar- ity" or "familiarity" of parts.18 Ent was here referring to the neoclassical doctrine that certain substances, both within and of importance to living bodies, have special appetent and even percipient properties which ordi- nary physical matter does not.17 Moreover, Ent directly disclaims belief in the various bodily "faculties," which classical and neoclassical medical u The füll title is: Apologia pro circulatione sanguinis ; qua respondetur / Emilio Parisano Medico Veneto (London, 1641). 14 Ent, Apologia, p. 212: "Tua sententia est; in mediocri ligatura venam infra vinculum intumescere, quia superior sanguis, nihil impediente ligaturâ, illuc prae dolore trahitur." 18 Ibid., pp. 28 ff.: " ... quia non entis nulla operatio. Quod enim non est, non potest agere: cùm actus secundus praesupponant primum. . . . Dico autem, à vera philosophia alienum esse, finalem causam pro efficiente assignare." "Ibid., p. 33. 17 We will return to the question of "similary attraction" later in this essay, when we discuss Francis Glisson' s Anatomia hepatis (1654).</page><page sequence="5">PHYSIOLOGY AND THE MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY 29 theory invoked to explain the attraction and retention of aliment and nutri- tive juice.18 Where nutriment seems to be specifically "attracted" into a particular living vessel or vital tissue, it is in actuality absorbed in the man- ner of fluid soaking into a sponge.19 Faculties in general are, in Enťs view, nothing more than the theatrical "deus ex machina" invoked everywhere to cloak our ignorance of true physiological processes.20 In other Digressions Ent introduces equally interesting ideas. He argues often that the heart has no innate pulsatile faculty, as Harvey supposed. Instead, the flame-like heat of the heart ignites the combustible materials in the blood, thus producing a sanguinary effervescence which pushes out the walls of the heart and, when bubbling over into the aorta and attached vessels, distends the arterial walls as well.21 A related opinion Ent also advocates is that the blood does not nourish the parts but merely serves as the vehicle for the heat and spirits which do properly vivify the body.22 Yet Ent conceives heat and spirits in remarkably physical and chemical terms. The cardiac heat often appears to act only according to the simple principles of chemical combustion.23 Moreover, when fresh aliment acquires the characteristics of blood, Ent seems to think that it does so in the manner of mere physical mixture, a view specifically denied in neoclassical doctrine.24 18 Ent, Apologia, pp. 40ff. For an account of what is called "neoclassical physiology" in this essay, see Lester S. King, "The transformation of Galenism," in Allen G. Debus (ed.), Medicine in Seventeenth Century England (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), pp. 7-31. 19 Ent, Apologia, p. 44. 20 Ibid., p. 40: "Si quaeras, unde cibi concoctio, chyli in venas distributio, ejusdem in sanguinem mutatio, &amp; c. statím, a facúltate aliqua id fieri, audies. Quod quid aliud est, quàm Déos advocare in theatrum, ut solvant nodum fabulae?" ilIbid., p. 49: "Veram autem hujus pulsûs causam arbitror, ipsius cordis primum impulsum: Nimirum sanguis in sinistro cordis ventrículo ebulliens, (ut postea explicabitur) sese in aortae ostium ingurgitât, unde dilatatur ipsius orificium, idémque motus ad extrema corporis perpetuatur: (quod nemini mirum videri debet qui motus celeritatem in corporibus tensis &amp; continuis non ignoraverit) postea, in systole suā sponte sub- sidit." Ent credits this notion to Aristotle, but it probably owes more to Descartes or writers of the Cartesian persuasion. For Descartes' views on heartbeat and their proximity to ideas in the Aristotelian tradition, see Étienne Gilson, Études sur le rôle de la pensée médiévale dans la formation du système cartésien, 3rd edition (Paris: J.

BROWN Finally, digestive concoction is not the substantial alteration of foodstuff taking place under the instrumentality of innate heat and guided by an ap- propriate set of faculties; rather, a chemical fermentation induced by an acid humor activated by heat constitutes the whole process of digestion.25 What all these novel ideas in Ent's Digressions add up to, of course, is an episodic critique of neoclassical physiology, still dominant in the early 1640s. For in place of directive teleology, special vital principles, and unique and appetent living substances, Ent substituted a philosophical rejoinder to explanatory teleology, deliberately unqualified physical analogies, and straightforward applied chemistry. The unnamed source for many of these innovations could well have been Descartes, for in the introduction to his treatise Ent warmly praises Henry Regius, one of the best-known Cartesian disciples of the day.26 Ent's ideas, at any rate, seem to echo several of Descartes', both in their particulars and in their general thrust.27 And even if Ent may not have acknowledged all of his sources, his Apologia contained much that was new and, therefore, much that was potentially disturbing. Despite their originality in the English setting, Ent's implicitly Cartesian views were greeted largely in silence. Physiological ideas of the early seven- teenth century apparently continued in force, little if at all affected. The Professor of Physick at Gresham College until 1642 was Thomas Winston, a man of standard and static views; from 1643 to 1652 it was Paul de Laune, a minor figure who left no surviving literary or philosophical remains.28 At Oxford in the early 'forties business largely proceeded as usual.

Aff.3# Later in the 'forties there was a brief flurry of activity when William Harvey settled in Oxford for a few years, but Harvey's presence was important not for what it stimulated or affected in the 'forties but for what was remembered of it in the very different decade of the 'fifties.31 For Cambridge there is somewhat more specific information, and most of it points in the same continuously traditional direction. The holder of the Regius Professorship there from 1636 to 1676 was Francis Glisson, a notable figure who will prove increasingly important as this essay unfolds. Born in 1597, Glisson received his A.B., A.M., mid M.D. degrees from Cambridge in 1621, 1624 and 1634.82 He was elected Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1635. Sometime after he won appointment as Regius Professor, although it is not now known exactly when, he moved back to Cambridge, at least for a while, and assumed his lecturing duties. From manuscript notes surviving early lectures apparently delivered in the late 'thirties and early 'forties, Glisson seems to have been a fairly conservative young man, little influ- enced by the sorts of ideas Ent espoused. Among the issues he argued publicly as Regius Professor in these years are the following: Humors are electively attracted to ones similar to themselves. Sanguification is a similary action. Nutrition is performed through similary attraction. 1659) [posthumous publication], p. 62: "... the Fundus ... is almost seated in the middle Region of the Epigastrion, of the bottome of the stomach: It is not the most fleshy part ... yet it is the seat of chylosis, which is from the inborn property and specificali form, and innate heat of the stomach "There were two Thomas Claytons, who are sometimes confused. Thomas Clayton the older stepped down as Regius Professor in 1647 and turned the chair over to his son, a much less distinguished man. Clayton senior is given high praise by A. H. T.

Purgation is performed by the similitude of substance.33 If these titles are properly representative, as they seem to be, Glisson' s views would appear to have remained well within the bounds of neoclassical orthodoxy. At Ent's own College of Physicians the situation was somewhat different, though not radically. The College seems to have been intellectually fluid or, perhaps rather, ambivalent in these years. William Harvey, George Ent, Francis Glisson and Thomas Winston were all well regarded Fellows at this time. Moreover, the College tentatively experimented with aspects of "modernity," in 1648 appointing an official chemist who was responsible for the preparation of new sorts of medicaments.34 Yet at the same time, the Fellows in 1647 adopted several new statutes but retained the old one requir- ing a rigorous examination in Hippocrates and Galen of all future members.35 Introduced into this context, the sorts of ideas Ent espoused would be re- ceived mostly in silence, but they would also, it would seem, begin to win some sympathetic hearing. The evidence for an at least partially sympathetic reception comes from lectures delivered by Baldwin Harney in 1648. Harney was an active member of the College in these years and a personal friend of William Harvey.36 Elected Fellow early in the 1630s, Harney rose steadily in the ranks of the College in the next two decades. In the 1640s he served as Censor and in 1647 was selected to give the College anatomy lectures - in January, 1648. In these public lectures Harney expressed many views which were incompati- ble with the neoclassical doctrines he himself had previously written and which, therefore, seem to exhibit some sympathy for the new directions in which Ent had begun to move.37 The format of Harney's Praelectiones is the standard seventeenth-century 33 British Museum.

At the termini and in between he exhibits the detailed structure of the parts, cites notable classical and Ren- aissance authorities where relevant, and occasionally intersperses his de- scriptive accounts with physiological explanations. When he treats the liver, heart, or kidneys, he breaks off his description and citations to offer a theory of organic function. It is in these theoretical excursions that Harney seems to show something of Ent's innovative spirit. Harney's description of kidney function is most clearly representative of the new directions in which his ideas were moving. After explaining at some length that Galen reasoned his way to an innate attractive faculty in the substance of the kidneys by first assuming that the blood did not and could not circulate, Harney, an advocate of circulation, offers his own detailed and contrary account of renal action: Now then . . . [since] our kidneys were made to separate water from blood, and that we conceive all our blood must at one time or other passe by them to affect it, let us at present see of what use all the particulars be in their Structure, for the making out of the same. With Galen, the Temper of a part is usually the principali cause of its action, and this temper is its IDIOSYNCRASIS; but here we need not urge any hidden property, since we gave a manifest quality, wch, I conceive, to be, a more moderate heat, than is found in the adjacent parts: for, if the blood wch floweth with strong pulsation and ebullition from the Aorta by the emulgents, were not by its diversion to the kidneys somewhat qualified, then will all separation of urine be inconceavable; and, for this cause, we have grounds enough to imagine, that the kidneys were thrust aside, as farre as might be, and there covered with abundance of fat, the fittest Vestment for a moderate temper, by keeping of both heat and cold too, whose extreames doe equally hinder separation. And of this we have some evidence upon letting of blood, from wch the Serum is not secerned, but upon a . . . declination, from a boiling, to a moderate heat, before it comes to the other extreame of coldnesse: for, if at first it be received in a large cold Vessel, or in a small quantity, or by drops in any thing whatsoever, the blood will seeme good . . . [but] because it had no considerable time to change in, from one extreame to the other; for it is heat, accord- ing to that [opinion] of Aristotles . . . that separates heterogeneous bodies, but it must not be too fervent . . . .39 This explanation, based on the simple physical effects of heat and cold, was obviously formulated as an alternative to the neoclassical notion of the 38 Harney's Praelectiones is also an unpublished manuscript now in the Library of the Royal College of Physicians, London.

In fact, just how heterodox Harney's ac- count was can be seen by comparing it to the explanation of renal function William Harvey had offered to the College in his own anatomical Praelec- tiones of 1616: . . . urine is excreted in the same manner as the others through its proper channels like the excretion of gall and of sperm .... As to whether it moves by attraction or explusion etc., the answer in one word is that the originator of everything in the body is innate heat; it exists in everything even in all the excrements while they are governed by Nature. Innate heat as it concocts both attracts and expels. For this reason just as the food designed to nourish the parts is partly conveyed to them by the digestive faculty and partly attracted to them and partly seeks them spontaneously, so the excrements partly seek a way out, partly sink down to wherever there is a way out and are in part attracted and in part expelled. Unnatural excrements which are not governed by Nature are productive of disease and by their malignity seek differ- ent parts of the body as the bones, the legs etc., and the lungs. Just as it is in the world so is it in the microcosm, all things are moved of their own accord to their proper place. Wherefore whosoever says they are driven or attracted implies that they will be moved by an accord that is other than their own. Compare Aristotle's remarks in De generatione, Book II, ch. 4. And indeed excrement is discharged in accordance with its own nature. Movement by means of attraction, however, does exist in the body, for example, heat, pain and a vacuum all attract, the one lust, the other a purgatory and the third something to chew.40 Set in contrast, these two quotations clearly suggest that while Harvey in 1616 and Harney in 1648 may have conceived themselves as moving in the same basically "Aristotelian" direction, Hamey obviously moved much farther towards a "mechanical" or physicalist explanation. His account of renal action is more consistently based on simple physical operations and his language here is free of references to such neoclassical entities as "innate heat," "attraction" and "faculty." Hamey quite possibly moved this far because, like Ent and perhaps under the same unnamed philosophical influ- ence, he put much more stock than Harvey in the operation of simple physi- cal principles within the body. Harney's apparent resonance with Ent, however, was not everywhere so strong. In several other of his physiological explanations, he shows little sympathy for the more daring kinds of ideas contained in Ent' s Apologia and its "Digressions." He nowhere seriously entertains the chemical and mechanical analogies Ent introduced, and he is often content to retain neo- classical vocabulary and conceptions. Thus, one prime action of the stomach * William Harvey, Praelectiones anatomie universalis , ed. &amp; trans.

His anatomical Praelectiones contain certain definite hints of modern influence and of a general progressiveness (he clearly and consistently defended Har- vey's theory of the circulation of the blood), but they also show unmistaka- ble signs of neoclassical residues. Neoclassical residues in a generally forward-looking set of lectures can be accounted for in terms of an under- standable and almost predictable conceptual inertia, and in this regard Hamey very likely spoke for many others at the College as well. The College of Physicians was ambivalent in the 1640s; for every Ent there was a Winston, and Hamey fell in between. Given this environment in what was then England's most progressive medical institution, it is no wonder that the 1640s saw no fundamental change in England's pre-mechanical physiology. The 1650s and Early 1660s By 1650 the general situation in England was very different from what it had been ten years before.48 New ideas percolated in very recently formed intellectual circles, and there was suddenly a host of new scientific and philosophical personalities. Political and social life was extraordinarily un- settled. England was in the midst of a revolution and had just witnessed the rise to power of the Army within the Parliamentary ranks, the execution of King Charles I, and the establishment of the Commonwealth. Parliament itself was frequently attacked by Oliver Cromwell and his more radical Army followers, suid several of England's other established institutions were sub- ject to thorough, often scurrilous abuse by violent elements in society sud- denly given license by the tumultuous turnings of events.44 In the late 'forties several of the political radicals had already tried to strengthen their position 41 Hamey, op. cit.

BROWN by aligning themselves with new intellectual currents, so that by the early 'fifties the atmosphere was so multiply tense that William Harvey could express his reaction to contemporary philosophical tendencies only in out- raged, bitter terms. According to John Aubrey, Harvey in 1651 . . . bid me goe to the Fountain head, and read Aristotle, Cicero, Avicenna, and did call the Neoteriques shift breeches.4s Times and tempers were clearly changing. One immediately significant development of these strange times was the sudden ready availability of all sorts of books with every kind of new and striking idea. Old printing and publishing restrictions had recently been al- tered as a consequence of Civil War,46 and coming in the wake of these alterations were scores of treatises and tracts which gave expression to highly articulated alternatives to traditional academic philosophy and neo- classical medicine.47 The works of such famous foreign authors as Paracelsus, van Helmont and Gassendi were suddenly available in England and even in English.48 But much more significantly, Descartes' Discourse on Method and Passions of the Soul - full and free-standing accounts of the dramatic Cartesian physiology founded on the principles of Descartes' equally dramat- ic mechanical philosophy - appeared in English editions of 1649 and 1650.49 Here were explicit statements that the human body is nothing but a machine or engine, a physical contrivance whose organs, vessels, fluids and vapors are identical in composition and operation to the parts of clocks or other automata. This was a radically new, completely physicalist and fully "mechanical" approach to the "animal oeconomy" that the guardians and spokesmen for English physiology had to reckon with. It was against this background or, at least, in this atmosphere, that much 45 Aubrey's Brief Lives, (ed.) Oliver Lawson Dick (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1957), p. 129.

At Oxford, Cambridge, the College of Physicians and, in a sense, at Gresham College too - the well-established loci of such English physiology as then existed - activity proceeded to some extent along lines previously drawn during the first five decades of the century. Scholastic exercises continued in the Ox- ford and Cambridge medical faculties, and the classically-based examination statute remained in force at the College of Physicians.50 But because the cir- cumstances of the 'fifties were in many ways so striking and strange, physiology itself became different too. In various, not always subtle ways environing circumstances and the erosion of traditional conceptions caused by the active presence of the several new and antagonistic philosophies exercised a palpable influence on physiological thought and practice. Even in the new decade, however, changes came neither abruptly nor uniformly. Institutions at which physiology was pursued varied, had subtly different traditions and recent histories, and possessed unique constellations of personalities. Thus, those interested in physiology at the College of Physicians during the 'fifties were prepared to respond differently from those at Oxford. Indeed, the differences in response are quite as interesting and important as the commonality of the stimulus. Let us consider first the London College of Physicians, which by 1650 had already begun to feel rumblings of change within its own ranks. It was at this time that a small but energetic group of Fellows tried with some success to import the sorts of ideas and activities with which they had recently become involved in meetings at Gresham College, where, a few years earlier, an extramural scientific club had crystallized.51 Often consisting of the Col- lege's Drs. Jonathan Goddard, George Ent, Francis Glisson and Christopher Merret, along with such prominent figures of Civil War London as John Wilkins, John Wallis and Theodore Haak, the Gresham group functioned as an informal but high level discussion club wtïich met regularly to consider reports of recently advanced ideas and discoveries. The purpose of these meetings was to exchange new and general scientific information; specific topics in anatomy and physiology held considerable interest for the medically-biased group of participants. By 1649, however, the Gresham discussion club had disbanded. Several of its members went to Oxford (where we will follow their activities later in this 50 On conservatism at Oxford and Cambridge in the 1650s, see Kearney, op. cit. (n. 45 above), pp. 120ff; for the College of Physicians, see above, n. 33. 51 See Margery Purver, The Royal Society: Concept and Creation (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1967), pp. 161 ff.</page><page sequence="14">38 THEODORE M. BROWN essay), but three of the physicians in the original group remained in London and turned their attention to organizing their colleagues within the College of Physicians into a Bacon-style collaborative research club.52 They were perhaps motivated in part by a half-conscious and quasi-political desire to defend their College by pursuing experimental activities and thus forestalling the attacks of certain radical critics. In any case, as we noted earlier, the College appointed an official chemist in 1648, and his laboratory became one main locus of activity and interest. In addition, a group of eight, including Glisson and Goddard, studied the "new disease," rickets, and in 1650 Glis- son published their collective findings in a volume entitled De rachitide. 53 Interest in the next few years widened to include research into anatomical and physiological subjects, and in a short time the prevailing mood at the College was such that the annual lecturers felt free to abandon their pre- scribed general anatomy format, to use their appointments instead as some- thing like research posts. In this self-consciously "Baconian" atmosphere of the College of Physi- cians investigations were undertaken into the functioning of the parts of the "animal oeconomy," a term then coming into popular usage. The most important studies were pursued by Francis Glisson, still the Regius Profes- sor of Medicine at Cambridge but in the 'forties and 'fifties a semi-permanent resident of London.54 Glisson' s research culminated in the Anatomia hepatis of 1654, a work notable both for its solid scientific achievements and for the insights it yields into deep-seated neoclassical attitudes towards physiologi- cal explanation maintained by even the most progressive members of the mid-century College of Physicians. The subject of Glisson' s investigations was the structure and function of the liver, one of the three most important organs in neoclassical physiology. According to Galen and his later-day followers, the liver performs the crucial task of fashioning blood out of the partially digested food brought from the 52 See Charles Webster, "The College of Physicians: 'Solomon's House' in Commonwealth England," Buli.

Stevenson, " 'New diseases' in the seventeenth century," Bull. Hist. Med., 1965, 39: pp. 1-21. 54 On Glisson's peregrinations, see n. 32 above. Other important studies, though not in Glisson' s class, were undertaken by Thomas Wharton, also of the College. These were published as Adenographia: sive glan- dularum totius corporis descriptio (London, 1656).

But in the light of Harvey's and other seventeenth-century discoveries the liver could not be seen any longer to perform these functions. The theory of circulation required that blood be already formed before it reaches the liver on its course through the body. Harvey also reported embryological evidence that revealed the liver first appearing after the blood was fashioned.58 Moreover, recent discoveries by Continental anatomists created further doubts about the traditional hepatic function. In 1622 Gaspar Aselli discovered the chyle-absorbing lacteals, and about twenty-five years later Jean Pecquet found that these vessels delivered chyle not to the liver, as Aselli had supposed, but through a separate vascu- lar system into the vena cava and then the heart.57 Pecquet' s discovery demanded an immediate adjustment of the traditional theory of hepatic func- tion, and Pecquet himself tried to supply a "modern" alternative. A traveller in philosophical circles where Descartes' ideas were popular, he argued that the liver, instead of fashioning blood, acted primarily as a filter to separate bile mechanically from the circulating blood mass.58 A large quantity of bile-containing blood regularly soaks into the hepatic parenchyma, but then a dual excretion mechanism, depending on the size and shape of both the blood particles and the sieve-like openings in the liver, operates to filter out bile from the sanguinary fluid.59 Bile passes into the gall-bladder and purified blood continues on its circuit.

The principal Latin passage in Pecquet' s writings on which this judgment is based is quoted by Mani in Die historischen Grundlagen (n. 57 above), p. 431, n. 41 as follows: "Ita cribralium demeaculorum variētas, et colandorum corporum diversa confîguratio fluidis hoc transitu interdicit, iliac autem concedit eñugium.

BROWN were published in the early 'fifties, when they contributed to a bitter Conti- nental debate over hepatic function.60 Glisson started where this debate left off. Thus, to test Fecqueťs notion that the liver merely separates excremental bile from circulating blood in a mechanical fashion, Glisson devoted considerable attention to exploring in exquisite detail how the facts of hepatic microstructure might suit the liver to a sieve-like secretory function.61 He began by uncovering the complicated network of vessels inside and outside the liver. Using the best techniques of recent Continental anatomy and proceeding with great caution, he made the intricate vascular connections beautifully clear. By excarnation, inflation and injection he shows that the two major biliary vessels, the porus biliarius and the meatus cysticus, are distributed along with the branches of the portal vein and the vena cava throughout the hepatic parenchyma.62 Capillary roots of the bile-containing vessels are always found associated with capillary roots of the blood-containing vessels. Reflecting a major concern of William Harvey, Glisson shows, however, that there are no direct vascular anas- tomoses.63 This can only mean, he reasons, that blood carrying bile is brought into the liver, where it discharges its contents into parenchymatous spaces; the bilious portion then enters the biliary vessels, which in turn transport the separated bile back outside the liver either into the intestines or 80 For the Continental debate, which also involved Bartholin, Riolan and Rudbeck, see Mani, Die historis- chen Grundlagen, pp. 90 ff. 81 Ibid., pp. 104-120. Mani calls Glisson's more than five hundred page work "eine grosse Monographie" and comments, p. 105, "Dieses Werk wurde für zwei Jahrhunderte grundlagen und richtungsweisend." 82 Glisson, op. cit. (n. 56 above), p. 267: "Vasa haec . . . in eo consentiunt, quod eorum quodlibet ramús- culos capillares in unamquamque parenchymatis partem distribuât. Nullam scilicet hepatis partem, quae sit alicujus momenti, reperias, ad quam venae cavae. Portae, atque pori bilarii capillaria vasa non pertingant." 83 Harvey had been concerned to establish this point beyond any doubt as recently as 1649 in his Exercitatio de circulatione sanguinis (Cambridge, 1649). See especially pp. 137-138 of the Everyman edition (London, 1963) for a passage that may have influenced Glisson: "I myself, with what diligence has been mine to command, have sought hard and have expended not a little of both time and effort in anastomosis exploring. But I have never succeeded in finding vessels, namely, arteries with veins, mutually connecting by inoscula- tion .... [For] there is [in fact] no anastomosis at all in the liver or spleen or lungs or kidneys or any other viscus. When these had been boiled until the whole of the parenchyma had been rendered friable and a sort of powder had been prepared and needled out from all the vascular fibres, I should have been able to see all the fibre of any division and all the capillary threads, had such existed. I dare, therefore, boldly assert that there is no anastomosis of the portal veins with the cava, or of arteries with veins, or of the small capillary branchlets of the bile duct, which are dispersed through the whole moulding of the liver, with the veins. This can be seen in a fresh liver only; all the branches of the vena cava, creeping through the gibbous portion of the liver, have coats riddled with innumerable small holes, as if in a sink constructed for the reception of the blood in its descent. The branches of the portal vein are not similarly arranged, but are divided into offshoots; and both distributions of these vessels, one in the flat part, the other in the gibbous, run everywhere without anastomosis to the portal fissure of the viscus."</page><page sequence="17">PHYSIOLOGY AND THE MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY 41 into the special bile receptacle, the gall bladder. In general, The office of the liver is no other than some depuration of the blood. It is indeed very probable, that the blood is purified in various manners. Namely, the kidneys dis- charge salt and terrestrious excrement mixed and diluted with the urine; the pancreas similarly evacuates other material . . . and several other parts are endowed with this peculiar kind of function. Thus, if we regard the liver as if it were the part designated for the depuration of the blood, and also if we consider the gall bladder annexed to it and the biliary vessel distributed throughout the hepatic parenchyma, then we ought to say that the liver has been instituted by Nature in order to render the blood cleansed of bile.64 By concentrating all this attention on the hepatic vessels and by emphasiz- ing the liver's secretory role, Glisson would seem, like Pecquet, to be driving primarily at a mechanical, sieve-like function for the organ. Suddenly impressed with recent Continental philosophy as well as anatomy, it might appear, he was departing from his prior, strongly-held commitment to the neoclassi- cal physiological tradition. But this was not the case, at least not in impor- tant ways. For though Glisson sometimes referred to the liver as a "sieve," he neither spoke of the blood as a purely hydraulic fluid nor thought of the liver and its vessels as a mechanical device. As far as blood was concerned, Glisson maintained along with Harvey and other, less daring predecessors, that it was a living and architectonic fluid infused with vital heat.65 In fact, the blood is first created neither by the liver, the heart, nor the veins, but by the vital spirit residing in the original seminal matter of the ovum.66 And as for the supposedly sieve-like operation of the liver, Glisson was particularly careful, as Pecquet was not, to distinguish between mere mechanical filtra- tion and the special, vital secretion of bile that actually takes place in the hepatic parenchyma. Glisson based his explanation of biliary secretion on the notion of "similar M Glisson, op. cit. (n. 56 above), p. 411: " ... officium illi aliud nullum superest; praeter aliqualem sanguinis depurationem.

BROWN attraction." This idea was both a part of the neoclassical tradition and a conception closely related to "faculties." The neoclassical scheme main- tained that certain parts of the body were endowed with special, quasi- percipient or appetent powers which allowed them to attract, retain, expel and alter suitable materials These were properties which only living tissues could possess. For example, although a hollow bladder can attract matter by the physical principle of "horror vacui," only the walls of the mesenteric veins can attract chyle from the material in the intestines and only the flesh of the kidneys can selectively absorb urinous matter from the mass of the blood.67 Glisson located an equivalent, distinctively vital, non-mechanical sort of attraction in the hepatic vessels within the liver.68 He also claimed that the hepatic parenchyma itself helped separate bile from blood not by a sieve-like filtration but by a selective and "similar" attraction which acted by an "actual exertion to mutual intercourse."88 Thus, The capillary vessels minister to the parenchyma, and distribute the bilious blood into all the parts equally .... This part of the separation is mechanical. But the similar parts pertain primarily to the parenchyma of the liver, although they are also closely related to both kinds - biliary and sanguinary - of vessels. For it is indeed probable, that the parenchyma is constituted of different kinds of parts, and, because of this, that certain humors are joined to one and certain others to another. Thus, the humors apply themselves to those parts with which they have the greatest similitude and affinity. And it is thus that secretion begins. Specifically, the particles of the parenchyma which have the greatest familiarity with the biliary humor, attract it to them and direct it to the opening of the biliary duct. Likewise, those particles which are most like pure blood, attract it to the capillary extremities of the vena cava. In the meantime, nevertheless, those roots of both the biliary duct and the vena cava, assist the parenchyma in this task by their own similar attraction.70 Hepatic secretion, clearly, is not entirely sieve-like. It depends on similar essences and their mutual (anthropomorphic) perception. By insisting on this similar attraction, Glisson deliberately and carefully built a non- mechanical operation right into the liver's principal function. m See Brock's edition, op. cit. (n. 55 above), pp. 275 ff. m Glisson, op. cit. (n. 56 above), 246: Dixi . . . attractionem similarem, ut ab organica sive medianica distingueront.

Contrary to Descartes and his assorted advocates, Glisson seems to have wanted to show where the mechanical philosophy failed and broke down, rather than where it succeeded or opened up interesting new possibilities. This attitude was certainly evident at several other places in his book. At one point, for example, he ridicules a popular corpuscular type of explanation,71 and at several other places he deliberately resorts at length to the vocabulary and conceptions of neoclassical physiology (including the invocation of "faculties") to supplement the fluid mechanics of bile storage and distribu- tion.72 The recently intruded mechanical philosophy had no place, or at least no important and unchallenged place, in Glisson' s physiology. Glisson' s reasons for maintaining this essentially conservative position were doubtlessly multiple and various. He was trained in and himself taught neoclassical medicine at Cambridge, and this helped keep his physiological conceptions traditional. Furthermore, he was a colleague, associate and ad- mirer of William Harvey, who in his latter years became increasingly pug- nacious in his opposition to the "neoteriques." Glisson was also an impor- tant figure in the London College of Physicians at the same time that Baldwin Hamey was especially prominent; as we have seen above, Hamey sanguinem biliosum in omnes ejus partes aequabiliter deponit .... Estque ista separations hujus pars mechanica. Partes ejusdem similares, primario ad hepatis parenchyma, proximo autem loco ad utrunque vasorum auferentium genus spectant. Verisimile equidem est parenchyma e partibus diversimodis constitui; aliasque humoram excernendoram uni, alias alteri conveniere: quo fît, ut humores illi se ipsis intercediti estque istud secretionis eoram in it i um.

Similiter, particulae illae, quibus cum sanguine puro potissimium res est, hune ad se attrahunt, posteaque ad capillares radicum cavae extremitates deducunt. Interim tarnen radices illae, tum pori bilarii, turn venae cavae, similari sua attractione paren- chymal in hoc negotio opitulantur." 71 Ibid., pp. 241 ff., where Glisson rejects the effluvial explanation of magnetic attraction. n Ibid., pp. 165-166: "Idque factum videtur, quia bilis in vesícula ista copiose accumulali debuit; ac propterea exitum illius per meatum cysticum plurimum arc tari par erat, ope fibrosi anuli, qui in ipsa eoram connexione adnascitur; quemadmodum in proximo capite luculentius constabit. Alias enim, si vesícula fellea (ut saepe fit) ad ejiciendam bilem vehementer extimularetur; quoniam iter rectum est, bilisque copia semper adest, fieri non posset, quin eadem, summo cum partis illius, in quam vas illud fertur, periculo, reflue rat. Irritatio enim, fibraram omnium contractionem adfert; unde idem usu venit, quod a compressione aliter contingeret." Cf. Owsei Temkin's important study, "The classical roots of Glisson' s doctrine of irritation," Bull. Hist. Med., 1964, 38: 297-328. Temkin, pp. 325-325, concludes that, "Glisson's doctrine of irritation has been shown to be deeply rooted in the classical tradition, which means the teaching of the schools prevailing during the first half of the seventeenth century. . . . Though Galen did not conceptualize 'irritation' as Glisson did, both dealt with the same kind of phenomena in a very similar way." Temkin also points out, pp. 310-311, that Glisson continued to refer to explusive "faculties."</page><page sequence="20">44 THEODORE M. BROWN was anything but an undaunted "modernist." Finally, in the 1650s Glisson was also a public "Baconian," and this possibly seemed to him a politically suitable and personally sufficient concession to philosophical modernity.73 In any case, whatever his precise complex of personal reasons and institu- tional motivations, Glisson' s mental set was the one that dominated the College of Physicians well into the 1660s. With Glisson holding the neoclas- sical line and with no mechanically-inclined philosopher in its ranks to offer an alternative, the mechanical philosophy hardly entered there into the do- main of physiology. Quite different tendencies were evident at the universities. Here the tradi- tional, medically-circumscribed and scholastic form of physiology continued in part, but new sorts of activity and a new body of physiological ideas, sometimes of the Cartesian kind, were also becoming evident. Research at Cambridge proved limited and evanescent, but by the end of the 1650s Oxford had become the home of a sophisticated group actively pursuing several sets of physiological investigations while being definitely committed at the same time to aspects of the mechanical philosophy.74 The Oxford group - including such members as Robert Wilkins, Seth Ward, Christopher Wren, John Wallis, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, Thomas Willis and Richard Lower - undertook an extensive series of exper- iments into all sorts of problems. Sprat specifically mentions chemistry and mechanics in his retrospective History of the Royal Society (1667), and in addition there is evidence for investigations into astronomy, pneumatics and optics.75 Also prominent among the areas of inquiry were matters of deep physiological significance. One principal source for these physiological con- cerns was William Petty, who was with the group briefly.76 Another can be 73 Glisson' s role in the College of Physician's public "Baconianism" has been referred to above. Moreover, he scattered several Baconian phrases throughout the Anatomia hepatis. For example, on p. 50 he makes the following telltale remark: "Hie solum addam, (quod ad poros particulatim spectat) si liquor injectus, partis alicujus habitům penetrans, eundem totum aequaliter tinxerit; videtur adesse Instantia Crucis, quā indicatur, fluxum ilium non fieri per poros, sed per ipsam partis substantiam: sin autem discretim innumerabilia duntaxat veluti puncta infecerit; clarum indicium est, poros ibidem reperiri." 74 Oxford physiology will be described in the pages below. The most important, though transitory work at Cambridge was done by Henry Power. On Power and his research efforts, see Charles Webster, "Henry Power's experimental philosophy," Ambix, 1967, 14: 150-178, and F. J. Cole, "Henry Power on the circulation of the blood," J. Hist.

The composition and functional significance of the blood was much discussed;78 heartbeat was actively examined by vivisectional techniques;79 and experiments were even tried on something like transfu- sion.80 Robert Boyle, the premier virtuoso of the Oxford group, offered evidence in his later writings for earlier Oxonian interest in these matters.81 Another major concern of Harvey during his Oxford days, respiration, was also frequently examined by members of the Oxford scientific group. Ralph Bathurst, brother of a Harvey associate of the 'forties, was a major figure in Oxford science in the 'fifties; he delivered three lectures on respiration in 1654 as part of the public performance for his M.D.82 Robert Boyle picked up these themes a few years later.83 With the help of his talented young assistant, Robert Hooke, Boyle developed an air pump with which he explored the properties of atmospheric air and the phenomena of fire and respiration.84 Results of the Hooke-Boyle collaboration at Oxford were reported in 1660 in Boyle's New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall , Touching the Spring of the Air , and Its Effects.

BROWN the bird for a while appeared lively enough; but upon a greater exsuction of the air, and very soon after was taken with as violent and irregular convulsions, as are wont to be observed in poultry, when their heads are wrung off . . . 85 The gentleman-amateur Boyle, without medical degree or formal institu- tional position, was clearly pushing out the boundaries of respiratory physiology, a subject to which William Harvey, Royal and Collegiate physi- cian, had given the greatest prior impetus. In addition to Harveian concerns, however, other physiological problems likewise drew consistent attention from the Oxford scientists. Among the most important of these were questions of neurological control and cerebral function. Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle and a group led by Thomas Willis were the Oxonians most intimately involved with these matters. Bathurst introduced neuro-cerebral issues in his lectures on respiration,88 and Boyle included extensive reports of vivisectional experiments among his physiological observations.87 Boyle's activity notwithstanding, it was Thomas Willis who explored neuro-cerebral function most extensively. Willis was a physician who had spent several productive years in Oxford as a medical practitioner and an eager general scientist.88 After receiving his M.B. degree in 1646, he associated with Petty, Wilkins and other members of the Oxford scientific circle in the early 1650s. Later in the 'fifties he estab- lished a close relationship with Richard Lower, a talented younger man who 85 Boyle, Works, op. cit. (n. 79 above), vol. 1, p. 97. 86 Bathurst, op. cit.

Willis also enjoyed the scientific services of Christopher Wren, Savilian Professor of Astronomy after 1661, and profited from the friendship of Thomas Millington, M. D. A professed Anglican in Puritan Oxford, Willis had to await the Restoration before re- ceiving a professorial appointment. He was rewarded in August 1660 when university authorities designated him Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy. In October he received his Oxford M.D. In the years following his appointment as Sedleian Professor Willis or- ganized Lower, Wren and Millington into something like a research team that helped him produce a large, general and serious work on neurocerebral physiology. Published early in 1664 as Cerebri anatome, the book covered approximately two hundred and fifty octavo pages of Latin text and was illustrated with plates contributed by Wren and Lower. It is organized into two main sections.89 The first, about two-thirds of the book, is "The Anatomy of the Brain"; the second is "The Description and Uses of the Nerves." Both sections are anatomically founded but functionally oriented.90 Among Willis' principal contentions about function - all based on care- fully presented if later questioned anatomical evidence - are that the animal spirits are manufactured from arterial blood in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex by a distillation-like chemical process;91 that the wavelike movement of the animal spirits in various medullary tracts is the immediate cause of mental and sensory acts;99 and, specifically, that inwardly directed undula- tions of the spirits are associated with sensation, whereas outwardly directed ones (i.e. from the convolutions of the cerebral cortex through the medullary substance of the cerebrum and out into the medulla oblongata and the nerves) are connected with memory, will and appetite.98 Willis also discuss- es the vessels of cerebral circulation, describes in intricate detail the dis- ••On editions of Cerebri anatome, see H.

BROWN tribution of the principal nerves, and offers hypotheses for the manner of muscular motion.94 Perhaps Willis' most important concern, however, was to distinguish be- tween voluntary and involuntary functions in man and in the different behaviors of higher and lower animals. To make these distinctions, Willis differentiated sharply between the respective roles in the ''animal oeconomy" of the cere- brum and the cerebellum. The cerebrum is the prime seat of the rational soul in man, of the sensitive in animals; it is also the source of voluntary move- ments and ideas and the locus of imagination, memory and thought. By contrast, the cerebellum controls and regulates - through its separate store of animal spirits and attendant nerves - automatic and involuntary motions such as heartbeat, respiration and peristalsis.95 There are some actions, however, which are mixed or crossed. That is, extreme mental agitation may affect the heartbeat or breathing pattern, and unusual discomfort in the digestive tract may afflict the mind. Willis explains: The reason of these is, partly because the Nerves of either Government communicate variously among themselves with shoots sent forth one to another, so that often times the offices of the one are drawn into the parts of the other. But besides ... the sensible impression being inflicted on the parts of the involuntary Function, foras- much as it is vehement, like a strong waving of waters, passing through the Cerebel, affects the Brain it self. In like manner it may be thought concerning the motion which belongs to those parts, viz . that made after the ordinary manner, that it is performed by the command of the Cerebel. Notwithstanding some more severe Edicts of the Brain, by the by-passage of the Prominences, belong also to the Cere- bel, and determine the Offices of the Inhabitants of it to be performed at the beck of the Appetite.96 On this basis Willis could explain both reflexive action in man and the characteristic differences between men and lower animals. Unconscious re- flex behaviors occur in man when moderately strong incurrent undulations of the animals spirits are reflected into a motor pathway before they reach the cerebrum and, thus, consciousness.97 In lower animals, the cerebellum and other parts of involuntary function are invariably well developed in comparison with the cerebrum and its nerves, so that almost all functions of such animals can be performed automatically with the greatest efficiency.98 94 Ibid., pp. 129 and 135 for the latter. 95 Ibid., p. 111.

The behavior of brutes, largely automatic, can be considered machine-like; man, with his unusually well-developed cerebrum and intri- cate interconnections between the voluntary and involuntary control sys- tems, is a far more complex contrivance. Thus, . . . Brutes are like Machines framed with a more simple furniture and with less workmanship, and therefore furnished with a motion of one kind only, or determined for the doing still the same thing. But in Man divers series of motions, and as it were complications of wheels within wheels, appear." This passage is extremely interesting. For it not only conveys Willis' meaning with apt language and particular forcefulness, it is also representa- tive of several other mechanical metaphors scattered throughout Cerebri anatome and derived from Descartes. Thus, when Willis wishes to describe the recurrent regularity of those actions under cerebellar control, he uses the following verbal device: ... the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel perform unperceivedly and silently their works of Nature without our knowledge or care. Wherefore whilst the Brain [Cerebrum] is garnished as it were with uncertain Meanders and crankling turnings and windings about, the compass of this [Cerebellum] is furnished with folds and lappets disposed in an orderly series; in the spaces of which, as in designed Orbs and Tracts, the animal Spritis are expanded according to the Rule and Method naturally impressed on them. For indeed those in the Cerebel, as it were in a certain artificial Machine or Clock, seem orderly disposed after that manner within certain little places and boun- daries, that they may flow out orderly of their own accord one series after another without any driver, which may govern or moderate their motions.1" This, unmistakably, is Descartes' vocabulary. Although, later in the text, Willis makes only oblique and passing reference to Descartes' "Doctrine of the Passions of the Soul," this passage and many others can only be under- stood in the context of Willis' undoubted familiarity with and warm praise for Cartesian physiology.101 Willis' use of Cartesian analogies and metaphors, however, is not quite so dominant a feature of Cerebri anatome as the two passages above would seem to suggest. For though he does rely on mechanical (and chemical) "Ibid., p. 162. 100 Ibid., p. 111. 101 For the reference to Descartes' ''Doctrine of the Passions of the Soul," see Willis, ibid., p. 162.

BROWN references at certain important places, most of his text, unlike Descartes' Passions of the Soul, is taken up with the detailed description of the parts, reports on human dissections, references to comparative anatomy and occa- sional allusions to vivisection experiments.10* Indeed, Willis even stops to note explicitly that comparative anatomy proves the pineal gland to be merely a gland like any other, and unable to serve the high hypothetical purposes Descartes assigned to it.103 Moreover, while Willis turned all his investigative techniques to the purpose of functional explication, he defines and derives the essential categories of function by other than mechanical means. That is, he bases the fundamental differences between voluntary and involuntary action, which play so large a role in Cerebri anatome, on generalizations from manifest behavior and on long-standing medical and physiological distinctions, rather than on newly-minted mechanical language and references. Willis therefore uses Descartes-like mechanical analogies to enhance certain meanings and to sharpen a few distinctions, but he readily acknowledges that these meanings and distinctions existed both logically and chronologically prior to the invention of the mechanical philosophy. What characterized Willis' work likewise characterized that of other Ox- ford physiologists. Robert Boyle, who clearly knew Descartes' physiological writings, employed mechanical allusions strikingly similar to Descartes' as an occasional interweave in his otherwise-inspired and directed physiologi- cal essays and investigations. As one example, Boyle pauses briefly in his Usefulness of Experimental Natural Philosophy to offer the following reflec- tions: ... if chymical experiments and mechanical contrivances were industriously and judiciously associated by a naturalist profoundly skilled in both, and would make it his business to explain the phenomena of a human body . . . divers of them [phenomena] . . . might be by artificial engines (consisting as the pattern not only of solid, but liquid and spirituous parts) not ill represented to our very senses: since a human body it self seems to be but an engine, wherein almost, if not more than almost, all the motions common to men with other animals are performed mechani- cally.104 108 For vivisection experiments, ibid., p. 152. m Ibid., p. 106: "Below the Chambers of the Optick Nerves in a common Valley which lyes between the tops of these and the Buttock-form Prominences, is placed the Pineal Glandula or Kernel in form of a Pine-apple, called also Conarium; this is not only found in Man and four-footed beasts, but Fowls and Fishes also are endued with the same. Wherefore, although from hence it may be concluded, that this is of necessary use; yet we can scarce believe this to be the seat of the Soul, or its chief Faculties to arise from it; because Animals, which seem to be almost quite destitute of Imagination, Memory, and other superior Powers of the Soul, have this Glandula or Kernel large and fair enough." m Boyle, Works, op. cit. (n. 79 above), vol. 2, pp. 75-76. See n. 106 below for one of Boyle's explicit references to Descartes.</page><page sequence="27">PHYSIOLOGY AND THE MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY 5 1 After these momentary musings, Boyle quickly returns to his detailed, largely uninterpreted reporting of anatomical and chemical experiments. Thus, like his fellow Oxonian Willis, Boyle showed a familiarity and recep- tivity to the Cartesian mechanical philosophy, but, at least in his early work, he confined his unmistakable references to the periphery instead of allowing them to enter the central core of his physiology. * * * Why this dual attitude towards the Cartesian mechanical philosophy in the physiology produced at the English universities in the 1650s and early 1660s? Several explanations are possible. First, there is the momentum of tradition and the phenomenon of historical staging. However different their work may have been in certain respects from that of their predecessors and contem- poraries, Boyle and Willis both owed something to the neoclassical tradition of medicine and physiology. Unlike Boyle, Willis had a university M.D., and this meant that he had spent several years absorbing the essential ideas and explanatory assumptions of Galen, Fernel and similar authors. But even Boyle, though not an M.D., was widely read in Galen and the neoclassical writers, as many references in his works make clear.105 Immersion in or, at least, thorough exposure to these traditions worked to assure that the mechanical philosophy would not suddenly, at its very introduction, occupy center stage in productions of men deeply conscious of prior tradition and to some extent carried along by its momentum. Secondly, Harvey's work also had a considerable influence over all four men in ques- tion, and Harvey was anything but a force pushing in the direction of the mechanical philosophy. Indeed, the more closely one studied Harvey's works and pursued his methods of comparative anatomy and vivisection, the more one tended to question the simple physiological mechanisms of Des- cartes. This was apparent in Boyle's investigations of heartbeat.108 105 See, for example, Works, vol. 2, p. 52: " . . . when he [Galen] comes to consider particularly the exquisite structure of a human body . . . [he] breaks forth into very elevated, and even pathetical celebrations of God, and tell[s] us, that in his books, De usu partium, he composed hymns to the Creator's praise." I0# See, for example, Boyle, Works, op. cit. (n. 77 above), vol. 2, p. 69. "If you dexterously take out the hearts of vipers, and of some smaller fishes, whose coldness make them beat much more unfrequently and leisurely, than those of warm animals, the contraction and relaxation of the fibres of the heart may be distinctly observed, in order to the deciding or reconciling the controversy about the cause and manner of the heart's motion, betwixt those learned modem anatomists that contend, some of them, for Dr. Harvey's opinion' and others, for that of the Cartesians. Towards satisfying my self in which difficulty, I remember, I have sometimes taken the heart of a flounder, and having cut it transversely into two parts, and pressed out, and with a linnen cloth wiped off, the blood contained in each of them, I observed, that for a considerable space of</page><page sequence="28">52 THEODORE M. BROWN A third possible explanation is that the philosophical influences affecting Boyle, Willis and others were quite complex and somewhat mixed. William Petty, for example, was a major philosophical source for the Oxonian physiologists. This former associate of Thomas Hobbes almost certainly introduced Descartes-like mechanical ideas along with his experimental and anatomical concerns. But Petty, as some recently published letters make clear, was careful to balance interest in Cartesian principles with the highest regard for experiment.107 Within physiology, enthusiasm for experiment meant central respect for anatomy and vivisection and only qualified, if nonetheless definite, interest in mechanical hypotheses. Fourthly, there may have been a political motive, whether conscious or unconscious, that contributed to the mixed attitude towards mechanism we have seen in the Oxonian physiologists. For the university scientists had to walk a narrow tightrope in order to distinguish themselves from their recent, bitter and radical critics while not appearing reactionaries themselves. As has been suggested earlier, the militant university critics of the Puritan Rev- olution had expressed unqualified and largely thoughtless support for the new ideas of Descartes and other mechanical philosophers.108 Members of the beleaguered Oxford community, by contrast, would have to express some interest in the new ideas or seem hopelessly out-of-date. Yet at the same time they could moderate heated enthusiasm with cool reflection. To endorse but simultaneously to qualify the new ideas, and by doing so to exhibit their critics as uneducated and foolish men, was the effective strategy John Wilkins and Seth Ward adopted in 1654.109 Their university time, the severed and bloodless parts held on their former contraction and relaxation. And once, I remember, that I observed, not without wonder, that the severed portions of a flounder's heart did, not only after the blood was drained, move as before, but the whole heart observed for a pretty while such a succession of motion in its divided and exsanguious pieces, as I had taken notice of in them, whilst they were coherent, and as you may with pleasure both see and feel in the intire heart of the same fish." im Charles Webster, "Henry More and Descartes," op. cit. (n. 76 above), pp. 367-369. 108 See above for general context, and for one example of "unqualified and largely thoughtless support," see John Webster, Academiarum examen (London, 1654), pp. 104-107 passim: "That the Galenical way of the medicinal part of Physick . . . may not be the prison that all men must be inchained in, and ignorance, cheating and impostorage maintained by Lawes and Charters; but that the more sure, cleer and exquisit way of finding the true causes, and certain cures of diseases, brought to light by those two most eminent and laborious persons, Paracelsus and Helmont, may be entertained, prosecuted and promoted .... The next is Metaphy sicks, to help which I shall only offer this expedient, that it might be reduced to some certain grounds and principles . . . and so that the most sure way of Renatus des Cartes may be brought into use, and exercise. 109 The Wilkins/Ward strategy is apparent in their rejoinder to Webster, Vindiciae Academiarum (Oxford, 1654). For a developed version of this "cooptation" model of university response to its 1650s critics, see my</page><page sequence="29">PHYSIOLOGY AND THE MECHANICAL PHILOSOPHY 53 colleagues and associates could then easily follow their lead in physiology, which is just what they seem to have done. They could pay homage to the mechanical philosophy, but unlike some of their critics they would not be- come its witless devotees. Finally, it is even possible that popular opinion and common theology contributed to restraining enthusiasm for mechanism within the physiology produced at the universities. The 'fifties and 'sixties were the first decades of outraged reaction to the recently published views of Thomas Hobbes.110 The author of Leviathan (1651) and De corpore (1655) was immediately casti- gated for his atheism, anticlericalism, ethical relativism and determinism. At the heart of all these intolerable views, it was believed, lay Hobbes' materialism, according to which there was no place for immortal and im- material spirits anywhere in the universe. In the body of man there were only matter and motion, for sensation, memory and thought were mere "cor- poreal motions."111 University men played a major role in responding to Hobbes. Henry More of Cambridge wrote Antidote Against Atheism (1653) and The Immortality of the Soul (1659) largely against Hobbes.112 Seth Ward of Oxford wrote A Philosophical Essay Towards an Eviction of the Being and Attributes of God (1655) and In Thomae Hobbii philosophiam (1656) likewise against Hobbes.113 Even Robert Boyle, in an essay on physical matters of 1662, An Examen of Mr. T. Hobbes his Dialogus Physicus De Natura Aeris , paused to reflect that, it might possibly prove some service to higher Truths than those in Controversie between him and me to shew that in Phy sicks themselves his Opinions, and even his Ratiocinations, have no such great advantage over those of some Orthodox Christian Naturalists.114 In this climate it is hard to imagine that other university men would thoughtlessly and unqualifiedly speak of the "corporeal motions" within human and animal machines; instead, they would have to worry about public reaction and the unintended identification of their views with Hobbesian materialism. This, no doubt, was still another reason why Willis and Boyle "The Rise of Baconianism in Seventeenth Century England," in the forthcoming Festschrift for Edward Rosen to be published by the Polish Academy of Sciences. no For an excellent general account, see Samuel I. Mintz, The Hunting of Leviathan (Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 1962). 111 Ibid., p. 63 ff. ntIbid., p. 84 ff. 113 Ibid., p. 55. 114 Quoted ibid., p. 87.</page><page sequence="30">54 THEODORE M. BROWN showed something less than unabashed support for mechanism within the animal oeconomy. Conclusion The net result of the varied and sometimes cautious reactions we have traced in the 'forties, 'fifties and early 'sixties was a multiply ambivalent incursion. Throughout the 'forties new attitudes towards physiological ex- planation generally made little headway. In the 'fifties, in the College of Physicians, Francis Glisson kept the mechanical philosophy beyond the pale. He retreated to "similary attraction" as a way of defending neoclassical physiology from the invasion of philosophical modernity. In the universities, leading students of the animal oeconomy granted a definite place to mechanism within physiology. They refused to retreat or retrench in the face of Descartes, and they either gently substituted chemical and mechanical metaphors for the old "faculties" or simply ignored the need for explicit explanation. Yet even within university physiology enthusiasm was qualified to a considerable degree, and the role of the mechanical philosophy was carefully circumscribed. But however complex, an initial reaction to mechanism within the animal oeconomy had been formulated. Over the next twenty years this initial, ambivalent reception was to change to a fuller, less qualified enthusiasm. Science and the circumstances of its practice were to alter markedly, and in these altered conditions physiol- ogy changed too. The path was cleared for full invasion, and once the terri- tory was open the mechanical philosophy would remain entrenched for at least sixty years.</page></plain_text>
