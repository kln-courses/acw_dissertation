Mumonkan, 1228) koan collection commentary. This case, which retains a brief but relatively complex narrative that contrasts with many koans known for their highly condensed or abbreviated form of expression focusing on a single phrase, word, or syllable, concerns a monk in a mountain monastery who confesses that he is really a "non- human" (C. fei-jen, J. hinin kVk). He admits that he has been transfigured into a wild fox spirit (C. yeh-hu ching, J. yako-zei ffJESl) for five hundred lifetimes as retribution for presuming that enlight- enment is beyond the otherwise inescapable effects of karmic causali- ty. The fox/monk is eventually released from the punishment when master Pai-chang ct (749-814) utters a succinct, transformative "turning word" (C. i-chuan-yii, J. ittengo -W4) that affirms the inviolability of karma, and his fox corpse is subsequently found by Pai-chang under a massive rock on the far side of the mountain and buried with clerical rites. The main or overt discursive structure, according to most tradi- tional commentaries, is a metaphysical, anti-supernatural analysis of causality that is consistent with a long-standing debate in Bud- dhist intellectual history about the relation between determination by karma, or the realm of the conditioned (samskrta), and enlighten- ment, or the unconditioned (asamskrta) realm of release from karma. In the kaan, the term wild fox is used merely as a rhetorical device indicating the unenlightenment of the ancient monk which is over- come by a correct understanding of karma. The core of the koan consists of a typical Zen "encounter dialogue" (C. chi-yuan wen-ta, J. kien-mondo ,&amp;rW), a spontaneous repartee in which a master uses sparse and often inscrutable or nonsensical words to trigger a libera- tion from conceptual fixation in his disciple. Yet, despite the koan's emphasis on strict adherence to causality, the commentaries stress a paradoxical identity of bondage and freedom, or causality and non- causality. For example, the Wu-men-kuan verse highlights an equali- zation of apparent opposites: "Not falling [into causality], not obscur- ing [causality] :/Two sides of the same coin" (the second line can also be rendered: "Two winning numbers, one roll of the dice").3 3 Wu-men-kuan no. 2, in Taisho shinshui daizjkyo ;ETX; W,, eds. Takakusu Junjir6 j%</page><page sequence="3">THE WILD FOX KOAN 259 Yet, this exchange is rather atypical because unlike the usual disci- ple the fox/monk cannot be liberated from hisfei-jen status through his own efforts alone but instead depends upon the master's recita- tion of a phrase with mysterious power. How is the appearance of the fox and the supernaturalism it evokes related to the philosophi- cal commentaries? Should it be understood as an other-worldly enti- ty or does it symbolize an interior state of mind, such as the deluded side of Pai-chang? These questions point to the fact that underlying and driving the encounter dialogue is a covert or "muted" struc- ture generally hidden from the view of, or at least not directly ad- dressed by, many commentators.4 The koan narrative bears a strik- ing morphological affinity with folklore tales in medieval China and Japan dealing with the exploits of shapeshifting, trickster foxes who seduce or possess unsuspecting victims and can only be eliminated by ritual exorcism.5 In this colloquial mythic cycle, foxes intrude on the spirits of vulnerable people or transfigure into human form often as an alluring vixen or a wayward, irregular priest either as a means of deceit or punishment or out of more compassionate motives such as providing a widower with a spouse or teaching a moral lesson. But their vulpine nature remains unseen, invisible and completely unknown to the victim who confounds illusion and reality.6 This condition persists until the true nature is identified and an exorcism based on the use of a Buddhist or other religious symbol, such as the MiktI&amp; and Watanabe Kaigyoku OMJLH.

The completion of the ritual coincides with the discovery of animals scurrying underfoot or of a dead fox shape, which signifies that the source of the delusion has been termi- nated. Many times the fox body is given a proper burial in accord with the last wishes of the human side which was tormented by being trapped in a non-human existence.7 The "fox koan" from its opening passage on the confession of the monk's identity as a fri-jen - a term (Skt. amanusya) also used in Buddhist cosmology to refer to other-than-human beings ranging from gods to beasts and demons - creates an atmosphere hospita- ble to the key supernatural elements in folklore tales which evoke phenomena known as the kuai I-, or the anomalous and unknowa- ble, and the chi *, or the strange, fantastic, or extraordinary. This kuai/chi literature features heroes and anti-heroes who are either more than human as immortals or less than human as demons or ghosts. Their animal transformations, which are referred to in Japanese as bakemono {tL, are considered part of natural reality.8 The category of non-humans who appear as or who resemble people includes spirits or fairies (C. ching, J. sei *n - this includes fox spirits), as well as ghosts (kuei 3,), goblins, demons, genii, nymphs, ogres, and evil spirits of forests and waters. Shapeshifters like the fox continually struggle with a sense of bondage due to the ever present though permeable boundaries separating the natural and su- pernatural realms. This tension is vividly expressed inJenshi chuan, perhaps the earliest and most complex T'ang tale of anthropomor- phosis that became paradigmatic for countless subsequent versions, 7 Rania Huntington notes two stories with this ending from the T'ai-p 'ing kuang-chi, "Miss Jen" and "Li Nun," in "Tigers, Foxes and the Margins of Humanity in Tang Chuanqi Fiction," Papers on Chinese Literature 1 (1993): 59. 8 On kuai/chi literature see Huntington, "Tigers, Foxes and the Margins of Humanity in Tang Chuanqi Fiction"; and Karl S.Y. Yao, Classical Chinese Tales of the Supernatural and Fantastic (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985). In Japanese, the verb bakasu (also pronounced ke or ka, C. hua) as the root of bakemono can mean "to seduce or bewitch," but it can also imply any change or metamorphosis, including the positive manifestation of a bud- dha or bodhisattva (keshin ILM). On other shapeshifting animals see Brandon Drew Hunter, One Hundred Japanese Strange Creatures (Tsukuba shob6, 1992); and Stephen Addiss, Japanese Ghosts and Demons: Art of the Supernatural (New York: George Braziller, 1985), especially p. 127 which features a print by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi.</page><page sequence="5">THE WILD FOX KOAN 261 in that the vixen who begins as a femme fatale proves more faithful and pure than her human lover, Cheng, and dies in anguish when her kuai identity is discovered. In a similar vein, a Tokugawa era drawing of the opening scene of the koan illustrates the muted struc- ture by showing a bushy foxtail, which is a typical folklore motif, peeking out from under the Buddhist robe as a giveaway of thefei- jen's identity.9 [See Figure 1.] This koan also seems to borrow structural elements found inJen- shi chuan and other fox tales in crafting a narrative that uses mythi- cal time (e.g., the five hundred lifetimes, whether counted as hu- man or vulpine) and dramatic shifts in geography or landscape (as from the monastery to the rock on the other side of the mountain) to reflect the psychological movement from ignorance and attachment to wisdom and release. Furthermore, the narrative consists of sever- al stages that are akin to the pattern of folktales. The first stage is the apparition that manifests due to karmic retribution or as an ex- pression of shame about prior wrongdoing. This stage is followed by an identification and purgation of the fei-jen status, an act of repen- tance and a burial which saves the human spirit despite a reversion of its body to animal form, and finally post-mortem contrition or il- luminating commentary by the narrator. The fox folktales are contained in numerous collections from the Six Dynasties through T'ang and Sung China, such as the Sou shen chi and T'ai-p'ing kuang-chi (parts of which are contained in the Ch'ing Liao-chai chih-i, which the compiler originally planned to title "Devil and Fox Stories"), as well as from Heian and early Kamakura Japan, including the Nihon ryJiki, Konjaku monogatari, Uji shu-i monogatari, and Kokonchomonjii.' While many of these texts in- clude non-Buddhist and secular material, they also incorporate a genre of popular Buddhist morality tale literature referred to in Japanese as setsuwa bungaku M XT-, which consists of brief didactic narratives that articulate supernatural themes about the moral effects of karmic retribution (C. yeh-pao, J. go7hoJ j) occurring 9 This is from Akizuki Ry6min #I Atk, Zen mondo: koan-e monogatari p$Mg *ItJ ii (Ch6bunsha, 1976), p. 128. 10 On the Liao-chai chih-i title, see Herbert A.

Setsuwa literature actually stems from, and the term is retroactively applied to, numerous Chinese folklore texts that have an explicitly Buddhist orientation, including the Ming-pao chi and San-pao kan-ying yao-lui lu, which were absorbed into the T'ai-p 'ing kuang-chi and other comprehensive collections in China and Japan." The setsuwa sources reflect the interaction of animistic and shamanistic mythology with several key aspects of the Buddhist worldview. These include a literal acceptance of the early Buddhist belief that human existence transmigrates through numerous lives in different fei-jen species, such as deities, angry spirits, hungry ghosts, denizens of hell, and animals; a retelling of early Buddhist Jdtaka fables about the previous incarnations of Buddha into animal forms, including foxes and jackals; and a refashioning of avddana legends of Buddhist priests subduing local deities, including the spirits of magical animals often referred to as na-ga. Because of perva- sive syncretism, it is difficult to determine precisely the origins of fox folklore, that is, the extent to which it was either primarily in- digenous or largely introduced by Buddhism. However, it is clear that karmic tales about a wide assortment of supernatural creatures first began to appear in the fourth century and by the T'ang era the fox emerged as a major anthropomorphic animal, along with snakes and tigers. 2 Fox folklore in China has tended to put a strong empha- sis on detailed instructions in sexual alchemy by which foxes learn to transfigure or attain immortal status. In Japan there has been an emphasis at least since the inception of the Inari cult in the eighth " See W. Michael Kelsey, Konjaku Monogatari-shuk (Boston: Twayne, 1982), pp. 96-97, 164 n. 19. On the relation between Zen literature and popular Buddhism, Victor H. Mair, Tun- huang Popular Narratives (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 24, points out that the Zen recorded sayings texts were among the earliest written examples of colloquial lan- guage in China, and he also has a broader discussion of the rise of written vernacular litera- ture in "Buddhism and the Rise of the Written Vernacular in East Asia: The Making of National Languages," JAS 53.3 (1994): 707-51. Many of the setsuwa are at least indirectly influenced by early Buddhist jdtakas which generally refer to jackals rather than foxes. However, in some cases the Sanskrit term is vague and indicates a four-legged hairy animal. 12 The earliest appearance is in the Sou shen chi; see Derk Bodde, "Some Chinese Tales of the Supernatural," HJAS 6 (1942): 338-57. Also, the T'ai-ping kuang-chi, which consists of 500 chuan, contains a collection of fox tales in c. nos. 447-55, but stories with foxes appear frequently in other sections as well; see Edward H. Schafer, "The Table of Contents of the T'ai p'ing kuang chi," CLEAR 2.2 (1980): 248-63.</page><page sequence="8">264 STEVEN HEINE century on the sacrality of the fox as a divine messenger as well as on a distinction between various kinds of demonism, including tsuki- mono OD 4o (foxes appearing as or possessing people) and kitsune- mochli 4 (families [accused of] fox sorcery)."3 Despite important differences in distinct historical periods and cultural constructions there are some enduring themes in the portrayal of illusion reflect- ed in many literary and artistic expressions. A prime example of this pattern is the way a glorious mansion is depicted in thoroughly realistic terms at the peak of one's bewitchment until it is exposed as "only some broken-down walls," as in Jenshi chuan, or as a hovel in a pile of weeds.14 The point of convergence is that the "fox koan" and morality tale literature both reflect a process of transforming and being trans- formed by indigenous folk religiosity. The ko-an can be read as the record of an encounter between the Buddhist philosophy of causali- ty deriving from self-realization devoid of supernaturalism and the ritual of fox spirit possession generated by divine intervention, which suggests an approach to morality based on ritual purification representing an extreme form of externalization and ceremonializa- tion that is scandalous to Zen meditative practice. Are the philosoph- ical and supernatural implications complementary or conflicting modes of discourse? Or is it the case that we must abandon the opposition between a philosophical reading and a folklore reading and, as Pierre Bourdieu suggests in a somewhat parallel context, "undertake a simultaneously. . . dual reading of writings which 13 On this distinction see Carmen Blacker, The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1975), pp. 51-68; and Yumi Morishige, "Cul- tural Construction of Foxes," M.A. thesis, Cornell University (1994).

Link, Waves and Plagues: The Art of Masami Teraoka (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1988), pp. 58-59, in which the fox symbolizes AIDS attacking a courtesan.</page><page sequence="9">THE WILD FOX KOAN 265 are defined by their fundamental ambi'uity, that is, by their reference to two social spaces, which correspond to two mental spaces." 15 Perhaps fox folklore can be considered to highlight the personal or existential rather than metaphysical implications of karmic retribu- tion in that a "human's transmogrification into beast form is clearly linked with moral lapses."1 6 As the narrator of Jenshi chuan com- ments after the fox heroine has been identified and dies, "Ah, the emotions of supernatural beings reflect the meaning of human exis- tence!" The rhythm of the appearance and disappearance of the apparition coincides with and dramatizes the inner dynamics of the arising and overcoming of delusion, thereby creating a unity of narrative form and content, or of medium and meaning. A main theme in recent studies of both Eastern and Western religion concerns the relation between magic based on colloquial spirits of the so-called little tradition and the scholasticism based on a universal theology of the great tradition that often scorns and repudiates supernaturalism. In the engagement between great and little traditions in medieval Europe, according to Aron Gurevich, "Ancient, pre-Christian magical practices did not vanish. How- ever, they existed now in an entirely new mental context. Their practitioners and participants had to become aware of the limits of magic and had to develop a critical attitude towards it. "7 The koan is an example of medieval Buddhism creating a new context for understanding supernatural beliefs which did not simply dis- appear but were transmuted by virtue of a critical, transcendental attitude at once exploiting and surpassing their original literal mean- ing. The process of syncretism is usually portrayed in terms of a two-tiered, "trickle-down" model which focuses on how the great tradition elevates the little tradition. But it is also relevant to ask the reverse question - without hierarchical ranking - of the extent to which folk religion infiltrates the great tradition. How is the mental context of philosophy affected and changed by the mutuality of as- similation? What are the benefits to the architects of scholasticism, 15 Pierre Bourdieu, The Political Ontology of Martin Heidegger, trans.

My analysis of the relation between philosophy and folk beliefs is influenced by several excellent studies of the process by which medieval Buddhism suppresses and converts, or de-encodes and re-encodes the gods and symbols of popular religiosity."8 These stu- dies demonstrate that Buddhism is not a unitary, pure, discrete and unchanging essence but consists of complex, diverse phenomena continually interacting and interpenetrating with other- and non- Buddhist theories and practices."9 Nevertheless, several of these studies tend to overlook the multiple levels of interconnectedness generating shifting alliances and digressions and thus they are not necessarily free from presupposing a hierarchical two-tiered model. In the concluding section I will critically evaluate three approaches to the relation between great and little traditions within Zen dis- course: one view emphasizes epistemological differences and incom- patibility, or an irreconcilable discursive gap; another view stresses harmonious continuity and complementarity; and a third view achieves a compromise position by highlighting a creative tension involving both reinforcement and challenge. My approach extends the compromise view by explaining the complex process of intersec- tarian and intertextual appropriation and sublimation as a key to overcoming the two-tiered model. I will be drawing on two main theorists who deal with the interac- tion between overlapping or conflicting discourses: Roland Barthes, who examines the polysemy or multiple meanings of a single sign or symbol that enables it to function in two distinct but interacting rhe- torical systems; and Pierre Bourdieu, who argues that a discursive context is based on and invariably references back to a more general 18 Valerie Hansen, "Gods on Walls: A Case of Indian Influence on Chinese Lay Religion?", in Religion and Society in T'ang and Sung China, eds. Patricia Buckley Ebrey and Peter N.

Bourdieu refers to the undiscussed as a homological "field of opinion, the locus of the con- frontation of competing discourses," or as a "doxa" encompassing the polarity of orthodoxy and heterodoxy, the sum total of the theses tacitly posited on both sides of an inquiry which is simply taken for granted by all parties and thus often not articulated.20 The polysemy of the term "wild fox spirit" is used on diverse, dis- persed levels reflecting the dialectical tensions between the interlock- ing rhetorical perspectives of the mythological/supernatural and the philosophical/anti-supernatural. These perspectives, while at times competing, also depend upon and reinforce one another in con- tinually referencing back to fox imagery as a doxic field suggesting il- lusion, self-deception, or a dream-like liminal realm in which the contours and boundaries of reality are called into question. The Zen koan literary tradition seeking to establish its hegemony over local folk traditions, as well as its credentials as a rational ideology in a Neo-Confucian environment in Sung China, on one level selective- ly assimilates while at the same time actively dispels and displaces the pattern of fox possession lore. Yet, we must recognize that the philosophy of causality absorbs and is transformed by the super- naturalism it rejects in the very act of disdaining it. The relation is characterized by a homological dimension of convergence and com- plementarity in that both discourses highlight the problematics of de- lusion and the dynamics of attaining freedom. But it is also charac- terized by a heterological dimension - a notion relatively lacking in Bourdieu's theory of doxa but supported by Barthes' view of poly- semy - of encounter and mutual subversion in that the philosophi- cal view stresses an internal, subjective realization based on intellec- tual understanding and the folklore view emphasizes the external mechanics of exorcism.

Hyakujo goroku), and the somewhat longer Pai-chang kuang-lu (J. Hyakujo ko-roku), the extant manuscripts of which - as is the case with nearly all records of T'ang masters - date from the twelfth cen- tury or later.23 The dialogue is also included in transmission of the lamp histories such as the Tsung-men teng-yao chi (J.

Both the Ku-tsun-suyi-yao and the Ssu-chia yu-lu, particularly the latter, are highly problematic in terms of verifying the date and authenticity of the materials; see Yanagida Seizan's NJEI1MLl discussion of the develop- ment of these texts in relation to other Zen records in "Goroku no rekishi OiOF, " Toho gakuho 57 (1985): 537-48. Two main points are: (1) the records of Pai-chang, as well as those of numerous other prominent T'ang masters, were probably created as independent texts not before but some time subsequent to the Sung era transmission of the lamp histories through a process of culling and editing from these rather voluminous texts; and (2) the notion of the in- tegrity of the school of four masters or "four houses" (C. ssu-chia, J. shike) who represented the so-called Ma-tsu-style teachings was an even later stage of development in the tradition.

Pai-chang. One day after everyone has departed he stays behind and informs the master of the monastery that he is a non-human suffering five hundred fox transmigrations.25 Long ago, as a master of the same temple in a previous lifetime in the age of Kasyapa, the penultimate (and final prehistoric) of the seven primordial buddhas culminating in Sakyamuni, he denied the basic Buddhist doctrine of the inviolability of cause-and-effect. When asked if even a person of great cultivation (ta-hsiu-hsing, continuous practice after enlighten- ment) is subject to causality, he had answered that there is "no fall- ing into (or bondage to) causality" (C. pu-lo yin-kuo, J. furaku inga T X1N:). The fox/man, referred to in some commentaries as the "former Pai-chang, " beseeches the current master, renowned in Zen lore as a strict disciplinarian, to offer a turning word to release him from the retribution of perpetual transfiguration. Turning words are abbreviated linguistic devices often used in Zen dialogues to create an unmediated psycho-ontological revolution in a dis- ciple's perspective which suddenly and intuitively liberates him 24 It is also important to note collections in which the koan is not cited, including transmis- sion of the lamp texts such as the Tsu-t'ang chi (J. SodoYshuz) and Ching-te chuan-teng lu, despite the fact that these texts offer the earliest biographies of Pai-chang and both useyeh-hu ching as a term of derision, in addition to koan collections such as the Hsueh-tou po-tse sung-ku (J. Setcho hyakusoku juko), and Pi-yen lu (though the compiler Yuan-wu does include it in his own recorded sayings). 25 This recalls a story in the early Vinaya in which a naga (snake) shifts into human form and tries to pass itself off as a monk only to be discovered when it falls asleep, leading to the creation of rules against allowing non-humans into the monastic community, in The Vinaya pitakam, ed. Hermann Oldenberg (London: Williams and Norgate, 1879), I:86-87, as cited in John S. Strong, ed., The Experience of Buddhism: Sources and Interpretations (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 1994), pp. 60-61.

The current Pai-chang responds by pronouncing an affirmation of cause-and-effect: there is no one who "does not obscure (or remain subject to) causality" (pu-meiyin-kuo). The former Pai-chang, on hearing that there is no escape from kar- ma, is thus liberated from his karmic punishment by the current Pai-chang. Now enlightened the old man dies and his fox body discovered un- der the rock is properly cremated and buried, according to his last request, with a priest's funeral. [See Figure 2.] The ceremony at first confuses the other monks because no one had been sick in the infirmary and only Pai-chang had been aware of the non-human's existence. This indicates how important clerical burial rites had become in Sung monastic codes and institutional life.26 In an epi- logue to the main narrative - another literary device apparently borrowed from folktales - later that night, on hearing Pai-chang's public explanation of the episode, his disciple Huang-po V (d. 850) irreverently asks what would have happened to the old monk if he had answered the question about causality correctly when first asked. (Huang-po later became known for his rough handling of his own famous disciple Lin-chi &amp;M, J. Rinzai.) Challenged by the master to step forward before the entire congregation, Huang-po proceeds to slap Pai-chang, who claps and approvingly exclaims, "I thought the barbarian had a red beard [symbolic of Bodhidharma who brought Zen from the west], but here is another red-bearded barbarian!" that is, a master enlightened in the manner of the first patriarch in China. The "fox koan" plays a crucial role in both Rinzai and Soto Zen interpretive traditions. The case is contained in one of the main texts used in Rinzai training (Katto shuA, no. 37), and in Hakuin's Tokugawa era system it is considered a nanto A koan, or case that is "difficult to pass through" but has the potential to enhance "postenlightenment cultivation" or "realization beyond realiza- tion" (shjtaichozyo Xi ).27 It also serves as the basis of two of the 26 The guidelines for ritual burial of monks are in the earliest extant monastic code, Ch 'an- yuan ch'ing-kuei (J.

It is particularly noteworthy that Dogen's fascicles, written at different stages in his career, have received in- creasing attention in recent Shobogenzo studies because they offer nearly opposite interpretations of the source case.29 "Daishugyo," the earlier fascicle, supports an equalization of karmic transmigra- tion and the transcendence of karma in accord with standard Sung commentaries. "Because causality necessarily means full cause and complete effect," Dogen writes, "there is no reason for a discussion concerning 'falling into' or 'not falling into, ' 'obscuring' or 'not obscur- ing' [causality]. If 'not falling into causality' is incorrect, then 'not obscuring causality' is also incorrect."30 But "Jinshin inga," com- posed ten years later near the end of Dogen's life, rejects the iden- tification with transcendence and asserts the inexorability of the karmic process. It refers to the paradoxical view as the "greatest mistake in Sung China" resulting in a non-Buddhistic denial of causality (hanmu inga I*1NT*).31 28 According to the standard edition of the Shobogenzo-, Dogen's citation is based on the T'ien-sheng kuang-teng lu version (1036), but Ishii Shuido t;H#Ji1 argues that the real source is the Tsung-men teng-yao lu (1133).

The main debate is between a strictly literal reading of the case as an affirmation of cau- sality and denial of non-causality, which is suggested in Dogen's Shobogenzo "Jinshin inga" fascicle, versus a paradoxical reading that maintains the identity or the nonduality of opposites, which is articulated in the Wu-men-kuan and most other commentaries includ- ing the "Daishugyo" fascicle. According to the main philosophical approach, an understanding of the paradox is sufficient for release from transmigration and the attainment of enlightenment. Thefei- jen motif functions primarily as a one-dimensional literary device or metaphorical substitute for the delusion of the ancient monk, sug- gesting that eliminating the fox-as-unenlightenment results in the attainment of nirvadna.32 Such an image is stripped of animistic over- tones and actually functions as part of a critique of supernaturalism. This accords with the standard meaning in Zen texts of the terms "wild fox" (C. yeh-hu, J. yako or nogitsune ffJ), which literally means a "(roaming) field fox" considered the lowliest of the numerous species implying a state beyond sanctions or control, and "wild fox spirit," which refers to an apparition or ghost that strad- dles the borderline between human and non-human, or mainstream and marginal status. These terms are primarily intended as a scath- ing critique of a rogue, counterfeit element in those who misportray authentic teachings while attempting to deceive others into thinking they have attained a genuine realization. The terms are "critical of those who indulge in cleverness or try to claim personal liberty by repudiating cause and effect in their actions."33 32 In an interesting transcultural example, literary critic Jonathan Culler, in his explana- tion of the function of metaphors, cites the term "fox as the metaphorical substitute for a liter- al formulation such as 'devious, crafty, creature,"' in The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 204. 33 Thomas Cleary, trans., Sayings and Doings of Pai-chang (Los Angeles: Center Publica- tions, 1978), p. 95 n.22.

In a caricature of Buddhist clericism and worship created by Buddhist priests, recalling the European Reynard, in monochrome scrolls</page><page sequence="18">274 STEVEN HEINE A passage in the Platform Siutra is indicative of the Zen rhetorical strategy of using the symbolic meaning of supernaturalism: "The poisoned mind is an evil dragon . . . delusions are supernatural de- mons, the three poisons are hell."34 The images are offered in a straightforward, unambiguous way to reflect essentially negative states of mind metaphorically projected onto external realms. Just prior to this sentence, the passage uses positive images in an inverse way by equating four buddhas with the virtues of compassion, joy- ful giving, purity, and equanimity. In similar fashion, Lin-chi and Dogen repeatedly employ the epithet "wild fox" to refute incorrect teachings associated with illu- sion and heresy. The locus classicus for this is no doubt the Lin-chi lu 1.M (J. Rinzai roku), in which the term appears five times, all in a thoroughly derisive way. Lin-chi is also known for an unsparing con- demnation of supernatural practices such as visions and prophecies associated with Manijusri worship at the Mt. Wu-t'ai-shan cultic center.35 In a devastating criticism that echoes Confucian scholar Hsiun-tzu's sharp contrast between the common folk who em- brace ceremonies based on superstition and the refined chiin-tzu who practice rituals because of their elegant ceremonial quality, Lin-chi declares: And then there're a bunch of shavepates who, not knowing good from bad, point to the east and point to the west, delight in fair weather, delight in rain, and delight in lanterns and pillars.... Lacking understanding, students become infatuated with them. Such [shavepates] as these are all wild fox spirits and nature goblins. Good students snicker, "Tee-hee!" and say, "Blind old shavepates, deluding and be- witching everyone under heaven!"36 in the Chojui giga collection, foxes and other animals in the form of priests strike poses that seem either mortified or overly pious as they worship Buddha in the form of a frog against a withered, leafless background; see Joan Stanley Baker, Japanese Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 1988), pp. 88-89. 3 Philip B.

Yet when you hold your bowl and eat your food, the food is not your self.' A monk asked: How about when the food is my self?' The Master cried: You wild fox ghost! Country bumpkin!' "37 Also, in the Pi-yen lu 000 (J. Hekiganroku) koan collection case no. 93, Ta Kuang is asked about the meaning of another master's utterance and he responds by dancing and the disciple bows. When Ta Kuang queries the disciple about whether this gesture reflects a genuine un- derstanding, the monk dances in a way that apparently imitates his action without insight and Ta-kuang admonishes, "You wild fox spirit! " In his commentary on the exchange, Yiian-wu refers to Ta- kuang's "kindness" in using the term as a turning word to "trans- mute the monk's discriminating consciousness."38 Another term often used in the same way is "wild fox drool or slaver" (C. yeh-hu hsien, J. yako-zen f V1), which refers to those who rabidly mimic the words or gestures of their teachers. For example, in commenting on the koan passage "The old man on hearing this [turning] word had a great enlightenment," the Ts'ung-jung lu compiler Wan-sung writes sardonically, "But he still has fox drool!"39 On one level of discourse reflecting a profound skepticism and scorn of ritual practice, fox imagery, despite a rhetorical indebted- ness to folklore, is used in Zen writings explicitly in order to refute and suppress any belief in supernatural or superstitious religiosity. However, in contrast to the one-dimensionality of the metaphor in some of the above examples, many of the medieval commentaries neither reject the magical nature of foxes nor overtly affirm it, but they comment frequently in an indirect and playfully ironic way on this and other aspects of supernatural beliefs. In the Ts'ung-jung lu, for example: "Not falling into causality is a standpoint of denial. Not obscuring causality is to go with the flow. Those who under- stand the teaching of the vehicles even slightly can see this clearly, 3 Urs App, ed. and trans., Master Yunmen: From the Record of the Chan Master "Gate of the Clouds" (New York: Kodansha, 1994), p. 159. 38 Pi-yen lu no. 93, T48:217a-b. Also, in no. 35 (T48:173c), Wu Cho tells Mafijuril with a sense of pride that the congregations in his area have three hundred or five hundred mem- bers, and Yiian-wu's note dismisses them: "They're all nothing but wild fox spirits." A similar remark is in Wu-men-kuan no. 12, T 48:294c. 39 Ts'ung-jung lu, T 48:232a.</page><page sequence="20">276 STEVEN HEINE but even though they have shed their hairy [fox] hide they still have fishy skin. " The same text also comments that Pai-chang and Huang-po "roam fearlessly like kings of the jungle, so they can certainly live in a foxhole."40 It is possible that the authors of the medieval commentaries felt they had no need to explain - though they could evoke indirectly - a doxic background their readers al- ready understood or presupposed without need for discussion. A key to clarifying how anti-supernaturalism using kuai imagery is inseparable from the discourse it critiques is the polysemy of the basic semiotic building block, the symbol of the "wild fox. " Accord- ing to Roland Barthes, two divergent or even contradictory discur- sive structures are often linked by a common sign. A sign that has been constructed out of an alliance of signifier and signified in one structure then becomes a signifier contributing to the construction of a sign on another level or in a different discursive system.4" Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney stresses that within a single polysemous sign the main or overt structure and the muted or inverted structure, which harbors latent meanings, are simultaneously present and mutually dependent, causing an entire text or a ritual performance to be multivocal and ambivalent. "Symbols, including linguistic ones," Ohnuki-Tierney writes, "are rarely univocal. As a signifier, a poly- semic symbol can take on additional meanings; in fact, it always has more than one meaning. Polysemic symbols therefore embody an inherent mechanism to overcome the basic contradiction be- tween the signifier (form) and the signified (meaning). "42 Because of the polysemy of "wild fox Zen" reflecting an ambivalent, duplici- tous attitude - or perhaps a deliberately crafted bivalency - the main structure and the muted structure of the k6an are each a reser- voir containing the full range of meaning of the opposite side with which it is often conflated or even camouflaged. One level of polysemy within philosophical discourse is that, by an inversionary method in which insults such as "bed-wetting devil" or "red-bearded barbarian" become expressions of praise, "wild fox" can function as a symbol of wisdom or detachment.

In the Pi-yen lu case no. 1, Bodhidharma crosses the Yangtze River after telling the emperor, in the epitome of Zen iconoclasm, that the Dharma contains "nothing sacred" and that he "does not know [his own name]." Yiian-wu comments: "This wild fox spirit! He cannot avoid embarrassment. He crosses from west to east and back from east to west."44 Another example is Hakuin's fascicle ti- tled " Licking Up Hsi-Keng' s Fox Drool, " which expresses nothing but praise and admiration for one of his illustrious predecessors. Translator Norman Waddell explains that fox drool or slobber is "a metaphor for a lethal poison; it can work miraculous cures by purg- ing students of their mental illness and leading them to true enlight- enment."45 An interesting twist in the Ts'ung-jung lu commentary derives from a word association found in a variety of sources based on the homophone between fox and barbarian M, which are pronounced hu in Chinese or ko in Japanese and which are both used to stigmatize marginal persons. This text rewrites the conclud- ing sentence of the koan as "I thought foxes were red-bearded, but here is another red-bearded fox. " These examples of polysemy, including those which use the terms wild fox and fox drool in a positive way, still function within the con- text of anti-supernaturalism. Yet, this kind of extreme demythologi- zation and anti-syncretism, which evokes the image of the fox so as to defeat a belief in spirits, should be interpreted in terms of the 43 Gimello, "Chang Shang-ying on Wu-tai Shan," p. 122. 44 Pi-yen lu, no. 1, T 48:140a. Other examples of this kind of inversion are in Kagamishi- ma, ed., Tendo nyojo zenji no kenkyui i V4JDjft (Shunjusha, 1983), pp. 166-67, in which the fox implies Sakyamuni; Pi-yen lu, no. 93, cited above, which uses the term in both negative (main case, "Ta Kuang Dances") and positive senses (concluding prose commen- tary); and D6gen's 75-fascicle Shobogenzo "Raihaitokuzui," SH I:318, which endorses fox and other animistic worship that is generally refuted in the 12-fascicle text "Kie-bupp6s6bo," SH II:418. 45 Norman Waddell, trans., The Essential Teachings ofZen Master Hakuin (Boston: Shambala, 1994), 115 n. 3.

Despite Lin-chi's refutation of supernatural be- liefs, historical evidence suggests that Zen monks rarely actually for- bade or rejected folkore-oriented ritual practices. On the contrary, there are numerous accounts of Zen masters in China and Japan who were said to have exorcised fox demons (or handled snakes, worsted tigers, or subdued earth-deities or some other supernatural force). Even today Buddhist temples, especially Japanese Zen mon- asteries, usually include a fox shrine (or icon of some other local animistic deity) representing an indigenous manifestation (gongen MM) of the universal Buddha-nature enshrined in a main Buddhist object of worship (honzon *t) at which monks routinely pray for the protection and prosperity of their institution. The positive and negative uses of the term wild fox in a philosophical context are mirrored by a bivalency in folklore images of the fox as both good and evil. The fox as a trickster figure like other shapeshifting animals, particularly snakes, is an ambiguous symbol and may in some myths represent fertility or productive spiritual power, as in the Japanese Inari cult for which kitsune is the messenger of the rice god, instead of an invasive force.47 "Wild fox" seems to reflect a remarkable profusion of examples of a twofold process of syncretism and stigmatization in the relation between Buddhism and indigenous traditions. This twofoldness is perhaps best reflected in twin legends about Kufkai, who is said to have sup- ported the origin of the main Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto and 46 According to Ts'ung-jung lu no. 10 (T 48:233c), there is a continuum of spiritual power linking ghosts and buddhas: "Demons and ghosts become spirits through the power of be- witchment; spells and medicines become spirits through the power of causing [effects]; heavenly beings and dragons become spirits through the power of retribution; the wise and sagely become spirits through supranormal powers; buddhas and patriarchs become spirits through the power of the Way." 47 Karen Smyers points out differences between foxes, who perform clever tricks (as in the case of the European Reynard cycle), and the classical motif of "tricksters" who are creator deities in Native American and other forms of mythology, in "The Fox and the Jewel: A Study of Shared and Private Meanings in Inari Worship, " Ph.D. diss., Princeton University (1993), p. 252 n.97.</page><page sequence="23">THE WILD FOX KOAN 279 used the wood from the trees on Inari mountain to build T-ji tem- ple, but is also reported to have expelled all foxes from his home ter- ritory on Shikoku island because a fox once interfered with his pray- ers.48 Here, the fox represents the dual possibilities of protection and deception, redemption and betrayal. Foxes, especially in Japan and to a lesser extent also in China, are deified and enshrined as protectors or divine messengers as well as demonized as deceivers.49 On the positive side, for example, the Inari/fox pantheon is often constructively assimilated with Bud- dhist and Zen deities and shrines, almost to the point of an indistinguishability between sects contributing to the shinbutsu shulgod P{VA' tradition.5" But a prominent theme in the fox (and snake) myths is the opposition set up between universal Buddhist institu- tions which have the capacity to perform an exorcism and the collo- quial non-Buddhist cult that utilizes the spirit's ability of transfigu- ration in order to bewitch and betray its victims. Buddhist exorcism is based on ritual gesture or utterance or on the administering of the precepts as performed by a variety of cult figures. These include Amida and Kannon devotees, Vinaya masters, and Nichiren priests, in addition to Zen masters, who have often been in compe- tition with non-Buddhist practitioners, such as yin/yang wizards andyamabushi ascetics as well as in modern times with New Religion 48 The first anecdote appears in Karen Smyers, "Of Foxes, Buddhas, and Shinto Kami: The Syncretic Nature of Inari Beliefs, " Japanese Religions 16.3 (1991): 62-64. Smyers empha- sizes that tracing the historical chronology suggests the fictional nature of the story, but also points out that the Inari tradition considers that Kufkai on his deathbed named the original Buddhist form (honji **P), Madarajin, that is made up of Benzaiten, Sh6ten, and Dakini- ten, which has Inari-fox as its manifestation (suijaku A). The story of Kufkai and Shikoku is reported in Juliet Piggott, Japanese Mythology (New York: Peter Bedrick, 1969, rpt. 1982), p. 48. 49 Japan tends to see the fox in more positive ways than most other cultures, and D.C. Buchanan speculates that Japanese foxes were invariably good until Chinese influences brought the notion of demonic qualities, in "Inari: Its Origin, Development, and Nature," TASJ 12 (1935): 137. However, this is contradicted by evidence of fox worship in early China; see Sawada Mizuho E3lf,, Chuigoku dobutsu dan r IJ:Vj2jX (K6bund6, 1978), pp. 172-73. 50 On the remarkable degree of syncretistic temples and deities see Gorai Shigeru A*, ed., Inari shinko no kenkyui , (Sanin shinbunsha, 1985), pp. 75-170 (on Bud- dhist sects generally) and pp. 541-638 (on Zen, especially S6t6 temples).

On the one hand, there is the famous case of fox exorcism practiced by Genna Shinsha fiA,C,M, a disciple of Gasan J6seki, the fourth descendant of Keizan (who founded Yokoji temple based on a prophetic dream of a white fox and also en- shrined Inari there) and the abbot of Sojiji temple whose followers are credited with the tremendous regional expansion of medieval Soto. In 1389 Genno is said to have exorcised one of the most demonic of foxes, the infamous "nine-tailed fox" that was original- ly expelled from India and that yin/yang master Abe no Yasunari, featured in numerous setsuwa tales, had dealt with until it took pos- session of a "killing stone" (sessholseki MIE) from which it was mur- dering people. The fox spirit dwelling in this stone, apparently a vol- canic rock emitting poisonous gases, was confronted and converted by Genno's use of a purification stick and his chant based on one of Dogen's best-known phrases, "genjJkoan l is the great mat- ter."52 On the other hand, the fox cult is fully syncretized in the S6t6 sub-sect of the Toyokawa Inari shrine which occupies the same compound as the Zen temple at Myogonji temple in Aichi prefec- ture and subsidiary temples throughoutJapan. These shrine-temple 51 In addition to the sources cited in fn. 12, see Winston Davis, Dojo: Magic and Exorcism in Modern Japan (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1980), pp. 115-60; Naoe Hiroji 4&amp;iA, ed., Inari shinko it-' j{J14 (Yuizankaku shuppan, 1983), pp. 287-93; and Kond6 Yoshiro j)* 1MC Inari shinko aRhij{A{J (Hanawa shobo, 1978), pp. 176-78.

S6t6 syncretism with fox mythology is also indicated by the hagiographical tradition that Keizan was guided to the site for founding Y6k6ji temple in Noto peninsula by the messenger of the local god in the form of a white fox; see Faure, Chan Insights and Oversights: An Epistemological Critique of the Chan Tradi- tion (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 166 n.27.</page><page sequence="25">THE WILD FOX KOAN 281 complexes which are under the jurisdiction of the main temple at Eiheiji worship the fox on several levels of a pervasive network of sacred associations: the white fox who carries the goddess Dakini- shinten is venerated and is also protected by Inari fox icons which are enshrined in the adjacent shrine hall (honden *Jn); in addition, Dakini is also assigned as the main deity (honzon) of Inari conceived as its avatar (gongen). This provides further evidence of an ambiva- lence in Soto Zen that is expressed on another level in Dogen's con- tradictory readings of the koan and views on animism. These examples of polysemy clearly derive their rhetorical force and practical flavor in conveying delusion and bewitchment from kuai (or chi or bakemono) imagery. The main meaning that emerges from the folklore constructions is that the fox as a creature poised seductively in the twilight represents a crossing of permeable bound- aries, a doorway into a realm of liminality, or a "thin veil between worlds" (of sacred and secular, or an animistic realm populated by other-worldly beings and the mundane, materialistic realm of objec- tified entities).53 For example, in Japanese lore the "fox wedding" (kitsune-yomeiri VJ2k, sometimes accompanied by a fox-fire, kitsune- bi V!k), a forbidden sight, is said to take place when the sun shines in the midst of rain, or when yin meets yang or clarity intermingles with obscurity. The fox, a nocturnal, infernal, and undomesticated loner which lives on the fringe of human society, is often portrayed as possessing an elusive allure that appeals to lonely people who are craving love or companionship or are dimly aware yet deeply dis- turbed by their frailties, foibles, and vulnerabilities. But the relation- ship cannot be fulfilled in part because of the discomfort of the vixen trying to live in the phenomenal world who, like Miss Jen, may want to be a good wife or mother. In the liminal realm between worlds, the conventional distinctions between reality and illusion, Buddha and Mara, freedom and bondage, life and death, and puri- ty and defilement are mixed and merged in confounding ways that must be confronted as a "gateless gate" (C. wu-men-kuan, J. 53 Smyers, "The Fox and theJewel," pp. 247-60; James Melville, A Haikufor Hanae (New York: Ballantine, 1989), p. 135; and Yao, Classical Chinese Tales, p. 8. As Archilochus says, "The fox knows many things," and the second part of the sentence is that "the hedgehog knows one big thing"; see Isaiah Berlin, The Fox and the Hedgehog: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History (Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 1978), p. 3.</page><page sequence="26">282 STEVEN HEINE mumonkan) to attain salvation. This is why the narrator of Jenshi chuan advises that, unlike the hapless Cheng "who only admired the vixen's beauty but was too insensitive to appreciate her charac- ter," one "should investigate the principle of transformation and view the limits of spirits and humans."54 The appearance of the fox is associated with the onset of a moral crisis and its vanquishing or disappearance represents the removal of delusion. In folklore, shame about one's failings is the driving force generating the psychological mechanisms of displacement and projection. "In the Chinese tradition a change of form, whether from human to animal or . . . animal to human, is not an external circumstance," Rania Huntington notes. "It is the result of inter- nal causes: flaws of character or behavior in the case of transforma- tions of human into beast, and determination and self-cultivation in the case of beast into human. "55 The arising and desistence of the ap- parition suggests a bivalent process of overcoming illusion by means of the illusory phenomenon of the fox, whether it is considered more or less real than human existence. The next two sections examine the relation between two para- digms of wild fox imagery intersecting in the koan: the philosophical paradigm of paradoxicality and anti-supernaturalism, and the folk religious paradigm of the twofold symbolism of the supernatural. PHILOSOPHICAL PARADIGM OF PARADOXICALITY The koan narrative falls into two parts: the tale of fox possession containing the exchange about causality between the former and current Pai-chang, followed by the demonstrative encounter in which Huang-po challenges his master's pronouncement. A philo- sophical interpretation emphasizes several interconnected levels of paradoxicality which can be categorized as the textual level, or what is explicitly stated in the case record, especially in the first part, and 5 In Traditional Chinese Stories, eds. Ma and Lau, p. 345 (translation altered); see also Huntington, "Tigers, Foxes and the Margins of Humanity in Tang Chuanqi Fiction," p. 40.

The textual paradox is that, in verbally denying causality, the old monk is victimized by karma and must endlessly suffer its effects, yet in Pai-chang's affirming the impact of causality the monk finally gains release. That is, the conceptual negation of bondage to cause-and-effect results in its perpetuation, and the affirmation results in freedom. The literal meaning of the koan, in contrast to most cases which are deliberately open-ended, quixotic, or even absurd, seems quite clear and beyond contest or interpretation in its strict denial of non- causality and assertion of causality as the only principle holding sway prior, during, and subsequent to enlightenment. This view seems consistent with the basic Buddhist doctrine of the universality of cause-and-effect and also helps eliminate any antinomian implica- tion in the equalization of transcendence and delusion which may result in an unintended sanctification of defilement. Furthermore, the narrative in which Pai-chang emerges as a savior because of his assertion of the inviolability of karma has a resonance with his repu- tation as a stern moralist and no-nonsense disciplinarian who initiat- ed Zen institutional life as a discipline distinct from other sects. Pai- chang's reputation is expressed in his (no doubt apocryphal) pronouncement, "A day without work is a day without food," as well as in his refusal to benefit from tax relief for monasteries or to beg from poor layfolk. It is also exemplified in his formulation of the first Zen monastic code, the Ch'an-men kuei-shih l rA (J. Zenmon kishiki, although the authorship and dating of this text has also been cal,ed into question in recent studies).56 However, a literal reading continues to leave open the central question of what happens in the context of a thoroughgoing affirma- tion of causality to the status of non-causality that is traditionally as- sociated with the attainment of enlightenment. Once released by the turning word, is the former Pai-chang still subject to cause-and- effect or does he attain full nirva-na?

In the "Daishugy6" fascicle, D6gen suggests that a fox spirit might have deceived Pai-chang into believing it was really a monk and therefore the fox corpse should not have received a Bud- dhist burial. This comment, echoed centuries later by Hakuin, shows how seriously the propriety of funeral ceremonialism was taken in medieval and early modern Zen, and represents at least a recognition of supernatural beliefs even while repudiating them.57 Yet, D6gen also warns against an acceptance of the mythical ele- ments in the narrative. In a bit of ironic polemic, he points out that if the former Pai-chang "was transfigured into a wild fox body [five hundred times] by virtue of karmic causality based on his incorrect answer to the disciple's question, then in more recent times Lin-chi, Te-shan, and many other Zen masters [D6gen is wont to criticize] would have suffered through hundreds of thousands of wild fox re- births. "58 The main philosophical problem is that the clear-cut conclusion emphasizing an either/or style of thinking in the first division does not convey the real significance of the koan or its complete view of causality. The textual level seems - paradoxically - rather unpara- doxical because one standpoint is asserted to the exclusion of the op- posite standpoint. In order to avoid a reductio ad absurdum on this is- sue, the main focus in the vast majority of traditional commentaries is to reverse the strict assertion of cause-and-effect by highlighting the provisionality and ultimately the indistinguishability or nondual- ity of the not-falling and not-obscuring responses. In addition to the passages from the Wu-men-kuan and "Daishugy6" previously cited, Hung-chih writes, "To talk about not falling into or not obscuring causality/ Is to remain captive to the discriminating mind."5 Fol- lowing this approach the commentary in the Ts'ung-jung lu main- tains, " 'Not falling, not obscuring,' it is just a matter of words,/ 57 Robert Aitken, The Gateless Barrier: The Wu-men-kuan (Mumonkan) (San Francisco: North Point Press, 1990), p. 25. 58 SH II:232. Thus D6gen refutes supernaturalism on ritual and transmissional or lineal grounds, and in other passages he also critiques it on the grounds of epistemology (a fox is not aware of its lifetimes) and ontology (there can be no underlying identity of human existences or shapes). 59 As cited in D6gen's "Jinshin inga" fascicle, SH II:435-37.</page><page sequence="29">THE WILD FOX KOAN 285 Too stubborn to stop drooling. "" Also according to a Sung era verse commentary:6" Not falling, not obscuring: It is a question of interpretation; If you can solve the puzzle, Then there is no longer any hitch. In addition, a natural image in Kai-feng's verse commentary on the k6an, "Pai-chang lifted the autumn moon all the way up over the peak," seems to show "how the ultimate freedom and enlighten- ment of Zen transcends rigidly divisive either/or thinking in terms of yes and no. '62 Furthermore, modern translator and commentator K6un Yamada argues for the priority of the perspective of non- duality, which he refers to as an "essential nature," thus stressing the equalization of realms which at once encompasses and under- cuts the literal perspective emphasizing their separation: "The phenomenal changes were from man to fox and from fox to man, but there is no change in the essential nature. . . . Zen always treats things from the aspect of this essential nature. Therefore every k6an should be approached in this way. '"63 The link between the textual and contextual levels is based on Pai-chang's liberating turning word at the climax of the first divi- sion and on Huang-po's irreverent slap as the key to the second divi- sion. The turning word is a linguistic device which navigates the fragile border between the use of words and no-words, or what is known in Zen as "dead words," which are discriminative and thus ineffective, and "live words," which are nondiscriminative and have the ability to affect profoundly the listener. The turning word, "which reveals the speaker's degree of insight or which transforms the listener's mind at a crucial psychological moment," is referred 60 T 48:232a; and Yasutani Hakuun 26 t, ed., Shoyoroku (Shunjuisha, 1973), p. 46.

Even though not obscuring causality appears to be the incon- testable conclusion of the koan's first part, that is not necessarily the intention of the turning word, which does not express one and only one absolute truth but functions as a provisional, pedagogical tool apropos to the moment and subject to multiple, often contradictory, interpretations. Also, in contrast to elaborate discussions about metaphysical implications, the koan can be reduced to a single word, "not obscuring," which captures the full meaning of the case, as in a famous calligraphy by Jiun.66 In addition, the concluding dialogue between Pai-chang and Huang-po suggests a contextual approach to the paradoxical nature of causality. Huang-po's challenging question and exaggerated gesture - a demonstrative style also associated with his disciple Lin-chi (" shouts") as well as Te-shan ("thirty blows of the stick! ") imply that there is no accurate or even relevant understanding or ex- pression of the issue. Since all answers are arbitrary and empty of conclusive meaning causality is ineffable. In "Daishugyo," Dogen takes the contextual paradoxical approach a step further by asking why Huang-po even referred to not-falling as "incorrect," since not-falling and not-obscuring are neither correct nor incorrect. Both answers, Dogen argues, must be understood in terms of their fitting- ness for the eras in which they were uttered. "Although not obscur- ing causality' released the wild fox body in the current age of Bud- dha Sakyamuni," he maintains, "it may not have been effective in 64 Sasaki, The Recorded Sayings of Ch 'an Master Lin-chi, p. 82 n. 174.

These questions delving into the realm of the supernatural are not dealt with directly by the medieval com- mentaries, which generally are silent about taking a stance on belief or disbelief or about persuading other monks on this topic. Rather, the commentaries are concerned with a rhetorical use of the fox im- age in order to steer free of any attachment to one or another aspect of conceptual polarity. Their use of supernatural imagery is consis- tently ironic, as suggested by Daito Kokushi's view that even the words delusion and enlightenment are nonsensical: " 'Delusion,' 'en- lightenment' - /just fox-words fooling/ Zen monks everywhere.'68 The koan commentaries' aim is to equalize opposites fully and flexibly by maneuvering through each side of the equation without attachment or bias from the standpoint of trans-causality beyond dichotomization. According to Zenkei Shibayama's modern com- mentary on the Wu-men-kuan: "When 'not falling' and 'not ignoring' [or 'not obscuring'] are both transcended and wiped away, you can for the first time yourself . . . get hold of the real significance of this koan. . . . What I want you to know is that Zen is alive and active in quite another sphere where it makes free use of both 'not falling' and 'not ignoring.' ' 69 The commentaries avoid endorsing a naive or reductionist sense of oneness so that multiplicity is eclipsed by the freedom to shift stances in a provisional fashion that continually overcomes limitations caused by fixed habits of the mind. Thus it may be misleading to compare the traditional commentaries to the modern logical formulation of Nishida Kitaro's notion of zettai mujunteki jiko doitsu f 9M-t)FiSEM (absolute contradictory self- identity) which equates all opposites.70 For example, an attachment to the not-obscuring view of causality is challenged by the first part of the Wu-men-kuan verse, "Not falling, not obscuring: /Two sides of the same coin [which can also be read as "Odd and even are on 67 SHII:231-32. 68 From the Hyakunijussoku W=tRlJ, as cited in Kraft, Eloquent Zen, p. 116, originally in Hirano S6j6, Daito Zen no tankyu (Ky6iku shinch6sha), p. 61. 69 Shibayama, Zen Comments on the Mumonkan, p. 39. 70 This comparison is suggested by Akizuki Ry6min, Zen mondo, p. 131.</page><page sequence="32">288 STEVEN HEINE one die"]," and an attachment to the not-falling view of non-causal- ity is overcome by the second half of the verse, "Not obscuring, not falling: /A thousand entanglements, ten thousand entangle- ments!"'71 Similarly, the introductory section of the Ts'ung-jung lu eliminates a fixation on the correctness of not-obscuring by assert- ing that "if you swallow just one drop of fox drool, it cannot be spit out for thirty years. "72 Another example of Sung poetry highlights the paradoxical relativity of opposite views by reversing their se- quence in the first and third lines - a feature seen in numerous verse commentaries - and suggesting a transcendence of the de- bate in the last two lines:73 Not obscuring and not falling, Did the old man make a great mistake? Not falling and not obscuring, This is obviously correct. I explain this again to all of you, Do you understand it now, or not? A green mountain rising above the field, A pilgrim traveling even beyond the mountain. In addition, in the Wu-men-kuan the affirmation and denial of causali- ty as well as of the fox and human existences are ultimately equal- ized, for the monk is said to have experienced his fox incarnations as a joyful blessing: "If you can see this with a single eye [of insight] you will understand how the former head of Pai-chang monastery cultivated his five hundred incarnations."74 However, the issue of why Pai-chang could be considered to culti- vate his fox lives raises an important question about the ethical im- plications of karma that is also not directly addressed or resolved in the commentaries. One possibility is that the former Pai-chang transfigured as a bodhisattva-like mission, but this conflicts with the statement that he has been punished. On the other hand, the suggestion that he valued his fox lives, even if expressed in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, may be effective in highlighting paradox- 71 T 48:293b. 72 T 48:231c. 73 HTC: 115:113-1 74 T 48:293b.</page><page sequence="33">THE WILD FOX KOAN 289 ical nonduality yet problematic from the standpoint of morality. If causality contains its own transcendence or already encompasses non-causality, as the majority of commentaries suggest, where is the imperative to follow the Buddhist precepts as a path of moral purification? Furthermore, is there not an antinomian implication, or the beginning of a slippery slope leading to misbehavior, in that the equality of causality and non-causality eventually results in a privileging of the not-falling standpoint? Once this standpoint takes priority, one could be led either to the path of Buddha or to its oppo- site, the path of Mara, which is paradoxically identified with Bud- dha, as suggested in the Vimalakirti Sutra passage, "If the bodhisatt- va treads the wrong ways he enters the Buddha path, " or in Ikkyui's famous saying that it is more difficult to enter the realm of Mara than the realm of Buddha.75 An aphorism from the Lin-chi lu (a recorded sayings text that does not contain commentary on the koan) contrasts with the antinomian tendency and seems to assert the priority of the not-obscuring view in a way that accords with the literal reading: "if [a seeker] cannot distinguish Mara from Bud- dha, then he has only left one home to enter another. He may be dubbed a karma-creating sentient being, but he cannot be called a true renouncer of home."76 This warns of the danger in the Zen paradoxical view which "unconsciously lapses into Mara in the name of Buddha and yet believes itself to be practicing Buddha."" A refutation of the antinomian tendency is most forcefully seen in Dogen's later, 12-fascicle ShoboJgenzo text in which he rewrote several fascicles from the early, 75-fascicle Shibodgenzo.78 In the commentary on the koan in "Daishugyo," Dogen characteristically argues for ? Charles Luk, trans., The Vimalakirti Nirdesa Suitra (Berkeley: Shambala, 1972), p. 81. Concerning Ikkyui, his poetry alluding to the "fox k6an" also "speaks of his fear that his own Zen [marked by licentious behavior] was one that ignored karma," according to Sonja Arntzen, trans., Ikkyu and the Crazy Cloud Anthology: A Zen Poet of MedievalJapan (Tokyo: Uni- versity of Tokyo Press, 1986), p. 34. 76 RR, p. 52; Sasaki, The Recorded Sayings of Ch'an Master Lin-chi, p. 12. 77 Masao Abe, A Study of Dogen: His Philosophy and Religion, ed.

He thus asserts that the fox/monk spoke the truth in his original denial of causality and that these words are of equal value to the current Pai-chang's maintaining the importance of not ob- scuring causality. But in Dogen's later interpretation in the "Jin- shin inga" fascicle, this paradoxical view is not satisfactory. Both Shobodgenzo fascicles at least on the surface refute the elements of su- perstition and supernaturalism which may distract from a single- minded pursuit of enlightenment. Yet, whereas "Daishugya" re- fuses to criticize the old monk's view of not-falling, "Jinshin inga" repudiates the position Dogen embraced a decade before. In the later work he asserts emphatically that only not-obscuring is ac- curate and that not-falling, which is equal to the denial of causality, must be mistaken: "The single greatest limitation of the monks of Sung China today is that they do not realize that not falling into causality' is a false teaching."7 In "Jinshin inga," Dogen also criticizes the verse commentaries of three of his predecessors, Hung-chih (who collected the koans in the Ts'ung-jung lu), Yiian-wu (commentator of the Pi-yen lu koans collected by Hsiieh-tou), and Ta-hui (collector of the Cheng-fa yen-tsang) - all towering figures in the Sung era koan tradition for their lack of a genuinely dynamic approach to causality.80 The verse by Hung-chih cited above, "To talk about not falling into or not obscuring causality/ Is to remain captive to the discriminating mind, " according to Dogen, overemphasizes the relativity of causal- ity and non-causality and has a nihilistic implication. Yiian-wu's verse, "For nothing can escape from the perfect mirror of causality/ Which is as vast and universal as the sky," seems better in stressing that "nothing can escape . .. causality," but even this has traces of denying cause-and-effect in its eternalistic association of causality with the emptiness of "sky." Finally, Ta-hui's verse, "Not falling into and not obscuring causality/ Are as closely related as stone to earth," in Dogen's view, lapses into the standpoint of denying causality. For the later Dogen, the real problem is not simply a matter of 79 SH 11:433. The 92-fascicle Shobogenzo combines the 75-fascicle and 12-fascicle editions with five additional fascicles. 80 SHII:435-37.</page><page sequence="35">THE WILD FOX KOAN 291 identifying polarities or of shifting the conclusion from one side to the other, but of equalizing them in such a way that the moral imper- ative of karmic causality is highlighted rather than concealed. If the morality of cause-and-effect is suppressed because it is overly influenced by an emphasis on transcendence, then a genuine state of non-causality which is never free from causality cannot be at- tained. D-ogen attempts to resolve this dilemma by asserting in "Jin- shin inga" that "the law of causality (inga) is clear and impersonal (or selfless)" (watakushi nashi). That is, the freedom of non-causality can be attained only through the continuing process of purification perfected within the realm of causality. From this perspective, causality functions in an impersonal manner regardless of whether it is accepted or rejected, or affirmed or denied by particular per- sons. Thus, according to Dogen's standpoint of "deep faith in causality" (jinshin inga), Shibayama's argument mentioned above about the "free use" of both subjection to and independence from causality seems to misrepresent enlightenment, which must be based on a wholehearted acceptance of selfless karma. A literal reading of the koan associates the image of the fox with the misconception of not-falling, but in the paradoxical view, as Daito's brief verse above suggests, the fox reflects an attachment to either not-falling or not-obscuring. Why does the late Dogen reas- sert the literal view, and what are the implications for the use of fox imagery? There are two main interpretations. According to the majority of Dogen scholars, the "Jinshin inga" and other fascicles in the 12-fascicle Shobogenzo were written for novices who could not appreciate the subtlety of the paradoxical view expressed in the 75- fascicle text.81 However, according to scholars in the recent method- ology known as Critical Buddhism (hihan bukkyo #TWIfA), especially Hakamaya Noriaki, the 12-fascicle text expresses a bold refutation of any trace of animism that the paradoxical view still allows.82 81 Kawamura K6do iJntt*j, "Junikanbon o meguru shosetsu" t -- -A C b &lt; M I in Budda kara Dogen e fA&amp; d)., ed.

A close reading of the 12-fascicle text indicates that both camps the majority group and Hakamaya - overlook the interface of Zen texts and folk Buddhist literary genres, thereby reaching a conclu- sion that is overly clear-cut and one-sided. Although Dogen fre- quently criticizes animistic practices in the 12-fascicle text in favor of a literal view of karma that seems consistent with the approach ex- pressed in Pali sources, at the same time he often appeals to another early Buddhist source, the mythological, supernatural jdtaka tales which influenced setsuwa literature, in order to illustrate his view of the inviolability of karmic retribution and the possibilities for revers- ing negative karma through the act of repentance. For example, Do5- gen cites anecdotes which probably derive from the Abhidharma- Maha-vibha-sa- about a eunuch who regains his potency and a prostitute who is redeemed when as a joke she touches a Buddhist robe for a moment.83 The strict affirmation of causality is somewhat ironically based on an acceptance of supernaturalism in a text that also rejects it. It is plausible that Dogen was reacting to the impact of the conception of karma in the setsuwa genre, which may also have influenced his early ambiguity in "Daishugyo" about the propriety of the funeral ceremony. The main point here is that Do- gen was not so much interested in a literal reading of the koan or of supernatural beliefs but in overcoming the antinomian view and restoring the moral implications of karma. This was achieved by touching base with the undiscussed background of fox imagery as a symbol of illusion - neither explicitly endorsed nor refuted - un- derlying any apparent ambivalence in his early and later interpreta- tions. FOX AS A POPULAR RELIGIOUS SYMBOL OF BIVALENCY Before analyzing folk religious elements in the "fox koan," it is necessary to discuss how many koans share a discursive arena with morality tale literature in that both genres reflect an encounter with 83 T 27:592a-93b.</page><page sequence="37">THE WILD FOX KOAN 293 supernaturalism that determines their spiritual message. However, while the major koan commentaries deal to a large extent with philosophical arguments, often in at least indirect competition with Taoist metaphysics and Neo-Confucian ethics, setsuwa literature represents a form of preaching that absorbs and refashions popular religiosity in terms of the doctrine of the immediate retribution of good and evil (C. hsien-pao shan-o, J. genpo- zen'aku Ik). 84 The concrete, inescapable effects of causality are played out in narratives about the release of karmic turmoil based on themes of temptation, lust, greed, ambition, betrayal, delusion, and revenge, as well as repentance and compassion. The tales teach lessons that drive home the need to avoid succumbing to the foibles of deceit, arrogance, and false pretense by cultivating an attitude of acceptance and gratefulness for one's lot in life. People are urged not to give in to the temptation to overstep the bounds of fate and circumstance sym- bolized by the fox's transfiguration, but instead to identify sym- pathetically with the plight of family and friends and to heed their pleas .85 For many interpreters koans based on self-emancipation and fei- jen literature based on divine intercession cannot be juxtaposed as interacting and overlapping discourses, for there is simply an epistemological gap which makes them distant and unrelated. William LaFleur's chapter "In and Out of the Rokudo" in The Karma of Words is one of the few studies to discuss the "fox koan" directly in the context of morality tales, particularly the Nihon ryoiki. LaFleur concludes that popular morality operates through the paradigms of the infiltration of deities into the world and the tran- scendence (or rebirth) of believers in the Pure Land. Koans - here LaFleur follows the paradoxical model of interpretation - are an ex- ample of the copenetration of ultimate and phenomenal realms or, 84 Kyoko Motomichi Nakamura, Miraculous Stories from the Japanese Buddhist Tradition: The Nihon ry6iki of the Monk Kyokai (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971), p. 33; the hsien (J. gen) in hsien-pao (J. genpo) refers to retribution in the immediate or present life, but the principle also encompasses karmic effects in the three tenses including the next life and future lives. 85 Kiyoshi Nozaki, Kitsune: Japan 's Fox of Mystery, Romance and Humor (Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1961), p. 21.</page><page sequence="38">294 STEVEN HEINE further, a sustained process of ludization in which everything, in- cluding moral judgments, is conditioned, relative, and nonhierarchi- cal.86 Therefore, the genres represent separate, parallel, but incom- patible paradigms. However, this argument fails to see that both kaans and morality tales are part of the "move to assimilate shaman- ic symbols . . . in which the threat of defilement is domesticated and assimilated into the structure of the sacred. m87 The genres inter- pret the encounter with the supernatural from opposite though com- plementary standpoints. K6ans store supernaturalism in a muted structure while the main structure forefronts a paradoxical perspec- tive of critical transcendence collapsing all dualities. Morality tales are the inversion of this, forefronting supernaturalism as the main structure while harboring a demythological, allegorical level of sym- bolism based on the bivalency of fox imagery beyond literal claims of divine intervention. The "fox koan" is but one of numerous examples in the Wu-men- kuan and other collections in which key aspects of popular religiosi- ty, including pilgrimages to cultic sites, shamanistic trance and bilo- cation, and the banishing of demons and converting of indigenous gods through the use of miraculous symbols and icons, form a dis- cursive context alluded to or evoked, though they are often at the same time critiqued and scorned.88 Although the commentaries generally tried to distance themselves from the mythological roots of Zen discourse by defusing or reorienting any focus on the reality or unreality of folk beliefs in favor of the rhetoric of abbreviation and iconoclasm, in many koan cases supernatural themes provide a necessary narrative background. A prominent example in the Wu- men-kuan is case no. 35 which reads simply, "Master Wu-tsu said, 86 William R.

An interesting aspect of this is the way many k6ans lend themselves to a "monogatari-ization" as in Akizuki, Zen mondo.</page><page sequence="39">THE WILD FOX KOAN 295 'Ch'ien and her soul are separated. Which one is the true soul?' " This case appears to be dealing with the philosophical topic of non- duality: how can a person be divided into component parts, such as body and soul, when she constitutes an indivisible collective unity? Yet, the case is just as clearly based on a famous T'ang legend recorded in the Li-hun chi ,"d (J. Rikonki), expressing the theme of duty versus passion (which later became such an important influence on Tokugawa literature).89 The folktale uses supernatural elements such as a spirit journey and bilocation in the story of a young woman who appears to her parents, who have resisted her wedding plans, to be sick and lifeless when she is separated for five years from the man she loves. Yet the "other Ch'ien" has run off with her lover and spent the time in a secret marriage. When she returns home out of a sense of responsibility for her family, Ch'ien is reunited with her tormented soul that was manifested in a body lying motionless in bed the entire time of her flight. Everyone, now purged of feelings of guilt and deception, is able to experience a sense of harmony and fulfilled responsibilities. A key strategy of a number of koans is the transmutation from the standpoint of critical transcendence of the theme of "the veneration of the accomplished meditator - the great ascetic, sunk in profound samddhi or wielding the psychic powers of dhya-na, "9 which 89 The Li-hun chi is discussed in Akizuki, Mumonkan oyomu E_ I'2P (T6sho insatsu, 1990), pp. 15-16; Hirata, Mumonkan, pp. 130-31; and Shibayama, Zen Comments on the Mumonkan, pp. 253-54. To show that the "fox k6an" is but one of many cases in which mythical themes figure prominently, I will cite several more instances although a full analysis lies beyond the scope of this paper: a case dealing with a woman who cannot be roused from deep trance even by hundreds and thousands of manifestations of Ma-njusri until a lowly bo- dhisattva liberates her; a case containing the narrative of Hui-neng who, after being being pur- sued in his flight from the monastery, casts down his robe, symbolizing faith, which proves to be "immovable as a mountain," and who asks the stunned pursuer one of Zen's most famous demythological utterances, "What is your original face?"; a case in which a monk ex- periences a revelatory dream of being called upon to give a spontaneous dharma-talk before Maitreya, the future buddha; and two cases on Chao-chou's extrasensory mental faculties - one in which he enters a "dharma contest" with two hermits, and the other in which he "sees through" an old woman who has been sucessfully challenging Zen monks entering the cultic center at the foot of Mt. Wu-t'ai-shan and who may represent a shamaness. These examples beginning with the story of Ch'ien are Wu-men-kuan case nos. 35, 42, 11, 31, 25, 23, or T 48:297b, 298a-b, 294b, 297a, 296a, 295c, respectively; see also Ts'ung-jung lu no. 10 (T 48:233a-c), which is very close to Wu-men-kuan no. 31, and nos. 24 (T48:242c-243b) and 59 (T 48:264a-c), both of which deal with snake deities, among others. 90 Carl Bielefeldt, Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation (Berkeley: University of California</page><page sequence="40">296 STEVEN HEINE was also a longstanding morality tale topos. An example of this is "Nan-chuian meets the earth-deity.9'" The background is the no- tion found throughout Zen hagiographical literature of the encoun- ter between a master and local spirits, celestial beings, or demons who have jurisdiction over a particular domain.92 Prior to attaining full realization the master-to-be makes and receives offerings from the gods, but once perfected he escapes from ever being seen or known by the other-worldly entities because his supranormal power based on meditation (C. shen-t'ung, J. jinzu- *A, literally "divine penetration," Skt. abhidna-) surpasses the powers deriving from their fri-jen status. If the attained master is subsequently spotted, however, it is taken as a sign of failure highlighting the need to con- tinue his training and to appease the deity. According to the koan, Nan-chuian is surprised as he enters a vegetable patch, where he usually goes unnoticed, when he is greeted by a novice who says that the field god had notified him of the master's imminent arrival. Nan-chiuan now must make an offering to the deity before resum- ing his discipline.93 The key to understanding the discursive function of the case lies in the context in which it is cited and interpreted. For example, when used in transmission of the lamp texts such as the Ching-te chuan-teng lu, the original source of the anecdote, it contributes to the genealogy of the master. The case is also mentioned in Dogen's "Gyoji" fascicle (part I), the closest his Shibo-genzo writings come to the transmission text genre, as he retells his lineal history in light of the doctrine of "sustained [zazen] practice" (gyoji F7O) which has Press, 1988), p. 71. 91 SH 1: 180; also in Mana Sh/bogenzo no. 18 (in goi sakuin, p. 5), and Eihei kiroku 9.63 (pp. 381-82).

Early in the fascicle, Dogen refers to masters Ching-ching and 1-chang as being notable because they cannot be perceived by the native gods. Then he contrasts Nan- chuian, who has been spotted, with Hung-chih, before whom a local deity is literally stopped in its tracks as its feet will not budge (recalling the "immovable robe" in the legend of Hui-neng's es- cape). On the one hand, Dogen seems to be scoring a sectarian point on behalf of Hung-chih, a predecessor of his mentor Ju-ching, while denigrating a master from a rival Rinzai lineage. Up to this stage, Dagen is operating within, though at the same time refashion- ing, the standard mythological framework. But he then moves on to demythology by commenting that the real meaning of being seen or not seen lies not in supernatural power in the literal sense but in the perpetuation of authentic discipline. This requires an ongoing pro- cess of detachment from or the casting off of conventional pursuits. Yet Dogen's demythological turn reveals an assumption of the effi- cacy of the indigenous spirit world. Whereas koans transmute supernaturalism from a transcendental standpoint, morality tales generate a "polarity pattern" based on the creative tension between delusion and redemption.94 It appears that in the pre-Buddhist view of supernatural beings representing a combination of nearly indistinguishable angelic/benevolent/self- sacrificing and demonic/chaotic/destructive elements, there is no clear moral judgment.95 These beings tend to exact revenge rather than retribution and foster gratification instead of spiritual fulfill- ment. Buddhist morality literature draws on the bivalent imagery of foxes and snakes as deities or demons, protectors or cunning oppo- nents, to create a transition from a horizontal, nonevaluative or amoral twofoldness of guardianship and demonism to a vertical, evaluative or moral contrast of the forces of compassion (Buddha) and deception (Mara). Whatever is threatening, disorderly, disrup- tive, and chaotic gets translated into bad karma. Buddhism claims that its deities are effective in performing exorcisms because they 9' Robert C. Ellwood, Introducing Religion: From Inside and Outside (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1983), p. 19. 95 Blake Morgan Young, Ueda Akinari (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1982), p. 61.</page><page sequence="42">298 STEVEN HEINE have a universal power that overcomes the fragmentized abilities of non-syncretized spirits. Yet the appropriation of supernaturalism is more complex than that because animals which are demons in one context can also function as compassionate Buddhist gods. While op- posite forces are generally held apart in any particular tale, they also shift roles and reverse positions when the literature is surveyed as a whole. In some morality tales involving clerics, Mara-like foxes seduce virtuous priests, or priests who are overly virtuous are sus- pected of being foxes in disguise. In other tales, bodhisattvas take the form of foxes which function as catalysts leading people to the verge of a breakthrough.96 The wild fox is at once assimilated and stigmatized, a bivalent view captured from a different angle in Zen's anti-supernatural rhetoric and its inversion. For example, foxes associated with Inari shrines that are often amalgamated with Buddhist and Zen deities can be used to exorcise demons, but foxes associated with the Izumo shrine are excluded from this category and their sorcery must be exorcized by other foxes charged with sacred powers.97 An illustration of how supernaturalism becomes a symbol of an interior struggle within the structure of the polarity pattern is the film Ugetsu, a postwar refashioning by director Kenji Mizoguchi of Tokugawa era didactic tales by Ueda Akinari that were influenced in turn by a variety of medieval Chinese and Japanese folklore col- lections.98 At the beginning of the narrative, Genjuro, a potter, and his brother-in-law Tobei decide to pursue their fortune in the city during wartime, despite the warnings of their wives and the village- master that they stick to their own trade and not overstep their talents or fate.

Tobei becomes a famous samurai after stealing the severed head of an enemy chieftain, but in his absence his wife is raped and when he finally returns home he finds that she has had to become a prostitute to support herself. The potter becomes wealthy, or so it seems, and he later learns that his wife has been brutally attacked and killed while he was away. Prior to the tragedy, Genjuro fantasizes about buying his wife an expensive kimono with his new fortune; she says she loves the clothes he has given her not for their fineness but for the love they reflect. Just as he is envisioning his wife in the new garment, he becomes entranced and seduced by a beautiful ghost - according to one of the stories in Ugetsu monogatari it is a trickster fox - whose identity is fully concealed and who demands his devotion, as in a fa- mous Kuniyoshi woodblock print.99 "I wouldn't care," he declares in the midst of his passion while living in her luxurious mansion, "if you were a demon! I will not let you go! I never imagined such plea- sures existed! This is divine! It is paradise!" However, when Gen- juro goes to town to buy a gift for his ghost-bride, a Buddhist priest seeing him walk down the street immediately recognizes his ailment and, reminding him of his familial obligations, provides a protec- tion by painting Sanskrit letters in the esoteric Siddham script on his body while su-tras are chanted in the background. The potter 9 The film seems to be based on two, or perhaps three, stories in the collection of nine tales in five volumes dealing with supernatural foxes, ghosts, and spells in a highly moralistic con- text. One main influence is "The House Amid the Thickets" ("Asaji ga yado"), in which a man leaves home to seek his fortune and returns after seven years pass "as in a dream" to find that his wife had died, yet "bewitched by a fox" he thinks at first he finds her and the house intact. When he recognizes that his wife is a ghost and that desolation has overtaken his former home, foxes and badgers appear in the area. Filled with contrition he confesses his guilt to his grandfather. Another influence is "The Caldron of Kibitsu" ("Kibitsu no Kama"), in which a man who is haunted by the ghost of the wife he deserted for a beautiful mistress is at one point shocked back to his senses by the barking of a dog - according to fox lore beginning with Jenshi chuan, dogs are the one natural enemy of fox spirits. The wife later appears in the form of a serpent, and he is taken to a Buddhist soothsayer/diviner who per- forms an exorcism by writing Sanskrit spells over his entire body and warning him to stay pure. But as the man does not offer a full confession of his sin, he is eventually tortured and devoured by the ghost. The third story is "The Lust of the White Serpent" ("Jasei no in"), in which a man is tormented by a serpent which due to his lack of courage causes him to do vile things, but in this case there is a successful exorcism and the animal form of the demon is exposed and destroyed. Also, a print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi which shows the transfigura- tion into a vixen while the vulpine source remains hidden from the view of the bewitched vic- tim can be found in Juliet Piggot, Japanese Mythology, p. 23.</page><page sequence="44">300 STEVEN HEINE returns for the last time to the mansion which is only revealed in its true form, as in many early Chinese stories, as a burned-out hovel after the ghost becomes frightened and dissolves. Genjuro then jour- neys home to seek out his wife and succumbs to one last delusion that she is still alive and waiting for him. When he realizes that she has been killed during his illusory dalliance he suffers an intolerable grief mollified only by the calming voice of his wife's spirit that en- courages his everyday labors while he cares for his son alongside the similarly chastened Tobei and his wife. When morality tales are interpreted for their multifaceted literary symbolism rather than taken literally or seen as truncated theologi- cal tracts that merely assert the efficacy of magic, they have a dis- tinct communicative power deriving from a sophisticated theoreti- cal base on the nature of and possibilities for overcoming human frailty and folly that converges with the metaphysics of karma.'00 The setsuwa philosophy can be referred to as an "illusionary real- ism" because the chimerical is more real than what is apprehended with the senses.'0' There is a Kafkaesque quality in that the ultimate aim is to eliminate illusion, but the hallucinatory events are neces- sarily portrayed at a key point in the narratives in realistic lan- guage, even while accompanied by supernatural occurrences. This establishes a convergence of perception and external reality, akin to Yogacara philosophy of "idealism," so that when the hero is in the depths of illusion, such as the potter's ghostly mansion, that is just what is depicted. The reality of illusion, or the literal depiction of chimera, equals the illusion of reality, or the character's inability to 1'0 There is also sometimes a sophisticated philosophical perspective expressed in commen- taries on fox folktales as in the following passage which outdoes Chuang Tzu on the meaning of a story in the Liao-chai chih-i collection known as "A Fox Dream": "So he wasn't dream- ing, and yet it was a dream; he was dreaming, and yet it wasn't a dream. How was it not a dream? How was it not not a dream? How was it not not not a dream?" In Judith T.

The power of animals to transfigure and bewitch functions as a symbol of attachments and misdeeds, for it never affects people who are not currently suffering from these problems. In Ugetsu the ghost is a mirror image of how the potter's rather understandable yearnings have resulted in lust, greed, and indifference to his family. In Konjaku tales, "transforma- tion into a snake was that which happened to individuals who valued [things of this world] too highly. But it posed no threat to in- nocent bystanders. It merely lurked behind the scenes as the symbol of the evil inside us all. Interestingly, it was mostly Buddhist monks and women who needed to fear the snake within themselves. ' '102 Thus, an exorcism of the interior snake or fox is not merely an exter- nal ritual but functions as a thorn to remove a thorn, or a poison to counteract poison - a characterization often applied to the function of koans. The exorcism is based on the power that exists within peo- ple to recognize and come to terms with their shame, and it symbol- izes a consequent sense of revulsion and profound change of heart. The main moral implication is that being enraptured by illusion must be taken to its logical extreme or "bottoming-out" stage - as in the potter's hopeless, delirious passion - as a necessary emotion- al turning point before attaining transformation. In contrast to some koan commentaries in which correct understanding alone is sufficient for attaining liberation, morality tales require a full cycle of karmic suffering and emancipation.103 Undergoing bewitchment eventually results in the drama of self-realization that philosophy alone cannot express. The setsuwa approach resembles practices in esoteric Buddhism in which the experiences of suffering, hell, and often symbolic death are necessary for spiritual rebirth.104 102 W.

Arthur Braverman (San Francis- co: North Point Press, 1988), p. 28. On the other hand, Bankei, when questioned by a monk struggling with the "fox koan" responds, "I don't make people here waste their time on worthless old documents like that," in Norman Waddell, trans., The Unborn: The Life and Teaching of Zen Master Bankei, 1622-1693 (San Francisco: North Point Press, 1984), p. 70. 104 Blacker, Catalpa Bow, pp. 208-34.</page><page sequence="46">302 STEVEN HEINE Cycle of Appearance and Disappearance The interesection of philosophical paradoxicality and folk reli- gious bivalency in the "fox koan" is reflected in the rhythm of the appearance/disappearance of the fei-jen which coincides with the stages in the former Pai-chang's spiritual progression from the deluded to the liberated side of the polarity pattern. A tale from the Konjaku monogatari collection (no. 16.17) illustrates the rhythmic structure.105 Yoshifuji, whose wife has gone for a trip to the capital, is seduced by a beautiful woman under the approving eye of her father who says that he "was always meant to come here. " The cou- ple pledge their eternal love, have a child together, live in her man- sion, and Yoshifuji feels that he has not a care in the world. His brothers, worried at home, call upon Kannon for help in finding him. Suddenly a man with a stick, a messenger of the Buddhist dei- ty, arrives at his new home, scares everyone in the household away, and Yoshifuji crawls out from the storehouse under his old house. He starts to show off his new son to his older boy, declaring the youngster to be his true heir, but there is in reality no one with him. After a servant finds lots of foxes under the storehouse, it turns out that Yoshifuji had been tricked into marrying a vixen. A yin-yang diviner is called upon to perform an exorcism and eventually he comes to his senses. "The thirteen days he had spent under the storehouse had seemed to him like thirteen years, and the few inches of clearance between the ground and the floor of the building had looked to him like a stately home. The foxes had done all this. " In a similar vein but featuring a Buddhist priest in a tale from the Otogizo-shi collection, an old priest succumbs to a fox bewitchment, thinking that he has lived with a beautiful woman for seven years in a large mansion with a big gate. When Jizo appears in the form of a young priest carrying a staff, the old priest feels that he has awoken from a long dream. A fox appears as the old priest realizes, "The mansion, the splendid large dwelling house with a big gate was gone! The fine bamboo-blinds and mats were now changed into scraps of straw-mats!1 1106 105 Rovall Tyler, trans., Japanese Tales (New York: Pantheon, 1988), p. 118 ; NKB T 24:56- 58. 106 Nozaki, Kitsune, p. 164.</page><page sequence="47">THE WILD FOX KOAN 303 The main principle underlying the cycle is that foxes at first remain invisible, hiding themselves behind their transfigured pose, and it is only "when a supernatural creature has conceded defeat, [that] it will show its true form."'107 In a Konjaku tale (27.5), for example, when a creature that had been frightening people was caught it confessed, "I am a water spirit," and then it disappeared, never to be heard from again."' In the case of Yoshifuj i, foxes are at first nowhere in evidence, but they appear as soon as his illusory world starts dissolving due to the exorcism. In the koan the monk says that he is a fox but he appears as a man who is only seen by Pai- chang. The other monks are told a funeral will be taking place but they are surprised because they do not know of thefei-jen's existence and no one else has been sick in the infirmary. This cognitive gap is recognized by Dogen's "Daishugyo" commentary when he ques- tions the propriety of granting a ceremony to a being whose human, let alone Buddhist, status has not been verified. When the current Pai-chang uncovers the fox corpse on the far side of the mountain, its death and burial represent the demise of the former Pai-chang's illusion. It is possible to reconstruct five stages of appearance/disappear- ance that symbolize the sequence of self-realization taking place in the koan: possession, confession, exorcism, renunciation, and repen- tance. The first stage is the transfiguration that represents an ex- perience of liminality or the crossing over into the realm of bivalen- cy. This state can take place in one of two directions: either a person is changed into a fox as punishment or as a bodhisattva's compas- sionate choice, or a fox anthropomorphizes. Regardless of the direc- tion of the shapeshifting, the meaning is that the more deep-seated the delusion the more convincing or frightening is the status of the apparition. In the koan the first stage applies to the old monk who, as afei-jen due to karmic retribution, attends the sermons each day with the congregation, disguised as his former self. The next two stages refer to the way delusions as the root-cause of the transfiguration are exposed and brought to a level of self-aware- ness leading to their elimination through ritual purification. In 107 Masato Mori, "Konjaku Monogatari-shui: Supernatural Creatures and Order," Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 9.2-3 (1982): 165. Jenshi chuan has a similar sequence. 108 NKBT25:83-84.</page><page sequence="48">304 STEVEN HEINE setsuwa tales, the kuai being "appears only after the man has ac- knowledged his past evil and begged for compassion in the life to come . . . It is only when he has taken the two steps of confession and repudiation of past evils that he can be saved."'109 In the koan, the old monk who gives no outward sign of being a fox explains his true identity, confesses the wrongdoing that caused it, and asks for and receives assistance from the current Pai-chang, all before the fox body becomes perceptible as a corpse once he has been released from his punishment. This requires two steps. The first is confes- sion, or the former Pai-chang's recognition and acknowledgment of his attachments and misdeeds. The next step (or third stage) is the exorcism, or the use of an appropriate gesture or utterance to complete the eradication of the invading spirit and the elimination of defilement. Buddhist exor- cisms can be homeopathic or non-homeopathic, ecstatic or enstatic. Ugetsu, like the case of Soto priest Genno, is an example of non- homeopathic exorcism because the use of Sanskrit letters evokes the foreign, universal Buddhist doctrine and creates an antipathy with the local, indigenous spirit world, whereas the Mahikari okiyome rite is ecstatic resulting in hysteria, convulsions, glossolalia, and so on. However, many Buddhist exorcisms are homeopathic and enstatic, as in the use of dialogue to communicate with and discover the needs or demands of the intruding power."0 The turning word in the koan is an example in the latter category because the liberating power is based simply on the substitution of a single kanji in a four- kanji phrase: from pu-lo yin-kuo to pu-mei yin-kuo. The term lo (J. raku) generally has positive connotations in a Buddhist context be- cause it implies the casting or falling off of attachments, as in Dogen's notion of "casting off body/mind" (C. shen-hsin t'o-lo, J. shinjin-datsuraku 4,CARX), and the term mei generally has negative connotations because it implies the blindness or foolishness of delu- sions. When the negational prefix pu is added, however, the connota- tions are reversed and pu-mei becomes positive as a double negation, which suggests that the exorcistic quality of the turning word touches base with paradoxical wordplay leading to sudden release as '09 Kelsey, "Salvation of the Snake," p. 109.

The ritual function of the turning word helps answer the ques- tion, Why could not the former Pai-chang, who must have under- stood his error and been capable of correcting it intellectually, liber- ate himself without the need to consult the current Pai-chang after endless transmigrations? An aspect of the polarity pattern is that, as an icon of delusion, fox imagery allows for a metaphorical distance or psychological displacement by the deluded person who can avoid direct blame or at least have a sense of shared responsibility. Exor- cism in Buddhist literature and practice does not deny the role of in- dividuality or interiority altogether but creates a neutral focal point based on the integration of external and internal, or objective and subjective factors. According to Winston Davis, the psychology of exorcism "distributes guilt and responsibility in a way that is quite foreign to Western notions. One's misfortunes and failures need not be borne alone, since those in the spirit world share the responsibil- ity. In other words, responsibility is partially shifted to an external cause, reducing individual guilt.".'. In addition, Carmen Blacker observes that because of the de-emphasis on individuality, "cases of fox possession only rarely find their way into mental hospitals in Japan. The patients will prefer the drama of the therapy to be con- ducted in religious terms, the malady caused by a being from another plane and the cure effected by a priest initiated into the sacred life.""

See Peter Brown, The Cult of the Saints. Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981) on the role of praesentia and potentia in exorcism in the early medieval West. On the other hand, in Japan claims of peo- ple being possessed by a fox (kitsune-tsuki), as well as the magical use of foxes (kitsune-mochi) are so frequently reported even today, especially in some regions such as Izumo or among certain population sectors, that it is considered a culture-bound psycho-spiritual disorder (sei- shin byo gffqP) comparable to "running amok" in Malaya or anorexa nervosa in Western countries; see Robert C. Carson, James N. Butcher, and James C. Coleman, Abnormal Psy- chology, 8th ed. (Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman, 1990), p. 85. At times there seems to be a socio- political significance to reports of fox possession and fox sorcery when, for example, a particu- lar group (i.e., nouveau riche) are targeted for stigmatization. 113 An interesting contemporary Western literary illustration of the displacement process is</page><page sequence="50">306 STEVEN HEINE The final two stages of the cycle are renunciation and repentance which have the capacity to reverse negative karma and lead to equa- nimity and release. In the Yoshifuji tale the foxes flee from the store- house as he comes to his senses. Similarly, in a Konjaku tale (13.17) a monk during a pilgrimage takes refuge in a cave where he is fright- ened and recites the Lotus Sutra for protection. 4 A large snake about to devour him consequently disappears. Then, "After a pounding rain, a man comes to the cave and thanks the monk, telling him that the rain drops were really tears of repentance, and that he has now been released from his evil existence as a snake." In the koan the de-transfiguration of the fox, which turns up dead and is buried by Pai-chang, represents the old monk's renunciation. The final stage requires an act of contrition to demonstrate that one regrets prior wrongdoing and has learned from the experience of overcoming il- lusion, as when the potter in Ugetsu returns with his son to daily chores. In the koan Huang-po's slap is a public display of the chastis- ing and humiliation of his mentor Pai-chang, an intriguing role reversal that becomes paradigmatic in Zen lineal transmission narra- tives of disciples gaining approval by standing up to or surpassing their masters. But the question remains why the current Pai-chang is chastised when he administered the exorcism. One interpretation is that Huang-po is performing an identification of vulpine or human exis- tence, a common theme in fox folklore, knowing better than simply to trust that his master is no different than the former Pai-chang. This interpretation sees the slap as the exorcism of the exorcist. Since fox mythology has created a state of mystification, equivalent to a dream-within-a-dream, two acts of awakening are required from the Zen standpoint. As Pai-chang gives the explanation of why the fox is receiving a monk's burial, all the other monks look on in Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (New York: Signet, 1962), in which in the third act called "The Exorcism," following the second act "Walpurgisnacht," two cou- ples through their interactions with one another during an evening of drinking and shocking personal disclosures come to terms with their respective delusions reflected by hysterical preg- nancies and imaginary offspring that were generated as psychological compensations for in- fertility and sterility, which symbolize larger problems in postwar middle class America. 114 Kelsey, "Salvation of the Snake," p. 103; NKBT 24:231-32.</page><page sequence="51">THE WILD FOX KOAN 307 with disbelief for they are amazed that he has been deceived by afei- jen, which would be a sure sign of the loss of a power basic to all Zen masters. Huang-po's slap demonstrates the fact of non-deception to the other monks, and at the same time Pai-chang, who was preoccu- pied with his exploits in the realm of the supernatural, gratefully praises his disciple for bringing him back to his senses by pointing out the intra-psychic dimension of his encounter with the fox spirit. CONCLUDING REFLECTIONS ON OVERCOMING THE TWO-TIERED MODEL This paper has sorted out the intertwining of two paradigms of morality in the overt, philosophical and the muted, popular reli- gious discursive structures of the koan which reflect conflicting yet complementary views of the meaning of the term "wild fox." Both paradigms emphasize the need to discover an underlying con- nection between polarized elements, including the natural and supernatural, and causality and non-causality. The overt structure is metaphysical and is based on the intellectual struggle to resolve the relation between the inexorability of karmic retribution and the attainment of freedom from cause-and-effect in terms of the para- doxical identity of apparently opposite realms. This paradigm claims to surpass by reversing previous interpretations that tend to dichotomize and prioritize causality and non-causality. The para- doxical conclusion expressed in kaan commentaries violates the liter- al message of the case which thus creates another level of paradox- icality. The covert structure is mythological and is based on a bivalency of delusion and redemption; the distinction between good and evil can be conflated but never collapsed, and a clear and deci- sive victor invariably emerges as part of the polarity pattern of the moral struggle. We can avoid privileging the paradoxical line of interpretation by highlighting the elements of bivalency. Yet it is important not sim- ply to reverse priorities but to clarify how the two paradigms comple- ment and enhance while at the same time remaining distant and crit- ical of one another in stemming from a doxa which uses the fox as a symbol of illusion. The convergence between the perspectives is based on the call for overcoming illusion that must occur within the bounds of the causal process. A demythological approach regards</page><page sequence="52">308 STEVEN HEINE the fox not as a being that literally possesses people but as a trans- personal icon, or an open-ended, polysemous sign that allows for the complex crossing over and mediation between otherwise severed or facilely identified conceptual realms. After all, the Jenshi chuan narrator has scolded Cheng for failing to take his tragic love affair with a vixen as an opportunity to investigate the boundary - the discrepancies as well as commonalities - between spirits and hu- mans. The movement between realms operates on several interlocking levels: intra-psychic, intra- and inter-sectarian, and intertextual. The first level refers to the psychological movement between two sides of Pai-chang. The identity of the "former master" is a reflec- tion of the current master's encounter with his own attachments and arrogance in presuming that he is immune to karma. This corresponds to the way images of mythical time and space (e.g., Yoshifuji's thirteen years and the dissolution of his mansion) are evoked in folktales. As in the narrative about two Ch'iens in Wu- men-kuan no. 35 discussed above, this conceit allows for a displace- ment of the fundamental existential problem onto another person who is mythically portrayed, thus enhancing the cathartic effect by detaching and resolving the interior event in terms of externalized circumstances. Pai-chang, in a timeless moment, is in dialogue with and liberating himself, or that part that is symbolized by fox posses- sion, and Huang-po's slap completes and confirms an act of contri- tion for his misunderstanding. The second level of conceptual movement pertains to Zen's intra- and inter-sectarian ideological exchange with other Buddhist, Taoist, Shinto, and folk religious sects and cults. By deploying the imagery of spirit possession, the koan is at once able to borrow and usurp as well as to disdain and dispel the animistic elements used by rival ideologies. This can be characterized as a process of hegemonic functionality in that Zen discourse establishes dominance by domes- ticating the otherness of local cults and showing its own superiority in manipulating and controlling what is threatening and disruptive. Zen and indigenous religions coexist in a competitive relation, a kind of chess game in which the "winner" is often based on ritual efficacy (orthopraxy) rather than theological consistency (ortho- doxy). This is not necessarily a hostile competition but an ongoing</page><page sequence="53">THE WILD FOX KOAN 309 process of assimilation marked by compromise and accommodation as much as by conflict and contrast. Zen, like other forms of Bud- dhism, has had to learn to outplay indigenous cults at their own game, thereby taking on some of their features, while also trying to indoctrinate their followers with Buddhist values. There have been three main attitudes in recent scholarship toward evaluating the lines of continuity or discontinuity, com- patibility or incompatibility that emerge in a consideration of medieval Zen's hegemonic functionality. Two attitudes tend to fol- low a two-tiered model, while the third seeks to go beyond the methodological impasse which this model tends to generate. The first attitude interprets the relation between the discourses concern- ing sacred space in Zen iconoclastic philosophy and in sacramental religiosity by pointing, according to Bernard Faure's sophisticated poststructural hermeneutic, not "to an opposition between two juridically or socially distinct parties, but rather to what Lyotard would call a diff6rend between incommensurable perceptions and un- equal uses of the same space.""5 This approach does not intend its reference to "unequal uses" to imply a hierarchical judgment, and it resembles Bourdieu's view of a "dual reading" as well as LaFleur's view of koans and setsuwa as parallel but innately separate discourses. Yet, it tends to follow a two-tiered standpoint which sees Zen's interface with popular religion occurring along an epistemo- logical "fault line" that represents the corruption of an essentially incorruptible, un-popular religion. For Faure, Zen's anti-super- naturalist rhetoric suggests an evasiveness of the sect's origins whereby "(t)he opaque, ambivalent, at times dangerous world of folk religion has been dispelled by the clear, haughty vision of the en- lightened mind. " "6 This approach, if applied to the fox koan, which Faure discusses in several instances, shows how popular religiosity was decoded and domesticated in the narrative of Pai-chang liberat- ing the ancient monk. But it may not adequately describe how the muted structure contributes to the overall Zen view of karmic retribution and release. The tendency to focus on the heterological dimension may overlook Derrida's notion of diff6rance implying "to 115 Faure, Chan Insights and Oversights, p. 170; see also Faure, The Rhetoric of Immediacy, p. 311. 116 Faure, "Space and Place in Chinese Religious Traditions," p. 350.</page><page sequence="54">310 STEVEN HEINE defer" as well as "to differ," which represents a different view of difference than Lyotard's, one that leaves the door open to the inter- secting aspects of, rather than the inevitable gap between, compet- ing discourses. The approach at the other end of the spectrum emphasizes that Zen and popular religions form a harmonious continuum without ideological conflict or compromise. In discussing the relation be- tween the monastic ideal of indifference to material rewards and the practice of medieval Japanese Soto masters in rituals contributing to worldly benefits (genze riyaku) for the general populace, William Bodiford in a finely detailed textual study argues that these elements may appear "somehow incompatible. However, the opposite can be just as true. In the eyes of rural laymen the power of Buddhist pray- ers was enhanced by the ritual and meditative practice of the monks. "1'7 Similarly, Neill McFarland's examination of the various roles played by images of Bodhidharma in Japanese society as both a representative of sublime meditation and an object of devotion and prayers finds continuity and consistency in the paradoxically linked mythical and demythical levels of discourse: "Thus, the con- ventional interpretation of Daruma, so rigidly stereotyped, is clear- ly an iconographic tradition; but it is not wholly an aberration . . . It is an iconoclastic iconography or an iconographic iconoclasm. " 118 This ap- proach, if applied to the koan, stresses a homological compatibility between internal spirituality and exorcistic ritual. Yet, by emphasiz- ing that the high tradition uses popular religiosity to do its bidding, it may represent a two-tiered model that too readily reconciles con- tradictory materials. By diffusing any sense of difference, it fails to analyze the mutual transformation of divergent paradigms. Therefore, the first approach stresses heterological antithesis while the second approach highlights homological synthesis. The third, compromise position emphasizes syncretism, which is an unsystematic amalgamation of multiple perspectives encompassing shifting alliances and lines of divergence rather than a combination, harmonious or otherwise, of two different elements."9 The starting 117 Bodiford, Soto Zen in Medieval Japan, p. 117. 118 H.

Robert Gimello comments on a Zen devotee's sense of turmoil about enjoying visionary ex- periences on Wu-t'ai-shan despite the Lin-chi lu's admonitions against pilgrimages since the real Manijusri is located not on the mountaintop but within the heart: The appearance of conflict between such things was noted widely during the Sung - for example, between the sober rationalism of literati culture or the disenchanting and demythologizing tendencies of Ch'an Buddhism, on the one hand, and the "otherworldly," visionary bent of those forms of Chinese Buddhism more charac- teristic of earlier times, on the other, or, just as often, between interior religious cul- tivation and exterior religious display.'20 In addition, Faure's approach, which is quite complex, also sug- gests that "Chan adepts may find themselves on the threshold between learned and popular culture when they interpret in a 'spiritual' or 'allegorical' sense legends that they do not completely disbelieve." According to Faure, "rather than an opposition - even if dialectical - or a fusion between Chan and local or popular religion, or between Chan and official religion, we can observe an in- tertwining of - or a transferential relationship among - antagonis- tic or analogous segments of each of these religious traditions. "121 Extending the observations of Gimello and Faure in light of Barthesian semiotics and Bourdieu's social theory, I argue that the compromise approach shows how Zen was affected by popular re- ligion in that both derive from a common but dispersed and poly- semous doxic background of fox imagery, whereby one person or one text participates in two or more discourses or two or more dis- courses are simultaneously expressed in a single person or text.'22 man, Earthwatch, March/April (1995), pp. 6-8, based on their book Holy Water (Charlottes- ville: University of Virginia Press, 1994). 120 Gimello, "Chang Shan-ying on Wu-t'ai Shan," p. 119. 121 Faure, The Rhetoric of Immediacy, pp. 93, 95. In his works Faure considers a river model with tributaries flowing into a central source as well as a rhizome model with multiple horizon- tal roots, among others. 122 I recognize that there are other methods for overcoming the two-tiered model, includ- ing an inversion of the conventional hierarchy and the addition of a third, perhaps intermedi-</page><page sequence="56">312 STEVEN HEINE Thus the debate between homological and heterological interpreta- tions is resolvable in terms of seeing a third level of conceptual move- ment as an intertextual transference, or a movement between fluid, interdependent texts rather than independent sects that is in turn multilevelled. The intertextual interaction of universal and local traditions forges an ideological compatibility and viability based on shared moral concerns. Yet, intertextuality is also a crit- ical, creative tension between discourses that does not culminate in either a differend or an unmediated continuum, but is based on the continuing give-and-take that is at once mutually supportive and subversive. This is a process of accommodation/sublimation whereby Zen allows the folklore view to express itself while continual- ly inverting and diverting its meaning. Therefore it is necessary to develop an analysis not from the stand- point of how Zen trickles down to popular religion or how popular religion trickles up to Zen - both views fall into the pattern of a bi- nary opposition - but in terms of the struggle between perspectives conceived on a horizontal playing field. According to James Berlin, "Rhetorics are usually born in conflict, representing formulations of competing ideological positions. Language is always a major are- na of contention, with competing groups attempting to claim owner ship of the 'true' methods of speaking and writing. 1 '23 The place or topos of the intertextual encounter is language, the harbinger of meaning. The koan, a linguistic "snapshot" of the ongoing process of recording oral dialogues that convey the encounter between tradi- tions, reflects not just two but several levels of interconnected tex- tual and meta-textual (institutional) paradigms, at times overlap- ary tier. Also, some social theorists as well as historians of East Asian religions argue for inter- preting popular culture, or popular religion, as popular culture or religion without presuppos- ing a dichotomy and thus the superiority of the high traditions. See, for example, such diverse works as Michel de Certeau, The Writing of History, trans. Tom Conley (New York: Colum- bia University Press, 1984), p. 184; and Stephen Teiser, The Ghost Festival in Medieval China (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988), pp. 214-16. However, my aim is to view the relation or encounter between philosophy and popular religion as relation in a way that is fair to both sides. As Gurevich suggests, "For simply stating that paganism was fused with Chris- tianity or that Christianity was superficially assimilated hardly explains the character of early medieval popular culture," in Medieval Popular Culture, p. 75. 123 James A.

For example, the k6an reflects the following elements. First, there is the rhetoric of anti-supernaturalism, in which commentaries often disavow and mock the claims of supernatural beliefs from a transcendental perspective and use the term wild fox as a rhetorical device indicating unenlightenment. In addition, there is the prac- tice of amalgamation, by which indigenous spirits like the fox are integrated into the mainstream religious and ritual structure by en- shrinement in temple compounds and their images are also woven into koan narratives and other forms of literature and art to create a moral message. The final element is the legacy of exorcism, in which sacred images are seen as having a demonic, malevolent potential which, when improperly unleashed, requires a ritual that purifies and transforms its power into a Buddhist framework, through ritual that is either homeopathic (using one image of the fox to defeat another fox image) or non-homeopathic (using symbols antithetical to indigenous fox worship, such as traditional Buddhist divinities or chants). In the intersection of these standpoints, shift- ing alliances between opposing standpoints mediated by the poly- semy of bivalent imagery continually emerge and regress. For exam- ple, the philosophical paradigm embraces anti-supernaturalism as well as assimilationism, and the popular religious paradigm en- compasses both exorcism and devotionalism. Furthermore, anti- supernaturalism and exorcism which are diametrically opposed in epitomizing iconoclastic philosophy and sacramental religiosity re- spectively converge at the point of disarming and banishing the harmful effects of the demonic fox. Both are a form of domestication and even though anti-supernaturalism considers itself able to tame exorcism it does so in a way that is influenced and determined by the very structure it seeks to suppress, which is reflected in its alli- ance with assimilationism. Thus, there are two levels of bivalency: the level of the fox image representing the dual possibilities of protec- tion and deception, redemption and betrayal, good and evil; and the level of the Buddhist approach which is both for and against, as- similative and purificatory of and by the fox. Therefore, the phrase "wild fox" harboring a double structure anti-supernatural/supernatural, overt/muted - encompasses multi- ple levels, including metaphysical paradox, in which the negative</page><page sequence="58">314 STEVEN HEINE implications outweigh but are ultimately equalized with the posi- tive, and mythical bivalency, in which positivity and negativity co- exist with the former transforming the latter. The term also contains an inverted structure when it is evoked in a positive way that over- rides the derisive implications as in praise of someone's spiritual freedom or wildness; a reverse structure in that apparent heroes Pai-chang and Huang-po become the objects of criticism rather than admiration so that negativity prevails; and a de-structuring because the folktale of possession-exorcism contains the seeds of its own demythologization when understood as a process of cathartic displacement which defeats a fixation on either positive or negative meanings. Where do the k6an commentators stand in regard to the issue of belief, suspension of disbelief, or cynical compromise with super- naturalism? On the one hand, they emphasize that the way to over- come the fox-as-ignorance is to adopt a stance of nonattachment and nondiscrimination which views causality and non-causality from the standpoint of a paradoxical equality. At the same time they stress that the misuse or false sense of identity which derives from a failure to discriminate causality and non-causality results in nothing other than . . ."wild fox Zen."124 An intriguing waka-style com- mentary by Daiko also sees the fox as a symbol of enlightenment: The thought Of renouncing the world Is awakened; By the time this state has been attained, The fox is still there.'25 Yet, the verse is ambiguous due to the fundamental bivalency of su- pernatural imagery and it may be interpreted to mean that the fox is a perpetual threat which, like karmic causality, never vanishes even for an enlightened person. The aim of the commentaries is to remain non-committal on the issue of supernaturalism while using the images of the fox spirit or fox drool ironically from the standpoint of an enlightenment ex- 124 Akizuki, Mumonkan o yomu, p. 183. 125 Cited in Yasutani Hakuun, Mumonkan (Shunjufsha, 1965), p. 43.</page><page sequence="59">THE WILD FOX KOAN 315 perience that lies beyond and yet meaningfully explores the multiple implications of these terms. Many of the levels of meaning are con- tained in Fa-cheng's verse commentary on the turning word, pu-mei yin-kuo, "not falling into causality": On seeing a wild fox in person, Pai-chang granted his request most willingly; Now I have to ask my monks, Have you spit out fox drool or not?'26 Appendix TRANSLATION OF WU-MEN-KUAN NO. 2 "PAI-CHANG AND THE WILD FOX"127 Whenever Zen master Huai-hai of Mt.

One day, however, he stayed behind. Pai-chang asked who he was. The old man responded, "I am really a non- human (C. fi-jen, J. hinin).129 A long time ago, in the age of Buddha Kasyapa,'30 I was head monk on this very mountain. It happened 126 Cited in SH II:237-38; also in HTC 115:113. 127 The title of the case in other collections is "Great Cultivation" or "Not Obscuring Causality"; see fn. 21. 128 Pai-chang's (720-814) traditional biography is contained in the following texts: Tsu- t'ang chi c. 14; Ching-te chuan-teng lu c. 6; Wu-teng hui-yuian (J. Goto egen) c. 3; and Hsu kao-seng-chuan (J. Zoku kosoden) c. 10. The disciple of Ma-tsu, the second generation patriarch after sixth patriarch Hui-neng, Pai-chang was the teacher of Huang-po, who became Lin- chi's teacher. These four masters of the Hung-chou lineage constitute one of the most important lineages in the early period of Zen in China, as recorded in the Ssu-chiayu- lu. Pai-chang's teachings are collected in two recorded sayings text, and he is also credited with the first Zen monastic code, the Ch'an-men kuei-shih (J. Zenmon kishiki). 129 The termfei-jen (J. hinin) is the translation of the Sanskrit term for non-human beings, amanusya, and in Sino-Japanese it also refers to a shapeshifter or bakemono; the term has also long been used as an epithet for outcasts and marginal groups. 130 Kasyapa is the sixth of seven primordial buddhas culminating in Sakyamuni, who is also considered the first patriarch of Zen. Thus, his era refers to a mythical period prior to the historical Buddha, obviously long before Buddhism was ever actually preached on Mt. Pai- chang in China.</page><page sequence="60">316 STEVEN HEINE that one day a disciple asked me, 'Does even a person of great cultiva- tion (C. ta-hsiu-hsing, J. daishugyd)'3' fall into causality,'32 or not?' I answered, 'Such a person does not fall into causality (C. pu-loyin- kuo, J. furaku inga).' For five hundred lifetimes after that, I have been transfigured into a wild fox (C. yeh-hu, J. yako) body. Now I be- seech you for a turning word (C. i-chuan-yii, J. ittengo)'33 that will hopefully release me from this wild fox transfiguration." The old man then asked, "Does even a person of great cultivation fall into causality, or not?" Pai-chang answered, "Such a person does not obscure causality (C. pu-meiyin-kuo, J. fumai inga)."'34 On hearing this, the old man attained awakening and he said, "I am now released from the wild fox transfiguration, and [my fox corpse] will be found on the other side of the mountain. I humbly request that you bury it with the rites accorded a deceased monk." Pai-chang instructed the monk in charge of rules (C. wei-na, J. ina ON, Skt. karmaddna) to strike the clapper'35 and announce the burial of a deceased monk after the midday meal. The other monks were surprised and wondered, "Who could this be as all of us are healthy and there is no one sick in the Nirvana Hall?''136 After the meal, Pai-chang led the group to the foot of a large rock on the far side of the mountain, and he used his staff to uncover the dead body of a 13' The phrase refers to an enlightened person who continues to practice meditation dili- gently after the attainment of enlightenment. 132 Causality (C. yin-kuo, J. inga) is the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit hetu-phala, which refers to the universal principle of the necessary relation between original or root cause and end result. In Sino-Japanese Buddhism this term also implies the moral process of karmic determination and retribution, whereby a good cause begets a good result and an evil cause begets an evil result. 133 The "turning word" is referred to in numerous places, including the Lin-chi lu, the records of Hung-chih, and the Shobogenzo zuimonki. While never clearly defined in these texts, it seems to refer to the use of a terse utterance - a phrase or a single word - which can in- spire a revolution in one's thinking that results in a liberation experience. 134 "Not obscuring causality" is the literal rendering which I think is most effective here, but it could also be rendered as "not blind to causality" or turned into an affirmative con- struction as "remains subject or bound to causality." In the latter case, "not falling into causality" could be turned into a construction such as "becomes free from causality." 135 In the Zen monastic system, the monk in charge of rules strikes an octagonal anvil with an octagonal hammer signifying an event about to take place in the institution. 136 This refers to the infirmary, for which the name makes an association between nirvadna as the termination of mundane existence and illness/death as the end of life.</page><page sequence="61">THE WILD FOX KOAN 317 wild fox. The fox was cremated in accord with Buddhist funeral rites. 137 That evening during his sermon in the lecture hall Pai-chang told the monks the whole story. Thereupon Huang-po'38 asked, "The old man was transfigured into a wild fox for five hundred lifetimes because he used an incorrect turning word. What would have hap- pened if his turning word had not been incorrect?" Pai-chang re- plied, "Come up here and I'll tell you." After hesitating, Huang- po approached Pai-chang and slapped him. Pai-chang, clapping his hands and laughing, exclaimed, "I thought the barbarian had a red beard, but here is another red-bearded barbarian!"'39 Prose Commentary "Not falling into causality" - why was he transfigured into a wild fox?

The writings attributed to him include the Chuan- hsin fa-yao (J. Denshin hoyo). 139 The "red-bearded barbarian" generally refers to foreigners and in Zen rhetoric implies the bearded Bodhidharma, the twenty-eighth Zen patriarch and first in China, who "came from the west (India). " The term is also used as a duplicitous insult/praise. The word for bar- barian (C. hu, J. ko) is a homophone for fox, and the Ts'ung-jung lu version refers to "red- bearded fox." 140 The "single eye" referred to here is of course not corporeal but the eye of Dharma or of nondualistic insight. 141 In some translations there is a more explicit reference to the "enjoyment" of the fox in- carnations. 142 This line can be rendered, "Odd and even are on one die," or "Two winning num- bers, one roll of the dice."</page></plain_text>
