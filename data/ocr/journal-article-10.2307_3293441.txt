<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cult and Temple of Jupiter Feretrius THE CULT OF Jupiter Feretrius, con- sidered by the Romans to be the first cult in Rome of the great sky-god of the Indo-Europeans, extends back to the beginning of Roman history and marks the emergence of Rome from an unimportant, agricultural commu- nity to one of prominence within the Latin League. This cult, developing during the period of animism in Roman religion, retained its animistic nature, and the deity never emerged from the state of numen to that of deus. Al- though a temple was later built, it was The second part of the Philebus turns to the individual soul, who is seeking this reality through all its cognitive and appreciative "attitudes and dispo- sitions." At first it is presented as lost in a dark forest frightened by its own imaginations, (38D) until it finally reaches through philosophy its partici- pation in the absolute reality which is self-sufficient and good, in whose eternity it shares. (60) This levelled and dialectical meta- physics forms the background and the real unity of the earlier Aristotelian Metaphysics, as I have shown else- where.* This Platonic vision of reality in Aris- totle's Metaphysics culminates in the famous statements of the twelfth book, where reality is described as the ab- solute, self-producing, self-distinguish- ing and self-thinking unity, absolute life and actuality. These sentences, in turn, are quoted by Hegel at the end of his Encyclopedia as a summary of his own dialectical metaphysics. GUSTAV E.

SPRINGER sius supports2 the theory that the epi- thet has a connection with ferre, to carry; but Propertius gives as his first choice ferire, when he says, ". . .causa Feretri / omine quod certo dux ferit ense ducem."3 However, the connec- tion of Feretrius with ferire results not from ferire ducem but from foedus ferire, the technical phrase used by the Romans for entering into a treaty, since a sacrifice was offered as con- firmation of the pact.4 Jupiter with the epithet Feretrius was from the earliest days the god in whose name and under whose guidance treaties were estab- lished; and to his cult were assigned the priestly college of Fetials, who ex- ecuted the declaring of wars and the making of treaties. Since Rome's greatest activity was warfare, the po- sition of Jupiter Feretrius in Roman religion and politics was firmly estab- lished, and the cult was not perverted by Greek anthropomorphism. Of all important Roman cults that of Jupiter Feretrius was most successful in re- taining its early Roman animistic na- ture. The first mention of the cult of Jupi- ter Feretrius appears early in Livy's history. After the victory of the Ro- mans over the Caeninenses, who came to avenge the seizure of the Sabine women, Romulus marked off on the Capitoline a sacred enclosure (temp- lum) to Jupiter Feretrius and dedi- cated to him the arms of Acron, the enemy leader whom he had slain.5 It is evident that Livy considers that the cult title Feretrius was created on the spot for the occasion. The sequence of events is the fitting of the spoils on a frame, the depositing of the frame be- side an oak, the establishing of the limits of the sacred enclosure, and fi- nally the bestowing on Jupiter of the cult title Feretrius. Several authors6 besides Livy men- tion Romulus as the first of three gen- erals to dedicate the arms of a slain enemy general (spolia opima) to Jupi- ter Feretrius; but none is quite so explicit as Plutarch, who describes in detail the dedication scene with the attendant triumphal procession.7 The most important statement for the study of the origin of this cult is Livy's remark that Romulus deposited the spolia opima beside an oak, "which the shepherds hold sacred."8 Of all European trees the oak was considered by the Indo-Europeans to be especially sacred, and it is natural that the most important god (the father) of the Indo- Europeans should be identified with this most sacred tree.9 The oak as the dwelling of the numen of Jupiter fits the early animistic period of Roman religion; and it is in that period that there began the practice of bestowing titles on Jupiter, which finally reached a total of more than one hundred. This complicated system of cult titles was a logical result of Rome's expanding role in world affairs; for Jupiter, the su- preme god, was needed in the varied activities and responsibilities of the Roman state. If, for example, he was called upon to stay the rout of the Ro- man armies, he could be invoked by the title Stator, as Romulus is said to have done. 10 In the development of the cult of Jupiter Feretrius the first stage was, as we have seen, the identification of the numen with the oak. The next step was reputed to have been taken by Romulus when he measured off a sa- cred area beneath the tree.11 In this enclosure was probably placed an altar. Although an altar is not mentioned here by Livy, Propertius refers to one in connection with the later temple.12 The final stage was the building of the temple. It has been assumed by some that an actual structure was implied in Livy's words " . .. templumque his regioni- bus, quas modo animo metatus sum, dedico . . ."13 Burn describes it as a "diminutive chapel"14 and implies that it, along with other public buildings, was built of tufa with wooden supports. The word which Livy uses, templum, strictly means a place marked off by the augur's staff, a sacred enclosure or 28</page><page sequence="3">THE CULT AND TEMPLE OF JUPITER FERETRIUS sanctuary. It is that meaning which Livy obviously intends when he refers to Romulus' dedicating spolia opima. However, in Livy's next reference to the cult of Jupiter Feretrius a diffi- culty arises. He says that Ancus Mar- cius enlarged the temple (aedis) in recognition of his success against Poli- torium, one of the Latin cities.15 The use of the words aedis and amplificata indicates that Livy believed that an actual temple structure had been built sometime before the second half of the seventh century. It is very unlikely that a temple, as we know it, existed in Rome before the height of the Etrus- can influence. Probably the develop- ment of the cult of Jupiter Feretrius followed the usual pattern of other Ro- man cults: (1) the assigning of an area sacred to the numen, (2) the build- ing of a sacellum, which Festus de- fines vaguely as "a place sacred to the gods without a roof,"16 and (3) the building of a temple. Even the Greek god Apollo, who was introduced early into Rome, followed this Roman pat- tern. The "temple" which, Livy says, was enlarged by Ancus Marcius was un- doubtedly a sacellum or an area walled in with stone17 sacred to Jupiter Fere- trius. This was the only requirement for the dwelling of the early Roman deities since they had not been per- sonalized by this time. When the Ro- man deities began to assume human characteristics, then temples had to be built to satisfy one basic human need, shelter. Varro says that the Ro- mans did not have statues of their gods for more than one hundred and seventy years;18 and it is reasonable to believe that no temple was built in Rome until the end of the regal period, at which time the great temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva was con- structed at the instigation of the Etrus- can kings.19 Varro hints at a foreign influence in the established religion when he sharply criticizes those who brought in statues for having removed religious fear and having added error. According to Livy Romulus set the precedent for the dedication of spoils to Jupiter Feretrius by limiting it to a general who had killed an enemy gen- eral in battle, and Livy adds that this restriction kept the fame of such a gift from being made common by a number sharing in it.20 The dedication by Rom- ulus of spolia opima was a favorite subject in antiquity, Ovid says that this scene was displayed on the door of the temple of Mars Ultor,21 and in 1913 a painting of Romulus shouldering the spoils of Acron was found on the Via dell' Abbondanza in Pompeii.22 Also, in the forum of Pompeii was found an elogium to Romulus.23 According to Servius24 and Festus25 it was stated in Numa's laws that spolia opima should be dedicated to Jupiter Feretrius. Livy does not men- tion this specific part of Numa's laws, but refers only to the laws in general.26 During the long history of the cult only three generals dedicated spoils: Romu- lus, Aulus Cornelius Cossus, and Mar- cus Claudius Marcellus. Cossus dedicated the arms and armor of Lars Tolumnius, king of Veii, either in 437 B.C. or 422 B.C.27 Livy says that he followed all previous historians in stating that Cossus was a tribune of the soldiers when he dedicated the spolia opima in 437 B.C.,28 and later29 he also states that the dedication took place when Cossus was tribunus mili- tum. However, in a passage30 which was obviously inserted later, Livy cor- rects the date to 422 B.C., the year Cossus was consul. He says that Augus- tus entered the temple of Jupiter Fere- trius while it was being repaired and saw the inscription on the linen breast- plate taken from Lars Tolumnius, which proved conclusively that Cossus was consul at the time. It was con- venient for Augustus to "discover" this inscription because it was a means of refusing Marcus Licinius Crassus the honor of dedicating the spoils of the Bastarnian Deldo.31 At that time (27 B.C.) Crassus was proconsul, and by proving that Cossus was consul. Au- 29</page><page sequence="4">LAWRENCE A. SPRINGER gustus was able to show that all three men who had dedicated spoils previ- ously were supreme commanders. The incident has been generally accepted without comment although one explan- ation has been attempted-that Augus- tus misread a contraction of the name "Cossus" as "consul."32 It is apparent that this is an example of the employ- ment of religion for political interests, a practice certainly not rare in Roman history. It is difficult to believe that the linen breastplate, not to mention the inscription, would survive four cen- turies in a temple which Augustus found to be in almost total ruin. The third and last to dedicate spolia opima to Jupiter Feretrius was Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who in 222 B.C. brought back to Rome the spoils of Virdomarus, the leader of the Insub- rian Gauls.33 Plutarch's description34 of the ceremony indicates that even at this late date the Romans continued to identify Jupiter Feretrius with the oak. The dedication scene is reproduced on the reverse of a denarius, struck about 45 B.C. by Publius Cornelius Tentulus Marcellinus.35 The Senate granted Julius Caesar the privilege of dedicating spolia opima, as if he had slain some enemy general with his own hand,36 but there is no indication that he accepted this honor. Augustus records his own depositing of laurel in Capitolio,37 which we may assume to be the temple of Jupiter Feretrius since Cassius Dio identifies it as such and adds that the dedication was contrary to custom.38 At a time when emphasis was placed on quantity and value of temple offerings, it is noteworthy that the temple of Jupiter Feretrius escaped this trend and main- tained the sanctity of its few religious relics. Besides the three offerings of spolia opima the only sacra kept in the tem- ple were the sceptre and flint stones, which were used in making treaties.39 The sceptre had been used from the earliest days of Greece and Rome to solemnize or to give ultimate force to oaths.40 Commenting on the passage in which Latinus uses the sceptre to ratify the treaty with Aeneas, Servius says that the sceptre represents Jupi- ter holding a sceptre and that the scep- tre alone was used later by the Romans since it was too difficult to take the statue when making treaties with dis- tant peoples.41 This does not provide sufficient evidence for a cult statue of Jupiter Feretrius. Servius is undoubt- edly referring here to the cult statue of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The flint (silex), which the Romans believed to be a thunderbolt, was prob- ably a meteoric stone, which Pliny describes as much in demand for the practice of magic.42 In the beginning there was probably only one such stone,43 but as Roman aggression ex- panded, the number of flint stones in- creased.44 The casting of the stone was the final act of the oath, which was taken not only by representatives of the state, the Fetials, to solemnize a treaty but also by private persons to make an oath binding. The recorded words45 of the oath in connection with treaties are the same as those spoken by Cinna46 when he pledged his alle- giance to Sulla. It is generally accepted that at least the early Romans considered the oak as the dwelling of the numen of Jupiter Feretrius. However, whether the stone was the symbol of the god and as such the god immanent in the stone or whether the stone, like the sceptre, was only a part of the ritualistic ap- paratus of the Fetials is a question about which there has been divided opinion. Aust supports the theory of the god immanent in the stone,47 but Fowler maintains that the existence of a stone in the temple as an object of worship is not clearly attested.48 The most important statement on this prob- lem is given by Servius. He says that the Fetials began using a stone instead of a sword to slay victims "quod antiqui Iovis signum lapidem silicem putaverunt esse."49 Fowler in a strange bit of scholarly maneuvering 30</page><page sequence="5">THE CULT AND TEMPLE OF JUPITER FERETRIUS takes another manuscript reading anti- quum and concludes that Servius only says that the Fetials fancied that the stone was an ancient symbol of Jupiter Feretrius. His other argument, that the existence of several stones in later years shows that silices were only a part of the ritualistic apparatus of the Fetials,50 is as inconclusive as his in- terpretation of Servius. Other evi- dence, although possibly unreliable, of the Romans' identifying Jupiter with the stone is the formula of the oath, "Iovem lapidem iuro"51 It may have implied "Jupiter in the form of a stone" or "Jupiter and the stone."52 Although it cannot be definitely proved that the Romans considered the silex as a symbol of the god, it is certain that the connection between the two, the numen and the silex, was very close. The importance of the cult of Jupiter Feretrius even as late as the first cen- tury B.C. is evidenced by Propertius devoting one elegy to it and by the verse53 which reveals the special place of the cult in the minds of the Romans. A further indication of the position of the cult in Roman religion is indicated by the fact that the temple was among the first twelve to be rebuilt during Au- gustus building operations.54 Alto- gether Augustus restored eighty-two temples, and he adds that not one which needed repair was neglected55 Nepos in his biography of Atticus56 gives the reason for the temple of Ju- piter Feretrius being among the first to be rebuilt. He says that Atticus, whose judgment on matters of Roman history Augustus respected, induced him to repair the temple, which was falling into ruin and was without a roof. This restoration took place about 31 B.C. It is impossible to state definitely when the original temple was built. However, Aust's conjecture57 that Cos- sus constructed the temple, which Au- gustus later restored, deserves consid- eration although it is not supported by any ancient authority. Following the construction of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, which was believed to have been dedicated in the first year of the republic,58 there was consider- able building activity; and it is reason- able to assume that the temple of Ju- piter Feretrius was built, if not by Cossus, at least during the first half of the fifth century B.C. A coin struck about 45 B.C.59 in com- memoration of Marcellus' victory over Virdomarus gives us a general idea of the appearance of the temple before the reconstruction by Augustus. It rep- resents a rectangular temple on a high podium with the four columns support- ing an entablature with a plain pedi- ment.60 Dionysius, writing undoubtedly after the reconstruction of the temple by Augustus, says that ancient traces of the temple still remained in his day and that the longest sides were less than fifteen feet.61 It is inconceivable that either the original or the recon- structed temple was so small. The most likely interpretation of this diffi- cult passage is that the remains of the sacellum, built early in the regal pe- riod, were preserved within the tem- ple, which was constructed sometime during the first half of the fifth cen- tury.62 This temple structure was then rebuilt but not redesigned by Augustus. Since Jupiter Feretrius continued to retain through the centuries his orig- inal animistic nature and since the Ro- mans jealously controlled the dedica- tion of spolia opima and other sacra to this deity, it is understandable that the sacellum, or at least the outline, would be preserved. The Romans al- lowed many of their temples to become veritable museums, but in the case of a few like that of Jupiter Feretrius they did not lose sight of the religious and political significance of the temple offerings. Although Augustus rebuilt the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, the unique posi- tion of the cult in the Roman state was weakened by his dedicating in 20 B.C. the temple of Mars Ultor on the Cap- itoline, which, as Cassius Dio says,63 31</page><page sequence="6">LAWRENCE A. SPRINGER was built to rival that of Jupiter Fere- trius. The visual evidence that Mars Ultor was to assume the position of Jupiter Feretrius is indicated by the fact that Augustus had the scene of Romulus dedicating spolia opima en- graved on the door of the temple of Mars Ultor.64 In it were deposited the Roman standards which Crassus had lost to the Parthians and which Au- gustus had recovered through peaceful negotiations. It is altogether possible that Augustus petitioned the Senate for the privilege of dedicating these stand- ards to Jupiter Feretrius in order to rank along with the three who had dedicated spolia opima. Cassius Dio comments that Augustus considered the standards as won from the Par- thians rather than returned by them. Elsewhere he says that Augustus de- posited laurel in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius and adds that the dedication was contrary to custom.65 It is prob- able that Augustus, not wishing to an- ger the Senate and maintaining his policy of reconciliation, did not pursue his request. Rather he sought to trans- fer the functions of Jupiter Feretrius to Mars Ultor, and in this he was suc- cessful, for we hear no more about the cult after the year 20 B.C. LAWRENCE A.
