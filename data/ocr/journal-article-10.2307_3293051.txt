<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS In four chapters the author presents fea- tures of Galen's life, the transmission of his writings, Greek and Arabic textual problems, and interesting sidelights on the history of Greek philosophy, especially as related to the Church of the latter part of the second cen- tury. A philosopher as well as a physician, Galen was also acquainted with Jews and Chris- tians. He approved their manner of life, but denounced their uncritical acceptance of the authority of Scriptural revelation. This criticism of Jewish belief may go back as far as Hecataeus of Abdera. Galen's views in these matters are similar to those of Paul of Samosata, and others whom Catholic Christianity has classed as heretics. It is stated that Christians were in- terested primarily in virtue, rather than truth, whereas Galen put truth first. Religion for him, as for Greek intelligentsia generally, had become intellectualized. The reader may well question whether Christians have not shifted their interest from virtue to doctrine. It seems to be Judaism, rather than Chris- tianity, that preserved the primacy of ethical interest. Doctrinal interest, however, is to be dis- tinguished from the intellectual interest of the Greek philosopher. Certain Christian writers strongly attacked non-Christian Greek culture; and they did so largely be- cause Greek intellectuals had attacked Chris- tianity's major premise. "Premises" is more correct. Tertullian said, "We want no curious disputation when we possess Jesus Christ, no intellectual inquiry when we enjoy the Gospel!" Galen is presented as "the first Greek philosopher who, without becoming a Chris- tian himself, gave a fair and sympathetic appreciation of the Christians for philosophic reasons." He considered myths and miracles useful instruments of mass education, for producing right belief, even if by non-rational conviction. At Rome, at the end of the second cen- tury, there had developed a rapprochement between Christianity and the cultured classes. One factor in this situation was Galen. J.

THE WORK UNDER REVIEW is a doctoral dis- sertation of the University of Amsterdam. It contains an Introduction, Latin text, Dutch translation, and extensive commentary of Letters 117 and 18, of the Augustinian corpus. A summary in English is given after the commentary. The author is evidently a student of great industry and has tried hard to give a useful work to the public. This reviewer feels that his attempt has, in general, been successful. Yet, it would be hard to give unreserved agreement to all the statements or conclusions of the author. The field of Augustinology is a vast one, and it is exceedingly difficult for one person to master all the materials needed for a complete understanding of his profound thought. Dr. Koopmans should not, therefore be harshly criticized if there are gaps in his commentary. These gaps are especially evi- dent in philosophical sections of the com- mentary, where the author is much less capable than in the linguistic sections. In the refusal to identify Dioscorus with the physician, Dioscurus of Hippo, Koopmans is more convincing. To a student of Augustine's thought, some of Koopmans' generalizations are amazing: for instance, the statements in the summary (p. 237) that Augustine "hates the Greeks" and that his ethics are not free from some anthropomorphic eudemonism. Had Koop- mans read Charles Boyer's Saint Augustin in the series "Les Moralistes Chretiens," he would not have fallen into such a hopeless error. Augustine's statement about the ac- cessibility of abstract truth to the intellect alone (683, 20-2I) is a far cry from Koop- 205</page><page sequence="2">JOHN J. GAVIGAN mans' statement that the senses "fail in their judgment about things perceived" (p. 238). Both Gilson and Bourke have clear explana- tions of Augustine's thought on this point. Occasionally Koopmans assumes that he improves upon Augustine's interpretations of Cicero. But just how he does so is not clear. Yet, I do not wish to leave an unfavorable impression of the work as a whole. It has many useful points, especially on the linguis- tic side. The bibliography contains nearly all the necessary works for a study of Letters 117 and II8. JOHN J. GAVIGAN, O.S.A.

THOUGH THE MAJOR PROBLEMS of our time are philosophical, the formal study of philosophy makes little appeal to American students. They seem to require a less abstract approach, such as may be found, for example, in literature. In this book, therefore, Professor Ross turns to the drama, the novel, and the poem in the attempt to present philosophical concepts more concretely. In the opening chapter philosophy is intro- duced as a natural activity of the human mind and distinguished from other disci- plines, notably science. In Chapters II-V ethics is discussed, as the problem most immediate to the student's own interests and closest in its relationship to literature. The hedonism of the Cyrenaics and Epicureans; the later Stoicism of the Roman Empire; the rational approach developed by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; and Christian ethics, illustrated largely from Dante's Divine Comedy, acquaint the reader with funda- mentally differing points of view and pos- sible modifications of them. In Chapters VI-VIII metaphysics is attempted. The problem of appearance and reality and the problem of the organization of the universe are treated; optimism and pessimism as philosophical concepts are considered; and the book ends with a review of the problem of evil. In presenting his material Professor Ross maintains a high level of excellence. He shows unusual ability in drawing helpful examples from everyday life, in summarizing literary works, and in characterizing historical periods briefly and effectively. In his introductions to the various problems he treats, he is clear and straight-forward; and in evaluating con- flicting points of view he holds the balances very fairly. But it is his skilful application of literary material to philosophical problems that lends its particular flavor to the book. The material itself varies in richness from topic to topic, but it is almost always very good, and in only two instances could its illustrative value possibly be questioned: once in the passage on appearance and reality (133-143), where Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author seems as difficult as the problem it is intended to illustrate; and once in the discussion of the materialistic concept of the universe (i 50-I59), where Lucretius in English prose condensation appears almost, if not quite, indistinguishable from formal philosophic writing. But the book as a whole indicates unmistakably the real possibilities of the method adopted. There are a few specific points. In the discussion of Epicureanism there is no men- tion of the ideal of friendship so characteristic of the sect. At the end of the presentation of Aristotelian ethics there is a confusing pas- sage (103-104) dealing with student reactions to the doctrine of the Mean. Static perfection, condemned in connection with the Christian concept of Heaven (20o), appears to be pre- sented sympathetically in connection with Keats' Ode on a Grecian Urn (90-91). The name of "the long war" (72) that ruined Athens is not given tbe reader. There are a number of unfortunate misprints, for which the author is not to blame. Its rich and varied material and clear, vivid style should assure this book a wide appeal. G. D. PERCY University of Arizona 206</page></plain_text>
