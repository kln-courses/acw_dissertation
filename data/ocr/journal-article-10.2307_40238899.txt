<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas Pringle and the 'Xhosa' Matthew Shunt "Early nineteenth century liberalism," writes Timothy Keegan, "was pro- foundly ambiguous. Its rhetorical commitment to the legal formalities of equality and freedom was in sharp contrast to its fundamental compati- bility with cultural imperialism, class domination and, ultimately, racial subjugation" (1996, 13). Keegan's achievement is to demonstrate how deeply embedded in material practice this liberal tradition was. In its initial phase the interests of conscience (the missionaries and humanitarians) and capital (the merchants) coincided, insofar as both parties sought economic modernisation in the form of anti-monopolistic free trade and an unre- strained access to 'free' labour through the abolition of slavery. Paradox- ically, the very success of the mercantile-humanitarian alliance steadily diminished the influence of the humanitarian cause and contributed sub- stantially to its 'failure'; settler capitalism increasingly resorted to forms of legalistic servitude in order to compel a refractory indigenous labour force to perform the tasks that peonage and slavery had previously forced upon them. As the settler economy grew stronger and more organised, so the voice of the humanitarians faded. The public career of John Fairbairn, Pringle's closest friend and longtime associate, bears testimony to the attenuation of this tradition. By the time of the War of the Axe in 1846-7 the vilified liberal of the 1820s and 30s was a wealthy and influential newspaper editor as well as Chairman of The South African Mutual Insur- ance Society (later to become The Old Mutual). Fairbairn had become a vehement militarist and insisted that the Xhosa be "put down or expelled, though it should require some 10,000 troops to accomplish it ... not vic- tory but conquest is to be the end of this outbreak" (1996, 216). As Keegan observes, the fact that Fairbairn's Company had a considerable investment in mortgages in the eastern districts "might explain in part Fairbairn's new interest in the clearing of Xhosaland" (1996, 216). What, one wonders, would his devoted friend Pringle have made of this? English in Africa 27 No. 2 (October 2000)</page><page sequence="2">2 MATTHEW SHUM Whether or not one accepts Keegan's damning judgement that humanitar- ianism "turned out to be a shallow, tawdry, deceptive thing" (1996, 127), there is no escaping the fact that humanitarianism very soon lost its ide- alism, and that this was not an unhappy accident. The colonial bourgeoisie who fought off the excesses of a remnant Tory autocracy and the 'feudal' pastoralism of the Boers did so not in the name of anti-colonialism but of further colonialism: a modernising, 'disciplinary' colonialism whose sub- jugations, while less crude, were a lot more pervasive.1 Pringle's period in South Africa, as well as his early death in England in 1834, meant that he lived and wrote in humanitarianism's age of innocence in which it had yet openly to confront its complicity in the systems which it decried, or to conceive how a humanitarian colonialism would operate once its own terms had been achieved. Yet it is possible to discern large, and sometimes disabling, contradictions in Pringle's writings, especially when one brings the prose and the poetry into the adjacence for which they were originally intended. As I shall at least partially argue here, such contradictions should be regarded as integral rather than incidental to his writings. There has been an ongoing tendency to pluck Pringle out of the "empty, homoge- nous time" (Benjamin 1977, 263) of South African history and claim him as a progenitorial liberal figure, 'founding' and hence legitimising a cer- tain lineage of discursive resistance to the various oppressions of South African history.2 Within the limited and somewhat preliminary scope of this paper, in which I concentrate on the differing representations of the Xhosa in Pringle's prose and poetry, my intention is to argue for a more circumscribed view of Pringle, in which his inheritance is altogether more equivocal and not so easily récupérable into narratives of liberal redemp- tion. Pringle's Narrative of a Residence was first published in London in 1 834, where it formed part two of a volume entitled African Sketches. Part one consisted of the Poems Illustrative of South Africa. In a preface to the original edition, Pringle justified this "unusual combination of verse and prose" (Pereira &amp; Chapman 1989, 138) on the grounds that they were mutually complementary, and compared the two parts to Siamese twins "bound together .... by a ligature which perhaps may appear equally unnecessary and unnatural. Yet . . . will be found, on closer examination, to be of a nature so intimate, that it could scarcely be dissevered without endangering the vitality of the separate parts" (1989, 138). This is a slightly grotesque metaphor since unseparated Siamese twins either die or survive as freaks, and one must assume that this is not the fate Pringle</page><page sequence="3">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 3 intended for his book. At any rate, Pringle's plea has not been heeded, and the two parts of African Sketches have never again been published as one. The Poems Illustrative of South Africa, however, have been published four times this century in South Africa, the most recent edition being in 1989, with an edition before then in 1970; individual poems have also fre- quently been anthologised. By contrast the Narrative has been published only once in a 1966 special edition which is now a collectors' item and available only in specialised libraries. An abridged version was published by Longman in 1970, edited by John Wahl, but its principles of selection succeed in excising almost all those passages, and a number of chapters, in which Pringle deals with politically and racially contentious issues. Ironically, in the nineteenth century, the Narrative was reissued five times between 1834 and 1858, and soon after its publication was also translated into German and Dutch. As this publishing history indicates, literary crit- ical reception of Pringle in South Africa has been encouraged to focus strongly on the poetry, and the only extended treatment of the Narrative that I know of is a chapter in John Doyle's book Thomas Pringle published by Twayne in 1972. Doyle is, however, thin on comparative readings. Despite Pringle's assertion that the two parts of African Sketches are intimately bound to one another, their relationship very often seems, from a late twentieth-century perspective, to be somewhat less than seamless. This is especially evident in the representation of the Xhosa. Of the forty or so poems published in Poems Illustrative of South Africa almost a quarter deal directly with the Xhosa and in significant respects the Xhosa are the centrepiece of the poems. By contrast, they are fairly marginal throughout the Narrative, and even a final separate chapter on the Xhosa, along with a similar chapter on the Hottentots and a preceding portion of a chapter on the Bushmen, were written almost a decade after Pringle had left South Africa. These sections of the Narrative, which in some ways revert to the customs and manners treatment typical of the travel genre, also have a polemical intent, especially in the case of the Xhosa. In this chapter Pringle uses the occasion to review Frontier policy in the 1830s, and, as we shall see, to propagandise on behalf of a humanitarian vision of empire. However, the differences between the representation of the Xhosa in the Narrative and the Xhosa in the poetry are not merely generic: they are of an entirely different order. In what follows I concentrate largely on the Narrative, as this is by far the lesser-known text.</page><page sequence="4">4 MATTHEW SHUM Shortly after his arrival at Algoa Bay on South Africa's east coast, Pringle made his first "journey into the interior" to visit the mission sta- tion at Bethelsdorp, "the well known Hottentot village, about nine miles from the coast" (1966, 13). He was accompanied by a "Hottentot boy" who acted as a guide. Pringle describes the boy's dress ("a pair of leather trousers and a loose mantle of sheep skin" [13]) but does not comment on his disposition or on the exchanges, if any, that they had. Pringle found the country in the vicinity of Algoa Bay to present "not, on the whole, a very inviting aspect," singling out in particular a lack of vegetation on the "undulating plains" and the fact that this landscape was "unenlivened" by any signs of human habitation "except such as was afforded" by Hottentot herdsmen with their sheep and cattle (14). The only features which do elicit Pringle's approval are the distant sight of the "lofty and picturesque" Winterhoekberg, the "strange aspect" of some salt pans, and the "exotic appearance" of certain plants. The apparent neutrality of these notations of landscape is, of course, disturbed by a retrospective reading which reveals fairly predictable European expectations. These expectations are considerably aggrandised (and then disappointed) when Pringle finally sights the village of their destination. I came in sight of the village just as the sun was setting. The shadows of the barren hills which rise above it to the westward were falling quietly over the plain. The smoke of the fires just lighted to cook the evening meal of the home-coming herdsmen was curling calmly in the serene evening air. The bleating of flocks returning to the fold, the lowing of the kine to meet their young, and other pleasant rural sounds, recalling to my recollection all the pastoral associations of a Scottish glen, gave a very agreeable effect to my first view of this mis- sionary village. When I entered the place, however, all associ- ations connected with the rural scenery of Europe were at once dispelled. The groups of woolly-haired, swarthy-complexioned natives, many of them still dressed in the old sheep-skin mantle or caross; the swarms of naked or half-naked children, the wig- wam hovels of mud or reeds; the long-legged, large-horned cattle, the broad-tailed African sheep, with hair instead of wool, the strange words of the evening salutation (goeden avond - "good evening"), courteously given, as I passed, by young and old; the uncouth clucking sounds of the Hottentot language, spoken by some of them to each other; these, and a hundred other traits of wild and foreign character, made me</page><page sequence="5">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 5 feel that I was far indeed from the glens of Cheviot, or the pas- toral groups of a Scottish hamlet - that I was at length in the land of the Hottentot. (14-15) One could scarcely hope for a more pointed expression of the Euro- pean desire for a landscape and its people to confirm a paradigm regained, and Pringle's synaesthetic conjuration of a "Scottish glen" in the midst of a landscape he has just described as "sterile" has about it a slightly hallu- cinatory quality, as though his desire is rushing ahead of him, half-creating what it sees. At the same time the "dispelling" of this pastoral vision entails multiple depreciations of the 'Hottentot': hair, skin, dress/undress, childrearing, habitation, language. Even the local stock are somehow imperfect ("hair instead of wool"). These and "a hundred other traits of wild and foreign character" overwhelm Pringle, and so complete is the ruin of his expectations that he pronounces himself in a land ("the land of the Hottentots") far not only from home but from his imagination of what 'home* ought to be. Pringle's unselfconscious assertion of "Europe" as the measure of the human and his disappointment at the Hottentot's manifest failure to meet this measure is ironic when one considers that Bethelsdorp is a missionary village, the product of colonial sociocultural engineering, and not by any means the site of an unmediated indigeneity. The irony is compounded when, a short paragraph later, Pringle describes a "Caffer woman" who is to be "given out in servitude" to a local colonist together with her infant and small daughter. The woman's 'crime' was to be among a group of women who had crossed the lines of demarcation on the Eastern Frontier without permission. Pringle immediately recognises that to be enslaved for this is an act of obvious cruelty. He is also moved to admiration by the woman's account of her situation: Though I did not understand a single word she uttered, I have seldom been more struck with surprise and admiration. The language, to which she gave full and forcible intonation, was highly musical and sonorous; her gestures were natural, graceful and impressive, and her large, dark eyes, and hand- some bronze countenance, were full of eloquent expression. Sometimes she pointed back towards her own country, and then to her children. Sometimes she raised her tones aloud, and shook her clenched hand, as if she denounced our injustice, and threatened us with the vengeance of her tribe. Then again she</page><page sequence="6">6 MATTHEW SHUM would melt into tears, as if imploring clemency, and mourning for her helpless little ones ... I was not a little struck by the scene, and could not help beginning to suspect that my Euro- pean countrymen, who thus made captives of harmless women and children, were in reality greater Barbarians than the savage natives of Caffraria. (15-16) Positioned somewhere between evocation and report, this passage is remarkable (in its context) for its dramatic shifting of the earlier bias against the Hottentot. The Xhosa woman reverses the bad epiphany of the Bethelsdorp dusk, and presents Pringle with an impassioned example of the protest of the "helpless" against "injustice." In addition to the senti- ments it expresses, the passage offers us what one might call a positive aestheticisation of the Xhosa woman (her voice, her eyes, her face); there is no mention of her (un)dress (or that of her children), no hint of any derogation at all. Why, one is tempted to ask, has the Xhosa woman attracted an encomium from Pringle, whereas the hapless Hottentots elicited a somewhat less enthusiastic response? It is tempting here to spec- ulate that Pringle might have retrospectively 'doctored' this passage in order to promote anti-slavery sentiment, but even were this so it does little to alter one's impression that Pringle's responses to his new environment, as one might expect, are marked by a significant degree of instability. For even allowing that Pringle is genuinely moved by the woman, and that he shows a characteristically acute prescience, at this early stage of the Nar- rative, of the porous boundaries between (white) civilisation and (black) savagery, these sympathies and recognitions are qualified by a perceptual volatility that never quite allows anything to stay in any fixed place. Thus, in the very next paragraph, Pringle describes the evening service at the mission: The demeanour of the audience was attentive and devout, and their singing of the missionary hymns was singularly pleasing and harmonious. The effect of the music was no doubt greatly heightened by the reflections which the sight of this African congregation naturally suggested. I saw before me the remnant of an aboriginal race, to whom this remote region, now occu- pied by white colonists, had at no distant period belonged. As I sat and listened to the soft and touching melody of the female voices, or gazed on the earnest, upturned, swarthy counte- nances of the aged men, who had probably spent their early days in the wild freedom of nomadic life, and worn out their</page><page sequence="7">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA1 7 middle life in the service of the colonists, it was pleasing to think that here, and in a few other institutions such as this, the Christian humanity of Europe had done something to alleviate European oppression, by opening asylums where, at least, a few of the race were enabled to escape from personal thraldom, and to emerge from heathen darkness into the glorious light and liberty of the gospel. (16) The Hottentots, gathered in an "African congregation" and performing the devotional rituals of the "Christian humanity of Europe" are, suddenly, much more amenable to a melioristic reading, in which there does at least exist the possibility of their eventual recuperation into "the glorious light and liberty of the gospel." Pringle's invocation of mission Christianity as the still centre of the turbulent colonial world, his insistent italicisation {"here"; "few") of its place and function, reads very much like a deter- mined attempt to impose meaning on what has previously been an extremely recalcitrant context. If in the previous paragraph he faced the prospect of compounded barbarisms ("even greater barbarians"), here he forestalls this by opposing the "Christian humanity of Europe" to "Euro- pean oppression," a form of splitting which bifurcates the colonial subject by setting one form of his historical formation (evangelical humanism) against another (slavery, and with it a whole set of ancien regime political practices). The presence of indigenous "heathen darkness" does not so much disrupt or triangulate this binary as confirm it: both the unredeemed (but redeemable) indigene and the recidivist European(s) are opposed by the same position, and, it must follow, are eventually or potentially assim- ilable to it. Absent from this equation is the less assimilable figure of the Xhosa woman, "denounc[ing] our injustice and threatening] the vengeance of her tribe," who offers a much more material threat to the emerging colonial society. Despite her iconic appeal, the Xhosa woman is not an immediate candidate for the "here" and "few" of missionary endeavour. Pringle's already troubled narrative can invest the woman only with a rhetoric; the logic of her position is not explored. The fact that Pringle's presence as a settler was dependent on the subjugation and evic- tion of Xhosa tribes, and with it the imposition of the very boundaries which the woman had just crossed, simply adds to our already vertiginous sense of the contradictions which beset the Narrative. Pringle concludes his visit with a closer inspection of the settlement on the following morning; this inspection reveals numerous (unspecified) problems - "impediments to be overcome, and defects to be remedied of</page><page sequence="8">8 MATTHEW SHUM no slight description" (17) - but concludes that the tenor of the converts' conduct shows "little that could with propriety be called savage" (17). Pringle's summation of the mission's achievement is particularly revealing in its assumptions about what is civilised, what savage - the very categories which had previously proved so slippery: I shall content myself with observing that, even at this period, whatever there might be visible at Bethelsdorp of African wild- ness and want of the accessories of civilisation, there was little that could with propriety be called savage. There was, even amongst the rudest of the people, an aspect of civility and decent respect, of quietude and sober-mindedness, which evinced that they were habitually under the control of far other principles than those which regulate the movements of mere savage men. They appeared to be in general a respectable and religious native peasantry; as yet, indeed, but partially reclaimed from some of the indolent habits of nomadic life, but obviously progressing, and, in many instances, already farther advanced intellectually than externally. (17) There are some notable shifts here. Where earlier Pringle had located the epicentre of the civilising mission in the "glorious light and liberty of the gospel," it is now to be found in the "control of far other principles than those which regulate the the movements of mere savage men." These "principles" ("civility," "decent respect," "quietude," etc.) point to nothing so much as acquiescence; but what is most revealing is their antithesis: "the indolent habits of nomadic life." The reproach here is directed not at "heathen darkness" but at undesirable economic practices: nomadism (read pastoralism) and indolence (read the failure to practice intensive agriculture, or, alternatively, the failure to enter the settler labour market). The invocations of "light and liberty" are replaced by a blunt pragmatism: a "savage" is a person of "indolent habit," rather than a person "habitually under the control" of (it is implied) a more productive "civility." The italicised "progressing" makes it clear that the bottom line of this narrative of social evolution is "progress," i.e. assimilation into Western social models, of which the first steps are settled agricultural practice in the material realm and Christian conversion in the spiritual. Pringle might have been a Christian humanist and a liberal humani- tarian, but he was also, and this is often forgotten or simply elided, a cap- italist and colonist of firm conviction. "Capital and free government," he</page><page sequence="9">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 9 wrote in "On the Present State and Prospects of English Emigrants in South Africa," "are essential to the success of colonisation" (1824, II, 159). Furthermore, he ascribed the disfigurement of colonial society, the "peculiar state of society existing at the Cape," to a lack of economic lib- erty: "the unnatural and injurious restrictions of the monopolizing system of the Dutch East India Company" (1824, II, 158). What Pringle proposes in the place of these monopolistic practices (the characteristic economic mode of a landed aristocracy) is free trade, the competition of open mar- kets. The full implications of this will not be examined here, but we need to note that the Abolitionist movement (in which Pringle was later to be so prominent) "helped construct a new bourgeois hegemony, even while moving against a more primitive mode of exploitation" (Blackburn 1988, 27). In the Cape Colony, abolitionism and anti-monopolism, or, if one likes, the ideological and the economic, were inextricably intertwined: slavery was not only morally abhorrent, it was also inimical to the eco- nomic interests of the settlers. "[I]t is an unquestionable fact," wrote Pringle, "that the colonists are suffering more or less in proportion as they are possessed of slaves, or, in other words, are receiving a smaller return from their capital, than if it was otherwise invested" (1824, II, 156). Pringle's economism is of a piece with his humanitarianism, just as it frames his understanding of 'rude' societies, such as the indigenous peoples of South Africa - and for that matter the frontier Boers as well. The general matrix of these ideas lies in the moral philosophers and polit- ical economists of the Scottish enlightenment, whose thinking is every- where implicit (if not always straightforward, or even without contradiction) in Pringle's colonial observations. Let us briefly examine what is perhaps the central, or generative conceptual paradigm of that period: the so-called four stages or stadial theory of historical develop- ment. The specifically Scottish provenance of the four stages theory is com- monly ascribed to Adam Smith's Lectures on Jurisprudence delivered in Glasgow in 1762-3; these lectures attributed to historical development a temporal and progressive nature which evolved through the four stages of hunting, pasturage, farming and commerce. Although it is foundational to his general theory of society Smith was not to develop this aspect of it at any length, and explicit comment on stadial theory occurs only intermit- tently in The Wealth of Nations (1776). But other litterati of the Scottish Enlightenment, such as Kames, Millar and Robertson wrote extensively on the subject. Ronald Meek has reconstructed the remnants of Smith's</page><page sequence="10">10 MATTHEW SHUM Lectures on Jurisprudence and tallied them with Turgot's Universal His- tory. Both Turgot and Smith, maintains Meek, proposed a temporal model of historical 'progress' primarily modelled on stages of subsistence activity and came to these conclusions independently of each other in the early 1750s. As Meek remarks, what is innovative about the contribution of Smith and Turgot is the conception that a mode of subsistence, that is an essentially economic activity, acts as the predominantly determining element in the "total situation" (1976, 6). Both the Scottish and the French theorists were crucially influenced by the literature on the indigenes of America, which supplied a laboratory example of man in his most primi- tive hunter-gathering state. They were also provoked by the fact that their own countries were characterised by extremely uneven development, in which the pastoral and the 'commercial' coexisted in the same national space. Meek quotes afc a copybook example of four stages theory a pas- sage from the conjectural historian Andrew Robertson's History of America (1777), part of which reads: ". . . the disposition and manners of men are formed by their situation, and arise from the state of society in which they live. The moment that begins to vary, the character of a people must change. In proportion as it advances in improvement, their manners refine, their powers and talents are called forth. In every part of the earth, the progress of man has been nearly the same; and we can trace him in his career from the rude sim- plicity of savage life, until he attains the industry, the arts, and the elegance of polished society." (Quoted in Meek 1976, 141). Despite the distance between the "rude" and the "polished," and with this a hierarchising of the "state[s] of society," it is evident that there is nothing in four stages theory to suggest that differences are innate, or that it is pos- sible to essentialise racial types. In short, that stadial theory is a form of occidentalism without racism and hence a good deal more benign than the scientific racism which was to come. Robertson could assert, for example, that "there is nothing wonderful ... in the similitude between the Ameri- cans and the barbarous peoples of our own continent" (141); of course a corollary to this would be that a colonising mission could justify itself by claiming to accelerate the social development of a "savage" people, to modernise them in the name of a world-historical logic. Nonetheless, as George Stocking affirms, "these eighteenth century writers did not con-</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 1 ! ceptualise human diversity in rigidly hereditarian or strictly physical terms" (1987, 18). Pringle's observations about the Hottentots at Bethels- dorp might now be read slightly differently: they are "progressing" because they are no longer "savage" (i.e. no longer "nomadic" pastoral- ists). In Pringle's reckoning the mission influence is fast-tracking them from nomadism into the "civility" of the agricultural stage ("a native peas- antry"). The paradox in Pringle's response, however, remains: the 'humanity' of a people is recognised, while at the same time the legiti- macy of their social organisation is disavowed and its (peaceful) eradica- tion encouraged. Although the 'formal' paradigm of Pringle's race-thinking is meliorative and allows for the potential (if not yet actual) equality of all human beings, the Narrative allows us more than a glimpse of how such ideas falter in the lived context of colonial experience. Pringle's inability to place the Xhosa woman, and his consequent aes- theticising of her, is a case in point. Similarly, his oscillation between revulsion and toleration of the Hottentots and their way of life is at odds with the fact that the Hottentots are, as it were, on the path to improve- ment, on the road to modernity, while the Xhosa are not only unimproved, not only premodern, but awi/modern, as well.3 Pringle's Narrative offers us a collocation of historical anecdote, zoo- logical, topographical and botanical observation, reports on the state of the settlers, and much else besides. While structurally indebted to the travel genre, especially in its temporal and prospective sequencing, the Narra- tive breaks from these predecessors in its mix of genres and its range of reference. This break is in itself of considerable significance since it is part of a new type of writing about the colonial experience in the Cape; one which is largely, though not completely, free of the appropriative "planetary consciousness" (Pratt 1992, 15) that characterised the earlier travel writing. The generic eclecticism of the Narrative also marks it out as a predecessor of later colonial fiction, which is conspicuous for its formal instabilities, particularly its slippage between romance and realism. Yet, the very frequency of the Narrative's focal switching allows Pringle to discard, or at least to marginalise, any incident which resists incorporation into the Narrative's controlled flow. The treatment of the Xhosa woman is an example of this. At the end of the section we have just examined, Pringle simply heads his horse in the direction of the coast and the incident is forgotten and never referred to again. Those sections of the Narrative dealing with Pringle's actual residence in the country (approxi- mately twelve of the Narrative's fifteen chapters) are largely concerned</page><page sequence="12">12 MATTHEW SHUM with descriptions of topography, customs, settler perils and improvements, frontier incidents, tales of wild animals, the debacle with Somerset, etc. Questions of race, racism, and racial injustice are present but never promi- nent; they come to the fore only in the three chapters Pringle added in the early 1830s, long after he had left South Africa. It is also of note that Pringle describes only two direct encounters with the Xhosa in the Nar- rative, and that in both cases the Xhosa concerned were captives: the lines of demarcation had done their work. Pringle's second encounter with the Xhosa takes place in the tronk or jail at Beaufort, while he is en route from the frontier to take up a gov- ernment appointment at the state library in Cape Town. This incident is also one which obtrudes into the controlled tenor of the Narrative with a certain violence. The jail which Pringle describes is tiny ("twenty feet long by twelve or fourteen broad"), filthy, and "about thirty human beings, of both sexes, of all ages, and of almost every hue, - except white" are kept within its squalid confines. So fetid is the atmosphere in this carcerai hovel ("the effluvia . . . was too horrible to be encountered") that Pringle has frequently to take "renovating draughts of wholesome air" (167) at the open door. While we are left to assume that the disposal of human waste is not provided for, Pringle is characteristically blunt in his assessment of colonial justice. Of the Hottentot prisoners he observes: Some of these were complainants at the drostdy against the fraud or oppression of the colonists to whom (agreeable to colonial law) they were bound in servitude; and they were immured (agreeable to colonial practice) in this vile tronk, until their masters found it convenient to answer their accusa- tions, and probably to get them well flogged for daring to com- plain: such, at least, was the usual result. (168) But there is more to this than moral denunciation of colonial (il)legality. Pringle's subsequent survey of the prisoners is complicatedly mingled with all the ambivalences and inequalities of colonial experience. In strong contrast with the stink of degradation that infuses this encounter, Pringle employs a strongly visual register to represent the scene before him. These representations, which move towards what we might call an ethnographic aesthetics, articulate a kind of specular colonialism in which indigenous bodies supply an occasion for the unrestricted ability of the colonial eye to read their meaning.</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOS A' 1 3 First up are the Hottentots in their culturally miscegenated attire: "half- native, half European - the sheep-skin caross of their fathers, and the leathern trowsers of the boor" (168). In what is now a gallery of racial types rather than a sordid penal confinement, the Hottentots, who in other passages are the great semi-assimilated hope of the mission endeavour, offer the least allure. The description of their clothing is all we are given. By contrast the "wild bushmen," in their "aspect, dress, and demeanour" offer a spectacle "more barbarous and bizarre than the rudest of the colo- nial Hottentots" (168). We get details of "scanty" clothing, woolly hair, eyes, ornamented cheeks, etc, and with this more exhortation on the injus- tice of justice. But it is a group of Xhosa prisoners who elicit the strongest response from Pringle: There was yet another group, more interesting, perhaps, than any of the others. It was a family of Caffers, consisting of two men, a woman, and child, and a youth of about sixteen. The men were seated naked, on the clay floor, heavily ironed, and having their ankles fixed to a huge iron ring, which confined them like stocks in a recumbent posture. One of them displayed a frame of Herculean size and strength; but his countenance, though free from ferocity, was unanimated by intelligence. The calm and thoughtful features of his comrade, a man of middle age, expressed nothing of mere animal or savage passion, but were marked by an air of mental dignity and reflection. The female was said to be the wife of the latter; and she had an infant encircled in the warm folds of her mantle. Her dress con- sisted of the ordinary caross of ox or antelope hide, dressed with the hair upon it, together with a short petticoat of similar materials, and a kerchief of finer leather . . . drawn, like a veil, over her bosom - indicating, altogether, feelings of womanly modesty and decorum, pleasing to meet with amidst so much wretchedness and barbarism, and forming a favourable contrast to the disgusting nudity of most of the other females around her. Her deportment was quiet and subdued; and her features, if not handsome to European eyes, were yet expressive of gentle- ness and simplicity of character. But the Caffer youth who stood beside this female, and who looked like her younger brother, was truly a model of juvenile beauty. His figure, which was almost entirely naked, displayed graceful ease and great symmetry of proportion. His high broad forehead and hand- some nose and mouth approached the European standard; and the mild yet manly expression of his full black eyes and ingenuous open brow, bespoke confidence and goodwill at first sight. ( 1 70)</page><page sequence="14">14 MATTHEW SHUM In contrast to the volubility of speech and gestural animation of the Xhosa woman, these prisoners are both mute and unmoving, passive objects of the narrator's gaze. Once again, a shift from one paragraph to another also institutes a shift in perceptual register. Here the indigenes, and particularly the Xhosa, stand not as exempla of the savagery of the law but as signifiers emptied of such referentiality and transposed to a dif- ferent order of representation: that of the body and its adornment. It is evi- dent, however, that there is more to these bodies and their adornment (or their lack of it) than meets the eye: it is their faces, in particular, which become a site of decipherment in which a white face is the right face. Here the representation offers an apposite example of what Deleuze and Guat- tari have called "faciality," a distinctively Western modality of represen- tation in which the face overcodes the body and the corporeal is subsumed, or 'reterritorialised,' into a semiotics of significance and sub- jectification (1988, 67-191). The iconic, normative white face is of course the Christ face, and to facialise the body, to bring it under the gaze of "European eyes" and to measure its meaning by "European standards," is also to universalise the Christ face, to Christianise.4 In Pringle's description the Hottentots are, visually speaking, headless, represented only by a motley collection of miscegenated clothes. The Bushmen, while more particular than this, are primarily a series of "bizarre" bodily deformations. Their "narrow, black and piercing eyes," like those of animals, reveal no interiority, offer nothing to read. The Xhosa, by contrast, make their way into a recognisable frame of reference, as Pringle arranges them in a series of visual tableaux - two men, a woman, a youth. The two men (described as "naked") are chained to the floor by their ankles and "confined ... in recumbent posture" like statues - and like statues they are looked at without, it seems, looking back. The first man to be described "display [s] a frame of Herculean size and strength" and the verb immediately alerts us to the man's exhibitionary status. What he next displays is a lack, a facial lacuna Pringle can read as self-evident: his countenance "though free from ferocity, was unanimated by intelligence." He is a body without a mind - perhaps, we might say, without a face. By contrast, the other Xhosa man is nothing but face, a face in which there is no trace of "mere animal or savage passion." This description by privation (a characteristic rhetorical move in all Pringle's South African writing) marks the man as exceptional, but at the same time implies an extraordinarily demeaning racial norm. The face of this man composes itself into a human face of "calm and thoughtful features . . .</page><page sequence="15">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOS A' 1 5 marked by a certain air of mental dignity and reflection." Like our face (Pringle refers specifically to "European eyes," "European standards"), his visage is "marked" by psychological rather than physical features; by indices of an inner life ("calm," "thoughtful," "mental dignity," "reflec- tion") rather than the mere lineaments of exteriority. The confidently con- stative mode of Pringle's prose and its effaced enunciative address combine to create "an inner reality consubstantial with its outer configu- ration" (Barthes 1983, 55), in which the minds of the Xhosa are made leg- ible through their bodies. The next panel of Pringle's tableau vivant in the Beaufort tronk depicts the Xhosa woman. Unlike her fierce and voluble countrywoman in the first encounter, she is claimed to exhibit conventionally feminine attrib- utes - a pointed distinction but one which Pringle does not mention. Unlike the Xhosa men, the woman is differentially placed within her con- text. Where she is notable is where she differs from the other women, and this difference is marked by the fact that, unlike the other women, her breasts are covered ("a kerchief of fine leather . . . drawn, like a veil, over her bosom"). In an outburst of strangely enraged prurience Pringle declares that such "womanly modesty and decorum" is "pleasing to meet with amidst so much wretchedness and barbarism, and forming a favourable contrast to the disgusting nudity of most of the females around her." A dissonance is apparent here: whereas earlier Pringle had com- plained that the prison conditions were a "disgrace to humanity," he seems now to imply that "wretchedness and barbarism" inhere in the prisoners rather than in their pitiful, enforced condition. The comment on "dis- gusting nudity" is especially surprising, given that Pringle must surely have encountered such nakedness before. Why, considering the privations which Pringle so forcefully describes, should this nudity now be construed as an obscene affront to propriety? One can only speculate, but I would suggest that this invocation of a depraved sexuality (for what else is "dis- gusting nudity"?) serves to detract from the oblique but unmistakable homoerotic longing which informs the next object of Pringle's gaze: the Xhosa youth. This "almost entirely naked" youth is a figure of effulgent attraction, an adolescent epicene whom Pringle praises as "truly a model of juvenile beauty." His figure displays a feminised "graceful ease" and "symmetry of proportion," while his forehead, nose and mouth, we are told, in what seems like a judicious drawing back from perfection itself, only "approached the European standard." The description concludes with an ascription of agency to the Xhosa boy that belongs, in fact, to Pringle</page><page sequence="16">16 MATTHEW SHUM himself: "The mild yet manly expression of his full black eyes and ingen- uous open brow, bespoke confidence and goodwill at first sight." Here the facial features are endowed with a persuasive articulacy ("bespoke"), so self-evident is their communication of character. That such 'speaking' should convey "confidence" and "good will" is astonishing considering the plight of the prisoners and the role of white people in bringing it about. The beauty of the youth is thus conjoined with good will toward none other, it is implied, than Pringle himself, since it is Pringle who registers the goodwill, and who brings it into being, despite the active tense of the verb. At no stage is there any indication that these prisoners speak; indeed, there is not even any indication that they move. They are rendered mute and immobile aesthetic artefacts, captured under the confidently omni- scient gaze of Pringle as he collects 'scenes' or draws 'sketches' for his Narrative. If this passage is remarkable for its discursive transformation of suffering bodies into exhibitionary or ethnographic bodies, and finally into an erotic body, and with it an erasure of the stinking materiality of the scene, it is also remarkable for its excess, for what exceeds the observing or attributive eye of the narrator and intimates, however tenuously, his own desire. Such conflicted encodings, with their interplay of desire and domination, recall Bhabha's contention that the colonial subject is always discursively doubled, "inscribed in both the economy of pleasure and desire and the economy of discourse, domination and power" (1994, 66). Immediately after the passage under discussion, Pringle detours into a description of the circumstantial details surrounding the arrest of the Xhosa. This is a level, sympathetic account, far more nuanced than that which describes the arrest of the other prisoners. He concludes by observing that a year later the prisoners, their case delayed by technicali- ties and the infrequent appearances of the Circuit Court, "were still lying immured in the horrid goal" and confesses that he was unable ever to find out what happened to them: "What was their ultimate fate, I was never able to ascertain" (170). These Xhosa have disappeared into a hole in his- tory: all that has remained of them is Pringle's text, with its apparently immiscible levels of denunciation, exhibition and desire. While there can be little doubt that Pringle does indeed bring a certain visibility to the severity of colonial injustice and the sufferings of the prisoners, is there not equally a sense in which this very visibility entails a discursive occlu- sion insofar as these scenes of horrible injustice are aestheticised as spec- tacle, and thus, to a significant degree, anaestheticised of their politics -</page><page sequence="17">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 1 7 the politics of dispossession and degradation which every colonial enter- prise necessarily entails? It is a considerable irony that Pringle's Narrative of a Residence con- tains such an exiguous record of the presence of the Xhosa, the most numerous indigenous people in the area in which he and his family were settled. In anticipation of the spatial zoning and territorial cleansing that were increasingly to characterise subsequent white rule, the imposition of arbitrary 'frontiers' in the Eastern Cape initially screened groups like the 1820 settlers from any prolonged contact with the Xhosa. Pringle never explicitly connects settler presence to the forced removal of the Xhosa, still less the fact that even a 'benign' colonialism, is necessarily founded upon such violent acts. There is, however, one short passage in which this violence exercises its haunting presence. While still settled in the Eastern Cape Pringle made a number of "excursions" through the ceded territory, one of which took him into the "valley of the Mancananza" (subsequently renamed Glen-Pringle after the Pringle family took possession of it; the Xhosa name, according to a footnote, means "valley of the girls"). In his account of this outing, Pringle describes the valley in terms that invest it with a rich array of picturesque tropes: the "impressive character" of the scenery and its "rich and beautiful aspect," "watered by numerous rivulets," "finely diversified with lofty mountains and winding vales," "fertile meadows along the river margins," etc. In the midst of this cele- bration of nature's bounty, the passage takes a peculiar turn: At the time I refer to the whole of this tract had been for some years abandoned to the undisputed occupation of the wild ani- mals, which had consequently flocked to it in great numbers from the surrounding districts. In no other part of South Africa have I seen so many of the larger sorts of antelopes; and the elephant, the rhinoceros and the buffalo were also to be found in the forests, though we saw none of these animals on this occasion. But the remains of caffer hamlets, scattered through every grassy nook and dell, and now fast crumbling to decay, excited reflections of a very melancholy character, and occa- sionally increased, even to the most painful degree, the feeling of dreary lonesomeness which the wild grandeur of the scenery tended to excite. (117) A strangely elliptical logic ties the three sentences in this passage together: at first, Pringle refers to the abundance of wild animals in the</page><page sequence="18">18 MATTHEW SHUM area as being made possible by their "undisputed occupation" of the land. This anthropomorphic phrase, despite Pringle's conscious focus on wildlife, prompts the reader's recognition that the Xhosa did dispute their own dispossession of this land; at any rate it raises the faintest suggestion of issues of possession and dispossession. Pringle then goes on to refer to his own previous sightings of this abundant wildlife, but then adds that on this particular occasion his party failed to spot any elephant, rhinoceros, or buffalo. He underlines this failure to see by italicising the verb of vision in what seems like an odd insistence on a trivial matter, but which nonetheless achieves the rhetorical effect of declaring the animals present, even though they have not been seen. This vacillation between absence and presence then leads into the final sentence, where Pringle's anxious and unmotivated equivocation now reveals itself to be a stalling or fil- tering device, delaying the impact of what was really seen or not seen: the absent Xhosa themselves. In the sentence that follows Pringle confronts the dereliction of Xhosa dwellings, "fast crumbling to decay" amidst a familiarly picturesque setting of "grassy nook[s] and dell[s]." These aban- doned "caffer hamlets," the result of the Xhosa being displaced ever fur- ther eastward, are the ruined remains of defeated communities whose enforced eviction has made possible the settled colonialism of Europeans like Pringle himself. The vertiginous (and clearly unconscious) play of absence and presence throughout this extraordinary passage then culmi- nates in "excited reflections of a very melancholy character," a melan- choly which "occasionally increased, even to a most painful degree, the feeling of dreary lonesomeness which the wild grandeur of the scenery tended to excite." In an inexplicable shift Pringle here transposes the orig- inal excitation of melancholy, with its source in the abandoned Xhosa dwellings, onto the "wild grandeur of the scenery" - the very scenery which earlier he has described in terms which do not carry this emphasis. Within the incoherent economy of this sentence the aggrandising of melancholy into an unbearable and painful lonesomeness, a state of extreme and even frightening ("unbearable") psychic attenuation, is now displaced onto a general effect of the landscape ("which the wild grandeur of the scenery tended to excite") and a landscape, moreover, which appears to have been invented for the purpose. It is difficult not to read the clumsy transference in this sentence as an implied but unacknowledged recognition of the violence and dispossession on which colonial settle- ment is founded. Indeed, the sudden accession of anguished loneliness described in this passage invites a reading in terms of those moments</page><page sequence="19">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 1 9 described by Freud as unheimlich or unhomely / uncanny, of which one version states that such moments signal the emergence of that which "ought to have remained hidden but has come to light" (1990, 364).5 Pringle's immediate dissimulation of this unhomely recognition as aes- thetic effect merely reinforces our sense of its real source and the singular urgency accompanying its repression. This urgency takes on a certain bathos in the very next line (new paragraph) where Pringle deflects any apprehension that might linger from the previous lines with the cheerful announcement that "On another excursion, I had the good fortune to fall in with a troop of elephants - a truly magnificent spectacle, of which I shall endeavour to convey some idea by a more particular description." Seven pages of elephant-hunting follow. This is standard Pringle practice: a detouring away from the unsettling moments. All the same, these moments remain, and they point toward the operation of what we might call a necessary occlusion of the colonial real in order for the colonial imaginary to construct its humanitarian credentials and thereby justify itself to its Self. This enterprise is possible only "on condition that the individuals partaking in it are not aware of its proper logic" (Zizek 1980, 321) since the "proper logic" of colonialism, whether benign or brutal, always involves the arbitrary restructuring of the lifeworld of peoples entirely innocent of any aggression or ill-intention towards the colonising power. Pringle's final appraisal of the Xhosa is the most extended in the Nar- rative and occupies an entire chapter. However, it is completely different in kind from those passages we have already examined, since it is added after his departure from South Africa and consists largely of a condensa- tion of the opinions and writings of people known to Pringle, collated into a form which he describes as "my researches on the topic" (265). He explicitly offers these as more inclusive than "my own limited opportuni- ties of observation" (265). There is much to say about this chapter, but I will limit myself to a few topical observations. Firstly: in his account of what he schematises in the chapter subheadings as "The Caffers; Their name, Appearance, Mode of Life, &amp;c," Pringle offers a degenerationist account of Xhosa "customs and traditions." This is surprising, because stadial theory does not resort to degeneration as an explanatory principle, and it is something one associates more with late nineteenth-century racial thinking; the familiar literary example is Haggard. "In their customs and traditions" writes Pringle of the Xhosa, "there seem to be indications of their having sprung, at some remote period, from people of a much higher</page><page sequence="20">20 MATTHEW SHUM civilisation than is now exhibited . . ." (266). Pringle evinces as illustra- tions of this the practice of circumcision and certain unspecified rites of purification and conjectures that these "would seem to indicate some former connection with people of Arabian, Hebrew or perhaps, Abyssinian lineage" (266). Xhosa religious practice is likewise demeaned as "the shattered wrecks of ancient religious institutions" and he is espe- cially harsh on "sorcery" and the "many acts of revolting oppression and cruelty" that ensue from it. A description of clothing, arms and modes of warfare is followed by the palliative admission that the Xhosa do not harm females in times of war and this leads to the assertion that "They are bar- barians; but not savages in the strict and proper sense of the term" (267). This unfortunate description, which technically locates the Xhosa as pas- toralists rather than hunter-gatherers, implies that even though the Xhosa are not definitionally savage, aspects of their behaviour qualify them as such. The most substantial part of the chapter is taken up with an account of settler-Xhosa interaction since 1798, with special emphasis on the inci- dents which culminated in the fifth frontier war of 1818-1819, and in par- ticular the role played in this war by Makanna. It is vintage Pringle: unrelenting polemic against the prédations and intransigences of settlers and, not far behind them, the colonial administration. One hardly needs to comment on this Pringle because it is the Pringle we know best, indeed for many people this is the only Pringle they know. But while not wishing to deny the force and vigour of Pringle's castigations, nor their value as a resource for the threadbare traditions of South African democracy, it is extremely ill-advised to abstract this polemical Pringle from his context, or to separate the critic of colonial practice from the advocate of colo- nialism. This cautionary reminder leads us - in a very summary manner - to the final section of this chapter, where Pringle advances his own ver- sion of a "rational plan" for the "civilisation" of the Xhosa (276). The practical details of Pringle's "rational plans" are straightforward enough; they are indeed nothing other than an early form of indirect rule, with the Xhosa granted a limited sovereignty in their own much con- tracted territory ruled by what Pringle calls "colonial chiefs" who are in turn subordinate to a white colonial magistrate. In return the Xhosa and their territory will be protected from marauding settlers and internecine strife and liberally endowed with missions and schools. At the time of writing these proposals (1833) Pringle notes with approval that opinions similar to his own have been voiced by the editor of the Grahamstown</page><page sequence="21">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 21 Journal and his correspondents - hardly a source of progressive opinion. Modern readers must confront the paradox that despite his impassioned denunciations of aspects of colonial policy, Pringle is curiously conserva- tive, rather than radical, in his own appraisal of what that policy ought to be. At the end of this chapter Pringle's rhetoric rises to a grandiloquently imperial prospect: The native tribes, in short, are ready to throw themselves into our arms. Let us open our arms cordially to embrace them as MEN and BROTHERS. Let us enter upon a new and nobler career of conquest. Let us subdue savage Africa by JUSTICE, by KINDNESS, by the talisman of CHRISTIAN TRUTH. Let us thus go forth, in the name and under the blessing of God, gradually to extend the moral influence, and, if it be thought desirable, the territorial boundary also of our colony, until it shall become an empire - embracing Southern Africa from the Keisi and the Gareep to Mocambique and Cape Negro - and to which, peradventure, in after days, even the equator shall prove no ultimate limit. (321) Passages like these puzzle our understanding of Pringle not because they in some supposedly straightforward way reveal Pringle to be really just another imperialist, but because they highlight the bafflingly contra- dictory beliefs that sustain the ideological fantasy of a just imperialism. No one could accuse Pringle of being unaware of the savage deeds com- mitted in the name of empire, or of the propensity of the British colonising classes, of all gradations, to leave their humanity at home. And yet, all evi- dence to the contrary, Pringle must still invoke the magnificent illusion of the just empire, spreading forever forward, until it gathers up the whole of Africa in its beneficent embrace. With Pringle one confronts the improb- able situation of a fantasy of imperialism which, rather than becoming more circumspect in the face of traumatic reality, simply inflates itself even further. In the passage above, for example, Pringle refers to Chris- tianity as a "talisman," an apotropaic object with which to "subdue" the "savage," as though empire proceeds by a magical fetishism which bizarrely mirrors the 'primitivism' of the colonised. Might we not say, in fact, that for Pringle belief in empire is a fetish, "an (unconscious) fantasy structuring . . . social reality" (Zizek 1980, 33) rather than simply a false or partial consciousness? How else are we to account for this exaltation of empire in the face of an unrelenting indictment of the administration of</page><page sequence="22">22 MATTHEW SHUM one of its outposts, and Pringle's numerous reflections on the strange depravity of colonial behaviour? Then there is the representation of the Xhosa in the poetry to consider, and with it further levels of inversion and inconsistency. Let us take "Makanna's Gathering" as a representative example. Wake! Amakosa, wake! And arm yourselves for war. As coming winds the forest shake, I hear a sound from far: It is not thunder in the sky, Nor lion's roar apon the hill, But the voice of HIM who sits on high, And bids me speak his will! He bids me call you forth, Bold sons of Kahabee, To sweep the whiteman from the earth, And drive them to the sea: The sea, which heaved them up at first, For Amakosa's curse and bane, Howls for the progeny she nurst To swallow them again. Hark! 'tis UHLANGA'S voice From Debe's mountain caves! He calls you now to make your choice - To conquer or be slaves: To meet proud Amanglezi's guns, And fight like warriors nobly born: Or, like Umlao's feeble sons, Become the freeman's scorn. Then come, ye chieftains bold, With war-plumes waving high; Come, every warrior young and old, With club and assegai. Remember how the spoiler's host Did through our land like locusts rage! Your herds, your wives, your comrades lost - Remember - and revenge!</page><page sequence="23">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE XHOSA' 23 Fling your broad shields away - Bootless against such foes; But hand to hand we'll fight today, And with their bayonets close. Grasp each man short his stabbing spear - And when to battle's edge we come, Rush on their ranks in full career, And to their hearts strike home! Wake! Amakosa, wake! And muster for the war: The wizard- wolves from Keisi's brake, The vultures from afar, Are gathering at UHLANGA'S call, And follow fast our westward way - For well they know, ere evening fall, They shall have glorious prey! This poem was first published abroad in 1827 in the Oriental Herald, a missionary newspaper, and then reprinted in 1828, in London, where it was included in an edition of Pringle's poems. These details are not inci- dental, since they point to the fact that poems like these were primarily intended for metropolitan audiences whose tastes and expectations were something of which Pringle, who had been a professional literary jour- nalist, was very well aware. Poems such as this also had a secondary audi- ence in the form of colonial South African readers, whose main reaction to such sentiments, poeticised or not, were considerably more direct than that of their metropolitan contemporaries. A writer in the Grahamstown Journal (2 January, 1835), for example, berates Pringle for his "draw[ing] down the horrid vengeance of the unsparing assegai apon our defenceless . . . homes" and then vilifies his character, claiming that he had left the Cape and worked for the Anti-Slavery Society because he "found that to be outrageously philanthropic and charitable at other people's expenses was a far more profitable and luxurious occupation" (quoted in Pretorius 1988, 51-52). The sheer intemperance of such reactions tells us much about the philistinism and intolerance of the settler districts in the 30s; but what does it tell us about the type of poetry which served as the pretext for such fulminations? On the face of it the poem reads as a form of dramatic monologue with the poet assuming the voice of the Xhosa warrior-prophet Makanna addressing his people and urging them to rise up against the colonial</page><page sequence="24">24 MATTHEW SHUM English and slaughter them. The elusive and ambiguously inscribed Xhosa of the Narrative are here conjured, through the figure of Makanna, into a full historical presence, and an anti-colonial one at that. I will not attempt an analysis of the poem here, but will only remark that for all its apparent endorsement of Xhosa insurrection, the poem successfully trans- lates their anti-British sentiments into an easily recognisable and assimil- able British poetic idiom. Nonetheless, critics are apt to read poems like "Makanna's Gathering" with a surprising degree of literalness. Damian Shaw for example writes that Makanna does "does not appear as a carica- ture, or even as an a-historical portrait of a native, but as a historical indi- vidual, a worthy opponent of the British and one, moreover, who had right on his side" (1998, 45). Similarly, Pereira and Chapman, in their intro- duction to the 1989 edition of Pringle's African Poems contend that Pringle's poetic representations enable the Xhosa, along with other indige- nous peoples, to "emerge as actual people rather than as myths or phan- toms of the colonial psyche" (1989, xxiv). Of "Makanna's Gathering" they claim that, along with other poems, it "initiated a tradition of 'protest' poetry" and that in the poem Pringle adopts a "pseudo-persona in order to advocate retaliation by the Xhosa against the injustices of British colonial incursions" (xxiv). Yet such readings are surely overhasty in their desire to attribute to Pringle an undifferentiated identification with the cause of the Xhosa; in addition, are there not grounds to query the implicit view that poetry of this sort is somehow able to convey to us authentic "histor- ical individual^]" and "actual people," given the intractable mediations of the 'scene' of colonial representation? Indeed, the different ways in which the Xhosa are represented in the Narrative and in the poetry raise inter- esting questions as to why Pringle felt so free to evoke a Makanna of doomed and noble heroism and, in a quite explicit way, to take his side against the British. Why was it that the poetic form could license this ide- alising of the Xhosa, so clearly contradictory not only to the expressed opinions of the Narrative but to its troubled subtexts as well? I can obviously only gesture towards how one might reconstruct the contexts of such licensing, but the first place to turn would be the early Romanticism which marked Pringle's formative years, a tradition with its own uneasy relation to the politics of representation and the place of the aesthetic. A substantial re-evaluation of Romanticism has taken place in recent years, and one of its central arguments has been that "the poetry of Romanticism is everywhere marked by extreme forms of displacement and poetic conceptualisation whereby the actual human issues with which</page><page sequence="25">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE XHOSA' 25 the poetry is concerned are resituated in a variety of idealised locations" (McGann 1983, 1). Might we not see in Pringle's colonial evocations an even more extreme form of the displaced poeticisation of "actual human issues," and their reconfiguration in an expressive tradition where African warrior-prophets, along with other imperial exotica, serve merely as loci for a type of aestheticisation which makes poetic, and hence manageable, the distant, ambiguous and often bloody conflicts of empire? Could one not argue that the formal devices and conventions characteristic of such poetry, through their very familiarity, serve to seal these activities off from the colonial real and relocate them in the imaginary of polite letters rather than to incite explicit resistance to imperial rule? Contemporary commen- tators on Pringle's poetry, we are told, "united to ascribe to him unfailing 'elegance'" (Miller &amp; Sergeant 1957, 23) rather than anti-imperial polemic. This is not to claim that the entire body of Pringle's work is merely ornamental; it is to suggest rather, that the poems on the Xhosa require a properly historicised reading, and that such a reading would sig- nificantly restrict their interpretation as verse that strikes back against the empire. Poems such as these should also be read in adjacence to a whole line of poetic and narrative construction dealing with the 'clearing' of the Scottish Highlands and the literary reconstruction of those events of vio- lence and eviction as idealisations of a safely vanished past. Peter Womack, for example, writing of James Hogg's poetic reconstructions of Highland resistance to the Hanoverian clearances, comments that "Against improvement in its political form of liberal rationalism, the Highland image expounds a glamorous futility .... which ratifies authority even, or rather especially, at the expense of practical effective- ness" (1989, 54-55). And here we remember that it was in James Hogg's Poetic Mirror, in 1816, that Pringle published one of his first poems, an early version of The Autumnal Excursion. This was a poem, moreover, dedicated to Walter Scott, Pringle's literary mentor and benefactor, whose entire body of work has at its centre an elaborate reconstruction of High- land history. Recent work on Scott has focussed on the clearances as "a site for the rehearsal of Britain's larger colonial project: an imaginary zone in which the spatial processes of colonial penetration and development were practised on a small scale before being brought to bear on much of Africa and Asia" (Makdisi 1998, 80); and the discursive complicity of Scott's novels in recreating these events as a romance in which the histor- ical "is reduced to spectacle, which turns everything into an object of observation, exegesis and representation" (Richards 1994, 134). In the</page><page sequence="26">26 MATTHEW SHUM Narrative Pringle occasionally refers to indigenous peoples in terms either of Gypsies or Highlanders, and it is clear that the representational resources available to him draw significantly from this tradition. Another overlapping area of influence would be abolitionist literature, of which there was a profuse outpouring from the 1770s onwards, and which very often rested on a rather anodyne heroisation of distant suffering (Daby- deen 1979, 44). By placing Pringle within the layered and frequently dis- crepant contexts of his formation and reception, we might begin to be in a position to understand why it is that the Xhosa of the Narrative and the Xhosa of the poems differ so markedly; and we might, as an initial move, understand the latter as highly mediated constructions whose relationship to colonial conquest is not as oppositional as it might appear to be. NOTES I would like to thank Leon de Kock, Tony Voss and Damian Shaw for their generous, and often critical, readings of this paper. 1. For an extended treatment of 'disciplinary' colonialism see Clifton Crais (1992). 2. David Bunn, for example, writes that Pringle is "a key figure in the estab- lishment of Liberalism in South Africa" and that critical investment in his works marks "the narrative beginning both for the myth of origins that enables liberal ideology to dissociate its own history from that of the monster apartheid and for a patriarchal and racist version of South African literary history that often portrays him as the "father of South African poetry" (1996, 136). 3. A. E. Voss (1982) uses aspects of stadial theory as part of his critical framework in analysing Pringle's representation of the Bushmen. 4. For a reading of Deleuze and Guattari that explores the application of their ideas to colonial discourse see Young (1995), in particular Chapter 7 "Colonialism and the Desiring Machine." 5. In an unpublished conference paper Malvern Van Wyk Smith (1998) reads this passage as tentative evidence of Pringle's abandonment of a "profoundly Wordsworthian engagement with the elusive border world of the Eastern Cape" and a "decision to retreat from apocalyptic solitude and instead to embrace polit- ical advocacy" (12). My reading of this passage is framed by a very different con- text and set of intentions, and to engage fully with Van Wyk Smith's very interesting paper would require more space than is warranted here. It is worth noting, however, that he does not allude at all to the problems of syntactic and ref- erential evasion which I find in this passage.</page><page sequence="27">THOMAS PRINGLE AND THE 'XHOSA' 27 WORKS CITED Barthes, Roland. 1982.
