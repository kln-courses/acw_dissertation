<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wandering Among Obelisks: Goethe and the Idea of the Monument Clark S. Muenzer On the evening of July 5, 1827, a short visit by Weimar's chief architect and super- visor of construction Coudray with Goethe, Eckermann, and Chancellor von Muiller prompted some intriguing remarks by the aging writer about monuments and cultural memory. The occasion of Goethe's meditation, however, was not some stately public memorial, but Coudray's plan for a small, iron, lattice-work fence around Wieland's grave that the Oberbaudirector had designed and now quickly rendered for his friends in a sketch. Upon Goethe's return from a carriage ride in the park, according to Eckermann, a wide-ranging political conversation had initially ensued. In rapid succession the assembled company coursed through the latest news about Wellington in Russia and the liberation of Greece from Turk- ish domination, as well as more distant matters of state, including Napoleon and the unlikely revolutionary zeal of a certain aristocrat. Then, somewhat abruptly, the group's attention turned to less hectic matters-"Sodann kam man auf friedlichere Dinge" (FA 39, 247)--only to settle for a while on the hardly momen- tous idea of embellishing the gravesite in Osmannstedt with the protective iron en- closure. No sooner had the architect and Chancellor von Mtiller departed, however, than the mundane plan for the gravemarker-which had already be- come "ein vielbesprochener Gegenstand unserer Unterhaltung" (FA 39, 247)- produced the most expansive observation of the evening in a curious exchange be- tween Goethe and Eckermann. The narrow questions of function and form, which Coudray had presented for approval, had gradually exceeded their limits to unfold into an issue of existential urgency. With the topics of conversation flowing through the vicissitudes of political history and the significance of commemora- tive structures for aesthetics and literature-including Lord Byron's representa- Modern Language Studies 31.1 @Northeast Modern Language Association</page><page sequence="2">6 Wandering Among Obelisks tion of the cityscape in Don Juan and Goethe's own recently completed memorial to the English poet in the third act of Faust-the writer finally felt moved to assess the role of cultural memory and its artifacts in his own thinking: "Da ich in Jahr- tausenden lebe," he remarked, so kommt es mir immer wunderlich vor, wenn ich von Statuen und Monumen- ten h6re. Ich kann nicht an eine Bildsaule denken, die einem verdienten Manne gesetzt wird, ohne sie im Geiste schon von ktinftigen Kriegern umgeworfen und zerschlagen zu sehen. Coudrays Eisenstabe um das Wielandische Grab sehe ich schon als Hufeisen unter den Pferdeftigen einer ktinftigen Kavallerie blinken, und ich kann noch dazu sagen, dag ich bereits einen Ahnlichen Fall in Frankfurt erlebt habe. Das Wielandische Grab liegt tiberdies viel zu nahe an der Ilm; der Flug braucht in seiner raschen Biegung kaum ein hundert Jahre am Ufer fort zu zehren, und er wird die Toten erreicht haben (FA 39, 247-48).1 Monuments, according to Goethe's meditation, cannot be viewed statically. Standing before one may actually more unsettle than comfort the observer.2 Through his own millenial optic, moreover, the interpretive will, or intention, at work in a monument's founding, also appears fragile. As an expression of worldly power it can weaken over time and invite challenge. Goethe's intuition, which re- verberates with the political tones of the evening's earlier discussion, is significant. Within the politics of culture, whatever prominence and authority accomplished i Unless otherwise noted all Goethe citations will be made according to the Frankfurt edi- tion of his collected works, abbreviated FA. 2 Cf. the prologue to act four in Der Triumph der Empfindsamkeit (1787) for Goethe's satir- ical presentation of a potpourri of eclectic elements, in'cluding monuments and other commemorative objects, that comprise the sentimental garden: "Was ich sagen wollte! Zum vollkommnen Park/Wird uns wenig mehr abgehn./Wir haben Tiefen und H6hn,/ Eine Musterkarte von allem Gestrauche,/ Krumme Gagnge, Wasserfaille, Teiche,/ Pa- goden, Hohlen, Wieschen, Felsen und Kltifte,/ Eine Menge Reseda und andres Gedtifte,/ Weimuthsfichten, Babylonische Weiden, Ruinen,/ Einsiedler in L6chern, Schafer im Gruinen,/ Moscheen und TOrme mit Kabinetten,/ Von Moos sehr unbequeme Betten,/ Obelisken, Labyrinthe, Triumphb6gen, Arkaden,/ FischerhOtten, Pavillons zum Baden,/ Chinesisch-Gotische Grotten, Kiosken, Tings,/ Maurische Tempel und Monumente,/ Griber, ob wir gleich niemand begraben,/ Man mug es alles zum Ganzen haben" (FA 5, 96). With its pigpen hidden behind a temple, however-"So verstecken wir zum Exem- pel,/Einen Schweinstall hinter einen Tempel" (FA 5, 95)-and all species of filth camou- flaged for the players and audience as the Ideal-"Und, Salva Venia, jeden Quark/ Wickeln wir in eine sch6ne Schal' ein" (FA 5, 95)-Goethe's stage-setting raises a suspi- cion that something more than a satisfying "Point de vue" (FA 5, 95) is at stake within the totality of the topography that its garden's numerous monuments, ruins, obelisks, graves, outlandish plantings, serpentine paths, and other exotica comprise: "Freilich der Herr vom Haus/ WeiB meistens wo es stinkt" (FA 5, 96).</page><page sequence="3">Clark S. Muenzer 7 individuals have achieved, all self-attributions of creative autonomy are inherently problematic. At best they are necessary fictions, at worst, dangerous presump- tions. Like the dynamic landscape in Weimar defined by the swift flow of the river Ilm, the fields of cultural production involve random turns and rapid changes. Consequently, the ground on which communities establish themselves and pre- sume to build for the future is constantly under erosion. The question of cultural memory in Goethe's reflection on monuments, which began with a fitting gesture to time as long duration, thus ends, incongruously, with an uncanny image of lim- inality: an unstable riverbank and a stranding that even the dead will not escape.3 Still, conventional monuments are ubiquitous in Goethe's writing, and--de- spite the meditation on Wieland's grave-there is little in the criticism to suggest that he understood them other than in conventional terms. Whether placed in gar- dens or in large open spaces, such objects traditionally served as the repositories and material markers of an enduring design that was initially intended to re-assert the staging authority of some historically significant individual or event over fu- ture generations.4 A recent example for this kind of anthropomorphic construc- tion, which stabilizes the monument as the dominant presence of a personalized and reified origin, can be found under the entry for Denkmidler in the recent Goethe-Handbuch, where both the discussion and bibliographical note are limited to a straightforward chronological accounting of the many public monuments dedicated to Goethe over the years as the founding figure of modern German lit- erature (Voerkel, 183-84). But the article's failure to make even the briefest refer- ence to rhythms of permanence and change as a constitutive feature of his discursive intelligence-I want to suggest-is symptomatic of a significant failure in Goethe scholarship to notice how the dynamic relationship between old and 3 Only one year earlier, at the outset of act three in Faust II, the phantasmagorial Helena had re-collected her own ambivalent three-thousand year history of circulation in the cultural marketplace (agora) by emerging, still groggy, on a beach that situates the phan- tom's passage of return between the overpowering sea and the inviting threshold of the paternal house: "Vom Strande komm' ich wo wir erst gelandet sind,/Noch immer trun- ken von des Gewoges regsamem/Geschaukel, das vom phrygischen Blachgefild uns her/ Auf straubig-hohem Rticken, durch Poseidons Gunst/Und Euros Kraft in vaterlandische Buchten trug" (11. 8488-93). For more on the Helena-act and Goethe's discourse on mon- uments cf. Muenzer 1994. Cf. also Lohse for an interesting discussion of border regions in the context of Goethe's unexecuted plan to commemorate his trip to Switzerland in 1779 with a monument. 4 My analysis of Goethe's idea of the monument has benefited from more general philo- sophical and historical studies, including the works by Lipps, Mattenklott, Morsch, Reuge, Riegl, and Yampolsky, as well as the contributions to the two anthologies edited by Assmann and the special issue of Oppositions edited by Forster, all of which collect es- says on monuments and cultural memory.</page><page sequence="4">8 Wandering Among Obelisks new, or whole and fragment, characteristically asserted itself in his thinking about monuments as complex structures.5 Such lack of critical attention is all the more remarkable, if we bear in mind that Goethe revisited the far-ranging issue of com- memoration throughout his creative life with obsessive regularity. The Goethe- Wirterbuch alone notes more than seven hundred occurrences for Denkmal and Monument (1135-36), not to mention the thousands of "hits" that appear for these words and related concepts with the stroke of a key in the electronic version of the Weimar edition of his works. Besides Denkmal and Monument, or Merkstein and Merkzeichen, searches constructed around andenken and gedenken multiply the ex- amples, as do queries for the compounds Denkschrift, Denkmiinze, Denkrede, Den- kreim, Denksaule, Denkspruch, and Denkstein. Such insistence is especially evident within the massive body of literary works, where-in addition to the classical ele- gy-inscriptions, souvenirs, silhouettes, autographs, memoirs, burial mounds, gravestones, and effigies abound, as do obelisks, pyramids, caskets, catacombs, memorial gardens, and mausoleums; or portrait galleries and statues; even eulo- gies and name-day celebrations. Finally, beyond the lists of commemorative ob- jects, places, and events in the literary, scientific, and aesthetic writings, the accumulation of chronologies, diaries, letters, archives, collections, and collected works in Goethe's life-long self-construction strongly suggests that the multiple media of commemoration across the entire range of his diverse oeuvre combine to reveal a conceptual axis in his thinking about nature, art, and society to which he was always connected. As the Coudray anecdote indicates, however, Goethe's idea of the monument cannot be fairly examined without also considering his deep reservations about fixed iconic monuments, which celebrate the priority of cultural foundations in paradoxical association with the inherently subversive position of the innovator.6 To develop this double perspective, I will offer some initial analysis of the subjec- tive, or intentional, underpinnings of the monument in his thinking. If commem- orative objects in their traditional construction are meant to keep ancient deeds 5 This essay is part of a monograph on Goethe's idea of the monument that is nearing com- pletion. With it, I stake out a crucial hermeneutical site in Goethe's analysis of culture and knowledge that the criticism has ignored. With the exception of isolated discussions about specific images in individual literary works-gravestones in Die Wahlver- wandtschaften, for example, or collecting in "Der Sammler und Die Seinigen"-I am aware of nothing in the scholarship that acknowledges the importance of the monument as a structuring device across the full range of Goethe's discursive practices. 6 For a similar contemporary view of the need to develop a differentiated understanding of monuments cf. Mbrisch 49-58. Lipp's massive monograph provides an extensive account of eighteenth-century thinking by situating monuments within an increasingly histori- cized discourse about nature.</page><page sequence="5">Clark S. Muenzer 9 and events alive by evoking the prescriptive design of an authorizing conscious- ness, we might ask, what additional evidence do we have for Goethe's complica- tion of the autonomous creative will at their source. In other words, how did the writer, whom two prominent scholars still monumentalized in an intellectual bi- ography for the Goethe-Year 1999 as "ein Universalgenie" (Donat and Birus 7-13), himself reconfigure the "original genius," one of the most commanding characters to oversee the stage of eighteenth-century aesthetics? During the early 1770's, of course, along with Herder and other cultural critics, Goethe had still affirmatively associated the appellation Genie with individual names like Homer, Erwin von Steinbach, and Shakespeare. With the appearance of Werther, however, whose protagonist would discard the popular designation as a tired fashion while eulogizing an older, female mentor,7 certain problems came to light that had already emerged as an obscure background in the cultural criti- cism. That is to say, Goethe not only reconfigured the self who says "I" in his fledg- ling novel by memorializing Werther's first-person voice as a book;8 he also took an important step in unwrapping the discourse of genius by featuring the difficult reciprocity of innovation and commemoration as an informing theme within the novel's opening Homeric and concluding Ossianic sections, as well as in their in- terrelationship.9 We might do better, therefore, to shift the focus of our examina- tion of Goethean monuments and their intentionality onto the shifting subject of erotic desire-which compulsively positions and then repositions itself in its drive to connect with the elusive totality of nature or worldl0-than onto some mythi- cal moment of founding as configured in the problematic (paternal) endowment 7 Cf. Werther's letter of May 17, which dismissively mentions the "Stempel des Genies" (FA 8, 20) as the inadequate coinage of the age for the wonderfully complex affective powers of the mind. Interestingly, these powers have been located in a decidedly feminine place, or matrix, to suggest an alternative to the place of patriarchal founding, or masculine cre- ativity, that has been identified with Goethe's own discourse of genius in Wellbery 87-183. 8 The poem "Prometheus," which first celebrates original genius by speaking through the renegade's mask, concludes by evoking the subject position as an unstable supplement to genius with an emphatic "Wie ich!" (FA 1, 204). Despite its association with the Geniezeit, that is, Goethe's "anti-hymn" (Wellbery 309) goes a long way in displacing the discourse of original genius. 9 By reading Homer in the original Greek in Book One while translating Ossian in Book Two, Werther provides an important example for this kind of complication. 'o Cf. Werther's letter of May 17th again, where he begins unwrapping (entwickeln) "all das wunderbare Geftihl [...], mit dem mein Herz die Natur umfagt" as a first step in his own journey toward memorialization: "War unser Umgang nicht ein ewiges Weben von feinster Empfindung, scharfstem Witze, dessen Modificationen, bis zur Unart, alle mit dem Stempel des Genies bezeichnet waren?" (FA 8, 20).</page><page sequence="6">10 Wandering Among Obelisks to originate.ll "[W]as ist das Herz des Menschen!" (FA 8, io) Werther inquisitive- ly exclaims in his opening letter as he recalls setting out to locate a suitable dwell- ing place for himself in a fresh new world by sundering his connections with family and friends. But his refuge Wahlheim-the place of "choice" and, therefore, emancipation, that he in part discovers and in part invents on his odyssey-ulti- mately establishes a new idea of home and return as the condition of possibility for authentic human intercourse.12 If the voice of original genius in eighteenth-cen- tury criticism had first aestheticized the enlightenment project of autonomy- which in Kant's famous prize-essay (1784) would promote the reasoned use of crit- ical speech within a circumscribed public sphere,13 then the refuge Wahlheim in Goethe's novel-like the stage in Lessing's Emilia Galotti (1772)-further compli- cated culture's emerging field of individual subjects in free association with each other by sexualizing it. Werther decidedly fails'4 as a practicing artist, but his epis- tolary testament as commemorative novel successfully records the possibilities and limitations of the speaking "I" through the tragic itinerary of his infinitely la- bile human heart.15 Already as a twenty-five year-old, that is, Goethe had under- stood that tracking subject positions within dynamic economies of desire would be a more fruitful exercise in self-exploration than reifying the "genius" of monu- mental individuals.16 As the decades accumulated, this view only deepened into a defining moment of Goethe's creative intelligence. Thus, on February 17, 1832, less than one month before his own death, he cautioned Friedrich Soret that all colossal things are con- 11 For an extensive discussion of genius as donation and the wound of modernity in Goe- the's early lyric cf. Wellbery 87-183. 12 From his place of exile (or asylum) within the precincts of "Wahlheim," Werther returns to his own self-determination in desire. But the drive to connect with others, which he experiences as sexual attraction, proves to be as dangerous as it is vivifying. Benjamin Bennett offers the most radical reading of the novel's interest in sexuality as an explora- tion of the (female) resistance to the (male) constitution of literature. 13 "MOndigkeit," in this connection, which is the goal of Kantian enlightment, primarily ex- presses itself as the academic freedom to speak, not as a clergyman, but as a scholar. With the exception of its concluding "tribute" to Frederick the Great, which obliquely high- lights the rationalized machines of repression, Kant's essay does not further analyze the erotic possibilities of "opening" one's mouth. Cf. Kant 13; 17. A genealogical reading of this metaphor in the context of the enlightenment discourse of autonomy would extend from Lessing's Orsina and Emilia through Goethe's Werther to Kleist's Penthesilea, (whose heroine defends her cannibalization of Achilles by recalling that the German words for kisses and bites rhyme: "So war es ein Versehen. Ktisse, Bisse,/ Das reimt sich, und wer recht von Herzen liebt,/ Kann schon das eine for das andre greifen" (11. 2981-83). 14 For a discussion of failure in Goethe's novel within the context of Kant's analysis of the sublime cf.

"Das gro6te Genie kime nicht weit," Goethe continues, "wenn es alles nur aus sich selbst sch6pfen wollte! Was ware denn das Genie, wenn ihm die Gabe fehlte, alles zu benutzen, was ihm auffillt, hier den Marmor, dort das Erz fuir seine Ruhmeshalle zu nehmen?" (FA 38, 521). Ap- parently, in this, his final re-construction, the stuff of genius, which had endured in traditional monuments of marble and bronze, would find itself replaced. "Was bin denn ich selbst?" Goethe asks in conclusion. Ich sammelte und benutzte alles was mir vor Augen, vor Ohren, vor die Sinne kam. Zu meinen Werken haben Tausende von Einzelwesen das ihrige beigetra- gen, Toren und Weise, geistreiche Leute und Dummk6pfe, Kinder, Manner und Greise, sie alle kamen und brachten mir ihre Gedanken, ihr K6nnen, ihre Erfah- rungen, ihr Leben und ihr Sein; so erntete ich oft, was andere gesdet; mein Le- benswerk ist das eines Kollektivwesens, und dies Werk trigt den Namen Goethe (FA 38, 521-22). When almost all had been said and done, in other words, Goethe continued to be suspicious of the unfettered mind of genius, although many have still failed to un- derstand its blinding limitations "und tappen mit ihren Triumen von Originalitit ein halbes Leben im Dunkeln" (Chadwyck-Healey). By contrast, to be enlightened means to see the posturing that an aesthetics of pure production and anteriority involves. The products of our imaginative work are never just really our own, Goe- the insists. Indeed, as Werther had suggested almost a half-century earlier, we pro- duce by receptive translation and learn to dwell in the uncertain world by entering hermeneutic processes of exchange. Such is the weaving course of Bildung, which is erotically driven by the desire of the self-alienated to re-connect. In this context, the underlying resonance of Goethe's polemical aesthetics of rebellion during the early 1770's and his presumably conservative "classical turn" 15 Goethe's "Ober den Granit" (1785) juxtaposes the monumental and rock-solid granite- mountains of the primeval imagination--"ihr altesten w0rdigsten Denkmaler der Zeit" (FA 25, 314)-with the indeterminability of the human heart-"des jungsten mannich- faltigsten beweglichsten veranderlichsten, erschutterlichsten Teiles der Sch6pfung" (FA 25, 313). In Muenzer 1995 I examine the granite-essay in the context of Goethe's geological idea as part of his discourse on monuments. 16 Wellbery astutely argues that a more productive approach to the concept of genius than reading it referentially "might be to consider [it] as a symbolic position and to elaborate its charge of significance-the investment it attracts-by attending to its functional placement within a discursive constellation" (122). Goethe's discourse on monuments, I am suggesting along these lines, is one such a constellation. Within it, the problem of ge- nius as origin is revisited as the problem of culture, or Bildung, in terms of subjectivity, desire, power, death, etc.</page><page sequence="8">12 Wandering Among Obelisks during the period of political revolution at the end of the century is especially re- vealing. On the one hand, as the chief progenitor of Weimar Classicism during a time of significant intellectual, social, and political upheaval, he helped to design a cultural program that appeared to respond to the dual threats of institutional morbidity and epochal change by privileging enduring forms, including the self- engendering subject, that he felt were endowed with the resiliency of character. On the other hand, while the mark of character, as a kind of indelible inscription, or Vorschrift, fatefully shaped the course of each individual life in his view, 17 the power within individuals to build worlds in innovative works of genius was tem- pered in his thinking by an appreciation for the fragmentary, potentially presump- tive, and even tragic quality of all human projects and self-constructions, however significant they might appear at the moment of their inception. As I have suggest- ed, in fact, from the time of Goethe's defiant entry onto the literary scene, the cre- ative subject incongruously projected the authority of works of genius by modeling them on some inimitable precursor, whose incommensurable example it felt challenged to emulate. Already in its early formation, that is, the subject po- sition was marked for Goethe by an acute awareness of historical belatedness and the corrosive effect of time. And this awareness spanned the entire range of his ca- reer-from its first formulations in the aesthetic criticism of the 177o's through the height of its consolidation in the poet's orphic reflections during his post-revolu- tionary, so-called classical years. From the outset, Goethe clearly understood that the challenge of originality could not be explored without paradoxically address- ing the question of survival. If desire implies the desire to connect, it can also fuel a need to converse with the dead. And so Goethe was drawn to memorialize the likes of a Homer, a Sophocles, an Erwin, a Shakespeare, or a fictitious Ossian, whose recollection, he discovered, bolstered, rather than blocked, the expressive autonomy of the aspiring ephebe. A telling analysis of the enigmatic reciprocity in Goethe's early thinking be- tween processes of hermeneutic recovery and the emergence of the self-legislating subject on the uncertain stage of desire and death appears in the well-known com- memorative speech that he composed to honor Shakespeare upon his return from legal studies in Strasbourg. Delivered in his father's Frankfurt home on the occa- sion of the playwright's name-day in October, 1771, but also meant for his compan- ions-in-(aesthetic)-arms back in the Alsatian hinterland, the ground-breaking 17 Cf. the "Dimon" poem in "Urworte. Orphisch" (1820), which elaborates the "Gesetz wonach du angetreten" in these terms: "Und keine Zeit und keine Macht zerstickelt/ Gepragte Form die lebend sich entwickelt" (FA 2, 501). Along similar lines, Erwin von Steinbach's gothic cathedral in Strasbourg had been called an enduring work of art in "Von deutscher Baukunst" (1773) that was "characteristically" German and, therefore, also masculine and "bildend" (FA 18, 110o-118).</page><page sequence="9">Clark S. Muenzer 13 memorial, or "Andenken" (FA, 18, 9), features a fictional orator who symptomat- ically introduces the hymn to Shakespeare's theatrical genius by linking his per- sonal intimation of immortality to the universal condition of death: Mir kommt vor, das sei die edelste von unsern Empfindungen, die Hoffnung auch dann zu bleiben, wenn das Schicksal uns zur allgemeinen Nonexistenz zuruckgefuhrt zu haben scheint (FA 18, 9).18 While the individual may hope to thwart his eradication through the enno- bling prospect of surviving in the collective memory, however, the model of a cre- atively autonomous subject, which the speech goes on to monumentalize in the indomitable will of the rulers on Shakespeare's historical stage, cannot ignore the destructive force of time. Death, after all, with its inevitable threat of oblivion, first motivated the speaker's desire to re-appropriate Shakespeare and, thereby, recon- nect himself and his fellow celebrants with the living whole of nature or world. Un- like more traditional commemorations of historical figures from a community's past, then, which typically aimed to ensure the continuity of a ruling household or dynasty, Goethe's recovery operation of Shakespeare as a model of poetic genius produces metaphysical comfort for the secularized subject of modern individual- ity by joining it with a foundational moment that is as fragile as it is aggressively self-assertive.19 Genius, the Andenken goes on to acknowledge, is branded by the temporal predicament of its own excessive will to power. Like the fate of the Shakespearean sovereign, the course of each self-creative life inevitably ends in a collision that cuts short the work of its insatiable desire to build and regulate sym- bolic economies: Shakespeares Theater ist ein schoner Raritatenkasten in dem die Geschichte der Welt vor unsern Augen an dem unsichtbaren Faden der Zeit vorbeiwallt. Seine Plane sind, nach dem gemeinen Styl zu reden, keine Plane, aber seine Stucke dre- hen sich alle um den geheimen Punkt (den noch kein Philosoph gesehen und be- stimmt hat) in dem das Eigentumliche unseres Ichs, die pritendierte Freiheit unsres Wollens mit dem notwendigen Gang des Ganzen zusammenstoftt (FA 18, 11). As I have indicated elsewhere,20 the subject whom Goethe hopes to reproduce by founding his monument to Shakespeare is constituted in confrontation and con- flict. It should not be surprising, therefore, that his fictitious orator stages his own '8A similar compulsion drives Werther to stage his suicide as a commemorative act that will finally transform his voice into a book. 19 Cf. the letter to Lavater on September 20, 1780, where the soaring pyramid of Goethe's youthful dreams hauntingly returns in a characterization of his ongoing self-construc- tion as the incomplete and ruined Tower of Babel (FA 29, 299). 20 Muenzer 1995, 183-84.</page><page sequence="10">14 Wandering Among Obelisks polemical re-awakening from the tomb of a morbid aesthetic discipline as a mini- drama21 that calls the youthful partisans of an artistic avantgarde to arms in a gen- erational struggle with their impotent predecessors.22 Of further note, in this regard, is Goethe's curious choice of the Raritaiten- kasten23 as the metaphorical axis of his argument. This optical device, a kind of peep-show for children, was an enlightenment instrument of aesthetic pleasure and pedagogical control that, according to Langen (34-5; 57), enabled the operator to frame crude historical and geographical scenes in ordered succession for the viewer's edification and delight.24 Within the context of Goethe's Shakespeare me- morial, however, this miniature stage of world-history, which was also a popular attraction at annual fairs, has been uncharacteristically reconfigured as a mysteri- ous device of commemoration.25 With the monumental bard as its operator, we are instructed, the same kind of machine had once plumbed the depths of political history to uncover a secret point of collision between the presumptive subjects of dynastic desire and the very structures they had constructed to inhabit. More in line with its carnival origins, then, which suggested subversion and transformation for Goethe,26 the oft maligned Rarittitenkasten has magically broken through its enlightenment limits to rescue memory for the future. Through its reconfigura- tion as Shakespeare's stage, Goethe has offered a substitute for the Blickpunkt that Langen features as the most significant effect of Guckkasten technology. Unlike the peep-show, moreover, which relied on "Umrahmung," "Bewegungslosigkeit," 21 Koopmann, 52o notes how the dialogic structure of the speech's aesthetic debate creates the impression of a theatrical staging. 22 "Ich zweifelte keinen Augenblick, dem regelmaigen Theater zu entsagen. Es schien mir die Einheit des Orts so kerkermaiig angstlich, die Einheiten der Handlung und der Zeit lastige Fesseln unsrer Einbildungskraft; ich sprang in die freie Luft und flihlte erst dag ich Hande und Fi0Be hatte. Und jetzo da ich sehe wie viel Unrecht mir die Herrn der Regeln in ihrem Loch angetan haben, wie viel freie Seelen noch drinne sich krOmmen, so ware mir mein Herz geborsten wenn ich ihnen nicht Fehde angekiindigt hatte und nicht taglich suchte ihre TOrme zusammen zu schlagen" (FA 18, io). Cf. Muenzer 1994, 193 ff., where I discuss Goethe's reconstruction of the classical unities in the third act of Faust II through his staging of Helena as a monument. 23 According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the German term was taken over in English as "Raree-show." Dr. Johnson noted that the device was associated with unruly Sa- voyards. Goethe's Shakespeare-memorial, I am suggesting, fully exploits this subversive genealogy. 24 For a detailed discussion of the consolidating role of Guckkasten technologies in the con- struction enlightenment culture cf. Langen 5-44. Stafford and Terpak offer lavish illus- trations from the Getty Museum's recent exhibition of "Devices of Wonder", including a "Rare Show" (8), that were supposed to enhance perception of the world in its complex and magic diversity.</page><page sequence="11">Clark S. Muenzer 15 and "Zusammenschau" (8-9) to achieve focus and thereby settle the spectator into a submissive attitude,27 the Shakespearean stage in Goethe's re-invention is vertig- inous, open-ended, and saturated with time. Having mounted it, the defiantly self- assertive and belated subject under construction in the speech can enter the invis- ible field of change that is history and participate in its dynamic totality. The disorienting topography of Goethe's Shakespeare-stage is also dangerous, however. Ambitious world-makers and zealous world-breakers vie for ascendancy here28 in an unending clash between an older, imperial "order of things"-with its presumptive claim of universal commensurability-and an upstart order-with its disruptive urge to force change.29 Like the banished Titan Prometheus, whom the speech mentions in conclusion, the model for Goethe's own generation of builders is both author and outlaw. As the renegade father of human culture will soon brazenly proclaim in the celebrated "anti-hymn" (Wellbery 309), the sover- eign progenitors of the symbolic order, including the ruling gods whom he scoffs, are all vulnerable to the dominion of time: Ich dich ehren? Woffr? Hast du die Schmerzen gelindert Je des Beladenen? 25 Belittling constructions of the Rariti:tenkasten are more common, even to Goethe: Cf. Werther's letter of January 20, as well as "Dritte Wahlfahrt nach Erwins Grab im Juli 1775" (1775), where the machine's disposition toward heteronomy is highlighted in opposition to its connection with enlightenment discourse: "Tausend Menschen ist die Welt ein Rarititenkasten, die Bilder gaukeln voruber und verschwinden, die Eindrocke bleiben flach und einzeln in der Seele, drum lassen sie sich so leicht durch fremdes Urteil leiten, sie sind willig die EindrOcke anders ordnen, vergchieben und ihren Wert auf und ab be- stimmen zu lassen" (FA 18, 182). A similar view figures prominently in Lessing's 41st Literraturbrief. 26 Cf., in particular, "Das r6mische Carneval," FA 15, 518-552, which well in advance of Ba- khtin featured the emancipatory power of popular festivals. It first appeared, significant- ly, in the revolutionary year 1789. Goethe had, of course, already associated two dramatic figures on his own historical stage with carnevalesque elements of subversion. Accord- ingly, G6tz von Berlichingen, who is often connected with the Shakespeare-speech, and Egmont both rebel in the name of tradition. 27 We are reminded here of the kind of expectation that we bring to conventional monu- ments, which steadfastly rivet and control the observer in order to protect a community of shared values from the damaging effects of temporal succession. 28 As Goethe comically suggests in the "Hexenkuche" scene from the first part of Faust: "Das ist die Welt;/Sie steigt und fillt/Und rollt bestandig;/Sie klingt wie Glas:/Wie bald bricht das?/Ist hohl inwendig./Hier glanzt sie sehr,/Und hier noch mehr,/Ich bin leben- dig!/Mein lieber Sohn,/Halt dich davon!/Du mu8t sterben!/Sie ist von Ton,/Es gibt Scherben" (11. 2403-15).</page><page sequence="12">16 Wandering Among Obelisks Hast du die Tranen gestillet Je des Geingsteten?

In the spirit of the Shakespears Tag commemoration, the fate of all sovereign- ty, according to the Promethean mindset, is irremediably bound up with the brevity of life. Like the divine rulers whom they emulate even the most noble in- dividuals (and the highest-born potentates) will one day fall from the Olympian heights of their creative desire (and political power) into the pit of earthly oblivi- on: "Dieses Leben, meine Herren, ist ftir unsre Seele viel zu kurz," the speech had first cautioned, Zeuge, dag jeder Mensch, der geringste wie der h6chste, der unfahigste wie der wiirdigste, eher alles mud wird als zu leben; und dag keiner sein Ziel erreicht, wornach er so sehnlich ausging;-denn wenn es einem auf seinem Gange auch noch so lang gltickt, fillt er doch endlich und oft im Angesicht des gehofften Zweckes in eine Grube, die ihm Gott weig wer gegraben hat und wird ffir nichts gerechnet (FA 18, 9). In line with this argument, I am proposing that Goethe came to perceive all monuments and related commemorative media-like Shakespeare's Raritiiten- kasten stage-in terms of their informing tensions and contradictions. Because he understood from a very early point in his career that the hope of the autonomous subject to endure was a temporally complex undertaking, his rendering of monu- mentality continued to be marked by a revisionary impulse in pursuit of the secret mechanism that drives our reconstruction of the world as meaning. If the Goe- thean monument, as an architecture of the mind (or idea), is first of all a sensible object that aims to secure the autonomy of the perceiving subject, then it also su- pervises the making of temporary homes in the world (or cultures) that must be made over in order to survive. Conversely, as a mnemonic device that is affectively charged, Goethe's commemorative media also regulate the collective memory by constantly maintaining the possibility of their own re-invention. 29 Cf. Goethe's construction of the demonic in the Egmont passages of his autobiography as something that is required to constitute the world in its complex totality by remaining disruptive of its symbolic order-"eine der moralischen Weltordnung wo nicht entge- gengesetzte, doch sie durchkreuzende Macht" (FA 14, 841). Paradoxically conserving in its power to force random change, "das Damonische" emerges as that region within the divinity (or monumental individuals) that stands against itself: "nemo contra deum nisi deus ipse" (FA 14, 842). Jane K. Brown's essay on Goethe's conservatism in this volume makes a similar point.</page><page sequence="13">Clark S. Muenzer 17 According to Walter Benjamin, the usurper monarchs of the early modern pe- riod, including Shakespeare's kings, were perpetually condemned on the stage of tragic drama (Trauerspiel) to experience the decline of their first powerful asser- tion of interpretive authority.30 As the "sovereign" builders of cultural house- holds, or dynasties, they had enjoyed the allegorist's right to establish symbolic orders by dispensing names. But this power was also shown to be alienable, and thus, a point of contestation for successor generations. In the modern secular era, Benjamin's reading implies, all governing paradigms eventually age. Like Shakes- peare's historical stage, therefore, or the dizzying succession of historical curiosi- ties viewed through the Raritiitenkasten, Goethe's Shakespeare-souvenir (Andenken) similarly imagines a fluctuating field of contending forces-"den ge- heimen Punkt (den noch kein Philosoph gesehen und bestimmt hat)"-through which all natural and cultural formation eventfully passes in generational succes- sion (FA 18, 11). To enter this generative place of perpetual emergence and disap- pearance, moreover, means preparing oneself-in the manner of the hardiest wayfarer, "des gr6ten Wanderers" (FA 18, 9)-to traverse all conventional boundaries, including those set by the rules of neo-classical tragedy, human insuf- ficiency, and death. With Shakespeare in his seven-league boots as their guide, Goethe's belated subjects of history stand ready to accept the challenge of living outside the confines of the familiar. From their distant outposts, the world has be- come a network of illicit border transactions for them that sustain a temperate zone of comfort by surreptitiously connecting its most divergent regions of icy contraction (or political reaction) and fiery expansion (or revolution). Signifi- cantly, Goethe's rhetorical monument to Shakespeare's dramatic genius, which began within the father's study as a hermeneutics of recovery, moves, in conclu- sion, outside the paternal household and into a global landscape of hermeneutic discovery.31 Das was edle Philosophen von der Welt gesagt haben, gilt auch von Shakespeare, das was wir b6s nennen, ist nur die andre Seite vom Guten die so notwendig zu seiner Existenz und in das Ganze geh6rt, als zona torrida brennen und Lappland 30 Because he owed his own position to armed rebellion, this kind of monarch was forced to resist any change, Benjamin points out: "Wer herrscht ist schon im vornhinein daffir bestimmt, Inhaber diktatorischer Gewalt im Ausnahmezustand zu sein, wenn Krieg, Re- volte oder andere Katastrophen ihn herauffithren. Diese Setzung ist gegenreforma- torisch" (55). At the same time, however, the tragically condemned potentate on the stage of Trauerspiel could not escape his true destiny in historical time: "[E]r fillt als Opfer eines Migverhiltnisses der unbeschrankten hierarchischen Wtirde, mit welcher Gott ihn investiert, zum Stande seines armen Menschenwesens" (62). Interestingly, Benjamin's book appeared in the same year that Riegl's essay on monuments was published as part of his collected works.</page><page sequence="14">18 Wandering Among Obelisks einfrieren mug dat es einen gemaliigten Himmelsstrich gebe. Er filhrt uns durch die ganze Welt aber wir verzirtelte unerfahrene Menschen schreien bei jeder fremden Heuschrecke die uns begegnet: Herr, er will uns fressen.

Goethean recollection, in the spirit of Werther's first letter upon arriving near Wahlheim, leaves comfort and ennui behind to set out. It therefore also implicitly includes a critical moment of creative oblivion.32 Well before Nietzsche, that is, Goethe's orator has staked out a genealogical standpoint that re-interprets the in- stituting values of a self-satisfied community (acknowledged as good) in terms of an all-too-human need to domesticate and contain the mysterious urge of the cre- ative subject to assert its interpretive will as an eternal truth over others (allego- rized as evil). The more difficult lesson for humanity, however, requires understanding this kind of willful assertion as the condition of possibility for es- tablishing the institutions of science, art, and society, through which we experi- ence the world. The speaker thus further suggests that the fictional self- construction of the subject as an autonomous maker must be supplemented with a recognition that all emancipated subjects are also haunted by the defensive tech- nologies of their own enlightenment culture.33 Like Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialektik der Aufklirung (1947), Goethe's critique of reason's idyll here implies that personal freedom and responsibility might also be inventions of the disingenuous to exert social control. As the cosmological myth in Book Eight of his autobiogra- phy indicates, the self-engendering subject, which models itself on "eine Gottheit [...], die sich von Ewigkeit her selbst produziert," (FA, 14, 382) remains effective only to the extent that it can avoid the blind self-centeredness of Lucifer. The pulse of creation requires both contractive and expansive phases.34 In order to endure, invention must remain open to re-invention. Working through Shakespeare's 31 The reciprocity of inside and outside, which also informs the opening scenes of Faust, will become an important feature of the Goethean monument, as it typically occupies a threshold place in its project of re-discovery. Cf. also "Von deutscher Baukunst" (1773) and "Ober den Granit" (1785) in this regard FA 18, 11o-18; 25, 316, as well as Rorty, 377 ff., who presents edifying philosophical discourse, in contrast with traditional epistemology, as the challenge to generate new descriptions of the world. 32 A number of Goethe's characters, including Egmont and Faust, either swoon, sleep, or faint as a first stage in their reconstruction as literature. 33 Cf. note 13 above.</page><page sequence="15">Clark S. Muenzer 19 strange apparitions, therefore, means confronting their frightening forms as the shocking and ambivalent face of the authoring subject itself, whose "presumptive" genius it is to create worlds according to its own design, but whose historical des- tiny it is always to fall short. The cultural fields we build are impermanent homes, or zones of comfort, that temper-but do not eradicate from memory-their re- pressed origins in violent struggles for empowerment. Accordingly, they are as vulnerable to the winds of time as the farmer's scarecrow. The modern subject of interpretation, in other words, which is an effect of genius in the "Shakespears Tag" memorial, is also a subject of history and politics. Time does not stand still on Shakespeare's stage, and so this subject cannot simply hold its ground and sur- vive. When understood in conventional terms, monuments do hold the ground on which they are built in order to simulate the suspension of time. Like the enlight- enment Guckkasten that featured "Umrahmung," "Bewegungslosigkeit," and "Zusammenschau" (Langen, 8-9) to achieve focus and control, they steadfastly rivet and control the observer in the hope of protecting a community of values from the damaging effects of temporal succession. As stable and clear points of ref- erence from where people reconnect with their founding principles and celebrate their traditions, they foster a naive belief that past glory never fades. Where no hermeneutical gap separates a community from its origins, all successive genera- tions are "at home" in a shared history; the violence of their beginnings is sup- pressed; and no translational work is required to speak across the gaping divide between present and past. In 1903 the Viennese art-historian Alois Riegl (1858-1905) argued against this persistent and widely held view of commemorative efficacy in an essay that was in- tended to guide public policy regarding historical monuments in the dual monar- chy. Despite their origins in a legislative debate about the care and preservation of commemorative artifacts during the waning days of the Austro-Hungarian em- pire, Riegl's remarks, which have gained currency again, reveal a critical intelli- gence acutely aware of the material basis of culture and its constant exposure to the corrosive forces of change.35 Like his contemporary Freud, who understood history more through belatedness and the mechanisms of repression than as the gradual self-comprehension of the autonomous mind, Riegl operated as a cultural historian in search of an alternative to Hegelian idealism. No longer could the di- alectic preserve Weltgeist as reason through the passage of time, which instead 34 Such systolic and diastolic moments together restored "the true pulse of life" that, ac- cording Goethe's myth, had been threatened by Lucifer's egocentric self-construction (FA 14, 384). Using an analogous image, the Shakespeare-speech features the dramatist- as Prometheus' rival-breathing life into the colossal characters on his stage (FA 18, 12). 35 For more on Riegl cf. Forster and Yampolsky.</page><page sequence="16">20 Wandering Among Obelisks bears witness to willful strategies of endurance in the face of inevitable decline. Change, Riegl felt, is driven by a mysterious Kunstwollen, which stages survival as a Darwinian struggle without granting any single vision the sustaining power of the absolute. Hence the prominence in his tract of another kind of universal: the certain process of aging, which inscribes all cultural achievements with death. As Riegl reminds his fellow-preservationists, even traditional icons of bronze or stone-which were meant to celebrate the timeless legitimacy of some founding principle--cannot avoid erasure and unintelligibility. In an effort to understand monuments in terms more adequate to his own, twentieth-century, doctrine of historical determination, then, Riegl goes on to distinguish two kinds of com- memorative objects. Those in a first group he broadly identifies with the pre- modern cultures of the ancient Near East, as well as with ancient Greek and Roman antiquity. His second group, which is modern, arose during the Renaissance, when "historical value was first recognized" (22). The purely "objective" monuments of the ancient and medieval worlds, according to Riegl's system of classification, were "erected for the specific purpose of keeping single human deeds or events (or a combination thereof) alive in the minds of future generations" (21). He therefore calls them "intentional," by which he emphasizes their self-absorption and exclu- sive focus on life. According to Riegl's reconstruction, an "intentional monu- ment," or "gewolltes Denkmal," secures its meaning by dint of the vitality that founded it. However, its stability and aura of presence remains naively oblivious to the environmental forces that actually threaten all monuments with change- whether objectively, by effacing an inscription, or subjectively, by revising the in- terpretive will at work in their founding. The earliest commemorative objects were thus also strangely at odds with themselves. While evoking eternal presence, Riegl reminds us, they were not made of the most "durable materials" (26). Conse- quently, an intentional monument typically endured as foundational only so long as "those for whom they were erected and those who had an interest in preserving them" retained constituencies (like families, associations, and institutions) "to guarantee them a longer life-span" (26). Because the monuments of pre-modern cultures did not project themselves into the distant future, Riegl concludes, they were not really meant "to leave testi- mony to later centuries" (23). What he calls their "commemoration-value," or "Erinnerungswert," that is, was defined by their makers in extremely narrow terms and remained relatively insignificant. Yet as the gap widened between the inaugu- ral moment of memorialization and its later reception, the meaning of ancient monuments could less easily be linked to the founding intentions of some bygone community of values. Consequently, the domain of their commemoration-value gradually expanded into a kind of cultural unconscious. What had begun as a rep- resentation of timeless and objective significance, in other words, became increas- ingly historicized and subjectified. By the Renaissance, in fact, when appreciation for the artistic and historical qualities of ancient monuments was already flourish-</page><page sequence="17">Clark S. Muenzer 21 ing, the intentional monument was being replaced. In its stead, Riegl continues, the unintentional monument, or "ungewollte Denkmal," saw the power of in- scription transferred from an object's original makers to its most recent beholders. As the experience of monuments became increasingly historicized and subjecti- fled, moreover, and their commemoration-value increasingly burdened "with traces of age," a third and final category arose "in which the object [had] shrunk to a necessary evil" (24). In other words, with the addition of age-value, or "Alterswert," to commemoration-value as the defining term of the modern, unin- tentional monument, Riegl arrived at that point in a lengthy process of reconstruc- tion where the monument's material grounding as objective reality had begun to dissolve. Disconnected from any original significance or purpose at this point in its historical trajectory, an aging, subjectified, and ultimately, de-materialized ob- ject of commemoration36 henceforth served largely to "trigger in the beholder a sense of the life cycle, of the emergence of the particular from the general and of its gradual but inevitable dissolution back into the general" (24). Riegl's story about the changing experience of monuments from antiquity through the modern era was in part determined by his own position as a scholar between nineteenth-century historicism and evolutionary biology, on the one hand, and early twentieth-century decadence, on the other.37 While problematic in its some of its detail, his analysis traces an overall movement that resembles Goethe's largely unnoticed reconstruction of conventional monumentality of more than a century before. In both instances, the scope of commemoration ex- pands over time, and its complexity compounds, as an initial, naive moment of self-presence, or conscious life-in which some transparent meaning has been collected and valorized as an objectifiable truth-is scrutinized and reconfigured from the standpoint of reconnecting with the past through the distance of forget- ting. And for Goethe, as for Riegl afterwards, the historical trajectory of monu- ments produced an increasing awareness that the self-engendering subject38 (or a monument's founding intentionality) is itself a dynamic site of exchange between the old and the new. As the mapping of the commemorative field in the Shakespeare speech sug- gests, however, Goethe's departure from eighteenth-century conventions regard- ing the form and function of commemorative objects did not express itself as 36 For more on this process of abstraction, cf. Reuge, 76-80, whose modern, "un- gegenstindliches Denkmal" has a precursor in Goethe's "Agathe Tyche," discussed be- low. 37 Forster, 7 ff. 38 "This process, which proceeds from the value of intentional monuments through histor- ical value to age-value, is but a part of a much broader process of emancipation of the individual in modern times" Riegi 29.</page><page sequence="18">22 Wandering Among Obelisks outright rejection. Instead, he focussed his attention on a number of defining fea- tures in the monument that would have been obvious to his contemporaries in or- der to explore its inherent movement toward self-contradiction. Brief consideration of Tischbein's oil-portrait of his famous friend in the context of Sulzer's Theorie der schinen Kiinste (1773-74; 1792-94)39 will begin demonstrating how this process of reconstruction operates in other Goethean discourses that were shaped to understand the world through the monumentalized objects of ex- perience. Of the countless figural representations of Goethe, none has survived in the popular imagination so long as Goethe in der Campagne di Roma (1787). Reason enough to accord to the painting the status of "monument" and to consider it an instructional point of reference for Goethe's revision of conventional assump- tions. Within the field of Goethean iconography, "Der Wanderer aufm Obelisk," which beyond its longevity is monumental in both size and artistic intention, has probably produced the most extensive catalogue of any Goethe image. Thus, in ac- cord with the entry in Sulzer's aesthetic lexicon, it fulfills the most general require- ment for the Denkmal by serving as an index of commemoration, both now and into the future. A monument, according to Sulzer's opening sentence, is [e]in an 6ffentlichen Platzen stehendes Werk der Kunst, das als ein Zeichen das Andenken merkwOrdiger Personen oder Sachen, bestandig unterhalten und auf die Nachwelt fortpflanzen soil (1, 596). In line with this definition, which emphasizes continuous repetition or repro- ducibility, Tischbein painted his memorable portrait using multiple modeling de- vices. After making some sketches and fashioning a terra cotta mock-up of his subject, he duplicated it in an aquatint, before repainting his oversized canvas one last time. And in 1793 he copied Goethe's head in a large drawing. Likewise, in ad- dition to numerous caricatures, we have in our own times multiple works based on the Tischbein image by artists such as Mariani, Wunderlich, and even Warhol. These multiplying portraits are suggestive of the reproductive vigor within the in- animate effigy, which Sulzer mentions, and its challenge of translation, which his article implies with its locution "fortpflanzen," but then leaves unexplored.40 Tischbein's original oil painting, which foregrounds Goethe as part of a vast historical landscape, is filled with natural and cultural objects. The writer, whose contemplative face is in partial profile, rests, with his legs extended, upon the gran- ite ruins of an Egyptian obelisk that was inscribed with hieroglyphic letters in its earliest version. Goethe's larger than life-size figure is draped in a flowing white 39 Sulzer 1, 596-600. 40 For an extensive catalogue of the paintings, drawings, silk-screens, posters, and cartoons that have their source in the Tischbein-image cf. Scheurmann 18-29.</page><page sequence="19">Clark S. Muenzer 23 textile that contrasts sharply with his immense dark hat. But as the costumed trav- eler qua painter gazes outward, he also appears to be looking into the scene in which he has been resting-as if something excessive has caught his attention. By this I do not mean just the scattered architectural objects on the portrait's histor- ical stage, all of which have been linked to an array of rocks, plants, mountains, and clouds. Rather, what appears to exceed the limits of painterly representation is the place itself, which is overbrimming with time and, thus, also oddly out-of- place. "Ich soll in Lebensgr6tge, als Reisender, in einen wei8en Mantel gehtillt, in freier Luft, auf einem umgestuirzten Obelisken sitzend, vorgestellt werden [... ]," Goethe records on December 29, 1786, in the Italienische Reise. "Es gibt ein sch6nes Bild, nur zu grog fuir unsere nordischen Wohnungen. Ich werde wohl wieder dort unterkriechen, das Portrit aber wird keinen Platz finden" (FA, 15, 163).41 Goethe's inability to imagine a place back home that could contain Tischbein's work suggests something critical about how the Goethean monument refuses to confine its interests to stable referents or meanings within sharply demarcated borders. That is, the incommensurability of the painting as a monument with its intended site of emplacement within the home of some well-to-do citizen raises the question of excess, to which I will return. But first I will linger with Tischbein and Sulzer some more in order to add to the list of received attributes regarding monuments. In addition to the size of the portrait-which suggests vitality-or its endurance as an image-which suggests repose-or its expected emplacement in a home-which suggests the comfort, containment, and regulated environment of a domestic economy-its foregrounding of the human figure within a vast land- scape has created the impression of a subject who is supervising the surrounding world from a center of power. The figure's plasticity, moreover, along with its co- lossal dimensions and enveloping drapery, combine to evoke a statue out of antiquity. Our attention, then, is initially fixed onto Goethe's massive body, en- tirely in Sulzer's sense of the corporeality, autonomous disposition, and unique- ness that confronts every beholder of monuments: "Man hat bey jedem Denkmal [...] auf den K6rper desselben [zu sehen], der eine freistehende Masse ist, die durch eine gute Form einer eigenen Art das Auge auf sich zieht [...]" (1, 597). But beyond these material attributes, Tischbein's representation also transfixes the spectator's attention onto the serenely intensive gaze of its dominating subject, which appears to penetrate the scene while remaining above it in contemplative repose. In other words, the viewer is drawn to the painterly monument not only 41 Cf. also Goethe's letter to Charlotte von Stein between December 29th and 30th, 1786: "Tischbein mahlt mich jetzo. Ich laBe ihn gehn, denn einem solchen Ktinstler muB man nicht einreden. Er mahlt mich Lebensgr6fie, in einen weisen Mantel gehtillt, in freyer Luft auf Ruinen sitzend und im Hintergrunde die Campagna di Roma. Es giebt ein sch6nes Bild, nur zu grof for unsre Nordische Wohnungen" (FA 30, 201).</page><page sequence="20">24 Wandering Among Obelisks on account of its mass, or plasticity, but also because it embodies an idea. Tisch- bein's monumentalized Goethe, who is a piece of the painting's extensive histori- cal landscape, has become the spiritus loci of the very scene in which he is placed, thereby documenting the second, incorporeal, condition of monumentality as laid out by Sulzer. It is not just a massive object toward which the eye is drawn. We also feel compelled to attend to the intentionality as its source-"den Geist oder die Seele desselben, wodurch [...] der Haupteindruk, auf den das Denkmal abzielt, soll bewtirkt werden [...]" (1, 597). In its most simple formulation, the monument implies a moral imperative, or "Sollen," that flows from an authoritative desire, or "Wollen," to rivet our attention and institute a symbolic order of control. Howev- er, the additional implication that the monument's felicitous completion produc- es a succession of belated spectators who finally cannot preserve the focus of its instituting Haupteindruk remains as veiled as the writer hidden (gehiillt) behind the artist's smock. Beyond these material and ideational qualities, some additional features in Tis- chbein's Goethe concord with Sulzer's list of glosses to characterize the monument as a genre of the fine arts. First is the sensation of presence, which is a function of sheer size. Commemorative objects are "[g]rofte Gegenstinde von ernsthafter Art" (1, 598), Sulzer asserts. Hence his earlier imperative that they focus the eye and draw passers-by from great distances: "Jedes Denkmal soll das Auge derer, die es sehen, auf sich ziehen, und in den Gemtithern empfindungsvolle Vorstellungen von von den Personen oder Sachen, zu deren Andenken es gesetzt ist, erweken" (1, 596). Apart from their sheer massiveness, the entry continues, which attracts the visual attention of the observer and re-awakens a connection with their founding principle, the materials that are typically used to construct monuments must be durable: Seit dem die Schrift erfunden worden ist, scheint eine an 6ffentlichen Plitzen gesetzte schriftliche Nachricht das leichteste Mittel, den Endzwek der Denkmailer zu erreichen; und daher haben auch die einfachsten der Denkmialer ihren Urs- prung, Pyramiden, Siulen, oder bloge Mauern, aufwelchen eine Schrift in Stein gehauen, oder in Erzt gegossen, zu lesen ist (1, 596-97). The mnemonic capability of writing, which Sulzer highlights here as the surest means for a monument to fulfill its communicative purpose of consolidating a public sphere, is enhanced-we are reminded-when it has been made from stone or bronze. The inscription, or Inschrift, however, which was originally intended as a prescription, or Vorschrift, will finally be forgotten, only to reassert itself in new contexts as a belated directive, or Nachricht, from the past. Sulzer's deceptively straightforward description, it seems, has again introduced unnoticed complexi- ties into the conventional equation, including the delayed effect of a writing that can be read as a kind of Freudian Nachtriiglichkeit. As my analysis of the commem- orative speech to Shakespeare has suggested, moreover, Goethe's complication of</page><page sequence="21">Clark S. Muenzer 25 such unreflected assumptions about monuments would explore in hermeneutic terms what the treatments of his contemporaries had glossed over or ignored: all prescriptive writing is done under erasure. Even Tischbein appears to have ac- knowledged this by eliminating the original, hieroglyphic inscription on the ru- ined obelisk in the final version of his painting. When understood in the complex totality of their belated reception, monuments-as structures of language-ulti- mately express the psycho-dynamics and political underpinnings of interpretive desire. In an letter to Lavater on September 20, 1780,42 Goethe offers a telling descrip- tion of his own effort at self-construction in this regard. His most fervent hope, "den grossten Menschen gleich zu thun" initially accords with Sulzer's ethical im- perative for monuments by placing the aspiring artist in the moral orbit of mon- umentalized figures from the past.43 Almost immediately however, Goethe reinscribes this duty, which first located the law of his self-engendering in some founding predecessor, into an economy of overwhelming desire: Diese Begierde, die Pyramide meines Daseyns, deren Basis mir angegeben und gegrundet ist, so hoch als m6glich in die Lufft zu spizzen, uberwiegt alles andre und lisst kaum Augenblickliches Vergessen zu. Ich darf mich nicht saumen, ich bin schon weit in Jahren vor, und vielleicht bricht mich das Schicksaal in der Mit- te, und der Babilonische Thurn bleibt stumpf unvollendet. Wenigstens soill man sagen es war kohn entworfen und wenn ich lebe, sollen wills Gott die Kraffte bis hinauf reichen (FA 29, 299). Memory, it appears, when coupled with an awareness of individual mortality, can become obsessional, in which case it gives way, at least for a moment, to the power of oblivion, or creative forgetting. Indeed, monuments like Sulzer's pyra- mids-which are also ruins and graves-signal incompletion and the anxious emergence of a desire so large that, paradoxically, it must be broken-off (and for- gotten) in order to persist. In other words, the emerging subject must periodically forgo and forget the comprehensive overview (and sovereign oversight) of the tower's commanding peak by temporarily removing it from his field of vision. Contrary to this kind of temporal complication, commemorative objects, in Sulzer's estimation, should never recede from consciousness.44 Because they em- 42 Lavater's Physiognomische Fragmente, to which Goethe regularly contributed during the early 1770's, provide numerous examples of reading the faces of copper engravings, as monuments, for their indelible marks of character. In its Greek derivation, the word "character" means "engraved line." 43 "Das Tagewerck das mir aufgetragen ist, das mir taglich leichter und schweerer wird, er- fordert wachend und triumend meine Gegenwart diese Pflicht wird mir tiglich theurer, und darinn wonscht ich's den grossten Menschen gleich zu thun, und in nichts grisserm" (FA 29, 299).</page><page sequence="22">26 Wandering Among Obelisks body simple governing ideas that assume permanent validity, they should exhibit complete transparency of meaning. As "ein sehr einfaches Mittel, die Menschen auf die nachdrtiklichste Weise durch die Beyspiele ihrer Vorfahren zu jedem Ver- dienst aufzumuntern" (1, 597), moreover, the allegorized messages from the past must be strong enough to emanate from the time of a monument's founding and endlessly into the future. Memorials, therefore, must also avoid ostentatious orna- mentation: "Hierinn thut man insgemein eher zu viel, als zu wenig," warns Sulzer. "Daher das Sicherste ist, sich der Einfalt zu befleigen" (1, 598). When Goethe com- plicates his own metaphorical self-construction as a monument by moving from the soaring pyramid to the ruined Tower of Babel, then, the universally compre- hensible language of Sulzer's conventional monument has been overtaken by the dispersion of nations and the confusion of tongues. The "eternal present" of vir- tuous reason, which expressed the foundational and transcendent presumptions of a fully conscious enlightenment point-of-view, gives way to a less comforting vision of human destiny, for which the obscure, material realities of death and de- sire incessantly determine how the subjects of history project and spend their cre- ative energies (Krciffte). As I have now indicated, Sulzer actually offers some tantalizing clues that even the most simple monuments are already marked by fissures, or lines of stress, that ultimately reveal the hidden complexities of their construction. His emphatic dis- taste for "elende Denkmiler" in Begribnigstellen," for example, "wo niemand gerne hingeht" (1, 597), motivates a plan to make monuments more accessible to the public in places "die jedermann mit Vergntigen besucht, und wo man mit leichter Mtihe tiglich den besten Theil der Btirger versammeln konnte" (1, 597). Without acknowledging it, Sulzer has configured the commemorative object as an instrument of social organization and control, thereby opening the scene of aes- thetic commemoration (Verniigen) just a crack onto its hidden political genealogy. Along similar lines, a further suggestion to relocate the funereal objects of ceme- teries along the paths where citizens circulate and in the places where they gather in order to situate them, more appropriately, as repositories of ancient virtue (1, 597) is, on the one hand, nothing more than Sulzer's straight-forward expression of his own rationalist belief in the moral efficacy of artistic works and their role in establishing the public sphere. On the other hand, we can obliquely read his sug- gestion as a symptom of the need to eradicate from consciousness the part that death and dying play in culture formation; or as an unwitting hint that even the most sturdy monuments can be moved, and thereby displaced, in order to inau- 44 By contrast, Yampolsky has noted how monuments "appear to fade from the field of vi- sion as one appoaches them" (94). Their colossal size, he suggests along with Derrida, takes them out of the field of representation, and this disjunction in turn produces an ex- perience of Freud's Unheimlich (94ff.).</page><page sequence="23">Clark S. Muenzer 27 gurate a new symbolic regime. The true challenge for modern, unintentional mon- uments, then, concerns revealing an important secret that intentional monuments conceal: our first experience of the commemorative object as an uncomplicated temporal structure that brings a foundational idea to full consciousness is inade- quate. Such ideas are the effects of primary processes, in fact, that work like Freud's unconscious. Accordingly, when Goethe reproduces the world in monumental- ized objects of experience, his attention is drawn less to an empirical reality than to the creative matrix of commemoration itself, from where all understanding is- sues. I have tried to demonstrate this by indicating how-in anticipation of Riegl's historical analysis-Goethe might have read his Sulzer suspiciously. If traditional monuments consciously remember, they can also function as devices that are powered by the energy of forgotten, or unconscious drives. If, at the moment of their founding, they presume to hold the ground on which they stand, if they are stable structures that suggest durability and endurance, they also have mobility and promote change. If they transcend the differences of time and place and speak directly to future generations in universals, if their language is simple, their truths transparent, and their inscriptions indelible, then they show the inescapable traces of age as well and bear witness to a complex analysis of time that understands the past as silent and the future as belated. Finally, if monuments, in their convention- al construction, supervise places of public discourse from centers of official em- powerment, they also lead away from such command stations to the outposts, or dynamic border region, where the eventful process of culture formation transpires in a succession of difficult transactions between what is old and what is new. Returning to Tischbein's Goethe within this larger framework, we can now ar- ticulate its secret that nothing exists in pure static repose. Like Sulzer's article, the painter's largely conventional rendering of Goethe as monument exposes fissures, or fault lines, from where the commemorative object emerges in opposition to it- self. After all, the figure resting upon the displaced obelisk that bore a hieroglyphic inscription in the painting's first version is actually a wanderer. What should we conclude about its putative stability, therefore, or its centered emplacement? Might not Goethe's sculpted body, which is also a textile, resume the trek through the landscape at any moment, thereby weaving the tattered bits and pieces of the past that lie about his feet into some new design? What we have in this rendering of monumentality, then, is both a pregnant painterly moment in the spirit of Less- ing, as well as a critical moment of transition in the history of monuments. Well before Riegl, Tischbein added the perspective of the beholder to the commemora- tive object to render Goethe as a monumentalized subject caught gazing at itself while experiencing the world. He has thereby also captured a subversive moment within monuments that exceeds their inaugurating intentions. None of this should come as much of a surprise, since Riegl's move from the pre-modern "intentional monument," through "age-value," to the "unintention-</page><page sequence="24">28 Wandering Among Obelisks al" and largely de-materialized monument of modern construction has important antecedents in the eighteenth century. We need only consider the cult of ruins in the aesthetic culture of the age or the tendency within neo-classical art and archi- tecture to experiment with non-representational forms.45 In conclusion, then, I will briefly introduce two works by Goethe that together anticipate the full range Riegl's historical trajectory. The first is "Der Wandrer" (1773), a poem that stages a curious dialogue about life and death and the rubble-filled matrix of human cre- ativity in order to present the self-engendering subject in its temporal determina- tion. The second is the only "real" monument that Goethe ever executed according to his own design: the so-called "Altar to Good Fortune" (Agathe Tyche) on the grounds of his Gartenhaus in the Weimar park.46 As "Der Wandrer" begins, we encounter a traveler who has set out to see the ruins at Cumae, which was known as the place where Aeneas had landed and, hence, the point of emergence of the Roman empire. But the traveler's journey back to the site of the oldest Greek colony on the Italian peninsula is unexpectedly diverted, and its purpose transformed, when he happens upon a woman and nurs- ing child who have taken refuge from the heat in the shadow of an elm tree. A con- versation ensues at the foot of a cliff by the edge of the well-trodden road, where another pathway, half hidden in the brush, leads beyond the dusty route to Cumae. The man requests a drink, and the woman agrees to take him to her fam- ily's hut, which is near a spring. As they make their way through the steeply rising landscape, the stranger notices piles of stone, which suggests human activity: "Diese Steine hast du nicht gefiigt/ Reich hinstreuende Natur" (FA 1, 209). Further along, he discovers an architrave, which he later learns had once formed the por- tico of an ancient temple. Apparently, the first stone traces of human work have evolved into the mark of a formative will ("Bildender Geist") on a second stone. As the two continue their climb, the power of the mind to impress its forms on the world-"dein Siegel in den Stein geprigt" (FA 1, 209)-becomes even more evi- dent, when yet another stone is discovered with a partially effaced votive inscrip- tion that the traveller can only partially read: "Eine Inschrift , tiber die ich trete!/ Der Venus-und ihr tibrigen/Seid verloschen,/Weggewandelt, ihr Gesellen [... ]"(FA 1, 209). At this point, the woman invites the man to beat a trail through the brush to her rustic hut, which has been assembled out of the sublime remains 45 Honour 122-39. 46 A second monument of Goethe's design was conceived on his trip to Switzerland in 1779. It was to have been dedicated to the goddess Fortuna, along with her two offspring Genius and Terminus. Goethe hoped that Lavater could enlist Johann Heinrich Fi8fli to execute his plan for the "Granzstein" (FA 29, 227), but this never happened. A detailed descrip- tion is recorded in a letter to Lavater written between the 3rd and 5th of December, 1779. FA 29, 226-29. Cf. Lohse for a discussion of this project.</page><page sequence="25">Clark S. Muenzer 29 of an ancient temple. He immediately crosses over-as if through the vanished portico of the building and into a magic region-where he proclaims in amaze- ment the following prayer: "Gliihend webst du uiber deinem Grabe/Genius! Ober dir/Ist zusammengestiirzt/Dein Meisterstiick/O du unsterblicher" (FA 1, 210). As the woman exits the scene for the water, the wanderer invokes a mental image that reconfigures the erotic and thanatotic extremes of his experience: "Efeu hat deine schlanke/Gotterbildung umkleidet!/Wie du emporstrebst/Aus dem Schutte/ Siulenpaar" (FA 1, 211). He thereby also prepares himself for the end of his en- counter and the resumption of his journey at the end of the poem, which con- cludes with his blessing the woman and her genial child: "O leite meinen Gang/ Natur; den Fremdlingsreisetritt/Den iiber Graiber/Heiliger Vergangenheit ich wandle" (FA 1, 214). "Ich wandle." Goethe's traveler has learned, well in advance of Benjamin's flaneur, to meander without any defined purpose. His once purposeful journey to Cumae, which began on a public road, has brought him to a hidden byway, which he has followed as a detour. But just where will his journey continue? Perhaps it can resume at Cumae again, his destination, where he will reverently walk among the relics of the past and change himself as he meanders. For this place of death, which is near the entrance to Hades, is close to the "new city," Neopolis, as well. As in Tischbein's painting, life and death co-exist in Goethe's landscape of monu- ments. And if the inscriptions on the obelisks there have been effaced- "weggewandelt"-the paths the wanderer will soon trace through its debris- strewn fields will offer prospects and passage across new frontiers. Like ancient "Grinzstein[e]" (FA 29, 227), Cumae's ruins designate border regions where the old and the new are woven together, to be unraveled and reconnected again, in a process of productive exchange. According to my reading of Tischbein's painting and Goethe's own lyrical an- tecedent to Riegl, the Goethean monument, as an object in opposition with itself, is firstly architectural, but only in an ambivalent way. Like all buildings, it appears tied to a site and supposes foundation, structure, and ornamentation. But it is also just patched together and not very durable: "Und du flickst zwischen der Vergan- genheit/Erhabne Triimmer/Fiir dein Bediirfnis/Eine Htitte, o' Mensch/Geniefiest tiber Graibern" (FA 1, 213). It is a temporary dwelling place over a grave that spills into its surroundings. To experience such a place, one must leave the narrow con- fines of the house, abandoning all founding intentions, and circulate within a ma- ternal scene that is staged outside the narrow precincts of the paternal oikos.47 Here, in a field of unconscious work, we can fold ourselves into the undulating 47 Cf. Bennett's Goethe as Woman for a compelling analysis of gender as the defining mo- ment of Goethean creativity.</page><page sequence="26">30 Wandering Among Obelisks surface of a landscape, as if in a garden-where borders recede at every new turn and where discovery awaits the meandering guest from each new prospect. Goethean monumentality, then, involves less empirical things than topograph- ical experiences. As a mental object, his monument does not enjoy a stable exist- ence, but presents bits and pieces of the past to an attentiveness that can see an emergent historical totality in their relationships. As part of a complex whole that, in Robert Venturi's phrase, remains "difficult to achieve" (88), the discrete expe- riences within the fields of monumentality establish the ruin and fragment as con- stitutive of the monument's architectural nature. The building as Denkmal survives and grows old through the perpetual displacement of its parts. It is migra- tory. By pointing to something outside its confining walls, it embodies a basic ten- sion between the familiarity of enclosed places and the shock of their extension into an unknown world beyond. In December, 1776, Goethe first recorded his plan for establishing an astonish- ing monument of his own design on the grounds near his house in the Garten am Stern. The following spring he moved into the Gartenhaus in order to supervise some sorely needed restoration of the old building and site. Then, in the diary en- try for April 5, 1777, "Agathe Tyche gegriindet" (WA III 1, 37). Anyone who has re- cently visited Weimar's souvenir shops will certainly have noticed amidst the deluge of postcards, porcelain, and gingko-leaf jewelry, miniature marble-replicas for the scholar's desk of Goethe's "Altar to Good Fortune," which the poet had ac- tually installed at a round-about, or point of inflection, on the "Malvenallee" in the lower garden. The path in question extends away from and returns to the house.48 The monument, which was fabricated from delicate sandstone and re- sembles the oversized post to an incomplete garden gate, consists of just two spare elements: a sphere and a cube on which it has been delicately placed. According to Heckscher, "sphere and cube had served for centuries as contra- puntal symbols" to signify the "restless motion" attributed to the goddess Fortuna, on the one hand, and the firm grounding of the creator, on the other (251). Con- sequently, Goethe's neo-classical monument, which is without inscription, com- municates a hidden contradiction within monumentality between stability, or foundation, and displacement, or mobility. As the purest plastic expression of en- closure and containment, the cube-which is both a conventional pedestal fixed in the earth and an abstract torso-supports the sphere-which is poised to roll off in all directions. The sphere, therefore, which is also an abstract head, implies through its infinite radii, movement away from its own center and outward. Like later Goethean monuments, it cannot be contained. It is pure surface and eccentric self-extension. Hence it appropriately emerges from the solid foundation beneath 48 Lohse discusses the circuitous path home in the context of Goethe's journey to Switzer- land in 1779 and the plan for a monument to the goddess Fortuna. Cf. note 46 above.</page><page sequence="27">Clark S. Muenzer 31 it to invite the beholder to follow it across the face of the earth, which it also sug- gests. To experience Agathe Tyche on its own terms, then, the visitor to the Garten- haus must meander along a serpentine path to the upper garden, where a prospect is offered onto the monument below and where a commemorative tablet inscribed with the poem "Erwaihlter Fels" (1782)49 still invites each passer-by to rest on a bench. It is almost as though all the readers of the brief commemorative verse are drawn into the scene of commemoration by their passage through the landscape, which also surprisingly turns-up the "missing" inscription from Goethe's monu- ment, or at least one version of it. Are the stones there so ancient and weathered by time that no trace of an inscription remains? Or does their pristine form suggest something entirely new, rather than primitive, that would not be fully achieved until the non-representational monuments of our own century appeared? Perhaps the pure lines of the cube and the pure curves of the sphere that spread invisibly over the smooth surface of Goethe's "founding" object ("Agathe Tyche gegriindet") suggest the infinite lines and curves of a writing that is pure language. By this I mean the kind of transcendental point of linguistic reference, or meta- language, that Walter Benjamin called "die reine Sprache" (13). Only in the post- babelian activity of translation, according to Benjamin, does this supplement of the world's innumerable languages become available to us as the tangled web of relations among and between all of them in their geographical and temporal total- ity. The "Verwandtschaft zweier Sprachen," he asserts, is finally a function of "der Allheit ihrer einander erginzenden Intentionen," or "pure language" (lo, 13). The work of translation, then, which confronts an old with a new way of meaning, (re)produces its original belatedly, as an after-effect. It therefore also resembles the hermeneutical challenge of Goethe's reconstruction of the conventional monu- ment, which his letter to Lavater about self-definition had supplemented by re- placing the traditional pyramid with the Tower of Babel. If, as a post-Babelian language edifice, Goethe's monument reconnects us with an "original," or autho- rial, intention from the past, then only by living within the confusion of tongues and by projecting its own completion into the future. Its tense is not some eternal present, but rather the future perfect. Its story is more about the repressed dynam- ics of historical emergence than conscious origins, which remain effective only in the endless postponements and repetitive rhythm of death and desire. 49 "Hier im Stillen gedachte der Liebende seiner Geliebten;/Heiter sprach er zu mir: Werde mir Zeuge, du Stein!/Doch erhebe dich nicht, du hast noch viele Gesellen;/Jedem Felsen der Flur, die mich, den GlOcklichen nahrt,/Jedem Baume des Wald's, um den ich wan- dernd mich schlinge,/Denkmal bleibe des Glocks! ruf ich ihm weihend und froh./Doch die Stimme verleih' ich nur dir, wie unter der Menge/Einen die Muse sich wihlt, freund- lich die Lippen ihm ktigt" (FA 2, 328).</page><page sequence="28">Works Cited Assmann, Aleida and Dietrich Harth eds.
