Jay Clayton's Romantic Vision and the Novel pursues the interesting question of what happens when the archetypal Romantic experience of the sublime or transcendent moment is depicted in the prosaic fictional world of the realistic nineteenth-century novel. He points</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 129 out that the attempt to portray the Absolute calls into question the very possibility of realistic representation: it disrupts linear chronology, intro- duces improbability, and radically alters the concept of character as stable or organically evolving. He helpfully defines the six elements that characterize the transcen- dent experience, drawing primarily on the poetry of Wordsworth for his examples. Entering the transcendent moment, the writer typically under- goes a loss of sight, of sound, of all sensual awareness. He enters a realm beyond language, where ordinary words no longer suffice to express the contours of the sublime. Such an experience is usually static: the writer feels that he has entered eternity or at least what Virginia Woolf in To the Lighthouse called "a coherence in things, a stability... of peace, of rest." Along with the disappearance of ordinary time and space comes a disappearance of the former self, a sense of the self in the process of transformation and expansion. Finally the writer feels that he has en- countered the numinous or Absolute face to face, a moment that is in- herently liminal insofar as it transports one between two opposing realms of sensuous and linguistic experience. The problem for the realistic novel is how to portray such an ex- perience without undermining the very system of representation upon which the novel rests, without creating a gap in the very fabric of its discourse, and how to register the cost of such a moment, how to define what is lost as well as what is gained. In the chapters that follow, Clayton identifies such moments of transcendence in Clarissa, Mansfield Park, Wuthering Heights, Little Dorrit, Adam Bede, and Women in Love, as well as in poems by Wordsworth and Shelley. Clayton's analyses are extremely lucid and well-written throughout and if they are always somewhat pre- dictable, given his carefully laid out schema, they are still insightful. He sees the liminal growth of Clarissa's consciousness as a violation of the novel's formal integrity, as Clarissa's refusal to participate in daily life can be read as either a Christian triumph or a retreat into solipsism. Here Clayton's posing of the question in terms of Clarissa's ability to create and control a "self" perhaps limits the issues at stake in the novel, for Richardson may rather be attempting to define a new concept of selfhood, an ego whose boundaries are not intact, the kind of fluid self that Nancy Chodorow and Jean Baker Miller have identified as more typically female than male. Unfortunately, Clayton does not always focus directly on the problem he has posed. His discussion of Mansfield Park rightly emphasizes Jane Austen's opposition to Romanticism, but does not deal directly with an experience of transcendence in the novel, whereas his treatment of Wuth- ering Heights forswears the terms of his own argument to adopt instead</page><page sequence="3">130 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE Margaret Homans' analysis of the novel in purely rhetorical terms. His discussions of Wordsworth and Shelley as apocalyptic poets cover well- worn ground, but his analysis of Amy Dorrit as a liminal figure is com- pelling, as is his analysis of Adam Bede's love for Dinah, which empha- sizes the value of the secondary over the originary experience in George Eliot's eyes. His final chapter, which argues subtly for the way that D. H. Lawrence, like Percy Shelley, presents the movement from one state of consciousness to another as necessary and desirable and yet at the same time deconstructs its very possibility, is a fitting, if rather abrupt end, to Clayton's book. On the whole, I found Clayton's schema more useful than his actual applications of it; perhaps other readers, working with his con- cisely differentiated conceptual terms, will be able to describe with more originality and penetration the actual ways in which novels work to con- tain and deny the transcendent experience. In contrast to the lucid prose and systematic clarity of Clayton's book, Cynthia Chase treats us to a precise but relentlessly abstract and difficult application of Paul de Man's deconstructive theory of rhetoric to various unrelated texts: book 5 of Wordsworth's "The Prelude," Rousseau's Six- ieme Promenade, Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," Paul de Man's own crit- icism, Hegel's Phenomenology, Baudelaire's poetry, two stories by Kleist, and Freud's reading of Oedipus. Her project is to reinforce the by now familiar reading of Romantic texts as centrally concerned with the prob- lem of language by emphasizing the way figural texts place the trope of disfigurement at the center of their discourse. Since all but one of these chapters have been in print for several years and are already well-known to readers of Romantic criticism for their dazzling displays of rhetorical subtlety, I need not summarize them again here. The new chapter, on Paul de Man's own use of the rhetorical figures of prosopopeia, apostrophe, and anthropomorphism, will doubtless in- terest the devoted adherents of de Man's methods and discourse. Here Chase shows that for de Man, personification is the giving not of a body but only of a "face" or mask: it is the reading of the natural as human, of the human as natural. Since "face" is given by an act of language, it can only be a "figure," hence a "de-facement." Although de Man and Chase finally describe this process of defacement as a "comedy of recu- peration," it is the comedy of "Boucher debouche," the reopening of the mouth in order to utter the "deprivation of language, which takes place in the process of understanding or reading, the gesture that gives a face to a name" (p. 112). Such an understanding can know only its own lin- guistic disfigurements and deprivations. In the post de Manian, post- modernist culture to which we have now come, such deprived and dis- figured understanding may no longer suffice. Critics like Paul de Man</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 131 and Cynthia Chase have taught us the arts of rhetoric, perhaps, but not the arts of action, engagement, love, and even politics, the very arts of knowledge through transcendence to which Jay Clayton points.
