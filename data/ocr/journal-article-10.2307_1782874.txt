Maps and Illustrations. ?$ 10s. net. The slowly growing library of literature on Nigeria has been enriched by the publication of this voluminous book. Undertaken in connection with the 1921 Census of population in the southern part of the Protectorate, the task of collecting the information afforded to the reader reveals an immense amount of labour both in research and arrangement. The result is praiseworthy. To one like the reviewer, possessed of many years' experience of the tribes in the Northern Provinces of Nigeria, but of a merely general knowledge of those in the south, the book has conveyed a clearer picture of the mass of tribes along the coast and its nearer hinterland than he has found in any other which he has read. To hint that there may be some inaccuracies both in the historical and the statistical details should in no way detract from the recognized value of this first effort to attack the subject comprehensively. The task was a big one, and unfortunately for the moment has lacked the scientific help of anthro? pometry. Mr. Talbot himself remarks in his foreword that the chief work? the classification of tribes and definition of their boundaries?has had to depend almost entirely on the basis of language?a basis which some will think not the most reliable, but the results of some thousands of his personal measurements, which are promised later, will test the correctness of his conclusions. Out of the mist of earliest times the author has drawn the outlines of the migration of Negro tribes to the whole of Western Africa, and in some seventy pages gives us a general history of Nigeria as a whole from the second millennium B.C. to the present time, tracing foreign influences, the advent of Portuguese and English traders, and the gradual development of the country. The rest of the first Volume is devoted in more detail to an account of the peoples as now inhabiting the twelve provincial areas of Southern Nigeria, in which account he disentangles the original threads from about the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and shows the various settlements in the different areas. The story of the Yorubas, the Egbas, the peoples of Benin and Calabar is full of interest. Strange weird figures flit across the stage: the Awni of Ife, believed by the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 81 Portuguese to be the legendary Prester John, the mighty Obba of Benin, and the curious kings of the delta tribes. Much, too, is told of the first ventures of Europeans into the coast belt, and of the conditions which they found there. For the purposes of his ethnological survey the author has divided the population into three main groups : the Sudanese (for want of a better term), the Semi-Bantu, and the Bantu. The most ancient tribe would seem to be the Ijaw of the Sudanese group, who were descendants perhaps of the earliest Negroes who ever penetrated the West African forests. Generally speaking, the Sudanese group (comprising also the Yoruba, the Edo-speaking people, and the Ibo) occupy the west and central portions of the country, and the Semi- Bantu group, of which the Ibibio are most numerous, the east. The Bantu? numerically small?inhabit the south-east corner. When it is remembered that these three groups contain in all some thirty tribes, split up into more than one hundred sub-tribes, and again into two hundred clans or more, one can get some idea of the difficulties encountered in classifying these people on a language basis alone. There are many maps and tables of distribution showing religious beliefs, influence of witchcraft, types of government, twin-birth tabu, etc.?all useful as data for classification?and the second and third volumes cover a great deal of ground relating to these subjects and to customs of birth, marriage, and death, together with the laws of crime, tabu, inheritance, and slavery. The chapters on the religion of the tribes, described as being compounded of polytheism, anthropomorphism, animism, and ancestor worship, and the general connection of Nigerian cults with those of ancient Egypt and the Mediterranean area are very interesting, and tend to show how great an effect the Negroes? an intensely religious and spiritually sensitive race?had upon the northern beliefs. Not less interesting is the account of the minor deities, or Ju-jus? our word derived from the French Jou-jou?the symbolic dolls or images which represent the spirits. Mr. Talbot's own words are worth quoting in this connection : " These spirits form the main support of the Negroes' laws and customs?the policeman who detects wrongdoing as well as the judge who punishes it." In the main the spirits would seem to be benevolent or at least neutral, although their functions often are to award punishment or bring retribution upon evil-doers. These volumes, then, are eminently readable and informative, and are pro? fusely illustrated with excellent photographs. Altogether they mark a distinct advance in our knowledge of West African native races. A. C. G. H.</page></plain_text>
