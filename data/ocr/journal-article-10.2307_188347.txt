<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS This is a rich, well-written, and scholarly book worth the time of anyone who has won- dered what really lay behind the legend initiated in the Discourse. Editorially, it is marred only by the absence of a subject index, despite separate indexes on "Descartes Life, Thought, and Works"; "Historical Persons and Authors (pre-1800)"; and "Scholarly Authorities (post- 1800)". Aside from that, and aside even from Cole's emphasis on the Olympian dreams, this book is an excellent example of what is involved in "historicizing" figures in the philosophy of science, as well as an excellent reminder of why that enterprise is necessary to that discipline.

Bloodsucking Witchcraft: An Epistemological Study of Anthropomorphic Supernaturalism in Rural Tlaxcala. Tuscon: University of Arizona Press (1993), xxii + 476 pp., $40.00 (cloth). Bloodsucking Witchcraft-the title foreshadows the juiciest of ethnographic voyeurism. The authors deliver. In the early morning of 9 December 1960, seven infants were found dead in three adjacent neighborhoods. They all exhibited the marks that typified the action of the feared tlahuelpuchi, the bloodsucking witch. The children had gone to bed as nor- mal, sleeping either in a makeshift crib or with the parents on a mat. The infants were found on the floor near the door. The door was inexplicably ajar, having been closed the night before. The infants had bruises, purple spots, and acchymoses on their heads, necks, and backs. According to local belief, the bloodsucking witch is a person, typically female, born with an insatiable thirst for the blood of infants. The witch has the power to transform herself into animals or insects, and emits a powerful vapor with which she subdues her victim and any potential witnesses. The families reached a consensus that these children had been sucked by the tlahuelpuchi. Nutini, who gathered the ethnographic data, had the opportunity to examine all seven infants on the morning they were found. He interviewed and closely observed the parents and extended family of each. He collected forty-seven cases over the next five years. One of the unique aspects of this monograph is that the ethnographer carefully examined so many events attributed to witchcraft. The core of Bloodsucking Witchcraft is devoted to characterizing the relevant beliefs and values of the residents of Tlaxcala; the history of these ideas; and the social, psychological, and physical context of the events. The work's theoretical and methodological aims will interest philosophers. The authors distance themselves from two traditions which have shaped cultural anthropology: structural- functionalism and hermeneutics. Structural-functionalist explanations of witchcraft have appealed to its function, say, as a mechanism of conflict resolution. The authors reject such explanations of witchcraft both in general and in the case under study. On their anal- ysis, witchcraft beliefs are explanatory systems (albeit systems with a very different kind of history than scientific beliefs). When the local system of beliefs and values is confronted with physical events which are unfortunate, satisfy the local expectations about the work of witches, and cannot be explained in the other ways available to the locals, the events are attributed to witches. While the book would have been improved by greater clarity, the object of its own explanations seems to be this: Anthropological studies of witchcraft need to explain why the locals make the inferences they do (when presented with particular events) and why they have the perceptions they report. Methodologically, this theoretical stance requires that the social and environmental antecedents of events attributed to witch- craft be recorded and analyzed, along with the various psychological and social conse- quences. According to the hermeneutic tradition in anthropology, the goal of ethnographic description is to interpret the natives' view of themselves and their world. Thus, such 679</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS external descriptions of the phenomena are of little use. Nutini and Roberts oppose this view, requiring that the events also be characterized in Western, scientific terms. They then ask why such events are taken to be the actions of witches. The answer to this question appeals to the perceptions and inferences made by the locals, and these in turn are ex- plained by appeal to both universal psychological processes and the local beliefs and val- ues. As a theoretical and methodological work, the book is somewhat disappointing. The prose is wordy and the theoretical analysis is a little vague. More importantly, the authors' analysis of bloodsucking witchcraft does not always follow through on their own theoretical program. For instance, the authors devote a chapter to the likely medical causes of the infants' death. (The book is structured to leave the reader in suspense about the cause of death, so I will not blow the surprise.) Their explanation requires, in typical cases, the mother to move the infant's body. According to local belief, the tlahuelpuchi leaves the infant's corpse by the door or in the courtyard as she makes her escape. The authors argue that the mother moves the corpse from the place where it died to the place dictated by the witchcraft beliefs. Since the placement of the corpse is one of the telltale signs of the action of the tlahuelpuchi, the authors are left with some difficult psychological questions. Is the mother deliberately tampering with the evidence? If so, how can she continue to believe-without hypocrisy or self-deception-in the effectiveness of the tlahuelpuchi to kill (as she apparently does)? Also, after a sucking by the tlahuelpuchi, the parents and extended family report fantastic experiences, for instance, struggles with the tlahuelpuchi. Here the authors' "epistemological" approach to witchcraft requires an explanation in terms of the psychological processes which underlie such behavior, inferences, and perception. Indeed, their demand seems well motivated. Understanding the psychological underpin- nings would be illuminating and would fill in the most important gap in their account. However, the authors' characterization of the psychological states and processes is painted with an anthropologist's brush, not a psychologist's. We never get a clear psychological account of the inferences and perceptions. In the authors' defense, perhaps the weakness in this part of the work simply points out the difficulty of producing a fully adequate explanation of witchcraft. Philosophers of science will be most interested in the relevance of this work to their profession. Two related points deserve mention. First, philosophers of social science have a long-standing debate about the relationship between interpretation and explanation. An- thropologists have tended to emphasize interpretation to the exclusion of explanations. Nutini and Roberts argue that the study of witchcraft requires explanations, and that these explanations need to appeal to circumstances described in Western, scientific terms. Sec- ond, anthropology's concern with human psychology has waxed and waned in this century. Bloodsucking Witchcraft looks to explain both the phenomenon of witchcraft in rural Tlaxcala and the global phenomenon of witchcraft by appeal to psychological, social, and physical factors as well as the local beliefs and values. In this respect, it is kin to other recent work in the study of culture which takes the psychological underpinning of cultural phenomena seriously, such as Lawson and McCauley (1990), Boyer (1994), Sperber (1975), and Hutchins (1980). The most valuable contribution of this book is its exemplification of how anthropological analysis requires anthropologists to describe the events both in their own terms and in local terms. I maintain (and perhaps the authors would agree) that this "double vision" has been crucial to anthropological knowledge throughout the history of the discipline. This work provides theoretical orientation and points up some difficulties and limitations of such an analysis. Mark Risjord, Emory University. REFERENCES Boyer, P.
