<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID STERN Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal THE STUDY OF RHETORIC, which fell into disrepute in the last century, has in recent years experienced an unparalleled revival in con temporary literary criticism.1 No longer confined to describing hieratic norms of discourse, rhetoric has now been extended to studies in linguistic features and topoi of all kinds, to concerns with the strategies of communication in texts as disparate as those of historiography and philosophy that previously have been excluded from the purview of traditional literary criticism. Because of the attention it has directed to the deployment of language as a valid subject in itself, the new rhetoric, for all its divisions, parochialisms, and often arcane procedures, has sharpened our awareness of the ideological, social, and phenomenolog ical forces that have determined the categories of Western critical dis course. At the same time, it has pointed out the limitations to our inherited beliefs about what constitutes literature, even the cultural provinciality that sometimes lies behind our easy acceptance of those beliefs. If only because of this wider perspective rhetoric has now provided us in approaching all forms of literary discourse (my interest here being more with the contributions of this perspective than with those of the more technical and substantive aspects of current rhetorical theory), it holds special potential for adding to our understanding of rabbinic liter ature, and in particular midrash?a subject whose status as a form of literature and as a literary genre has been the focus of much debate in the past several decades.2 If the unique character of midrash lies in the fact that it appears to be situated precisely in that undefined area between those types of discourse we conventionally call exegesis and narrative?on account of which, among other things, midrash has often PROOFTEXTS vol. 1 pp. 261-291 0272-9601/81/0013-0261 $01.00 ? 1981 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">262 DAVID STERN eluded those attempts that have been made in the past to apply to it the normative criteria of Western literary criticism?a rhetorical theory for midrash would enable us to describe this literature on its own terms. In this way, it would not only help us to decide the generic nature of midrash and to distinguish between it and other Palestinian literary genres in Late Antiquity that also involve exegesis; in addition, it would advance our knowledge of what the Rabbis themselves believed to be the function of midrash and how they saw the role it played in their society. Finally, a rhetorical theory would clarify the inner dialectic that saliently defines midrashic discourse between its two dimensions, its micro-structures and its macro-structures: on the one hand, the local exegetical operations behind every individual midrashic opinion, tradi tionally associated with the middot and the other hermeneutical princi ples that constitute the "logic" of midrash;3 on the other, those more prominent literary patterns?like the chreia (anecdote), petihta (proem), exegetical enumeration, and embryonic forms of piyyut?that organize exegesis into larger structures which students of midrash have lately identified with increasing precision and insight.4 In order to suggest the shape a rhetoric of this kind might take, I wish in this essay to discuss one literary form in which these two orders of rabbinic discourse, exegesis and narrative, intersect in a way that is paradigmatic for understanding the rhetorical intent of midrash in gen eral. The literary form is called the mashal, a term?etymologically related to notions of likeness and similarity5?that in rabbinic literature becomes the generic name for those narratives, like parables and fables, that draw a connection between the fictional situations they recount and a concrete one at hand.6 In a fable, as Richard Ingber has remarked, anthropomorphic animals or plants are utilized to portray the particu larly theriomorphic features of human behavior; in parables, a set of parallels is suggested between an ideal event and the immediate one confronting the parable's author and his audience. In either case, the mashal?be it parable or fable?tends to imply the parallel rather than explicate it. The task of understanding the parallel and its implications, or levels of implication, is left largely to its audience; indeed, this char acteristic of the mashal best differentiates it from other forms of narra tive. Neither a simple tale with a transparent moral, nor an entirely opaque story with a secret or esoteric meaning, the mashal is a narra tive that actively elicits from its audience the solution of its meaning, or what we could call its interpretation. Such narratives are by no means the property of Hebrew literature alone. A directly analogous literary form exists in the archaic Greek tradition of the ainos, which includes fables like those of Aesop, types of praise-poetry, and other "allusive narratives told for an ulterior purpose"7?a definition of the genre that also happens to be especially</page><page sequence="3">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 263 apt for the mashal. This tradition can itself be traced back in ancient Near Eastern literature to the Sumerian and Babylonian Streitfabel, and includes such fables as Yotham's in Judges 9:8-15 as well as the parables of Jesus, our earliest attributed examples of the literary form that is more completely represented in later rabbinic literature.8 These other traditions reveal the universality of the rhetorical form, its inherent versatility, and its adaptability to different contexts, literary and cultural. The same versatility and adaptability characterize the rabbinic mashal, which is found in both narrative and anecdotal contexts as well as in purely exegetical ones. Among the former, we may note the celebrated fable of R. Joshua b. Hananiah warning the Jews not to rebel against their Roman rulers (Gen. R. 64:31), and the several meshalim attributed to Hillel (Avot deRabbi Nathan A, 15:3; Shabbat 31a). But it is primarily within the context of midrashic exegesis that the mashal becomes a common rhetorical device in rab binic literature and assumes a normative, regularized form. This regu larized form can already be identified in literature of the Tannaitic period, but it becomes most prominent?and can definitively be proven to have existed?in meshalim recorded in texts dated to the Amoraic period.9 Before describing the regularized form the mashal assumes in this literature, it will be useful to clarify a specifically literary controversy that has dominated much scholarship about Jesus' parables and that touches directly upon our understanding of the essential nature of the mashal. We, of course, typically translate mashal as parable?a transla tion that ultimately derives, it seems, from the Septuagint's parabole (although the Septuagint also translates mashal on occasion with such other Greek terms as paroimia, thrul?ma, and ainigma);10 the same transla tion is also followed in the synoptic gospels where Jesus' narratives are called parabol?i.11 Now the word parabole literally means "something set aside," and hence a comparison or similitude. In Greek rhetoric from Aristotle on, however, the word adopts a more technical meaning designating what one scholar has called "an illustrative parallel," that is, an example, either fictitious or historically factual, that serves as a form of proof in argument.12 Notwithstanding the fact that the term parabole is never used in rabbinic literature (although another term, dugma, cog nate to the Greek paradeigma, or paradigm, is occasionally used as a synonym for the mashal13), the translation of mashal as parable has stuck, along with its association to the parabole of Greek rhetorical theory. As a result, most scholars who have discussed either Jesus' parables or the rabbinic mashal have consistently imported the critical terminology and criteria of Greek rhetorical theory to describe these literary forms. Since Adolph J?licher's seminal work on Jesus' parables, it has therefore been a commonplace of scholarship about Jesus' parables and</page><page sequence="4">264 DAVID STERN the rabbinic meshalim to speak of them as "illustrative parallels" of one sort or another, as didactic tales whose meaning was absolutely clear to their original audiences;14 in some recent scholarship, additional efforts have even been made to show how Jesus' narratives are kinds of extended metaphors that "concretely" embody their meanings in the literary shape of the parable.15 Almost without exception, the meanings attributed to the parables in these studies have been profoundly tran scendental ones dealing, for example, with the timeless challenge of Jesus' eschatological mission. Since J?licher, it has also been almost unanimously accepted that the definition of Jesus' parables as "parables" must rigorously exclude from them all traces of allegory.16 The reason for this lies partly in the typical nineteenth-century Romantic prejudice against allegory as an inferior mode of literary discourse, and partly in the view that allegory is an inauthentic form of speech?because it does not say what it means?and is thus intrinsically unfit for popular (let alone divine) speech;17 on other grounds, it has even been claimed that allegorical discourse was a Hellenistic invention imported into Palestinian Judaism and its literature only at a much later date.18 To be sure, this dogmatic anti-allegorism has encountered some opposition.19 Not the least among the difficulties with it are all the signs of allegorization in the texts of the gospels themselves; nonetheless, it has prevailed. Thus, the famous Markan theory of the allegorical function of the parable (Mark 4:11-13)?a scandal of faith, to put it mildly, for these scholars?has been variously explained away, while Jesus' allegorical explanations for the parables in the synoptic gospels, like the one he is represented as giving for the parable of the Sower (Mark 4:14-20 and parallels), and the allegorical details found in many other parables, have been dis missed as the additions of the evangelists, not ipsissima verba.20 For scho lars of the mashal, in which allegory is even more pronounced than it is in Jesus' parables, the increased allegorization of the literary form espe cially in the Amoraic period has similarly been treated as a sign of the progressive degeneration of the tradition from its original "parabolic" purity.21 My purpose in mentioning this scholarly consensus is not only to dispute its exclusion of allegory from the literary form of the parable, but to suggest that the terms allegory and parable, as they have figured in past scholarship, are simply not relevant to understanding the mashal and its tradition. If the term allegory is taken in its largest possible sense, there is no question that the rabbinic mashal?not to speak of Jesus' parables?contain authentic allegorical characteristics; both the characters they portray and the situations they narrate clearly refer to the kinds of external references associated with allegory. But even if in this respect the mashal overlaps with what we call parable or</page><page sequence="5">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 265 allegory, its function differs distinctly from those of these other literary forms: neither to offer a proof in argument nor to disguise or personify abstract concepts in more concrete forms, but to bring a certain mes sage to bear upon an ad hoc situation before its audience by suggesting it to them through an allusive tale. The allegorical, or symbolic, or referential features of the mashal exist only for the sake of enabling its audience to grasp for themselves the ulterior message the mashal bears. To what extent the meshalim preserved in rabbinic literature or the parables in the synoptic gospels accurately reflect the compositions originally delivered before live audiences?if, for that matter, they ever were at all?is beyond our powers to ascertain. But if they were, we must assume that the ad hoc situations to which they were directed were immediately known to their audiences. Yet once a mashal has been committed to literature, we?its readers?can guess at its original Sitz im ?ben only through its vestigial presence in the literary context in which the mashal is recorded; through this context we, too, arrive at an understanding of what the mashal meant, or means. This, in any event, is the procedure we are accustomed to follow in the case of those meshalim preserved in narrative contexts of which a few, as I have mentioned, are preserved in rabbinic literature. In most cases, however, they are not. Yet precisely this fact?the absence of a narrative context?can help us understand the function of the nimshal, the so called explanation or solution, usually beginning with the conjunction kakh, "similarly," that accompanies virtually every mashal recorded in midrashic literature, and can enable us to determine the originality of the nimshal to the mashal, a question that has been at the center of the allegory-parable debate. (In my translations of the meshalim relevant to this essay, the nimshal is listed as parts 4 and 5,22 and the mashal's narrative, hereafter referred to as the mashal-proper, as part 3.) Now in most past scholarship, the nimshal has been treated as a secondary feature of the literary form, as a later addition that indicates only how the original parable was distorted into a form of allegory.23 For the nimshal is nothing if not an "allegorical" interpretation of the narrative in the mashal-proper, and if these parables were absolutely clear to their original audiences?as they have been assumed to be?an explanation for the parable would have been unnecessary unless it was intended to provide a new meaning for the parable, either because its original one was unacceptable, or because it had been forgotten. This argument from allegory is not persuasive because, as I have already suggested, the mashal is to some extent allegorical. But the mashal is allegorical?or as I would prefer to call it, referential?only to the extent that it must allude to the ad hoc situation which gives it a concrete meaning. For a mashal presented within a narrative context, that narrative supplies the information necessary to understand the</page><page sequence="6">266 DAVID STERN mashars ulterior meaning. In the absence of a narrative context, as in most midrashic literature, the normative presence of the nimshal as part of the mashal must therefore be understood as a device of compen sation for the missing narrative, or as a way of replacing it: instead of a narrative context to give the mashal its ad hoc meaning, there is an exegetical one, but with an equally ad hoc meaning of its own.24 Yet this raison d'?tre for the nimshal's presence in the mashal takes on even greater significance if it is borne in mind that an over-all tendency of midrashic literature in general is always to subordinate every context? narrative, historical, sociological?to the all-encompassing context of Torah, literally to make the words of Torah embrace everything in the universe.25 Viewed from this perspective, the normative presence of the nimshal is simply a token of the mashal's midrashic context, the salient indication of the adaptation of the literary form of the mashal and its tradition to the new exigencies and requirements of the mid rashic program. It is to this "midrashizing" of the mashal that the nimshal testifies, not to its allegorization. In all other respects, the nimshal's function differs in no way from a narrative context's, a fact that is further confirmed by the form in which the nimshal is usually presented: Rarely does it give an exhaustive explanation for the mashal proper; instead it tells us only enough so that we do not miss the point of the allusive tale told in the mashal-proper, and particularly its scrip tural connection. In fact, it is not uncommon for the nimshal to consist solely of a prooftext (as in the meshalim cited as 11:2 and 111:1) if that is all the context needed to grasp the mashal's meaning. If the form of the nimshal can thus vary widely, its normative presence in the mashal is still the first indication of the process of regularization which I have proposed that this literary form undergoes in midrashic literature. The two other significant features of this pro cess of regularization both pertain directly to the mashal-proper's nar rative. First, as the mashal becomes a representative device of midrashic exegesis, its narrative is increasingly assimilated to the literary form of the king-mashal, in which its leading character or protagonist is usually a king, while the other personae who figure in the narrative are members of the royal court, like the king's advisers and counsellors, his generals, the soldiers in his army, and his subjects. Now the use of the king as a conventional symbol for God and His sovereign rule over the universe derives from the Bible and pervades rabbinic liturgy.26 But since Ignaz Ziegler's monumental study of the king-mashal at the beginning of this century, it has been recognized that the features of the king portrayed in the king-mashal are modelled upon those of the Roman emperor?or if not upon the emperor himself, then upon his procurator, and later pro-consul, in Palestine.27 Although this does not mean, as Ziegler appears to have believed, that the meshalim all refer to</page><page sequence="7">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 267 historically factual, or verifiable, incidents,28 it does show how pro foundly familiar the Rabbis were with the greater political and cultural world in which they lived, and with what little hesitation they trans formed the realia of that world into subject matter for midrash.29 The diction of the king-mashal is suffused with Greek words and terms borrowed from the imperial court and its institutions, and as Saul Lieb erman has shown, some meshalim are virtually unintelligible if we do not understand the historical incidents to which their narratives allude.30 Aside from governing its composition, the regularization of the mashal to the form of the king-mashal is also reflected in the transmis sion of some meshalim. In the relatively few cases where we possess the same mashal in both Tannaitic and Amoraic versions, and where the protagonist in the earlier source is an ordinary person, like an adam, a man, the latter version invariably changes the adam into a melekh, even though the narrative does not at all require him to be a king;31 in a few cases, this same phenomenon can be observed even in some Tannaitic meshalim which are repeated elsewhere as transmitted by a later Tanna.32 Finally, the centrality that the king-mashal comes to assume in the tradition of the mashal at large is also indicated by the standard formula with which most meshalim begin (numbered as part 2 on my translations)?mashal . . . lemelekh she-. . . , "it is like ... a king who . . ."?which is used even in meshalim in which the king himself is not the protagonist but only a marginal character.33 It should be noted that this tendency to turn every mashal into a king-mashal was never a programmatic one: just as there are king meshalim from the Tannaitic period that antedate the regularization of the mashal in its other aspects, so also non-king-meshalim continue to be composed in the Amoraic period when the process of regularization is at its strongest.34 The overall phenomenon, however, is closely related to the second major feature of the process of regularization, which is the use in the mashal-proper of stereotyped narrative struc tures, motifs, and virtually formulaic diction to express those struc tures and motifs. For example, when a darshan, or preacher, wished to cast his narrative into a specific form in order best to serve the rhetor ical end he desired, he had at his disposal a number of conventional structures. The most common of these is the simple past tense narra tive which follows the introductory formula mashal lemah hadavar domeh, le-, "a mashal: to what is this like? It is like . . . ," (or one of its numerous variants35), and which draws a direct parallel between the situation or tale in its narrative and the one referred to in the nimshal. Different structures include those meshalim whose narratives in the present tense begin with the formulae benoheig shebaolam, "it is the custom of the world [for]/' or melekh basar vadam, "a king of flesh-and</page><page sequence="8">268 DAVID STERN blood . . ." and which in general stress the dissimilarity between a human king's deeds and those of the divine one, often for the purpose of condemning the Roman imperial cult and its pretensions to divinity.36 The presence of these stereotypes certainly reflects the mashal's original oral form of presentation. Their pervasive use, however, also offers us a suggestive insight into how these meshalim were actually composed in performance, through a mode or technique of composition very similar to the one literary scholars like Milman Parry and Vladimir Propp have postulated for such types of traditional literature as the Homeric epic and the folktale.37 Like these disparate traditions, the composition of the mashal through stereotypes should by no means be supposed to have been done mechanically. Instead, we must imagine that when a darshan was called upon to compose a mashal for a particu lar verse or occasion, he was able to draw upon a kind of ideal thesaurus of stereotyped, traditional elements to help him to improvise his com position under all the pressured requirements of spontaneous perfor mance. Yet the way he actually employed those stereotypes, which ones he selected, and how he combined them to create the narrative he wanted?for aims both exegetical and rhetorical?was entirely a matter of his own wish and skill. As we shall still see, stereotyping in the mashal can be identified most clearly in meshalim attributed to Amoraic darshanim, an observa tion that again implies the complete r?gularisation of the mashal's tra dition in that period; however, it is in the embryonic presence of these stereotypes in meshalim attributed to Tannaim that we can see the very workings of the process of regularization, its coming-to-be.38 Moreover, it is important to emphasize that these stereotypes?of structure, theme, and diction?are common to the tradition of the king mashal in its entirety; aside from the difference in regularization already noted between the Tannaitic and Amoraic periods, stereotyping is not limited to a single generation of Rabbis or to any one midrashic compilation. Yet only by understanding the traditional nature of the king-mashal and its mode of composition is it possible to appreciate what is otherwise an insolubly paradoxical feature of the tradition in its entirety, manifest throughout Ziegler's anthology of nearly 900 king meshalim: namely, the vast number of meshalim that share similar structures, motifs, and elements of diction even though each mashal appears to be a unique composition created anew for the verse it claims to explicate. Similarly, this explanation for the traditional mode of the mashal's composition offers us the only possibility for understanding statments in rabbinic literature that describe a darshan composing innumerable meshalim?as many as 300!?on a more or less spon taneous occasion.39</page><page sequence="9">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 269 All the traditional features of the mashal, however, do not give the entire story behind its composition; for example, the ad hoc application the nimshal provides for the mashal is often reflected as well in the mashal's narrative, usually at the conclusion of the mashal-proper. This typical phenomenon again raises the question of the relationship between the mashal and its nimshal: To what extent does the exegetical context provided for the mashal-proper in the nimshal actually exhaust the meaning of the mashal's narrative? Or to put this question other wise: How does the mashal successfully integrate and exploit the resources of its two dimensions, the rhetorical (as embodied in the mashal-proper) and the exegetical (as presented in the nimshal)? To answer these questions, I propose now to turn to a typical mashal which I will analyze for its traditional elements by comparing it to cognate meshalim that share common motifs and elements of diction. In this way, it will be possible for us to show how its author applied traditional stereotypes from the ideal thesaurus I have described to fit the ad hoc requirements of the prooftext he interprets; at the same time, we will be able to isolate what it is about the mashal that is unique to it. The reader is asked to turn to the appendix which contains the versions of the mashal; since we shall be continually referring back to these texts in the following pages, it would be of immeasurable help to the reader to take the time now to read through these passages. The analysis I offer for this mashal will also, I hope, serve as a methodolog ical example to be followed in analyzing other meshalim. The mashal, attributed to R. Eleazar b. Pedat, is found in Lamenta tions Rabba (Lam. R.), an "early" Amoraic midrash, and is told in refer ence to Lam. 4:11:40 "The Lord has spent His anger, poured out His blazing wrath; He has kindled a fire in Zion that has consumed her foundations." The first two meshalim cited and translated in the appendix are two versions of this mashal; the first, 1:1, is the text found in Buber's edition of Lam. R. (hereafter cited as Buber), and the second, 1:2, the mashal as printed in the standard editions of Midrash Rabba (hereafter cited as MR). Between these versions there exist several differences in matters of diction, two of which should be given special notice. First, to describe how the son angered his father, Buber reads simply hikh'iso, "he angered him," while MR has veyats'a beno letarbut ra ah, "his son turned to wickedness." Second, to express the motif dealing with the destruction of the bridal-chamber, Buber uses only the single verb vesatrah; in contrast, MR reads the more elaborate and trebled formula, "he went up to the bridal-chamber, and tore its curtains, and broke its foundations." In both cases, MR's text is lengthier but, as our analysis will show, the diction used in it and in Buber is equally traditional?that is, attested in other meshalim?and hence corres</page><page sequence="10">270 DAVID STERN pondingly authentic from the point of view of the tradition at large.41 Apart from these differences in diction, however, both texts present the same exegesis of Lam. 4:11 and the identical narrative. This narrative, for the purposes of our analysis, can be divided into two major motifs: one, the account of the king's construction and de struction of the bridal-chamber; two, the portrait of the pedagogue's paradoxical behavior. The first motif, in turn, can be treated as a combi nation of three smaller motifs, or motemes: the construction of the bridal-chamber; the son's provocation of his father; and the destruction of the bridal-chamber. As it happens, the first and third of these motemes?and the second one, though less explicitly?are already attested in a Tannaitic mashal, cited as 11:1 in the appendix. The mashal, found in Sanh?drin 108a, is attributed to R. Joshua b. Karha who uses it to explicate Gen. 7:23 and to explain why God destroyed both men and beasts in the Flood when mankind alone had sinned and therefore deserved to be punished. Aside from its intrinsic relevance to our subject, this mashal also happens to be one of the few examples I have already mentioned of a Tannaitic mashal that is elsewhere transmitted in the name of an Amora: in this case, R. Pinhas who, in Gen. R. 28:6 (cited as 11:2), employs it to respond to the same theological problem Gen. 6:7 raises for him as did Gen. 7:23 for R. Joshua.42 Between these Tannaitic and Amoraic versions of the mashal, however, there are several notable differences that are highly revealing for what they show of the process of regularization the mashal underwent in the course of its transmis sion. First, the protagonist of the Tannaitic mashal, an adam, is changed in the Amoraic version into a melekh: this is precisely that tendency of the tradition to regularize all meshalim into the form of the king mashal which has already been noted. Second, the narrative of R. Pin has's mashal is substantially more coherent than it is in R. Joshua's: in the latter, the son dies inexplicably, while in the former, the king kills him because he has angered him. Third, the diction of the Amoraic mashal is also stereotyped in a way that it is not in the Tannaitic mashal. Note, for example, the constant trebling of actions and phrases in the Amoraic version, none of which are in the Tannaitic one, and its use of such stereotyped phrases as "began to break its supports, to tear down its walls, and to rip apart its curtains" (which is virtually identical to I:2's "the king went up . . . its foundations") and "he made a bridal canopy . . . and plastered, cemented, and decorated it" (sheasah beit hu pah . . . vesiyyedah vekiyyerah vetsiyyerah),^ which is found in all the Amoraic versions cited thus far?1:1,1:2, and 11:1?as well as in 11:3 and 11:4. The presence of the stereotype in the latter two meshalim is espe cially revealing since it shows how this m?teme with its formulaic</page><page sequence="11">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 271 diction comprises an independent unit that can be combined with other motemes and motifs to compose entirely different meshalim for distinct exegetical and rhetorical purposes. As an independent unit, the stereo type can be formulated thus: [It is like a king who] made a bridal-chamber for . . . and plastered, cemented, and decorated it. It should be observed that the identity of the person for whom the king builds the bridal-chamber?be it himself, his daughter, or his son?does not affect the stereotype or its diction. Although in all the meshalim I have discussed the one who builds the bridal-chamber is the king, this action could be performed by another character?an instance of the independence of function (or action) and agent that was first pointed out by Propp in connection with the Russian folktale.44 The second m?teme in our mashal in Lam. R.?describing the son's provocation of his father?is also a stereotyped motif; however, the diction used to express it has several variants: hikh'iso (1:1), kaas hamelekh 'al beno (11:2), veyats'a beno letarbut ra ah (1:2)?with the fact that the king thereby becomes angry at the son to be understood). The difference between the first two variants is too minor to be discussed, but the third variant appears to be one associated specifically with the figure of the pedagogue. Note, for example, the mashal listed as 111:1 (which in Gen. R. 28:6 immediately precedes 11:2, R. Pinhas's mashal) in which the pedagogue is described as actively leading the son into wickedness (vehotsi'o letarbut ra ah). Although this mashal also uses the phrase kaas 'al heno, it may very well be that MR's text of our Lam. R. mashal uses the less common stereotype because of the pedagogue's presence in it.45 Finally, the diction used to describe the king's destruction of the bridal-chamber is correspondingly stereotyped. While Buber's single verb vesatrah is a bare expression of the m?teme, it is reminiscent of the earliest Tannaitic version's upizer (11:1). On the other hand, there is an obvious similarity between MR's "the king went up to . . . and broke its foundations" (1:2) and Gen. R.'s "he entered . . . and to rip apart its curtains" (11:2); in addition, these two stereotypes are both trebled in their actions. In the latter mashal (11:2), the king kills his son, and in his grief over his act he then destroys the bridal-chamber. In our Lam. R. mashal, in contrast, the king solely destroys the bridal-chamber; he does not think of killing his son?which is, to be sure, the point of the mashal, as the pedagogue himself explains at the narrative's conclusion. But what is the connection between the pedagogue and the preceding narrative? There are, in fact, several alternative courses of action the pedagogue is represented in different meshalim as performing in response to the motif of the king who becomes angry at his son. In R. Yudan's mashal</page><page sequence="12">272 DAVID STERN (111:1), for example, the pedagogue's role is directly analogous to that of the bridal-chamber in R. Pinhas's mashal (11:2) which directly follows it in Gen. R. 28:6: after the king kills his son, he kills the pedagogue, just as he had destroyed the bridal-chamber and for the same reason.46 In a mashal in Midrash Psalms 90:1 (111:2), the king's courtier or philos (ohavo),*7 a character very much like the pedagogue, serves a different function: he saves the son from his father's anger, on account of which the king rewards him. Finally, in another mashal in Midrash Psalms (111:3), the pedagogue plays a third, still different role in relation to the motif of the angry king48?as his emissary to the son whom he finds singing and weeping over the punishment he has received from his father. Although in this mashal the son himself sings and weeps, he behaves almost exactly like the pedagogue does in our mashal in Lam. R. Despite the different personae to whom this motif of paradoxical behavior is attributed, the two meshalim nonetheless share the iden tical sequence of motifs: 1) Catastrophe (king destroys bridal-chamber; king banishes son49) 2) Paradoxical behavior (on the part of the pedagogue or son) 3) Dialogue (explaining paradoxical behavior) For all the differences between them, it is significant that in both meshalim the catastrophes that respectively instigate the conclusions of their narratives are explicitly described as surrogate ones that have been substituted for more severe punishments the king could have executed; indeed, it is precisely this act of substitution that in each mashal serves to anticipate its other motif of paradoxical behavior.50 At least one more mashal cognate to our mashal in Lam. R. could be discussed.51 For the present time, however, this preliminary survey of meshalim will suffice to demonstrate how R. Eleazar, in composing his mashal for Lam. 4:11, drew upon the ideal thesaurus of traditional motifs and diction whose existence I have postulated. Yet all the tradi tional features of R. Eleazar's mashal still do not explain either the way in which R. Eleazar chose to combine them in his composition, or the rhetorical function they serve. To understand these other aspects of the mashal, it is necessary for us to consider the mashal's exegetical context and the force it exerts in determining the mashal's literary form. As our mashal's nimshal immediately clarifies, the pedagogue in the mashal-proper symbolizes Asaph,52 and the reply the pedagogue gives to the question why he sings and does not weep is also a response to the question first asked in the illustrand preceding the mashal (numbered as part 1): Why does Ps. 79?a psalm traditionally associated with the destruction of the Temple53?begin "A song of Asaph," and not "a weeping" or "lament" of Asaph? As we know, the answer the nimshal gives is that the relentless account of the Destruction in Ps. 79 is para</page><page sequence="13">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 273 doxically spoken out of joyous relief, not despair. Why? Because God destroyed the Temple alone, and not Israel and its people; indeed, the mashal implies that the reason why God destroyed only the Temple? for Asaph, just "trees and stones"?was because He intentionally re strained His wrath against Israel. This interpretation of Ps. 79 is then applied to Lam. 4:11, which R. Eleazar also interprets as a verse describ ing God's ultimate mercy to the people of Israel. According to the mashal's exegesis, the verse reads, in effect, "And He hath kindled a fire in Zion which hath not devoured Zion, but only the foundations there of." By destroying the Temple, God paradoxically spared Israel. As the very image of the bridal-chamber suggests, the Temple is portrayed in the mashal as merely a makeshift, temporary construction, intention ally built in this way so that God could destroy it in order to spare the people of Israel from the utter destruction they deserved for their transgressions.54 This reading of the verse is a radically literalist one, almost a diyyuk of sorts. Although there is no obvious exegetical problem in the verse that would have given rise to it, R. Eleazar may have understood the verb kilah not in the sense of "He gave full vent" to His anger but as "He completed it."55 It is also possible that the interpretation is based upon a typical case of midrashic paranomasia with a pun on the root k-l-h and the similar root k-l-aleph, thus actually making the verse read "God restrained His anger" and so on. But what has instigated this unusually literalist interpretation? One likely explanation for it is an apologetic one, a reply to the accusa tion frequently made against the Jews in the third and fourth centuries, and well-documented in Christian polemical literature of the period, that the destruction of the Temple and the calamitous fate of the Jews in its aftermath conclusively proved that God had rejected His people. In Adversos Judaeos, Chap. 13, for example, Tertullian claims that because the Jews "had committed these crimes, and had failed to understand that Christ 'was to be found' in 'the time of their visitation,' their land has been made 'desert, and their cities utterly burnt with fire, while strangers devour their region in their site: the daughter of Zion is derelict/" and so on.56 These lines are largely compounded out of verses from Isaiah (55:6, 7 and 1:7, 8, 4), but to make much the same point Tertullian could have quoted Lam. 4:11, if he had so wished. R. Elea zar's interpretation can be seen as a response to precisely this reading to which Tertullian and others might have given the verse?and which, not incidentally, is not very far from its plain sense. Yet if only on account of this plain sense of the verse we can appreciate a second, even more decisive motive behind R. Eleazar's reinterpretation of it. Even without an exegetical or syntactic difficulty in the verse, and even without the external pressure of anti-Jewish</page><page sequence="14">274 DAVID STERN polemic, the very survival of Judaism in the aftermath of the Destruc tion precluded the possibility of taking the verse in its plain sense, as testimony to God's unmitigated wrath against Zion. If every verse in Scripture is prophetic revelation of divine truth (and Lamentations itself was believed by the Rabbis to have been a prophetic text57), a plain or literal interpretation of a verse like Lam. 4:11?for even a literal reading is still an "interpretation"?could never have been correct because it would have contradicted every belief and perception Jews held about their world, their place in it, and the continuity?albeit, perhaps, temporarily disrupted?of their transcendental, covenantal relationship with God. In the face of these beliefs and perceptions, it was precisely the task of midrash to confirm the veracity of Scripture by salvaging from the wreckage a verse like Lam. 4:11 that describes the very source for hope in the aftermath of the Destruction. And in this way, the Rabbis also salvaged meaning?that is to say, an abiding truth?from the catastrophe they had suffered. The rhetorical function of R. Eleazar's mashal can therefore be described as an apologetic one. It responds to such polemical arguments as those made by Tertullian, but it also serves to counter the awesome despair Jews themselves felt after the Destruction. But the rhetoric of the mashal goes beyond the purely apologetic character of R. Eleazar's exegesis of Lam. 4:11, as can be seen if we now return to the question of the relationship between the mashal and its nimshal, and to the structure of the narrative itself. In the first place, it is necessary to emphasize that the relationship between the mashal and the interpreta tion of Lam. 4:11 given in the nimshal is an artificial one. On a phe nomenological level as well as on a compositional one, the interpreta tion of Lam. 4:11 precedes the mashal-proper and its narrative. Aside from this being true on logical grounds, it can also be proven by the simple observation that the final statement of the pedagogue in the mashal-proper?his response to the question why he sings and does not weep?is modelled upon the response of Asaph in the nimshal which is convincing only within the context of the interpretation of the proof text Lam. 4:11. Yet if the mashal-proper's narrative does not actually produce the interpretation of the prooftext, then what is the connection between the verse and the narrative, that allusive tale? The relationship, as I have just suggested, is a rhetorical one: the mashal-proper is made to seem as though it produces the exegesis of Lam. 4:11, and the verse, once reinterpreted, is then used to authenticate the significance of the narrative, to give it the authoritative stamp of Scripture. The internal hermeneutics of the mashal is therefore consciously self-reflexive, even circular, and in pursuing this circularity, the mashal strategically justi fies itself as a rhetorical device for interpreting Scripture.</page><page sequence="15">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 275 How exactly it does this can be deduced from the structure of the mashal-proper's narrative. As we saw before, the two motifs that com prise this narrative?the account of the king's construction and de struction of the bridal-chamber, and the portrait of the pedagogue's paradoxical behavior?are both traditional ones; what is not traditional is the way R. Eleazar has combined them into a continuous narrative. What does this combination mean? The pedagogue's behavior is, of course, the way he reacts to the king's destruction of the bridal chamber. Yet as a reaction, and as the pedagogue himself proceeds to explain, his singing is also the narrative equivalent of an interpretation of the king's action. Within its own narrative, in other words, R. Elea zar's mashal provides a model for the activity of interpretation. Just as the pedagogue explains his paradoxical behavior, so the equally para doxical logic of the interpretation itself?first, of Asaph's singing in Ps. 79:1; then, of the exegesis of Lam. 4:11?is also explained and thereby justified. The narrative of the mashal is therefore itself about interpretation. Yet in providing a model of this kind for the interpretative activity, the mashal goes beyond merely fulfilling a rhetorical function. It also assumes a cognitive value, telling us something in its own right?in this case, and in a way that is not easily paraphrased, about the inherently paradoxical character of interpretation, and about the conditions under which interpretation becomes necessary. In our mashal, it may appear so obvious to us that it is unnecessary to note that the historical condi tions to which the narrative alludes are those surrounding the destruc tion of the Temple. Nonetheless, it is important to add that this application of the motif describing the construction and destruction of the bridal-chamber is, in fact, an ad hoc one, dictated by the exegetical context of Lam. 4:11; in the meshalim listed under 11:1-4, the same symbolism refers to entirely different events, like the Flood. The same ad hoc specificity is true of the pedagogue who, aside from Asaph, can symbolize figures as diverse as Moses, David, and the beasts destroyed in the Flood. Yet the paradoxical behavior in which the pedagogue indulges also is not solely a traditional motif arbitrarily employed in the mashal; within the exegetical context in which R. Eleazar uses it, the motif points to the truly contradictory ways in which Jews may have actually responded to the trauma of the Destruction: nearly identical behavior is elsewhere attributed to no one less than R. Akiva.58 Given these facts, it is not reading too much into the mashal to suggest that the pedagogue's behavior may even symbolize the figure of the darshan in the aftermath of the Destruction. On the one hand, the joy out of which the pedagogue sings reveals the irrepressible urge with which the Rabbis used midrash, and invented rhetorical forms for it, to over come the trauma they had endured; on the other, the astonishment the</page><page sequence="16">276 DAVID STERN mashal itself represents at the seemingly inappropriate behavior of the pedagogue is directly commensurable to the astonished awe the audience of the mashal feels at the boldness of an exegetical strategy like R. Eleazar's. Not all meshalim are nearly quite as self-referential as R. Eleazar's composition, but every one serves an analogous rhetorical function. In my study of the meshalim of Lam. R., I have identified at least six different functions, including apologetics, polemics, condemnation, and complaint?all of which are species of the general function of blame?in addition to lamentation and paraenesis; still other meshalim serve dif ferent functions, like praise and consolation.59 These rhetorical func tions, however, are distinct from the exegetical dimension of the mashal which, in the past, has erroneously been described as the didactic function of most rabbinic meshalim;60 rather, exegesis? midrash of Torah?is the context in which the mashal assumes its rhetorical charge, the field in which its narrative takes on meaning. But there is nothing simply didactic about these meshalim except that they all have an ulterior meaning which they call upon their audiences to grasp for themselves. This last distinction is worth dwelling upon for a moment since it suggests the basis for a map of midrashic discourse which can at once differentiate between its rhetorical and exegetical dimensions and locate the point at which these two orders intersect. In literary forms like the mashal, midrashic exegesis?what I called at the beginning of this article its micro-structure?is used merely as raw material, as it were, for compositions whose intended purpose moves far beyond exegesis, and which themselves organize exegesis into the macro structures of midrashic literature. But the rabbinic mashal, as we have seen, also assumes its normative, regularized form only within its mid rashic context; its rhetorical shape, the presence of the nimshal in it, directly reflects the adaptation of the genre to the requirements of midrash. This means, then, that forms like the king-mashal or the petihta (for which Heinemann has postulated an analogous function, albeit within a more formally liturgical context61) can accurately be called the literary creations of midrash and of the occasions on which it was customarily practiced. Insofar as the regularization and normative use of these forms was largely accomplished in the Amoraic period, they can also be attributed to the literary achievement of the Amoraim, and since these are the forms that best characterize Amoraic midrash, they distinguish this literary achievement from other kinds of Palestin ian literature in Late Antiquity that also reflect midrashic activity.62 Finally, the treatment of midrashic discourse I have applied in these pages by way of example to the mashal argues that the most complete appreciation of the complexity and richness of midrash can be reached</page><page sequence="17">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 277 only through a literary approach to its deployment of language; such an approach alone can account not only for its content but for its forms, and for the intention behind those forms as well. If this concluding statement might be entitled the nimshal of this article, my plea for the privileged position of a literary approach to midrash has been its ulte rior purpose, and my argument throughout its own mashal, as it is written, "Do not treat the mashal lightly, for it is through the mashal that a man is able to understand the words of Torah" (Song of Songs R. 1:1:8)63 The University of Judaism</page><page sequence="18">278 DAVID STERN APPENDIX 1:1 Lam. R. 4:11 (Buber, p. 148) 1) "And He hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof" (Lam. 4:11). It is written, "A song of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance" (Ps. 79:1). A song! It should have said, "A weeping"! R. Eleazar said: 2) It is like (mashal le-) 3) a king who made a bridal-chamber (she'asah hupah) for his son. He fixed the house (tiken beilo), plastered, cemented, and decorated it (giyyedah vesiyyedah vetsiyyerah). One time his son angered him, and the king destroyed the bridal chamber (pa'am ahat hikh'iso vesatrah). The pedagogue sat down and began to sing. [A person] said to him, "The king has destroyed his house (hamelekh harav beito), and you sit and sing!" He said to him, "For this reason (lekakh) I sing: because he poured out his anger (sheshafakh hamato) upon his son's bridal chamber, and not upon his son." 4) Similarly (kakh), people said to Asaph, "The Holy One, blessed be He, has destroyed His temple, and you sit and sing!" He said to them, "For this reason (lekakh) I sing: because the Holy One, blessed be He, poured out His anger upon trees and stones, and not upon Israel." 5) That is what is written. "And He hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof." 1:2 Lam. R. 4:11 (Midrash Rabba 4:14, p. 56) 1) And He hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof? (Lam. 4:11). It is written, "A song of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance" (Ps. 79:1). Should not the verse have said, "A weeping of Asaph," or "a lament of Asaph," or "a dirge of Asaph"? What does "a song of Asaph" mean? 2) But it is like (eia mashal le-) 3) a king who made a bridal-chamber (she'asah beit hupah) for his son, and plastered, cemented and decorated it (vesiyyedah vekiyyerah vetsiyyerah).

Ps. 90:1 (Buber, p. 390) 1) "A prayer of Moses, the man of God" (Ps. 90:1). It was necessary to say only "A prayer of Moses." Why does it also say, "the man of God"? 2) It is like (mashal le-) 3) a king who became angry at (sheka'as 'al) his son and wished to kill him. The [king's] courtier (ohavo) said to him, "I beg you, forgive him, and do not kill him." He restrained himself ('amad) and did not kill him. The next day the king began to say, "If I had killed my son, 1 would have hurt (makhshil) only myself. But now I should thank my courtier who begged for pity for my son. So from now I will make him a father to kings (av lemelakhim). 4) Similarly (kakh), the Holy One, blessed be He, said, "Let me alone, that I may destroy them" (Deut. 9:14). Moses said to Him, "And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me" (Num. 11:15). And what is written afterwards? "And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy words" (Num. 14:20). Afterwards, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, "If I had killed Israel I would only have hurt myself. But I must therefore thank Moses who begged for pity for them"?as it is said, "And Moses besought the Lord his God" (Ex. 32:11)?"I will pay him honor, and call him a father of prophets, a father of angels, a father of those who pray." 5) This is the meaning of "A prayer of Moses, the man of God."</page><page sequence="21">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 281 111:3 Mid. Ps. 3:1 (Buber, p. 34) 1) Another interpretation of "A song of David" (Ps. 3:1). When did David recite this song? When he "went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet, and wept as he went up" (2 Sam. 15:30). But if he wept, then why did he sing? And if he sang, then why did he weep? R. Abba b. Kahana said: 2) A mashal. To what is it like? It is like (mashal, lemah hadavar domeh le-) 3) a king who became angry at (sheka'as 'al) his son, and banished him (vetardo) from his palace.

The son said to him, "I am weeping because I angered my father, and I am singing because he did not condemn me to death but only to banishment. And not only did he not execute me, but he ban ished me to a province of commanders and prefects!" 4) R.

Elijah fled, as it is said, "And he went in the strength of that food forty days and nights until Horeb the mountain of God" (1 Kings 19:8). So I will flee like them. He began to say, "I remembered Thy judgements of old, O Lord, and have comforted myself (Ps. 119:52)?I remembered the principle of justice by which you led my predeces sors, and you have consoled me. When did David say this? [When] "David said unto all his servants that were with him in Jerusalem, Arise and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us" (2 Sam. 15.14). Rav and R. Yudan [offered interpretations of this verse]. Rav said: So that he will not judge us like a condemned city ('ir hani dahat). R. Yudan said: Once the owner of the cup begins to clean it, he does not stop until he has utterly cleansed it.

The application of the middot to midrashic exegesis was, of course, the primary interest of the classical commentators on Midrash Rabba, foremost among them Wolf Einhorn (MaHaRZU, 1856); see in particular the introduction to his commentary, printed in all classical editions of Midrash Rabba, with its gloss on the so-called "Beraita" of R. Eliezer. On the Beraita, which is now recognized to be Geonic in origin, cf. H. G. Enelow, Mishnato shel R. Eliezer (New York, 1933); M. Zucker, "Towards the Solution of the Problem of the 32 Middot and The Mishnat R. Eliezer'" [Hebrew], PAAJR 21-23 (1952-54), 1-39. Heinemann, in Darkhei ha'aggadah, does not deal directly with the traditional middot, but the principles and techniques he proposes for midrash are analogous to them in many respects. 4.

Aside from its use to denote the genre of parables and fables, the term mashal, or its Aramaic cognate matla, is also employed, as it is in the Bible as well, to refer to proverbial sayings and exemplae in general; cf. . . Bacher, 'Erkhei midrash, trans. A. . Rabinowitz (Tel Aviv, 1923), vol. 1, p. 84; vol. 2, pp. 231-32. For the use of the term as an exegetical category, see the insightful remarks of R. Loewe, "The 'Plain' Meaning of Scripture in Early Jewish Exegesis," Papers of the Institute for Jewish Studies, London, 1 (1964), 141-85.

I. Abrahams, "The Parables," Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels (1917; New York, 1967), 90-107; J. Petuchowski, "The Theological Significance of the Parable in Rabbinic Literature and the New Testament," Christian News from Israel, 23-24 (1972-74), 76-86. 9. Unless otherwise indicated, I have accepted all meshalim recorded in Tannaitic literature as Tannaitic; all attributed meshalim in Amoraic literature as attributed; and anonymous meshalim in Amoraic literature as Amoraic. I have not presumed to date any meshalim on stylistic grounds, though once our knowledge of the mashal's style has been further sophisticated along the lines outlined in this article it may very well be possible to do this. 10. For paroimia, "proverb" or "maxim," see the Septuagint on Prov. 1:1; for thrulema, "byword," Job 17:6; for ainigma, "riddle," Deut. 28:37; ainigmatistfs, "a riddler," Num. 21:27; and in addition, apsanismon, "byword," 1 Kings 9:7; and threnos, "lament," Isa. 14:4, Mie. 2:4. 11.

As a literary term, parabole is used as early as Plato's Timaeus (40c4) and Philebus (33b2), but the locus classicus for its definition as a rhetorical term is Aristotle's Rhetoric (2:20:1393 b4-8): The parabole is the sort of argument Socrates used: e.g. "Public officials ought not to be selected by lot. That is like using the lot to select athletes, instead of choosing those who are fit for the contest; or using the lot to select a steersman from among a ship's crew, as if we ought to take the man on whom the lot falls, and not the man who knows most about it.

For a concise review of the different positions taken in regard to these questions, see Kermode, The Genesis of Secrecy, pp. 28-34, 41-45, and sources cited therein. 21. Cf. Guttmann, Hamashal bitekufat hatannaim, pp. 75-77; Flusser, pp. 207-9. 22. Although the proof text is listed apart from the nimshal, it can in some meshalim serve as the entire nimshal, as I explain further below. 23. This is the position that has been consistently taken in regard to the explanatory nimshalim attributed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels; for sources, see the literature cited in note 14 above; Jeremias, 103-14; Kissinger, passim. In the case of the rabbinic mashal, no one has seriously called into question the authenticity of the nimshal, but see the remarks of Guttmann, pp. 70-75. To be sure, Johnston, pp. 636-39, correctly concludes from his study of Tannaitic meshalim that nearly all of them include a nimshal, but he attempts no explanation for this; in comparison, Flusser, pp. 150-52 and 195 ff, argues for the originality of the nimshal to the mashal, but this is because he believes that the mashal is allegorical. 24. Nagy, The Best of the Achaeans, pp. 281-83, has shown that virtually the same logic of compensation underlies the origin of the epimythia or morals attached to the fables of Aesop in such late anthologies as those of Babrius and Phaedrus. But where, according to Nagy, the epimythium compensates by displacement for the original narrative context pre served in the Aesopic Vitae, the nimshal's presence in the mashal is testimony to the latter's original midrashic context, as I argue further below. For a different view of the function of the epimythium, however, cf. . E. Perry, The Origin of the Epimythium," TAPA 71 (1940), 391-419. 25. Cf. Avot 5:22: "All is in Torah," and for an insightful gloss on this tendency in midrash, see Michael Fishbane, "Torah and Tradition," in D. A. Knight, ei., Tradition and Theology in the Old Testament (London, 1977), pp. 275-300. 26. Cf., for biblical examples of kingship-imagery, Exod. 15:18, Isa. 24:23, Ps. 93:1, and 1 Chron. 16:31; for rabbinic liturgical sources, the 'aleinu, the malkhuyyot section of the Rosh Hashanna musaf, and the opening berakhah formula; cf. Joseph Heinemann, Prayer in the Talmud, trans. R. Sarason (Berlin, 1977), pp. 32-33, 93-97, and literature cited in the notes therein, especially note 26, concerning different scholarly views about the reason for the mention of God's kingship in the berakhah formula; Heinemann, among others, argues that it was included as a protest against the emperor-cult and that it became halakhically compulsory only during the Amoraic period?two facts that may be relevant to the regularization of the king-mashal, as I describe it below. 27. Ziegler, Die K?nigsgleichnisse, pp. xxii-xxiii, xxviff; S. Krauss, Paras veRomi batalmud uvemidrashim (Jerusalem, 1948), pp. 34-36, 40. and note 30 where he refutes Ziegler and</page><page sequence="25">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 285 claims that any high officer in the emperor's court or service might have been called a melekh by the Rabbis. 28. Obvious as this may seem to us, the king-meshalim have been used uncritically as historical sources by very distinguished historians; cf., for example, M. Avi-Yonah, The Jews of Palestine: A Political History from the Bar Kokhba War to the Arab Conquest (1962; New York, 1976), pp. 91-93. 29. For a very controversial interpretation of an instance in which the Rabbis used such realia for midrash, see Morton Smith's discussion of imperial-icon imagery in many meshalim in "The Image of God," BJRL 40 (1958), 481-88; Smith calls attention to meshalim in Lev. R. 34:3, Mekhilta (Bahodesh 8), Deut. R. 2:21, and Exod. R. 30:16.1 do not, however, agree with Smith's claims that all these meshalim necessarily point to the resurgence of anthropomorphic doctrines by some Rabbis or that the later rabbinic tradi tion suppressed expressions of those doctrines. 30. For an extensive list of Greek loan-words and terms used in the king-meshalim, see Ziegler, at the end of his book; Lieberman, Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, pp. 4-5, where he discusses the mashal in Exod. R. 15:12 in connection with an incident involving Diocletian and recorded by Lactantius. 31. For an example of this phenomenon, see my discussion below on the meshalim in Sanh?drin 108a and Gen. R. 28:6 (11:1 and 11:2 in the appendix). This tendency to assimila tion has been discussed by Guttmann, p. 36, and Flusser, pp. 152 f., both of whom, however, regard it as a "late" feature of the tradition; the same has been true of scholarly treatments of the phenomenon in the synoptic parables. For example, not a single central character in the parables of Jesus is a king, and where a king does appear in them, his presence can be shown to be a product of later redactional activity or transmission; the sole exception to this rule is the parable of the nobleman and his three servants in Luke 19:11-27, but in Matthew's version (25:13-30), there is no mention of kingship; similarly, in the parable of the banquet, Matthew (22:1-14) speaks of a king, while Luke (14:16-24) does not; cf. Flusser, p. 143. But all of this simply proves my argument; there is no question that the parables Jesus spoke were not yet regularized in their form and structure. 32. For such Tannaitic meshalim, cf. Mekhilta Beshalah 2 (anonymous) and Pesikta deRab Kahana 11:3 (R. Ishmael); Mekhilta Beshalah 4 (R. Abshalom the Elder) and Exod. R. 21:8 (R. Abtulis the Elder); Mekhilta Bahodesh 6 (R. Gamliel II) and Abodah Zarah 54b (R. Gamliel II); Sifre Deut. 356 (anonymous) and Sifre Deut. 19 (anonymous); Sukka 29a (the Rabbis) and Tosefta Sukka 2.6 (the Rabbis); Avot deR. Nathan A 1 (R. Shimeon b. Yohai) and Avot deR. Nathan 1 (Rabbi). In a number of these meshalim, it should be noted, the differences between them go far beyond merely the change from adam to melekh, and in some of them, even their nimshalim are completely different. 33. It should be emphasized that this formula and its emphasis upon the king is purely a matter of stylization; it does not necessarily bear upon the remainder of the mashal's narrative, let alone its ulterior message. The failure to understand this has been the source of regrettable confusion in past scholarship where much has sometimes been made of discrepancies between the formula and the narrative following it; the term for such discrepancies is "transference of the point of comparison." For a history of the term, cf. Johnston, pp. 539 f., and for the kinds of errors to which it can lead, see Norman Perrin's interpretation (actually derived from Jeremias) of the parable of the children in the marketplace, in Rediscovering the Teaching of Jesus (New York, 1976), pp. 85-87. 34. Since there is no complete collection of Amoraic meshalim, it is impossible to say exactly what percentage of them are king-meshalim. In Lam. R.?which is probably as representative an Amoraic midrash as any other?there are twenty-one king-meshalim and two non-king-meshalim, a ratio of more than ten to one. In Johnston's anthology of Tannaitic meshalim, he lists approximately 130 king-meshalim out of a total of 324 examples; in comparison, Ziegler has roughly 800 post-Tannaitic king-meshalim. On</page><page sequence="26">286 DAVID STERN account of problems of attribution and non-critical texts, however, these figures must all remain highly approximate ones. 35. For an exhaustive listing of all variants to this formula, see Guttmann, pp. 7-12, where he lists 75 examples though only the first 23 are actually relevant to the mashal. 36. On rabbinic opposition to the imperial cult, cf. E. E. Urbach, 'The Laws of Idolatry in the Light of Historical and Archaeological Facts in the Third Century" [Hebrew], Ereiz Yisrael 5 (1958), 199 ff; idem, HaZaL [The Sages] (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 74-76; in both works, Urbach cites numerous relevant meshalim. 37. Adam Parry, ed., The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry (Oxford, 1971); Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale, trans. L. Scott (1928; Austin, 1968). Cf. Albert Lord, The Singer of Tales (Camb., Mass., 1960); R. Scholes, Structuralism in Literature (New Haven, 1974), pp. 59-117; R. M. Dorson, Folklore and Fakelore (Camb., Mass., 1976), pp. 127-44. It should be noted that the concept of traditional literature, its perime ters, and workings are as yet very much in the process of being defined especially inas much as they attempt to go beyond the strictures of what has been treated until now largely within the terms of oral literature; Nagy, for example, repeatedly shows how themes and diction maintain their traditional forms in texts that postdate an oral stage of composition. Still, it seems quite clear that the category encompasses the mashal, and it is my hope that the analysis of the mashal pursued in this article will also help students of traditional literature understand their subject better. 38. Cf. Flusser, "The Parables of Jesus," for an attempt to apply Proppian, motific analyses to the Tannaitic mashal and to Jesus' parables. Flusser's article, which is now, to my mind, the definitive statement on the literary relationship between those two early traditions of the rabbinic mashal, is largely persuasive to my mind, and not only because his approach is very close to the one I pursue in this article; with him and his method, I have only two quibbles. First, on methodological grounds, Flusser tends to view the traditional elements in the mashal as a kind of deep structure, while in fact it is as much a surface phenomenon, or at least one that is evident even on the level of diction, as I go on to show in my analyses. Second, some of the common motifs Flusser tries to identify in Jesus' parables and in their rabbinic cognates are either too general?like the theme of economic relations between masters and servants or workers?or less similar than he claims them to be; cf., for example, his remarks on pp. 154 ff. But part of this problem is less Flusser's than that of his subject matter; it may be that there do not remain enough rabbinic meshalim from the early Tannaitic period for us satisfactorily to prove that the form was then a traditional one (whether or not it actually was, as is most likely); partly for this reason, I have emphasized ?ompositions from the Amoraic period in which it is far easier to identify the presence of traditional elements. 39. As, for example, in the famous story about Bar Kappara who is said to have told 300 fox-fables (mishlei shu'alim) at every course at a banquet R. Shimeon b. Rabbi once gave; Bar Kappara tells the fables in order deliberately to disrupt the banquet and thereby to avenge an insult his host once tendered him?a significant fact since it suggests that even the recitation of meshalim could have an ulterior purpose; for the sources, see Lev. R. 28:2, Eccles. R. 1:3:1, and Margoulieth's notes ad locum in his edition of Lev. R. for other parallels. The stories about Bar Kappara do not record the fables he told, but for exam ples, cf. D. Daube, "The Ancient Hebrew Fable" (The Inaugural Lecture of the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies, 17 May 1973); J. Jacobs, "Aesop's Fables Among the Jews," JE, 1, 221 f; H. Schwartzbaum, "Aesop's Fables and HaZaL's Fables" [Hebrew], Mahanayim 110-15 (1966-67), 112-17; Guttmann, Hamashal bitekufat hatannaim, pp. 54-58. The number 300 is certainly traditional; cf. Sanh?drin 38b-39a, where R. Yohanan reports that R. Meir knew 300 fables, all of which were lost after his death save for three; for attempts to reconstruct those three, cf. Rashi and MaHaRSHa ad locum, and Teshuvot Geonim, 30; interestingly, the fables, which themselves are not preserved, are referred to by their prooftexts, which suggests that even fables were used for exegetical purposes.</page><page sequence="27">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 287 For other uses of the number 300, or factors thereof, cf. the fox-fable of R. Levi in Gen. R. 78:7 where the fox in the fable claims to know 300 fables. The importance of threes and trebling in general in folk-literature has, of course, been well established; however, cf. Johnston, "Parabolic Interpretations," who writes that "it is tempting to conjecture that the phrase, Three Hundred Fables/ that occurs so often, is a reference to a standard collection which began to circulate in rabbinic circles sometime between the time of R. Johanan b. Zakkai and that of Meir" (p. 174). I doubt it, since in the story about Bar Kappara, for example, he is said to have recited 300 fables at every course, and since banquets like R. Shimeon's may have consisted of as many as eighty courses (cf. Lam. R. 3:17), Bar Kappara would have had to recite in total 24,000 meshalim! Obviously, and far more plausibly, 300 should be understood as a typical number of hyperbole, simply denoting a vast number of meshalim?though not so vast that, if we understand the traditional mode of the mashal's composition, the feat of a darshan like Bar Kappara is beyond credibility. 40. On R. Eleazar, see Buber's introduction to his edition of Lam. R., p. 24 and note therein. On the dating of Lam. R., cf. Buber, intro., pp. 9-10, who places it in the fourth century in the common era; H. Albeck, in his notes to Y. L. Zunz, Haderashot biyisrael (1832; Jerusalem, 1954), p. 342, note 90, who dates it to the late sixth century; M. D. Herr, E], 10,1376 ff., who locates its final redaction no later than the fourth century. Whatever its exact dating, however, everyone seems to agree that the compilation is from the earliest "stratum" of Amoraic midrash contemporary with such other compilations as Gen. R. 41. Aside from these two differences, the only other one worth noting is the peculiar detail in MR about the pedagogue taking a reed-flute, but this additional m?teme may be connected to a more significant difference between the structures of the two versions. As can be seen, Buber uses an additional phrase to describe the king's construction of the bridal-chamber, liken beito ("he fixed the house"), which comes between she'asah hupah liveno and giyyedah vesiyyedah vetsiyyerah; while the phrase adds nothing special to the narrative, it does help to determine the trebled structure of the narrative which thus consists of two trebled sequences of motemes: 1) [lemelekh] she'asah hupah liveno 2) liken beito 3) giyyedah vesiyyedah vetsiyyerah 1) pa am ahat hikh'iso 2) vesalrah 3) hithil pedagog yoshev umezamer This structure makes good sense since the first sequence ends with the king's construc tion of the hupah, while the second one begins with the son angering his father. In contrast, MR's structure of sequences is quite different, since its first sequence ends with the son angering his father, while the second begins with the king's destruction of the hupah. 1) [lemelekh] she'asah beit hupah liveno 2) vesiyyedah vekiyyerah vetsiyyerah 3) veyalsa heno letarbut ra ah 1) miyad 'alah hamelekh lefrupah 2) vekara et havila'ot veshiber et hakinim venatal pedagog shelo iybuv shel kinim 3) vehaya mezamer Now, as I note in the text, MR's version uses the more elaborate stereotype of vekara et havila'ot veshiber el hakinim to describe the king's destruction of the bridal-chamber; yet like the formulaic vesiyyedah vekiyyerah vetsiyyerah, and like the similar formula used in R. Pin has's mashal in Gen. R. 28:6 (hithil leshaher bekinim umakhpi'a behitsa'ot umekarea bevila ol), one</page><page sequence="28">288 DAVID STERN would expect MR's formula to be trebled in its component phrases, but it is not; instead, it has only two parts {vekara et havila'ot and veshiber et hakinim). I would therefore suggest that the puzzling phrase venatal pedagog shelo iybuv shel kinim was added in order to compensate for the missing last particle in that m?teme and to complete its internal triadic structure even though its content does not fit with the two preceding particles in the m?teme. Yet even as an imperfect gloss, this phenomenon shows how deeply entrenched is the ten dency towards trebling in the mashal's tradition if not in its transmission. 42. Cf. Ukah tov, ed. S. Buber (Vilna, 1880), 35, where R. Pinhas's mashal is also recorded but with the additional proof text of Ps. 39:5. 43. On this phrase and its variants, see Buber's note ad locum, and Theodor's com ments in his ed. of Gen. R., 69-70. 44. Propp, The Morphology of the Folktale, pp. 20 ff. 45. Such cases of assimilation by association seem to occur frequently in many meshalim, but the pattern as yet remains to be described fully. 46. Note especially the strong similarity between the statements the king makes at the conclusion of both meshalim-proper. Again, such similarities are more evidence for traditional diction and mini-structures that have been adapted for the ad hoc purposes of their respective narratives. 47. On the ohev/philos, cf. Krauss, Paras veRomi, pp. 135, 141 f. 48. It is quite clear that the beginning of this mashal's narrative, "a king who became angry at his son and wished (uvikesh) to kill him/' is the same stereotype as "the king who became angry at his son and killed him," and has merely been modified in this mashal because the king does not, in fact, kill his son. 49. The theme of banishment, usually from the king's palace, is a separate motif with its own tradition and diction; cf. for examples, Sifre 50b; Lev. R. 32:2; Lam. R. 3:1,1:21, and 2:1; as can be seen from these meshalim, the object of the king's wrath and whom he banishes can vary. 50. Cf. the following mashal in Seder Elijah Rabba, ed. M. Friedmann (Ish-Shalom), (Jerusalem, 1969), chap. 28, 150 f., in reference to Ps. 79:1: 1) Another interpretation of "A song of Asaph" (Ps. 79:1): But should it not be a "weeping" of Asaph, or a "lament" of Asaph, or an "elegy" of Asaph? What does the verse teach us when it says "a song of Asaph"? It teaches us that Asaph and the prophets were rejoicing over something. 2) They recited a mashal. To what is this like? It is like (mashlu mashal lemah hadavar domeh le-) 3) the daughter of poor people who went to draw water from a well, and her clay bucket broke and fell into the well. While she was crying and weeping, the king's daughter came to draw water from the well and the golden bucket broke and fell into the well. The poor daughter rejoiced and began to dance. People asked her, "Until now you were weeping and crying, and now you are rejoicing and dancing?" She replied, "Whoever will retrieve the golden bucket will also retrieve my clay bucket." 4) Similarly (kakh), when Asaph and the prophets saw that the gates of Jerusalem would be rebuilt in the future?as it is said, "Her gates are sunk into the ground" (Lam. 2:9)?they immediately began to rejoice. Asaph said, "Whoever will rebuild Jerusalem will also raise my father from the earth." While this mashal, on purely formal grounds, is not a king-mashal, it is nevertheless significant that the motif of paradoxical behavior is associated with a character who symbolizes Asaph, and that, like our Lam. R. mashal, the motif is also related in connec tion with the exegesis of Ps. 79:1: on this verse, cf. note 53 below. To be sure, the motif of paradoxical singing/weeping in this mashal has been rendered somewhat less paradoxical by making the two acts sequential rather than simultaneous, but the point of the mashal,</page><page sequence="29">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 289 as the poor girl's questioners clarify, is her paradoxical behavior. And again, her response to them is another elaboration of the theme of substitution and surrogacy. 51. Thus Midrash Psalms (ed. Buber, 360), on Ps. 79:1: 1) "A song of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance" (Ps. 79:1). Was it right for Asaph to recite a song? Should he not have recited a lament? Sim ilarly, you also find Scripture saying, "And David went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet and wept as he went up" (2 Sam. 15:30); and it is also written, "A song of David as he fled" (Ps. 3:1). This is what the verse says, "It is a joy to the just to do judgement" (Prov. 21:15): When the righteous pay for their sins, they sing to the Holy One, blessed be He. And similarly, Asaph said, "A song of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance." 2) It is like (mashal le) 3) a king who had a son who was disobedient and did not listen to his father. What did the king do? When he was filled with anger (keyvan shenitmalei beimah), he entered the bridal-chamber of his son and tore, ripped, and threw out the curtains until all of them had been torn, and he threw them out. The king said, "Did I not act wisely by destroying the bridal-chamber of my son, since I can make him a more beautiful one, and by not killing him in my anger, because if I had killed him, my nephew would have succeeded me, and it is better that my son succeed me." 4) Similarly (kakh), Asaph said, "Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, act well by pouring out His wrath upon trees and stones, and not upon His children?" 5) And so the verse says, "The Lord hath accomplished His fury, and He hath kindled a fire in Zion which hath devoured the foundations thereof" (Lam. 4:11). It is there fore written, "A song of Asaph." Both the association of Ps. 79:1 with Lam. 4:11 in this mashal, as well as most of its motifs and their sequence, are already familiar to us: 1) the king who becomes angry at his son; 2) on account of which he destroys the son's bridal-chamber; 3) and then makes a speech explaining the paradoxically beneficent side of his destructive act. For the last motif in particular, cf. the king's speech in the mashal in Mid. Ps. 90:1 (111:2). On the other hand, the diction of this mashal is considerably less stereotyped than that of the other meshalim I have discussed, especially so in its first half, and it has a number of other peculiarities as well: 1) while the mashal narrates the destruction of the bridal-chamber, there is no mention of its construction; 2) the narrative begins with the motif of the disobedient son; 3) the speech the king makes in the mashal-proper is attributed to Asaph in the nimshal, and not to God (whom the figure of the king unquestionably symbolizes). I might add in passing that the attribution of this speech to the king in the narrative appears somewhat unpleasantly self-congratulatory, if not unartful; it certainly would have been more effec tive to have a third character, like the pedagogue, make it. For the present time, these peculiarities must remain unexplained. Part of the problem with the discrepancy between the mashal-proper and the nimshal may lie in the pericope's overall attempt to assimilate the story of David and Absalom, to which 2 Sam. 15:30 and Ps. 3:1 refer, along with the paraenetic interpretation of Prov. 21:15, with the traditional exegeses of Lam. 4:11 and Ps. 79:1. In fact, the illustrand suggests a new interpretation for the significance of "a song of Asaph" which is quite different from the significance given it in our meshalim in Lam. R.: namely, that the reason why Asaph sang was because the righteous of Israel rejoiced in paying for their sins. 52. The exact identity of Asaph and the reason why paradoxical behavior is consis tently attributed to him are not clear. For differing opinions about his identity, cf. Lev. R. 17:1; L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1938), vol. 6, p. 205; M. Dahood, Psalms (Garden City, 1979), vol. 2, p. 188.</page><page sequence="30">290 DAVID STERN 53. Cf. Targum to Psalms ad locum, and on the background of the psalm, Dahood, vol. 2, p. 250. It should be added that this question is not solely a lexical one; it is also a generic question, for if it is a kinnah, a lament, what is the psalm doing in the book of Psalms? 54. Cf. Pesikta Rabbati, ed. M. Friedmann (Ish-Shalom), (Vienna, 1880), 2, p. 7a, in exposition of Ps. 30:1, and in response to the question why David was not permitted to build the Temple: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to [David]: If you build the Temple, it will exist forever and will never be destroyed ... It is revealed to Me and foreseen that [the children of Israel] are destined to sin but I will let my anger out on the Temple and they will be saved, and so it is written," ... on the tent of the daughter of Zion He poured out His wrath like fire" (Lam. 2:4). For a related theme, in regard to how the patriarchs offered to die in order to save Israel, cf. Mekhilta, Pisha 1 in connection with Exod. 32:32 etc. I wish to thank Professor B. Bokser for calling my attention to these sources. Professor A. Band has also helpfully pointed out to me that the bridal-chamber is an especially apt symbol for the Temple in light of the unusual significance given the latter in the mashal, since the beit-hupah was simply the Judaized version of the thalamos, which was a kind of wedding-bower built expressly for the marriage-ritual. 55. Such a reading of the verse makes particularly good sense because 4:11 is, in fact, the conclusion of the preceding movement in the chapter (4:1-10) which describes God's wrath against Zion; cf. Rashi on Ps. 79:1. 56. Tertullian, "An Answer to the Jews," in A. Roberts and J. Donaldson, eds., Ante Nicene Christian Library (Edinburgh, 1870), vol. 18, pp. 252-53. Cf. Justin Martyr, The Dialogue with Trypho, trans. A. L. Williams (London, 1930), 32-34; Aphrahat's famous comparison of the Temple's destruction to the ravaging of the vineyard, quoted in J. Neusner, Aphrahal and Judaism (Leiden, 1971), p. 119; Robert Goldenberg, "The Broken Axis: Rabbinic Judaism and the Fall of Jerusalem," JAAR, 45 (1977), 869-82. 57. About the prophetic character of Lamentations there is no disagreement among the Rabbis, though there is a difference of opinion as to when the book was first publicly recited. Cf. Lam. R. (Buber), 43: R. Judah says that the book was first recited (ne'emrah: possibly meaning "published"?) in the days of Yehoiakim, while R. Berachia claims that it was first written down in the days of Yehoiakim but it was not recited until after the destruction of the First Temple. 58. Lam. R. (Buber), 159-60, or Lam. 5:18. Such paradoxical behavior, it should be added, has been described in psychiatric literature as hebephrenic schizophrenia, "a chronic form of schizophrenia characterized by marked disorders in thinking, incoher ence, severe emotional disturbance, wild excitement alternating with tearfulness and depression, vivid hallucinations, and absurd, bizarre delusions which are prolific, fleeting, and frequently concerned with ideas of omnipotence, sex change, cosmic identity and rebirth" (L. E. Hinsie and R. J. Campbell, Psychiatric Dictionary [London, 1973], p. 682). Dr. Ellen Schapiro, who graciously discussed this psychological state with me, also explained that schizophrenic behavior of this kind can be instigated in persons who suffer pain so extreme they are unable to assimilate it and therefore respond with contradictory behavior; a typical example might be the case of a person who laughs hysterically while describing the death of a parent. My purpose in mentioning all this is not by any means to suggest that R. Akiva's behavior?or that of the pedagogue in the mashal?was psychotic but rather, to help us understand the power of the imaginative exegetical achievement wherein R. Akiva transformed those negative, psychotic symptoms I have described as schizophrenic into the positive and creative forms of midrash. It is this transformation that accounts, I believe, for the impression the mashal gives of something being "worked through" in the course of its narrative and exegetical movements.</page><page sequence="31">Rhetoric and Midrash: The Case of the Mashal 291 59. D. Stern, "Interpreting in Parables: The Mashal in Midrash, with Special Refer ence to Lamentations Rabba," (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1980), especially pp. 70-71, 256-59. In general, most of the rhetorical functions I identify fall under the two main categories of praise and blame, the former including such specific functions as defence, apologetics, and theological justification; the latter, polemics, condemnation, and complaint. The rhetorical function of the mashal, however, may sometimes fall under more than a single category, and the full range of functions for which the mashal is used remains as yet to be described; indeed, it is sometimes difficult to know what to call a mashal's function, as for example in the mashal in Gen. R. 10:9 (11:3), which appears to express a desire on God's part (albeit an unfulfilled one) and may perhaps imply blame rather than simple praise. 60. Cf., for example, Johnston, "Parabolic Interpretations," pp. 504-8, 529. 61. J. Heinemann, "The Proem in the Aggadic Midrashim," p. 121; cf. Mirsky, MaPitsa valan shel tsurot hapiyyut, pp. 19 ff., 26, and passim. 62. Such dating, however, must for the time being proceed with utmost caution, since studies so far have shown only that it is in the Amoraic period that these literary/rhetor ical forms reach their most completely regularized forms; nonetheless, it still appears that these literary forms best characterize those midrashic compilations we know to be Amoraic. The enumberation pattern Towner has identified is, of course, regularized in the Tannaitic period, but this form is also one of the simplest in midrashic literature. For additional remarks about other, more complicated forms, and their evolution in the Amoraic period, see the remarks of Mirsky on the pages cited in the preceding note. 63. For their generous and helpful readings of earlier drafts of this article, I wish to thank Professors Morton Bloomfield, Judah Goldin, Alan Mintz, Josef Stern, and Isadore Twersky.</page></plain_text>
