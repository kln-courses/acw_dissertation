<plain_text><page sequence="1">3. REVALUATIONS I Obviously, British interest in American studies is not something which began during the Second World War and matured rapidly after 19*+5. Yet, no doubt because of post-19^5 enthusiasm for American studies in many parts of Great Britain, such an impression has often been engendered - sometimes} indeed, unwittingly by those who ought to know better? It is partly with the object of correcting such an impression that the Bulletin hopes to publish, from time to time, revaluations of pioneering British works on American subjects. There are at least three other good reasons for attempting a series of this kinds it might help to stimulate British students of American subjects to explore the traditions within which they are working; it could draw attention to neglected but significant British writings on American themes; and it might well produce some articles which are interesting in their own right c The Editor of the Bulletin would be grateful for suggestions of books which might be included in this series; and he would welcome volunteers to revalue such works in short articles o The Bulletin is fortunate in having for its first article in this series """"study with Nottinghamshire associations . Its author teaches American literature in Nottingham University and was responsible, by his excellent organization of the 1957 B.A.A.S. Conference, for introducing many members to the D, EL Lawrence country0 The provocative character of Lawrence*s study of American literature suggests, too, that some of the most stimulating British studies on American subjects have come from writers who hail from distinct regions of the British Isles . The BuJJ^Xin welcomes any correspondence on this and subsequent "Revaluations". Do H. LAWRENCE, "STUDIES IN CLASSIC AMERICAN LITERATURE" Relatively inaccessible in this country for too long, Studies, in Class^^Ai^ has recently become 'available again in the reprint of Edmund Wilson1 s invaluable critical anthology The Shock of R?cognition. No further comment might have been needed had not the importance of Lawrence1s book been so often underestimated - and even flatly and intemperately denied - on both sides of the Atlantic as to make a fuller revaluation of it long overdue. The inclusion of it, a few years ago, in a booklist for English undergraduates reading American Studies evoked from trans atlantic correspondents comments ranging from polite surprise to the outspoken indignation of one distinguished scholar who wrote "The book is, to my mind, so outrageously lacking in either knowledge of or penetration into American literature that I canft understand why you should use it, particularly when there are so many better ones around". At almost the same time Doubleday brought it out in a 65o. paper-back edition, the jacket of which defined it as "one of the wisest books ever to have been written about the American mind" and eulogised "Lawrence's brilliant powers of prophetic moral judgment and social analysis .... in this provocative study". By shifting the emphasis from American literature to the American mind, and from'literary to social analysis, the blurb may appear to be offering some support to the animadversions just quoted, but it</page><page sequence="2">h. does not meet the objections to the book's staccato, repetitive, top-of-the-voice style and the petulantly dogmatic tone (Wilson speaks of "shots that do not hit the mark and moments that are quite hysterical1*), the sweeping, e^^afchodra judgments, and the cavalier dismissals and omissions? to ignore Mark Twain, Henry James, the Boston Brahmins and a host of lesser figures, and to reject, curtly and parenthetically, Emerson, Thoreau and Transcendentalism, suggests a critical assessment that is aberrant, esoteric, or perverse? The alert reader will remind himself, however, that this is a pioneer work, begun in 19159 revised ana published in 1923? long before the modern attention to (the unsympathetic will say ,!cult ofn) American writing 0 Moreover, it marks the first serious appraisal of American literature by a major English novelist, and the fact that, despite its academically sedate title, it is unmistakably the work of Lawrence the novelist constitutes yet another reason for a revaluation? "Never trust the artist o Trust the tale" ho warns us at the beginning, "The proper function of a critic is to save the tale from the artist who created it ? Now we know our business in these studies s saving the American tale from the American artist". The business of this study will be trying to save Lawrence's American tale from Lawrence the artist. The readers most likely to be misled by the book are those who come to it with no knowledge of Lawrence's novels or no familiarity with American literature0 In no sense a primer, it does not pretend to be a work of literary criticism in the scholarly sense. It consists of essays on Franklin, Crevecoeur, Cooper, Poe, Hawthorne, Dana, Melville, and Whitman, but Lawrence confines his attention to the aspects of these writers that are of use to him for the more lively, more dramatic, presentation of his tale (for it is a tale rather than a thesis, and it needs to be read as a wholes the inclusion of three essays from it in the Penguin selection of Lawrence's essays does not give a true picture of it). "The essential function of art is moral" he reiterates in writing of Whitman, and here, as ever, Lawrence's is a moral preoccupation. The values that he finds in American literature all correspond in some degree to those that his own novels seek to establish. When he censures Franklin, the "snuff-coloured little man" whom he admires but does not like, his eye is on the cramping, bourgeois, religious morality of the industrial Midlands that he castigated in novel after novel. Franklin's ordered list of virtuous maxims is anathema to Lawrence who accuses him of "fencing off the soul of man" and dismisses him contemptuouslys "All the qualities of a groat man, and never more than a great citizen". This note recurs when he laughs at Melville in the South Seas pining for "HOME and-MOTHER. The two things that were his damnation", and when he points out the extent to which Cooper and Crevecoeur, for all their "Nature sweet-and-pure business", are really irrevocably committed to the civilised society to which Crevecoeur regularly "trotted back in high-heeled shoes". This ruthless exposure and, at times, deliberate exaggera tion of the inconsistencies of the writers themselves is by no means as negative as it appears at first, but is wholly central to Lawrence's constructive purposo. "Never trust the artists trust tho tale", or, as ho puts it again, "An artist usually intellectualizes on top, and his dark under-censciousness goes on contradicting him beneath. This is almost laughably the case with most American artists". The artist may bo, like Crevecoeur, "an emotional liar", but his tale is not necessarily invalidated for others by this inconsistency within himself. Cooper may</page><page sequence="3">5. have been !ta correct, clockwork man .... nothing if not a gentleman", ludicrously different from the Natty Bumppo of his novels, and those novels may be as hopelessly idealised in their settings and remote from any reality as Mark Twain had already pointed out with characteristic but non-constructive exuberance. Lawrence's criticism is not as uncompromising-ly root-and-branch in its approach as it seems? he recognises The Deerslayer as being not a gem but "a bit of perfect paste. And myself, I like a bit of perfect paste in a perfect setting, so long as I am not fooled by pretense of reality." Lawrence can hardly be so "outrageously lacking in either knowledge of or penetration into American literature" when he can, in 1923, draw this distinction, then add "But it is a myth, not a realistic tale", and go on to define it as the myth of "A man who turns his back on white society. A man who keeps his moral integrity hard and intact. An isolate, almost selfless, stoic, enduring man, who lives by death, by killing, but who is pure white. This is the very intrinsic-most American.... And when this man breaks from his static isolation, and makes a new move, then look out, something will be happening". The completeness and ease with which those words could be applied to Ahab indicate which way Lawrence1s hostility to, society leads him. Not towards Transcendentalism, because from his point of view thorough-going idealists are even more out of touch with reality than the inconsistent Cooper with his wish-fulfilment themes. Emerson and Thoreau are brushed impatiently aside with the characters of The lithedale Romance as "a nice little bunch of idealists, transcendentalists, brookfarmers and disintegrated gentry. All going slightly rotten". That Lawrence should so completely ignore Thoreau is at first surprising, especially when he has praised in Crevecoeur an observation of nature that many would claim is bettered in Waiden, but a comparison of Crevecoeur1s description of humming-birds fighting (which Lawrence quotes) with Thoreau1s battle of the ants will justify Lawrence's claim for Crevecoeur? "Insects, snakes and birds he glimpses in their own mystery, their own pristine being". The parabolic anthropomorphism of Thoreau's description is too consciously didactic to satisfy Lawrence as arts he himself can - and does - offer just such an interpretation of Crevecoeur's swallows and wrens as "a parable of the American resurrection", but this is in his critical roles the artist ought not to be his own interpreter. Thornton Wilder, in a lecture on Thoreau reprinted in The Atlantic Monthly, 1952, sees him as "disconnected from place, distrustful of authority, thrown back upon himself" and praises the "powerful clarifications" that came from his "embattled individualism". But the hinted Lawrentian parallel here breaks down as we read on. Important as the ideas of loneli ness, individualism and isolation are to Americans, to American literature, and to the understanding of both, and well-as Lawrence writes on this theme, they can be and often are sentimentalised by Americans, a s I think they are by Wilder when he writes "our interest in Thoreau is precisely that we see one of ourselves fighting, struggling and finally fainting in this inescapable American situation". Laurence condemns in Whitman this desire to identify himself emotionally with the sufferings of others, this sentimentalising and "merging", and the susceptibility of Waiden to this process on the part of its readers may partially explain Lawrence's ignoring it. Moreover, after making his experiment at Waiden, Thoreau returned to Concord, admittedly to preach the duty of civil disobedience, but nevertheless to rejoin society. That</page><page sequence="4">6. Lawrence would find this indistinguishable from Crevecoeur's trotting back to France, that he does not draw between the two men the distinctions that many other writers would, is perhaps regrettable, perhaps myopic. The case for Thoreau is admirably put in Norman Holmes Pearson's introduction to Waiden, especially in this passages "Thoreau did not deify the individual as an isolated being, antagonistic toward other individuals. The true system of the world would come in the inevitable co-operation of men who, by their concern for essentials and by their respect for each other, moved in accord with a common understanding of the highest law". The existence of such a law Lawrence would question and even deny, but his denial of it is not without value even to those who disagree with him; and in one sense his rejection of Thoreau is a tribute to the complete consistency of Thoreau's position, since presumably Lawrence finds in the book no inner contra diction to "redeem" it. Even in his isolation Thoreau believes in and belongs to humanity, unlike the other American of whom Lawrence writes? "Melville has the strange, uncanny magic of sea-creatures, and some of their repulsiveness. He isn't quite a land animal. There is something slithery about him. Something always half-seas-over.... Melville is like a Viking going homo to the sea, encumbered with age and memories, and a sort of accomplished despair, almost madness. For he cannot accept humanity. He can't belong to humanity. Cannot." Isolation as treated by Melville and Hawthorne is important to Lawrence because it is not sentimentalised or idealised, and is very firmly rooted in an awareness of the essential imper fectibility of man that Lawrence is willing to accept even though he has reservations about the Puritan conception of original sin from which it stems. He is indeed very much less than fair to Hawthorne when he complains of a duplicity which is the fatal flaw in American works of art "and most fatal in the most perfect American work of art. The Scarlet Letter. Tight mental allegiance given to a morality which the passional self repudiates". Lawrence is so anxious morally to condemn this duplicity that he pays insufficient attention to the fact that The Scarlet Letter is about that very conflicts Dimmesdale represents"the "tight mental allegiance", Hester the "passional self", and the tension between these two principles is the basis of the whole novel. Lawrence's view of Hawthorne does not make the important distinction that F. 0. Matthiessen was to formulates "Not sin, but its consequence for human lives is Hawthorne's main theme". This charge of "duplicity" arises from Lawrence's insistence on an aspect of human nature that transcendental idealism seems to him to ignores "Nowadays men do hate the idea of dualism. It's no good, dual we are.... We are divided against ourselves.... You canft get away from this. Blood-consciousness overwhelms, obliterates and annuls mind consciousness. Mind-consciousness extinguishes blood-consciousness, and consumos the blood. We are all of us conscious in both ways. And the two ways are antagonistic in us. They will always remain so."</page><page sequence="5">7. The main reason for his antipathy to Thoreau, I suspect, could be identified in Thoreau's definition of his own aims "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach". Thoroau the pupil in the school of life would provoke from Lawrence the indignant sneer that Crevecoeur aroused? "He wants to 'know' . TO KNOW. Oh, insatiable American curiosity!" Lawrence would want Thoreau to live "passionally" not "deliberately", to intellectualize loss, and to rely more on blood-knowledge. As we might expect, Lawrence's mind-consciousness is often less reliable in this book than his intuitive awareness. When he urges us to read The Deerslayer "as a lovely myth" he has anticipated the thesis of Henry Na.sh Smith's Virgin Land, although naturally he does not analyse the wider implications of this as Mr. Smith does nor does he draw the same conclusions frcra it. The reasons he gives for the first migrations to New England will seem over-simplified to the historian, while his disregard of political, economic and at times even geographical factors will seem irresponsible to others. His distrust of intellectualization will more than once appear to be pushed almost to absurdity; it differs in kind from, and is more honourable in motivation than, much of the prevalent "anti intellectualism" in the U.S., but the comparison and contrast that it constantly prompts will throw useful light on both. Moreover, in Lawrence it is counter-balanced by an almost equally intense and thoroughly salutary distrust of the primarily emotional response, as in this comment on Whitmans "I AM HE THAT ACHES WITH AMOROUS LOVE. Walter, leave off. You are not HE. You are just a. limited Walter? And your ache doesn't include all Amorous Love, by any means. If you ache you only ache with a small bit of amorous love, and there's so much more stays outside the cover of your ache, that you might be a bit milder about it." This is one of the book's great values, the way in which it sets up dualities, antitheses of this "mind-knowledge" and "blood-knowledge" type, and, despite the illusory air of fanatical extremism that its style suggests, tries conscien tiously to see these as complementary. Thus, although he can exult in the fact that "The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer", he can, over the page, produce this generalisations "The central law of all organic lifo is that each organism is intrinsically isolate and single in itself. The moment its isolation breaks down, and there comes an actual mixing and confusion, death sets in. But the secondary law of all organic life is that each organism only lives through contact with other matter, assimilation, and contact with other life, which means assimilation of new vibrations, non-material. Each individual organism is vivified by intimate contact with fellow organisms s up to a certain point." To appreciate the relevance of this to American literature it is necessary only to have remarked in Moby Dick the significance to the isolate Ishmael of the monkey-rope and the spern squeezing, or to have read Robert Frost's "The Tuft of Flowers" or any novel by Hemingway. The isolation of the individual Lawrence sees as making for a new, vital American literature, the sense of community as something of a drag on it, and so we have yet another antithesis s</page><page sequence="6">8. "The rhythm of American art-activity is dual, 1? A disintegrating and sloughing of the old consciousness. 2o The forming of a new consciousness underneath." To the sloughing process in American writers he is warmly sympathetic. . The extent of his admiration for Franklin is the extent of Franklin1s desire to rebel against the old European consciousness ? "..e. ho hatod England, he hated Europe, he hated the whole corpus of the European being. He wanted to be Americano But you canTt change your nature and mode of consciousness like changing your shoes. It is a gradual shedding . Years must go, and centuries must elapse before you have finished." Lawrence could understand, intellectually, that "It is a long and half-secret process" and yet he could not contain the impatience of his "blood-knowledge" that Franklin was not changing his shoes quickly enough, had, indeed, only untied one of the laces. Franklin's maxims and middle-class morality have contributed to the insistence on conformity that has mado America, for Lawrence, "The land of THOU SHALT NOT". In this denunciation ("This the land of the free I Why, if I say anything that displeases them, the free nob will lynch me, and that's my freedom", and "In the Land of the Free, the greatest delight of every man is in getting the better of the other man") Lawrence perhaps goes too far, but it is based on a very shrewd perceptions "It is never freedom till you find something you really positively want to be. And peoplo in America have always been shouting about the things they are not". More than thirty years after Lawrence wrote that, it is still much easier to define an un-American activity than an American one. Beneath his shrill indignation lies the awareness that the concept of liberty has betrayed America only when it has been idealised and sentimentalised to the point where any other notion of liberty is attacked as heresy, where conformity is adopted in self-defence, and where the old principle of indivi dualism and the isolation of the individual are submerged in a society aptly defined as a lonely crowd. David Riesman's social picture loads him to non-Lawrentian conclusions, but it seems to fulfil some of Lawrence's less hopeful prognostications of the American future. Similarly, some of Lawrence's incidental comments on racial and colour questions are almost an anticipation of Faulkner's in their recognition of the impossibility of an accelerated or artificial solution by legalistic or humanitarian reform. When he condemns as bogus Whitman's feeling for the slave and the prostitute (true sympathy being a feeling with, not a sentimental merging s "the soul judging for herself and preserving her own integrity") he draws a distinction that still has its message for the idealist "do-gooder". If these things illustrate Lawrence's "brilliant powers of prophetic moral judgment and social analysis" what has preceded them may show his importance to the student of American literature who does not take him as his first or only guide. "It is a significant circumstance of American culture", writes Lionol Trilling, "that an unusually large proportion of its notable writers of the nineteenth century were such repositories of the dialectic of their times - they contained both the yes and the no of their culture, and by that token they were prophetic of the future." It is a merit of this book that it perceived that dialectic and stated it in terms which, even though the corpus of subsequent criticism has modified and added to them, remain lively, witty, challenging and provocative to the reader who has the knowledge and the acuteness to read them, as they were intended to be read, as imaginative rather than literal truth.
