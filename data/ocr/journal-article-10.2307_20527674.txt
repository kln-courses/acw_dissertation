Oxford, New York: Blackwell Publishing, 2006. ?50.00 (cloth), ?19.99 (paper) The Day of the Dead, the Mexican elaboration of the feasts of All Saints and All Souls, is one of the best-known festivals in world ethnography. Endlessly discussed in the Mexican media, pondered in navel-gazing studies of Mexicanidad, drafted into popular nation-building mythology, and packaged for tourist promotion, the Day of the Dead has, for Mexicans and foreigners alike, become emblematic of Mexico. In Octavio Paz's hugely influential The labyrinth of solitude (1950) it became a key to the Mexican character, even the Mexican soul. A reappraisal was overdue, and this short but comprehensive book by Stanley Brandes does an effective job of d?mystification. Written in pleasing non-academic prose, free of footnotes and jargon, and illustrated with fine photographs, Skulls to the living is now the best available introduction to the topic, bringing solid anthropological research to bear on a cluttered and contradictory literature. Brandes begins - as one must these days - with a personal anecdote: his own discomfort at being asked, as a fledgeling researcher, to photograph a corpse at a funeral. (Did his reticence and their openness show something different, he wondered, about Mexicans' relation to the dead?) A long-term ethnographer of Tzintzuntzan in the central state of Michoac?n, he found himself increasingly dismayed at the overwhelming tourist presence during Day of the Dead celebrations, the TV crews trampling over cemetery offerings, and the general loss of authenticity. He was, he confesses, a 'modernist anthropologist confronted by a post-modern world'. But the Day of the Dead could no longer be understood apart from these intrusions - mass tourism, national media coverage, and globalization turned out to have critical roles in the reshaping of the holiday. This became Brandes's central concern. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 15,172-218 ?

First, he is against those commentators who postulate a timeless Mexican culture - and specifically, a preoccupation with mortality, a cult of death - that persists through pre-Columbian, colonial, and modern formations. In this ahistorical cultural approach, the sugar skulls and anthropomorphic bread sold as altar offerings and gifts on the Day of the Dead are akin to the stone skulls on Aztec monuments: survivals, or elements of the same cultural essence. Against the culturalists, Brandes asks: why\s sweetness associated with death, and why is the complex of grave-vigils, domestic altars, and food symbolism found only in Mexico, given that All Souls is a canonical Catholic holiday celebrated throughout the Hispanic world? He finds the answers in a combination of political economy and history. The conquered Indians of New Spain, an oppressed, remnant population, were much possessed by death. Put to work on sugar plantations, their products were marketed, transformed, and consumed locally 'in an area of intense religious concentration and activity, where ritual and belief were critical instruments of social and economic control' (p. 39). The Day of the Dead is best understood as the Mexican version of a Catholic holiday that developed in response to the specific historical and economic circumstances of colonization. It is neither a simple importation of Spanish custom nor an echo of pre-Conquest eschatology. To clinch the argument, Brandes makes comparisons with medieval Spanish practices, and between the different circumstances of Spain's other New World colonies. It would be interesting to know - Brandes does not explore the issue - how the variation in intensity with which the Day of the Dead is celebrated in contemporary Mexico maps onto the chequered histories and economies of its regions. One of the virtues of this book is the careful analysis of material culture. Brandes shows how commentators have generalized a standard Mexican attitude to death from the ephemeral productions of the Day of the Dead. In the received view, the cult of death gave rise to the humorously morbid Mexican - another of Brandes's targets. But the grisly icons of the festival - the grinning sugar skulls and capering skeletons, the satirical mock-epitaphs and newspaper broadsides called calaveras (skulls) - have little to do with ordinary grieving. Funerals are solemn occasions marked by displays of powerful emotion that run counter to the national stereotype of casual indifference in the face of death. Brandes concludes, 'No special Mexican view of death, no uniquely morbid Mexican national character, has produced this mortuary art' (p. 66). The second half of the book considers the role of tourism in the expansion of Day of the Dead celebrations over the past quarter-century. From being a small-scale graveside vigil with a minor community aspect, the festival in Tzintzuntzan is now a major commercial event attended by thousands of tourists. A family fiesta has become a large-scale enterprise. The changing content of the event - intensive commercialization, an emphasis on performance and the display of local crafts, the 'symbolic conversion of the town cemetery into a stage set' (p. 87) - reflects this packaging of local identity and its outward projection. As Brandes shows, the involvement of state agencies in the marketing and reinventing of local tradition has been a crucial factor in its transformation. Surprisingly, he makes little of the differences between the perspectives of domestic and foreign tourists, and he barely touches on what they make of things. Instruments of globalization and change, they are passive and anonymous. Against the efforts of purists and cultural nationalists, globalization again rears its ugly head in the form of the witches and spooks of Halloween that have infiltrated the Mexican holiday from across the northern border. Brandes suggests that 'the Day of the Dead has come to symbolize Mexican identity and autonomy, while Halloween, at least as perceived by Mexicans, has become representative of the United States and its imperialistic designs' (p. 117). This proposition (sensibly qualified by Brandes) is belied by the evidence of the last part of the book, which concerns Day of the Dead celebrations, imitations, and samplings in the United States. Increasingly adopted in schools as part of a multicultural curriculum, the festival has been transformed into a secular or ecumenical community event - 'therapy' for uptight Anglos wanting a more relaxed encounter with mortality. Among poor Ch?canos - California's fruitpickers and undocumented labourers - the Day of the Dead has become a celebration of ethnic pride amidst economic disadvantage. Brandes's approach throughout is doggedly factual, even forensic, mostly sceptical of generalizations. He carefully weighs rival interpretations but eschews theoretical discussion. Unlike Hugo Nutini's study of the same event (Todos Santos in rural Tlaxcala, 1988), there is no discussion of the forms of syncretism. Nor does he consider the relevance of different Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 15,172-218 ?

(Gerd Baumann's useful idea that, in complex societies, 'ritual implicates others' springs to mind.) Perhaps these restrictions were imposed by the generalist format of the book. For all that, Skulls for the living deserves a respectable afterlife. It is a cogent, attractively presented case study of a single festival in its diverse forms. It provides a lucid account of cultural change and a careful plotting of causes and influences. I still revere The labyrinth of solitude, but will read it henceforth with a more critical eye.
