<plain_text><page sequence="1">James Joyce's Bloom 39 James Joyce's Bloom: The Mongrel Imagery James Joyce once wrote a "tactically masochistic" letter to his Nora in which the image of an abused mongrel fig ures predominately: "... I have wandered like a mongrel dog that has received a lash across the eyes ... wandered about the streets like some filthy cur whose mistress had cut him with her whip and hunted him from her door."1 Joyce's novelistic art reflects much of the same maso chistic propensity. It is evident in the mongrel imagery and its concomitant symbolism in Ulysses, particularly with refer ence to Leopold Bloom. The psychic significance of the mongrel image to Joyce's Ulysses is manifested early in the novel as Stephen Dedalus, in the "Proteus" episode, watches the dog Tatters loping along Sandymount strand as his owner calls to him: "Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel. The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk back in a curve" {U 46-47).2 The kick is brutal; the dog's cowardice is reflected in the intransitives "sulk" and "slink." "Flight" instead of "fright" is also appropriate in this context. Although the dog is not physically harmed, the animal fears potential harm from his master. Physical brutality is connected with the masochistically tinged image of the mongrel Garryowen in U 295: The anonymous narrator of the "Cyclops" episode recalls complaints about "that.. . mangy mongrel" Garryowen: ". . . bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him that would 1 Mark Shechner: Joyce in Niglitown: A Psychoanalytical Inquiry into Ulysses (Ber keley: University of California Press, 1974) p. 84.

Rea give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if some one would take the life of that bloody dog" (U 295). Later, the bibulous citizen himself took the "bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and near throttled him ..." (U 295). Corporal beating, throttling, and kicks thus relate to the mongrel image in Ulysses. The canine tries to retaliate in U 299: ". . . . Bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs." The dog's growls are stifled by more violent blows from the sadistic citizen. In "Circe," in his role as transvestite, Leopold Bloom receives threats of physical abuse that will be as painful as the kick Garryowen got in the ribs: Bloom hears from Bello that he "... will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets . . . with whale bone busks ... to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outer edge . . ." (U 535). There are fetishistic components in that fantasy. Rank regards fetishism, as Freud did before him, as ". . . partial repression with compensatory substitute formations. . . genitals are [symbolically] replaced by a pleasure invested part of the body . . . corsets, etc."3 Moreover, an individual who is excited by the notion of being constricted exhibits masochistic signs: ". . . in masochism it is a question of con version of the pains caused by parturition (phantasy of be ing beaten) into pleasurable sensations . . . explained by the typical element of masochistic phantasies—for instance the almost regularly occurring state of being bound ... as a partial reinstatement of the intrauterine pleasurable condi tion of immobility. .. ."4 Bloom's fantasizing fulfills two deep unconscious needs: to be bound (fetishism) and to be beaten (masochism), which relate to the pleasurable intra uterine condition (immobility-being bound) and the trau matic birth experience (pain-being beaten). Three women characters, Mrs. Talboys, Mrs. Belling ham, and Mrs. Yelverton Barry, who appear in the trial 3 Otto Rank: The Trauma of Birth (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1929), p. 34. 4 Rank, p. 34. Rank maintains that the custom of swaddling or binding the baby in swaddling clothes imitates the pleasant state of intrauterine motionlessness (p. 35). Joyce alludes to the swaddling custom in U 537 when Bello warns Bloom against urinating and soiling his undergarments: "If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha!"</page><page sequence="3">James Joyce's Bloom 41 scenes of "Circe" with Bloom, suggest some "corrective" sadomasochism to Bloom, to chastise him for being a cuck hold, or rather, for allowing his wife to cuckhold him. Mrs. Mervyn Talboys, "in a sudden paroxysm of sud den fury," in U 467, exclaims that Bloom is a dog, and will treat him as such: "I'll scourge the pigeon-livered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive"; Bloom's reactions are those of a mongrel cur receiving or anticipat ing blows from his mistress or master; he "... quails expec tantly . . . squirms . . . pants cringing," and confesses "I love the danger" (U 467). Freud observed that in the fantasies of masochists "... the manifest content is of being ... painfully beaten, whipped,... forced into unconditional obedience .. ."5 "Make him smart, Hannah dear," Mrs. Bellingham tells Mrs. Talboys: "Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat o' nine tails. Geld him. Vivisect him" (U 468). "The aristocratic amazons threaten to thrash, geld, and vivisect their prey."6 Threatened with a fearful form of killing, castration, Bloom reacts accordingly: "(Shud dering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien) O cold. O shivery!" (U 468). The "hangdog mien" that Bloom evinces in the above scene may only appear to be a display of subservience. The threats of corporal punishment are enforced by suggestions of stinging whips and whippings by words like "smart" and "ginger." As Fenichel states: "Plea sure aroused by painful stimuli of the skin is the erogenous basis of all types of masochism . . . The existence of eroge nous masochism is ascribable to the fact that, like all sensa tions in human organism, the sensation of pain, too, may be a source of sexual excitement."7 In U 469, Bloom is again threatened with beatings, osten 5 Freud, St. Ed. 19, p. 162. bSuzette A.

Rea sibly like a dog: "Pig dog . .. ever since he was pupped! ... I'll flog ... him," says Mrs. Talboys. Elsewhere, Bloom undergoes a dual degradation: dressed like a woman, he is being treated like an animal lower than woman, a dog: Marilyn French states: "For Bloom being fe male means experiencing sex as surrender and violation, be ing treated as . . . mere body- a non person . . . and beast."8 The portrait of Bloom as a dog who must be beaten because of misbehavior is analogous to that of the classic masochistic subject, who ironically, is subject and object at the same time. Furthermore, in Brivic's formulation, male ".. . masochists construct fantasies or arrange situations of being beaten by women to avoid the idea of homosexually succumbing to the father . . . Joyce sees through this in the 'Circe' episode . . . when he transforms Bella to Bello . . ."9 Freud stated that "the . . . wish, which so frequently appears in phantasies, to be beaten by the father stands very close to the other wish, to have a passive (feminine) sexual relation to him and is only a regressive distortion of it."10 In its implications for Bloom, the image of the large mongrel dog takes on anthropomorphic connotations: The dog image conveys brutality on the animal and human lev els, such as the brutality Bloom experiences directly in Barney Kiernan's pub, where he is psychically abused and debased by the citizen and his cohorts. The ill treated mongrel Bloom degenerates into in "Circe" is foreshadowed by the appearance of maltreated "Tatters" in the "Proteus" episode, and in "Cyclops," by the "bloody mongrel" Garryowen, who like Bloom, is a scape goat for collective sadism, particularly at the hands of the nameless citizen. Throughout Ulysses, Bloom experiences and fantasizes about suffering. Bloom exhibits traits of what Freud calls "moral masochism," in which ". . . the suffering itself is "Marilyn French: The World as Book: James Joyce's Ulysses (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1976), p. 198. 9Sheldon R.
