<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. GOODALL COMMENTS ON DR. S. WATANABE'S PAPER * The question of the relation between a physical and a mental language suggests as an analogy the complementarity of identity and interaction. By a very gross analogy you can imagine the investigation of identity is a physical type of investigation, and the investigation of interaction is a mental one. Now this is a very gross analogy, but it's not too bad. Now the next point - the reason I think it's only approximate (and this is obvious) - is that one can offer something which might be better. If you think of this dualism in another way, it's a dualism of two modes of thought being pushed to the limit - the limit being when you get into problems of self-reference. Now Dr. Watanabe mentioned the problems of self-reference in physics: namely, that when you're discussing an elemen tary particle you have to do it in terms of something still more elementary. A similar situation is present in mental phenomena, which I prefer to call 'cognitive systems' because that gets away from any anthropomorphism. A cognitive system is something you can imagine has the properties of being intelligent. Now you cannot define, deterministically at any rate, an intelligent machine, because if you do so you get into a contradiction. For if it can be defined, then it has a strategy. But the essential char acteristic of intelligence is that it learns to improve its strategy, so it must have a strategy which works on the strategy, and so on. This is a typical problem of self-reference. So one has two extreme theories where you get involved in the problems of self-reference. Now in the case of quantum mechanics, its known that a modular lattice is not good enough to describe quantum mechanics. It's good enough to describe one-particle theory but not several interacting particles that are created and annihilated, or even, really, in the one-particle case where you have emission and absorption of radiation. This was known to Von Neumann and Birkhoff. But what is the appropriate logic for quantum * S.

GOODALL mechanics, is not yet known. There are various guesses. One possibility is semimodular, and another possibility is a skew lattice where there is a non commuting combination of elements. Is there a possibility of a more general approach? I claim that there is. The central idea is to start from the point of view of how does one deal with the problems of self-reference. This is a problem which came up in logic at the beginning of the century, and Russell and Whitehead offered the theory of logical types to handle it. The theory of logical types has gone through a number of developments ; none of them is really quite satisfactory. But what they all imply is an appeal to a many-valued logic. You can see that if you've got a paradoxical state - one which can be neither true nor false - there must be some other value than true or false, and if you look at the attempts to offer some substitute for the theory of types you get things which are weakenings of two-valued logic. They are attempts to open up the system to the generation of types; that is, the introduction of rules about rules which will make the system more solvable. Now you can see what the limitation is in the modular form of logic. It's known that if you try and make a representation of complementary operators or variables in quantum mechanics, the range of values cannot both have the same cardinal number. If one is countable the other must be uncountable, and this means that they are different logical types. So it's a theory with just two logical types. And it seems from the example of second quantum theory that this isn't good enough. For already the state occupa tion operators have an uncountable range while that of the complementary phase operators is clearly not countable.
