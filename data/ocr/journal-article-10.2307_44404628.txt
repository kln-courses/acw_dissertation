<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUBSTANCE AND SPIRIT Of Architectural Photography THROUGH THE FACTS TO WHICH CAMERA WORK IS LIMITED, SOMEHOW SPIRIT Alfred Stieglitz might have strung the above words together in that very order some- time during his talks with people about the essence of picture-making photography. Since the "quote" concerns the essence of camera work, it must also apply to architectural pho- tography. To see how we need only ask "what spirit?" and answer, "the animus of the building, the street, the city"; or, from a sufficient body of photographs, "the life of architecture". Spirit or essence is not caught on hooks, nor netted like butterflies; not trapped like mice and bears, nor is it copied, nor imitated ; nor is it hypodermically injected as photog- raphers wistfully hope. Greater preparations than any of these are necessary : perhaps only through a constantly growing personal stature on the part of the architectural photog- rapher may essence be reached. These pages are pointed at growth, aimed at the everyday business of preparing mind and feelings for photographing architecture rather than tech- niques which are amply covered elsewhere as are the warnings to make sure a ladder is in good repair before climbing. Resemblance reproduces the formal as- pects of objects, but neglects their spirit ; truth shows the spirit and the substance in like perfection . He who tries to trans- mit the spirit by means of the formal aspect and ends by merely obtaining the outward appearance, will produce a dead thing .

BRUNO ZEVI Too many photographers turn to architectural photography, either occasionally or pro- fessionally, with no more than a nest-building instinct to guide them. While we yield to this instinct its due respect, we, the audience of the architectural photographer, have a right to expect more, especially from the professional. We can expect that his pictures stem from study: that he knows why historian Sigfried Giedion can say that "Architecture has a life of its own" ; why Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius can write "Modern Architecture is not a few branches from an old tree - it is new growth coming right from the roots" ; we can expect that he recognizes the academicism Frank Lloyd Wright scolds when he writes "Time was when architecture was genuine construction, its effects noble because true to causes". Above is the intellectual side of the architectural photographer's preparation. On the emotional or feeling side we can expect that his pictures originate in a heightened ability to stand still in a room, hall, porch, walk quietly in a garden, street or courtyard and feel the breathless breathing of architecture. Or, in our present, ride just fast enough over a cloverleaf interchange to feel space-time through the seat of his pants. We should expect and even demand that his pictures help us sense the heart-beat which an architect, or com- munity of cathedral builders, gave to stone, wood, glass, steel because he has felt that pulse in his own veins. We have every right to ask these ideals because just as there is good and bad architecture - good when it ennobles, bad when it degrades - so do we have good and bad architec- tural photography and for the same reasons and the same effects. Pertaining to ethics: should an architectural photographer make an ennobling photo- graph of an example of degrading architecture? Assuming that he had the inner stature to photograph a piece of jukebox architecture so that the photograph was an affirmation of ascending spirit, can he afford the lie ? Each must make his own decision. We are more or less aware that recently the history of architecture is influenced in a dozen subtle ways by what can be photographed ; yet it seems desirable to discuss the sub- ject with more of an eye on the responsibilities of the architectural photographer to his contemporaries, to architecture, to history, to good and evil. 145</page><page sequence="4">MORLEY BAER Navy School, Monterey, California Architects: Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill 146</page><page sequence="5">On the Intellectual Side The architectural photographer should learn to approach his mystique of interpretation with a lively interchange between intellectual knowledge and a craftsmanship of feeling. The intellectual side is mainly conceptual, expressible in words and usually indirect. Knowing where a given example fits in history, or in the economics, or the technical fea- tures will help slant the photography ; whereas the feeling side is direct, wordless, a way of evoking the insight needed on the spot to reach essence. The more experience he has the better he knows how and when to bring his intellect into play and how and when to let his feelings take over. Architecture is a social art . It becomes an instrument of human fate because it not only caters to requirement but also shapes and conditions our responses . . . . It modifies and often breaks earlier es- tablished habit . RICHARD NEUTRA Good architecture should be a projection of life itself and that implies an intimate knowledge of biological , technical and artistic problems . But then - even that is not enough . To make order out of all these different branches of human ac- tivity . . . WALTER GROPIUS To maintain that internal space is the es- sence of architecture does not mean that the value of an architectural work rests entirely on its spatial values . Every build- ing can be recognized by a plurality of values: economic , social, technical, func- tional, spatial and decorative . The real- ity of a work of art, however, is the sum of all these factors ; and a valid history cannot omit any of them.

LEWIS MUMFORD</page><page sequence="14">On the Feeling Side Once early in his career the architectural photographer must "live" with a great build- ing: bridge, skyscraper, park or other until the essence of it has seeped into him. And changed his life! With the unforgettable experience of even a great barn - these rural cathedrals that are occasionally seen - he will always know what to wait for when he starts to photograph a building new to him. The photograph on the opposite page seems to originate in a heightened feeling for architecture. Englishman Fredrick Evans at the turn of the century had a reputation for achieving a remarkable state of harmonious affinity with the cathedrals that he sought out in Britain and the Continent. Something of this rapport enlivens his photographs. Such a reputation is downright important to the dependent spectator who has never seen, say, Kelmscot Manor and so can not compare his feeling aroused by the photograph with that evoked by the attic. When a photographer has earned a reputation for insight and for honestly knowing when the feeling aroused by his photograph is equivalent to that aroused by the original, the spectator is free to accept the feeling evoked in him by the photograph as true to es- sence - so far as that is humanly possible. When a photographer has earned a reputation for a more personal approach to architecture his pictures are valuable for other reasons. According to art historian Bernard Berenson honest photographs by men of perception and taste are certain to give the spectator viewpoints to which by his own temperament he is blind. Architectural historians are often avid consumers of all photographs, good and bad alike, of architecture of the stature of a Notre Dame or a Massachusetts Turnpike because a wealth of opinions temper their own. What photographer is so universal that he can hear all the echoes of a Chartres or an Empire State Building ? Today's professional architectural photographer has the responsibility of achieving a reputation, a reputation for a feeling for architecture. Is there any reason why his reputa- tion should not be equal to that which Fredrick Evans earned in his lifetime ? And beyond a feeling for architecture he should know how to make the feeling evoked in the spectator (not in himself) by the photograph be equivalent to (not equal to) what the spectator would have experienced in the original. This part of his camera work is not expressive, not insight, not art, but a hardy craftsmanship of feeling. Chartres became one of the outstanding experiences of a lifetime . . š . The ap- proach to the town , with the cathedral seen towering over it from its elevation - the increasing detail upon drawing near with an ever increasing emotional response - arrival at the portal - then the moment of entering - a sense of peace - the brief illusion that by accepting the religion that brought it into being this sense of union could be perpetrated - the realization that this was a moment not to be made captive . Out into the sunshine again - walking and looking : but no photographs. Some- thing of the ego of the artist must be restored before the illusion of equality could be re-established, and work could become possible. CHARLES SHEELER</page><page sequence="15">FREDRICK EVANS Kelmscot Manor- Attic about 1895 Courtesy George Eastman House It should not be assumed that a pho- tographer - or a critic ! - can grasp in five or ten minutes what took the sculp- tor or architect months or years to create. HELMUT GERNSHEIM 157</page><page sequence="16">. ē . A building is not merely a sight; it is an experience ! And one who knows architecture only by photographs does not know it at all . LEWIS MUMFORD CONFLICT Even though photographs cannot substi- tute for the actual experience of archi- tecture certain advantages lie within pho- tography's limitations. In its ability to record only a small segment of the total impression is the advantage of abbreviat- ing to the point of clarity - in pointing out and intensifying the essentials of any impression. NORMAN CARVER , JRĒ ASSUMING THAT MUMFORD IS RIGHT, THEN THE ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHER GOES TO WORK WITH FAILURE IN HIS CAMERA. HIS STRENGTH LIES IN THE BELIEF THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF A PHOTOGRAPH CAN BE THE ECHO OF AN EXPERIENCE OF A BUILDING HE THRIVES BECAUSE HE NEVER UNDERESTIMATES THE VALUE OF AN ECHO! According to Frank Lloyd Wright architecture is not bounded by four dimensions but more, many more: Alfred Stieglitz claimed that camera work is dimensionless. When camera work is employed to record architecture, however, the dimensions are sharply reduced. Time is their common denominator. Three dimensional space is an illusion in photography - though Baroque buildings exploit the same illusion. Light, as Le Corbusier says, is the loudspeaker of architecture. Common denominator though time seems, though they share the present, time is not identical for photography and architecture. 158</page><page sequence="17">SPACE &amp; TIME ARE OF THE ESSENCE OF ARCHITECTURE. TO ECHO ARCHITECTURE THE PHOTOGRAPHER USES A MEDIUM WHOSE ESSENCE IS TIME &amp; LIGHT On one hand the present is the exact instant, never to be repeated : for example the long shadow at precisely 7:19 A.M. March 19 which magically reveals the essence of a building in such a way that the camera can see it. But morning and March come again, and again ; and the building may change so little meanwhile that to our gross senses the exact moment of revelation repeats. On the other hand the present is also longer periods ; the revealing moment endures in some instances for hours on every grey day and night after night. Under these conditions a fraction of a second is the same length of time as an hour and camera work experiences time as buildings do. Observe last year's photograph of a building now bombed out and another dimension is experienced : one is aware of the life of buildings and then of the separate life of their photographs. Time is the least comprehensible, the most elastic of all the curious qualities of photog- raphy - this medium at once commonplace and sur-realistic, familiar and esoteric. TO INTERPRET OR TO RECORD Though some writers on the subject take definite sides, to interpret or to record is not at all like living between the devil and the deep blue: the best architectural photography is always something of both. Author after author says in one way or another that the ideal architectural photograph is a record of an interpretation of facts. Yet some favor factual reporting and others interpretation and stake their claims. We feel that both have a defi- nite and logical place: one is more appropriate to geometrical architecture, the other to asymmetrical architecture - if we may make such sweeping generalizations. We propose to follow in the footsteps of Heinrich Wölfflin, German art historian who developed a set of concepts for analyzing modes of vision in the arts and architecture. We propose a range or scale of balance between interpretation and record. On one side the balance shifts in favor of interpretation, on the other the shift is in favor of record. The six photographs which follow illustrate the scale including the excesses of what can be included in the definition "the architectural photograph is a record of an interpretation of facts". As we shall see the interpretative mode carried too far becomes exploitation of subject matter, and conversely the record mode carried too far becomes witless. While the terms are not fully descriptive, we will call one side of the scale "inter- pretative" and the other "making facts speak for themselves". As any architectural pho- tographer will agree, making facts speak for themselves is a highly interpretative act ! The creative energy necessary to interpret is exactly the same as required to make facts speak for themselves. 159</page><page sequence="18">MINOR WHITE Cobble Stone House, upper New York A SCALE OF MODES: The Interpretive Mode (Romantkistic, organic) ' Starting with the interpretative side of the balance, the above photograph seems to be an obvious example of interpretation that exceeds the bounds of architectural photog- raphy. The information given about the cobble stone house in upper New York state is incidental to the statement that a house has relations, normally invisible, to land and sea- sons. Some persons may argue, however, that showing such relations, because rarely seen, is no cause for excluding the photograph from the class. The boundaries of architectural photography will remain hazy. Coburn's photogravure of St. Paul's in London is on the borderline between exploita- tion and interpretation. Again the spectator can decide for himself whether this is more Coburn than Cathedral, or, only a little more Coburn than the evocation of the very living spirit of Christopher Wren's church.</page><page sequence="19">ALVIN LANGDON COBURN St. Paul's, London about 1920 Architect: Sir Christopher Wren Courtesy George Eastman House Like architecture its photographs may be considered from more than one viewpoint. These two photographs also illustrate the style of two photographers working about fifty years apart. Both are romantics, Coburn in a style prevalent at the beginning of the 20th Century and White in the manner of the mid-century straight photographers. Something of the period affects photographers as well as architects; hence the spectator of photo- graphs must learn to make allowances. The influence of period is one more veil that must be pushed aside to see the architecture.</page><page sequence="20">NORMAN CARVER, JR. Detail in garden, Japan The detail by Norman Carver, Jr. is rendered factually enough, yet out of context as here may seem exploitation of subject matter. In its place in a book on Japanese Architec- ture it crystallizes many pictures and symbolizes the feeling that photographer and archi- tect Carver has towards one of the most integrated traditions of architecture in the world. In another direction this symbol reflects his convictions about modern architecture, "the need to find in architecture those abstractions that approach the essence. ..." 162</page><page sequence="21">CHODŹKI EWI EZ Fontainebleau, France about 1855 Courtesy George Eastman House Chodzkiewiez in his long series on Fontainebleau achieves an almost even balance be- tween interpretation and letting facts speak for themselves. For those spectators willing to project themselves into the photograph the spirit lies just beneath the surface. But relate the pictures on these two pages ! Half a world apart in space, five decades in time, two cultures, yet thought of together and some kinship is felt that goes far deeper than similarities of a few shapes. 163</page><page sequence="22">THE THINGS-SPEAK-FOR-THEMSELVES MODE (Classicistic, geometrical) AARON SISKIND Monastery section, Alcoman Church, Mexico On the side of the scale called "facts speak for themselves" the photographer makes a great effort to be the thinnest possible ghost between the spectator and the architecture. Observe the qualities: substance almost everywhere, the light gives form to the build- ings instead of changing form, the formal position of the camera is impelling - the frontal position frequently promotes the feeling of integrity that comes from looking at things for what they are. This position is appropriate to the Round House, arresting in the monastery wall. Both of these pictures are comfortably within the limits of architectural photography. Beyond this, which is not illustrated, stands the witless record. The document fails when things can not speak for themselves because they are gagged by a lack of perception. 164</page><page sequence="23">Unknown photographer about 1875 Round House at Nevers, France Courtesy George Eastman House 165</page><page sequence="24">Throughout history there persists two distinct trends - the one towards the ra- tional and geometrical; the other towards the irrational and the organic: two dif- ferent ways of dealing with or of master- ing the environment. SIGFRIED GIEDION In the quotation above Giedion also follows Wölfflin. And since they divide mankind as a whole into two temperaments, architectural photographers can probably be included as well as the builders and architects. The two trends have several opposite qualities : in- tellectual as opposed to emotional ; a regard for things as they are as opposed to a fascina- tion for things as they are seen in relation to each other and to environment - or as Wölfflin says "things in the process of becoming". There are more opposites. The photog- raphers such as Coburn and Evans favor interpretation and so belong to the organic trend ; photographers such as Chodzkiewiez or Nickels belong to the geometrical trend. As Aaron Siskind says the latter group practice "an aesthetic restraint, which is after all basic to all documentary photography." The temperamental différences are deep and rarely to be crossed. For example the very assets of the organic temperament, his "romanticism", is hurled back at him as an epithet by members of the opposite camp: and he, not slow at adding insult, declares that the desire of the rational minded photographer to say out of the picture, to let things speak for themselves is evidence of a lack of insight. Spectators also belong to one trend rather than the other and, as might be anticipated, this has a bearing on how they respond to architecture, to architectural photographs and to vision. And here like is sympathetic to like. The organically oriented spectator is un- comfortable when viewing photographs unless they show a positive interpretative bias and will call dead pictures which the geometrically oriented spectator finds a gate to spirit. The "rational" spectator welcomes the opportunity to read the facts for himself and relishes the assurances that if he brings his own insight to act he will reaach the essence of the sample photographed. The temperamental differences are just as deep here as in the pho- tographers - the "rational" kind often resents and rejects off-hand photographs which show a veil of personality. Romanticistic Classfcistic The baroque neutralizes line as bound- ary, it multiplies edges, and while the form in itself grows intricate and the order more involved, it becomes increas- ingly difficult for the individual parts to assert their validity as plastic values ; a ( purely visual ) movement is set going over the sum of the forms, independently of the particular viewpoint. T he wall vi- brates, the space quivers in every corner. Classic taste works throughout with clear- cut, tangible boundaries ; every surface has a definite edge, every solid speaks as a perfectly tangible form ; there is noth- ing there that could not be perfectly ap- prehended as a body. HEINRICH WÖLFFLIN 166</page><page sequence="25">The spectator is rarely as involved as the photographer and so with some training can be brought to an awareness of his own temperamental direction and later to enjoy photo- graphs made in the mode to which he is not naturally sympathetic. The professional pho- tographer, on the other hand, has to learn to expand his natural leanings because he must photograph an organic glass block one day, a Greek revival house the next and poured concrete Gothic later on. He has to learn to cross over at will from the great class of what Wölfflin names "classicistic" architecture to its opposite "romanticistic" (Baroque, organic modern, etc.) If the photographer is able to reveal with assurance the essence of the mode of building to which he is sympathetic, as a professional he must be able to evoke the spirit of the other mode with equal competence. To do this he must learn a craftsmanship of feeling by which he can expand his own temperament as far as possible. Our appreciation is conditioned by the photographer's interpretation much in same way as intelligent enjoyment of music is dependent on the interpretive powers of soloist or conductor . HELMUT GERNSHEIM In the ideal case, recording accuracy is blended with sensitive interpretation of the meaning of a three dimensional work of art and with the creation of an inde- pendent work of two dimensional design, NIKOLAUS PEVSNER Our photographs are based on an objec- tive study of meaning of the architecture - at least four specialists explained to us at one time or another the important aspects of Sullivan's work: we heard opinions and examined other architec- tural photographs - not on private pref- erence. ... an esthetic of restraint came out of this group work, which is after all, basic to all documentary photography. AARON SISKIND Sculptor Pevsner in the quotation above champions the classicistic mode. Photographs which are independent units in their own right, in a general way, are appropriate to the architecture which stems from the same mode. This ideal, however, with which Pevsner would blanket all of architectural photography is not appropriate to architecture that or- ganically grows from the site, or architecture that embodies the idea that Louis Sullivan found in Asa Gray's botany "Seeds are the final product of the flower, to which all its parts and offices are subservient". Another kind of photograph is appropriate: those which are less independent, more fragmentary, those which reach out beyond the picture frame for suggestions and for space. Especially the contemporary organic architect and his idea of space-time: space-time is best echoed with two or more fragmentary photographs that lock into a whole in the mind of the spectator.

And does it make a good, an esthetically good, pattern in form and tone? These questions will he answered much more confidently than the other: Is the photographer's a legitimate pres- entation of the architect's or sculptor's intentions? NIKOLAUS PEVSNER CONFLICT When an architect looks at his building he sees the myth in his mind instead. In this situation the photographer who thinks himself an artist cannot cope as well as one who is clairvoyant. ARTHUR SIEGEL ARCHITECTURE AS AN ORGANISM Ruskin's discovery in the last century that stones have tongues and building life was one upheaval among many which marked a revival of projecting, by introspective means, the human being into the inanimate. Freud's introduction of the objective scientific method to romantic introspection was another undulation of this underlying current of anthropo- morphism which makes itself felt in many fields today, organic architecture not the least. For example our determination to identify buildings or city planning with individual architects : compared to the cathedral builders who anonymously raised stones to the glory of God our own collective efforts are crystallized in the architect. "You mean there is a good piece of archi- tecture for me to look at?" Noê I mean, here is a man for you to look at ... I mean that stone and mortar here spring into life and are no more material and solid things . . . wholesomeness is there, the breath of life is there, and elemental urge is there. LOUIS SULLIVAN Never fear. We are all poets. You do not see things now; but, a little later on, things will begin to see you and beckon to you; and you will understand. So, when I tell you that this wretchedly tormented structure, this alleged railway-station, this alleged terminal railway- station, is in the public-be-damned-style, is degen- erate and corrupt, I repeat to you only what the building says to meģ LOUIS SULLIVAN 170</page><page sequence="29">Our architects in turn speak of buildings as being alive ; the metaphor that a building is born, lives and dies seems natural to us. The architectural historian projecting pastward thinks he can discern the opening, crescendo and decline of groups of buildings or cities and speaks of "periods", cultures. When we project human qualities into stone and steel and time architecture indeed seems to be an organism with a historical continuity. The architectural photographers - the fifth generation of them are at work today - have an ambiguous, because shifting, relation to architecture as organism. This is so partly be- cause the objectivity of camera work hides a central indeterminacy and partly because time pertaining to buildings passes differently than time perceived by man. As the life of a cat is to a man, so a man to a building: to a cat a man must always seem to be the same age. Charles Sheeler, painter and photographer, bullseyes the situation when he writes, "Even though I have so profound an admiration for the beauty of Chartres, I realize that it be- longs to a culture, a tradition, a people of which I am not a part. I revere this supreme expression without having derived from the source which brought it into being." Fredrick Evans, a period or two closer to Chartres than Sheeler, appears in his pictures to agree that for all his rapport he can not return to the source. If this is true a Gasparini can photograph a chapel by Le Corbusier with greater insight than he could a Gothic cathedral because the chapel was "invented" in his own lifetime. Or a Szarkowski can photograph the idea of Louis Sullivan because of the sympathy of a young man for a young architecture, though he never met the man and the buildings are rapidly disap- pearing. ANTHROPOMORPHISM: SUSPICIOUS TO MANY IS CATALYST TO ARTISTS, ARCHITECTS INCLUDED. HENCE THE ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHER MUST UNDERSTAND ITS USE-AND USE. Centuries old is the practice to let fall into ruin those buildings that we have ceased to understand š' today we bomb them into basements for taller buildings or bulldoze them into parking lots. The relation of the architectural photographer to architecture as an organism is also affected by the spirit of the times or period. Fredrick Evans, for all his insight and per- ception of the significance of the ancient cathedrals, may have to admit that he is bound to see with the same eyes that his contemporaries use. Compare the photographs repre- sentative of the style of seeing prevalent a century ago, Frith, Du Campe, the unknown master of the Round House with the contemporaries, Siskind, Carver, Baer. The difference seen is due in part to the influence of the times or period ; part of the difference is ascrib- able to how a period looks at its heritage. The first generation of photographers recorded the great buildings of Europe with respect and sufficient familiarity to be conscious of feel- ing. The contemporary generation of photographers records buildings known to be built to last only twenty years. An amazing and organic interchange has happened between pho- tography and architecture in five generations : the great buildings first recorded were made for men not photographs ; today architecture is camera conscious and often new buildings and their sites look as if lifted from the pages of the architectural record. 171</page><page sequence="30">JOHN SZARKOWSKI Carson Pirie Scott Store, Chicago Architect: Louis Sullivan Thus do I insidiously prepare the way for the notion that creative architecture is in essence a dramatic art , and an art of eloquence : of subtle rhythmic beauty, power, and tenderness.

Its subtitle "How to Look at Archi- tecture" gives an inkling of the approach which is contemporary, readable, comprehensive, tailored to the serious task of orienting the layman to his visual environment. Author Bruno Zevi is an architect, critic and editor of an architectural journal in Italy, his history of architecture is widely used in Europe and South America. He is aware of photography and its effect on architecture: he may well share with Andre Malraux (voices of silence) the belief that the history of art and architecture is a history of what can be photographed. On the problem of photographic interpretation of architecture Chapter V is pertinent. The chapter contains a description and discussion of the merits and defects of the various ways which architecture has been interpreted over the centuries. These are literary to be true, but the whole spectrum of interpretations is represented from romanticism which borders on sentimentality to classicism which borders on sterility. The parallels in the way photography has interpreted architecture are easy to discover. And nowhere else are the various ways as ably or compactly presented. The inclusion of a critical discussion of the many books on architecture is especially helpful to the photographer exploring the field for the first time. 2 SPACE, TIME AND ARCHITECTURE Sigfried Giedion Harvard Press, Third Edition, 1956 space, time and architecture is a resounding exploration of the subject as it appears to a 20th Century man. The old architecture is described, sources included and the growth of the new and modern architecture is unfolded. Earlier in the contemporary idea of or- ganic architecture than Zevi, Giedion was one of those who helped formulate the idea of Space-Time. As a student of art historian Heinrich Wölfflin the latter's principles and concepts of art history underlie the book. Comprehensive, astute, lively, the book pertains to the living nature of architecture and by this token to living itself. 180</page><page sequence="39">3 ARCHITECTURE OF TRUTH Lucían Hervé and François Cali George Braziller, New York# 1957 The centuries old Cistercian Abby of Le Thoronnet in Provence, France was photo- graphed by Lucian Hervé.

The collaboration is architecture of truth, an evocation of the feeling, mood, spirit of a building that is still what it always was and always will be as long as one stone stands on another. 4 PRINCIPLES OF ART HISTORY Heinrich Wölfflin Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1932 The principles of art history first appeared in German in 1915 and has gone through many editions since. And Wölfflin's influence continues to spread in many fields of art and architecture, especially the critical branches. The photographer in need of a way of seeing architecture as a whole in order to under- stand and present an individual example can hardly find a better tool than the five con- cepts that Heinrich Wölfflin proposes. The concepts are paired; Linearly &amp; Painterly Plane &amp; Recession, Closed &amp; Open Form, Multiplicity &amp; Unity, Clearness &amp; Unclearness and stand in some opposition to each other. The left hand members of each pair pertain to the great classicistic mode of human activity, the right hand members point to the romanticistic mode. Wölfflin divides human activity into these two great classes and claims that history shows mankind swinging like a pendulum between the two. Little more than an inkling was given in the Scale of Modes (pp. 160-165) of a way of using a romanticistic style of photography to record romanticistic architecture and the opposite. THE principles of art history fully explains the approach, though the pho- tographer will have to learn to apply the principles on his own, because little or no men- tion is made of photography in the book. 5 KINDERGARDEN CHATS Louis Sullivan Scarab Fraternity Press, 1934 kindergarten chats serves architecture as six lessons in acting serves the theatre: the care and feeding of creative talent. No book exists in photography that is concerned with the care and feeding, the training of creative photographers, so look elsewhere. In this book Sullivan plays the role of teacher to a young architectural student who has fin- ished his formal training. He is a wise teacher because he lets the student make his own discoveries: the discoveries of spirit which mature a man while keeping him young. 181</page><page sequence="40">6 FOCUS ON ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE Helmut Gernsheim Fountain Press, London, 1949 Gernsheim is astute in pointing out that the approach required for photographing architecture is similar to that required for sculpture: the use of a two dimensional medium to copy three dimensional media forces the photographer to interpret. Of the mere handful of books on the subject, the best is focus on architecture and sculpture ; practical, down to earth, full of handy advice, yet concerned with the prob- lems of interpretation which are the occupational disease of architectural photography. His main thesis is that architecture must be well understood to be well photographed. This is amply illustrated with his own photographs of the great buildings and their sculpture during the bombing of London. Why Gernsheim considers his thesis original with himself is a little hard to understand especially in the face of the work of such men as Roger Fenton and Fredrick Evans which he discusses in a short history of architectural photography. From the evidence of their handsome photographs they also understood architecture and must have loved the build- ings that they phptographed. (Out of print.)
