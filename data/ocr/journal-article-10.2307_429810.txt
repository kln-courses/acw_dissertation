<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAROL DONNELL-KOTROZO Representation and Expression. A False Antinomy THE METHODOLOGY of art history does not include a theoretical examination of tradi- tional issues and problems. This has largely been the function of philosophical aesthe- tics. Such a neglect of theory is especially perplexing considering the radical shifts in the conventional perspectives of art history that are likely to occur. A case in point is Morris Weitz's illuminating discussion of mannerism.1 A further example is provided by post-impressionism which poses problems for both the art historian and the aestheti- cian who might be concerned with the rela- tionship of representation to expression in art. While the philosopher seeks general prin- ciples to govern the usage of these terms, the empirically-minded art historian focuses on the particulars of various historical situ- ations. Thus, the post-impressionists offer a specific case of the larger issue of repre- sentation versus expression in the sense that there is no uniform interpretation of Cezanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin. Art his- torians have equivocated for decades as to the correct placement of this problematic late nineteenth-century movement. Do they fall within the boundaries of realism and naturalism as representational styles, or do they align with the subjective expressionists of the twentieth century? The lack of a firm foothold for this group of artists is still of persistent concern to art historians. To avoid a fatal fall into the CAROL DONNELL-KOTROZO is associate professor of Humanities at Arizona State University clutches of nineteenth-century representa- tional styles, they have generally preferred a more forward-looking interpretation of the post-impressionists in keeping with their concepts of evolutionary progress in style, a progress that seems mysteriously to propel its way through history, yet with a clarity and a logic befitting an order-seeking dis- cipline. The standard historical view of post- impressionism as proto-expressionism is fraught with insuperable difficulties, many of which stem from errors of omission. Be- cause the discipline of art history is intract- ably negligent in acknowledging the posi- tion of aestheticians on the issues of repre- sentation versus expression, it is still per- petuating outmoded concepts reflective of the dualistic language of the nineteenth century. Christine McCorkel has noted the general distrust of all theorizing common to art history after World War I.2 In the United States, this anti-philosophical mood parallels the logical empiricists' repudiation of meta- physics and denotes an attempt to restrict art historical inquiry to "objective" con- siderations of concrete evidence. The theo- retical poverty of art history reflects the as- sumption that theoretical "speculation" is irrelevant to the creation of a factual world of perfect order. It is ironic that in its search for a refinement of methods for defining and dealing with historical facts, art historians have ignored the efforts of aestheticians to investigate and clarify the usage of such terms as representation and expression. The</page><page sequence="2">D ONNELL-KOTROZO inconsistency and imprecision with which these terms are utilized in an art historical context is indicative of a lack of understand- ing of the nature of aesthetics and its alleg- edly uniempirical a priori system building. For example, H. W. Janson in "The Art Historian's Comments" contrasts the histori- cal methodology of his discipline with the generalized theoretical approach of aesthet- ics and concludes that "the values of art his- torians may be molded by contemporary ar- tistic production but not, so far as I am aware, by aesthetics."3 A look at the history of the term, repre- sentation, and associated concepts such as realism, impressionism, and naturalism as they are applied to post-impressionism should reveal the erroneous assumptions and groundless dualism that have been per- petuated by contemporary art historical criticism. The example of the post-impres- sionists will also serve as a paradigm case of the exigency of adopting a theoretical solution to an art historical dilemma. I pro- pose to counter the complaint of art histo- rians that aesthetic theories, though logic- ally defensible, have not been tested against the works themselves as a measure of their theoretical validity. Contrary to the scep- ticism of art historians, the issues of aesthe- tics are genuinely of mutual concern. The prevailing view of post-impressionism as a boundary-breaking revolutionary art movement stems from the artists' common rejection of impressionism and naturalism, two diverse styles that shared the belief that one's knowledge of the world was limited to those aspects of reality that the observer experienced empirically. Although the artists of the post-impressionist movement were grappling with the relation between the natural and the practical worlds and felt there to be an intimate connection between art and nature, it was not in terms of the strict model-copy relationship of scientific naturalism. With naturalism and impres- sionism, art had come to adopt the scientific method as the artist concentrated on repro- ducing tie world as if neutrally observed, relinquislhing subjective and emotional con- notations. This conception of neutral or objection vision is a testimony to the influ- ence of the positivistic philosophy of the mid-nineteenth century. Although it is likely that artists and theorists alike misconstrued some aspects of the new philosophy, their assumptions have been held by art historians to the present day. Baudelaire, in his "Salon of 1859," con- trasts two kinds of truth sought by two divergent kinds of art: The immense class of artists . . . can be divided into two quite distinct camps: one type, who calls himself "realiste" . . . and whom we, in order to characterize better his error, shall call "positiviste," says: "I want to represent things as they are." And the other type, "l'imaginatif," says: "I wtant to illuminate things with my spirit and project their reflection upon other spirits." 4 Certainly this is an oversimplification of the theory of positivism in which Baudelaire distinguishes the truth of a mechanical realism (associated with the photograph) from that of a human, subjective encounter with nature. However, this divorce of the "absolute truth" of external reality and the fantasies of the imagination is found in other later critics of the period such as Eugene Fromentin, Roger Marx, Armand Silvestre, and Theodore Duret. (A sampling of twentieth-century art historians reveals similar attitudes: John Rewald, Linda Nochlin, and H. R. Rookmaaker among others.) The artists who came to be known as im- pressionists modified this positivistic doc- trine, somewhat changing the emphasis in painting from the naturalist's photographic imitation of reality as an expression of mechanistic materialism to an analysis of what they believed to be retinal perception in its multiple variations, particularly in terms of the light effects found in nature. The impressionist painter continued to accept the basic presumptions of naturalism; but attempting to rely upon the raw data of visual experience, his intention was to record visual impressions as exactly seen and to capture with accuracy and immediacy what was considered to be the optic experience of reality. The representation of nature changed but was still equated with a stan- dard of objective accuracy, a norm of true perception. 164</page><page sequence="3">A False Antinomy Impressionism, however, carried the seeds of disintegration within its own theories, as many painters within the movement came to see that the depiction on canvas was more than the simple recording of pure "inno- cent" visual sensations of the perceptual surface of the world. Despite the popular view that the passage from impressionism to symbolism and post-impressionism was a radical and traumatic event, it was consis- tent with contemporary developments in physiological psychology which was already beginning to break down the positivistic distinction between subject and object through an emphasis upon the experience of the observer and by the assertion that the so-called facts of reality were not absolute.5 Art, like normal visual perception, came to be seen as a process of organizing sensory elements into some degree of meaningful formal patterning. This new awareness of perception as pat- terning, and of the formal elements of art as an integral part of the artist's representation of his visual impressions of reality is the hallmark of the post-impressionist revolu- tion. The term, post-impressionism, was coined by Roger Fry to describe the shift from the representational art of impres- sionism (based upon an imitation of some aspect of natural appearances) to a new tradition based upon a more subjective analysis of reality and upon intentional acts of expression. Fry declared the movement "the greatest revolution in art that had taken place since Graeco-Roman Impres- sionism became converted into Byzantine formalism," a remark reflective of his hyper- metropic attitude toward subject matter in painting (which he felt must invariably compromise formal considerations.)6 The term, post-impressionism, is accurate insofar as it is descriptive and has the addi- tional benefit of being emotively neutral. Fry's alternative term for these artists who came chronologically after impressionism, expressionists, has proved to be more con- troversial in that it suggests a value-laden interpretation that is in accord with the dualistic position of the mid-century posi- tivists in which objectivity and subjectivity are irreconcilable. Post-impressionism be- 165 comes the subjective antithesis of the natu- ralist's or impressionist's objectivity. (Clive Bell, identified with the same aesthetic creed as Fry, loathed the impressionists' "scientific pretentions" as being the ultimate degrada- tion of imitative art.)7 Because the natu- ralists and impressionists represented the standard of photographic accuracy in paint- ing at this time, it was believed that the post-impressionists could offer only a dis- torted representation of reality by compari- son. Partly, then, as a result of the positivistic theories of late nineteenth-century critics and theorists, and partly because of Bell's and Fry's emphatic formalism which eschewed all interest in representation, the post-impressionists were credited with a radical emancipation of the artist from the entire tradition of representational art which previously sought to capture if not rival nature in paint. Fry was greatly mistaken to believe that artists such as the post-impressionists were consciously altering their natural vision of "objective" reality to express "subjective" emotions. Although he is correct in assuming that art should not be judged by its scien- tific accuracy in rendering undigested sense- data, he falls into error when he implies that any deviation from scientific naturalism involves intentional distortion or subjective expressionism. For example: Van Gogh's pictures are not the least like our pictures. Their origin is different . . . Vincent's paintings are pure self-expressions . . . His vision of nature is distorted into a reflection of ... inner condition.8 Systematic attempts to reconcile or explain the old dichotomy of representation versus expression appear in various guises in twentieth-century asthetics. Before exam- ining some of the representative theories, it is relevant to undertake a brief excursion into some further semantic problems in- volved in a discussion of post-impressionism. The Fallacy of Naturalism An old and problematic preoccupation of aesthetics has been the relationship of art to "life." At one time, representation had</page><page sequence="4">DONNELL-KOTROZO been defined by the imitation theory ac- cording to which art is understood as the "faithful, literal duplication of the objects and events of ordinary experience."9 The art object was associated with the cognitive and descriptive elements of the visible world and its value was derived primarily from the degree of verisimilitude it displayed in rela- tion to the object imitated. The nineteenth- century concept of naturalism is derivative of the older imitation theory. The term has met with several objections concerning its narrow application and its limitations as a norm of descriptive accuracy in art.10 There is a great deal of confusion and misinterpretation of the concept, not only in regard to philosophic naturalism, but in regard to its relationship to similar terms suffering also from widespread misuse (such as realism and representation). Real- ism refers more properly to visual forms derived from the direct experience of the actual in everyday life as exemplified by the art of Courbet, Millet, or Daumier. Naturalism as used by art historians usually refers to an uncritical or seemingly unemo- tional manner in which the forms of reality are rendered, as though to convey mere factual information (as in the military paint- ings of Detaille, the fastidious detail of Meissonier, the trompe-l'oeil illusionism of Peale or Harnet, or the more contemporary photographic images of Close-Focus Realists like Richard Estes or Chuck Close). The acceptance of naturalism as a norm for representational accuracy in art forces one to draw the distinction between an art which is descriptive of reality and an art which expresses personal feelings or attitudes toward nature.1' When many critics and artists began to react to the positivistic interpretation of nature in the late nineteenth century that was felt to reduce the creative possibilities of art to a slavish imitation, the term natu- ralism took on derogatory associations implying the inhibition of artistic freedom. It was felt that the new currents in art such as post-impressionism and symbolism valued more the "inner" nature of reality rather than its surface appearance apprehended passively through the senses. Thus, those who rejected naturalism nevertheless failed to understand that an artist need not be naturalistic in order to represent reality according to valid (albeit not merely "objec- tive") perceptions. Rather, they upheld the dualistic proposition that the language of objective reality is naturalistic, that truth is scientific and value-free, and that there is an unbridgeable ontological dichotomy be- tween the subjective and the objective, be- tween values and facts. When mechanical vision is regarded as the "objective" com- ponent of perception (of pure sense-data) and is separated from the "subjective" or interpretative component, it implies the acceptance of a materialistic reality and denies the possibility of a representational reality suffused with expressive value. As a result, the concept of distortion is required in order to explain formal adjustments of "normal" vision and its transposition into the medium of paint on a two-dimensional plane. Any liberties taken with "factual" and "objective" reality appear as deviations from what was now considered to be the most accurate mode of representation of nature possible (even if that mode was des- pised and rejected). Thus, on the basis of such a theory, it was assumed that an artist who did not comply with the scientific mode of transposing apparently had other "sub- jective" or "expressive" aims in mind. Such assumptions and such a narrow con- ception of naturalism as a standard of repre- sentation in art gave rise to an aesthetic theory that failed entirely to take into account the basic aims of post-impression- ism whose fundamental representational interests became obscured by the prevailing dualistic distinction between representation and expression. Nevertheless, terms such as expressionism, symbolism, and synthetism, arose as alternative theories to justify the post-impressionists' aversion to a positivistic reality and to account for what was taken as "the flight into what is subjective and de- tached from the outer world." 12 Synthetism is closely associated with the name of Emile Bernard, who sought to simplify form and color for the sake of more forceful expression in painting. He advo- cated a kind of simplified handwriting by 166</page><page sequence="5">A False Antinomy which he endeavored to capture the sym- bolism inherent in nature. The role of the imagination was paramount in attaining the new aesthetic sensibility. The works of the post-impressionists, and most particularly Gauguin and the School of Pont-Aven, seemed to embody the new independence of nature in line with Bernard's ideas on the simplification of modes of expression. Other artists and critics, in correspond- ence with the contemporary movement in literature, preferred to use the term sym- bolism although there are basic similarities between the two concepts. Its strongest nine- teenth-century proponents were Maurice Denis and Albert Aurier. The symbolists regarded internalized experience as pro- viding an escape from the materialistic cul- ture that surrounded them, and they wished to embody that experience in art. Their con- centration upon the expression of emotion generated from within led them to criticize impressionist art and to deride it as materi- alistic because of its apparent preoccupation with the pure impression, the sensory response to the external environment. The post-impressionist's association with sym- bolism may stem from this common rejec- tion of impressionism, however exaggerated the separation may have become between these various contemporary and in many ways interlocking movements. The idea of distortion became a self-con- scious means of artistic expression for the symbolists: The 'distorted'-or, as we would be more in- clined to say today, 'abstracted'-formal elements of line, color, shape and so on become the means of converting the particular sensation or emotion into a concretely manifest 'idea' (to use Aurier's term), a realized image of generalized meaning.'3 Representation and Expression in Modern Aesthetic Theory The legacy of the nineteenth century has been a rather restrictive view of the nature of representation and a linguistic distinction between representation and expression that should more properly be seen as a separation of function between naturalistic depiction and expression, the extremes of a continu- um. To equate naturalism with the concept 167 of representation is to risk ambiguity and semantic imprecision. Although many art historians persist in collapsing the boundaries between natu- ralism and the broader category of repre- sentation in their discussions of nineteenth- century art, there have been various attempts in aesthetics to integrate repre- sentation with theories of expression. When representation is associated with traditional imitation theories emphasizing "illusion" or verisimilitude to an objective reality and when expression is linked with a retreat into subjective emotionalism or ego-projection, such a dualistic polarity does not readily admit of any logical fusion. However, despite philosophical differences the theories of Langer, Arnheim, and Gombrich share a common concern with modified definitions of representation and expression which allow for an integrated framework that best de- scribes the situation of a majority of styles in the history of art including the transi- tional movement of post-impressionism. A glance at several more contemporary theo- rists will provide an indication of future directions for resolving the problem sur- rounding the logical usage of these terms. While the nineteenth century accepted a positivistic conception of nature, it was also in the nineteenth century that critical re- search into the intimate constitution of matter and the exploration of the human mind by psychological experiment resulted in the proposition that the so-called facts of reality were not absolute. Psychological theorists such as imile Littr6, Theodale Ribot, and Hippolyte Taine, as well as others (such as the "psychophysicists" Gustav Fechner and Caries Henry), concluded that the observed nature of external "objective" phenomena is a product of human con- sciousness and depended upon the method of observation of the perceiving subject. The application of related ideas to art has been the contribution of E. H. Gom- brich whose Art and Illusion14 draws inspir- ation from the radical reorientation of all traditional ideas about the human mind brought about by modern psychology. The "sense-data" theory of perception w hich posits a mind in which sense-data are de-</page><page sequence="6">DONNELL-KOTROZO posited and processed is deflated and re- placed with a more relativistic conception of perception in which the active contribu- tions of the mind (synthesizing, organizing, selecting, integrating) obviate the possibility of passive reception of sense impressions from reality. Perception depends upon the basic structure of the mind and upon past knowledge and expectations based upon known experiences. Works of art are also dependent upon these factors. Thus, if there is no pure vision of reality (the "innocent eye" theory), the theories of the impressionists are invalid in purporting to capture the true nature of visual experience. If all seeing is inter- preting, there is no neutral naturalism, no direct artistic revelation of what we see unmediated by any perceptual judgment. There have been subsequent critical assessments of Gombrich's views centering upon his faulty equation of representation and illusion. Gombrich also suffers from lapses of logical consistency when he seems to treat Constable as a norm of representa- tion in art and speaks of "matching" reality as a possible form of "making" it. Nelson Goodman offers a contemporary reappraisal of representation as denotation which is independent of any requisite resemblance to reality. Goodman accepts and clarifies Gombrich's sound contention that the his- tory of styles in art is the product of a sys- tem of classification, of characterizing objects according to conventional systems that are standard for a given culture or person at a given time (Gombrich's "schema"). Thus, realism or naturalism is not a matter of any constant or absolute relationship between the system of representation employed in a picture and the standard system. The fact that the traditional system is taken as stan- dard probably accounts in my view for the erroneous assumptions about post-impres- sionism when measured against such a stan- dard in the mid-nineteenth century. Goodman's statement "a picture looks like nature often means only that it looks the way nature is usually painted," 15 could be reversed to elucidate the problem of post- impressionism in which a novel, unconven- tional style was not accepted as a perspective on nature simply because this was not the way that nature was customarily portrayed. Gombrich, in tandem with Goodman, thus offers a concept of representation that allows for the unique vision of the post- impressionists who are nevertheless the anti- thesis of naturalism. Whether or not the artist intended to depict the appearance of nature is not always relevant.l6 If reality cannot be perceived in its actuality, and if there are countless alternative systems of representation and description, then there is insufficient reason to believe that an artist cannot depict reality with flattened space, simplified form and color, or distinguished by emphatic outlines or geometric fragmen- tation. Whether intentional or not, the post-impressionists' depiction of reality in these terms has become as valid and as con- vincing a manner today as the naturalistic mode no doubt had been to the positivist. It is simply a question of acquiring famil- iarity with new relationships between forms and space as the prerequisite for accepting new art styles as genuine perspectives on nature. (In essence, life imitates art.) The issue of intentional distortion must be re- examined in this new context, not as a deviation from naturalism, but as the neces- sary process of transformation that reality inevitably undergoes in order to be repro- duced in any given medium and as the consequence of diverse culturally condi- tioned standards of representational accu- racy. (Goodman states that an innovating representation "may bring out neglected likenesses and differences, force unaccus- tomed associations, and in some measure remake our world.")17 If all art involves subjective interpretation because of the fundamental nature of per- ception as well as the demands of a medium,'8 it remains to clarify the rela- tionship of representation to expression. Can expression, in the light of the evidence remain distinct from representation? Is there a logical dissimilarity betw een correspon- dences to nature on the one hand, an1d tlhe deliberate reassembling of artistic elements in the interests of expression on the other? 168</page><page sequence="7">A False Antinomy A critical analysis of the appropriate appli- cation of terms such as expression or expres- sionism in propositions about post-impres- sionism will reveal that no such radical dissimilarity exists. Traditionally in art history, expression is taken to be the logical antithesis of repre- sentation in that a predominant intention to embody personal feelings in material form is felt to compromise the intention to depict a visual experience of reality. The art historical term, expressionism, was in- vented to emphasize the contrast between an art which was based on purely visual impressions (e.g., impressionism) and a new movement which sought, instead, the inten- tional expression of ideas and emotions. (This could be achieved by the exploitation of visible subjects to accentuate their sym- bolic or emotive character.) Because of the apparent personal nature of post-impres- sionism, many critics found such a theory applicable to their art. This distinction is unacceptable and re- flects, as with the concept of naturalism, a presupposed dichotomy between the sub- jective and the objective components of experience. Furthermore, it suggests an un- comfortable fusion of expression and emo- tional catharsis. An examination of the issue compels the assertion that the post- impressionists' dislike of the literal render- ing of objects practiced by the naturalists and impressionists, does not necessarily imply an anti-representational intention on their part or an interest in emotive effusion. Even if the artists themselves should have misconstrued the nature of representation it would still not entail an accurate desig- nation of these artists as expressionists by contemporary standards. The traditional expression theory in aesthetics reenforces this error and, if it is to be upheld at all, is perhaps better suited to describe the situation following the post- impressionists such as the German expres- sionists or the abstract expressionists who sought the deliberate and intentional crea- tion of works which embody or objectify feeling. Whereas the post-impressionist artist might also seek such embodiment in the 169 forms and images of reality, the avowed expressionist completely negates an adher- ence to external perception and retreats consciously into a subjective dimension deemed more "real." Thus, if a work of art can no longer be conventionally (publicly) accepted, according to conceptual and per- ceptual habit as a possible perspective on reality, it is not a representation. The criticism of the expression theory centers around the locus of anthropomor- phic qualities projected into works of art, i.e., whether emotive qualities can be trace- able to features of the medium, the subject matter, or "in virtue of what an artist does in a work." 19 Such criticism also concerns the contention that uses of anthropomorphic predicates are metaphorical,20 and can be discerned by attending to the work in ques- tion even when it presupposes something about the artist. The shift of attention from a preoccupation with the artist (in theorists like Veron, Ducasse, and Collingwood) to a concentration upon the work itself is an attempt to free the older theory from the misassumption that a necessary link exists between the qualities of a work and certain mental states of an artist. (It is interesting that such a problematic correlation is re- established by Guy Sircello who states that although expressive properties may be as- cribed to works of art, they cannot be de- tected by attention to the work itself.) Advocates of the expression theory, how- ever, perpetuated a necessary but illogical split on the level of analysis between emo- tional expression as a product of projection or intentional acts and the work which pre- sents it, despite the fact that on the level of experience a work does not display such a division. How then can a reconciliation be attained between incompatible attitudes toward the same work of art? The expres- sion theory will not stand up against the fact that "subjective" phenomena do not always exist independently of an "objective" context. Thus, just as it is true that the perception of reality is the product of a human perspec- tive which includes one's subjective nature as well as culturally conditioned values, and</page><page sequence="8">DONNEL -KOTROZO that expression as a consequence cannot be divorced from the work of art which is based on that reality, so it is true that the embodi- ment of reality in a work of art must neces- sarily become something other than a literal equivalent or a mere corollary to a prior "act" of perception or expression. Attempts to redefine expression in terms of formal embodiment in a work itself can be seen in the theories of Susanne Langer and Rudolf Arnheim. According to Susanne Langer art is ba- sically an illusion or semblance in the sense that it abstracts from the multiple perceiv- able qualities in reality and must translate this abstraction into terms permitted by a medium.21 As such it becomes a metaphor- ical image which she calls "presentational symbolism." We might discard here the debatable theory that art is a product of the intuition whose purpose is to "set forth directly what feeling is like" because her conception of feeling as "living form" is too generalized, and it is speculative as to whether or not the cognitive value of art lies solely in the exposition and elucidation of the nature of feeling. We might, however, consider the validity of her designation of art as "expressive form," as "a visible, in- dividual form produced by the interaction of colours, lines, surfaces, lights and sha- dows, or whatever entered into a specific work." 22 This helps to clarify why repre- sentational art can be so variable in appear- ance (as with naturalism arnd post-impres- sionism.) The elements of a work are not independent constituents, each individually expressive. Expression is bound up with the totality of the visual elements.23 Rudolf Arnheim offers a specific applica- tion of the idea that expression in art is "transmitted to the eye with powerful direct- ness by the perceptual characteristics of the compositional pattern .... It is indispens- able as to a precise interpreter of the idea the work is meant to express .... Neither the formal pattern nor the subject matter is the final content of the work of art . . ." 24 In other words, every work of art is expres- sive of something beyond so-called objective reality in the sense of passively observed material objects. Expression is a fundamen- tal fact of perception whether in art or in life. Because perception is the product of a subject's interaction with an object, every experienced reality is necessarily expres- sive.25 While contemporary aestheticians have voiced various objections to Langer's and Arnheim's versions of the expression theory, it nevertheless appears that many valiant efforts to distinguish representation and expression as linguistic categories have not unequivocally proved that they are always mutually exclusive types of art. A great deal of the problem can be resolved by noting the semantic confusion over terms like "ex- pression," denoting artistic acts, and "ex- pressiveness," denoting properties of art- works. While most expression theories of art seem to succumb variously to the fallacy of projecting too great a degree of specificity of emotional representation, one can avoid this dilemma by postulating a logical rela- tionship between the structure of the formal elements of a work of art and its expressive dimension. Artists like Van Gogh, Gauguin, or Cezanne do not express feeling states about reality in an art object such that the work is merely the qualitative analogue of those states. The expressiveness of their work does not exist independently of the artist's medium or the particular schema of his personal style. Style is a product of the artist's subjective interaction with objective reality in the case of representational art and although a work may well emerge from an intended "act of emotional expression" (in a different sense of the term), it is not thereby symptomatic of that act, nor does knowledge of such an act affect our perception of the work. The aesthetician and art historian would find it more fruitful to direct their attention to the expressive object in Langer's and Arnheim's senses of the term in order to avoid per- petuating the inadequacies of the more tra- ditional expression theory whether in its attribution of feeling states to the creating artist or in its hypostization of affective states inhering in nonsentient works of art. I am attempting to make the same kind of argument for the visual arts that has frequently been made about music: 170</page><page sequence="9">A False Antinomy Let us grant, then, that music-sadness is differ- ent from life-sadness, and that whatever the psychological causes of the felt similarity may be, it is the music-sadness and not the life- sadness that the music evokes .... The expres- siveness of the music is dependent on neither the experiences of the artist nor the experiences of the audience.26 Most recent theories of expression have carefully delineated the concept from repre- sentation, but they do not conflict with my proposition about the merger of the two would-be divergent kinds of art which is to take them a step further. Nelson Goodman associates representation with denotation and expression with converse denotation or "possession" such that the crucial difference between the usage of the terms is not "a difference in domain" as much as "a differ- ence in direction." In fact, although the terms are distinct and run in opposite directions in terms of the logical relation- ship of the picture to the things it repre- sents and to the things it expresses, they are intimately related modes of symboliza- tion. The dichotomy of representation and expression is a linguistic distinction, but clearly not an essential one, applicable as convenient labels to such extreme instances as naturalism and German or abstract ex- pressionism although it is often just a ques- tion of degree. Goodman's distinction points more properly to different aspects of the same work of art. The representational con- tent of Cezanne's Mt. Sainte-Victoire is (denotes) the actual mountain in southern France. The expressive content (is denoted by) the style or form by means of which the scene is depicted and the metaphoric designation of these forms as emotive. The question of a possible fusion, hinted at but not adequately discussed by Goodman, de- pends upon the nature of the artistic style (e.g., post-impressionism) and the manner in which it is perceived. Richard Wollheim's criticism of Good- man's thesis, that for all its neatness, his formula does not give us anything that we can look on as a final resolution of the traditional questions about representation and expression,27 also applies to the work of Alan Tormey.28 However, Tormey's clari- fication of the usage of the term, expression, 171 has resulted in a widening of the gap be- tween expressive objects and artistic acts and intentions in keeping with my position on the post-impressionists. It is his contention that all forms of the expression theory lean too heavily upon anthropomorphic predicates with reference to an artistic personality. He prefers to dis- tinguish between the expressive properties of a work and represented expressions within a work. For example, Bernini's David represents David-expressing-intense-determi- nation, but the work itself is not necessarily (although it may be) expressive of intense determination. Thus, a kind of reconciliation is achieved between representation and expression in the sense that the representational arts can make expressive comments on their repre- sented content.29 I interpret this as a non- literal kind of artistically mediated expres- siveness to which we erroneously ascribe the intentional acts or private states of persons, but which can more properly be seen as attributes of the perceptual surface of a work. Tormey illustrates expressive ambig- uity as an inherent feature of most if not all works of art in the sense that a work may express various kinds of properties (such as tenderness, yearning, or nostalgia) which seems to eliminate the possibility of a defini- tive reading of the work in terms of specific artistic intentions. Tormey's greatest insight for the purposes of this paper is the effort to prevent the expression theory from treat- ing all of the cognate forms of "expression" as terms whose logical behavior is similar. The particular mistake he notes is the assumption that the existence of expres- sive qualities of an art work implies a prior act of expression. He guides us into re- asserting the fact that expressive qualities of an art work remain, irresolutely, state- ments about the work. In the analytic tradi- tion, Tormey thus clarifies but does not reverse aspects of the modified expression theories of Langer and Arnheim whose focus of attention was on the form of the work in exclusion of the creating artist.30 I have argued here for the correct cate- gorization of post-impressionism and for the correct interpretation of its meaning based</page><page sequence="10">DONNELL-KOTROZO upon contemporary theories regarding the nature of representation and expression. I have also argued conversely that an integra- tion of these concepts, rather than a strict opposition, is now mandatory for aesthetics in the light of the evidence provided by the art movement. Expression is a fundamental component of representation, and only a theory that takes this relationship into consideration is applicable to the history of art in general, and to the post-impres- sionists in particular. 1 Morris Weitz, "Style and Genre," Contemporary Philosophic Thought, Perspectives in Education, Religion, and the Arts, vol. 3, ed.

" Monroe Beardsley defines representation as a relation between a design and objects and events in reality as distinct from the evocation of feelings by the design. Deviations from nature are deemed "distortions" which implies an opposition to a kind of norm of representational accuracy. Monroe Beardsley, Aesthetics (New York, 1958). "2 H. R. Rookmaaker, Synthetist Art Theories (Amsterdam, 1959), p. 72. "3 Shiff, p. 364. The "idea" as an objective entity is postulated: "The Symbolist was seen not as intuitions or emotions out into a world of universal knowledge and experience. What Denis, Aurier, Kahn and others called subjective and objective distortion are fused if the artist's personal vision presenting an internalized subjective experience of an objective world, but as bringing his personal (his 'ideal') is in immediate correspondence with an image of universal expressive power (the 'Idea') -the individual artist would feel and express what all can feel and come to know. In such a case, the art of the individual impression would merge with the art of the universal symbol." Ibid., p. 364-65. '4E. H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 4th ed. (London, 1972). 15 Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art (Indiana- polis, 1976), p. 39. Similarly "Representation is ... disengaged from perverted ideas of it as an idio- syncratic physical process like memory, and is recog- nized as a symbolic relationship that is relative and variable." Ibid. p. 43. 16 Although it does not constitute a complete argument because of the debate over artistic in- tentions and the Intentional Fallacy, recourse to statements by the post-impressionists can docu- ment the view that they did consider themselves as painters of the appearance of nature (albeit not in impressionist terms). It is the evidence of the paintings themselves and their ability to be per- ceived in a certain manner, however, that suggests a strong case for "expressive representation" not mimetic representation, nor pure expressionistic distortion. 17 Goodman, p. 33. Note the similarity to Rudolf Arnheim's statement that "imagination is sometimes misunderstood as the invention of new subject matter . . . actually the achievement of artistic imagination could be described more correctly as the finding of new form for old content . . . rather than distorting reality, imaginative form reaffirms the truth." Rudolph Arnheim, Art and Visual Perception (University of California Press, 1966), p. 141. 28 "The representation of the work of art offers a structural equivalent of the experience that gave rise to it, but the particular concrete form in which that equivalent appears cannot be derived only from the object. It is also determined by the medium." Arnheim, p. ix. 19 Guy Sircello, "Expressive Properties in Art." Philosophy Looks at the Arts, ed. Joseph Margolis (Philadelphia, 1978). "0 Sircello mentions that Goodman's theory of expression seems to depend rather heavily on the opinion that uses of anthropomorphic predicates are metaphorical. 21 "Imitation of other things is not the essential power of images . . . the true power of the image lies in the fact that it is an abstraction, a symbol, the bearer of an idea . . . An image . . . abstracted from the physical and causal order, is the artist's creation." Susanne Langer, Feeling and Form, A Theory of Art (New York, 1953), p. 47. 172</page><page sequence="11">A False Antinomy 22Ibid., p. 128. 23 "A work of art is a single, indivisible symbol . . It is not, like a discourse . . . composite, analyzable into more elementary symbols . . . It can never be constructed by a process of synthesis of elements because no such elements exist out- side it. They only occur in a total form." Ibid., p. 369. 24Arnheim, p. 436-438. 25"Expression can be described as the primary content of vision . . . if expression is the primary content of vision in daily life, the same should be all the more true for the way the artist looks at the world. The expressive qualities are his means of communication. They capture his attention, through them he understands and interprets his experience, and they determine the form patterns he creates." Ibid., pp. 430-31. 26 John Hospers, "The Concept of Artistic Expres- sion," Problems in Aesthetics, ed. Morris Weitz (London, 1970), pp. 232, 242. See also O. K. Bowsma, "The Expression Theory of Art," Aesthetics and Language, ed. William Elton (New York, 1954), who similarly releases expression in music from the bondage of anthropomorphic emotion-conno- tation predicates. 173 27 "To associate representation with denotation and expression with converse denotation (or 'posses- sion,' as Goodman calls it) is not to give their sufficient conditions: at best, it is to give their necessary conditions. Or, to put it another way, Goodman's thesis, as so far unfolded, may bring out the difference, or a very important difference, between representation and expression, but it does not exhibit the nature of either." Richard Woll- heim, On Art and the Mind (London, 1973), p. 292. 28 Alan Tormey, The Concept of Expression (Princeton University Press, 1971). 29 Ibid., p. 139. Also: "It will be convenient to refer to the properties denoted by predicates of this sort as "expressive" properties. Thus, a work ex- pressive of anguish will be sa:d to have the "ex- pressive" property anguish rather than simply the property anguish, the modification serving both to indicate affinities with instances where 'anguish' has unqualified application and to obviate absurd- ities engendered by taking art to exhibit full- blooded sentient states." Ibid., p. 127. 30 Alan Tormey's theory of language which op- poses the absolute separation of "descriptive" and "expressive" linguistic components corroborates the nondualistic position of this paper.</page></plain_text>
