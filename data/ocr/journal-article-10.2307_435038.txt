<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE THIRD INSTALMENT OF ARNOLD'S LITERATURE AND DOGMA FRANCIS G. TOWNSEND IN HIS Studies in the Text of Matthew Ar- nold's Prose Works (Paris, 1935), the late Professor E. K. Brown advanced a theory to account for certain singular circumstances surrounding the composi- tion of Literature and Dogma. This, the most important of Arnold's biblical studies, began as a serial publication in the Cornhill Magazine. Two parts were published there: the first in July, 1871; the second in October, 1871. It is evident that Arnold intended these two instalments to be the opening chap- ters of a full-length book, because near the beginning of his first paper he said that he intended to cover his subject in "three or four essays, one of them (which we shall have to divide into two parts) dealing with literature as it regards dog- ma; another with literature as it regards physics; a third with literature as it re- gards science generally."' At the end of the October instalment, Arnold said: "But to finish our defence of literature against dogma we need one paper more; and perhaps our remarks on miracles will come better at the beginning of that than at the end of this."2 As early as October, 1871, therefore, Arnold had expanded his original prospectus to at least five instal- ments, instead of the four he had an- nounced in July. However, the promised third instal- ment never appeared. That failure led Brown to believe that it had been submit- ted and refused. The third instalment, ac- cording to Brown's theory, was rejected because it was probably like the chapter "The Proof from Miracles" in Literature and Dogma as we have it today, and that chapter might well have been unpalatable to the Cornhill audience. To support this theory Brown adduced two pieces of evidence. First, up to the end of 1871 the Cornhill had been Arnold's chief vehicle of periodical publication; but after October, 1871, only three of Arnold's shorter pieces appeared in it-"A Persian Passion Play" (1871); a poem, "New Rome" (1873); and "A Speech at Eton" (1879). It appears that Arnold's connec- tion with the Cornhill came to a rather sudden end. Brown's second piece of evidence is a letter from Arnold to his brother, dated May 5, 1873, in which Arnold mentioned George Smith, the former editor of the Cornhill, in terms which suggest a quarrel and a reconciliation. The pertinent pas- sage reads as follows: I wish you would look in in Fenchurch Street on George Smith (I think 136 is the number, but you will easily find out), and tell him I now give up hearing from him, but all he has got for me had better go to the Athenaeum, where I shall find it at my return. Tell him that as a proof of the indestructible sweetness of my disposition, and of my viewing his conduct with sorrow rather than with anger, I send him the enclosed trifle for the Cornhill, which I think rather good; and verses I do not often bestow on the public now.3 To sum up, Brown's theory of a reject- ed third instalment depends on two pieces I Cornhill Magazine, XXIV (July, 1871), 27. 2 Ibid., October, 1871, p. 492. 1 Letters of Matthew Arnold, 1848-1888, ed.

TOWNSEND of evidence; first, that the series of articles was interrupted and that thereafter Ar- nold ceased to contribute regularly to the Cornhill and, second, that in May, 1873, Arnold wrote of George Smith in a forgiv- ing tone, as if he were making peace. In addition, there is the suggestive fact that Literature and Dogma is the only one of Arnold's books which did not appear in periodical form. Brown's interpretation of Arnold's ref- erence to George Smith was challenged by Professor William Blackburn, who made a careful study of the background of Litera- ture and Dogma. Blackburn noted that, since the first edition appeared in Febru- ary, 1873, Arnold's letter probably re- ferred to the book, not to the magazine publication. Blackburn explained the composition of Literature and Dogma in this way. Since there is no conclusive evi- dence that the Cornhill Magazine rejected Arnold's articles, "the more plausible ex- planation of Arnold's failure to publish a third paper would seem to be that Litera- ture and Dogma, the most topical of all his works, grew under his hand as he respond- ed more and more to the religious contro- versies raging about him."' The religious controversies of 1871 and early 1872 were indeed bitter, and echoes of them are audible in many of Arnold's pages. In his later work, Matthew Arnold: A Study in Conflict, Brown again argued for his theory of a rejected instalment, this time taking cognizance of the materials assembled by Professor Blackburn. He repeated his contention that the fifth chapter of Literature and Dogma, "The Proof from Miracles," was in existence in the autumn of 1871 but that it was reject- ed by Arnold's publishers; and he offered his own mature interpretation of the form that Literature and Dogma finally as- sumed. According to this interpretation, when Arnold began Literature and Dogma, he was determined to maintain the air of disinterestedness he so carefully cultivat- ed, but after the second instalment of Oc- tober, 1871, he let his material get out of hand because of his growing conviction of crisis. Arnold saw that the masses in Eng- land were abandoning religion. They were not adopting the liberalism of F. D. Mau- rice or the "lofty secular ethic of Huxley" but were turning, instead, to the views of Charles Bradlaugh. Brown's final judg- ment was, in his own words: I assume that the fifth chapter of Literature and Dogma, "The Proof from Miracles," was written in the autumn of 1871 and that all that follows it was written later. One cannot be sure; the manuscript is not known to exist; and there are no statements in the letters which are of help at this point.s Now, if Arnold actually submitted a third instalment to the Cornhill Magazine, either in a complete or in an abbreviated form, then the nature of that instalment is important, and its possible survival in manuscript form is tantalizing. Having examined Brown's evidence and the back- ground study contributed by Professor Blackburn, I offer the following correc- tions and addenda to Brown's theory: (1) Brown's external evidence for a reject- ed third instalment is totally irrelevant; (2) nevertheless, a continuation of Litera- ture and Dogma was rejected by the Corn- hill in late 1871; and (3) Arnold's plan for the third instalment can be reconstructed from his letters and from the text of the work itself. The first of these three points can be made very briefly. The external evidence for a rejected manuscript consists of Ar- nold's letter to his brother, dated May 5, 4 William Blackburn, "The Background of Ar- nold's Literature and Dogma," Modern Philology, XLIII (November, 1945), 131. 6 E. K. Brown, Matthew Arnold: A Study in Con- flict (Chicago, 1948), p. 150.</page><page sequence="3">ARNOLD'S "LITERATURE AND DOGMA" 197 1873, and quoted above. Just eight pages earlier in the Letters there is a much easier explanation of the tone and substance of what Arnold wrote concerning George Smith. In the spring of 1873 Arnold was traveling in Italy, and on April 17, 1873, he wrote to Miss Arnold from Rome: I wrote a long letter to Jane, and begged her to let G. Smith and the Council Office know of my address here; but I conclude she had left London for the Easter holidays when my letter arrived. If you write by the post of the 23rd to the poste restante at Florence your letters will reach us in time. If you write two or three days later, write to the Hotel Cavour, Milan.6 According to this letter, Arnold was keep- ing his correspondents in England in- formed of his forwarding address, and one of those correspondents was G. Smith, of the firm of Smith and Elder, which had just issued the first edition of Literature and Dogma in February. What Brown used as external evidence to support his theory of a rejection by the Cornhill Magazine is nothing but Arnold's playful complaint because Smith had failed to forward his mail. Any other explanation is ruled out by the phrase in the letter of May 5: ". .. all he has got for me had better go to the Athenaeum, where I shall find it at my return." Nevertheless, a continuation of Litera- ture and Dogma was rejected by the Corn- hill Magazine. Neither Brown nor Black- burn took proper notice of the fact that George Smith turned over the editorship of the Cornhill to Leslie Stephen, begin- ning with the March, 1871, issue.7 In a lecture on Arnold, Stephen said: Though some objects of my worship were to him mere wooden idols; though I once satisfac- torily confuted him in an article, now happily forgotten by myself and everybody else; though I was once even his Editor, and forced in that capacity to decline certain articles, on grounds, of course, quite apart from literary merit; yet he was always not only courteous but cordial, and, I may almost say, affection- ate in manner.8 From this offhand statement we learn that the editor of the Cornhill did reject "certain articles" by Arnold, "on grounds quite apart from literary merit." The grounds are not hard to discover. When Stephen was congratulated on his ap- pointment as editor, he responded: "What can one make of a magazine which ex- cludes the only subjects in which reason- able men take any interest: politics and religion?"' The limitations of the Cornhill audience chafed Stephen constantly. To a Mr. Sully, who was writing on pessimism, he issued a warning: "The ordinary per- son, who is the general object of my dread, has never heard of Schopenhauer, but he may vaguely scent infidelity in a German name."'1 To a suggestion by Smith that the Cornhill might be turned into a serious magazine, like the Fortnightly Review, he replied: "To take the Fortnightly tone in regard to politics and theology would be to frighten away all our old readers.""11 Stephen's tenure as editor extended from 1871 to 1882. The articles which he rejected "on grounds quite apart from literary merit" can almost certainly be identified as the concluding portions of Literature and Dogma simply because such an identification fits the facts perfectly. The serial publication of this work was stopped, and the reason for the stoppage is obvious. As the historian Maitland ob- served, "We are more surprised at seeing some part of 'Literature and Dogma' in the pages of the Cornhill, than at not see- ing the residue."'2 6 Letters, II, 110-11. 7 Frederic William Maitland, The Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen (New York, 1906), p. 257. 8 Leslie Stephen, Studies of a Biographer (London, 1899), II, 77-78.

TOWNSEND The case for this identification is even stronger when we note that Stephen allud- ed to some friction between himself and Arnold in a letter to C. E. Norton, Octo- ber 12, 1874: ". .. the last Contemporary is worth looking at . . . for an article of Mat. Arnold's which amuses me. It is Mat in excelsis-the very cheekiest production I have yet seen of his. Really I am fond of him. I fear he does not return the compli- ment."'3 The last two sentences indicate that the friction developed before the autumn of 1874. If the rejection of "cer- tain articles" was at the bottom of it, then there are only two possible identifica- tions, namely, Literature and Dogma or God and the Bible, and of these two possi- bilities the former is by far the more likely. From the foregoing it might seem safe to assume that Professor Brown was right, that a third instalment was in existence, and that it was rejected. Unfortunately, it is not safe, because there is no reason why Stephen had to see a third instalment in order to reject it. When he spoke of re- jecting "certain articles," he might well have meant nothing more than that he suspended the serialization of Literature and Dogma in mid-career. He certainly needed no look at the next instalment to realize that it was going to make trouble. When Arnold promised to discuss mir- acles at the beginning of his third paper, the storm warnings were out. The one safe conclusion, therefore, is that the seri- alization was stopped by the editor, as Professor Brown surmised, and not aban- doned by Arnold when he found his mate- rials getting out of hand, as Professor Blackburn argued. But, even if Leslie Stephen never saw a third instalment, there is no doubt what- soever that Arnold was at work on it in the autumn of 1871. We know from his letters that he had completed the second instalment on September 25, 1871, and that he intended to spend the next three weeks preparing a lecture for delivery to a Birmingham audience.14 The lecture was very favorably received, and on October 17 Arnold notified his mother that it would be printed in the December Corn- hill.1' There is no sign of pique, no indica- tion of friction, in this letter. If we allow about three weeks for the writing of a long and rather difficult lecture, then we have accounted for Arnold's literary labors from September 25 to October 16, 1871; if we grant that his relations with the Corn- hill were still amicable on October 17, then the third instalment of Literature and Dogma was due in January or February, 1872. Working on this hypothesis, let us assume that in late October Matthew Ar- nold resumed work on his biblical criti- cism. How did he plan to continue? In order to answer that question, it is necessary, first of all, to review Arnold's original outline as set forth in the opening paragraphs of the first instalment, July, 1871. His series of four essays was to be a defense of literary criticism and literary studies, a defense divided into two equal parts, one against the aggression of the friends of dogma and the other against the aggression of the friends of physical sci- ence. The book as we have it shows clearly what the first part was to be: the second part was abandoned, and speculation on it is not particularly profitable. My own guess is that Arnold intended to adopt the line of argument found in one of his later essays, "Literature and Science." To return to the first part, which under- went a metamorphosis and emerged as Literature and Dogma-by September 25, 1871, the promised two essays had already is Ibid., p. 245. 14 Letters, II, 73.

The problem is, given two essays on a topic, to plan a third which will complete the discussion. On the face of it, a solution should not be too difficult; and, lest it be thought that the problem is too hypothetical, let us re- call that it is precisely the problem that Arnold had to solve when he promised a third paper at the close of the second in- stalment, October, 1871. Before going further, it might be well to glance at the table of contents of the first edition, February, 1873: CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE INTRODUCTION ..... ........ 1 I.

The second instalment com- prised chapters ii, iii, and iv. The third in- stalment had to include chapter v and more. Now, although it is absurd to be- lieve that the conclusion Arnold planned in October, 1871, was the rest of the com- plete work, it is almost equally absurd to believe that the intended conclusion is not imbedded in the contents of the first edi- tion. The organization of the first two in- stalments points to chapter x as the most probable ending. These instalments follow a clear, logical outline. The first chapter argues that reli- gion, as Israel originally conceived it, was a quest for righteousness and that God, as Israel originally conceived of Him, was not a "Great Personal First Cause" but rath- er, in Arnold's phrase, the Eternal not ourselves that makes for righteousness. In the second chapter Arnold contends that this simple concept of God was obscured by Aberglaube until its austere grandeur yielded to anthropomorphism. In the third chapter Arnold turns to the New Testament. He portrays Christ as the great moral teacher Who revitalized reli- gion with His inwardness, His self-renun- ciation, and His mildness. But, Arnold continues, even Christ's closest followers were so given to materializing, were so much the children of their age, that they could not grasp the true sublimity of the new religion. They insisted on surround- ing Christ's teaching with wonders, both prophetic and miraculous, after the fash- ion of their times; hence, from the very outset, Christians built their religion on prophecy and miracles. The next chapter, "The Proof from Prophecy," discusses the insecurity of such a foundation; and here the second instalment ended. Undoubted- ly, the third was to begin with a discussion of the insecurity of miracles as a founda- tion for religion. If the third instalment was to end with the substance of what became chapter x, then the over-all organization of the three papers in defense of literature against the friends of dogma would be: (1) the rise and decline of religion in the Old Testa- ment; (2) the restoration and decline of re- ligion in the New Testament; (3) the im- possibility of basing religion on prophecy and miracles in the nineteenth century; and (4) the necessity for disengaging reli-</page><page sequence="6">200 FRANCIS G. TOWNSEND gion from dogma and the supernatural, lest the masses ignore the Bible and aban- don the quest for righteousness. Such an outline solves the problem of organization neatly, and it also yields three instalments of approximately equal length. I have cited E. K. Brown's statement that there were no clues in the letters as to the projected third instalment. There is, however, a very definite clue in a letter which Arnold wrote to Father John Henry Newman on November 29, 1871, shortly after the Birmingham lecture. In this let- ter Arnold expressed his regret at not hav- ing seen Newman, acknowledged his in- debtedness to Newman's influence, and asked two questions, of which the first was: "Had you any particular passage of Butler himself in your mind when you said in your Essay on Development, 'Any- how, Analogy is in some sort violated by the fact of a revelation'?'"" Turning to chapter x of the first edition of Literature and Dogma, we find this: "Dr. Newman urges, fairly enough: Butler admits, analo- gy is in some sort violated by the fact of revelation."" In late November, there- fore, Arnold was at work on material later included in chapter x. This scrap of evi- dence by no means proves that chapter x in its final form was designed to follow chapter v, thus providing a satisfactory conclusion to the series; but it does hint that this chapter, in substance at least, preceded chapters vi-ix in order of com- position. The four chapters, vi-ix, are easily ac- counted for. Without going into an elabo- rate analysis, I think it is fair to say that they represent a strenuous effort to rein- force with a mass of specific details the principal proposition of chapter iii, name- ly, that Christ was misunderstood by His own followers but that, despite this fact, the true grandeur of His spiritual teaching is visible through the materializing gloss cast over His career by the first Chris- tians, whom Arnold called "the early wit- nesses." It seems improbable that an ar- gument so deliberate and so detailed could have been intended to serve as a conclusion to the earlier Cornhill papers. The foregoing corrections and addenda modify Professor E. K. Brown's theory so that it covers all the known facts concern- ing the composition of Literature and Dog- ma. Finding two essays inadequate for his defense of letters against the friends of dogma, Arnold promised a third, which was to contain the substance of chapter v. He set to work on this third instalment in late October or early November, 1871, but was notified by Leslie Stephen that the Cornhill would accept no more.'s Freed from deadlines and also from the self-im- posed limits he had announced in his July and October articles, he expanded the work to its present proportions by adding chapters vi-ix and by developing his con- clusions at leisure in the last chapters. 16 Unpublished Letters of Matthew Arnold, ed.

I have looked at a number of advertisements for the January and February issues of the Cornhill, but I have found no mention of Literature and Dogma. Re- viewing the December issues of the leading maga- zines, The Examiner (December 9, 1871) said: "In the Cornhill Mr. Matthew Arnold describes 'A Persian Passion Play,' to which we would have preferred a continuation of the striking papers on 'Literature and Dogma' that he is publishing at intervals in this magazine." I have checked the 1871 and 1872 entries in The Note-Books of Matthew Arnold, edited by Howard Foster Lowry, Karl Young, and Waldo Hilary Dunn (London, 1952), but I see no way to arrive at any order of composition from these entries, although ob- viously Arnold used many of them in the finished work.</page></plain_text>
