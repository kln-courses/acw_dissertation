<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Whose Turban Does the Lord Reside?: The Objectification of Charisma and the Fetishism of Objects in the Hindu Kingdom of Kota NORBERT PEABODY Harvard University The shiny, black stone statue of Shri Nathji that today resides in the busy pilgrimage town of Nathdvara (Rajasthan, India) is the preeminent image of the Vaisnava sect of the Vallabha Sampradaya. Like all statues in the sect, the image is an anthropomorphic manifestation of Krishna, the sect's paramount deity (see Plate 1). More than simply representing Krishna, Vallabhite statues are believed to contain this deity's "immanent presence" and to possess (and emanate) his mystical powers.' In order to partake of these powers, the worship of images is a regular feature of Vallabhite religious practice, and pilgrimage to important temples, such as the Shri Nathji Temple, is a cher- ished goal of all members of the sect.2 This article examines how the Hindu rajas of western India attempted to bind these mystical powers to the service I am grateful to my teachers, S.

Other Hindus, regardless of sectarian affiliation, may (and often do) worship at Vallabha temples. In this respect Hindu sects do not display the same exclusivity as, for example, Christian sects. This tendency towards incorporation did not extend to economically and politically marginal groups (outcastes and tribals), however. These commu- nities traditionally were denied full sectarian initiation. 0010-4175/91/4493-9124 $5.00 ? 1991 Society for Comparative Study of Society and History 726</page><page sequence="2">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 727 of their rule and what consequences this had both for royal action and for the maintenance and perpetuation of the divine powers of the statues themselves. For many years now it has been a commonplace observation in history and anthropology that the monopolistic possession of sacred objects, heirlooms, talismans, or regalia helps perpetuate political rule. More recently Bourdieu (1977), who has made great academic capital from the expression "symbolic capital," has shown that the tight regulation of exchange in specially demar- cated objects not only sanctions but also constitutes privilege by establishing which referential coordinates of value are natural and legitimate. Kopytoff (1986) has elaborated upon this insight with his discussion of how certain objects are imbued with "cultural biographies" that singularize them, result- ing in their fetishism (to expand Marx's coinage), while removing them from more promiscuous and uncontrollable spheres of exchange. However, the kings in western India faced the unusual problem that the mobility of their statuary was notoriously mercurial and not subject to direct royal manage- ment. This capricious mobility, an essential part of their pedigree (or biogra- phy) and crucial to sustaining the images' powers, at the same time threatened to undermine dynastic stability and royal authority which, territorially based in India, was not so itinerant. OF STATUES AND KINGS One witnesses an unresolved tension between these two processes in the late seventeenth-century sectarian account of the Shri Nathji statue's origins and migration to Nathdvara, the SrL Nathji kf Prakatya Vdrtd (or SNPV), which links the presence of the Shri Nathji statue to several Hindu kingdoms.3 According to this chronicle, in 1669 the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb forced the Shri Nathji statue to flee his original home near Mathura (Uttar Pradesh) and seek refuge with the Hindu rajas of western India. For two years, fear of Aurangzeb's Muslim armies kept the image on the move, and Shri Nathji's regress temporarily graced the Hindu kingdoms (and kings) of Bundi, Kota, Jodhpur, and Kishangarh before finding permanent sanctuary at Nathdvara in what was then the kingdom of Mewar (Udaipur) (see Plate 2). A chorus of oral traditions concerning the wanderings of lesser Vallabha deities during the unsettled late seventeenth century echoes the literary legacy of the SNPV. One of these widespread traditions provides background for the popular Vallabhite expression borrowed in this article's title. It recounts that Vallabha deities often eluded the imminent arrival of the "iconolastic Mughal horde" by being concealed in the turbans of temple servants (most Vallabha images are only a 3 The SNPV, or "An Account of the Manifestation of Shri Nathji," was composed in the vernacular Braj Basha by Goswami Harirayji (who lived the proverbial 125 years from 1590- 1715). A portion of the SNPV has been translated into English by Vaudeville (1980). Legends of Shri Nathji's travels also figure in royal chronicles, such as the Vfr Vinod of Shyamal Das (1886:452-53).</page><page sequence="3">728 NORBERT PEABODY few centimeters tall) and whisked away undercover to new locales of safe haven.4 This hide-and-seek derivation of "In whose turban does the Lord reside?" thus combines the mobility of Vallabha statues with an avatar of the classic Weberian problem of the volatility of charismatic authority. Tambiah (1984) recently has engaged just this combination of concerns in the context of the Theravada kingdoms of Southeast Asia. He charted the odysseys of the Sin- hala Buddha statue against the backdrop of rising and falling dynastic fortunes in the multicentered political galaxy of Southeast Asian kingdoms, prin- cipalities, and dependencies from the late thirteenth through the eighteenth centuries. In doing so he found that these travels usefully served as a Baedeker's guide to the shifting nuclei of political power and attainment from one polity to the next. The changing ownership of the Sinhala palladium, moreover, was neither merely a poetic index nor solely a Malinowskian mythic charter of these shifting centers; instead, fact and fiction became one as the historically authenticated travels of the Sinhala Buddha statue actually heralded changes in political ascendancy. According to Tambiah (1984:241), this phenomenon was an outcome of two interrelated sources of legitimacy claimed by charismatic Buddhist kings: One [source of legitimacy] was the claim of being a cakkavatti [universal monarch] or a dharmardja [righteous ruler] on the basis of personal achievement and commitment to Buddhist norms of kingship. These positions . . . are not so much inherited as proven by individual karma and meritorious conduct. Though these positions cannot be inherited, those attaining them can claim to be incarnations and avatdras of arche- typal heroes. A second basis, linked with the foregoing, is the possession of palladia and regalia, which are enduring sedimentations and objectifications of power and virtue. Posses- sion of them is a guarantee of legitimacy. But these sedimentations of virtue and power will remain with the possessor for as long as he is virtuous and deserving. They cannot be removed from their locations against their consent; and their travels are evidence of their changing hands and their passage from one deserving ruler to another. Thus Tambiah, who combines the travels of Buddhist sacra with processes of political legitimation, has devised a lively jig from the familiar steps of Marx and Mauss on the fetishism of objects and Weber on the routinization of charismatic authority. In this exercise, Tambiah has accomplished two things. First, he has shown how the strategems and maneuverings of competing political actors for control over statues, in turn, became inscribed in their biographies, resulting in an intensification of their sanctioning powers. Sec- ond, he has developed a notion of "achieved" charismatic authority that differs in emphasis from more common institutionalized claims to such status 4 The Shri Nathji image is somewhat atypical in that it is three-fifths life-size. This fact, however, has not hobbled the statue's tradition of mobility. See Plate 4 for an image of more typical dimensions.</page><page sequence="4">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 729 through genealogical descent or tenure of office. Tambiah effects this by linking personal accomplishments and virtuous deeds (in this case represented by the protection of statutes) with retrospective legitimation in terms of rein- carnation of famous predecessors. The first part of this article examines the significance of Tambiah's analysis for an understanding of legitimacy in the Hindu kingdom of Kota. Located in the present-day state of Rajasthan some 300 kilometers southwest of Mathura, Kota has been associated with the movement of several important Vallabha statues from the late seventeenth century until 1948, when the kingdom merged into independent India. During this period Kota was allied to several different imperial powers: to the Mughals in Delhi until the early eighteenth century, then to the Marathas of central India from the mid-eighteenth through early nineteenth centuries, and finally to the British after 1817. Except for the later half of the colonial era (after the Mutiny of 1857-58), Kota possessed considerable autonomy within these imperial frameworks that often expressed itself in thinly masked hostilities and open rebellion against the paramount power. Although imperial authority played an undeniable role in validating king- ship in Kota (as will be revealed in Part One), the often paradoxical relations with those superordinate powers caused the rulers in Kota to seek, in addition, a more local source of legitimacy. This source stemmed from the possession of renowned Vallabha statuary. The following analysis will reveal that the politi- cal significance of possessing such statuary parallels Tambiah's Theravadan case in important ways. However, closer examination of factors steering the travels of the Vallabha statues into and out of Kota uncovers a complexity not present in the Buddhist context. Although both the brahmanical lineages in the Vallabha Sampradaya and the sangha in Thailand enjoyed a custodial role in maintaining the mystical powers of temple statuary, the brahmanical custody included control over the movements of the most important Vallabha statuary, whereas Buddhist monks enjoyed no such license over Buddha statues. This priestly responsibility significantly affected the exercise of royal power and adds yet another dimension to the processes of royal legitimation in the Indian context. Part Two of this article then confronts what might be Tambiah's most significant theoretical contribution to the anthropology of things: his analysis of the processes whereby, once objects have been invested with mystical powers that are theoretically infinite and unmeasurable, such objects can be depleted of those powers when commoditized and exposed to the capricious forces of the marketplace. Tambiah's investigation of Buddhist amulets shows that after they become inbued with sacred powers (ostensibly through con- secration by Buddhist saints of the forest who have accumulated a vast and limitless supply of merit), they can lose these powers through "the process of</page><page sequence="5">730 NORBERT PEABODY vulgar materialization" (by being traded, bought, and sold in the bazaar and subjected to the unsteadying influence of production, supply, and demand). Tambiah notes two consequences of this process (1984:336): One is that the amulet moves from the context of donation and love (mettd) to a context of trade and profit: It is converted into a highly salable good and enters the bazaar and marketplace. ... A second consequence is that the more they are purchasable for money, the more they deteriorate in their mystical powers (despite the inflationary spiral of prices for the rare antiques). This means that new amulets come into fashion and many others are condemned to be forgotten or less desired; moreover, the propen- sity to accumulate amulets increases, in the simple arithmetic calculation that the more you possess, the more clout you have. Thus the comparison of the relative virtues of amulets leads to mystical power itself, which is both limitless and rare, being gradu- ated, weighed in the balance, or quantified in terms of money. Although Tambiah's analysis of the mechanisms whereby objects lose their power (and their equated value) is apt, it is perplexing that he restricts his argument to amulets; he remains strangely mute on the economic forces that undermine the value of temple statuary. This silence is curious because Tam- biah had devoted considerable space earlier in his study to the sacralization rites that initially transfer potency to both amulets and statues. Perhaps this omission is due to the fact that the Sinhala Buddha never entered the mar- ketplace as an object of exchange, and for Tambiah exchange seems to be the unique mechanism by which the mystical and theoretically limitless powers of sacred objects are given a graded value subject to fluctuation.5 In my analysis of the rising and falling powers of Vallabha statues I will argue that exchange is not necessary for an object to achieve a quantifiable value. Instead, the power of Vallabha statuary is graded and subject to variation without ever being placed in what Appadurai (1986:15) has called a "commodity context." At the same time, however, I will show that this does not mean that these powers are immune from the workings of the economy. PART ONE This part is divided into four sections whose analytic design is as follows: The first two sections will lay out the indigenous conceptual link between the possession of statuary and the validation of authority within the Sampradaya (Section 1) and within the polity (Section 2). The following sections will then show how statues link these two realms of authority through requisite rituals of refortification (Section 3) and through patronage and political success (Section 4). 5 Tambiah does give brief mention to the fact that the powers attributed to the Sinhala Buddha statue have undergone a decline and, in recent years, a subsequent renaissance (1984:239-40). However, he offers no solid explanations for this occurrence.</page><page sequence="6">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 731 I. The Bhakti Sect of Vallabhacarya The devotional (bhakti) sect of the Vallabha Sampradaya was founded by the Vaishnava saint Vallabhacarya (1479?-1531). A Telegu brahman from south India, Vallabhacarya is now closely associated with the region of Braj in which the "historical" Krishna is said to have lived and in which the divine image of Shri Nathji first appeared miraculously from the earth. Devotional sects, with their supposed emphasis on egalitarian values and emotional con- gregational styles of worship, are typically characterized in the academic literature as opposed in some manner to brahmanical Hinduism, which is associated (typically) with the hierarchy of caste, ritual formalism, and the belief that liberation (moksa) from the karmic cycle of rebirths can only be achieved (exceptionally) by the individual renunciation of worldly attach- ments.6 Paradoxically, although Vallabha doctrine discounts the importance of asceticism to liberation, it elevates the practices of the householder (grhastha), the second of four Hindu stages of life (asramas), to an important means of achieving this end. Among the householder's responsibilities are the duties of procreation, performing sacrifices (especially to ancestors), and living in the community. This last duty entails a commitment, among other things, to the concerns of caste.7 This orientation rests in large part on Vallabhacarya's philosophical accep- tance of the fundamental reality of the world and his coincident rejection of the Shankaracaryan system of mayavada whereby the world is regarded as illusion (maya). Lynch (1988:190-1) suggests that Vallabhacarya's doctrine resulted in the development of what he calls "this worldly mysticism" in which the individual "does not try to transcend the natural and profane to reach the supernatural and sacred . . . [but] rather. . . tries to experience more correctly that the natural, the profane, and the self are the supernatural, the sacred, and the divine." The positive religious valuation that Vallabhacarya placed on the house- holder's worldly concerns has several outcomes that can be mentioned here only briefly. In the ritual domain, the worship of a Vallabha image in its havell (temple, literally mansion) is designed to ensure the utmost physical comfort of the deity as if he or she were a sentient being. Thus, the image's raiment and decoration, musical entertainments, offerings of food, and daily activities (sleeping, bathing, playing, and so forth) are all mindfully adjusted to be appropriate to both the time of day and the seasonal cycles of weather and 6 Singer (1972), Pocock (1973), and Ishwaran (1980) have all argued variants of this thesis, and Van der Veer (1987) has recently leveled an important review and critique of it. 7 For more on the significance of the householder within the Vallabha Sampradaya, see Barz (1976:32-33), Jindel (1976:180-8), Lynch (1988:178-80). For the duties of the householder more generally throughout Hinduism, see Madan (1987) and Manu (1982:III).</page><page sequence="7">732 NORBERT PEABODY holidays. Similarly, the hagiography of Vallabhacarya places great emphasis on his marriage and domestic life and pointedly mentions that he became a renouncer only one month before his death. A notable consequence of this concern with Vallabhacarya's family life has been that his progeny continue to monopolize religious authority within the sect. Members of the Sampradaya (sect) believe that Vallabhacarya and his agnatic descendants are avatars of Krishna himself who intervene in this degenerate black age (kali yuga) in order to help devotees overcome "their wrong perception and wrong attitude toward the world" (Lynch 1988:178) and develop the proper vision and experience of it.8 Through this freely bestowed intercession devotees receive the gift of grace (pusti) that allows them to achieve salvation. For this reason, members of the Vallabha Sampradaya are commonly called Pustimdrgis (fol- lowers of the path of grace). Initially, the supernatural power to intercede on behalf of individuals rested solely with Vallabhacarya, and as a result sectarian authority remained un- divided. But as "the celestial tree of the Vallabha family" flourished, the divine legacy of Vallabhacarya devolved to all his agnatic offspring (known as Goswdmls), and authority within the sect became dispersed. Today each of these Goswamis (ad)ministers to his own followers, and the Goswami's pre- rogatives include the authority to initiate members into the Sampradaya and to distribute images for worship by lay devotees. Despite the diffusion of authority, the senior members of eight patrilineages descending from Vallabhacarya's second son, Vitthalnath Gosainji, enjoy special status within the sect. This status rests on their possession of certain statues of divine origin known as the nine treasures (nav nidhi) that once belonged to Vallabhacarya and that are now deeply venerated by the public. According to tradition, Vallabhacarya had collected these images during his lifetime and passed them to Vitthalnath Gosainji, who then dispersed them among his sons (see Plate 3).9 These eight major stem lineages may be numerically ranked according to their seniority of descent from Val- labhacarya, and the potency of the statues that they possess may be similarly graded with the Shri Nathji statue accorded to the supreme position. The powers attributed to Hindu images are legion, and Vallabhite statues are, in this regard, no exception. Pustimargis regularly affirm the ability of their deities to fulfill their heartfelt desires (manorath). The SNPV itself recounts how the statue of Shri Nathji satisfied numerous entreaties of devo- tees such as curing infertility, finding brides for sons, returning lost cattle, and 8 As agents of divine intercession, the descendants of Vallabhacarya are much like Buddhist bodhisattvas except that these descendants do not seek to liberate the individual from worldly attachments as a bodhisattva does. 9 Succession to lineage leadership proceeds according to primogeniture. The superior status of first ranking lineage is indexed by its possession of two images: Shri Nathji and Shri Navanit Priya.</page><page sequence="8">PLATE 1.

Some images enjoy particular renown for their ability to grant the requests of devotees, and pilgrims from all over India travel to let their wishes be known directly to these deities and, of course, to give offer- ings. As a result several Vallabha temples have become quite wealthy, and today the Shri Nathji Temple in Nathdvara is reported to be one of the richest in all of India (Jindel 1976:142). Accounts of early European travellers indi- cate that this is not a recent phenomenon (Tod 1983:I, 418-24). Due to this veneration, these images have become the objects of property disputes (which now involve the modem state) and famous historical instances of theft. In addition, the powers associated with these statues have made them important actors in the political struggles of western India. I now turn to the case of the Vallabhite statue of Shri Brijnath, Kota's golden tutelary deity (see Plate 4), and look at how the travels of this statue have been used in a mid-nineteenth- century royal chronicle (vamsa prasasti) of Kota, written by Kavi Raja Laksman Dan, to validate claims of kingly legitimacy. II. Kota and the Image of Shri Brijnath In examining Laksman Dan's royal chronicle I am proposing an unexceptional and oft-deployed extension of discourse analysis into the domain of indige- nous historical writings.10 I use this text to identify the phenomena that previous local actors valued and the distinctive patterns of their combination that together constituted the "native" referential coordinates of kingship and, through it, the past. 1 Thus my aim is to uncover which events and categories accord with indigenous historical consciousness or to discover, as Dirks (1987:58) has so aptly put it, "in what sense the past exists for the text." The principal benefit of such an approach is that it does not privilege a Western historiography that may obscure local constructions of time-oriented experi- ence and, hence, the logic of action built upon them. Later, I shall then oppose this native view with the perspective of the anthropologist-historian whose own view, in some respects, is larger than that of the individual actor- chronicler (one hopes) and who is able to interrelate indigenous categories with personal interests and projects that may be manifest as well as latent, conscious as well as unconscious, and self-evident as well as intentionally misrepresented. Laksman Dan was a poet-bard whose family had been attached hereditarily to the royal court for the purposes of composing such genealogical texts and praise poems, and his text is a variant of a long Indian tradition of dynastic chronicling that, in addition to enumerating the male offspring of royal lin- eages, records kingly acts, such as military conquests, donations to brahmans, 10 Laksman Dan's text is historical in the double sense of its age and subject matter. 1 l Here I am obviously indebted to the exemplary works of Tambiah (1976), Errington (1979), and Dirks (1987) among others.</page><page sequence="13">734 NORBERT PEABODY and prominent public works (particularly the construction of temples, tanks, city walls and gates, and palaces).12 One of the many agendas of such chroni- cles is to justify the ruling lineage's claims to whatever patrimony it may possess (or wishes to possess). Laksman Dan's text, however, is forced to accommodate the uncomfortable (from our perspective) fact that although primogeniture was the preferred practice for royal succession, there are numerous historical instances when "cadet" branches of the stem line "usurped" the throne. Several narrative strategies, including the appearance and disappearance of the kingdom's palladium, are employed to justify these actions. We shall concern ourselves here with that part of the chronicle that covers the first half of the eighteenth century, when the statue of Shri Brijnath made its first appearance in Kota, subsequently left, and eventually returned. The period of these travels embraces the reigns of three Kota rulers: Maharao Bhim Singh I (r. 1707-20), Kota's most illustrious king who also became Kota's first ruler to take initiation into the Vallabha Sampradaya; and Bhim's sons, Arjun (r. 1720-23) and Durjan Sal (r. 1723-57), during whose reigns a bitter civil war was fought. Bhim Singh's reign commenced the same year as the death of Aurangzeb (1707) and coincided with imperial Mughal decline. Administrative records show that Bhim took advantage of the political weak- ness in Delhi to increase his domain six-fold and transform Kota from a petty principality of minor consequence to a regional power whose influence (direct and indirect) extended over much of southern Rajasthan and parts of Malwa. 13 Let us now pick up Laksman Dan's account at the point just before Bhim Singh took initiation into the Vallabha Sampradaya and established the image of Shri Brijnath as Kota's tutelary deity. In 1719 Bhim Singh travelled to Delhi 12 This unpublished text, written in a corrupted form of Hindi that employs many Persian and Hadouti idioms, is in the possession of Kavi Raja Mahipat Singh of Kotri, a descendant of Laksman Dan. I would like to thank Mahipat Singh for generously sharing this manuscript with me. The text probably was written just after the Mutiny of 1857-58 (Gupta 1979:137; R. P. Shastri 1971:12) and was appended subsequently. After the Mutiny, the British questioned the loyalty of Maharao Ram Singh of Kota (r. 1827-65), and as a result Ram Singh feared being deposed. The text, therefore, seeks to buttress Ram Singh's uncertain hold on the throne by portraying him as the rightful heir of an unbroken sovereign line that had ruled Kota (in one form or another) since the early thirteenth century. This text thus serves a traditional function. In fact, many of the historical portions of the account (concerning events prior to Laksman Dan's own lifetime), including those discussed below, are cribbed from earlier chronicles of the region such as Suraj Mal Mishran's Vam.a Bhdskar (1899) which was originally written early in the nine- teenth century. 13 Between 1714 and 1719 Bhim Singh annexed the Mughal pargand (district) of Shahbad and conquered the following neighboring Hindu kingdoms: Sheopur, Bundi, Rajgarh, Raghogarh, Narsinghgarh, Patan, and Kilchipur; finally in 1720 he took Manohar Thana from its tribal chieftain (Sharma 1940:299-302). Earlier in his reign Bhim Singh had also consolidated control over several districts (Mhow, Shergarh, Baran, Mangrol, and Barod) that had intermittently been under Kota's rule (Sharma 1940:264-5).</page><page sequence="14">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 735 in order to pay his respects to the new Emperor Muhammad Shah. The Kota Maharao had been instrumental in supporting the court faction of Sayyid Husain Ali that put this puppet emperor on the Peacock Throne:14 In the year Samvat 1775 [A.D. 1719] Emperor Muhammad Shah ascended the throne, and Vazir Sayyid Husain Ali beseeched him that "Your Majesty should take recogni- tion of the fact that your good fortune is due to Maharao Bhim Singh." Thus Muham- mad Shah summoned Maharao Bhim Singh and said, "Ask for whatever land you want and consider it granted." To which the Maharao replied, "I ask only that whatever land I subdue through the strength of the sword be mine." Sayyid Husain Ali objected, "This liberty is unacceptable and will cause great destruction." But Maharao Bhim Singh insisted, "If you are happily granting something, then don't grant that which I do not want." So at this time Muhammad Shah gave Maharao Bhim Singh nine gold coins and a canopy [both symbols of royalty] and said, "I grant you in perpetuity whatever land you seize by the strength of your sword and bravery." This proclamation was written and taken by Maharao Bhim Singh who, having offered his respects to the emperor, departed for his capital at Kota (Laksman Dan n.d.:24-25). This prelude is significant because it posits a dual construction of kingship in Kota. On the one hand, Maharao Bhim Singh derives royal honours (the coins and canopy) and the legitimacy they represent from the paramount power above. In this conventional top-down construction of kingship, legiti- macy flows out and down from an imperial center (Delhi) to the periphery (Kota). On the other hand, the Kota ruler rejects the emperor's outright gift of land and insists on establishing sovereignty himself from the ground up through conquest and the merit of his own deeds. As in Tambiah's Theravada case, this desire to demonstrate one's merit through action is an aspect of larger Hindu-Buddhist concerns with karmic attainment and the transmigra- tion of souls whereby proven leaders are regarded as incarnations or avatars of archetypal warrior heroes. 5 In north India the most frequently invoked heroes are the Hindu kings Prithvi Raj and Rana Pratap, who both gained celebrity for resisting Islamic penetration into India. In Kota, along with these exem- plars is included none other than Maharao Bhim Singh, whose image the Kota royal lineage still worships at Dasahra (the annual festival that ritually recon- stitutes kingship). In the next episode of Laksman Dan's chronicle, the ground-up construc- tion of legitimacy based on karmic attainment is explicitly linked to the Vallabha Sampradaya, thus revealing that the dual construction of kingship is an aspect of a paradoxical relationship between royal and priestly orders. After Bhim Singh visited Delhi, he immediately proceeded to the sacred city 14 All translations from Laksman Dan are my own. 15 The importance of proving one's merit as a king through conquest also accords with Lingat's insight (1973:210) that the royal caste historically was open to outsiders and that Hindu "kingship, then, belonged to him who possessed ksatra de facto, the imperium, 'empire' in the broad sense, i.e. the power to command, whatever might have been his birth and whatever might have been the circumstances that brought him to the throne."</page><page sequence="15">736 NORBERT PEABODY of Mathura where he was initiated into the Vallabha Sampradaya and endowed with the tutelary statue of Shri Brijnath. On reaching Mathura and having bathed . ... , Maharao Bhim Singh distributed mon- ey and food to brahmans in an appropriate manner. At his encampment, he then changed his name to Krishna Das [servant of Krishna] and changed the names of Kota and Shergarh to Nanda Gaon and Barsana. 16 The city of Kota . . . was dedicated to Shri Nathji and until this day the rental income from the city and the palace go to Nathdvara on a tax-free basis. Maharao Bhim Singh then worshipped Shri Brijnath according to the practice of the Vallabha Sampradaya. After which, on the pretense of being ill, he concealed himself in his tent and, proclaiming that he had died from this sickness, constructed an effigy of himself and cremated it. This caused a great lamentation to spread throughout the land. In [the neighboring kingdom of] Bundi, Salim Singh [the ruler] heard this and started to pillage the lands of Kota with a formidable army. . . . News of this invasion was sent to Mathura .... [Soon thereafter, having returned to Kota] Maharao Bhim Singh caused the rumour to be spread among Salim Singh's troops that Bhim Singh's ghost was coming. . . . On account of being a simple man, Salim Singh also became frightened . . . and Salim Singh fled [Kota]. ... He was followed by Maharao Bhim Singh as far as Bundi .... When he arrived, Salim Singh had closed the city gates, but on the morning of the next day, the gate was broken by a siege elephant. The Maharao's lethal sword entered the city, where his soldiers raised ladders and entered the citadel. Wherever the Maharao's sword went, men fell in masses. So Salim Singh slipped away from the city and fled (Laksman Dan n.d.: 25-26). The events surrounding Bhim Singh's initiation encode several important meanings. First, the cremation (along with the worship of Shri Brijnath and the changing of names) signify his conversion and rebirth into the Vallabha Sampradaya. However, such a dramatic form of conversion is not usual within the sect-receiving a sacred mantra from a Goswami usually suffices. Among most Hindus, ritual cremation customarily accompanies the act of renuncia- tion. If one interprets Bhim Singh's cremation as an attempt to renounce, it is then important that Bhim Singh abandons this intention, reassumes the duties of kingship, and thus ultimately reaffirms the sect's distinctive nonascetic position. 17 Bundi's military threat to Kota at the time of Bhim Singh's conversion is also revealing because it belies the existence of a paradoxical relationship between the security of the polity and the Sampradaya. While, on the one hand, Bhim Singh's conversion to the Vallabha Sampradaya endows him with the tutelary image of Shri Brijnath, on the other, his conversion actually precipitates Bundi's invasion and near destruction of Kota. Though the im- 16 Shergarh was a strategic fortified city protecting Kota's southern frontier. Nanda Gaon is the village where Krishna's foster father, Nanda, lived, and Barsana is the village where the Radha (Krisna's consort) lived. By changing these names Bhim Singh attempted to inscribe the sacred geography from various Krishna legends upon his own territories. 17 The dire consequences of the king's desire to renounce, of course, is a common theme in all forms of Hinduism, but I would argue that it resonates with a special intensity for adherents of the Vallabha Sampradaya.</page><page sequence="16">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 737 plications of this paradox for king-priest relations are not developed further by Laksman Dan (unsurprisingly, considering his royal patronage), this point will reemerge later in my analysis. Laksman Dan's account next elaborates upon the tutelary powers associated with the image of Shri Brijnath and shows how possession of the image becomes a powerful source of royal legitimacy. After Bhim Singh returns to Kota and rescues the kingdom, Laksman Dan (n.d.:44) notes that: [He] built a temple in his palace where the image of Shri Brijnath was installed. [However,] there was a convention that, wherever Maharao Bhim Singh proceeded in war, the image of Shri Brijnath was installed on an elephant and exposed in the front line of battle. The protective powers implied by this practice were amply validated during the following year as Kota's army, with Shri Brijnath at its head, conquered numerous surrounding kingdoms and territories. In addition to Bundi, among those listed by Laksman Dan are Sheopur, Raghogarh, Kilchipur, Naya Qila, Rajgarh, and Narsinghgarh (see Plate 1). Bhim Singh's successes continued until 1720, when Laksman Dan recounts that the Maharao met with misfortune during a campaign against Asaf Jah Nizam-ul-Mulk (a rebellious Muslim feudatory of the Mughal emperor). Nizam-ul-Mulk laid a "treacherous ambush" for Bhim Singh in which the Kota ruler was killed. Along with this loss, the elephant carrying Kota's palladium was captured and taken to Nizam-ul-Mulk's capital at Hyderabad. The catastrophe of Shri Brijnath's falling into Muslim hands was lessened somewhat when a Hindu "merchant (seth) in Hyderabad solicited this image [from Nizam-ul-Mulk] . . . and built a temple nearby [in the Hyderabad ba- zaar], installed the image, and spent hundreds of thousands of rupees from his household on its worship" (Laksman Dan n.d.:44). During the brief reign of Bhim's successor and eldest son, Arjun, Laksman Dan notes that the god remained in Hyderabad and the silver image of Shri Giridhar was substituted in the Kota palace temple. During this same period, many of Kota's feudatories regained independence. Upon the premature death of the heirless Arjun, moreover, a struggle for the throne broke out between his two younger brothers, Shyam and Durjan Sal. (Indeed one may speculate that this civil war was the cause of Arjun's death.) According to primogeniture Shyam should have inherited the throne next, but as he was absent from Kota when Arjun died, Durjan Sal had himself consecrated Maharao. Shyam re- sponded by marching on Kota at the head of an army from Jaipur. In order to counter Shyam's claim, Durjan Sal attempted to validate his position by recovering the image of Shri Brijnath. When [Maharao] Durjan Sal ascended the throne in the year Samvat 1780 [A.D. 1723], he made repeated efforts to have [Shri Brijnath] returned to Kota. Eventually, [Kota's prime minister] was sent to Hyderabad, and with some trouble he brought Shri</page><page sequence="17">738 NORBERT PEABODY Brijnath back to Kota the following year. [Maharao] Durjan Sal greeted the image with great pomp at a distance of 25 kos [80 kilometers] from the kingdom, and then reinstalled the image in the Kota temple. The civil war ended a few years later, when Durjan Sal killed his brother. In securing an uncontested claim to the throne, Durjan Sal also reconsolidated his control over the kingdom including several of the feudatories that had become independent during Arjun's reign. Several aspects of Laksman Dan's account deserve comment. First, the initial appearance of Shri Brijnath in Kota in 1719 is the crowning achieve- ment of Bhim Singh's career, occurring shortly before he died and coinciding with the demonstration of his virtue, insofar as he conquered other kingdoms and, importantly, upheld religion through his support of brahmans and tem- ples. Second, the statue of Shri Brijnath not only demonstrates miraculous healing powers (Bhim rose from the dead!) but also tutelary powers over the kingdom (Kota is preserved from foreign domination).18 However, these pro- tective powers are operative only to the extent that the ruler is deserving and meritorious. The deity presides over the exemplary reigns of Bhim Singh and Durjan Sal and absents himself during the ignoble reign of Arjun Singh. The worthiness of these three reigns is indexed further by the graded baseness of the metal of the presiding diety; unlike the golden Shri Brijnath of Bhim Singh and Durjan Sal, Arjun Singh's Shri Giridhar is merely silver.19 Finally, the reappearance of Shri Brijnath in Kota in 1724 legitimates Durjan Sal's "usur- pation" by linking his rule with the illustrious reign of Bhim Singh through their common possession of and devotion for the kingdom's palladium. Although we are unable to substantiate the historicity of Laksman Dan's claims regarding the travels of Shri Brijnath, the rhetoric of his text is signifi- cant because it betrays that the indigenous construction of royal legitimacy is tied to the travels of statues in ways paralleling Tambiah's findings in Thailand. Much of the rest of this article will be devoted to showing how fact and fiction converge in Kota, though perhaps with some different implications than Laksman Dan intended in his text. Although Laksman Dan's account is useful because it alerts us to key elements of the cultural construction of power from which any analysis must start, we must be careful not to privilege blindly this "native point of view," if for no other reason than it may not have been shared by all the natives. Let me emphasize that Laksman Dan's dis- course on kingship was necessarily shaped by the fact that he was writing for a royal patron. Therefore, although it reveals the important political value of the possession of statues, his account is naturally only partial. In the next section I shall confront Laksman Dan's account with an analysis of how the images 18 The apparent inability of Shri Brijnath to protect Bhim Singh from Nizam-ul-Mulk is rationalized and dismissed by the fact that the Muslim commander employed deceit and treachery. 19 The symbolism of metals, in turn, should remind us of the distinction between the first two Hindu eras (yugas), the krta (gold), and tretd (silver).</page><page sequence="18">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 739 themselves are empowered. This concern will broaden our understanding of legitimacy to include matters that Laksman Dan strategically did not represent (or underrepresent) and that involve a crucial role for the sectarian authority of the Vallabha Sampradaya. In doing so a more complex picture of royal legiti- macy will begin to emerge. III. The Empowerment of Images One apparent anomaly in Kota is that although Shri Brijnath is the kingdom's tutelary deity, he is far from the kingdom's most revered deity. This honour belongs to the Vallabha image of Shri Mathuresh,20 whose temple is found in the heart of Kota's main bazaar about a kilometer from the Maharao's pal- ace-a peculiar situation, given the normal propensity of kings to buttress their position with the strongest divine sanctions available. In order to under- stand why Shri Brijnath, and not Shri Mathuresh, should be the tutelary deity of Kota (an answer I devilishly shall not reveal until much later), we must first appreciate the manner in which Vallabha images are ritually empowered. Through this analysis of ritual I hope to establish one of the ways in which royal authority and sectarian authority are indigenously linkei. Pustimargis oppose the terms, svarup and murti, to differentiate their re- ligious images from those of other Hindu groups. Murti is used (somewhat pejoratively within the sect) to mark non-Vallabha statues that pass through a consecration rite such as the life-breath ceremony (pran-pratistha) before being suitable for worship. During such ceremonies the immanent presence of the deity is activated in the statue by brahman priests who transfer their vital energies to it through the recitation of Sanskrit mantras.21 After performance of the life breath ceremony, however, the deity may not choose to reside permanently in the statue. The deity is free to come and go as she or he pleases, and should the statue ever be damaged accidentally, it would no longer be suitable for worship. By contrast, the immanent presence of Lord Krishna eternally inheres in the material substance of a Vallabha svarup, meaning essential (sva) form (rup), which always remains divine. Hence there are no periodic rites in which the deity is inveighed to retake residence in the image, and a svaruip must be worshipped continuously lest the deity suffer any deprivation. Among their own statuary Pustimargis further distinguish between a limited group of images that enjoy the attribution of divine genesis (known as nidhi- svarups) and an unnumbered group of man-made images (known as pusti- svarups).22 Numerous popular texts recount the mystical origins of the 20 Alternatively, Shri Mathuradhis or Shri Mathuranath. 21 Descriptions and discussions of the prdn-pratisthd appear in Eck (1985:52-55), Kane (1974:896-903), and Tripathi (1978:254-61). 22 Nowhere is there a definitive enumeration of all the divine statues (nidhi-svarups) although typically there are said to be thirty, thirty-six, or some other auspicious number. For example, see [Mulji] (1865:100).</page><page sequence="19">740 NORBERT PEABODY nidhi-svarups (hereafter called divine images or divine svarups). Typically, Vallabhacarya and his early disciples discovered the divine images, which miraculously appeared from the earth in full iconic form, unblemished by a human sculptor's imperfections. The SNPV narrates how Shri Nathji emerged partially from the earth on Mt. Govardhan near Mathura before the birth of Vallabhacarya but had been misidentified and improperly worshipped by the local inhabitants of the land. Later when Vallabhacarya was a young man, Shri Nathji summoned him to Mt. Govardhan, where the guru revealed the true identity of the deity and instructed people on the image's proper worship. Despite their sublime genesis, the powers of the divine svarups are linked to two other factors that validate and sustain their potency: 1) their possession or ownership by a Goswami, one of Vallabhacarya's agnatic descendants; and 2) their participation in the periodic rites of refortification (utsavs, literally, festivals) performed by those descendants. Typically at the most important of such rites, an assortment of food offerings is presented to the deity who partakes of them and gains sustenance. The most extraordinary of these feed- ings were performed intermittently when the nine most renowned nidhi- svarups, the nine treasures (nav nidhi), are brought together from various locations throughout western India along with all the Goswamis for a com- bined rite of refortification (mahotsav or great festival). Historically, all nine images have been brought together for the great fes- tivals during periods of political crisis, and the rites serve to promote sectarian solidarity, among other things. The two most famous celebrations occurred in 1738-40 during the political chaos that culminated in Nadir Shah of Persia's sack of Delhi (1739) and again in 1820-21, when the kingdoms of western India, collapsing under pressure from the Marathas, first entered into subsidi- ary alliances with the British (1817-23). The second class of Vallabha statues, those of admitted human manufac- ture, are empowered by virtue of their passage through the hands, at one time or another, of some agnatic descendant of Vallabhacarya who blesses them by bathing them in pamcdmrt (the five nectars of curds, milk, ghee, honey, and sugar) and giving them prasdd (a consecrated food offering) from a previously established svarup. Because the agnatic descendant of Vallabhacarya is instru- mental in bestowing the grace (pusti) of Krishna on these images, they are known as pusti-svarups. Although these statues are svarups, their human fabrication relegates them to a lesser order than the above-described divine nidhi-svarfps.23 Moreover, unlike the divine images remaining in the posses- sion of descendants of Vallabhacarya, the man-made statues eventually may be distributed to lay devotees for worship. The Shri Brijnath image given to Maharao Bhim Singh of Kota in Mathura falls into this category. As with their divine counterparts, the man-made statues must also be refor- 23 On the hierarchy of svaraps, see Bennett (1990:200-4) and Lynch (1988:190).</page><page sequence="20">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 741 tified periodically. These rites can be performed by any class of brahman normally permitted to perform the seva (service) of Vallabha deities.24 How- ever, the refortification rites are considered more efficacious if a male descen- dant of Vallabhacarya, particularly one of the sect's eight principal lineage heads, performs them. In Kota, the Goswami of the Shri Mathuresh Temple was traditionally invited to the Maharao's palace to perform the worship of Shri Brijnath on important festival days, such as Krishna's birth anniversary; and occasionally the head priest of the Shri Nathji Temple in Nathdvara even came to Kota to perform this task (see Plate 4). From the preceding taxonomy of statues one sees that the brahmanical line of Vallabhacarya links both categories of Vallabhite images (divine and man- made) in a duplex circuit of empowerment. As descendants of the sect's founder, the Goswamis maintain the potency of the limited group of divine statues through the performance of refortification rites (just as their posses- sion of the divine svarups validates their status as descendants of Val- labhacarya). In turn, these descendants connect the potency of the divine statues with the unbounded group of man-made ones. To put it simply, the mystical powers of a man-made statue, like Shri Brijnath, are dependent upon the powers of a divine statue ultimately controlled by a descendant of Val- labhacarya. Before examining the implications of this fact for royal legiti- macy, let me comment on one consequence of these entwined loops of em- powerment for sectarian authority. Because the gift to animate statues that comes with descent from Vallabhacarya is a rare and valuable source of authority, the preceptor's recognized descendants have tightly regulated the claims to such ancestry in order to prevent impostors from assuming the saintly mantle. This concern accounts for the proliferation of official pub- lished genealogies about the Vallabha lineage and the practice in Vallabha temples of displaying large cloth hangings with cameo portraits of the ap- proved descendants.25 IV. The Travels of the Nine Treasures and the Legitimation of Kingship in Kota Earlier, in my analysis of Laksman Dan's text, I intimated a paradox between Kota's protection and Maharao Bhim Singh's initiation into the Sampradaya. Although Bhim Singh's conversion endowed him with the tutelary image of Shri Brijnath, it also precipitated Bundi's near ruination of Kota. Presently, I shall explore this dialectic more deeply and consider the ways in which the sect sometimes buttressed and other times undermined dynastic stability. This dual capacity, however, was effected less through the appearance and disap- 24 In addition to the descendants of Vallabhacarya, who are Telegu brahmans, only the Sanchora and Girar subcastes of brahmans are permitted physical contact with the divine svarups (Vaudeville 1980:45; Jindel 1976:179). 25 A number of these temple hangings are reproduced in Skelton (1973).</page><page sequence="21">742 NORBERT PEABODY pearance of Shri Brijnath (as Laksman Dan suggested) than the Goswamis' movement of the nine treasures in to and out of Kota. In showing this, I shall demonstrate that the ritual powers of the Goswamis just discussed were not merely symbolic, lacking real instrumentality. Instead, sectarian authority, through its prerogative to move statues, had consequential agency in legit- imating and delegitimating kingship. From the late seventeenth through mid-nineteenth centuries the Sam- pradaya's nine treasures veritably were the Argonauts of western India. The course of Shri Nathji's voyages, as detailed in the SNPV, presages the travels of other important Vallabha statues. Like the image of Shri Nathji, the nine treasures are said to have remained peaceably in Braj until the reign of Au- rangzeb, when fear of the Muslim other forced the Goswamis to remove each of these svarups to safer locales. Since then each of the nine treasures has migrated extensively, as evidenced by the trail of abandoned temples and memorial shrines that confirm the historicity of these movements. For exam- ple, after leaving Mathura, Shri Dvarkanath was taken to Ahmadabad (1670), Asotiya (late seventeenth century), Kankroli (1720), Udaipur (1802), and again Kankroli (1808) (see Plate 2). The statue of Shri Gokulnath also trav- elled from Mathura during Aurangzeb's reign, first to Banaras, then to Jaipur (late seventeenth century), and finally was returned to Gokul (mid-nineteenth century).26 Similar itineraries may be reconstructed for each divine svarup. Since the sect's beginnings, Kota often has hosted one or another of these travelling images. In addition to legends of Shri Nathji's brief visit in 1670, we know from firmer historical evidence that two other svarups have resided in Kota from time to time. Copperplate inscriptions of land grants given to Shri Mathuresh confirm that the statue was brought to Kota in 1738 after nearly sixty years in the neighboring kingdom of Bundi. Once settled in Kota, Shri Mathuresh has remained unusually sedentary (one recent excursion aside).27 Shri Vitthalnath, the most peripatetic svarup, resided in Kota during the early seventeenth century and again from 1802 to 1822 (interspersed between visits to Khimnor, Udaipur, Kannauj, and Nathdvara); and even today Shri Vitthalnath's vacant temple in Kota remains readied for his hoped- for return. Through the courses of these travels the Goswamis helped legiti- mate or delegitimate the standing of the rulers into or out of whose territories they moved their images. This legitimation was accomplished both by uniting a present king's devotion for one of the nine treasures with the devotion of past exemplary kings who also worshipped the same image and by linking the powers of these divine images more closely with local tutelary deities of less august stature. 26 My principal sources for the travels of the nine treasures are Shastri (1973) and Ambalal (1987). 27 The recent peregrination took place in 1952 when the image was taken to Jatipur in Braj before returning to Kota in 1975. I plan to write specifically about this episode elsewhere.</page><page sequence="22">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 743 Although the divine statues remained in the physical possession of the Goswamis, an important connection between the itineraries of Vallabha im- ages and royal ability to bestow religious patronage deserves further com- ment. Kings were the prominent benefactors for the temples and brahmans, who relied on patronage in order to maintain themselves. Conveniently, the giving of land and money to brahmans and temples was one of the most important shastric duties of the Hindu king (rdjadharma), which additionally increased his personal merit. Records of land grants to religious organizations were permanently etched on copper plates to insure that these endowments were eternal. The capacity for kings to give to temples was itself a function of political stability and military success. A simple corollary of this point is that political weakness lessened such patronage. Thus, it is unsurprising that when the Goswami of the Shri Mathuresh Temple moved his statue to Kota from Bundi in 1738, Bundi's political situation was precarious.28 In 1713 and again in 1719 Kota had sacked Bundi, during which Kota plundered the treasury, dismantled large portions of the palace to be reconstructed at Kota, confis- cated and sold all cattle in the city, and even seized common cooking pots. Soon thereafter Bundi plunged into a civil war in which Kota, Jaipur, and the Marathas supported rival factions. In 1729 Bundi at last became Jaipur's client as the Maharaja of Jaipur successfully installed his pretender on the Bundi throne and exiled the other leading claimant, who had been supported by Kota. Troops from Jaipur were garrisoned at Bundi during the next two dec- ades in order to preserve Jaipur's interests there. By removing Shri Mathuresh from Bundi and its troubles, the Goswami no doubt was influenced by hopes that Kota would provide the greener pastures of political buoyancy and steady patronage. A similar combination of factors were at work in 1802, when Shri Vit- thalnath came to Kota from Nathdvara in neighboring Mewar (Udaipur). This move occurred when Maratha forces were repeatedly plundering Mewar ter- ritory and many of Mewar's clients joined in a general insurrection (Tod 1983: I, 361-2). By the same token, Shri Vitthalnath's return to Nathdvara in 1822 took place shortly after the situation in Kota deteriorated with the outbreak of open civil war there. Significantly, this return coincided with the restoration of stability in Mewar as a result of British military support that, although di- rected more specifically at reducing the Marathas (the East India Company's principal rival in central and western India at the time), benefited Mewar equally (at least in the short run). Such evidence indicates that although kings could not directly possess statues, patronage remained an effective means through which their beneficial presence could be secured indirectly. In this way the travels of the statues retrospectively legitimated political success. At 28 My principal sources here are Sharma (1940), Gupta (1979), and Sarkar (1983).</page><page sequence="23">744 NORBERT PEABODY the same time, a history of such movements to new and shifting centers of power and command also confirmed and intensified the sanctioning effects associated with the statues themselves. However, in looking more closely at the destinations that Goswamis chose for their images, we see that the Goswamis were often not without agency in this whole process as well. For example, the decision of the Goswami of Shri Mathuresh to remove his image from Bundi to Kota in 1738 is curious in two respects. The Goswami did not take his image to Jaipur, Bundi's overlord and occupier; rather, the image was taken to Kota, which was sacked earlier that same year by a Maratha army and reduced to tributary status. By the same token, when Shri Vitthalnath fled Mewar, he did not proceed to one of the emerging Maratha centers of rule as one might expect. Instead Shri Vit- thalnath also traveled to Kota. Hence, unlike the Thai case in which to the victor goes the spoils, the western Indian case was not so simple. The link between travels, patronage, and political attainment did not form a closed, cybernetic loop. Because Goswamis determined the new destinations for their images (choosing from among several possibilities satisfying the minimum conditions of stability), they were instrumental in determining who would receive propitious influences radiating from their statues. In Part Two I shall suggest how the Goswamis' instrumentality might be conjoined with the interests of merchants, in opposition to kings, but let me mention here just one feature of temple land tenure that underwrote the Gos- wamis' agency. Each of the nine treasures had landholdings that were widely dispersed across many rival kingdoms and from which they derived rental income. For example, aside from its landholdings in Mewar, the Shri Nathji Temple had large estates in Partabgarh, Kota, Karauli, Bharatpur, and Baroda (Richardson 1979:76). The Shri Mathuresh Temple in Kota simultaneously held land in several of the kingdoms in southern Rajasthan and Malwa, while other svarups located in foreign kingdoms had estates in Kota (Das 1896:7- 8). The cumulative effect of such endowments was that no king fully con- trolled the temple's purse strings of those temples and through them the distribution of sacred allocations. Thus although Hindu rulers attempted to influence the movement of statues and secure their beneficial presence through patronage, this expenditure did not necessarily translate into a simple guarantee of control over images because the Goswamis drew income from several competing sources. If I may irreverently invoke Marx, Hindu kings did not constitute a dominant class fur sich, and the Sampradaya easily ex- ploited rivalries between kings in order to exert leverage against the individual rajas with whom it dealt. Richardson (1979) details how, with the slow de- cline of Mewar's power during the course of the eighteenth century, the Shri Nathji Temple at Nathdvara gradually asserted greater control over all aspects of the villages under its control including not only rents and trade (transit</page><page sequence="24">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 745 duties, fees from public markets, duties on precious metals, gate fees, and so forth) but also the judiciary. With this understanding of the dialectic between the sect's dependence on patronage from royal sources and the sect's ability to play one source off against another, the logic behind the installation of Shri Brijnath, instead of Shri Mathuresh, as Kota's tutelary deity should now be clear. The Kota Ma- haraos directly controlled the Shri Brijnath svarup whereas their authority over the Shri Mathuresh svarup was mediated by the brahmanical line of Vallabhacarya. This difference is spatially manifest in the physical placement of their temples in Kota: one in the Maharao's palace and the other in the bazaar. The Kota rulers pegged their legitimacy in the long run to Shri Bri- jnath but buttressed that legitimacy with one of the nine treasures when they could.29 Similarly, in Mewar Shri Nathji remained at Nathdvara, forty kilo- meters from the capital, Udaipur. Mewar also remained formally dedicated to the deity Eklingji long after Shri Nathji's arrival within the kingdom's territory and despite an immense popularity of Shri Nathji that dwarfed that of Eklingji (see also Richardson 1979). In order to profit from Shri Nathji's beneficial presence, the rulers of Mewar became personal devotees of Shri Nathji and altered the worship of Shaivite Eklingji to conform to the distinctive forms of Vallabhite worship, such as having fixed timings for darsans when the deity may be viewed, adjusting the worship of the image to reflect seasonal cycles of weather and holidays, and so on. These findings have significant implications for the debate concerning so- cial hierarchy in South Asia. Recently it has become fashionable to belittle Dumont's (1980) formulation of the Indian social order based on the hier- archical opposition of purity and pollution. The priestly order, as the highest embodiment of purity, enjoys an apotheosis, and royalty is sanctioned through its encompassment by-and submission to-the brahman. No doubt, Du- mont's portrayal of the division between brahman and king in terms of an absolute separation between sacred (religious) and profane (political) do- mains is unsustainable, an argument forcefully made by Marglin (1985), Shulman (1985), Dirks (1987), Raheja (1988), and Inden (1990), among many others.30 This does not mean, however, that Dumont's entire notion of encompassment must be rejected out of hand. The writing of Nicholas Dirks (1987; see also 1979, 1989) on the Tamil "little kingdom" of Pudukkottai is symptomatic in this regard because it explicitly claims to replace the Dumontian formulation with a construction of social hierarchy centered on the king. Building upon Sahlins's (1972) famous 29 We also may speculate that, in adopting for Sri Brijnath the rhetoric of travels that is normally applied to the nine treasures, Laksman Dan was perhaps trying to inflate the powers associated with the Kota tutelary deity and, thereby, the kingly claims of the Kota ruling line. 30 If this indeed is the full implication of what Dumont has argued.</page><page sequence="25">746 NORBERT PEABODY suggestion that "chiefly pooling and redistribution" of goods establishes a ranked centricity within social groups, Dirks argues that redistribution of land, honours, and service tenures was a fundamental royal activity whose performance constituted Hindu kingship and, hence, the Hindu polity. This view rests on a cultural logic that affirms the king's divinity and in which the king's gift to his political clients represented the sharing of a portion of his munificent, celestial persona. On the flip side of the coin, clients who accept- ed the royal gift established their graded incorporation into the whole polity symbolized by the king at its center. Dirks (1987:129) explains how this could generate in an alternative form of hierarchy: The substance of the gift-the land rights, the titles, emblems, honors, and privilege of service, usufruct and command-was the partial sovereign substance of the king. All those who were given (and who accepted) gifts became part of the whole king, and by implication the king's realm, the kingdom. Participation in the whole was not, however, unranked, for the differential nature and contingent character of all these entitlements provided the basis for the creation of a political hierarchy. . . . Ultimate- ly, entitlements by their very nature constituted hierarchy through a logic of variable proximity to the king, to sovereignty itself. Hence for Dirks, the king-and not the brahman-unequivocally becomes central to an understanding of the social order, and the brahmanical construc- tion of caste is dismissed as either a wishful fiction by a marginal group or, worse, an artifact of a colonialism that detached caste from politics and allowed the brahmanical order (with British help) to reconstitute it in a disem- bodied, apolitical matrix.31 Evidence of the royal gift appears in Kota as well. Laksman Dan's account of the visit to Delhi by Maharao Bhim Singh of Kota in order to receive honours from the Mughal Emperor resonates favorably with this cultural logic. While not denying its validity, however, I have argued here that the logic of the royal gift is opposed by another. Laksman Dan's chronicle of Kota betrays this alternate logic even if its deeper significance has been masked somewhat to suit the interests and projects of his royal patron. If, as Dirks (1989:60) claims, "temples are key institutions in the formation of social communities" from which "kings derive much of their power" and through which kings "bestow their emblems and privileges," then the case of the Vallabha Sampradaya's statues is significant because it testifies to the degree to which the priestly order could actualize a competing claim to primacy in the system of social organization (even before the advent of the colonial era). As indicated by the legitimating movements of Vallabha svarups into and out of Hindu kingdoms, such a brahmanical perspective is not an irrelevant textual fantasy, but under certain conditions it can have very real consequences for the 31 This is not to argue that colonialism did not affect the caste system, only that colonialism affected caste in a slightly different way than envisioned by Dirks. But this is a story for another occasion.</page><page sequence="26">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 747 Hindu polity. Furthermore, the unambiguously ranked subordination that Dirks claims is entailed in acceptance of the royal gift is clouded by the fact that the Goswamis simultaneously derived patronage from a number of rival kings and that the Goswamis returned these gifts with prestations of their own (the most important of which being the propitious presence of the deity itself), so that it is a contested matter as to both who was subordinating whom and what the gift fundamentally meant.32 This suggestion, on the other hand, does not mean that the royal caste uncritically accepted the brahmanical position but argues that the brahmanical construction had to be contended with and taken seriously. Hindu kings, and for that matter merchants and agriculturalists, all advanced rival constructions of the principles underlying the social order. Often these constructions em- ployed the same constellation of cultural categories while the relative impor- tance of each of the categories was differentially weighed according to more self-interested concerns. Malamoud's (1981) masterful discussion of "revolv- ing hierarchies" offers an example of how this could be accomplished with the systematic interrelationships between the three purusarthas (Hindu aims of life). These aims are dharma (the maintenance of morality, duty, or order), artha (the pursuit of power and wealth), and kama (the desire for pleasure). Traditionally dharma has been assigned as the aim most appropriate to the brahman and artha as the aim of the (ksatriya) warrior-king. Malamoud notices that the classical commentators on each purusartha present the aim in which they specialize both as a constituent member of the three purusarthas in a narrow technical sense and as the explanatory foundation for (or root of) the other two in a more general sense. Thus, by sliding between these two levels of meaning, each purusartha "in its turn becomes an element of the whole and, simultaneously, the encompassing 'instance' of that whole" (Malamoud 1981:45). Two conclusions can be drawn from an application of Malamoud's revolv- ing hierarchies to the priest-king relationship in South Asia. First, instead of attempting to impose a fixed view of Indian society that claims a privileged status, such a formulation suggests that a more contextual construction is appropriate-one that would be more responsive to the inherent paradoxes and ambiguities in the multiple meanings of social and political relations. Framing the problem of analysis in this way, of course, makes it necessary to place one's investigation firmly within historical processes (both recurring and exceptional) in order to account for how each of these constructions are brought to the fore, played out, and then displaced to the background. Sec- ond, just as the royal order is not defined by an exclusive interest in the 32 Other priestly gifts include initiation into the Sampradaya and as well as more casual forms of blessings. Moreover, Goswamis also were important agents in the distribution of prasdd (consecrated food offerings) and temple honours, such as turban bands that previously had adorned the deity, even if these gifts themselves "came from the deity."</page><page sequence="27">748 NORBERT PEABODY political economy (as correctly argued by Dirks and others), the priestly order is not defined by a narrow concern with the divine (that is, religion as com- monly understood in the West). Rather, the two orders both conjoin what in Occidental thought are separated into religion, politics, and economics. The difference between these groups, then, lies in the way in which they combine these analytic domains, resulting in the distinctive social orientations whose effects are charted on these pages. PART TWO Until now I have only discussed the mechanisms and dynamics whereby a history of political attainment could be accumulated in important Vallabha statuary such that they become veritable repositories of power and legitimacy for which kings vied. In the remaining portion of this article, I shall explore how events could also leave a negative imprint on these images as well. Such events were capable of depleting these repositories, and the images could lose their powers. As mentioned in my introduction, although Tambiah is keenly aware of the processes whereby sacred objects may be drained of their poten- cy when they are placed in a commodity context, he does not account for the occurrence of this same phenomenon when such objects are secluded from exchange. Here I shall argue that the cultural deconstruction of value is not solely the result of the forces of market exchange but also could be rooted in other socially constituted phenomena. In order to accomplish this task, I must first make an additional point about the joint rites of refortification (mahotsavs). These collective rites ostensively imbue the sect's nine treasures with power, resulting in the linkage of one treasure's status to its mutual recognition by the Goswamis affiliated with the other treasures such that this status would be jeopardized if recognition were withheld. This in fact happened to Shri Balkrishna, the treasure that Vit- thalnath originally gave to his sixth son, Yadunath (see Plate 3). The Case of Shri Balkrishna and Shri Mukandrai Although Shri Balkrishna was regarded as one of the original nine treasures, his status in the sect is now disputed. Coincidental with Balkrishna's fall from grace has been the rise of Shri Mukandrai, and today, many Pustimargis name Mukandrai (and not Balkrishna) as one of the nine treasures. Balkrishna's troubles date back to the great refortification festival of 1738-40, which he could not attend because political unrest in Gujarat made it impossible for him to travel to Nathdvara. Again in 1821, Balkrishna was unable to attend the mahotsav, this time because two descendants of Yadunath had a dispute over who was the rightful heir to the lineage's leadership. Unable or unwilling to settle the dispute, the other Goswamis excluded Shri Balkrishna from the festival, and Shri Mukandrai, who until that point had been a minor deity in the temple of Shri Nathji, was substituted in Balkrishna's stead.</page><page sequence="28">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 749 To complicate matters, the pretender to Yadunath's holy position, who did not possess the image of Balkrishna, obtained the image of Mukandrai in 1829 from the widow of the late Goswami of the Shri Nathji Temple (Ambalal 1987:59).33 This Goswami then took Shri Mukandrai to Banaras, where the image was installed in a new temple. As a result two Goswamis, one in Surat with Balkrishna and the other in Banaras with Mukandrai, claimed to be Yadunath's legitimate heir and to possess his treasure.34 This split remains today. By the mid-nineteenth century the reputation of Shri Balkrishna was trapped in a full-fledged downward spiral. In 1862 the Goswami of the Shri Balkrishna Temple became embroiled with one of his devotees in a notorious libel suit that resulted in the Goswami's appearance in British courts in Bom- bay ([Mulji] 1865). The Goswami's subjugation to the colonial legal system's imperatives further undermined his authority and provided yet another signal of the decreasing potency of Shri Balkrishna's image. Shri Balkrishna's de- clining status was most recently confirmed during the great festival of refor- tification held in 1966, in which Shri Mukandrai again participated and Shri Balkrishna remained absent. The potency of Vallabha images thus may be graded by observing the rise and fall of their rank in the culturally constructed hierarchy of progressively more exclusive categories: that is, the svarup as opposed to murti, the divine nidhi-svarup as opposed to man-made pusti-svarup, or the nav nidhi (as opposed to all other images).35 Although the Goswamis may initially set this status, it is also ascribed by the devotees, whose choice of preferred pil- grimage destinations determines which pilgrimage sites become the foci of popular cults among a plethora of competing centers. Thus these statues possess a value graded in part by members of the sect (for example, Shri Mathuresh popularly is considered to be a more potent image than Shri Brijnath or even Shri Balkrishna). The determination of this valuation, which may fluctuate over time, surprisingly does not occur in a context of exchange. These images always remain in the possession of the descendants of Val- labhacarya, who do not trade or exchange them. To borrow Kopytoff's termi- nology (1986:73-76), these objects are "terminal commodities" removed from the normal sphere of commodity exchange. This prevents the images 33 In 1826 the Goswami of the Shri Nathji Temple (depicted in Plates 1 and 4) died without male heir. For several years while it was being decided who would succeed him, the widow of the late Goswami assumed a powerful role in the Sampradaya. 34 The elevation of Shri Mukandrai to the status of nau nidhi was effected through the intermediary and more open-ended category of nidhi-svarip, the thirty-odd self-manifest images said to have been discovered during the lifetime of Vallabhacarya and after. Bennett (1990:202-3) also details examples of how the biographies of statues can be constructed by their devotees in order to establish their pedigree as nidhi-svarups. 35 Within the category of the nav nidhi the images may be further graded according to the affiliated Goswami's seniority of descent from Vallabhacarya.</page><page sequence="29">750 NORBERT PEABODY from direct gradation in terms of money or some other counter of value (unlike Tambiah's Thai amulets).36 However, as opposed to Kopytoff's "val- ueless" terminal commodities, which are either priceless (such as heirlooms of sentimental importance) or worthless (such as objects for which there is no demand), the Vallabha statues are continuously graded, evaluated, and ranked vis-a-vis each other, and the outcomes of these rankings are contested and in flux. This is not to assert, however, that the rise and fall of the Vallabha images' status is completely disconnected from the forces of exchange. The following section will show that although the images themselves may not be directly involved in exchange, the exchange occurring around them in the bazaar has indirect implications for establishing their potency. The Economy of Pilgrimage and the Potency of Statues Earlier in this article, I addressed the importance of royal patronage for attracting the famous divine images (particularly the nine treasures). We saw that the most enduring source of income for Vallabha temples derived from tax-free gifts of agricultural estates and urban rental properties by Hindu rajas. However, patronage also came in the form of consumable wealth (cash and jewelry) from pilgrims and local merchants.37 Although Hindu rajas used land endowments to entice into their kingdoms the Vallabha Goswamis and their divine statues, these divine statues typically were installed in the bazaar once they arrived. Cities fortunate enough to be the home of famous Vallabha deities became, and still are, important centers of pilgrimage. The pilgrimage economy involved the temple in two interrelated ways. First, pilgrims came to the temple to offer their money to the god and thus injected financial assets directly into the temple. Second, while pilgrims visited the temple, they also spent money in the bazaar on other goods and services offered by merchants. Jindel (1976) has amply documented the importance of pilgrim traffic to the economy at Nathdvara, a sentiment echoed for the Shri Mathuresh Temple and Kota's bazaar (Mehta 1972). Booming business in the bazaar, in turn, allowed merchants to plow greater sums into the temple's coffers. These gifts added to the renown of the deity, for it allowed the temple priests to perform ever more elaborate and costly rituals that were indexical of the deity's increasing status and power.38 This lavish magnificence of worship in Vallabha temples has been one of the Sampradaya's distinguishing features (Bennett 1990:182-3). At the same time, increased commercial traffic in the bazaar also benefitted 36 Nor does it cost any more to worship Shri Nathji than Shri Brijnath, so it is not possible to make comparisons of their relative worth through intermediary equivalences of the cost of their "service." 37 As temples did not practice usury, this wealth did not generate income in the same way property did. 38 Tambiah (1985:157), adapting Burks's notion of indexical symbol, defines indexical fea- tures as those that "directly show how interpersonal aspects of rank and privilege are validated and enacted by the symbolism and requirements of the ritual itself." Thus the scale, magnifi- cence, and splendor of certain Vallabha rites entailed a financial outlay that barred poorer temples (with presumably less potent images) from performing them.</page><page sequence="30">CHARISMA, OBJECT FETISHISM IN HINDU KOTA 751 the king, for customs duties and transit dues on imported goods were a second major source of royal revenue, along with agricultural taxes. In sum, the dynamics of a healthy pilgrimage economy bound the mutual interests of king, temple, and merchants. This dynamic helps account for the reason why the Hindu rajas of western India first devoted themselves to the Vallabha cause in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. With the decline of the Mughal Empire during this period, Hindu kings could no longer rely on the external support of the paramount power to uphold their rule. But through their conversion to the Vallabha Sampradaya, the rajas united royal interests with those of the wealthy merchant (vaisya) community, by far the strongest adherents to the Sampradaya, and forged a king-merchant alliance in which income from trade sustained and strengthened royal political power. As Bayly (1983:14- 15) has also argued, the income from mercantile sources enabled the eight- eenth-century rajas to raise standing mercenary armies held firmly in their employ. The professional army freed the rajas from their reliance on preben- dal levies whose services were acquired in exchange for revenue estates and whose loyalties were notoriously divided between allegiance to the raja and the desire to create their own local, independent bases of power. However, there is also a down side to the dynamic uniting the king, temple, and merchant. When economic conditions in the bazaar were weak, perhaps as a result of a disruption in pilgrimage due to political instability, then the donations to the temple decreased, which was immediately reflected in abridging or eliminating the costly rituals performed for the deity. This, in turn, adversely affected the reputation of the deity leading to a further reduc- tion of pilgrimage. A significant drop-off in pilgrimage, then, undermined the bazaar economy so that temple donations from the local merchant community would also decline and so on. Eventually this downward economic spiral would result in the statue's removal to another kingdom (as in the case of Shri Mathuresh in 1738) or, if that were not possible, the perceived loss of the statue's potency (as in the case of Shri Balkrishna). Such a crisis would create a divergence of interests between the king, the temple, and the bazaar, as the Goswami would be tempted to move the image to another kingdom, causing the merchants to support those rival claimants to the throne who could estab- lish a more conducive pilgrimage economy that would permit the image to remain sedentary. Alternatively, because the interests of merchant family corporations typically spanned several kingdoms, traders could also encour- age the Goswami to move the image to the domain of a rival king in which other business investments were already in place.39 Such mercantile tran- sience was enhanced further by the easy mobility of the tools of their trade (capital, credit, and expertise). Finally, to bring this analysis full circle, it is 39 See Spodek (1974) for the political implications of the transnational aspects of business interests in Gujarat during the late eighteenth century.</page><page sequence="31">752 NORBERT PEABODY worth noting that Laksman Dan's text also betrays the role of the merchant in this process. During Shri Brijnath's five-year exile in "Muslim" Hyderabad, the potency of Kota's tutelary deity was preserved by a Hindu merchant through his sponsorship of the deity's costly worship. Both parts of this article have thus suggested, in one form or another, that the complex patterning of social hierarchy in India was not the result of a systematic cultural logic that was cyberetically integrated and internally consistent. Instead, South Asian hierarchy possessed multivalent meanings that produced certain ambiguities and contradictions whose tensions became the basis for dissent among various groups with distinctive interests and orientations. These aims, though linked through important channels, were neither homogenized nor entirely reducible one to another. While the diversity of these orientations was enshrined in the ideological differentiation of castes and caste roles, the nonterritorial organization of priestly and merchant groups prevented their autonomy from being subsumed instrumentally under royal control over land. Moreover, in the prevailing precolonial environment of perennial warfare among rival rajas, paramount powers, and prebendal clients in which the technologies of state control were relatively underdeveloped and in which kings often competedfor and depended upon the support of nonwar- rior groups, the primacy of the royal construction of hierarchy was not irre- futable. Given this complexity on the ground, the multiple and contested meaning of hierarchy in the precolonial state remained a prominent feature of the social landscape. REFERENCES Ambalal, Amit. 1987.
