After all, this oriental imagination was even tually found to be true. It is probably appropriate that the dogma, about the inability of plants to behave, be broken by the oriental biologists as their life and culture is based more deeply in a past that had acknowledged the life of plants and animals with equal respect. In the tradition of Bose, we wish that biologists begin treating plants worthy of behavioural studies and also wish that the term 'Ethology' encompasses both plants and animals. 1. Bell, P.
