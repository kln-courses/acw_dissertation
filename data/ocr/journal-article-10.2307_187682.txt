The main concern of the authors is to challenge the view that entropy is a measure of our lack of knowledge about a physical system. They want to establish the objectivity of thermodynamic entropy and to clearly distinguish it from statistical entropy, especially the "entropy" and "negentropy" of information theory. Objectivity of a physical property is not equivalent to the measured value of a property where the latter depends on our state of knowledge in a way the property itself does not. It is suggested that "the entropy of the data" is a better expression than "the entropy of the physical system" since it reflects both the objective, observable character of entropy and the fact that it is relative to the observer's data. For example, calculations of ther- modynamic entropy based on data that do not include information about the presence of isotopes as part of the composition variables of a system might not agree well with ex- perimental results. The "entropy of the data" will not give good measured values of the "entropy of the physical system." But just because measured values are subject to revision, it does not follow that they are subjective or anthropomorphic in some profound sense. There is no general connection between lack of data or information and a larger value of entropy; getting more data (for example, that hydrogen has ortho and para forms) allows us to correct our calculations but that may raise or lower the calculated value of entropy. Chapter 2 addresses the question, "Is entropy subjective in statistical mechanics?" The authors give a brief review of quantum mechanics and note that some theorists hold that the observer or knowing subject is not fully separable from the measuring set-up, citing the nonuniqueness of state vectors as support. However, in applications of quantum me- chanics to statistical mechanics only probabilities of eigenstates and eigenvalues are used, and these have determinate values. The statistical aspects of quantum statistical mechanics arise from the axiomatic structure of quantum mechanics and the essential incompleteness of the thermodynamic type of specification of a system. There is no "subjectivity" here. Section 2.3 is a nice discussion of the assumptions of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The ergodic approach is mentioned and put aside in favor of the classical approach of Gibbs, later adapted by Fowler and Tolman to the quantum situation. The focus is on the equal probability of accessible energy eigenstates at equilibrium, and the question is whether there is any taint of subjectivity here. This leads to a brief consideration of subjective, relative frequency and propensity interpretations of probability. Ultimately, the justification for supposing equally probable eigenstates is said to be heuristic. The essential point of the chapter is the demonstration that SG, the Gibbs entropy, is a satisfactory entropy analog for equilibrium states and that, in the case of reversible process, SG can be equated to the change in thermodynamic entropy without appealing to "igno- rance" or "lack of information." The authors conclude that entropy has a fully objective status yet note that it is a peculiar sort of physical property. Only entropy differences can be obtained and only along a reversible route. Entropy is not observable in any obvious</page><page sequence="2">452 BOOK REVIEWS sense but it does not manifest itself as an extremely measurable heat effect under certain conditions. The Denbighs appeal to the notion of a dispositional property to characterize entropy; just as the fragility of glass is not observable but only manifests itself under certain circumstances, so too the dispositional property, entropy. Chapter 3 continues the rooting out of subjectivity and cites Gibbs for originating the distinctively subjective approach with his method of coarse-graining. The authors ask whether coarse-graining is really subjective, whether it is an essential technique for the discussion of irreversibility, and whether a coarse-grained entropy is primarily an artifact of the H- theorem. There are tantalizing remarks here about irreversibility: the 'problem of irrever- sibility' is not so much a matter of understanding entropy increases-for this is fairly clear at the intuitive level-as of legitimising our intuition within a theoretical system which is self consistent" (p.57), and "Even though complete isolation may be impossible to attain, it would seem wrong to suppose that macroscopic irreversibility would not occur if it were attained" (p. 57). But the reader is left hanging; there is no systematic discussion of kinds of irreversibility. Given the remark at the end of the book (p. 118), that irreversibility is more fundamental than entropy, this is somewhat puzzling. A detailed analysis of a slow chemical reaction in a homogeneous gas or liquid system is used to show by counter- example that coarse-graining is not necessary to the treatment of irreversibility. Chapter 4 traces the shift from the nineteenth-century view that atomic particles, even of the same kind, can be individuated to the modern view that such particles are indistin- guishable. Gibbs's entropy of mixing paradox and the nonadditive entropies of statistical mechanics were catalysts for the process that led to philosophical consideration of concepts such as identity and indistinguishability. The Denbighs want to dispel any notion that dis- tinguishability is a subjective matter. In a clear presentation and elegant resolution of Gibbs's paradox, they appeal to the dispositional property of entropy as well as to its nonconser- vation (except in idealized circumstances) to show that the discontinuity of the paradox could only be made manifest at the limit of an infinite number of reversible stages. In any one of the sequence of reversible stages, the entropy change varies continuously with the distinguishability of components in that stage, and this distinguishability is an objective property of the components of the system. The Gibbs's discontinuity is an artifact and does not correspond to anything actually observable. As to how macroscopic distinguishability can arise from microscopic indistinguishabil- ity, the authors build up large bodies from indistinguishable parts to show how physically and chemically distinguishable structures proliferate as large molecules are constructed from elements. Having examined kinds of statistical entropy in relation to thermodynamic entropy, the Denbighs turn to a consideration of "information entropy." While acknowledging its heu- ristic value, they advise caution and remind us that any entropy used as a surrogate for thermodynamic entropy must share its fully objective character. Information theory is said to be based on a subjective interpretation of probability that is more general than the ob- jective interpretation; and thus, information theory is more comprehensive than statistical mechanics. However, in physico-chemical contexts, information entropy is a meaningful concept only if it can be shown to be identical with an item of thermodynamic entropy. We should not appeal to subjective interpretations when fully objective ones are available, and thermodynamical entropy does not inherit subjectivity, because an information entropy can be defined in such a way that they seem to be brothers. The book has many virtues. It is clearly written and tells a compelling story about trans- ference of ideas from "randomness" to "lack of knowledge" to "subjectivity." It shows how careful we must be in using concepts in domains far from their birthplace. It is not strong on ontology and epistemology; and the reader is teased with remarks about subjec- tive and objective interpretations of probability, conjectural and convergent scientific re- alism, and objective reference. But at least the authors have tied their philosophical po- sition to an actual controversy in science, something philosophers of science caught up in sterile debates about scientific realism might note as well.
