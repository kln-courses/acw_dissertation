<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Amrtaghatesvara Temple in Tamil Nadu A Complex Example of Cola Architecture by TlZIANA LORENZETTI The Structure On the road that crosses Tamil Nadu from Cidambaram southwards, at about thirty kilometres from the city of Siva Natar?ja, a muddy pathway cuts sharp away from the main thoroughfare, plunging into the thick vegetation. Eventually it runs through the village of Melakkadambur (in the South Arcot District) to peter out in an orderly clearing. Here abruptly appears a sturdy enclosure wall, within which rises up the interesting Amrtaghatesvara temple i1) dedicated to Siva and belonging to the late C?la period (1070-1270 A.D.). The temple is aligned on an east-west axis and faces east (Fig. 1). A single gopura with two projecting levels, as is usual retaining the form of a truncated pyramid and crowned with s?l?, pavilion with a barrel shape roof (Fig. 2), leads into the sacred area where the temple rises. Extraordinarily, it conserves intact its ancient splendour since, although still in use, it seems largely to have escaped the gaudy refurbishing one might normally expect (Fig. 3). Of modest proportions, Amrtaghatesvara temple is not completely unknown, having been generally described by S.R. Balasubrahmanyam (1963: 47-55; see also Meister &amp; Dhaky 1983,1: 296-98), but no specific study has been dedicated to it. Clearly quite ancient in its original core, it can be dated to the times of the Saiva saint Appar (2) (around 7th century A.D.). However, it seems that hardly anything remains of the original sanctuary, celebrated in the hymns of Appar with the name of Karakk?yil, the present edifice - as an inscription in old Tamil language tells us (Balasubrahmanyam 1979: 119) - being a reconstruction made in the late C?la period, during the reign of the sovereign Kul?ttunga I (1070-1122 A.D.). The entire sanctuary, surrounded by an enclosure wall (pr?k?ra), on whose east and west side runs a covered arcade, consists of the following structures: (*) According to local traditions, Indra is said to have worshipped the Lord (Siva) here and so obtained the nectar {amrta) of immortality: hence the temple is called Amrtaghatesvara (cf. Balasubrahmanyam 1979: 119). (2) Appar, who most probably lived between the end of 6 th and beginning of the 7th century, was one of the major of the sixty-three masters of Tamil Saivism (N?yanm?r).

This is the core of the ancient temple, since the ardhamandapa, the antar?la and the pr?k?ra belong to later times, may be to the N?yaka period. We know, in fact, that the N?yakas of Tamil Nadu used to add many auxiliary structures (among these, large mandapas first of all) to the central nucleus of pre-existing temples (for further details, see Das 1991: 70-76, 108-17, 194-99, 259-62; Michell 2003: 58-113). In this regard it is interesting to note that, rising about one kilometre eastwards from the Amrtaghatesvara, there is another temple Amrtaghate svara's 'twin' in many aspects, but now ruined and overgrown. This temple, in fact, named Rudragodisvara, belongs to the same period (late C?la) and shows similar architectonic structures, details and sculptures (Figs. 7-8). Probably in the late C?la period the entire area was a pilgrimage centre linked to the cult of Siva. But the most [5]</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 5 - Amrtaghatesvara temple, porch on the southern side of the antar?la. (Photo by the Authoress). interesting aspect is that Rudragodisvara is completely lacking in later additions; most probably because by the time of the N?yakas, it had already fallen into disuse. Now, turning back to the Amrtaghatesvara, all the temple rises on a tall socle (upapltha), along which are placed four large wheels of sculpted stone since the sanctuary was conceived in terms of a processional chariot (ratha). Actually, the chariot-temples, combining the choreographic impressions of processional chariots with architectural effects, seem to have been a creation of 12th-century Tamil territory, although there may have been a precursor in Karnataka (Balasubrahmanyam 1979: 125-71). However, the Amrtaghatesvara temple is probably the first example in Tamil Nadu of this type, and it also shows a peculiar feature, the stone wheels being attached to the northern and southern sides of the vim?na, and not - as is usual - at the sides of the mandapa (or, as in this case, the antar?la) preceding the vim?na itself (Lefevre 2005: 528). Upon the upapitha is set the base or plinth {adhisthana) consisting - as is usual - of a rhythmic bands of superimposed horizontal mouldings. From the bottom to top we 190 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 6 - Amrtaghatesvara temple, sikhara. (Photo by the Authoress). Fig. 7 - Rudragodisvara temple.

(Photo by the Authoress). find up?na (foundation moulding), jagati, a ribbed kumuda (which recalls the ribbed eaves of the roof) and kantha, decorated with litde panels of bas-relieves and projecting y?lis (or vyala, a sort of leogryphon) with readers marking each corner (Fig. 9). Over kantha cames pattik? and over this one, appears a recessed moulding {gala?) (5) containing (like in the early C?lukya architecture) miniature friezes of figure sculpture. On the top, a continuous projected eave (parapet kapota), representing the foot of the outer wall, surmounts all the mouldings. As regard to exterior walls, we note that the surface of the antar?la is scantily decorated: only along the southern side - as we have already indicated - takes place a porch. On the contrary, the surface of the outer wall of the vim?na is completely covered with beautifully detailed half-columns of composite structure, well-wrought sculptures and pilastered niches {devakostha), flanked by rearing y?lh containing the best known iconographies of the Hindu pantheon (Fig. 10). Some of these sculp? tures display on the base an inscription in Tamil and Grantha characters (6) indicating the name of the divinity. Three main niches, each showing a small porch before supported by slender eighteen-sided section columns, showing cushion-type capitals and resting on seated lions - very similar indeed to those of the first Pallava art - are set one on each side of the vim?na (Fig. 3). Adjacent to the northern and southern (5) Meister &amp; Dhaky (1983, I: 296) refer to this element as vidi (railing), but I am not sure about this interpretation. (6) The term grantha refers to the script with which Tamil culture transcribes Sanskrit. 192 [8]</page><page sequence="9">sides, there are two more niches, en? dowed as well with a porch supported by columns with seated lions, but small? er and not projecting so prominently forward. It is worth noting that couchant lions, in the early Pallava art probable symbols of renascent but quiescent power, later, with the affirmation of the dynasty (early 8th century), were depicted as rearing, symbols of rampant spiritual and royal power (Soundara Rajan 1978: 75). In the C?la period, the rearing yalh (at times seated) that adorn the base of pillars or the lower tiers of the vim?na wall - certainly derived from the Pallava heritage - could reveal a similar symbolic meaning. As far as the three main niches are concerned, they show a specific icono graphic programme since they contain, in succession, sculptures of Brahma (to the north), Visnu (to the west) and Daksin?m?rti (to the south). The three divinities, aligned with the three cardinal points beginning with the central lihga which occupies the garbhagrha, represent the image of the threefold potential of the one divine energy which flows from ^^^^^Hwf. ^^^^^ --'SP* ^^^b ^T** m tilt i vAm Jt Fig. 10 - Amrtaghatesvara temple, Siva and Devi on the exterior wall of the vim?na. (Photo by the Authoress). the centre towards all directions, manifesting itself in the different functions of emanation, conservation and destruction. The latter is attributed to Siva Daksin?m?rti, the ascetic and great master who, at the end of every kalpa, reabsorbs the entire universe into himself. Each divinity is also shown on the two higher storeys of the vim?na. On the first level the image, likewise placed between two columns in a niche, is surrounded by a broad horse-shoe shaped arch {k?du), formed by plant volutes emerging from the jaws of the kirtitnukha - also defined as k?lamukha - a monstrous face (a mixture of a lion and a dragon), that was to enjoy great popularity not only in India, but also in the figurative art of South-East Asia (Fig. 6). Generally placed at the top of the arches of the gates and niches of temples, the kirtimukha appears a composite, ambiguous form, as indeed accords with its significance (for further details, see Guenon 1946: 36-52; 1987: 23; Filippi 1978; Ghosh 1993). All the mural sculptures belong to the late C?la period, but some influence from eastern C?lukya as well as early P?ndya can be seen. In fact, the highly naturalistic [9] 193</page><page sequence="10">relaxed posture, the strong sense of volume, the liveliness of those figures and also the proportions of the body, with the round torso and the heavy head, recall some eastern C?lukya and early P?ndya sculptures. The extraordinary dynamic quality of these sculptures, alternating in the low and high relief, and depicted of various proportions, seems to be quickened by an inner tension and to be guiding the observer along the entire circumambulation of the monument. They are really connected to the architectural structures, where the upward rising elements, relating to the metaphysical plane, contrast with the horizontal elements, which, growing out in multiple projections and recessed planes, suggest at the same time the expansion and the dissolution of the manifestation. In this regard, it is worth noting that the three main niches, set on each side of the vim?na, convey a great sense of expansion towards the cardinal directions, stressing once again the progression forward of the manifestation. Thus, we have the eternal contraposition between the transcendent and the multitude of undefined degrees of existence, both fused in an organic, dynamic architectural vision in which, as is so often the case in Indian art, the sculpture also combines wonderfully with the architecture and enters into the symbolic significance of the whole. The profound dynamism which pervades the entire complex, measured out in a timeless rhythm, is also accentuated by the wheels sculpted along the upapitha. Above the outer walls, the Amrtaghatesvara shows a flat roof surrounded by projecting ribbed eaves (kapota), and covering most of the temple with the exception of the vim?na that rises above, surrounded at the cardinal points by four architectural elements whose volumes echo its form in miniature. Two octagonal storeys (tala), separated by a ribbed kapota, lead up to the heavenward leap of the sikhara, the element at the top of the structure, whose circular shape and the accentuated flange of rim are typical of many late C?la temples. Contrary to the late dr?vida temples, whose storeys of the vim?na are characterised by a chain of miniature shrines (usually referred to by the Graeco Roman term aediculae), the talas of the Amrtaghatesvara temple lack in such elements. Particularly the second storey is richly adorned with images of divinities and various decorative motives, sculpted of various proportions and on different planes of depth. In this way these figures, emerging in their varied ways from the background, are partially hidden from the viewer's perspective from below, giving the impression of being living persons inhabiting the roof of the temple. The same device can be seen in some early P?ndya works: in particular the composition carved on the roof of the cave temple of Vattuv?nk?vil (Kallugumalai) in Tamil Nadu can be mentioned (Fig. 11) (7). The above sikhara of the Amrtaghatesvara is supported by a cylindrical (7) Though no foundation records exist on this monolith, on the base of some inscriptions found in the group of Jain carvings on the same hill, the monument has been dated between the 7th and the 8th century A.D. (Soundara Rajan 1978: 93-94). 194 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 11 - Vattuv?nk?vil cave temple (Kallugumalai), detail of the vim?na.

(Drawing by the Authoress). collar (griv?) and surmounted by a vase shaped element (kumbha), a lotus flower (padma, idal in Tamil) and a modern metal rod whose gilded tip shines by night in a beam of artificial light. The combination of the square plan vim?na, its octagonal storeys, the cylin? drical griv? and the circular sikhara is very interesting and quite unusual. In all Indian temples there is a clear relation between the plan, the articulation of the wall and the character of the super? structure. In this sanctuary, in fact, such a geometrical composition, recalls the passage from the square (in the Hindu sacred architecture, a symbol of the earthly sphere) to the circle (symbol of the celestial sphere) (8) through an octagon (the transitional world), stressing the cosmic aspect of the temple. Moreover, the composition emphasises the function of the lihga - located in the garbhagrha at the centre of the entire structure - as axis mundi which goes through the different spheres, linking the heart of the garbhagrha with the final at the summit of the superstructure: the two most sacred points, the innermost and the highest, as if simultaneously containing the One Principle on two different planes - immanent and transcendent. On the other hand, the above cosmic symbolism is reinforced by the shape itself of the lihga, as it is formed of three parts: square at the base, octagonal in the middle and cilindrical at the top (Fig. 12). The geometrical pattern of the temple, combining and connecting three sections representative of the three worlds, evokes and underlines the two direction passage from materiality to the supra-human level, and vice versa. The upwards way is that the devotee must follow to attain liberation from sams?ra\ the downwards one is undertaken, for the sake of man, by the immaterial Supreme Reality (in this case the formless Siva) in its process of unfolding from transcendency into the materiality. Other interesting architectural features of the Amrtaghatesvara temple, which are worth noting, such as the modest proportions of the gopura and the few storeys of the vim?na, octagonal in shape and lacking in smaller shrines, altogether show a similarity between this sanctuary and the dr?vida temples of the previous periods. In fact, from the late C?la period onwards, gopuras are usually higher than the central vim?na, presenting many storeys pyramidal in shape and full of miniature buildings arranged in rows. (8) For further details, see Guenon 1978: 99-103, 226-29; 1982: 135-40. It is worth noting that sometimes the symbolism square/circle (earth/heaven) can be inverted. Cf. Kramrisch 1976, I: 22-31; Lorenzetti 2007: 20-21. 196 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Moreover, taking into account also the fact that the Amrtaghatesvara, as we have seen, displays certain architectural elements typical of the Pallava as well as some sculptural features typical of early P?ndya and C?lukya art, we may say that although the sanctuary was reconstructed in the late C?la period, not only does it conserve certain elements and structures of earlier periods, but also shows heterogeneity of stylistic suggestions. As a matter of fact, as is well known, C?la artists had a genius for assimilation, but in the Amrtaghatesvara sanctuary they realized such a sophisticated synthesis of different styles and features, rich in manifold symbolic and significance, to make it singularly characteristic and, in fact, unique of its kind. To the right of the virn?na, along the northern side of the mandapa, there is the small sanctuary of the goddess, consisting only of the garbhagrha, containing a very interesting four-handed image of Durg?: her forward hands are held in abhayamudm and varadarnudra, while the hands behind respectively carry the axe (parasu) and the noose of rope [paid). As from around the 12th century small temples dedicated to the female form of the divine began to appear regularly in the sacred area beside the main sanctuary, reserved for the worship of a god (usually Siva), consort of Devi. The rise of these small shrines would seem to confirm the growing importance of the figure of the goddess whose sanctum no longer a chapel within the temple, but a true and proper santuary parallel or near to that of god. However, other consideration are also possible: in Tamil Nadu, the santuaries of the goddess are generally considered as evidence of the assimilation of ancient autochthonous divinities - mostly female - to the Puranic divinities of the official religion. At first sight, they seem to sanction the subordination of the local religion to the orthodox Sanskrit tradition, but, as is so often the case in India, grasping the realities that lie behind appearances is no simple matter. In fact, we find progressively converging into the devotional image of Devi - generally identified as P?rvati - characteristics belonging to autochthonous female divinities protecting the village or gr?madevat?, just as in southern India, especially in Tamil country, the spouse of Siva receives and absorbs the ancient heritage of ancestral cults to become - also, and above all - Amm?, the Mother. And even when it is not P?rvati but some other Hindu goddess that is concerned, it is still she, that most ancient of mothers with the inexhaustible womb, who remains the object of the most heartfelt popular devotion, to the extent that she may even overshadow her consort in importance, although the main sanctuary is devoted to him. The Bronze Sculptures The interior of both temples is dark and bare: the absence of decoration and obscurity of the inner rooms are in sharp contrast to the sculptural richness of the outer part, and contribute to emphasize the gradual approach of the devotee inward, from [13] 197</page><page sequence="14">light to darkness, from the open to a confined space, creating at the same time that mysterious, evocative atmosphere that inspires the performance of the darsan - the visual contact between the faithful and the divine image - representing the climax of every p?j?. However, in the main sanctuary, the absence of decoration is compensated by superb bronzes, arrayed along the walls of the vestibule before the garbhagrha. In my opinion they presumably belong to the last C?la period or little later, since their slender bodies, their features and deft balance between stylisation and naturalism are typical of the mature C?la period (Nagaswamy 1995: 118-28). These beautifully detailed images seem to draw the faithful towards them: here we see represented in tangible form the multiple aspects of the divine, enveloped in the symbol of the lihga, transcending, but at the same time including, the diversity of its manifold manifestations. Ritual intimacy with the divine brings to the icon the respect and attentions due to a living manifestation of the sacred, in accordance with the set ceremonial prescribed by the ?gamas and various other texts of the Saiva ritual which provide that the form of the divinity be treated as a living person, to be aspersed daily with purifying water, and to be dressed, fed and adorned. Where the image of the god is living and the divine is a living experience, the offerings of food and the 'clothing' take on powerful significance, so that understanding the work of art reaches out to embrace a decidedly more complete and organic vision. During particular ceremonies (mahotsava), these bronze statues are decorated for the occasion and carried out of the temple in procession to celebrate once again the myths and recreate the symbols that defined the ritual and formed the features of the effigy in the course of time. As a matter of fact, one of the most interesting features of the Amrtaghatesvara temple resides in its beautiful scarcely known bronzes, very particular indeed, rich in symbolic and ritual significance. Candrasekhara on the Trident (9) Here we are referring to a bronze image of Siva Candrasekhara in the form of Kevala (10), accompanied by his vahana, the bull Nandin (Fig. 13). As is usual and according to textual sources (n), the standing god has four arms: the forward right (9) As for the analysis of this iconography, its connection with the Siva's weapons and related textual references, I thoroughly examined the whole matter in my Ph.D. dissertation (Lorenzetti unpubl. [1996]). (10) Candrasekharam?rti has the etymological meaning of an image which bears the crescent moon as its head ornament. Generally, the deity is accompanied by his consort, but in this case Candrasekhara is in the form of Kevala, i.e. devoid of consort. For further details, see Pattabiramin 1959; Adiceam 1970; Rao 1997, 2, part I: 117-26. (n) See, for instance, Amsumadbhed?gama, patala LXIII, published in Sanskrit by Rao 1997, 2, part II: 56. 198 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 13 - Candrasekhara (bronze), Amrtaghatesvara temple. (Photo by the Authoress). Fig. 14 - Bhiks?tana, Siva Saptarsi temple (Tiruchchirappalli). (Copyright French Institute of Pondicherry). hand is held in abhayamudr?, the corresponding left is in varadamudrd; the hands behind carry respectively the axe (parasu) and the black antelope (mrga). The deity is portrayed as standing against a background formed by a gigantic (compared to his height) trident with outer prongs curving inwards, while the central spike is shorter and vajra-Uke shaped (12). The trident (usually tris?la), in the course of time, has become one of the major elements in Saiva iconography: from about the so-called Indian 'Middle Ages' (13) it has been representing Siva's weapon par excellence, together with the spear (usually s?la) to which, having a similar symbolic significance, it is often considered equivalent, at least from a certain epoch forwards (Dalla Piccola 2002: 191; Giuliano 2004: 59-61). In iconography, in fact, the trident and the spear appear sometimes to be interconnected (Fig. 14). (12) The vajra, usually interpreted as the thunderbolt in the Buddhist and Hindu mythology, is often iconographically interconnected with the trident with which it shares some symbolic meanings. See Lorenzetti unpubl. [1996]: 120. (13) Although the idea of the Middle Ages was conceived in the West, the definition is normally applied also to a particular period of Indian history (from the 7th to 14th century c), when structures, social conditions, institutions and ideas underwent radical changes, departing remarkably from those prevailing in earlier periods. Cf. Veluthat 1993: 12-28; 1998. [15] 199</page><page sequence="16">In the evolution of the Hindu thought, the trident assumes sometimes complex symbolic meanings, but also becomes an object greatly venerated in the daily temple p?j?, during the mahotsava, and it is also used as a support in meditation practices where its essence is viewed and evoked with a mantra, or sacred formula. As we read, for instance, in the Mrgendr?gama (e.g. Ill, 113b-114a = 1985: 267), or in the (Raurav?gama, patala XVI, v. 14 = 1961,1: 62): [...] And having thus meditated, honour is paid to the lihga with oblation (balilihga) through the mantra of the weapon (astramantra). But the image in the Amrtaghatesvara temple does not represent merely the union of Candrasekhara and the mantrai'weapon of Siva, because it seems to reveal a deeper significance. To understand its meaning in a better way let me open here a short parenthesis. Candrasekhara and the Siva's Weapon(s): Tris?la, s?la and p?supata In the Indian religious and iconographic tradition, the various emblems and weapons of the main gods can at times be personified, or in other words represented in human form. Some of them are represented as males, some as females, some are neuter (14), and various treatises on the iconography provide indications for their representation. These depictions, usually called ?yudhapurusa (weapon-man) are considered no less than divine beings and generally appear alongside the objects they personify; as a matter of fact, very often the two are portrayed together in an indivisible union. Sometimes the weapon which the ?yudhapurusas are intended to represent is placed between their hands: otherwise, it is shown on their head or behind them (for further detail, see Gail 1980-81; Mani 1985: 2-8; Donaldson 2001: 266-69). Now, the anthropomorphic image of the tris?la, known as tris?lapurusa, is generally described as a two-handed benevolent male deity (see, for instance, Visnudharmottara Pur?na, published in Sanskrit by Rao, 1977, 1, part. II: 78, v. 7), and there are quite a number of representations in sculpture (Agrawala 1960). But some texts mention what could seem to be another human form of the Siva's weapon par excellence, called P?supatam?rti, that is the shape (m?rti) of P?supata. The term P?supata, in a very well-known story of the Mah?bh?rata (Kir?ta parvan, in Vana parvan CLXIX), is the name of an undefined weapon (astro) of Siva, given to Arjuna by the god himself under the appearance of a hunter (kir?ta). The human form of the p?supata weapon (P?supat?stra) is generally described as a gentle god with four arms, the forward right and the left of which are kept in abhayamudr? and varadamudr?, while the other two hold the tris?la and the (14) The gender is determined by the gender of the word that denote them. Rao (1977, 1, part I: 288) refers to neuter representations as eunuchs. 200 [16]</page><page sequence="17">rosary (aksam?l?) or the noose (p?sa) (15). Hence the question arises: is the p?supata a different weapon from the trident, or both the p?supata and the tris?la refer to the trident? As a matter of fact, in the Mah?bh? rata, Siva under the appearance of a kir?ta is described as carrying a big bow (called Pin?ka) and an arrow. But we cannot be sure whether such weapons are to be identified with the p?supata, since the text is not quite clear (Subhash 1992: 96, n. 35). Hence the p?supata weapon is variously interpreted. According to some scholars (see, for Fig. 15 - Kir?tarjunam?rti, Sri Tayumanavar temple (Tiruchchirappalli), late P?ndya Period. (Copyright French Institute of Pondicherry). instance, Stutley 1985: 110; Ramachandra Rao 1991,1: 77; Bunce 1997: 223; Srivastava 1998: 313), p?supata could be identified both with the bow and the arrow as well as the trident; others (Scheuer 1982: 237-38; Subhash 1992: 86-89), considering that Arjuna had already received the fabulous divine bow (called G?ndiva) from Indra (Mah?bh?rata, ?ranyaka parvan, in Vana parvan, XLI), even maintain that the p?supata does not refer to any weapon, but it is the symbol of Arjunas initiation in the P?supata cult (16). Such a view would be strengthen by the fact that the P?supata school is the only Saiva sect spoken of in the poem and, as attested by inscriptions, it was so widely spread that must have represented the whole of the Saivism in the early medieval period (Ogura 1999: 124). Neither do iconographic references throw sufficient light on the question, as the representations of the well-known episode connected with the Siva's gift of the p?supata to Arjuna are both scarce and discordant (see, for instance, Nagarajan 1993 and related bibliographic references). Anyhow, we can see that in the most ancient images, ?iva-kir?ta appears to Arjuna carrying the bow and the arrow (17), while in later images the god is generally depicted with the trident (Fig. 15). Raurav?gama 1961, vol. I, p. 62 [patala 16, w. 11-12]; Suprabhed?gama I, 13, w. 16a-16b quoted in Raurav?gama, op. tit., p. 62, n. 17. In these passages, the personification of the trident of Siva is mentioned as p?supatam?rti. (16) The P?supata sect is one of the most ancient Saiva sects: it can be dated back to the first centuries A.D. According to its teachings, codified in the P?supata S?tra, Siva is Pasupati, the Lord (pati) of all human beings (pasu) bound to sams?ra. In Vedic times, the term pasu was referred to domestic animals. But much later on, pasu became to identify all human beings bound to sams?ra and Siva is their ruler, because he is the only grantor of their liberation. For further details, see Dasgupta 1955: 13-149; Gnoli 1962: 7-18. (17) See, for instance, a fragment of a pillar dating back to the Gupta period and conserved in the Indian Museum of Kolkata (acc. No. NS2208/A25106). Cf. also Kandan 1991. [17] 201</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 16 - Trident as an arrow, north side of the pr?k?ra of the Brhadisvara temple (Tanjavur), N?yaka Period. (Photo by the Authoress). Here, I cannot dwell any longer on this matter; however, considering that the poem combines multiple mythical and religious experiences, I am inclined to think that the p?supata may have assumed, in time, various symbolic meanings, becoming not only equivalent with the s?la (in fact, sometimes, instead of the tris?la, the human form of p?supata carries the s?la) (18), but also interchangeable with the arrow. In this regard, I refer to some late South Indian iconographies, where the trident appears on the bow, in the place of the arrow (see, for example, Fig. 16). Thus it is quite likely that, whatever might have been its original meaning, especially with the development of the Saiva Siddh?nta philosophy and the compilation of the Saiv?gamas (19), the p?supata weapon may have come to be identified with the trident. By that time, in fact, the trident was not only the main weapon of Siva, and one of the most important attributes of the god, but also an object of elaborate philosophical relevance. It is also worth nothing that the trident is also the most important element which characterises the iconography of Siva Pasupati, at least from the development of the P?supata cult forwards (Lorenzetti unpubl. [1996]: 154-63). The identification tris?la/p?supata seems to be testified in the iconography: some images which, according to textual descriptions can be identified with the personification of the p?supata weapon, not only carry the trident in one hand, but, very often, are also characterised by a great trident, represented behind them as a sort of background (Fig. 17) (see also Adiceam 1971: figs. 1-3; Lorenzetti unpubl. [1996]: 142-44, figs. 5-7). /V -k /V Turning now back to the interesting sculpture of Candrasekhara in the Amrtaghatesvara temple, we can see that the god shows many features in common with the iconography of the human form of the p?supata weapon, which is described with light variants in literary sources and - as we have seen - is also testified in the (18) Ajit?gama, nityotsavavidhi, patala XXV, v. 26 (cf. Ajit?gama, 1964-65, II: 295); Amsumadbhed?gama, patala LXXI, published in Sanskrit by Rao 1977, 2, part II: 57-58. (19) The agamic tradition arose in uncertain period, but the textual references can be placed not before the 6th-7th century A.D. Cf. Gonda 1977: 165; Tucci 1981: 122. 202 [18]</page><page sequence="19">iconography. Therefore we might suppose that Candrasekhara against the background of the trident represents one of the most rare and less known images of the personification of the Siva's trident (cf. Adiceam 1971: 37-41), as it would also be confirmed by some texts: Now I'll tell (about) the p?supata, which is similar to Candrasekhara atha p?supatam vaksye Candrasekhara vatsthitam II (20) And again: And the form of the weapon (of which) mention was made before, (is) the image of Candrasekhara. pr?gukt? c?stram?rtis ca pratim? Candra sekharah // (21) The idea that Candrasekhara is an ?yudhapurusa seems strange, but it is possible (but the point calls for further study) that the iconographic similarities between Candrasekhara and p?supatam?rti resulted in establishing also a similar symbolic significance. Subrahmanya Subrahmanya (Fig. 18), son of Siva, god of war and youth, but also an ascetic - as we can recognise from the rosary often held in one of his hands, and his shaved head circled by a string of rudr?ksa - is one of the most highly venerated in Tamil territory; there is not a single town or village that does not boast a sanctuary dedicated to him. His identity merges and mixes with that of the autochthonous god of war Murugan (in tamil usually Murukan) the great warrior, destroyer of inauspicious Fig. 17 - Pasupatamurti, Sri Kalahastisvara temple (Madurai).

Cf. Zvelebil 1975: 29-33. (23) The Tirumuruk?rrupatai (lit.: Guide to Lord Murugan) by the poet Nakkirar, about 5th century A.D., is one of the most sacred hymns devoted to the God Murugan. For further details, see Clothey 1978: 65-68. 204 [20]</page><page sequence="21">ancient local deity. Anyway, probably later, Murugan came to be identified with the Sanskrit god Skanda-K?rttikeya: the two gods, in fact, have many common features and that is why the deities coalesced to give birth to the popular Subrahmanya (Chatterjee 1970: 64). Some scholars (but this hypothesis, in my opinion, does not seem a likely explanation) think that Murugan is only a Tamil translation of the Sanskrit Kum?ra (see, for instance, Venkayya, quoted by Chatterjee 1970: 64). However, whether the identity of this deity has its roots mainly in a remote autochthonous substratum, or it derives directly from that of Skanda-K?rttikeya, there can be little doubt that this divinity has absorbed ancient vestiges of autochthonous popular cults, acquiring a considerable importance in the course of time, particularly in the C?la era, when 'Skanda-Murukan became a window through which to view the whole system of Saiva-Siddh?nta' (for further details, see Clothey 1978: 88). As a matter of fact, the philosophical speculation of the Saiva Siddh?nta, also known as Tamil Saivism (Devasenapathi 1974: 2-3), especially from the C?la times, seems to develop around some mythological autochthonous motifs and, in particular, around the Skanda Murugan myths. This deity, in fact, notwithstanding the Sanskritization of his cult, retains a persistent relation with the Tamil heritage and tradition. For this reason, may be, in course of time, he became - like Siva - both the guru who imparts the sacred teachings of Siddh?nta {ibid.: 95-100), and the object of an intense personal devotion. The importance of Subrahmanya is also attested from the fact that several Pallava kings carried one of his names (L'Hernault 1978: 64). His rise to the status of 'supreme divinity' and his twofold aspect, the warrior and the ascetic, probably found an iconographic expression in the addition of a second spouse to the one that normally accompanies the god (24). In my opinion, however, the addition of a second spouse might be more easily explained on grounds of historical reasons. In fact, as we noted above, traits and myths belonging both to the Tamil autochthonous and the Sanskrit classical traditions merge into the figure of the deity. The two wives would then be the expression of this twofold heritage: the first, Vajli, would be the output of the Tamil culture (Zvelebil 1977), whereas the second, Devasen?, could be traced back to the Sanskrit derivation. In this regard, it is worth noting that it is only in Tamil Nadu that Subrahmanya appears in the company of two wives (Kalidos 2006, IV, part I: 63). In the Amrtaghatesvara temple, Subrahmanya is depicted as standing with four arms (Fig. 10). In his upper right hand he holds the typical weapon of the god - the sword (khadga) - while the spear or javelin {sakti), the crescent moon {candrd), and what might possibly be the arch {dhanu) (Rao 1977, 1, part I: 5-6, pi. II, fig. 3) (24) As an ascetic, Subrahmanya cannot have a consort, but a 'supreme deity', who grants liberation, must necessary be accompanied by a consort (cf. L'Hernault 1984: 260). Therefore, Subrahmanya is represented together with two consorts, that is one accompanying the god in his aspect of a warrior, and the other to underline his nature as a 'supreme deity'. [21] 205</page><page sequence="22">appear in the other hands as moveable attributes. On both sides of the divinity appear his two wives: Valli and Devasen? or Devay?nai who, according to a local tradition, is the Indra's daughter (Kalidos 2006, IV, part I: 63). The composition - viewed, as it were, in an eternal instant - is of singularly evocative effect, the apparent movement of the figures being suggested by the sinuous postures of the bodies, the gestures of the hands and the sheen of the garments reflecting back the light of the lamps in flashes and flickers. Som?skanda This is an image peculiar to the Tamil country. Siva, seated in sukh?sana (with one leg bent close to the body, and the other hanging down), is accompanied by his spouse, Um? or P?rvati, and his son Skanda (Fig. 19). The 'Great God' has four arms, two of which bear the axe (parasu) and the gazelle (mrga), while the others perform respectively the gesture of reassurance (abhayamudra) and the gesture known by the name of kataka or simhakarna (because it resembles a lion's ear), that is with the thumb's tip touching the forefinger's tip to form a ring, while the other three fingers are joined and bent inwards (see Gupte 1972: 3, drawings on p. 7; Rao 1977, 1, part I: pi. V, figs. 7-8). This hand position, when the image is a cult object, allow inserting a fresh flowers between the thumb and the forefinger. On the left side of Siva appears the goddess bearing a lotus flower in her right hand, as does the small Skanda, shown as standing between his parents, at the centre of the composition. A regal, decorated bronze arch surmounts what might at first sight be identified as a divine family. However, although the concept of family union is indeed there, the composition appears to allude to a particular form (m?rti) of Siva himself. Many texts, in fact, consider Som?skanda the most important of the twenty-five forms of the god (see, for instance, Sritattvanidhi III, 64, 7 quoted by L'Hernault 1978: 63). All this implies that the figures in the composition should be interpreted not only as a family, but also - and perhaps above all - as a symbolic triad that could (although this is matter calling for more searching study) express the generative potential of the god (Siva) who, by virtue of his spouse-/^/ (P?rvati), gives birth to his son Skanda, who so becomes - par extension - a living symbol of the creation of the whole world by the god. It is furthermore to be borne in mind that this m?rti is closely connected with the lihga symbol, which in fact par excellence represents the generative power of the god Siva: significantly, in the Pallava period Som?skanda is sculpted on a wall of the garbhagrha, along with the lihga. Subsequently, although this m?rti was no longer to appear in the garbhagrha, it would nevertheless retain its role as the most important divine manifestation in the temple after the lihga symbol, to such an extent that, during some religious feasts, Som?skanda is the divine form that is carried in the first place in procession out of the temple, rarely preceded by Ganapati (ibid.: 63), and followed by all the other m?rtis. 206 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 19 - Som?skanda (bronze), Amrtaghatesvara temple.

This familiar dance pose, encircled by the prabh?mandala or tiruv?si (arch of glory), is characterized by the left leg lifted up and the right one on the back of the dwarf; of the four hands, the forward ones respectively carry the drum (damaru) and the fire, while the backward ones are in abhayamudr? and gajahasta (or danda hastd) mudr?. In Tamil Nadu, where Natar?ja images in dnanda t?ndava pose gain great importance and ritual stability, we note that all these images, mostly in bronze and belonging to the time after the king C?la Par?ntaka (907-940) (25), occupy a specific south-oriented place in every Siva temple. In few cases, the image is placed even in the garbhagrha, as in the famous Natar?ja temple in Chidambaram and in the smaller, rather unknown, Siva temple of Allaikia Kuttar, 12th century (Tirunelveli District). These portrayals are so famous and well analysed in their symbolic meaning by many scholars (26) that no further comment is necessary, although there is a (25) Before his time we have no documentation of typical Natar?ja ?nanda tandava images. See Soundara Rajan 1972: 78-84; 1978: 41. (26) Among them we can quote: Somasundaram 1970; Soundara Rajan 1972-1973; Sivaramamurti 1974; Gaston 1982; Zvelebil 1985; Kalidos 1996; Smith 1996; Coomarasvamy 1997. 208 [24]</page><page sequence="25">conceptual element worth mentioning since its real importance has, I feel, often been neglected by most authors. Here I am referring to Devi, the god's sakti, or creating energy, generally identified as his spouse Um?/P?rvati and said in many literary sources, especially in the Tamil Tirumurai (27), to take part in her consort's eternal dance (28). Nor could it be otherwise, given that it is precisely through the action of the sakti that the god stirs from his motionless ecstasy and begins to dance, thus giving rise to that illusory play of forms that is the universe. So closely melded with him is the essence of the goddess that often Natar?ja is also described in the form of Ardhan?risvara: The sacred image (Natar?ja), half woman, dances [...] P?vai k?r?tu tiruvuruvan (I Tirumurai). (29) He (Natar?ja) sings and dances with the image mixed by a woman P?katt?r penkalantu p?tiy?ti (II Tirumurai). (30) And again: He dances with the daughter of the Mountain as a half. Maiyakan malaimakalpakam ?tuv?r (III Tirumurai). (31) However, as I have mentioned, when we come to consider the conceptual and artistic vision of Natar?ja, very little room seems to have been given to the form of his sakti, which - if mentioned - appears at the best only as witness of the Siva's dance (for instance, see Sivaramamurti 1974: 137). In many museums showcases her image is even lost and the dancing god is separated from his Devi on grounds of typological and chronological grouping. However, where the image is a cult object, Natar?ja is consistently shown with the Devi by his side, as active but, at the same time, imperturbable and necessary presence of her consort's powerful performance. In the temple of Amrtaghatesvara, in fact, the Devi is standing by the left side of Natar?ja, two armed, the right one slightly bent in katakamudr?, while the left one hanging down. In reality, since the icons housed together in a temple are closely interrelated, they should be considered not only masterpieces in their own right but also, and above all, they should be seen in the interrelationships of their symbolic significant, (27) The corpus called Tirumurai (Holy collection) is the canonical text of Saiva Siddh?nta devotional literature. It includes twelve books of hymns from the sixty-three traditional saints (N?yanm?r) of Tamil Saivism. (2S) Tirumantiram 1991, 9th tantra, w. 2725, 2751, 2768, 2770, pp. 420, 424, 426.

A Few Remarks on Recent 'Restorations In February 2008, on a second on the-spot investigation it turned out that the temple was going to be painted in bright colours, according to the modern trend which appears to have started during the N?yaka period (32). In particular, at the entrance, the gopura, in addition to the painted sur? face, shows new polychromic stuccos, added all around the two projecting levels (Fig. 21). All this, unfortunately, deprives the ancient temple of its ori? ginal aspects and its artistic and historical significance. This common practice is complained also by some contemporary Indian scholars. To quote R. Nagaswamy (2003, II: 342): In temple renovations, even simple and basic precautionary methods are not taken to preserve the ancient character. Superstructures are chiselled off, allowing the brick and mortar debris to fall on the delicately carved sculptures and mouldings. Scaffoldings are erected over fine sculptures, little realizing the damage it will cause. Cement plaster is allowed to overflow or spill over the delicate sculptures, mouldings, carvings or inscriptional records permanently destroying their nature. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My sincere thanks are due to the Archaeological Survey of India, for allowing me to take photographs of the old bronzes. As for the analysis of the iconography of Natar?ja, I am most grateful to Prof. Raju Kalidos, Tamil University of Tanjavur, Faculty of Arts, for his many suggestions and bibliographic references. (32) Although some Hindu temples were enlivened from the earliest times with murals and paintings, in my opinion it was only during the N?yaka period (with some antecedents in the Vijayanagara and the late P?ndya art) that the use of colours spreads greatly, embracing architectural elements, not limited to newly built sanctuaries, but also extended to ancient temple complexes.
