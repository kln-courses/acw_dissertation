<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Corresponding to the Rational World Scientific Rationales and Language   in Christian Science and the Unity   School of Christianity Jeremy Rapport ABSTRACT: This article employs the notion of legitimation strategy in  new religious movements to explore and compare the use of scientific  rationales and language in Christian Science and the Unity School of  Christianity. I examine how Christian Science and Unity used science to  present their beliefs and practices, and I focus on Christian Science  testimonials and Unity’s advocacy of vegetarianism to demonstrate their  reliance upon scientific epistemologies. I argue that the two movements  used scientific rationales and language as a strategy to validate themselves  in late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century America, which  had largely accepted the scientific worldview as a primary source of  knowledge about the world. A key difference in the way they used  science helps to explain the vastly different levels of social controversy  involving the two movements. Among the more perplexing questions for a scholar of new reli-gions is why a movement becomes controversial in a particular  time and place, while a similar movement in roughly the same  time and place does not. Some reasons for controversy are clear  enough—new models of religious or social organization, perceived  authoritarianism, or the perception of inappropriate treatment of  children. In other cases, the sources of controversy are far from clear.

The new movement’s unorthodox beliefs and practices, sociological  characteristics possessed by the new movement, or some combination  of those elements have all been examined by new religions scholars as  factors in the development of controversy. The question of the sources  of controversies involving unconventional religions has informed  debates over the defining characteristics of new religious movements in  this journal.1 Since knowing the sources and nature of controversies can  help identify a movement’s status in society and describe how that status  changes over time, examining the ways that individual movements  develop controversial reputations is extremely helpful. This article  examines how two similar religious movements, Christian Science and  the Unity School of Christianity, employed the legitimation strategy of  invoking science, and how it contributed to the very different levels of  controversy involving them.  Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910), who founded the Church of Christ,  Scientist in 1879, used the tools of science to hack away at the claims  of the Protestant world in America. Charles Fillmore (1854–1948) and  Myrtle Fillmore (1845–1931), founders of the Unity School of Chris- tianity, created a new space in that Protestant world by using science to  complement and verify their claims. Eddy’s discourse about science in  defense of her religious claims helped stir controversy surrounding  Christian Science, whereas the Fillmores used science to demonstrate  general alignment with the surrounding culture.  Christian Science and the Unity School of Christianity (henceforth  Unity) share a number of characteristics: both emerged in the wake  of a late-nineteenth-century healing experience; women played im- portant roles in founding both movements; and both are “metaphysi- cal religions” that premise their beliefs and practices on a theory of  correspondence between human beings and an all-good, all-powerful  God.2 Both Eddy and the Fillmores spoke of their religions in a man- ner meant to invoke what they considered to be scientific principles  and procedures. Both movements used scientific-sounding language  to justify practices based upon their founders’ experiences, as well as  rational observation of the world and the logic of cause and effect.  They contended that their observations stimulated understanding of  the natural laws about God and the universe, and that utilizing this  understanding would allow practitioners to manipulate their individ- ual places in the world for the better. In short, both Eddy and the  Fillmores tried to legitimate their movements using science as each  understood it.  Their respective perspectives on the use of science was key to the  differing level of controversy experienced by each movement. While  12 NR1404_02.indd   12 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World Unity certainly received criticism for its theology, the amount of criti- cism and the stridency of its tone paled in comparison to that aimed at  Christian Science. Criticism of Unity’s healing practices, which are very  similar to those of Christian Science, is quite rare, and there is a general  dearth of anti-Unity literature, most of which is based upon either  Unity’s view of Jesus or its interpretation of the Bible. Much of the crit- ical literature was published after the Fillmores’ deaths, indicating the  relative lack of controversy during their lifetimes.3 Christian Science, on  the other hand, was attacked by ministers for being unbiblical and anti- Christian, by physicians for being an ineffective and even dangerous  healing method, by ex-members angered at what they perceived as  Eddy’s duplicitous behavior, and by writers such as Mark Twain, who  used the movement’s healing claims as the starting point for a stinging  satire of all of Eddy’s religious claims.4  To understand the vastly different amount of criticism experi- enced by these otherwise very similar movements, it is important to  know that they have one major theological difference: Christian  Science denies the reality of the material world, while Unity does not.  With that important difference in mind, comparing how scientific  language and rationale were used to legitimate the two movements  will reveal an important reason that Christian Science was vilified  during its emergent phase, while critics largely ignored Unity. Much  of this difference can be attributed to the founders’ different presup- positions concerning science. Eddy tried to use scientific methods  and assumptions to show that her alternative claims about the mate- rial world were factually accurate and verifiable. The Fillmores, un- burdened by the need to demonstrate such a radical claim, referenced  science primarily to reinforce claims about the efficacy of their reli- gious practices.  To be sure, many reasons existed for the controversies involving  Christian Science, and the relative lack of it in relation to Unity, not  the least of which was the fact that Christian Science was a popular  movement led by a charismatic and powerful woman, while Unity was  a relatively small movement centered on a publishing enterprise that  had a white male as its primary public voice. Other possible factors,  such as demographic, racial and ethnic characteristics, do not help  explain the differing levels of social tension. Both movements ap- pealed largely to urban, industrialized, European American, and mid- dle-class populations. We risk missing a major factor in the differing  level of controversy involving each movement if we overlook the role  that the conception and use of science played in legitimating each  one’s message to potential converts and adherents. Both Eddy and the  Fillmores carved out spheres of influence in turn-of-the-century  Protestant America using the discourses of the scientific world as they  understood them.  13 NR1404_02.indd   13 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> Nova Religio SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN AMERICA Between the mid-1860s and the first decade of the twentieth century,  many Americans spoke a language of science. Christian Science and  Unity emerged in the wake of the Baconian-influenced, Scottish  Common Sense movement and amidst the upheavals and transforma- tions of the Industrial Revolution, in which technology resulting from  scientific research transformed people’s everyday lives. Eddy and the  Fillmores appealed to a deity that they named and discussed using tra- ditional Protestant terms, but they situated their discussions within a  scientific worldview they inherited from their surrounding culture.  They understood science as a method for encountering and interpret- ing the world, as well as a systematic body of knowledge that could sup- port their religious claims. Science had become the dominant tool for understanding and  interpreting the natural world, and, as many scholars have shown, for  many Americans science and religion were not seen as cultural streams  running in opposite directions, countering each other’s force. Rather,  a significant number of Americans considered them to be comple- mentary forces, each bolstering the truths of the other.5 The founders  and early adherents of Christian Science and Unity understood the  realm of legitimate knowledge as being based upon Baconian science,  the idea that the scientific method rested on observations of common- sense facts and direct experience of the material world. Through in- ductive reasoning one could arrive at universal truths about the  world. Thus science could be practiced by anyone capable of observ- ing and recording plain facts and thinking through what those facts  demonstrated.  Brought to America via the Scottish Common Sense Realism promi- nent in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century academic and  religious institutions, and subsequently popularized in the burgeon- ing world of newspaper publishing and the lyceum lecture circuit,  Baconianism and its inductive method were adopted enthusiastically in  popular American Protestant culture, producing what some scholars  have called “village Enlightenment.” That term refers to the populariza- tion of the scientific method as a process of common sense guiding the  analysis of plainly observable facts. As Craig James Hazen observes,  many nineteenth-century new religious movements “embraced popular  scientific ideas to gain an authoritative foothold for their new religious  views.”6 When Eddy and the Fillmores appealed to the authority of science,  they were employing one type of legitimation strategy, a type of dis- course intended to establish a person’s or group’s right to exercise au- thority over others. James R. Lewis, following Max Weber’s classic  three-part schema for authority, outlines three basic strategies used by  14 NR1404_02.indd   14 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World new religious movements to legitimate themselves: charismatic appeal,  rational appeal, and traditional appeal.7 Those strategies are, according  to Lewis, largely directed toward the “new religion’s immediate audi- ence, namely followers and potential converts.”8 In other words, legiti- mation discourse is not the same type of discourse used when a new  religious movement is defending itself from detractors. Rather, legiti- mation discourse is more properly understood as a tool for proselytiz- ing, consisting of ways that adherents speak to potential converts to  make their claims seem authoritative.  Legitimation discourse is a rationale a person or movement might  use to explain and justify the exercise of power. By convincing the fol- lower or potential follower of a special link with the divine or sacred,  the rationality of new teachings, or the link of new teachings with an- cient and reliable sources of authority, the teacher is making a claim of  authority. The question of authority and where it comes from shaped  many of the controversies in which nineteenth- and early twentieth- century new religious movements found themselves embroiled. Both  Eddy and the Fillmores attempted to enhance the authority of their  claims by linking them to the dominant scientific system of knowledge  about the natural world. So while Lewis does not consider explicitly  social tension as an outcome of legitimation strategies, examination of  the different experiences of Christian Science and Unity suggests that  his concept of legitimation strategies is useful for examining the causes  of social tension involving new religious movements, in addition to dis- course aimed at potential converts. As Lewis demonstrates, most new religious movements employ a  combination of all three legitimation strategies. These overlap and  lead into each other in ways that reveal how religious leaders appropri- ate the resources of their cultures, the claims of their religious fore- bears, and their own visions to create the new religious systems they  espouse. While the focus of this article is on the rational type of legiti- mation strategy—the direct appeal to reason, rationality, common  sense and the authority of science—the rational appeal was only part  of the larger legitimation strategy utilized by Christian Science and  Unity.9 Both movements also used charismatic and traditional appeals.  Especially in the case of Unity, the Fillmores’ rational appeal to science  contributed to a rethinking of their use of two other types of legitima- tion: they adopted vegetarianism, at least partially, as a way to demon- strate the power of their beliefs; and they wrote extensive metaphorical  interpretations of the Bible to justify their teachings. Thus while Unity’s  invocation of science as a legitimation strategy functioned to lessen  controversy, other types of legitimation strategies, which encouraged  unconventional eating practices and non-traditional biblical interpre- tations, may have increased the tension with society experienced by  Unity adherents.  15 NR1404_02.indd   15 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> Nova Religio THE SCIENCE OF HEALING IN CHRISTIAN SCIENCE Mary Baker Eddy did not lead an untroubled life. Frequently ill  throughout her youth and the victim of both bad luck and poor deci- sions in marriage, Eddy’s life had been shaped by forces that were not  kind to her.10 She experimented with several types of healing to obtain  relief from her physical and emotional troubles. When she managed  eventually to solve her health problems, it was the result, according to  her, of an unrelenting investigation into the principles that shaped the  world and its ultimate reality. In essence, Eddy claimed that her teach- ings were based on a scientific investigation that led her to conclusions  about reality, conclusions that could help other persons to recover from  illness and find salvation.  Eddy had not only absorbed the village Enlightenment version of  the scientific method, which dominated the nineteenth-century culture  in which she grew up, she also had come to view science as the paradig- matic system of knowledge that could verify any fact about the world. As  historian Stephen Gottschalk writes, for Eddy “science was a prestige- laden word connoting the ideas of authority, universality, and infallibil- ity.”11 Eddy’s very use of the term “science” implied a desire to link her  religious discoveries and teachings with a source of authority beyond  claims of revelation.  But Eddy did not have a simplistic view of science as being merely an  outside authority that could be used to verify her claims. According to  Gottschalk, Eddy understood science in at least three related ways. First,  science referred to the clear and certain knowledge of the laws by which  God governed and operated the universe. From that understanding,  second, Eddy claimed that her teachings amounted to “a method or  rule for demonstrating universal divine law.” Third, she believed that  “science” referred to the certainty of her methods when consistently  and properly applied.12 Hence her system was properly named Christian  Science, because it referred both to a body of absolutely true knowledge  and the methods by which an individual could demonstrate that truth.  That Eddy understood science to be a central part of any valid sys- tem of knowledge is clear from her own account of her discovery of  Christian Science. This foundational story is a testimonial of Baconian  scientific discovery, complete with a Newtonian reference.  It was in Massachusetts, in 1866...that I discovered the Science of divine  metaphysical healing which I afterwards named Christian Science. The  discovery came to pass this way. During twenty years prior to my discovery  I had been trying to trace all physical effects to a mental cause; and in  the latter part of 1866 I gained the scientific certainty that all causation  was Mind, and every effect a mental phenomenon. My immediate  recovery from the effects of an injury caused by an accident, an injury  that neither medicine nor surgery could reach, was the falling apple that  led me to the discovery of how to be well myself, and how to make others  16 NR1404_02.indd   16 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World so. Even to the homeopathic physician who attended me, and rejoiced  in my recovery, I could not explain the modus of my relief. I could only  assure him that the divine spirit had wrought the miracle—a miracle  which later I found to be in perfect scientific accord with divine law. I  then withdrew from society about three years—to ponder my mission,  to search the Scriptures, to find the Science of Mind that should take all  things of God and show them to the creature, and reveal the great  curative Principle—deity.13 Here Eddy portrayed herself as an experimental scientist who after  much laborious research and investigation made an inadvertent discov- ery sparked by an accident.14 After she solved the problem, she quickly  discovered that her healing was “in perfect scientific accord with divine  law.” This phrase shows that Eddy wanted to place her religious move- ment on an inductive foundation. She began this account with a de- scription of a healing from a dire injury, which was verified by a witness.  Thus her injury was a plain fact as was her healing from the injury. It  remained only for Eddy to do the research, based on those facts, to  discover the principles that caused her healing. What follows in the rest  of her autobiography, Retrospection and Introspection, is a complex mix of  village Enlightenment-style inductive reasoning and classic religious  revelation, using words and phrases meant to invoke “science.” Calling the Bible her “textbook,” Eddy wrote how, through her study,  she came to understand the spiritual significance of the scriptures. She  came to know God as “immortal Mind,” while the world and all its crea- tures were “error” and “shadow,” and Soul alone was “truly substantial.”  Eddy realized that God had no corporeality, that spirit was reality and  matter unreality. She described her “ineffable awe” when she came to  understand why Jesus did not need to know the nature of the disease he  healed and did not recommend “obedience to hygienic laws” or drugs  as part of the healing process.15  Eddy invoked scientific language when she described how she came  to know Jesus as “Our great Way-shower, steadfast to the end in his obe- dience to God’s laws.” In her study of how Jesus healed and conducted  his ministry, Eddy saw how “Miracles recorded in the Bible, which had  before seemed to me supernatural, grew divinely natural and apprehen- sible; though uninspired interpreters ignorantly pronounce Christ’s  healing miraculous, instead of seeing therein the operation of the di- vine law. Jesus of Nazareth was a natural and divine Scientist.”16 Once  Eddy realized those principles about the nature of God, the universe  and humanity, it was but a short, logical step to her notion of healing:  It became evident that the divine Mind alone must answer, and be found  as the Life, or Principle, of all being. . . . [God] must be ours practically,  guiding our every thought and action; else we cannot understand the  omnipresence of good sufficiently to demonstrate, even in part, the  Science of the perfect Mind and divine healing.17  17 NR1404_02.indd   17 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> Nova Religio Thus healing was, for Eddy and her early converts, the primary way to  demonstrate her contention about the nature of God as a principle,  which can be accessed by anyone who understands that basic premise  about the divinity.  Throughout her autobiography Eddy made claims about a variety of  scientific ideas and practices, especially the practice of traditional med- icine. Invoking inductive-style investigation to debunk allopathic medi- cine, she described her research into materia medica as having “wandered  through dim mazes [seeking] knowledge from the different schools,  allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, electricity, and from various hum- bugs, but without receiving satisfaction.” Such fruitless research led  Eddy to conclude “that mortal belief, instead of the drug, governed the  action of material medicine.”18  Eddy described healing a woman who, according to her doctors, was  on her deathbed. Eddy claimed that her scientific demonstration of  healing so threatened the doctors and clergy that they pulled down  notices for her second lecture in the area.19 With that anecdote, Eddy  revealed her notion that authentic science referred to a body of knowl- edge that had nothing to do with the discoveries of the conventional  scientific world. Hence, her beliefs also threatened those who repre- sented what she considered false science, who believed in the reality of  the material world.  Eddy also frequently employed what Olav Hammer has called the  “rhetoric of rationality.”20 In presenting her argument for the power of  Christian Science to eliminate evil by demonstrating the illusory nature  of the material world, she began with this tautological, mathematical  analogy:  The word Life never means that which is the source of death, and of  good and evil. Such an inference is unscientific. It is like saying that  addition means subtraction in one instance and addition in another,  and then applying this rule to a demonstration of the science of  numbers; even as mortals apply finite terms to God, in demonstration  of infinity. Life is a term used to indicate Deity; and every other name for  the Supreme Being, if properly employed, has the signification of Life.21 Like mathematical principles, Eddy wanted her concept of deity to  be understood by followers and potential converts as a consistent and  logical system of principles that when properly applied to the maladies  of the material world would result in their disappearance. She did this  in part by using language meant to invoke consistent and logical systems  such as mathematics. Those discoveries, described in Retrospection and Introspection, led  Eddy to begin writing a more complete exposition of her entirely spiri- tual notion of the divine. That work would become Science and Health,  With Key to the Scriptures (1875), in which she worked out her full  18 NR1404_02.indd   18 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World theological system and its implications for religious life and for healing.  Eddy tried to show that through inductive reasoning one could demon- strate that God is entirely spiritual. Physical healing was, again, the cru- cial fact in Eddy’s argument. Because she was able to heal herself using  only prayer and Bible study, she concluded that the true nature of God  is spiritual.  After a lengthy examination of my discovery and its demonstration in  healing the sick, this fact became evident to me, that Mind governs the  body, not partially but wholly. I submitted my metaphysical system of  treating disease to the broadest practical tests. Since then this system has  gradually gained ground, and has proved itself, whenever scientifically  employed, to be the most effective curative agent in medical practice.22  Healing was a logical result of understanding: 1) the science of the  ultimate truth that spirit is the only reality; and 2) the scientific method  of employing properly her methods to demonstrate that reality. To para- phrase Eddy, healing is the lesser demonstration proving the greater  demonstration of the entirely spiritual nature of God.23  Like Eddy’s autobiography, Science and Health is filled with examples  of the rhetoric of rationality. She tied classic Protestant tenets and prac- tices to words and phrases invoking mathematic and scientific pri- nciples. But, significantly for consideration of the controversies Eddy  engendered, that rhetoric of rationality was used to point to claims re- futing what both mainstream science and traditional Christianity said  about the nature of God, human nature, and the relationship between  the two. She asked, for example, “Who would stand before a black- board, and pray the principle of mathematics to solve the problem? The  rule is already established, and it is our task to work out the solution.”24  Prayer was like a mathematical formula that required the individual to  put the principles to work to find the solution to the problem. The  implication here would be unmistakable for any Protestant theologian:  it was not God who acted on prayers, but humans who made use of pre- established principles to heal.  In the chapter “Atonement and Eucharist,” Eddy described Jesus’  resurrection as an example of the workings of divine science, a “final  demonstration of the truth which Jesus taught.” But Jesus’ science did  not confirm human science. “The Science Jesus taught and lived must  triumph over all material beliefs about life, substance, and intelligence,  and the multitudinous errors growing from such beliefs.”25 True science  led to the demonstration of healing of physical ailments, because it  showed the false premises of limited human science and religion. The demonstration through healing was important to the overall  legitimacy of Eddy’s system, and the final chapter of later editions of  Science and Health is a 100-page collection of healing testimonials. The  testimonials follow a remarkably similar pattern. The writer states that  19 NR1404_02.indd   19 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="10"> Nova Religio for “x” amount of time he or she suffered from “y” (constipation and  eye trouble are frequent complaints, but maladies range from tubercu- losis to broken bones). Then the individual came across Science and  Health and immediately upon reading it began to get better. The person  was healed and no longer needed any of the old medicines. The convert  then gives thanks for Christian Science and/or Science and Health, along  with Mary Baker Eddy, who is usually called “Our Leader.”  Language of healing in terms of cause and effect—in which a disease  that yielded to no treatment until the ritual of reading Science and  Health—invokes the village Enlightenment idea of truth based on plain,  observable facts. The testimonials were meant to provide evidence for  the accuracy of Eddy’s claims and practices, therefore creating condi- tions for a non-materialist empiricism in which science ultimately  proved that the phenomenal world was unreal.  Writers of the testimonials frequently went beyond mere claims of  being healed by reading Science and Health. Many tried to cite evidence  proving they were in fact ill or injured before reading Science and Health  and were not ailing after reading it. Usually these claims were in the  form of medical evidence. So L.C.S. of Salt Lake City, who described a  recovery from a broken arm suffered in a bicycle accident, added:  My friends claimed that the arm had not been broken. [. . .] Their  insistence almost persuaded me that I might have been mistaken, until  one of my friends invited me to a physician’s office where they were  experimenting with an X-ray machine. The physician was asked to  examine my left arm to see if it differed from the ordinary. [...] He said,  “Yes, it has been broken, but whoever set it made a perfect job of it, and  you will never have any further trouble from that break.”26  S.H.L. of North Pittston, Maine, who claimed to have been cured of a  kidney ailment by reading Science and Health, added that her physician  examined her and certified that her disease was gone.27  Christian Science’s discourse about the nature of God and the  nature of humans was thus legitimized through an appeal to a verifiable  experience—healing. The very bulk and repetition of the testimonials  lends credence to the notion that science was a legitimation strategy for  Eddy and Christian Science converts. Like any good experiment, the  repeatability of the process of healing by reading Science and Health  proved the basic truth behind the system. But what healing ultimately  demonstrated, according to Eddy, was that the material world, the very  place where healing was needed, was ultimately unreal. So while her  language and methods may have been those of conventional nine- teenth-century science and religion in America, she used them to dem- onstrate the error of conventional assumptions about the absolutely  real and the methods by which it operated the universe. God was not an  anthropomorphic being whose powers could be called upon to alter the  20 NR1404_02.indd   20 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World course of events in a real material world. God was the spiritual principle  shaping an entirely spiritual reality. Eddy was not only making a powerful  religious claim, she was also denying the legitimacy of the conclusions  drawn by the scientific world. By using conventional scientific language  to refute claims of mainstream science and religion, Eddy fueled criti- cism that her system was counter-intuitive, unbiblical and dangerous.  UNITY’S USE OF SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE Unity also cites a healing as its beginning. When, sometime during  the spring of 1886, Myrtle Fillmore and her husband Charles attended  a lecture in Kansas City, Missouri, by the Christian Science practitioner  Eugene B. Weeks, Myrtle had practical concerns on her mind.28 She  believed she suffered from tuberculosis and incessant hemorrhoids,  and she wanted relief. Myrtle found the relief she sought. She left the  lecture with the affirmation, “I am a child of God and so do not inherit  sickness,” and in conjunction with prayer and meditation she used this  affirmation to heal herself. She began to practice her healing technique  with friends and neighbors, eventually convincing her somewhat skepti- cal husband that her healing techniques and beliefs warranted further  investigation. The Fillmores began a formal healing practice, and in  1890 they founded their first magazine, Modern Thought. They also  sought training and ordination with Emma Curtis Hopkins (1853– 1925), the Chicago-based Christian Science dissident and New Thought  teacher.29 Thus was born the organization that would become the Unity  School of Christianity.30 As with Christian Science, Unity writers used  the scientific language of inductive reasoning about plain facts to sup- port their positions.  Like Eddy, Myrtle Fillmore used the rhetoric of reason to structure  many of her discussions of the nature of Unity’s religious beliefs and  practices. She employed an extended metaphor made up of scholarly  and mathematic images to describe the larger process of the Unity reli- gious life. Understanding God and how God worked was a matter of  sufficient study of spiritual science, which was “as exact in its require- ments, as logical in its deductions, and as demonstrable in its workings  as the science of mathematics.”31 In order to understand the principles  and practices involved, a student must use pure reason so that solutions  such as healing would result. Myrtle argued that requirements for suc- cess in spiritual science were the same as those of mathematics: under- standing fundamental principles, pure and unbiased reasoning, and  the ability to demonstrate the workability of the principle.32  Charles Fillmore employed a similar rhetoric of rationality when he  discussed several of Unity’s basic teachings. For instance, he explained  the Unity idea that mind creates reality by using language intended to  invoke natural laws: “But principles do not change; man makes his  21 NR1404_02.indd   21 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="12"> Nova Religio heaven or his hell, just as he did two thousand or two million years  ago.”33 Mind creating reality was simply a law of the function of the  universe, perhaps comparable to gravity. The nature of the I AM, that  part of the human most intimately connected to God, was explained best  by using mathematical language. “It [the I AM] is like the mathematical  1. All the combinations of figures that were ever conceived are but the  repetitions of this digit. It is the son of the principle, mathematics.”34  Whether his mathematical comparisons were cogent is not as important  as the fact that Charles Fillmore used them to try to explain his claims.  The language of science and mathematics loaned an aura of credibility  to his claims because those systems of knowledge and practice were  widely known and considered authoritative by Unity adherents and  potential converts.  For Charles Fillmore, believers adopting a scientific understanding  of Jesus’ basic teachings would signal the ultimate evolution of  Christianity.  Now a new consciousness, a new understanding of this great teaching of  Jesus is needed. We are beginning to understand it scientifically. Our  physical scientists are showing us in their laboratories that life should  be continuous. They tell us that the functions of our body are self- perpetuating if rightly directed. There is no reason why it should be  destroyed. All about us are the forces that enter into the body, and the  elements that are found in chemistry are also in the body of flesh.35  Physical science demonstrated that Jesus’ claims about eternal life  were correct, and if people could only deal with the body correctly, then  eternal life would be possible. Here is the start of the major split in the  use of science by the Fillmores and Mary Baker Eddy. For the Fillmores,  conventional science demonstrated the truth of both traditional  Christian claims and their own claims about the nature of the body, but  for Eddy such an understanding of the nature of the body was simply  wrong. The material body, according to Eddy, had no ultimate reality.  This led to a major difference between Eddy and the Fillmores in prac- tices surrounding the body. In themselves, the plain facts cited by the  Fillmores revealed a set of assumptions about the nature of God re- markably similar to those of Eddy. God was a principle that pervaded  the universe and which, provided the individual understood how to  make use of that principle, could be made to heal, to prosper, and to  otherwise make well the individual. However, the reality to which those  plain facts pointed could not have been more different. For Eddy, those  facts necessitated a radical rethinking of the basis of existence, while for  the Fillmores they pointed the way to a newer, better existence in the  material world as it was understood conventionally. The best Unity example of that notion is the Fillmores’ advocacy of  vegetarianism. Charles Fillmore and other Unity writers portrayed  22 NR1404_02.indd   22 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World vegetarianism as an experiment that could prove Unity’s hypothesis  about the operation of the universe, one shared by many other meta- physical religions. Catherine Albanese calls the basic idea informing  Unity’s practice of vegetarianism the theory of correspondence, which  posits this world as a microcosm of a larger, more perfect macrocosm.  Through thinking the right way and practicing the right techniques,  humans can contact and use the macrocosm to better themselves in the  microcosm.36 For the Fillmores, eating a vegetarian diet was a religious  practice that could align one with the pure realm of God. Although also  viewed as an ethical issue, vegetarianism was frequently discussed as the  logical conclusion to the study of bodily regeneration. The Fillmores  claimed that by conducting the experiment of vegetarianism, a person  could test the hypothesis that the body’s overall state corresponded to  the nature of the food it consumed. Persons wanting to heal themselves  and make progress toward the Fillmores’ ultimate goal of regenerating  the material body into a spiritual body needed vegetarianism to cope  with the pitfalls of the material world. Vegetarianism was both an op- portunity to test the Fillmores’ hypothesis about the material world and  a religious practice responding to problems confronting individuals in  the material world. Unity’s teachings on diet were first made public in Charles Fillmore’s  1903 article, “As to Meat Eating.”37 He argued that diet, which New  Thought adherents used to believe unimportant, was an issue of great  significance. While the New Testament “injunction to take no thought  about food” seemed to indicate diet was unimportant, Fillmore had  discovered that diet did make a difference to one’s spiritual progress.  “It is found that food does have a part in body structure, and that the  metaphysician must take it into account if he would reach the higher  substance demonstrations.”38 He argued that food itself was life, and  described a force he named “the life idea,” which was part of all life  forms. If that life idea was withdrawn, whatever the material form was  would collapse and die. Likewise, any substance that no longer con- tained the life force would affect the consumer negatively. Fillmore  concluded that food must be pure and free from any semblance of  death or decay. “If we are eating aggregations of life ideas hid within the  material forms, we should use discrimination in choosing those forms.  Our food should be full of life in its purity and vigor. There should be  no idea of death and decay connected with it in any degree.”39  Charles Fillmore described his realization with images of cause and  effect, of science and technology, clearly illustrating the scientific lan- guage he used to discuss vegetarianism. He wrote about becoming a  “conscious vital battery” as a result of the vibrations in his “sympathetic  nerve centres” and the quickening of his “subconscious mind,” all of  which led him into a heightened state in which he felt that his emotions  and appetites were in fact increasing. He prayed for guidance, but  23 NR1404_02.indd   23 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="14"> Nova Religio instead of a divine response ending his tribulations, his answer came in  the form of “a system of communication set up with the higher realms  of consciousness.”40 This communication system showed him that food  had to be regenerated by the body and the consciousness to be effective  in the larger process of spiritual regeneration.41 He was shown “just how  to carry on this regenerative process” by using “the various subcon- scious centres” to build “the new body in Christ.”42 Charles Fillmore’s language of nerve centers and organisms, of batter- ies being charged and systems of communication being set up, and his  references to the subconscious mind, all speak to his preference for met- aphors derived from biology, technological innovation and psychological  research to describe his process of spiritual exploration. He understood  vegetarianism to illustrate a basic principle of diet: incorporating new life  through consumption of food will work better and more efficiently when  the proper type of food is consumed. Because food that came from dead  life forms carried death with it, it was to be avoided by those who wished  to avoid degeneration of their systems. In good scientific fashion, Charles Fillmore next explained how this  system worked. Each living cell contained a vitalizing element that dead  cells lacked. Because individuals appropriated the form of their food,  be it vitalizing or enervating, the effect these appropriated cells had on  the individual depended on the nature of the food. But the system was  not passive and the eater was capable of affecting how food functioned  in the body. Individuals had the ability to regenerate even dead cells,  however, it took great conscious effort to do so. People who simply ate  without thinking derived some benefit from the system’s function to  absorb food and thus sustain life, but the real benefit of food was best  obtained by those who could consciously regenerate the cells they con- sumed. He described regenerating food as the process of putting the  individual’s mark on the nature of the food: “The stamp of individual  identity” upon cells in the food consumed came through “a concerted  effort of the I AM.”43  Cell regeneration was aided by the individual consciously cooperat- ing by consuming food with the highest and purest character. Eating  degraded or decaying food cells, for instance those from a dead animal,  caused a person to consume corruption and decay, which caused real  problems for people, although most did not realize it. “Yet ignorant  man loads his system with these elements of discord and decay and ex- pects to get life out of them. No wonder his body dies.”44 The corre- spondence was clear: eating meat introduced chaos into an ordered  system, and it would eventually cause the body to break down and die.  In addition to the chaos, decay and corruption introduced to the  body by consuming meat, Charles Fillmore claimed that “certain nega- tive states of consciousness peculiar to the animal accompanies its flesh  in all its journeys through the body of man.”45 This meant that any fears,  24 NR1404_02.indd   24 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> Rapport: Corresponding to the Rational World lusts, anger or ignorance the animal possessed accompanied its flesh as  it was consumed, and so anyone who ate the flesh would absorb those  negative elements. He wrote that this correspondence principle was  proven by experiment, and he supported his claim with evidence of a  story about people in San Francisco who became ill from eating meat  taken from a cow that had put up a particularly fierce struggle at the  butcher’s hands. The animal’s fear and suffering was transferred,  through the law of sympathetic mental vibrations, to the bodies of those  who ate it.46  This cause and effect language is another example of the rational  appeal. Because of the cachet that invoking science loaned to claims- making, vegetarianism as a religious practice as well as Charles Fillmore’s  authority to advocate it were legitimated when the Fillmores promoted  it using scientific language. Since vegetarianism itself would not neces- sarily result in a clear change, legitimating it with scientific principles  became an important strategy for lending credence to the practice. The  Fillmores, unlike Eddy, used scientific language to legitimate claims  about the mundane, material world, not to legitimate refutations of the  existence of that world.  CONCLUSION Both Mary Baker Eddy and the Fillmores understood science as a  positive social force as much as a method for empirical investigation of  the material world. Not only could its methods be used to explain the  material world, it also conveyed social prestige to those who could align  themselves credibly with scientific discourse. As such, the ways in which  Eddy and the Fillmores incorporated science into their larger dis- courses reveal important aspects of both movements’ relationships with  society. Eddy used science to reject mainstream assumptions about God,  human beings and matter. The Fillmores used science to reinforce spe- cific religious claims about how to deal with the material world. This comparison of the use of scientific language in Christian Science  and Unity reveals not only how these two movements used common  cultural ideas about science as part of their legitimation strategies, it also  uncovers an important reason behind the larger culture’s more vehe- ment objections to Christian Science as opposed to Unity. Eddy wanted  to use scientific tools to demonstrate that two of American Protestant  society’s most basic premises—the material reality of the world and the  anthropomorphic form of God—were wrong. The Fillmores, on the  other hand, wanted science to help them prove that their practices could  aid in overcoming the limitations of the material world; they were not  using the prestige of science to attack the credibility of its claims.  Comparing the use of science in Christian Science to its use in Unity  clarifies the sources of the controversy involving Christian Science.  25 NR1404_02.indd   25 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="16"> Nova Religio Eddy’s invocation of science to bolster her claim that the basic premises  of conventional science and religion were wrong increased the tension  adherents experienced in relation to society, because it opened their  religious practices to criticism from both scientific and religious corners.  Much has been written about how mainline Protestant groups in the  nineteenth and early twentieth century either adapted to or rejected  the modern world emerging around them.47 However, few scholars  have studied how specific alternative religions of the same period dealt  with these same issues. The founders of Christian Science and Unity saw  the modern, scientific conception of the world as the center around  which the religious world must be interpreted and understood. Instead  of accepting traditional religious and biblical descriptions of God, hu- manity and the universe, one could discover, describe and use the prin- ciples underlying the true nature of these things by observing and  interacting with the world. The village Enlightenment concept of sci- ence was an accepted fact for these religiously creative people, and they  made use of that set of cultural tools as they went about creating their  religious systems and negotiating their places in the ever-shifting  American religious landscape.

However, her account has many parallels  with stories of accidental discoveries leading to great breakthroughs, such as the  likely apocryphal story of Benjamin Franklin’s discovery of electricity by flying  a kite with a key tied to it. This lends credence to the notion that Eddy was  familiar with the forms of scientific discourse at the time.  27 NR1404_02.indd   27 2/18/11   11:30 AM </page> <page sequence="18"> Nova Religio 15 Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 25–26. 16 Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 26 17 Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 28. 18 Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 33. 19 Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 40-41. 20 Olav Hammer, Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the  New Age (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 243–45. 21 Eddy, Retrospection and Introspection, 59. 22 Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health, With Key to the Scriptures (Boston: The First  Church of Christ, Scientist, 1971), 111–12. 23 Eddy, Science and Health, 108.  24 Eddy, Science and Health, 3.  25 Eddy, Science and Health, 43. 26 Eddy, Science and Health, 606 27 Eddy, Science and Health, 642. 28 Weeks most likely was not an Eddy-trained Christian Science practitioner.

The I AM is an important concept in early  Unity thought, appearing in many of Charles Fillmore’s writings. It is used many  different ways, but its essence seems to be what might be conventionally thought  of as the soul, or that which links the individual to the larger divine presence.  Many early New Thought writers used the I AM concept in a similar way. I AM  comes from Exodus 3:14, where it refers to a name for God, but the concept was  also employed by Theosophists and, later in the twentieth century, by Guy and  Edna Ballard in their I AM Religious Activity, who used the idea to refer to the  spark of divinity in all people.  44 Fillmore, “As To Meat Eating,” 197. 45 Fillmore, “As To Meat Eating,” 198. 46 Many of Charles Fillmore’s ideas about vegetarianism and energy centers are  similar to Hindu concepts about diet and chakras. It is unclear how much  Fillmore knew about Hinduism, although he claimed to have read the Bhagavad  Gita. It is more likely that he learned of these concepts from Theosophical texts,  some of which he had read and then recommended to readers of his magazine.  For an overview of Fillmore’s advocacy of Theosophical texts in his magazine,  see Vahle, The Unity Movement, 137–42. I am grateful to Catherine Wessinger for  pointing out parallels between Fillmore’s ideas and Theosophical teachings. 47 Bozeman, Protestants in an Age of Science; Farrelly, “God is the Author of Both”;  J.
