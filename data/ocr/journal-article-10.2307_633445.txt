<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES Looking at a single oblique air photograph is the attractive and easy substitute for the harder but more rewarding exercise of studying a pair of verticals through a stereoscope. the aerofilms book of england from the air, edited by Stuart Booth (Blandford Press, Poole, Dorset, 1979, viii, 100 p., ?4.95) gives an indication of the possible answers to the demand for general views of our landscape by making a selection with skill and discrimination. A hundred examples have been chosen from Aerofilms' collection of half a million photographs gathered over the last 60 years; other collections of course exist, notably that made by Dr St Joseph for Cambridge University; but so far as this reviewer knows, none can compete in size and age with that on which this book is based. The samples are all striking and include low level shots</page><page sequence="2">112 REVIEWS of cities, towns and villages, rivers and swamps, ancient monuments and modern industry, communications, and housing patterns. The book will be of general use to school geographers; but for university students it should form an introduction to the more detailed use, either of other prints from this or similar collections, or of stereo pairs of verticals, of areas which they also know on the ground. It is a pity that the price would not allow the inclusion of a few coloured plates, and margins at the inner edge of each pair of plates would save confusion in those cases where they are rather similar ink texture. But these are minor criticisms of a well produced volume of considerable direct and introductory value to geographers. J. W. W. Borna Bebek, a Yugoslav educated in England, the United States and Germany, travelled in search of adventure and enlightenment, and has told his story in santhana: One man's road to the east (Bodley Head, 1980, 224 p., ?6.50). The 'road' took him overland from Zagreb to Karachi, by sea to Bangkok, back to Bombay (taking in Mauritius), and finally through the length and breadth of India. Santhana dharma, the inner meaning of life, eluded him, though he came near to finding it in the final stage of his pilgrimage in the holy city of Puri. Here he entered an ashram where he studied yoga until he fell ill and, after a spell in hospital, returned home. The first part of Borna Bebek's book is little more than a run-of-the-mill, young man's travel book - bandits in Afghanistan, brothels in Bangkok, beachcombing in Mauritius. With the author's arrival at Bombay, however, the mood changes, for he is very good on India, adapting to the peculiar rhythms of Indian life in a way quite unusual for a European. D. M. Not much has been written about the South Sahara, least of all by British contributors. Therefore, it is especially welcome to find Mark Milburn's secrets of south sahara (Vantage Press, 516 West 34th St, New York 10001, 1979, 185 p., $7.95), centering largely on the Air Mountains. Lord Rennel of Rodd was one of the earliest to draw attention to the strange and prolific rock engravings in the Air, and now Mark Milburn, from one of his earlier travels, expressly visited them to make a record of some of those carvings, and also to examine burials and unaccountable man-made stone formations such as 'crescents' and 'keyhole monuments'. The author has, through his keen observation and inquisitive eye, made one of the first studies of these phenomena, which are seldom noticed by passing travellers, and he has made a considerable contribution in doing so. This book is written in narrative form, pointing out the pitfalls of travel across international boundaries from Germany via Spain to Niger. It dwells a good deal on the earlier part of the journey, and only about half way through the book is the reader rewarded by arriving in the South Sahara; but once there, a picture of the people and the desert is presented along with thoughts about the carvings and the unnatural stone formations. It is much more than a book on travel, for it shows how the author started to develop a special expertise in a unique subject which has, after some years of study and further travel, taken him to a Doctorate in Paris. While this book is a some what light-hearted account, it deserves a far better production than that given. The photographs have been poorly reproduced, and the reader is not given the help of a single map. There are bound to be future volumes, and one hopes that his publisher does proper justice to them. It must be an important book for anyone travelling in the South Sahara, particularly the Air region. D. N. H. The dwellings of tribal peoples are, like more monumental architectural forms, susceptible of treatment from many different perspectives. the houses of mankind, by Colin Duly (Thames and Hudson, 1979, 96 p., ?2.95) appears in an accessible series of texts on Tribal Art; but it is not the aesthetic aspect of house or hut types that is its subject, even though the illustrations are sufficiently numerous and lavish to invite such a response. Instead, Colin Duly takes as his theme the proposition that house forms and the modes of life that are led within and without them often have less to do with</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 113 technological or climatic considerations than with the social relationships between their occupants. The relative position of the huts within a village, for example, frequently reflects the kin or other relationships between those who live in and use them. Amongst the Dogon of Mali it has a different significance. Here the layout of huts duplicates the relationships between the different parts of the human body. The head, the seat of decision-making, is represented by the blacksmiths and the council house; and within this anthropomorphic plan the hands, chest, genitalia and feet are similarly endowed with appropriate architectural form and social function. To those who share the author's anthropological background, such a style of interpretation will already be familiar enough, and it is one which deservers to be made known to a wider audience. It is, therefore, a regret that the book's format only allows for a text which is little more than the length of a longish essay. The examples discussed are drawn from all parts of the world; enough, certainly, to show how pervasive is the interpretation offered, though too many, perhaps, to leave space to show how persuasive it might be. Nevertheless, for a short introductory book it is more closely argued and more challenging than might have been expected. To describe it as 'ambitious' perhaps best expresses both its merits and its defects. A fuller bibliography would have been an advantage for the general reader wishing to follow some of the points through; and the accompanying map could have been more accurate (the Tiv of northern Nigeria, for instance, are shown as living in Gabon). J. M. climates of the states in two volumes (Gale Research Company, Detroit, Michigan, 1978, 1185 p., $38.00) is subtitled: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration narrative summaries, tables and maps for each state, with current table of normals, 1941-1970, means and extremes to 1975, overview of State Climatologist Programs, new material by James A. Ruffner. A bibliographic note explains that materials on individual states were originally issued in parts by the United States Weather Bureau in the series Climates ofthe States, Climatography ofthe United States No. 60: parts 1-52 (part 50 vacant), 1959-60; these were later partially revised and reprinted, and the parts were compiled for this edition in a revised standard format and with the addition of the most recent data for normals, means, and extremes from Local Climatological Data published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1975. Vol. 1 of this set covers states Alabama-Montana, and Vol. 2 covers states Nebraska-Wyoming, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, together with hurricane data, the State Climatologist Program 1954-73 and appendixes. These two large volumes are handsomely produced and contain a compilation of official climatic information, previously available only in separate publications. D. W. A fifth edition of countries of the world and their leaders (1979, viii, 1180 p.) has been published by Gale Research Company, Detroit, Michigan, at $32.00. It is subtitled: The US Department of State's Report on status of the world's nations, combined with its series of background notes portraying contemporary political and economic conditions, governmental policies and personnel, political parties, religion, history, education, press, radio and TV, and other characteristics of each nation. The third edition of this publication was reviewed in Geogrl J. 144, 2: 361-2. The fifth edition of this useful reference work contains articles on 168 countries, each article being accompanied by a map and with date of revision indicated. D. W. Asian Perspectives Vol. 20, No. 1 (University Press of Hawaii, 1979, vii, 178 p.) is a special issue in memory of Tom Harrisson. The editorial, by William G. Solheim II, is followed by illustrations showing Tom Harrisson at work. Among the notable contributions to this volume are the following: 'Tom Harrisson and the uplands: a summary of his unpublished ethnographic papers' by Barbara Harrisson; Tom Harrisson's contribution through radiocarbon dating to the understanding of the prehistory of Southeast Asia' by Richard Shutler, Jr.; 'Tom Harrisson: bibliography of publications concerning Southeast Asian prehistory' by William G. Solheim II and Barbara Jensen; 'The Niah excavations and an assessment of the impact of early man on mammals in Borneo' by Lord Medway (fifth Earl of Cranbrook). D.
