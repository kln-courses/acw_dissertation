<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD RORTY WITTGENSTEINIAN PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY* (Received 29 March, 1976) The confusion and barreness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a 'young science'; its state is not comparable with that of physics, for example, in its beginnings. (Rather with that of mathematics. Set theory.) For in psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion. (As in the other case concep- tual confusion and methods of proof). The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problems and method pass each other by. (Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, II, xiv) I One central theme in recent philosophy has been a rejection of what Quine calls the 'idea idea' - the notion that regularities in linguistic (or other) behavior are to be explained in terms of mental entities which are the imme- diate referents of words, or the immediate objects of knowledge, or both. It is widely thought that a certain picture of the mind, common to Descartes and Locke, has been gradually erased by the work of such writers as Dewey, Ryle, Austin, Wittgenstein, Sellars, and Quine himself. However, this picture - the one which gave rise to the 17th-century notion of a 'veil of ideas', and thus to epistemological skepticism - has not been replaced by a new and clearer picture. On the contrary, there is widespread fratricidal disagreement among anti-Cartesians about what, if anything, we should say about the mind. Ryle's magic word 'disposition' is no longer in favor, but more up-to-date notions such as 'functional state' are offered as substitutes. Anything that smacks of 'behaviorism' is looked at askance, but it is agreed that there must be some way of avoiding behaviorism without falling back into the sort of dualism which engendered the traditional 'problems of modern philosophy'. One radical way of doing so is suggested by such admirers of Wittgenstein Philosophical Studies 31 (1977) 151-172. All Rights Reserved Copyright i 1977 by D.

This property is not due to something that goes on inside. It seems to me that if this point were understood by philosophers and pshychologists, they would no longer have a motive for constructing theories and models for recogni- tion, memory, thinking, problem solving, understanding, and other 'cognitive processes'.' If one follows out this line of thought, one can decide that the whole empirical science of psychology is based on a mistake, and that there is no middle ground for empirical research between common-sensical explanations of behavior on the one hand and straightforward neurophysiology on the other. The notion that there is middle ground will, on this view, be a product of Malcolm's 'myth of cognitive processes and structures' - what Ryle called 'Descartes' Myth'. Malcolm seems inclined to take the matter to this point, as when he describes the Chomskyan notion of an 'internalized system of rules' as typical of the root mistake of the 'traditional theory of Ideas', viz., The assumption ... that in speaking a person must be guided. There must be something at hand that shows him how to speak, how to put words together grammatically and with coherent sense ... What is being explained is knowledge - both knowing that and knowing how. The presence in him of the structure of the language or of its system of rules is supposed to account for this knowledge - to explain how he knows.2 If we once see that "our understanding of human cognitive powers is not advanced by replacing the stimulus-response mythology with a mythology of inner guidance systems," 3 Malcolm thinks, we shall not think that there are any explanations to be looked for in this area. In this paper, I want to consider the suspicions about psychology which seem to flow so naturally from Wittgenstein's attack on modem philosophy. It is certainly true that the same model of the mind which led Descartes and Locke to construct the 'traditional philosophical problems' was held by Herbart, Helmholtz, and Wundt, and was built into the terminology of the young science of psychology. It would be surprising if the overthrow of this model did not have some effect upon work in that science. Yet it would be equally surprising if a discipline which is now several generations away from its philosophical origins should not be able to stand on its own feet. There must, one feels, be psychological research programs which cannot be endan- gered by a philosophical criticism of the vocabularies used by their designers. I shall discuss three lines of argument which Wittgensteinians have employed</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 153 to show that there is something dubious about all or many 'psychological explanations of behaviour'. These lines are, as far as I can see, quite independent of one another, and of different worth. So I think it may help to disentangle them and evaluate them separately. But they do spring from a common ground - a suspicion of the traditional epistemology out of which psychology arose - and I shall conclude by suggesting that the force of all three lines of argument can be broken by distinguishing more sharply than psychologists often have between questions about the prediction of behavior and questions about the justification of belief. Underlining this distinction, I shall argue, permits us to disjoin psychology from the Descartes-Locke tradition of foundationalist epistemology, and thus from the 'idea idea'. The three lines of argument I have in mind can be called (1) the 'no private language' argument, (2) the 'infinite regress' argument, and (3) the 'no foundations' argument. Drastically simplified, they look something like this: (1) 'No private language': traditional psychology has assumed that we can identify mental entities apart from the behavior and circumstances attendant upon them - as if we could simply introspect and christen the occupants of the mental arena. Once we realize that such christening is impossible and that it is not introspectible qualia which make something count as a thought or a belief or a recognition, we see that there is nothing 'inner' to investigate. (2) 'Infinite regress': This line is nicely formulated by Malcolm: If we say that the way in which a person knows that something in front of him is a dog is by seeing that the creature 'fits' his Idea of a dog, then we need to ask, "How does he know that this is an example of fitting?" What guides his judgment here? Does he not need a second-order Idea which shows him what it is like for something to fit an Idea? That is, will he not need a model of fitting? ... An infinite regress has been generated and nothing has been explained.4 The point can also be put as follows: any postulated mental entity will stand to some 'inner self' as something in the physical world (a paradigm object, a rule-book) stands to a person. So no relation of the latter sort can be explained by a relation of the former sort without generating just the same problem all over again. (3) 'No foundations': this is the argument, developed most fully by Seilars, that the notion of 'immediately known particulars' (e.g., sense-data, clear and distinct ideas) is inherently confused. For nothing can be known save a fact, and to speak of knowing a particular is to speak obliquely of knowing some fact about a particular.5 Since knowledge of a fact requires ability to justify one's belief in the fact, one will not be able to know anything without the</page><page sequence="4">154 RICHARD RORTY 'mediation' of a lot of other knowledge.6 So the notion of 'elementary data of consciousness' is based on a confusion between a particular (the physical stimulus, or some physiological state produced by that stimulus) and some fact about that particular. So there can be no such activity as the mind's ap- plication of rules to non-propositional data, thus becoming aware for the first time of a proposition. But without this notion of 'immediate data of con- sciousness' there will be nothing for psychological 'processes' to process, and no content to fill psychological 'structures'. So the notion of such processes and structures must be rejected for the same reason that we reject the notion of 'a foundation of knowledge'. All three of these lines can be found in Witt- genstein's Investigations, although none are original with him.7 I shall use 'Wittgensteinian philosophy' as a label for the joint use of these lines of argu- ment. I shall not go into detail about the various controversies to which each has given rise among philosophers, but rather focus as closely as possible on their relevance to research programs in psychology. II The 'no private language' line of argument, I have argued elsewhere,8 comes down to the claim that nobody who did not know a good deal about human behavior and social conventions could understand the meaning of such terms as 'thought', 'sensation', 'mental state', and the like, nor of terms which referred to particular thoughts, sensations, etc. Even if this claim is granted, however, it is hard to see the relevance of the point to psychological research. Still, it must be admitted that Ryle and Malcolm, among others, have thought it relevant, and have concluded from this argument alone that there is some- thing dubious about looking for 'psychological mechanisms'. It has often been suggested that they think this because they move from saying (I) The meaning of terms referring to the mental is to be explained in terms of behavior (where 'behavior' is short-hand for 'functions relating circumstances and stimuli to behavior') rather by interior ostention to saying (II) Psychology can only concern itself with empirical correlations between bits of behavior and external circumstances.</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 155 The inference, as successive critics of Ryle have pointed out, has no greater force that the parallel inference made by operationalist philosophers of science about physics.9 Fodor, for example, remarks that the psychologist is quite prepared to admit that certain features in behavior and in the social matrix are necessary conditions for the occurrence of thoughts, recognitions, emo- tions, etc., but he urges that there may be lots of equally necessary 'inner' conditions as well.10 So if the psychological investigator has sense enough to avoid defining, e.g., 'act of recognition' in terms of purely inner events, presumably he can take advantage of behavior, etc., to identify his data. What more than this can be required to avoid the charge of mythologizing? It might, of course, turn out that there were no "intervening variables" worth postulating - but this could presumably only be discovered a posteriori, by trying and failing. As. P. C. Dodwell says: On Malcolm's view, psychologists would have to restrict themselves to investigations of simple empirical relationships such as that which might obtain between memory and sleep deprivation. But it is extremely difficult to see how this restriction could be justified. The factors which psychologists investigate in human memory are empirical relationships, although usually of a more complicated sort than those just mentioned. Who, then should make the decision on which empirical relationships are to be cleared for investigation? Not philosophers, surely.11 Even, however, if one regards such replies as Dodwell's and Fodor's as conclu- sive (as I do), one can profit from asking why operationalism seems more palatable in regard to the psychical than in regard to the physical. There are at least two reasons. The first is simply sociological: psychology has not been as successful as physics in making a difference to our world. In the face of the hydrogen bomb, to insist that sub-microscopic particles are 'a mere way of speaking' begins itself to seem a mere way of speaking. But none of psycholo- gy's various intervening variables have made such an impact upon the popular consciousness, and to refer to them as 'convenient fictions' or 'conceptual shorthand' does not disturb our sense of fitness. It is only when theoretical constructs turn out to be so useful as to affect practice that we begin to feel ontological about them. The second reason that operationalism seems appropriate here is that the slogans of Wittgensteinian philosophy call up mem- ories of several generations of behaviorist sneers at the notion of introspec- tion, and associated memories of the need for 'unified science'. If one thinks of 'psychological mechanisms' as opposed to 'physical mechanisms', then one will think that psychologists should content themselves with either straight-</page><page sequence="6">156 RICHARD RORTY forward behavioristic input-output functions or with neurophysiological inquiry. This second reason for being operationalist in psychology is, of course, no more forceful than parallel considerations about Mendel's use of 'gene'.12 As long as psychological mechanisms are thought of as place-holders for neurophysiological arrangements, unified science need not be endangered. But further, suppose we had achieved comprehensive and powerful ways of predicting and controlling of behavior, ways which took us as far beyond present notions of how to cope with people as physics has taken us beyond pre-nineteenth-century notions of how to cope with things. No physicalist would be greatly bothered if no neurophysiological correlates for any of the entities mentioned in this theory had turned up. No geneticist became disenchanted with the notion of 'gene' simply because DNA was a long time coming, and psychologists' faith in physicalism could doubtless endure centuries of similar waiting. It is true that if we felt that we had carried micro-structural examination of the brain about as far as it could go, and could find no brain-descriptions which seemed to vary concomitantly with psychological descriptions offered by the theory, then we might feel that the ideal of unified science was endangered. But so we should - because it would indeed have turned out to be an unattainable ideal. No amount of philosophi- cal reinterpretation of the meaning or reference of the terms of the psycho- logical theory would make it look any better.13 I conclude, then, that the 'no private language' argument and any similar line of argument against the possibility of interior ostention does nothing to impede any imaginable program of research in psychology. It would do so only if one could infer from a doctrine about how psychological terms got their meaning something about the non-physical character of the entities mentioned in psychological theories (in some stronger sense of 'non-physical' than simply 'psychological as opposed to physiological'). III I turn now to the infinite regress argument. Unlike the 'no private language' argument, this is not simply a specific application of a very general and very dubious philosophical doctrine (such as operationalism). Rather, it is directed against a specific feature of psychological explanations - their tendency to explain a person's ability to do X by postulating a certain other sort of ability,</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 157 as much in need of explanation as the first. ("How can he recognize X's? By recognizing their similarity to the abstract idea of Xhood.") One can plausibly claim that this is not just an occasional, but necessary, feature of psychologi- cal explanation. Let us restrict ourselves to those explanations which do involve what Dodwell calls 'models' - those which postulate entities rather than simply correlating publicly observable circumstances or behavior. What sort of entities will we want in psychology? Presumably only those which Fodor describes as 'abstract'. Consider the following passages from Fodor's discussion of how we can recognize the same tune when it is played at half- speed, on different instruments, in different keys, etc., etc. (with sufficient variation so that there is no overlap in 'auditory stimulus', but only 'family resemblance'). Ryle had dismissed this question as simply the acquisition of a set of expectations, no more problematic than the acquisition of the ability to ride a bicycle. Fodor replies: But if what the various ways of performing 'Lilibulero' have in common is something abstract, it would appear to follow that the system of expectations that constitutes one's recipe for hearing the song must be abstract in the same sense ... ... The relevant expectations must be complicated and abstract, since perceptual identities are surprisingly independent of physical uniformities among stimuli. Since it is precisely this perceptual 'constancy' that psychologists and epistemologists have tradition- ally supposed unconscious inferences and other para-mechanical transactions will be needed to explain, it seems relevant to remark that Ryle's treatment has begged all the issues that constancy raises. 4 One may agree with Fodor that if there are 'issues that constancy raises' then Ryle has begged them. But Ryle could easily reply that the notion of 'compli- cated and abstract expectations' (e.g., a set of unconscious inferences involving reference to some rules, or some abstract paradigms) is what makes it appear that there are issues here. Only the picture of a little man in the mind, applying rules drawn up in non-verbal but still 'abstract' terms, makes us ask 'How is it done?' Had we not had this picture imposed on us, Ryle can say, we would respond with something like "It's only possible because of having a complicated nervous system - doubtless some physiologist will someday tell us just how it works." The notion of non-physiological 'models' would not occur, in other words, if one did not already have the whole Cartesian bag of tricks in hand. This reply can be restated a bit more precisely. Suppose we agree with Fodor that recognition of similarity among potentially infinite differences is recognition of something 'abstract' - Lillibulerohood, say. What does it mean to say that "one's recipe for hearing the song must be abstract in the</page><page sequence="8">158 RICHARD RORTY same sense"? Presumably that it must be able to distinguish similarity among potentially infinite difference. But this makes us see that there is no use for the notion of 'concrete recipe', since any recipe must be able to do this. The possible qualitative variations among the ingredients for a particular batch of chocolate chip cookies are also potentially infinite. So it we are talk about 'complicated sets of expectations' (or 'programs' or 'systems of rules') at all, we shall always be talking about something 'abstract' - precisely as abstract, in fact, as the characteristic whose recognition (or the task whose accomplish- ment) we wish to explain. But then we are in a dilemma: either the acquisition of these sets of expectations or rules itself requires the postulation of new sets of expectations or rules, or they are unacquired. If the former hom is grasped, Malcolm's infinite regress really will be generated by Fodor's principle that recognition of the abstract requires use of the abstract, for what holds of recognition should hold of acquisition. If we grasp the latter horn, then we seem to be back with Ryle: to say that people have an unacquired ability to recognize similarity among infinite differences is hardly to say anything explanatory about 'the issues that constancy raises'. So, Ryle can conclude, these issues are either 'conceptual' issues about the sufficient conditions for the ordinary application of terms like 'recognize', or else issues about physiological mechanisms. The latter sort of issues involve no problems about regresses, since nobody thinks that 'constancy' requires postulating 'abstract' machanisms in photoelectric cells or tuning forks. Yet is there any difference between middle C and 'Lillibulero', save that we have dubbed the former a 'concrete acoustic quality' and the latter an 'abstract similarity'? One could specify a thousand accidental freatures (timbre, volume, presence of light, color of the object emitting the sound) which the tuning fork ignores, just as the Lillibulero-recognizer does. Since the abstract- concrete distinction is as relative to a given data-base as the complex-simple distinction, it looks as if, in saying that psychological explanation requires reference to abstract entities, we are simply claiming that explaining the sort of thing humans (or, at least, rats) can do requires reference to different - categorically different - sorts of things than explaining what amoebae, tuning forks, cesium atoms, and stars can do. But how do we know that? And what does 'categorically' mean here? Once again, Ryle seems in a position to say that if we did not already have the Cartesian picture (of an inner eye looking at the rules posted on the walls of the mental arena), we should not know what to make of the claim.</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 159 So much for the strength of the infinite regress argument. Now consider the sort of rejoinder to it which might be made by someone like Dodwell, who argues that non-physiological model-building has nothing right (Fodor) or wrong (Ryle) about it a priori, but is to be justified by its fruits. Dodwell is impressed by the analogy between brains and computers: "the single most powerful influence on psychologists' ideas about cognitive processes is the nexus of concepts which has been developed for computer programming." 15 Nevertheless, he amits that It might be argued that the computer analogy is trivial, because a program merely codifies a set of operations which are like cognitive operations, but no more explains thinking than does writing down a set of rules for solving arithmetic problems ... To say that a computer program can 'explain' thinking, then, would have about the same force as to say that a set of logical formulas 'explain' the laws of correct deductive argument. 16 To this argument he replies that the computer analogy only has force once one distinguishes between levels: Explanations of what goes on in problem solving by a computer can be given at different levels. The implementation of a program has to be explained in terms of computer hard- ware, just as, presumably, the implementation of thinking has in some sense to be ex- plained by processes which actually occur in the central nervous system. The subrou- tines by which particular computations are made can be explained by reference to the 'machine language' and the step-by-step algorithms by which solutions are found ... The principle of the subroutine operation is not itself to be understood and explained just by examining the hardware, in just the same way that the point of multiplication tables could not be grasped by examining the brain. Similarly, an understanding of how the subroutines themselves work does not explain the principle of solving problems in terms of a sequence of steps ... For that, one must look at the executive process, which in the machine embodies the overall organization and goal of the program, and in the human being a less clearly understood 'goal directedness'.17 The importance of levels is illustrated, for example, by the fact that experi- mentation may give reason for saying that we recognize visual pattems by a template-matching process rather than a feature-extraction process.18 To say this is neither a 'conceptual' remark (about 'the executive process') nor a 'physiological' remark (about 'hardware'), but a remark which may be genuinely explanatory none the less. The notion of 'subroutine' seems to give us just what psychology needs - an explanation of what the middle ground between common-sense and physiology might be good for. But how does this notion help us avoid an infinite regress argument? Presumably Malcolm and Ryle would urge that either 'templates' or abstract ideas of the features extracted (depending upon which model one picks) themselves produce the same problems as the 'constancy' they are supposed</page><page sequence="10">160 RICHARD RORTY to explain. But Dodwell can reply that they would only do this if they were supposed to be answers to such general questions as, 'How is abstraction (recognition, constancy) possible?' To such questions, one can say, there is no answer, except the pointless remark that nature has evolved suitable hardware to get the job done. For any of Dodwell's models will indeed be anthropomorphic, in the sense of envisaging a little man in the brain checking his templates or ticking off features.'9 This little man's powers of abstraction or recognition will be as problematic as those of his host. But anthropomorphic models here are no more misleading than the programmer's anthropomorphic remark that "The machine won't understand the problem if you use Polish notation, because it's programmed to recognize only ...." Such a remark is thoroughly informative, even though no series of such remarks can help us understand how machines can think, how thought is possible, how abstrac- tion works, or anything of a similar level of generality. But these latter questions are like 'How is motion possible?' or 'Why does nature follow laws?' or 'What is life?' To complain that 'templates' - like Locke's 'ideas' - are a reduplication of the explanandum is like claiming that the particles which make up the Bohr atom are a reduplication of the billiard balls whose behavior they help explain. It turns out to be fruitful to postulate little billiard balls inside big ones, so why not postulate little people inside big ones (or little rats inside big rats)? Every such "model" is, in Sellars' phrase, accompanied by a 'commentary' which lists the features of the modeled entity which are 'abstracted from' in the model. It seems reasonable to suggest that the implicit commentary on all anthropomorphic models in psychology goes something like this: as long as we stay on the level of sub- routines we shall feel free to talk anthropomorphically either of inferences and other operations 'unconsciously' performed by the person, or performed (neither 'consciously' nor 'unconsciously') by brain centers or other organs spoken of as if they themselves were persons. The use of such phrases does not commit us to attributing intellect and character to brain centers any more than speaking of a 'red sense-impression' as the common factor in various illusions commits us to the existence of something both 'inner' and red.20 But once we get off the 'sub-routine' level and onto the hardware level, anthropomorphism is no longer in place. For suppose that perception were simpler than it is, so that some special sort of neutral current came down the optic nerve when and only when psychological theory predicted the occurrence of a red sense-impression (and so for all other perceptual situations). If we</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 161 knew this fact, we should simply skip the 'sub-routine' explanation and go straight to hardware.21 The notion of 'sense-impression' would no longer have a role (unless there were other theoretical entities postulated by psycholo- gical theory which required this notion for their explication). If things did turn out to be as simple as this, then the 'computer' analogy would no longer seem particularly relevant - any more than it does for one-celled animals, where the step from behavior to physiology is too short to make the notion of levels' seem in point. But this is to say that if physiology were simpler and more obvious than it is, nobody would have felt the need for psychology. This conclusion may seem odd, particularly in the light of Dodwell's remark (quoted above) that "The principle of the subroutine operation is not itself to be understood and explained just by examining the hardware, in just the same way that the point of multiplication tables could not be grasped by examining the brain." 22 But this remark is seriously misleading. It embodies a confusion between (a) If you did not know what multiplication was, looking into the brain would never tell you which is quite true, and the dubious proposition (b) If you did know what multiplication was, you could not tell that someone was doing a certain bit of multiplication by looking at his brain. This latter is dubious because we just do not know whether there are quite simple neurophysiological parameters associated with certain mental opera- tions. It is immensely unlikely that there are, but there is no a priori reason why some suitable brain-probe-cum-microscope might not show something which the trained observer would report as 'Ah, you're multiplying forty- seven by twenty-five' (and be right every time). More generally, the question of what is best explained in hardware terms and what in program terms depends entirely on how ad hoc the hardware happens to be, and on how perspicuously it is laid out. Ad hocness and perspicuousness are, obviou?ly, relative to choice of vocabulary and level of abstraction - but then so is the hardware-software distinction itself.23 Given the right sort of hardware and the right parameters, it certainly is possible to 'understand and explain the principle of the subroutine just by examining the hardware'. Indeed, one can easily imagine machines in which it would be easier to find out what the</page><page sequence="12">162 RICHARD RORTY machine was up to by opening it up and looking than by reading the program. Since the brain is almost certainly not such a machine, the point here is one of principle - but the principle has philosophical importance. For it shows that the distinction between psychology and physiology may not be a distinction between two distinct subject-matters in any stronger a sense than is, say, the distinction between chemistry and physics. It might have turned out that chemical phenomena such as the formation of com- pounds never had anything to do with the sub-microscopic makeup of the elements in question. But in fact it does, and so now whether one uses physicists' or chemists' terms to explain a reaction is a matter of convenience or pedagogy. If it turns out that physiology has as much to do with multiply- ing as electrons have to do with explosions, then the psychology-physiology distinction will be equally pragmatic. So the paradoxical conclusion offered earlier - that had physiology been more obvious psychology would never have arisen - can be reaffirmed. Indeed, we can strengthen it and say that if the body had been easier to understand, nobody would have thought that we had a mind.24 It is time now to sum up this way of dealing with the infinite regress argument. The central point is just that explanatory entities postulated by psychologists would reduplicate problems in the explananda only if these problems were bad problems anyway - such problems as 'How is recognition possible?' Philosophers like Malcolm and Ryle are accustomed to bad philosophical answers to bad philosophical questions. ('How is motion possible?' - As the actualization of the potential qua potential.' 'Why does nature follow laws? - Because of God's benevolence and omnipotence.') Consequently they tend to see such questions lurking behind even quite specific and limited research programs. They are not always wrong, since psychologists (or their popularizers) often tout their latest 'model' as offering 'a new understanding of the nature of mind' or some such dubious benefit.25 But suppose such models as those Dodwell has in mind - proposals about sub-routines which the mind follows in ways which are neither introspectible (like the 'executive process') nor physiologically decipherable (like the 'hardware') - are viewed neither as contributions to resolving Cartesian pseudo-problems nor as discoveries about some nonphysical sort of entity. Then the infinite regress argument has no force. For whether or not hardware- correlates for these sub-routines ever turn up, the success in prediction and control of behavior which would ensue on verifying the existence of such sub-</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 163 routines experimentally would be more than enough to show the reality of the objects of psychological inquiry.26 Dodwell's suggestion is that nothing succeeds like such success when it is a matter of establishing the non-mythical can 'scientific' character of one's subject. This may be pretty well the last word on the matter. Applying this point to the dilemma I sketched above about acquired and unacquired abilities, we can cheerfully admit that any such model-building must grant that nature has wired in some unacquired abilities to perform higher-order mental operations. At least some of those little men performing sub-routines in various brain-centers will have to have been there since birth. But why not? If one gives up the notion that empirical psychology is going to do what the British Empiricists failed to do - show how a tabula rasa gets changed into a complicated information-processing device by impacts upon peripheral sense-organs - then one will not be surprised that half of the adult's sub-routines were wired into the infant's brain. Further, it will not strike one as important to our understanding of the nature of man or his mind to discover just which were wired in then and which came along later.27 Finally, it will not seem odd that something 'abstract' (like a capacity for recognizing similarity in difference) is as unacquired as such 'concrete' capacities as making a differential response to C-sharp. For one can simply remind oneself the latter is itself as 'abstract' as an ability could well be, and no more abstract than any ability must be. The whole notion of concrete-vs.-abstract abilities, which is accepted as uncritically by Fodor as by Kant, is of a piece with the notion of the 'irreducibly physical' vs. the 'irreducibly psychical'. Nobody can say how to draw these lines except relative to the temporary purposes of inquiry. But the Cartesian attempt to draw them once and for all, and the 'empiricist' and 'behaviorist' attempts to 'reduce' the one to the other, have created the view that certain deep mysteries which had confounded the philosophers may yet be penetrated by psychological research. Malcolm's and Ryle's incautious use of the infinite regress argument should be seen, I believe, as an understandable reaction against this notion that psychology can succeed in solving problems which philosophers had posed. Their argu- ment does show that psychologists will not do this, but it cannot show that psychologists may not do a great many other things, nor can it show that 'cognitive processes and structures' are 'mythical'.</page><page sequence="14">164 RICHARD RORTY IV We come now to the third sort of Wittgensteinian criticism of psychology - what I have called the 'no foundations' line of argument. The central point here is that much psychological research uncritically employs the concept of 'datum', and that this notion is itself a left-over from the British Empiricists' confusion between the stimulation of a sense-organ and belief in some proposi- tion about that stimulation or its source. This criticism echoes a remark of T. H. Green a hundred years ago. Green speaks of the fundamental confusion on which all empirical psychology rests, between two essen- tially distinct questions - one metaphysical, What is the simplest element of knowledge? the other physiological, What are the conditions in the individual human organism in virtue of which it becomes a vehicle of knowledge?28 The former question - about the simplest element of knowledge - is no longer much asked by philosophers. They have become sensitive to the notion that simplicity is as relative as abstractness, and that 'element' in this context must be given a sense by some theory which divides mental faculties into 'thought' (which interprets) and 'sense' (which provides material to be interpreted). This division, which Wundt made the cornerstone of introspec- tionist psychology, is now so dubious in philosophical circles that the notion of 'an element of knowledge' has an old-fashioned sound. But the behaviorist suggestion that we concentrate on variants of Green's latter question - replacing 'element of knowledge' with 'stimulus' - is itself viewed with suspicion because of such questions as those raised for Skinner by Chomsky about how one delimits a 'stimulus'.29 The obscurity caused by these various doubts makes the notion of 'datum' suspicious on its face, and the suspicion is increased by raising the point cited earlier: knowledge can only be of the truth of propositions, so whatever 'datum' means it cannot mean 'particular known as a basis for inference to the truth of propositions'. Since one can only infer from propositions to propositions, it is tempting to say, with Sellars, that all awareness is a linguistic affair.30 But if one says this, then the whole notion of leaming more about man's knowledge by studying rats begins to seem silly. Even if one does not go out on Sellars' particular limb, however, one can wonder whether there is anything much in common between the sort of 'awareness' which rats and babies have of smells and the sort of awareness manifested by, e.g., the remark 'It smells like a dead whale'. The latter, as Sellars says, can have a</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 165 place "in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify what one says" 31 but the former has a place only in a causal story (or in a fantasy in which the rat is thought of as saying to itself "It rather reminds me of the smell that morning at the seaside last year, so..."). When one remembers the epistemological concerns about justifying empirical knowledge which gave rise to the thought-vs.-sense distinction in the first place, one may well feel, with Green, that the psychologists' notion of 'datum' is designed precisely to blur the difference between accounts of justification and accounts of acquisition. A bit more precisely put, the notion of 'being an Xish datum' bridges the gap between (a) a particular which stands in a certain relation to some organ, and produces discriminative behavior typical of the behavior induced by the presence of an X and (b) belief in, or a tendency to believe, some such proposition as that there is an X at hand.32 To get this difficulty into focus, consider once again the organism-com- puter analogy. When we want to describe the input to the computer, we have a fairly simple choice between a 'hardware' description of particulars (e.g., the presence or absence of electrical charges in various wires) on the one hand, and on the other hand certain beliefs ('the number in register B is larger than in register C', 'the cash receipts yesterday were $ 238,645', etc - the choice depending upon whether a sub-routine or the program as a whole is being focused upon). Here there is no blurring of the line between a purely causal set-up and an epistemic one. (Although, of course, there is plenty of choice within the first category about where once locates the 'interface', and within the second among 'degrees of abstractness'.) But in the case of organisms things are more difficult. In language-using organisms, it is obvious what to choose as input to the 'executive program' - where this is taken to be the self-description by the subject of his own activity, and his own justifica- tion for it. The input will be, roughly, the beliefs accepted by the subject without conscious inference. But when it comes to 'sub-routines' - the subject-matter of psychology as opposed both to common-sense self-descrip- tion and to physiology - consciousness is obviously not a relevant criterion. Nor is study of the brain, since even if one had the physiology down pat, one</page><page sequence="16">166 RICHARD RORTY will still have to pick the place where the physical stops and the psychical begins. One will need to know where to draw the lines around the 'black box' whose internal organization one is trying to guess. Thus psychologists can view the input to the organism-as-visual-information-processing-device as (a) visual qualities of perceivable objects in the vicinity, (b) light waves reaching the eye, (c) light waves reaching the retina, (d) patterns of retinal stimulation, (e) neural currents sent down the optic nerve from the retina, (f) patterns of neural excitation in the visual cortex, or a lot of other things. Which one chooses determines a lot about what sort of experiments one runs and what sort of 'sub-routine' one hypothesizes to explain the experimental results. Yet it is hard not to feel that there is a 'right' choice to be made, because it is hard to avoid thinking of the place where the body ends and the mind begins as something to be discovered, rather than arbitrarily selected for heuristic convenience. But this is just the same difficulty as determining where the 'true data' (the ones which are simply given, with no interpretation) are found - at what point sense ('receptivity') leaves off and thought ('spontanei- ty', 'processing') begins. It is obvious that if we take 'Xish datum' in the causal sense - sense (a) above - one can cut up any machine or organism in an indefinitely large number of ways, calling events at the cut 'data' and events further on 'processing' or 'interpretation'. But when 'Xish datum' is taken in sense (b) - as belief in a proposition, or a tendency to hold such belief - the whole notion of 'the simplest element of knowledge' comes back to haunt us. For it looks as if it were an important question about just where - in the mind? in the brain? - those elements are found. So it looks as if there were such things as the 'right' sub-routines to be found - those chosen, so to speak, by Evolution as the Chief Programmer of the human species. Yet what would count as 'right' here? Once both introspection and physiology are put out of court, how do we know that we are dealing with tendencies to hold beliefs, rather than with causal antecedents or accidental concomitants of such tendencies? So much for the puzzles which the notion of 'datum' can generate. I think that these puzzles can be cleared up, insofar as they raise doubts about actual psychological research programs, simply by noting that nothing in such programs depends upon whether the 'data' described are 'truly datal' or not. Nothing depends, for the formulation of 'sub-routines' which can be confirmed by experiment and used to predict, on whether or not empirical knowledge has 'foundations'. No such research program could tell us what such founda-</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 167 tions might be. Once we get rid of the notion that some data are more datal - more primitive, more basic, more pure - than others, the purportedly 'confused' notion of 'datum' can be seen as just a harmless and handy metaphor. To say that the retina 'sees' or that the visual cortex 'knows' or that a given brain center 'infers' from what the visual cortex 'tells it' - or any other such convenient anthropomorphism - is no more misleading than to say that the record-changer infers (from the failure of its sensor to tell it that there is still a record on top of the spindle) that the symphony is over and it can turn itself off. It is also no better grounded. We might learn a great deal about the brain by such heuristic anthropomorphisms, just as barbarians who -had never seen a record-changer might thus learn a great deal about record- changers. But we shall not be helped to understand 'the nature of the relation between the mind and the body', 'the mystery of consciousness', 'the nature of knowledge', or anything else which smacks of philosophy. This somewhat disappointing and bland conclusion is, I think, all that there is to be said about the psychologists'use of the notion of 'data'. If I am right in saying that the soul or the mind would have been an unnecessary and unintelligible notion if we had had a more perspicuous physiology, it is because the notion of 'elements of knowledge' would have been equally unnecessary and unintelligible. The notion of common and public data which receive possibly idiosyncratic and wrongheaded interpretations is a perfectly reasonable bit of commonsense epistemology. But, since Aristotle, it has been blown up by philosophers into a distinction between faculties, and since Descartes into a distinction between 'categorically distinct modes of existence', or 'spiritual' and 'material' substances. Yet from the point of view of actual research - actual formulation of sub-routines, as it were - the common-sense distinction is all we need. A distinction between the propositions which almost everyone would accept ('There's something which looks red to Smith out there') and those which are more dubious ('It's that rare species of butterfly we've all been looking for') is all that is needed as a basis for constructing 'models'. When we anthropomorphize brain centers, or the retina, or 'consciousness' or 'the faculty of spontaneity', we think of this organ (or faculty, or whatever) as standing to whatever we regard as its input as the subject himself stands to non-controversial perceptual reports. The important point is just that this model embodies no confusion between causal processes in hardware and inferential processes in sub-routines. For it is wholly concerned with the latter. The 'confusion' which philosophers have indeed made between</page><page sequence="18">168 RICHARD RORTY particulars (Xish data in sense a) and beliefs or propositions (Xish data in sense b) looks as if it were being made by psychologists.33 It looks this way because the original impulse to psychological research in the 19th cen- tury was an outgrowth of this confusion, and because contemporary psycholo- gists, in revolt against behaviorism, sometimes like to think of themselves as doing 'scientifically' what Locke and Kant did in their armchairs. But there is all the difference in the world between saying (1) We must isolate those non-propositional items of awareness which are the foundation for belief in propositions and saying (2) We can treat such items as pattems of retinal excitation as if they were beliefs in order to use the metaphor of 'inference from data' in constructing models of mental processes. Psychologists need say only the latter. If they confine themselves to this, they can follow Putnam in treating the distinction between 'brain process' and 'mental process' as of no greater philosophical interest than that between 'hardware description' and 'description of the program'.34 The temptation to say the former - the epistemologically-motivated temptation to 'discover the link between the mind and the body' - can be treated on a par with the temptation to raise the question "How can the computer tell that that pattern of charges coming down the wire is the total daily cash receipts?" v The replies which I have offered to Wittgensteinian criticisms of empirical psychology suggest a position which can be outlined in the following theses: (1) The source of Wittgensteinian animus against psychology is the subjects's unfortunate philosophical association: The real objec- tion is to epistemology, and to psychology only insofar as it is tainted by epistemology. (2) Wittgensteinians have confused criticism of foundational epistem- ologies - the sort of epistemology which engenders the notion of private languages learnable by inner ostention, non-propositional knowledge of particulars, etc. - with criticism of the metaphysical claim that mental and physical entities are 'irreducibly distinct'.</page><page sequence="19">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 169 (3) Attacking the notion of 'irreducibly distinct ontological categories' has led Wittgensteinians to an uneasy alliance with traditional behaviorism, and a hostility to all the 'intervening variables' postulated by psychologists. (4) But the notion of 'irreducible' has been taken too seriously by Cartesians, by behaviorists, and by Wittgensteinians. There are no criteria for determining 'reducibility' except perhaps for the discovery of necessary and sufficient conditions in 'reduced' terms for statements about 'unreduced' entities. But no such conditions have ever been discovered a priori in any philosophically interesting case, and it is hard to see how they could be. (5) If we cease to worry about reducibility and irreducibility, the relation of psychology to other disciplines will cease to seem problematic or interesting, as will the line between the body and the mind. The relation between psychology and physiology will be no more problematic than the line (rough and pragmatically drawn) between sociology and anthropology, or that between economics and politics, and 'the mental' can be defined just as 'whatever psychologists find it useful to talk about'. In developing this position, I have avoided discussing such philosophical slogans as 'mental events may tum out to be identical with brain events', 'psychological states are functional states', and the like. I regard such slogans as, once again, the result of taking the distinction between mind and body more seriously than is really necessary. I have dealt only with the quite limited question: are there relevant philosophical criticisms of psychological research programs, based on the 'Wittgensteinian' revolt against traditional Cartesian notions? If I have succeeded in showing that there are not, then the same considerations should show the converse: that no such program could, by its success, advance or obstruct any doctrine in 'the philosophy of mind'. The notions of 'philosophical problems raised by psychological discoveries' and of 'philosophical criticism of psychologists' methods and doctrines' must stand or fall together. It would be as well if they both fell.

'" P. C. Dodwell, 'Is A Theory of Conceptual Development Necessary?' in Cognitive Development and Epistemology (cited in n. 1 above), p. 382. 12 See Fodor's remark (p. 373) that 'a single-minded adherence to Ryle's suggestion suffices to 'eliminate' not only 'para-mechanics' but also automotive mechanics". The point is that Ryle's operationalist reasoning rules out any 'construct' - 'gene', 'vapor lock', or what have you - which is postulated to explain 'observables'. 13 I suspect that no amount of work in "meaning analysis" or "theory of reference" could help avoid Cartesian dualism, given this result of further empirical inquiry, and that only this result would make Cartesian dualism something more than a philosophical artifact. 4 Fodor, pp. 377-378. 15 Dodwell, p. 370. 16 Dodwell, p. 372. 17 Dodwell,p. 372. 18 Dodwell, p. 378. 19 This would be denied by many psychologists. E.g., Gregory, citing with approval Helmholtz's notion of 'unconscious inferences' involved in perception, says that "we must be clear that there is no 'little man inside' doing the arguing, for this leads to intolerable philosophical difficulties. Helmholtz certainly did not think this, but his phrase 'unconscious inferences' and his description of perceptions of 'unconscious con- clusions' did perhaps suggest, at the time, to people unfamiliar with computers, some such unacceptable idea. But our familiarity with computers should remove temptation towards confusion of this kind. For we no longer think of inference as a uniquely human activity involving consciousness." (The Intelligent Eye, New York, 1970, p. 30)</page><page sequence="21">PHILOSOPHY AND EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY 171 I disagree with Gregory that the little man leads to 'intolerable philosophical difficulties', mainly because I do not see that little computers raise fewer problems, or are less 'con- scious' than little men. 20 See Sellars, p. 182 on 'commentaries' and pp. 192ff. on real sense impressions. 21 Quine makes this point: "Fire one afferent nerve and chalk up one sensory atom, and awareness be hanged. Ironically, though, it is just here that we do best at last to drop the talk of sense data and talk of nerve endings instead." (Grades of Theorecticity', in Experience and Theory, (ed. by L. Foster and J. W. Swanson), Amherst, Mass., 1970, p. 3. 22 Fodor also has suggested that the distinction between 'functional' (or 'program') analysis and 'mechanical' (or 'handware') analysis in psychology is irreducible and not just a matter of convenience. See his 'Explanations in Psychology', in Philosophy in America, (ed. by M. Black), Ithaca, 1965, p. 177. I have argued against this suggestion in 'Functionalism, Machines, and Incorrigibility', Journal of Philosophy LXIX (1972), 203-220. 23 On this sort of relativity, see William Kalke, 'What Is Wrong with Fodor and Putnam's Functionalism',Nous III (1969), 83-94. 24 I do dot mean by this that we would not have thought of ourselves as having beliefs and desires, and as seeing, inferring and so on. But we would not have saddled ourselves with the notion of a 'separable active intellect' nor a Cartesian 'immaterial substance'. Our concept of mind would have been much closer to Ryle's or Aristotle's than to the Cartesian concept we presently have. 25 See, for example, Seymour Papert's Introduction to Warren S. McCulloch, Embodi- ments of Mind, Cambridge, Mass., 1965. Papert, in explaining the importance of McCulloch's work, tells us that "we need no longer be trapped by the dilemma" of a split ... between psychology, which was based on mechanism but which was unable to reach the complex properties of thought, and philosophy, which took the properties of thought seriously but could be satisfied with no conceivable mechanism (p. xiv) The insight which is to resolve this dilemma has as its 'principal conceptual step' the recognition that a host of physically different situations involving the teleonomic regulation of behavior in mechanical, electrical, and even social systems should be under- stood as manifestations of one basic phenomenon: the return of information to form a closed central loop (p. xvi) 26 It is tempting to think of 'intervening variables' postulated by psychologists (with 'sub-routines') written in terms of them) as mere place-holders for undiscovered neuro- logical processes. We usually do, indeed, assume that when neurophysiology reaches a certain point it will serve as a touchstone for choice among competing psychological 'models of the mind'. But it is important to see that even if we somehow discovered that neurophysiology will never reach the stage we had hoped for, this disappointment would not make the psychologists' work any more dubious, either 'methodologically' or 'meta- physically'. 27 The notion that it is important to discover what is 'innate' comes out in such ques- tion as "Does all knowledge (information is the contemporary term) come through the sense organs or is some knowledge contributed by the mind itself?" (J. J. and E. J. Gibson, 'Perceptual Learning: Differentiation or Enrichment?', Psychological Review LXII (1955), 32.) Gibson and Gibson take this question with entire seriousness, and urge that, pace Hume and Helmholtz, perceptual learning is not unconscious inference from memory-traces, but simply "increased sensitivity to the variables of the stimulus array" (Gibson and Gibson, p. 40). 28 T.
