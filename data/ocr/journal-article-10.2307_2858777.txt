<plain_text><page sequence="1">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY of the Italian Renaissance has now arisen. And it is thanks mainly to their tireless industry that we can now see Renaissance philosophy in a correct perspective and we can appreciate in full the achievement of thinkers like Petrarch and Ficino, Pomponazzi and Pico, Vernia and Patrizi, not to mention several others. The numerous writings of Kristeller in the field of Renaissance thought, and particularly his studies on Ficino and the thinkers grouped around him, have given a novel and more exciting complexion to Ren- aissance philosophy. It is therefore with pleasure that one now wel- comes in volume form the lectures in which he gave his own interpreta- tion of eight leading philosophical figures of the Italian Renaissance. Seen together, these eight philosophers do really constitute a history of philosophy in Italy during the Renaissance period, with Platonists side by side with Aristotelians, beginning with the anti-Aristotelian Petrarch and culminating with the anti-Aristotelian Bruno. An admirable feature of these lectures, in which each thinker is shown in the context of the intellectual climate of his time, is the remarkable clarity with which the subject matter is presented. Hence, far from being solely intelligible to the specialist, these lectures are such as to be also appreciated by laymen not altogether ignorant about the age in which the eight philosophers flourished. One can but conclude this notice with a warm expression of thanks to the author for making this admirable series of lectures available to us, and one can but look forward to more studies by him on the leading philosophical figures of the Italian Renaissance. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON Roberto Weiss L'Opera e ilpensiero di Giovanni Pico della Mirandola nella storia dell'uma- nesimo. (Convegno interazionale, Mirandola: I5-I8 settembre I963), 2 vols., Florence, 1965. pp. 230+467. As the proceedings of international congresses go, the two volumes of'relazioni' and 'comunicazioni' from Mirandola are unusually excel- lent, thanks perhaps to the latitude in time allowed for the papers, and to the fact that the congress is not periodic, and hence in constant need of further copy. The long papers seem to be so by design, and the overall formula can only be praised. The printed papers form a fairly homo- geneous ensemble with little duplication and a general unity of spirit. The principal flaw of a number of the papers is, in my mind, an excess of repetition of known material, as if intended to orient non- 26</page><page sequence="2">specialists who have not taken time to orient themselves. The long survey of the sources, by Kristeller (I, 35-133), would in fact serve in this capacity, since it covers the whole field, and at the same time makes precise original contributions and, by prudent suggestion, opens no end of possible topics for study. Although I have certain reservations regarding Pico's 'vastissima cultura,' this assumption is constructive in so far as it motivates broader research than the standard humanistic or strictly literary references. The flurry of excitement about Leonardo da Vinci, beginning a century ago, was most salutary, as also the more recent one about Galileo, who has eclipsed the fame of Copernicus as the 'universal mind.' There are clear signs in the papers from Mirandola of the broadening of references by inclusion of the history of science, of comparative religions, and of scholastic and comparable philosophies. We must praise on this score the carefully prepared contributions by Corsano on Occam, by Co- lomer on Nicholas of Cusa, and by Batllori on Lull. The apparent dis- interest in Averroes is surprising, and his name appears primarily as a vague catchword; Kristeller (i, 63-64) touches pertinently on his work. It is reassuring to note a strong consciousness of the history of science in several papers on astrology and nonexperimental medicine, by Busacchi, Rossi, Schultheiss and Zambelli, with references to Lynn Thorndike in study of these subjects and of magic; Thorndike's writings are particularly useful in showing what texts were available in Latin and where and how they were being used. Since to some extent these sub- jects were not usually included in encyclopedic knowledge proper, they pose special bibliographical problems. A pertinent question that seems not to be asked is whether Pico had before him twenty massive as- trologies or merely used one or two compilations like those of Guido Bonatti or Ibn Ezra. The papers from Mirandola happen to dwell more particularly on medicine and astrological medicine. Colomer's paper on Nicholas of Cusa (II, 53-I02) seems to me par- ticularly important, both for the incisive method of actually quoting parallels, and for his treatment of Anaxagoras and of a dynamic concept (pp. 83-89). If Pico's 'germina' actually reflect an understanding of Anaxagoras, which Colomer seems to have proven, we have established a crucial reference, for the 'spermata' and 'chremata' of this philosopher reappear as basic concepts in the New Chemical Light of I6I5, of which Newton annotated his personal copy with apparent interest. One should ask which of the pre-Socratics were known and understood about I480, REVIEWS 27</page><page sequence="3">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY and whether in the originals or through such intermediaries as Averroes. To the dynamism of the Pimander one might add that of the Zohar and generally of alchemy, and thus approach Pico with more assurance. It is clear that a number of the participants are fascinated by Pico's knowledge of cabala, but that they have borrowed too hastily a few odd ideas from the Zohar and from G. Scholem's Main Currents ofJewish Mysticism, of I939. Pico's knowledge of this literature, often merely anecdotal and perhaps ornamental, may derive primarily from Re- canati's Perush, which suffices to explain most of the transliterated terms, including the Chaldean and other ancient authorities, who are in fact the particular rabbis of the Zohar, such as Onchelos and Simeon ben Johai, well known in the Talmud. So far as I can see, most papers merely repeat the material covered by Cicognani in I945, instead of profiting by Scholem's clarifications to study Eliezer of Worms and other writers that Pico can be said to have read. Scholem's title itself warns us that there are several distinct currents, of which the Zohar represents only one. Of comparable non-Jewish currents the papers say little. The term 'magia' is taken carelessly as magic on its most material level, that is, as it is specifically non-Zoharic. To such extent as Zoroaster is involved, 'magia' suggests superior knowledge and divination, an aspect of com- parative mythology and religion. I am not aware that the specialists have given due attention to Psellus, who recorded most of the Zoroas- trian sibyls noted by Pico: 'Ne adauxeris fatum-Vas tuum habitabunt animalia terrae-igneo vehiculo-Quaere paradisum-Oculos autem omnes in altum sursum extendito.' Since these are reminiscent of the Sadder, and hence of the Avestas, the cabalism they may imply vastly complicates a simple Zoharic tradition. The term 'Chaldean,' too hastily interpreted in several papers, is a function of this current as well as of the partly mythical rabbis like Onchelos. Regarding research along these lines, it seems to me that Wind's short paper (11, I97-203) on the Orphic Hymns, with pertinent allusions to Proclus and to Plutarch, makes an incisive contribution. The vital subject of graphic images is approached by Miss Yates in her paper on Pico and magic (I, 159-I96), in passing remarks on the medal of the Three Graces (p. i66) and on Pinturicchio's frescoes (pp. 194- I95). Miss Yates's allusions to F. Saxl, like those to Scholem and to the Zohar, do not bring out the importance of this subject: the vast system of astrological forms, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, was well 28</page><page sequence="4">codified by Saxl, but must be examined in the light of gnostic talismans, of the pseudo-Ptolemaic 'magic images' intended for incantations, and the rich alchemical system, already active by I5oo. Many ostensibly cabalist details appear in these parallel traditions, and study of them might for example add to what we know about the Zoharic Metatron, or the Na'ar, and the Fool of the Tarot. Several of the shorter informative papers appear to make a positive contribution. Weiss treats of Pico's influence and reputation in England down to Robert Burton. Marcel's recapitulation of the circumstances of the condemnation seems to answer all immediate questions regarding this topic. Mattioli notes several quotations from Lucian. Mesnard's analysis ofBodin's Demonomanie, though of little immediate concern to Pico, draws attention to a basic field of knowledge related to magic, mythology, and alchemy. The several papers dealing with minor con- temporaries known personally to Pico could only be judged by reread- ing the considerable existing literature on this subject; my impression is that there is here little new. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY Francis J. Carmody II carteggio di Michelangelo. Edizione postuma di Giovanni Poggi a cura di Paola Barocchi e Renzo Ristori sotto gli auspici dell'Istituto nazionale di studi sul Rinascimento. Florence, Sansoni, I, I965. xxiv+43I pp. Miss Barocchi's Introduction tells how, for nearly half a century, Giovanni Poggi devoted his life to preparing the publication of Michel- angelo's correspondence. Soon after restrictions had been lifted from the consultation of papers in the Buonarroti archive at the close of the last century,1 Poggi was asked to share in preparing a definitive edition, which was contracted for in I898. The following year the contract was declared broken by the unexpected appearance in Berlin of Karl Frey's Ausgewdhlte Briefe an Michelangelo, a publication that prompted one of the Italian promoters to refer to his colleagues as 'victims of a theft of a German Professor, who is now very proud of this action done for the glory of German Science.' A new arrangement, for a National Edition, was announced in I9IO, and others at regular intervals thereafter. The failure of every effort was due largely to Poggi's inability to set practical limits to the precision and extent of his research; he attempted not only 1 The letters written by Michelangelo himself had been published by Gaetano Milanesi in 1875; Miss Barocchi does not explain how it happened that the limitations of the bequest affected only those addressed to the artist.
