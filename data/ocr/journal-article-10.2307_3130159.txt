Armstrong, Central College, Iowa Contrary to the popular view, the popular interpretation of Hume's argumenta- tion against belief in miracles does beg the question against believers. The most popular effort to turn the charge aside, the "both sides need the laws of nature" argument, found in Flew and Mackie fails. So does a recent attempt by George Schlesinger as well as one by J.C. Thornton. Given the empirical nature of the "the Laws of Nature", begging-the-question here is inevitable. SECOND ORDER COERCION AND FREEDOM OF THE WILL Denis Arnold, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis If one takes seriously the possibility that having or lacking certain second-order desires can effect a person's autonomy, one may recognize a form of coercion that has not been adequately discussed. In this paper I provide an account of such a form of coercion. I begin by taking up Harry Frankfurt's account of coercion. I argue that one should not be interested in defending Frankfurt's narrow account of coercion if one does so mainly to support an account of the conditions of moral responsibility similar to Frankfurt's, and I argue that his account is too narrow to accept on independent grounds. I draw from Frankfurt's rich conceptu- al framework in order to develop an account of coercion which takes place at the level of second-order volitions. I conclude by providing a brief sketch of an expanded account of coercion. TIME AND TIME AGAIN Harriet Baber, University of San Diego Time is, of course, circular--in that we measure some units of time cyclically. To this extent any manifold is potentially cyclical since we can always impose some scheme of cyclic measurement upon it. Nevertheless, there appear to be cycles which are not merely imposed by conven- tion: some families of properties seem to lend themselves naturally to cyclical organization. Could time be, in any metaphysically interesting sense, circular? I 65</page><page sequence="2">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 suggest that while it is possible to impose a cyclic structure on successive states of the world, given the logical character of identity, as an indiscernibility relation, history cannot, in any metaphysically interesting sense, repeat itself. MORRIS ON THE INCARNATION Allan Back, Kutztown University Here I examine Thomas Morris' proof that the doctrine of the Incarnation is consistent. In short, he seeks to maintain Aquinas' position with two key differ- ences: he rejects the notion that introducing reduplicative propositions will solve the problem of consistency; he claims that the attributes essential to human nature and those essential to divine nature are consistent. I first present the Thomist position and Morris' critique of it. I then turn to Morris' own proof, and claim that his own view also requires the use of reduplicative propositions. But, given this use of reduplicative propositions, his view has the same flaw that he has rightly found in Aquinas. I conclude, therefore, that Morris does not succeed in showing the Incarnation to be consistent. CANCER AND THE IDEA OF THE SELF Marlene Benjamin, Stonehill College Some recent work in mind theory utilizes the distinction between objective and subjective viewpoints to gain insight into how the self operates in the world. The distinction is often criticized on the ground that it posits a metaphysical monster constructed along logically insupportable Cartesian lines. The experience of cancer offers an illuminating philosophical tool for thinking about the relation between objective and subjective perspectives on the same thing. In this article, I combine some of the methodology of analytic philosophy with the descriptions of first-person narrative in an attempt to discover why the objective/subjective distinction makes sense, despite its Cartesian structural flaws. THE PROMISE OF PURE CONSCIOUSNESS Donald N. Blakeley, California State University, Fresno The paper examines the debate between the constructivist position on the nature of mystical experience and the pure consciousness position. The challenge to the constructivist interpretation is examined and evaluated. The major features of the pure consciousness position are delineated and evaluated. Both positions are seen to be important contributions to the field of inquiry but also inadequate in a number of respects that are identified. Some issues that are important for each position are left unresolved, so that the debate has not achieved a well developed response to the issues that are at stake. 66</page><page sequence="3">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM WHAT NARROW CONTEXT IS NOT Curtis Brown, Trinity University Valerie Walker and Stephen Stich have offered a device for expressing narrow content. I argue that the device is fatally flawed. On one interpretation, it will not count people who are clearly in the same narrow mental state as having the same narrow content. On another interpretation, it will not provide a useful psychological typology, since it will count people with radically different beliefs as sharing the same narrow content. Either way, it does not capture the notion Fodor had in mind, since it does not determine a function from contexts to broad contents. A related device recognizably in the same spirit as Walker's and Stich's provides a better explication of Fodor's notion (though it does not provide a means of expressing narrow contents). SWAMPMAN OF LA MANCHA Deborah Brown, University of Toronto Swampman has been cited (sighted?) in several places (see Stephen Stich "Auton- omous Psychology and the Belief-Desire Thesis" in The Monist, 61 (1978), pp. 573-591; Alan H. Goldman, "Fanciful Arguments for Realism" in Mind, 93 (1984), pp. 19-38; and Donald Davidson, "Knowing One's Own Mind" in Proceedings and Addresses of the APA, v. 60 #3 (1987), pp. 441-458.) but the Swampman of this tale is akin to the one described by Davidson. In Davidson's article Swampman is appealed to as intuitive support for an externalist thesis which, contra Putnam, doesn't retreat to "narrow psychological states" to preserve first person authority. Not all of that which Davidson is interested in concerns our story although the individualism vs. externalism debate figures prominently. Both sides seem united on this point: that no Swampman, despite being the molecular duplicate of you or I has any of our psychological states for lacking a causal history a Swampman cannot be said to have thoughts, etc., about anything and lacking our causal connection to events in the world certainly cannot be said to share our thoughts. At this point the protagonists divide, Stich argues that replicas like Swampman have "narrow"--i.e. syntactic--states which are not beliefs, desires, etc., but suitable for a truly scientific psychology whereas Davidson denies Swampman intention- ality initially but concedes that he "simply needs time in which to acquire a causal history that would make sense of the claim that he is speaking of, remembering, identifying, or thinking of items in the world." (op. cit., p. 456) Neither of these positions is very satisfying, especially if you're unlucky enough to be a Swamp- critter, and to make this clear one Swampman's story is told here just as it happened. . .. 67</page><page sequence="4">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 MIRACLES IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS; LEIBNIZ'S DILEMMA AND LEIBNIZ'S RAZOR Gregory Brown, University of Houston In the first section of this paper I shall discuss what Leibniz meant by a miracle and why Leibniz's definition of the best of all possible worlds implies that it is a world in which miracles are minimized. In the second part of the paper I shall argue that human happiness within the best of all possible worlds also requires, on Leibniz's principles, that miracles must there by minimized. In the third section of the paper I shall consider what, if any, miracles actually remain possible for Leibniz within the best of all possible worlds. In the final section I shall discuss one important kind of event about which Leibniz vacillated on whether it required miraculous intervention--namely, the elevation of the sensitive soul to rationality--and I shall offer some speculation about the cause of this vacillation in Leibniz. DOING IT WITH MIRRORS Mark Brown, Syracuse University Examples in which a person doesn't realize he is seeing himself (in a mirror) suggest a basic distinction between de re and de se attitudes. Boer and Lycan (1980) produce parallel, purely de re examples, to show that something other than a de relde se distinction is needed, and probably will suffice. They don't decide what is needed. This paper argues that: (1) it isn't accurate to speak of attitudes de re (etc.); in most cases it is references (occurrences of terms) that are de re (etc.); (2) the purely de re case should not, and sometimes cannot, be re- solved by narrowing scopes of negations; (3) it should be resolved by recognizing the de dicto character of references the puzzle mistakenly describes as de re; genuine de re references are probably rare, and de re references are the clearest examples of reference de re. HEGEL, POLITICAL REPRESENTATION, AND CIVIC REPUBLICANISM Andrew Buchwalter, Yale University, University of N. Florida Hegel's political philosophy is often deemed inimical to the ends of civic republi- canism, since it is based on a concept of political representation that not only precluded direct political participation in affairs of state but restricts participation to involvement in intermediate associations committed to defending corporate rather than national interests. This paper argues that Hegel's concept of corpo- rate representation, far from undermining republicanism, allows for its modern and indeed general realization. While not denying problems with Hegel's theory, 68</page><page sequence="5">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM I argue that its value lies precisely in its effort to specify realistic conditions for civic republicanism in the large-scale complex nation-states of the modern world. COPPER STATUES AND PIECES OF COPPER-- A CHALLENGE TO THE STANDARD ACCOUNT Michael B. Burke, Indiana University We have before us a copper statue. In the same place, presumably, there is a piece of coppei. What is the relationship between the statue and the piece of copper? The most popular account of such cases is one on which the statue and the piece of copper are numerically different objects even though they consist of just the same matter and are wholly present in just the same place. I argue that this account must be rejected. THE ASYMMETRICAL RIGHTS OF INTEREST GROUPS Edmund F. Byrne, Indiana University Monolithic views of egalitarianism tend to discount the importance and legitimacy of diverse interests and needs which a democracy can and should accommodate. This diversity is commonly represented by interest groups whose influence, though not always commensurable, surpasses that of the unassociated individual. Such groups have accordingly been defended by philosophers such as Dewey, Rawls, and Habermas. Against this philosophical background, it can be argued, for example, that women's interests can be accommodated in public policy not only on the basis of egalitarian provisions but asymmetrically, insofar as their special interests are also in the public interest. Decision-making procedures in this regard may remain symmetrical; but women as a social group must be incorporat- ed into the public sphere not just symbolically or procedurally but structurally. MINIMAL DUALISM; SOME WORLDLY MISGIVINGS William Carter, North Carolina State University In its non-branching form, psychological continuity is arguably sufficient for personal but not animal identity. Accepting this, defenders of the MD (minimal dualism) position argue that no person is strictly identical with any human being. Although MDism does not imply any version of CDism (Cartesian dualism), I argue that it has objectionable features. On a "constitutional" version of the story, either we must deny that the human organisms with which we coexist are psycho- logical beings or we must allow that numerically distinct psychological beings are present where each of us is located. MD theorists may seek to avoid this disjunc- tion by rejecting constitutionalism and judging that human beings and persons are properly viewed as "overlapping" temporal worms. This has its own worrisome corollaries. In particular, I argue that either we are left with a view that cannot accommodate facts concerning de re modality or a highly counterintuitive modal realism. The moral of the story is that we do well not to accept a psychological continuity approach to personal identity. 69</page><page sequence="6">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 MERELY PHENOMENAL KNOWLEDGE Earl Conee, University of Rochester Frank Jackson's knowledge argument contends that knowing what an experience is like is knowledge of non-physical information. Critics of the knowledge argument often concur that knowing what an experience is like is not knowledge of physical information, while denying that it is knowledge of non-physical information. It is not knowledge of information at all. This seems right. But a leading tendency among critics is to analyze this knowledge in terms of abilities. The present paper contends that it is better analyzed in terms of acquaintance, a maximally direct cognitive relation. THOMAS REID'S NON-DOGMATIC RESPONSE TO HUME'S SKEPTICAL WORRIES William C. Davis, University of Notre Dame In spite of a tradition, reaching back to Kant, that understands Thomas Reid as a dogmatist, there is ample reason to believe that Reid takes Hume's skeptical worries seriously. In his essay "Of Reasoning" Reid responds to David Hume's "Of skepticism with regard to reason" by drawing upon a conception of evidence indebted to Scottish judicial practice. This conception of evidence, argued for in his other essays, enables Reid to set aside Hume's worries without dismissing them simply because of their skeptical conclusions. After clarifying Hume's worries in the section of the Treatise that Reid is addressing, this paper develops Reid's response and the conception of evidence upon which it depends in order to show that Reid should be cleared of the charge of treating Hume's worries dogmatically. JOHN STUART MILL'S LIBERAL FEMINISM Wendy Donner, Carleton University In this paper I set out and defend some aspects of Mill's liberal feminism and its foundation in his utilitarian moral philosophy. Liberal feminist theories have been the subject of intense scrutiny in current debates among feminist scholars. In this paper I look at some recent critiques of liberal feminism and argue that Mill's conceptions of the self, individualism and self-development meet many of the concerns raised by critics of liberal feminism whose concerns are more correctly focused on other models of liberalism. I end with an examination of some of the problems of communitarian feminism which are mitigated by an appeal to liberal values. HYPERACTIVE ETHICS Julia Driver, Brooklyn College/CUNY A well known problem for liberalism is the apparently self defeating stance it takes on the issue of tolerating diverse moral perspectives. How can the liberal 70</page><page sequence="7">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM consistently maintain that the state should not interfere in matters of personal morality, while condemning, morally, the behavior it seeks to protect? I argue that this problem is not peculiar to liberalism. Most individuals feel reluctant to impose their values--moral or otherwise--on others. Indeed, the problem will arise in almost any evaluative context, though it is more disturbing in morality because of the apparent overridingness of moral reasons. Those who are not constrained; who eagerly seek to impose their values on others, I call "morally hyperactive." I argue that a person who is morally hyperac- tive violates meta-moral principles which enjoin moral constraint in certain contexts, and this is what makes their behavior inappropriate. With this analysis I hope also to salvage some of our intuitions about non-interference which seem naively relativistic, and thus thoroughly discredited. HEGEL AND MARX ON ALIENATION David Duquette, St. Norbert College The paper aims to dispel a common misconception about Hegel, that is, that in his view alienation is an inevitable and insurmountable feature of human exis- tence and that it can be overcome only in the realm of pure thought. I focus on Marx as a source of this interpretation of Hegel, particularly the views he present- ed in the Philosophic and Economic Manuscripts. Also, I discuss one commenta- tor's discussion of this issue to illustrate the problem of taking Marx's views and criticisms of Hegel uncritically. WITTGENSTEIN AND RELIGION: PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT LEAVE EVERYTHING AS IT IS Gabe Eisenstein, Corvallis, Oregon Wittgenstein's view of religion downplays the importance of beliefs about tran- scendent entities. This makes it hard to see how there can be any religious understanding, as well as making the account seem implausible when applied to "ordinary" religious believers. Both difficulties have been exacerbated by inter- preters (pro and con) who regard religion as uniform and static. But if religion is viewed as a family of phenomena arranged in characteristic sequences and phases (possessing what I suggest is a narrative structure), it becomes possible to leave room for literal religious belief in some of those phases, while considering that religious understanding ultimately pertains to the organization of attitudes, perceptions and behavior--not to the attainment of metaphysical beliefs. And if Wittgenstein's writing supports this view of religion, it cannot be "merely descrip- tive" as is commonly maintained; for it works to intervene in the progress of religious discourse and its interpretation. 71</page><page sequence="8">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 EXTERNALISM AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE Kevin Falvey, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Externalist theories of mental content hold that the contents of an individual's mental states are determined in part by features of the individual's social or physical environment. Some philosophers have thought that externalism threatens to undermine the idea that our knowledge of the contents of our own mental states is direct and authoritative, and not based on observation of our behavior or our surroundings. I argue that this is not the case. I consider two arguments, due to Paul Boghossian and Anthony Brueckner, that attempt to establish that if externalism is true, we do not have direct knowledge of our own mental states. I show that both arguments fail. WHAT DO WE REALLY WANT? Richard Farr, University of Hawaii, Manoa Several philosophers, e.g. Nozick, have pointed out that we tend to describe our desires as desires for objective situations and not as desires for the experience which usually accompanies the objective situation. There is a tendency to move quickly from this uncontroversial observation to the claim that what we "really" desire is the objective state of affairs: i.e., that what explains our interest in some subjective state is usually our prior interest in the corresponding objective states of affairs, and not vice versa. However this "Objectivism" about desires is actually quite hard to defend, because the opposite case--that our interest in objective situations is usually best explained by our prior interest in certain characteristic subjective states--is a much more powerful theory than "objectivists" typically suppose. ON SOME ALLEGED PARADOXES OF DETERRENCE Daniel Farrell, Ohio State University In his recent book, Gregory Kavka discusses again the "paradoxes of deterrence" that were the object of his attention some years ago in what has become a well- known and highly-regarded essay. In the book, as in the original essay, Kavka describes what he believes are three apparent paradoxes, his aim being to show us, in each case, what has to be done if genuine paradox is to be avoided. I argue in what follows that two of Kavka's three "paradoxes" are not even prima facie paradoxical. I then discuss the remaining paradox, arguing that while here too Kavka is mistaken to claim to have identified an apparent paradox, he has brought to light an extremely interesting puzzle. I conclude with some remarks of my own about this puzzle. 72</page><page sequence="9">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM CHAOTIC COGNITION: PROSPECTS FOR SYMBOLIC PROCESSING IN A DYNAMIC MIND James W. Garson, University of Houston The successful application of chaos theory to a wide variety of disciplines suggests that chaos is a universal phenomenon of nature with implications for cognitive science as well. Some have suggested that chaos is the magic that explains human intelligence. Classicists, who view the mind as something like a computer pro- gram, will object that chaos is not likely to have a functional role in cognition, and even if it did, that function could easily be incorporated into their symbolic processing model. Either way classicism wins. We show that this reasoning misunderstands the nature of chaos. Chaos could have a useful function at the cognitive level, and that function may not even be approximated by classical methods. Psychology based on chaotic dynamics offers a new paradigm for explaining how regularities of thought are possible. It would challenge the autonomy of cognitive science, and affirm the importance of physiology in understanding the mind. AESTHTI'ICS NATURATIZED Daniel Gilman, Penn State University, College of Medicine Two sets of problems typically considered within aesthetics are viewed from the standpoint of contemporary vision science. First, the subject of pictorial represen- tation is examined in light of biological and psychological theories of visual perception. It is argued that neurophysiology and computational vision science-- following David Marr--are consistent in describing strong natural constraints on viewing perspectival pictures. It is suggested that these constraints be seen as limiting possible usable systems of pictorial representation. Second, certain results from color science are applied to the question of the ambiguous critical standing of an artist's work as a colorist. In addition to these particular questions, the more general one of the role of empirical science in aesthetics is briefly discussed. WHY EPISTEMOLOGY CAN BE HISTORICIZED Anthony Graybosch, California State University, Chico A common objection to naturalism is that epistemological concepts cannot be reduced to naturalistic ones. But the naturalistic appeal to actual human reason- ing is more than a descriptive move. Natural knowledge is inherently normative and epistemic. Some philosophers object in principle to naturalizing or historici- zing epistemology. Putnam construes internalized standards of rationality as: A statement is true (rightly assertible) only if it is assertible according to the norms of modern European and American culture. Putnam notes that this claim will be false for a culture--the American, for instance--which recognizes its own relativity. It is self-refuting for such a culture, if true it is false. 73</page><page sequence="10">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 This argument need not be accepted if one does not connect justification so intimately with truth or ideal assertibility conditions. I do not seek to naturalize epistemology, because I reject the continuity of naive and scientific rationality. Instead, I seek to historicize it and retain its normative aspect. IS NATURAL THEOLOGY NECESSARY FOR THEISTIC KNOWLEDGE? John Greco, Fordham University Plantinga and Wolterstorff defend theories of justification which make it plausible that natural theology is not necessary for theistic knowledge. In parts one and two of the paper I argue that the theories defended by Plantinga and Wolterstorff are too weak. Specifically, neither philosopher accounts for a kind of epistemic praiseworthiness characterized by coherence among one's beliefs and faculties. In part three I define several important kinds of coherence, including intra-faculty coherence and coherence with one's epistemic community. Finally, I argue that once the conditions for justification are appropriately strengthened to require important kinds of coherence, it becomes plausible that natural theology is needed for theistic knowledge. SELF-DECEPTION AND BELIEF ATTRIBUTION Stephen D. Hales, Brown University In this paper I propose that our common-sense methods of belief attribution have received inadequate attention by those offering theories of self-deception. Four attribution principles are considered, and I argue that in cases of self-deception, self-deception theorists are committed to affirming two and rejecting two of these four. I also argue that said theorists are saddled with the task of explaining why they are justified in doing so. Self-deception theorists implicitly make other, more general, assumptions about belief attribution as well, and some of these are sketched and highlighted as controversial. I conclude that self-deception theorists have substantial timber to cut in attribution theory before their positions can be adequately evaluated. OPENING DOORS AND PLUGGING THE BRAIN DRAIN: THE ROLE MODEL ARGUMENT FOR FEMALE EQUITY HIRING Pamela Courtney Hall, University of Toronto With attention to the lived experience of women (i) in philosophy, and (ii) in coping with the tensions between autonomy and femininity, I develop the role model argument in partial support of the conclusion that at this point in North American history, to be female should be part of the job description for philoso- phy departments whose faculty ratios fall significantly below gender equity. I further argue for the importance of feminist philosophy as an area of specializa- tion on the basis of social concerns which universities have too long neglected. 74</page><page sequence="11">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM PLATO AND ARISTOTLE ON FRIENDSHIP Edward Halper, University of Georgia By setting Plato's treatment of friendship in the Lysis against Aristotle's account in the Nicomachean Ethics, this paper aims to show the key position of knowledge in those accounts and to challenge some current interpretations of both philoso- phers. First, I argue that the Lysis expounds two apparently contradictory requirements for friendship: reciprocity and utility. Through much of the dia- logue, Plato shows the difficulty of meeting both criteria, but his implicit aim is to show they can be met if the good is transcendent. Second, the paper explains how Aristotle thinks he can meet Plato's requirements for friendship without positing a transcendent good. Despite this difference, Aristotle too advances a triadic account of friendship that contrasts sharply with current notions. WIDE CONTENT AND MENTAL CAUSATION Barbara Hannan, University of Idaho A problem allegedly exists regarding the causal-explanatory relevance of proposi- tional content in explaining behavior, given the supposed fact that content doesn't supervene locally on physical (brain) states. This is sometimes called "the problem of mental causation." I argue that there is an important sense in which propositional content does have genuine causal relevance to action, and, in the sense in which content is causally relevant, content is in the head. In this way, I attempt to make the problem of mental causation vanish as a mere pseudo- problem. SELF-DECEPTION AND ACCEPTANCE Eugene Heath, Kenyon College Jonathan Cohen has suggested (The Dialogue of Reason, 1986; "Belief and Acceptance," Mind, July 1989) that theories of self-deception should employ the concept of "acceptance" as well as that of belief: The self-deceived person is one who believes correctly that p but accept that -p. I summarize Cohen's account of self-deception and offer a revision of one of the conditions (concealment) which, in conjunction with other conditions, would suffice for self-deception. I then argue that insofar as the self-deceiving agent must accept rather than believe his own misrepresentation of the evidence for p, the very concept of deception almost wholly disappears from Cohen's account. SUPERVENIENCE REDUX John Heil, Davidson College Philosophers bent on defending physicalism sometimes invoke supervenience in the course of explicating the relation they take to obtain between physical and nonphysical realms. In a recent paper, Richard Miller argues that appeals to supervenience on behalf of physicalism are empty; it is "trivially" true that "the 75</page><page sequence="12">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 nonphysical supervenes on the physical" ["Supervenience is a Two-Way street,", Journal of Philosophy, 87 (1990): 695-701]. Moreover, according to Miller, the supervenience relation is invariably symmetrical: When A's supervene on B's, the supervenience of B's on A's is "all but guaranteed". Together, these claims yield "the metaphysical insignificance of the supervenience relation". I argue that Miller is wrong on both counts, that his contentions hinge on an implausibly weak notion of supervenience, and that the strategy he employs, though common in debates over supervenience, is defective. READING NIETZSCHE ON FORGETTING Randall Honold, De Paul University This paper thematizes Nietzsche's discourse of forgetting found in the second Untimely Meditation, "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life." I show how his discourse suggests a way of reading his and other texts that meets the demands of thinking at the ending of metaphysics. His genealogical examination (i.e., in terms of will to power) of the roles of forgetting and memory in various conceptions of history is the focus. I suggest that Nietzsche's discourse of forgetting is neither a method to arrive at the correct interpretation of a text, nor a rendering of all interpretations as indifferent, but is a kind of reading that stays within the tension between metaphysics and the not yet/no longer metaphysical, one which brings the reader face to face with the problem of how to read Nietz- sche at the ending of metaphysics. CHURCHIAND AND ALCHEMICAL CONNECTIONISM Mark C. Hulbert, University of Oklahoma Michael Silberstein, University of Oklahoma In recent years, some of the most vocal opposition to functionalism has come from Paul Churchland. In his view, functional accounts of mind are equivalent to the accounts of matter provided by alchemy ([2], pp. 78-81). Churchland, on the other hand, advocates the approach known as "eliminative materialism" (EM), and has recently embraced the developments in connectionism (PDP) as the best way to further this project ([3], chps. 5, 7 &amp; 10, [4], pp. 35-37). In this paper we will show: 1) Churchland himself holds a form of functionalism, and 2) the connec- tionist project is open to the same objection Churchland raises against functional- ism, i.e., it is merely alchemical. TYING HEALTH CARE TO JOBS: CAN AN EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE SYSTEM BE JUST? Nancy Jecker, University of Washington This paper asks whether work place coverage is a just social instrument for protecting individuals against health care costs. Does it achieve the goal of spreading the risk of health care costs fairly between different groups in the society? To the extent that gaps exist in the present system, would mandating 76</page><page sequence="13">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM employer insurance represent a better alternative than a more radical restructur- ing of the present system? After a brief historical overview, I outline an approach for thinking about such questions. This approach considers the moral significance of linking the distribu- tion of two distinct goods. I first examine how an unjust distribution of jobs influences justice in the distribution of health insurance tied to jobs. Second, I consider whether justly awarding jobs guarantees justice in the distribution of employment-based insurance. Finally, I explore whether recent proposals to mandate employer health insurance meet standards of justice. HEI )EGGER AND ARISTOTLE'S TREATISE ON TIME Michael Kane, Boston College Though Being and Time never fulfilled its promise of a reading of Aristotle's Physics IV.10-14, Heidegger's lecture notes of the same year do offer an interpre- tation of the treatise on time. This paper examines Heidegger's interpretation, as it appears in The Basic Problems of Phenomenology. The paper first considers why Aristotle's text is so important to Heidegger. The core of the paper is concerned with Heidegger's reading and appropriation of the text. In the course of this, it treats Aristotle's treatise itself, in order to show two major departures Heidegger takes from it. These departures have to do with Aristotle's two senses of time (as limit and as number) and with the meaning of his definition of time, in particular the words kata to proteron kai husteron. Finally, the paper suggests how this reading bears on the ontological difference, upon which Heidegger hopes to base fundamental ontology. BELIEVERS PREFER TRUTH Bernard Kobes, Arizona State University We cannot conceive of believers not caring whether their beliefs are true. This claim is defended against Stephen Stich's recent argument in The Fragmentation of Reason against the value of true belief. Implications are drawn for the nature of intentional attribution. ARGUMENTS FOR THE CONNECTION PRINCIPLE Kurt Ludwig, University of Florida The connection principle (to put it crudely) holds that necessarily every mental state either is or is potentially a conscious mental state. If the connection principle is true, there are no deep unconscious mental states, that is, no mental states in principle inaccessible to consciousness. Since many cognitive science paradigms appeal to the deep unconscious in their explanations of cognitive processes, if the connection principle is true, these explanatory paradigms are incoherent. This paper criticizes not the connection principle but John Searle's recent argument for it, and offers an alternative argument to establish it. 77</page><page sequence="14">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 SOME DISCONTENTS WITH SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY Michael Malone, Northern Arizona University The paper is a critique of a portion of Steve Fuller's main argument in Philosophy of Science and Its Discontents. There is merit in Fuller's claim that the analyses of philosophers of science often presuppose a concept of the rational intellect too highly idealized to have relevance for the practicing scientist, and they tend to overlook the relationship between the individual and community. I argue, however, that Fuller's remedies urge a perspective, both on the individual scientist and the community, that is unnecessary and tendentiously cynical. Philosophy of science as currently practiced could respond to his criticisms. In fact, he takes its vocabulary and several of its strategies for granted. LOGICAL DETERMINISM AND UNSATISFYING TRUTH Richard Manning, Northwestern University This paper examines the doctrine that principles of logic alone suffice to demon- strate that all events that occur necessarily. A standard response to this doctrine-- one based on modal distinctions--is examined. It is concluded that, given classical logic, this modal response is adequate to defeat logical determinism only if the notion of truth as correspondence is abandoned. The existence of that to which a true prediction P might correspond, thus masking P true, is inconsistent with the existence of whatever would make the modal "possibly not-P" true. But then P implies necessarily P, and determinism results. Determinism may be true, but it is not logically true. Thus correspondence must be rejected. ON KNOWING HOW TO TAKE ARISTOTLE'S KOOKY OBJECTS SERIOUSLY Gareth Matthews, University of Massachusetts, Amherst Aristotle suggests that when, for example, Socrates stands up from his chair, the ephemeral object, seated Socrates, perishes, even though Socrates, himself, persists. C.J.F. Williams wants us to re-interpret Aristotle's "theory of kooky objects" so as to strip it of ontological commitment to such ephemera as seated Socrates and turn it into a purely formal account of the way singular referring phrases function in the language. I argue, to the contrary, that, whereas Aristotle's account, left as an "ontological theory," offers a creditable solution to identity puzzles that still, today, await definitive solution, turned into a purely formal or linguistic theory, it would stand impotent in the face of those puzzles. 78</page><page sequence="15">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM EXCLUSIONARY PROPERTY-BASED EVALUATION James G. Mazoue, University of New Orleans, Lakefront A Principle of Exclusionary Property-Based Evaluation (PEPBE) is analyzed and found untenable. This principle states: Only someone who is able to have experiences of some type A is competent to make evaluative judgments concern- ing A-type experiences. As it stands, PEPBE is false. A modified version of PEPBE is proposed that bases competence in making evaluative judgments in the application of standards of correctness that are justified independently of exclu- sionary properties. CONSEQUENTIALISM AND "TREATING HUMANITY AS AN END" Richard McCarty, East Carolina University Is Kant's "formula of humanity" a consequentialist categorical imperative? Arguing persuasively for "Kantian Consequentialism" (Ethics, April 1990), David Cummiskey recently concluded that the formula of humanity is best interpreted to imply that: "Conscientious Kantian agents have a basic duty ... to promote the freedom and happiness of all rational beings. In pursuit of this moral goal, it may be necessary that the interests of some give way for the sake of others." But I argue that there cannot be a consequentialist categorical imperative, since what makes an imperative categorically valid for someone also prohibits her sacrificing her freedom or existence in order to achieve any end. Elucidating Kant's claim that rational agents necessarily will their own existence as an end in every action, I show how it figures in his derivation of the formula of humanity, and how that derivation justifies "agent-centered constraints," which are essential for non- consequentialism, and incompatible with consequentialism. REVIVING CLASSICAL CONCEPTS Edward MacKinnon, California State University, Hayward Bohr's doctrine that classical concepts must play an indispensable role in any account of actual or possible experiments has been widely rejected by philoso- phers, partially because Bohr's position was radically underdeveloped. Since Bohr's primary concern is with the role of language in the unambiguous commu- nication of information, rather than with the mathematical formalism, any attempt to redevelop the Bohrian problematic should begin with ordinary language. This paper summarizes such a redevelopment. Its point of departure is Davidson's insistence on the essential uniqueness of our conceptual scheme. The way in which the core of this scheme is extended is analyzed by focusing on the linguistic residues left by historical developments in physics. The conclusion is that there is an extended ordinary language which plays a role similar to that which Bohr attributed to classical concepts. 79</page><page sequence="16">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 SOCRATES ON THE FATE OF THE SOUL Mark McPherran, University of Main, Farmington Both the Crito (54a-c) and the Gorgias (522c-527e) appear to testify to a positive Socratic faith in the immortality of the soul, a faith bolstered by Socrates' view that the soul is a precious gift of the gods (Mem. 1.4.13-14) and by his conviction that death holds nothing bad for a good person (Apology 41c-d). Not surprisingly, then, there is almost unanimous agreement that Socrates believed continued conscious life is the most likely post-mortem fate of the soul. Notwithstanding Socrates' hopes on this issue, this paper contends that this scholarly consensus is unwarranted by the evidence, and that a careful reading of the Apology's last argument (40c-41d) shows that if we must credit some sort of eschatological stance to Socrates, a qualified agnosticism is our best bet. THE NATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES Vicente Medina, Seton Hall University In this paper I am assuming that there is a moral conflict between the maximiza- tion of profit and pleasure on the one hand and the preservation and promotion of a healthy environment on the other. In light of this, I would like to explore to what extent environmental objects are valuable and whether all, or at least some of them, have intrinsic (noninstrumental) as well as extrinsic (instrumental) value. I hope my argument will clarify several issues. First, that the distinction between intrinsic and instrumental value is independent of that between "shallow" and "deep" ecology. Second, that the distinction between "shallow" and "deep" ecology is not necessarily related to the controversy about the anthropocentricity of values. And third, that the distinction between intrinsic and instrumental value is not directly related to that between the objectivity and subjectivity of values. LUCKY ACTION, INTENTIONAL ACTION, AND ACTION FOR REASONS Alfred Mele, Davidson College This paper addresses typically neglected problems that luck poses for the popular thesis that doing something for a reason suffices for doing it intentionally. The problems displayed derive from two kinds of "lucky success" in doing what one is attempting to do--one involving causal deviance, the other more straightforward. In some cases, it appears, the accidental nature of the occurrence of an action, A, that is done for a reason precludes A's having been done intentionally. Here, I argue, appearances mislead. The problems are dissolved via attention to the place of agential control in a proper understanding of intentional action and of action done for reasons. 80</page><page sequence="17">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM RIGHTS IN CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITIES Michael J. Meyer, Santa Clara University This paper addresses the question: are there rights between friends or does the adversarial nature of rights inevitably frustrate the truly mutual orientation of friendship? To suppose that there is no possible legitimate employment of rights in close-knit communities like that between friends (as is frequent among some "communitarian" thinkers) is to entertain some common, and I argue misguided, presumptions about both rights and friends. For instance, the existence of a friendship need not directly result in a flawless cooperative partnership--a kind of "preestablished harmony" between friends. One must also not presuppose (as do some "liberals") that the activity of claiming rights is not liable to any limitations. IS THERE A DUTY TO ACCEPI PUNISHMENT? Mark A. Michael, University of Nevada, Las Vegas In this paper I examine the relationship between the justifiability of engaging in an illegal action and the justifiability of escaping or refusing the punishment handed out for that act. The model that typically is employed in these cases holds that one must consider the justifiability of each of these actions in indepen- dence of one another, since there is no essential relation between the two issues; I call this the two stage model. The work that has been done in this area is dominated by this model. There is; however, an alternative which holds that there is an essential connection between these two issues, such that once one has determined that an illegal act is justified, one need do nothing more to determine that one's subsequent act of escape would be justified. I call this the one stage model, and I argue that at least with respect to a certain class of justified but illegal acts, namely those that involve the exercise of a strong right, the one stage model is more appropriate than the two stage model. IS NATURALIZED EPISTEMOLOGY FUNDAMENTALLY INCOHERENT? Eugene Mills, Virginia Commonwealth University Robert Almeder alleges that "there is something fundamentally incoherent about arguing philosophically for ... naturalized epistemology." This is because the argument for naturalized epistemology is an argument against the legitimacy of "first philosophy" and traditional epistemology. His claim seems to be that the case for naturalization uses Humean and Quinean arguments whose efficacy would be undermined if the case were established. I point out that he has not shown this, and argue that it is unlikely to be true. The argument for naturaliza- tion does not include any thesis which commits the arguer to the legitimacy of what naturalizers mean by "traditional epistemology." 81</page><page sequence="18">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 WHAT IF I WERE A MONKEY'S UNCLE? Donald P. Moor, Portland State University Conditionals whose consequents are obviously false, such as, "If Hitler was a military genius, then I'm a monkey's uncle," are thought to be ordinary language examples of material conditionals. They are thought to be such because they assert no connection between antecedent and consequent and because the point of their utterance is to emphasize the falsity of the antecedent. Problems with this view are avoided by analyzing the utterance of such conditionals as enthy- memes of the form modus tollens. If this analysis is correct, then the conditional may be an ordinary conditional rather than a material conditional. IMPERFECT ECHOES, MIS-DISQUOTATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIVITY Joseph G. Moore, Cornell University In "A Puzzle About Belief' Saul Kripke assumes a certain disquotation principle which he thinks is nearly a self-evident truth. And in his recent book, Mark Richard involves a related echo principle. In this paper, I present an example that falsifies both these principles, at least on important, theory neutral interpreta- tions of them. After presenting the example, I discuss some of its philosophical implications. First, the example and some interesting variations upon it will have to be accommodated by any fully adequate account of belief reports. Second, insofar as the example falsifies the disquotation and echo principles, it under- mines the arguments that Kripke, Richard and others have based on these principles. Third, and most importantly, I think the example casts doubt upon an attractive and popular "linguistic explanation" of the failure of substitutivity in belief reports. IS THERE ROOM FOR EPISTEMOLOGY IN AN AGE OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE? William Edward Morris, University of Cincinnati This may be the golden age of cognitive science, but it isn't the millennium. We may not be able to predict the shape of future cognitive science by extrapolating from cognitive science as we (now) know it. The Churchlands think otherwise. Their money is firmly on a particular picture of how the cognitive sciences will develop. It threatens not only folk psychology, but epistemology as well. For the Churchlands, folk psychology is a "much-muddled theory"--a degenerating research program. It should be substantially revised, or more likely, replaced outright. As goes folk psychology, so goes epistemology. What we formerly regarded as epistemology will be taken over by that part of scientific research concerned with human cognition. 82</page><page sequence="19">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM This is a bold and seemingly straightforward program. But when we step back from the rhetoric that drives it, and look at the details of what the Churchlands propose, there is much that is unclear. This essay looks critically at some central aspects of the Churchlands' program. The details have changed over time, and their case against epistemology is less precise than their rhetoric advertises. Contrary to what they claim, the Churchlands leave room for epistemology in their conception of a federated cognitive science. I briefly explore the role epistemology might play in this future federation. THE CATEGORICAL STATUS OF DIFFERENTIAE IN THE ORGANON Donald Morrison, Rice University A notorious problem for Aristotle's theory in the Categories is the categorial status of the differentia. Is e.g. the differentia of a substance-kind itself a substance; or a member of some nonsubstance category; or both; or neither? The dominant views in modern times have been that the differentia of substance is itself a substance; or that it is a quality. Against these views, this paper defends a pluralistic interpretation of differentiae. According to this interpretation, the differentia of a species is itself a member of some category, but (in principle, just insofar as it is a differentia) there is no restriction on what category it may be in. CONSTRAINTS, OPTIONS AND RIGHTS: ORDINARY MORALITY AFTER KAGAN William N. Nelson, University of Houston According to Shelly Kagan, a defense of ordinary morality against utilitarianism must explain how it is reasonable to accept both constraints and options: con- straints that prohibit promoting the most good, options to do less than the most good. Kagan's book, The Limits of Morality, relentlessly attacks both. In particu- lar, he argues convincingly against constraints based on either the doing/allowing distinction or the doctrine of double effect. In this paper, I sketch a partial account of ordinary morality in which constraints are based not on either of these distinctions, but on rights. Rights, I try to show, function very differently from these other putative constraints, and their relations both to the demands of utility and to options are complex and often subtle. But why should we accept them? The case for rights in individual morality, I argue, parallels the case for procedur- al safeguards and other limits on the power of the state in liberal political theory. It stems from a concern not with what is the right thing to do, but with whose decision it is. In a world where our ideals and beliefs in fact differ, this concern is of fundamental importance. 83</page><page sequence="20">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 HOLINESS AS SERVICE: THEREPEIA AND HYPERITIKE IN PLATO'S EUTHYPHRO David M. Parry, Pennsylvania State University, Altoona This paper argues that the despite the apparent "aporetic" result Plato's Euthyphro by Socrates' comments at 15c-d as well as 14b-c lend themselves to the view that we can infer some understanding of holiness by means of a reflection on the dialogue. This attempt takes the form of an analysis of those sections of the Euthyphro which examine the notions of holiness as man's therepeia of the gods and man's hyperetike to the gods. Although a close analysis of these sections does lead to certain correct opinions about holiness, these opinions should not be mistaken for an eidos, or for complete wisdom concerning holiness. This view allows us to understand how Socrates could deny having wisdom concerning the gods and holiness while still defending himself against the charge of impiety with the claim that his philosophical activity is a type of service to the god. STERBA ON CONTEMPORARY CONCEPTIONS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE Rodney G. Peffer, University of San Diego, Alcala Park I critically review James Sterba's description (in his recent work How to Make People Just) of what he takes to be the five major contemporary conceptions of social justice: the libertarian, welfare liberal, socialist, feminist, and communita- rian. I argue that all of his descriptions are objectionable to one degree or another and that his thesis that all of these conceptions must--given their own basic presuppositions--accept both welfare rights and rights to affirmative action is not well-founded. CONTRADICTIONS IN PLATO'S DIALOGUES Gerald A. Press, Hunter College Plato's dialogues give us genuinely contradictory information as literary docu- ments and as philosophic ones. The problem for Plato interpreters is how to make sense of them without excluding or minimizing one body of data or the other. I propose that we can do so if we give up the a priori conviction that Plato must have doctrines and a system, revise our estimate of Plato's position in the history of ancient philosophy with reference to the opposition between Heracli- teanism and Parmenideanism, and accept as an interpretive principle that the dialogues like all literary works, operate in many frames of reference in addition to the doctrinal one. THE KANTIAN SERIES ARGUMENT Richard Purtill, Western Washington University There is an argument which is widely believed to be dangerous or even fatal to a dualistic view of personal identity. In this paper I try to make sense of this argument and to find out what dualistic theory (if any) it threatens. The locus 84</page><page sequence="21">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM classius though perhaps not the original occurrence of the argument is in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason where it occurs in a footnote to one of the Paralogisms. I will be concerned with a modern use of the argument by Sydney Shoemaker. The argument itself, though quite harmless to any reasonable dualistic theory seems to me to bring out some interesting aspects of dualistic theories, and to be relevant to some general questions about the concept of a substance. AESTHETICS AND ADJUDICATION Susan Purviance, University of Toledo In A Matter of Principle, Dworkin introduces a theory of interpretation in which "the text itself is the product of interpretive judgments"; and in Law's Empire, Hercules shows us how to interpret law constructively, using the principle of integrity in adjudication. This paper focuses upon Dworkin's developing aesthetic of juridical judgment. I develop a broadly Kantian conception of the aesthetics of juridical judgment, in which there is not only correctness but excellence in judgment. It develops an account of the social and intersubjective character of adjudication and explains how adjudication is a process which makes necessary reference to the judgments of other judges. Hercules and law as integrity are each illuminated from a new standpoint. ON FOLLESDAL ON URGES AND AlTITUDES: HOW CAUSAL GENERALIZATIONS RATIONALIZE PERSONS Bjorn Ramberg, Simon Fraser University This paper is in defense of the nearly-abandoned position that a methodology of interpretation derives from the overriding goal of producing as much agreement as possible. Proceeding on the assumption that the constraints on empirical interpretation of persons are constitutive of intentional content, the argument takes off from a plausible principle of interpretation suggested by Dagfinn Follesdal. Follesdal's formulation links rationality constitutively to the mental, but allows significant scope for causal intrusions in our rationalizing explanations of mental phenomena. While accepting the indispensability of causal-psychologi- cal explanations, I offer an alternative conception of their status and function within an interpretative theory of persons. This account is compatible with a strong reading of the rationality-constraint. MODAL IDENTITIES &amp; DE RE NECESSITY Greg Ray, University of California, Berkeley I discuss one version of a puzzle about the identity of a statue with the lump of clay that composes it. The case is one in which the statue and lump agree in all their non-modal features. While this is a favorable case for the claim that they are identical, we nonetheless have discrepant intuitions about their potentialities, which appear irreconcilable. A "conservative" solution to the puzzle is offered which has the following features: i) the statue and lump of clay are identical, ii) 85</page><page sequence="22">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 our discrepant modal intuitions about the statue and lump are validated, iii) identity is necessary, and is a relation between objects, not names or concepts, iv) Leibniz's Law is not constrained, v) only a standard modal (identity) logic and semantics is needed, and vi) "provably" our modal logical intuitions are preserved. EXPLANATION: PRAGMATICS AND ASYMMETRY Alan Richardson, University of Pennsylvania In this paper I attempt to answer questions raised about the adequacy of van Fraassen's pragmatic account of explanation raised by Kitcher and Salmon. I address two principal concerns of Kitcher and Salmon: first, that van Fraassen's "Tower and Shadow" example does not answer the traditional asymmetry problem and, second, that in the absence of any restrictions on relevance relations van Fraassen's account allows of trivialization. Against the first point I argue that van Fraassen was not trying to solve the traditional asymmetry problem but that it is easy to construct examples based on his that do speak to this problem. Against the second point I argue that van Fraassen's semanticism allows him the means by which to block the trivializing relevance relations constructed by Kitcher and Salmon. I close with a brief discussion of some remaining difficulties with van Fraassen's account. A MODERATE QUOTATIONAL SOLUTION TO SUBSTITUTION PUZZLES Steven Rieber, Shaker Heights, Ohio I defend a quotational solution to some puzzles about the substitution of syn- onyms or co-referring names in attitude contexts. Unlike other quotational solutions, this one does not claim that all attitude ascriptions are quotational. It claims that only certain words (in particular, those which are non-substitutable) are quoted. This also has a big advantage over pragmatic solutions, namely that it conforms better to our linguistic intuitions. ON THE TWO EVILS OF DEATH Stephen Rosenbaum, Illinois State University Epicurus believed that death is never bad for people. Contemporary anti-Epicu- reans have argued assiduously for what apparently contradicts this idea, that death is sometimes bad for people, and their arguments have illuminated enduring human concern about death. No one seems yet to have noticed; however, that Epicurus and his recent opponents have addressed fundamentally different issues. They are concerned with two different kinds of evil. Anti-Epicureans have assumed that they have refuted Epicurus, because they think implicitly that the sense in which they have argued that death can be bad is the same as that in which Epicurus denied that death can be bad. It is not. This paper reveals that, contrary to common assumptions, the conclusions of contemporary anti-Epicurean thanatology are compatible with Epicurus's view. 86</page><page sequence="23">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM The real question is not, therefore, whether Epicurus or his recent rivals are correct. It is rather the more difficult issue of whether Epicurus's conclusion or that of his rivals is more connected with human concerns and with a relevant way of evaluating human lives. On this count, Epicurus cannot be so easily dismissed as his current critics would like. CALLICLES AND WHAT MAKES LIFE GO BEST George Rudebusch, Northern Arizona University I ignore Callicles' theories of ethics and rationality, but classify and defend his hedonistic account of self-interest to the following point: that we live well just insofar as we satisfy our affectively counterfactual desires. I argue that a further distinction, familiar in the twentieth century, between cognitively actual and counterfactual desire fails to yield a proper further classification of Callicles. And I propose an alternative distinction, between true and felt desire, which I believe better describes the issue over which Callicles and Socrates disagree. ON SEEING CLEARLY INTO THE BREAST OF ANOTHER Fay Horton Sawyier, Indiana University During his discussion of personal identity in Book One of the Treatise, Hume employs this odd expression " . .. suppose we could see clearly into the breast of another. .. ". In this paper I make explicit various ways in which this passage is indeed odd. I go on then to show that Hume's discussion of the self in Book One presupposes an adequate introspective inventory; implies the continued existence of a subject that can be affected or conditioned by events, and fails to examine the category or class of entities (i.e. persons) to which personal identity is attribut- able. From the analysis and provenance of the self in Book One, I extract a plausible concept of self, but argue that there the self is skeletal, impoverished and imper- sonal. I propose that Hume himself draws attention there to this sorry condition of selves and offers hints as to where in his work the skeleton will acquire flesh, namely in Book Two during the discussion of pride. I claim that what Hume proposes (i.e. for the flesh) is a kind of ownership concept of the self; what you own constitutes your personal "bundle." Among the ingredients in these privately owned bundles, is the way that other persons see you. Through the operation of Humean sympathy, moreover, we are not only inferentially aware of the feelings of others but immediately or directly so; we feel them ourselves. Thus finally the "seeing into the breast of another" comes to have a resonance it lacked in Book One. Puzzles within Hume's writings are always provocative. The solution to this one, at least as I conceive it, illuminates some of the important theoretical and 87</page><page sequence="24">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 structural relationships between the ending of Book One and the first part of Book Two. REJECTING THE PARETO PRINCIPLE Tal Scriven, University of Colorado, Cal Poly Tech The conflict between the Pareto principle and what Sen calls "minimal liberalism" is well-known. Generally, liberals are reluctant to simply abandon a principle as initially plausible as the Pareto principle and many have, instead, tried to find something wrong with the principle of minimal liberalism. I argue that any real liberal must accept something much stronger than minimal liberalism, that the Pareto principle conflicts with a principle even more minimal than Sen's minimal liberalism and, thus, any real liberal must reject the Pareto principle. I then go on to argue that there are very good reasons for this rejection, ones which involve certain positions that liberalism is committed to concerning the epistemology of ethics. DARWIN, DISJUNCTION, AND UNIVOCAL ASSIGNMENTS OF INTENTIONAL CONTENT Lawrence A. Shapiro, University of Pennsylvania In "A Theory of Content, I," Fodor claims the theory of evolution by natural selection will not help to save naturalistic accounts of representation from the disjunction problem. His claim depends on: (1) a presumption that naturalistic theories of content require that representational states must be causally related to what they represent; (2) an argument that the context "was selected for represent- ing things as F' is transparent to the substitution of predicates coextensive with F. Against (1) I argue that causation need not play a role in representation. Rather, a state's content can emerge from its contribution to the functioning of the system of which it is a part. Against (2) I argue that the functions we assign to the mechanisms of an organism are adaptive functions and as such are relative to categories of selection "problems." Hence, representational contexts cannot be transparent: things must be represented as solutions to these problems. ORDINARY MORALITY AND THE PROBLEM OF RATIONALITY Edward D. Sherline, University of Wyoming Central to ordinary morality are agent-centered restrictions (ACRs), restrictions that it is impermissible to violate even to minimize the overall number of such violations. Recently Samuel Scheffler has argued that ACRs are apparently irrational (the Rationality Problem) and lack an underlying principled rationale (the Justification Problem). After introducing the distinction between these two problems, I clarify the Rationality Problem. Usually this problem is construed as a conflict between ACRs and a common-sense conception of practical reason. I argue that the Rationality Problem should be conceived as involving three elements: ACRs, an account of rationality, and an account of the good. Finally, I 88</page><page sequence="25">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM examine the response of least resistance, qualifying the account of the good to eliminate the conflict, and defend this response from an objection Scheffler raises. ON AMBIGUITY IN ART: A DISCUSSION CONCERNING GOODMAN'S 'SYMPTOMS OF THE AESTHETIC' Jill Sigman, University of California, Berkeley Most works of art with widespread appeal seem to exhibit numerous tensions, contradictions, and ambiguities, which are perhaps responsible for our increased interest in these works. In this paper, I will consider ambiguity as a characteristic of works of art, particularly those works that seem to have such widespread appeal. I do not attempt to define art, or even good art, in terms of ambiguity, but rather to explore this feature of works of art and its relation to our experi- ence of them. I will begin by showing how Goodman's 'symptoms of the aes- thetic' lay an appropriate foundation for my claims about ambiguity, and then go on to consider two different ways the term 'ambiguity' might be construed. Lastly, I will ask why such tensions and ambiguities in works of art seem to appeal to us in the first place. DO WE OWE OUR FRIENDS THE TRUTH? Caroline J. Simon, Hope College As philosophers have renewed their interest in the topic of friendship, they have made many claims concerning its nature and norms. Among these is that friends have a special duty to tell each other the truth. This special duty goes beyond the general duty not to lie and is often claimed to include or entail the duty to give our friends moral advice and frank assessment. I argue that such claims cannot be adequately assessed unless one takes account of the variety of conceptions there are of friendship. I present four conceptions of friendships which are all types of relationships in which the friend is valued for his or her own sake. I then show that these conceptions differ concerning the existence and nature of a special duty to tell one's friends the truth. LEARNING AND THE DISJUNCTION PROBLEM: REPLY TO FODOR David Siren, University of California, Riverside Ken Dickey, University of California, Riverside According to causal theories of content, the semantic content of a symbol type is determined by and extends over causes of tokenings of that symbol type. Causal theories face the following Disjunction Problem. Suppose only dogs cause tokenings of 'dog.' Then every token of 'dog' must be true. Next, suppose a non-dog causes a tokening of 'dog,' e.g., a cat-on-a-dark night. Then a causal theory of content must hold either (i) the symbol 'dog' expresses a disjunctive property, viz. being either a dog or a cat-on-a-dark-night, so 89</page><page sequence="26">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 again no error occurs, or (ii) the symbol 'dog' expresses a non-disjunctive proper- ty, viz. being a dog, and the token is erroneous. Causal theorists must provide some principled reason for thinking (ii) obtains in some cases, else there is no account of error. In this paper, we contest Jerry Fodor's argument that Fred Dretske's appeal to learning situations does not help to solve the Disjunction Problem. We show Fodor's argument rests on a false dilemma, then use the basis of our objection to generate a framework for solving the Disjunction Problem within Dretske's learning situations approach. ANTHROPOMORPHISM Sarah Stebbins, Skidmore College The attributions of beliefs and desires we make to animals in the course of day-to-day contact with them are often regarded as unscientific and anthropomor- phic. I argue that there is a class of instinctual mechanisms in humans that generate spontaneous attributions of mental content to others, and that these mechanisms can be triggered by the behavior of members of other species. I argue that spontaneous attributions of content to animals through these mecha- nisms in the course of day-to-day contact are largely accurate and successfully anchor attributions of more complex content. PLATO ON TALKING PHILOSOPHY James Stephens, Hillsdale College Plato claims throughout the middle and later dialogues that dialectic proceeds by Socratic question-and-answer. Richard Robinson; however, argues in Plato's Earlier Dialectic that Plato nowhere provides justification for this claim, and that the claim leads to difficult problems which Plato nowhere resolves. Robinson concludes that we can explain Plato's commitment to the 'elenchtic' picture of philosophical inquiry only as an historical phenomenon. I argue in this paper that Plato does in fact provide good reasons for the impor- tance he attaches to question-and-answer in philosophy. I suggest that the reasons he provides anticipate, at least to some extent, recent developments in the history and philosophy of science. EPISTEMOLOGICAL NATURALISM AND NATURALISTIC EPISTEMOLOGY Matthias Steup, St. Cloud State University Epistemological naturalism attempts to locate epistemic value in the natural world by employing the a priori methodology of traditional epistemology. In contrast, naturalistic epistemology attempts to locate epistemic value in the natural world solely from within science, that is, by employing an empirical methodology. Contrary to Quine's suggestion to turn epistemology into a purely descriptive 90</page><page sequence="27">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM discipline, naturalistic epistemology retains the normative ambitions of traditional epistemology. I argue that the theories of epistemic justification set forth by Roderick Chisholm and Alvin Goldman are both versions of epistemological naturalism, but not versions of naturalistic epistemology, for both of them (i) attempt to locate epistemic value in the natural world by trying to specify the nonevaluative grounds on which epistemic status supervenes and (ii) do so by using an a priori methodology. Furthermore, I argue that there are reasons to doubt that the enterprise of naturalistic epistemology is likely to succeed. POSITIVISM, SOCIOLOGY, AND ALASDAIR MACINTYRE: NOTES ON DURKHEIM'S SUICIDE Robert Strikwerda, Indiana University at Kokomo In "Positivism, Sociology, and Practical Reasoning: Notes on Durkheim's Suicide", Alasdair MacIntyre gives an assessment--to echo Croce--of 'what is living and what is dead' in Durkheim's Suicide. His intention is "to bring out in a contempo- rary context the enduring importance of Durkheim's positivist contribution--very different in some ways from what Durkheim himself took it to be." It is a valuable analysis, but itself marred by certain historical, philosophic, and sociolog- ical errors. These, in turn, suggest that we should put more from Durkheim in the category of the viable than does MacIntyre, particularly concerning the nature of rational action and the critique of modernity. Indeed Durkheim can suggest corrections in MacIntyre. The paper closes with a brief examination of the death of Socrates. PRACTICE, INDETERMINACY AND PRIVATE LANGUAGE: WITTGENSTEIN'S DISSOLUTION OF SCEPTICISM Karsten Stueber, College of the Holy Cross Although there has been a revival of interest in Wittgenstein's philosophy in recent years, a consistent interpretation of Wittgenstein's rule-following consider- ations and his private language argument is still missing. This paper tries to remedy this situation in illustrating that the central passages of the Philosophical Investigations are arguments against the plausibility of scepticism. In describing rule following as a practice, Wittgenstein indicates the transcenden- tal status of the use of language. To overlook this transcendental dimension is the principal mistake of any form of scepticism. As Wittgenstein argues, it is inconsistent to implicitly assert the possibility of meaningful discourse and still maintain that all our theories could be false. Nevertheless, insofar as the Wittgensteinian notion of a practice has to be seen as an attempt to deny the consistency of scepticism, it does not imply that language use is necessarily a social practice. Rather, Wittgenstein's private language argument argues against the last refuge of scepticism and therefore argues only for language as an interpretable practice. 91</page><page sequence="28">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 FROM NATURAL FUNCTION TO INDETERMINATE CONTENT Sonja R. Sullivan, Rice University In his recent book, Explaining Behavior, Fred Dretske has outlined a naturalized theory of intentionality. Several philosophers, including Dretske himself, view his theory as lending credence to the claim that mental state content should be construed widely. In this paper I argue that careful analysis of his theory reveals that this view is mistaken. In Dretske's theory, the notion of the function of a state plays a central role in the determination of content. It will be my conten- tion that this notion of function cannot be used in Dretske's theory to distinguish between the wide construal of the content of an intentional state and the narrow or individualistic construal. This inability of his notion of function to discriminate between wide content and individualistic content undermines any claim that Dretske's theory endorses wide content. Instead, we are led to the conclusion that Dretske's theory entails pervasive content indeterminacy. PLATONISM IN MUSIC: A THIRD KIND OF DEFENSE Paul C.L. Tang, California State University, Long Beach Mark Peterson, California State University, Long Beach In two articles, Peter Kivy offers two different defenses of Platonism in music. We examine in some detail the arguments in his 1987 paper, "Platonism in Music: Another Kind of Defense." Kivy first defends the position that, in terms of the identity of a musical work, a Platonistic analysis, make a further distinction between essential versus accidental properties of that sound structure. Kivy also defends a Platonistic interpretation of music that construes the act of composition as discovery rather than creation, thereby accounting for certain modes of dis- course that composers themselves use. Our defense of Platonism focuses on the notion of musical form, especially that of fugue, and helps, we claim, to explain why the great composers so often resorted to fugue in order to express their highest aesthetical and musical ideas. THE RECOMBINATION PRINCIPLE AND THE DISTINCTNESS PRINCIPLE: A CRITIQUE OF ARMSTRONG Holly Gail Thomas, University of California, Santa Cruz In his recent book, A Combinatorial Theory of Possibility, David Armstrong endorses both a Humean Principle of Recombination--the claim that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences--and the claim that "the para- digms of distinct existence are those things which occupy distinct spatio-temporal locations." I argue that Armstrong must give up one or the other of these claims, because the Principle of Recombination implies that it is possible for a single individual to have more than one location. 92</page><page sequence="29">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM MUST ANTIREALIST ACCOUNTS OF VALUE BE INCOHERENT? William Throop, St. Andrew College, North Carolina Wiggins (1976), Platts (1979) and Lovibond (1983) have explored a powerful line of argument that a full-blooded antirealism with respect to the meaning of life is incoherent, that it cannot give us the kind of meaning it promises. I outline Wiggin's version of the argument and show that it rests on an unarticulated assumption about the conflict between participant and observer perspectives which is not essential to antirealism. I then sketch a pragmatist antirealism which lacks this assumption and show how it avoids Wiggins' objections. The result is a view which denies the existence of objective value, but leaves room for all of the meaning we could wish to have in our lives. ROBUSTNESS AND INTEGRATIVE SURVIVAL IN SIGNIFICANCE TESTING: THE WORLD'S CONTRIBUTION TO RATIONALITY J.D. Trout, Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University Significance testing is the primary method for establishing causal relationships in psychology. Meehl [1978, 1990a, 1990b] and Faust [1984] argue that significance tests and their interpretation are subject to actuarial and psychological biases, making continued adherence to these practices irrational, and even partially responsible for the slow progress of the "soft" areas of psychology. I contend that familiar standards of testing and literature review, along with recently developed meta-analytic techniques, are able to correct the proposed actuarial and psycho- logical biases. In particular, psychologists embrace a principle of robustness which states that real psychological effects are (1) reproducible by similar methods, (2) detectable by diverse means, and (3) able to survive theoretical integration. By contrast, spurious significant findings perish under the strain of persistent tests of their robustness. The resulting vindication of significance testing confers on the world a role in determining the rationality of a method, and also affords us an explanation for the fast progress of "hard" areas of psychology. PLATO'S COMPLEX IRONY? Jeffrey S. Turner, Bucknell University Current philosophical work on Plato's dialogues seems to be divided into two camps: those who for good or ill are often labelled "Straussians" and those who for good or ill are often labelled "Anglo-American analytical philosophers." Using the notion of "complex irony" Gregory Vlastos attributes to Socrates in his recent book Socrates, Ironist and Moral Philosopher, I propose that Plato's written work proceeds along the lines of complex irony. Plato, like his character Socrates, "does not, and yet does, mean what he says"--even (contra Vlastos) in his "middle dialogues." Thus it is quite correct to see Plato's philosophical stance as depen- dent on the dramatic elements of his dialogues, as "Straussians" insist; it is nonetheless also important to see that the irony of the dialogues is complex, not 93</page><page sequence="30">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 simple, that there is after all a "point" to his ironic strategies, a "thesis" or "posi- tion," as "analytical" interpreters insist. LOCKE, NOMINALISM AND IDENTITY William L. Uzgalis, Oregon State University The thesis of this paper is that the theory of unity and identity in II. xxvii which Locke added to the second edition of the Essay is incompatible with the nomin- alism of the Essay. The crux of the incompatibility is that Locke's nominalism requires that individuals exist prior to sorts, while is theory of individuation requires sorts for the individuation of individuals. I call this the Circle of Individ- uation and Classification. I believe the problem posed by the circle can be solved, but the solution I suggest is still incompatible with Locke's nominalism. The incompatibility between II. xxvii and Locke's nominalism shows that Locke is doing something different and I contend, more interesting in the II. xxvii than he is elsewhere in the Essay. THE IDENTITY OF CHOREOGRAPHIC WORKS Julie Van Camp, California State University, Long Beach I propose that the identity of choreographic works be understood as ways of talking and acting by the community of the danceworld. These ways of talking and acting are informed by notational systems, as well as production histories and cultural histories. But I argue here that those approaches alone have been unsatisfactory. The persuasiveness of my proposal is demonstrated by its use in the context of copyright infringement theory, which provides for the use of a written notation or fixation by a jury of lay observers which determines compli- ance with that standard. While this notation (and other factors, such as produc- tion history) informs the decision of the jury, identity (or "substantial similarity") is ultimately the decision of the jury, which functions as the community of the artworld for that particular controversy. KANT ON MORAL WORTH AND MORAL LUCK R. Jay Wallace, Pennsylvania State University Kant famously maintains that actions can have moral worth only when done from duty. Despite the extensive discussion this claim has generated, it remains problematic. One problem is to give an interpretation of acting from duty that does not make an agent's performance of a morally worthy action vulnerable to luck. Standard approaches attempt to solve this problem by making moral worth dependent on the truth of counterfactuals, about what the agent would have done in the face of obstacles to duty; but this collapses the notion of the good will into that of the heroically strong will. I argue that we can keep these notions apart by situating Kant's remarks about moral worth in the context of his account of moral 94</page><page sequence="31">APA PACIFIC DIVISION PROGRAM agency. It is the freedom of an agent's will, not its strength, that protects the moral worth of the agent's actions from the depredations of luck. LOGICS OF THE PERCEPTIUAL PROCESS Scott E. Weiner, Marist College Hegel refers to the dialectic of perception in the Phenomenology of Spirit as "this logic of the perceptual process" (#130). I explore implications of Hegel's phrase in terms of two interacting "logics," which I label "perception's logic" and the "logic of perception." One question is: what do the two interacting logics at work in the dialectic of perception indicate more generally about the operative struc- ture of the movements of consciousness in the Phenomenology? To answer, I suggest several concepts for interpreting the dialectic of perception and, more broadly, the Phenomenology in general and then present a sketch of one way of interpreting the Phenomenology. GROUP UTILITY Paul Weirich, University of Missouri, Columbia In order to extend utility theory to actions of a group of people, a utility assign- ment must be defined for the group. To be successful, the definition must make it turn out that group actions that maximize group utility are rational. I present a utilitarian definition of group utility and support it by showing that in certain bargaining problems the actions that maximize group utility according to the definition are in fact rational actions. NEO-PRAGMATIC SUPPORT FOR THE LAND ETHIC Peter Wenz, Sangamon State University Aldo Leopold's land ethic includes unusual normative claims, for example, that people should preserve such holistic entities as species, wilderness areas, and natural ecological processes because they are good in themselves. The present paper indicates how, without falling prey to unacceptable cultural relativism, the neo-pragmatic methodology of Hilary Putnam and Richard Rorty can be used to support the land ethic's claims. Support is provided by combating technological optimism and cruelty to animals, by recognizing already widespread commitment in our society to preserving many holistic entities, and by cultivating myths that favor respect for "the land." ETHICAL PROBLEMS: RETHINKING APPLIED ETHICS Carolyn Whitbeck, MIT Ethical problems are better understood as design problems than as puzzles, multiple-choice problems, or as dilemmas and other situations that throw agents into a quandary. 95</page><page sequence="32">APA PROCEEDINGS, VOL. 65, NO. 4 The development and teaching of skills for designing good responses is seriously undermined by the misrepresentation of moral problems as dilemmas and multiple-choice problems. The representation of moral problems as dilemmas frustrates problem solving and the representation of them as multiple-choice problems fails to recognize the skills and wisdom required to devise good respons- es. Not only has the nature of moral problems frequently been misunderstood and misrepresented but most of recent ethics and applied ethics has neglected the perspective of the moral agent in favor of either the perspective of a judge (casuistic approaches) or, more often, a disengaged critic who views the problem from "nowhere" and treat it as a "math problem with human beings." Not only are the possible responses not clearly defined, but the nature of the problem situation is often ambiguous for the agent. WHY EXPLANATIONS OF BEHAVIOR NEED NOT BE INDIVIDUALISTIC Rob Wilson, Cornell University Viewed as a constraint on psychological explanation, individualism is the view that psychological explanations should refer to an individual's mental state individuat- ed so as to supervene on the intrinsic, physical properties of that individual. In this paper I offer an argument against individualism based on the claim that better explanations must be both causally deeper and theoretically more appropri- ate than their competitors. In some cases, individualistic explanations of behavior are neither as deep nor as appropriate as their wide rivals. Individualism has been defended a priori by appeal to claims about the nature of causal, scientific explanation (e.g., Fodor 1987: ch. 2), and a posteriori by appeal to a working empirical hypothesis about the nature of mental processes, the computational theory of cognition (e.g., Fodor 1980, Stich 1983). If the argument of this paper is sound, we can understand why both of these influential arguments for individu- alism should be rejected. 96</page></plain_text>
