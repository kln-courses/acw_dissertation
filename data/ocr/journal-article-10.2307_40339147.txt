<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE CHARLES S. COCKELL Environmental policy has a size bias. Small organisms, such as microor- ganisms, command less attention from environmentalists than larger organisms, such as birds and large mammals. A simple thought experi- ment involving microscopic polar bears and giant microorganisms illustrates the importance of size in environmental ethics. Given the pos- itive correlation between body size and brain size, there is probably a basis for a size bias in environmental ethics using ethical frameworks based on conations. This paper examines the relevance of the size of organisms in environmental ethics. It emphasizes the need to understand the theoretical reasons for the importance of size, and not to base a size bias merely on a subjective anthropocentric prejudice favouring large organisms. I Campaigns for the protection of endangered creatures almost always focus on those that are large and impressive. The list of species whose decline or abuse has caught the attention of environmentalists includes: elephants, tigers, whales, seals, lions, turtles, polar bears, many types of birds, domesticated animals, animals used for vivisection, and so on. Evident within the history of environmental ethics and environmen- tal policy is the consistent importance of the size of organisms (Cockell 2004, 2005).

The protection of the monarch butterfly has been an on-going concern for the North American Butterfly Association, and it is an exam- ple of a small creature that has attracted the attention of environmental- ists and policy makers. In the United States, each state has a symbolic state insect, illustrating that some small organisms have value (although it is not clear what sort of 'value' mascots and state insects have to the valuer. Is this a reflection of an instrumental value - some type of compet- itiveness by each state to have a distinctive insect - or an expression of a belief in the intrinsic value of insects?). Understanding the origin of the size bias in environmental ethics is important, because it is such a pervasive characteristic of environmental thinking and practical environmental policy. If it is justified, we should try to understand why it might be justified and on what descriptive and ulti- mately, normative, ethical basis. If it is not, we should try to understand why people hold this prejudice, and what might be done to create a more balanced approach to the assessment of the relative importance of differ- ent creatures that might merit protection. Many of the existing reasons why smaller organisms are ignored are widely held views. Hargrove, in examining Passmore's suggestion that preservationists might one day wish to protect the yellow fever germ, sug- gests that: Since the yellow fever organism is far too small to be experienced aes- thetically (except perhaps by microscope), it is absurd to think that anyone could think of the beauty of such an entity in a general sense for public appreciation. (Hargrove 1989, 94) The issues I take with this view of microorganisms (which is not a criti- cism of Hargrove - it is a common view of microorganisms) are numerous. First, the yellow fever germ is a distraction from the vast num- ber of species of microorganisms that do not harm humans. I have previously drawn the parallel that using disease-causing microorganisms as the basis of an ethical debate about the value of micro-organisms is akin to using man-eating tigers as the basis of discussions about whether we should preserve tigers (Cockell 2004). The lethal varieties are a tiny subset of all microorganisms. Focus on them distorts the argument by cre- ating a negative view in the mind of the reader, and thus subjectively skewing the ethical argument.</page><page sequence="3">Second, it is not always the case that microorganisms cannot be aes- thetically appreciated on macroscopic scales. The beautiful yellows, reds, greens and browns of the microbial mats, for instance, that live in the hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA are arguably as stunning as a tiger. Most people think that tigers are beautiful, even though they may never have actually seen one. They base their view of the beauty of the animal on photographs, television, and perhaps, more rarely, on accounts from people who have seen them. So too, it is not unreasonable to expect that people could learn the beauty of microorgan- isms based on photographs, television images and perhaps, more rarely, on accounts from microbiologists who have seen them. But finally, even this argument may be irrelevant, because, as I shall discuss at greater length later, beauty should not be the basis of an assess- ment of moral relevance. Ignoring microorganisms in environmental ethics because most peo- ple cannot directly see them cannot be a justification for a size bias in ethics (although it might well be part of the cause of it). Similarly, we can- not exclude other small organisms, such as many insects and crustaceans because they are difficult to see, or do not project aesthetic qualities on 'obvious' macroscopic scales. Such an approach would be to locate the value of life on Earth as merely objects of public display. II We can probe the origin of the view that size is important in environ- mental ethics by conducting a simple thought experiment. Consider a world where two ecological attributes are very different from the world with which we are familiar. First, the world is populated by polar bears that are microscopic. These polar bears are found in many different habi- tats, but they particularly like to live in soils, in rocks, and they are often to be found in the oceans. The bears are about one micron in size (one thousandth of a millimetre), and they possess all the attributes of polar bears with which you and I are familiar. The polar bears are numerous. There can be many billions of them in just one bucket of soil, and they are distributed in different habitats globally. If you had a microscope, you could view these polar bears for yourself. Under the microscope they have four legs, they roar (although you have to keep very quiet to hear them) and they have fur. They roam around on a microscope slide in their microscopic world. CHARLES S. COCKELL ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE 25</page><page sequence="4">In this alternative world the second difference is that the microbes are the size of dogs. It is not atypical for just a few of them to live in a pond. They live in a wide diversity of habitats, but where they do live, their size means that only a few can be supported by the available food. I stress that apart from their size in all other respects these bears and microbes are identical to the ones with which we are familiar. The polar bears are multi-cellular, but their cells are tiny; the microbes are essen- tially large bags of water and they are single-celled. They have the same conations, behaviours, and methods of reproduction and growth that we find in the bears and microbes that we all know (this is obviously physi- ologically implausible, but this is an ethical thought experiment, not a description of a proposed real biological world). Now consider the likely place that these creatures would have within the environmental ethics of this alternative world. Ponder the draining of a one square kilometer habitat. This habitat is biologically diverse and it will be drained to make way for a new shopping and housing develop- ment. In the process of being dried out, many billions of polar bears will be killed. During this project, a rare species of dog-sized microbe is likely to go extinct. The destruction of the habitat has enraged the local envi- ronmental community. But what is it that concerns them? Do the polar bears or the microbes attract the attention of this environmental commu- nity? Ill Consider this perspective from the final paragraph of Jennings's sem- inal work published in 1904 on the behavior of microorganisms, in which he describes in detail the reaction of a diversity of microbes to numerous stimuli: This work has shown that in these creatures the behavior is not as a rule on the tropism plan - a set-forced, method of reacting to each par- ticular agent - but takes place in a much more flexible, less directly machine-like way, by the method of trial and error. This method involves many of the fundamental qualities which we find in the behavior of higher animals.... This method leads upwards, offering at every point opportunity for development, and showing even in the uni- cellular organisms what must be considered the beginnings of intelligence and of many other qualities found in higher animals. (Jen- nings 1904, 252) 26 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 13(1) 2008</page><page sequence="5">Jennings roots his view that microorganisms possess attributes of intelli- gence not entirely on an arbitrary subjective feeling, but rather on an earlier discussion by Lloyd Morgan on the definition of intelligence, which includes the ability to use trial and error to respond to the environ- ment (Morgan 1900). But even if we decide that microorganisms are not 'intelligent', Jen- nings does not let us off the hook that easily. After many observations of the reactions of amoebae to various stimuli such as heat, Jennings sees many intermediate states in these organisms. The complexity of the responses and the way in which amoebae develop specific physiological 'states' leads him to conclude that "possibly a case could be made out, on the other hand, for a physiological state corresponding to that which con- ditions pleasure in ourselves" (his italics) (Jennings 1904, 249). In the same work, he draws similar parallels between the response of microorganisms to negative stimuli and physiological states of 'pain' in higher organisms: But to attempt to deal with the problem of negative reactions in the lower organisms without recognizing that they are conditioned in the same way as the negative reactions of man - without admitting the existence of some physiological state analogous to that which is accompanied by pain in man, is, I believe, to close one's eyes to patent realities. (Jennings 1904, 249) His view that microorganisms exhibit responses of pleasure and pain, if accepted, would bring them within the purview of even the most ardent utilitarian such as Singer, and we really would be demanding microbial liberation. Microbes do not possess attributes of sentientism and conation on par with many higher organisms and their ability to experience pleasure and pain might be considered doubtful, even though they seem to exhibit some of the rudimentary qualities of later developments in this direction, as Jennings recognized. They exhibit responses to the environment much more complex than is usually assumed by both the public and ethicists (Cockell 2005). Nevertheless, we must accept that their lack of a central nervous sys- tem connected to a brain limits the extent to which microorganisms can feel 'pain' or 'pleasure' rather than merely responding to stimuli, no mat- ter how complex we might consider their behaviour to be. Similarly, CHARLES S. COCKELL ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE 27</page><page sequence="6">insects, arachnids, and crustaceans lack the neurological complexity of larger animals such as mammals. The diversity of neurological solutions to information processing in organisms creates a large standard deviation in the responses of differ- ently sized organisms to stimuli that might be expected to induce states of 'pleasure' and 'pain.' But as a generalization, the attributes of conation become less complex the smaller the organism becomes. As the size of organisms from blue whales to microbes spans about eight orders of mag- nitude, then at least at the resolution of each two orders of magnitude step we can say as a general rule that organisms become less conative the smaller they become. This assertion is based on empirical evidence. It has been known for a long time that brain size is related to body size by a three-fourths power law (Martin 1981, Smirnov 2002). As the mass of neural tissue within a brain is generally related to its processing power, then it follows that large body size equates to greater processing power. However, the situation is not that simple because in many species, such as humans, brain size is dis- proportionately large compared to other species with a comparable body size (a notion generally referred to as 'encephalisation,' which is a meas- ure of brain size corrected for body mass). Jerison, in his work on the brain, accepted that the data did not fit along a perfectly straight line because of encephalisation effects, but the correlation is nevertheless quite robust - larger animals have larger brains (Jerison 1973). In the case of insects and microbes there is clearly no 'brain,' at least in the sense of an encephalized central mass of processing tissue, but they generally lie at the lower end of 'processing power,' consistent with what we would expect from their body size. What are the implications of these biological realities for environ- mental ethics? If we were to base an environmental ethic on the complexity of conations and the various degrees of its manifestation, then we would have, at least in the most generalized way, an empirical basis for an important role for size in ethics. Existing ethical frameworks that would allow for a conation-based size bias might include Gary Varner's version of biocentric individualism in which he suggests that differences in the treatment of organisms can be derived from their possession of 'ground projects,' 'non-categorical desires,' and 'biological interests,' each one of these representing succes- 28 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 13(1) 2008</page><page sequence="7">sively less complex manifestations of behaviour (Varner 2002). Donald VanDeVeer likewise posits a form of 'interspecific justice' that allows for an inegalitarian view of intrinsic value (VanDeVeer 1979). Similarly, James Sturba advocates 'biocentric pluralism' (Sturba 1995). He does not link his theory directly to conations, but nevertheless suggests that there is a hierarchy in value that allows humans to override the value of other organisms within an otherwise biocentric approach to environmental ethics. Ethical theories that hold that all organisms merit equal value, for example Taylor's 'Respect for Nature,' do not allow an important role for size because brain size and its influence on behaviour is not important in the ethical debate (Taylor 1989). In these theories all organisms merit equal moral status regardless of conative abilities, and thus size. Con- versely, ethicists such as Singer, Kant, or Regan that hold that sentiency, rationality, or being the 'subject-of-a-life' is the basis of moral relevance, respectively, might regard size to be irrelevant in small life forms because they do not view them to have moral relevance in the first place (Singer 1975; Regan 1983; Kant 2004). As larger life forms are more likely to be sentient or the 'subjects-of- a-life' than smaller ones, Singer, Regan, and ethicists with similar sentience criteria for moral relevance would generally consider larger organisms to be more meritorious of moral consideration. Furthermore, for those organisms that are morally relevant (i.e. sentient), examination of their moral significance (Singer and Regan support equality in terms of moral consideration, but not necessarily moral significance) would tend to give preference to large organisms over smaller sentient organisms on account of the fact that larger ones generally have more potentiality in life that is likely to be frustrated by their demise - size may be important for both moral considerability and moral significance. Thus, size is important in environmental ethics because conative capacities have played an enormously important role in different ethical frameworks and thus, depending on the viewpoint of the ethicist (or member of the public), size is important as an indirect result of where the line of moral considerability is drawn and how moral significance is determined. CHARLES S. COCKELL ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE 29</page><page sequence="8">IV In my imaginary world, the microscopic polar bears are very numer- ous and the giant microbes are much rarer. In the real world as well, the abundance or population density of organisms is, broadly, correlated to body size. This relationship, known as Damuth's law, suggests that the population density decreases with increasing body size as a three fourths power law (Damuth 1981, 1991). Thus, for example, a reptile with a body 16 times greater than another reptile will have a population density one eighth the size. Damuth's law has many simplifications, some of which have been addressed by Gaston and Blackburn (1995). Scientists tend to study organisms that are abundant and easy to track down, thus skewing the population density measurements for many species that are reported in the literature. Population density and body size are also varied by diet, migration patterns, and reproductive strategies, so a simple mathematical relationship, such as a well-defined power law, is inadequate. The power law will vary according to the taxa being discussed, so that we cannot apply it to all life on Earth. Damuth's law, however, derives from a general trend that does seem valid - the larger the organism, the fewer there are. As well as having importance in ecology, rarity has an importance in ethics. Something that is rare is often cherished more than something that is not. If Leonardo da Vinci had painted fifteen Mona Lisa's, or if Monsieur Eiffel had built fif- teen identical towers, I doubt we would be as concerned about damaging one of them as we would be with damaging the unique object. If we think that value correlates to abundance then in some way Damuth's law has ethical implications. Callicott avers that "the preciousness of individual deer, as of any other specimen, is inversely proportional to the population of the species" (Callicott 1989, 27). His discussion is a response to Edward Abbey's observation that we might rather kill a person than a snake, on account of the growing human population that has become more expansive than the population of many snakes, some of which are in decline. There is a difference, however, between agreeing that the population of a species is too large, and the value that we hold an individual to have. I can agree that the human population is too large and we should find ways to lower our numbers, but I do not value my nieces and nephews 30 ETHICS &amp;&gt; THE ENVIRONMENT, 13(1) 2008</page><page sequence="9">less when I find out that the human population is 6 billion rather than 4 billion. This observation on population size has no influence on the way in which I value them. I value them for their intrinsic value as human beings (in addition to the kinship I feel for them). Elliott Sober, in a description of this ethical conundrum, observes: But for an environmentalist, this holistic property - membership in an endangered species - makes all the difference in the world: a world with n sperm and m blue whales is far better than a world with n + m sperm and 0 blue whales. Here we have a stark contrast between an ethic in which it is the life situation of individuals that matters, and an ethic in which the stability and diversity of populations of individuals are what matter. (Sober 1986) However, as Sober and many other environmental ethicists have understood, rarity as the basis for a practical environmental ethic has many problems. Imagine, for example, there are one thousand lions left in Africa. One of these, let us call her Harriet for illustration, lives in the Kruger National Park. Now let us assume we begin to kill off the other lions one at a time - does this mean that we value Harriet more and more? From a practical point of view we might do, as we begin to realise that lions are getting closer to extinction. In some sense we 'wake up' to Harriet's value and the value of all lions. But for many ethical positions this is erroneous, because we either value Harriet in her own right, or we don't. For example, we might value her in a way consistent with Good- paster's ethic (Goodpaster 1978) - because she is simply alive, or within the framework of an ethic described by Callicott (Callicott 1986) - we have empathy for her, or in any other way in which we defend the moral consideration of organisms. The application of such a position to human individuals, for instance, would be egregious. Consider the somewhat macabre thought experiment of having two children, one of whom tragically dies. You then inform your remaining child that you value them much more because they are a rarer child than they were previously. Surely such a view of your children would be morally intolerable, not least wrong, as you should value your children in their own right? (We might well value them more for the simple reason that we have one child left and we are shocked into the realization that an accident has deprived us of a child, but the ethical basis of this added sense of value, I suggest, is wrong). "~m-m~*'~mma^^ ETHICS" AND SIZE 31</page><page sequence="10">For Singer, the concern about the preferential treatment of endan- gered species turns on the problem that it encourages us to protect them because of their rarity, whilst forgetting their sentiency. Using whales again, he observes that if certain whales are protected and become more common, they might be hunted again because they are no longer rare, but the hunting is not acceptable, as it still represents the killing of a sentient animal (Singer 1979). Alastair S. Gunn points out the importance of rarity for people with certain hobbies and interests - stamp collectors hunt down rare stamps and bird watchers take great pleasure in seeing rare birds - he sees rarity as an intensifier of value (Gunn 1984). However, it must be incorrect from an ethical standpoint, quite apart from being dangerous, to see rar- ity as an intensifier of value, as this position would suggest that it would be beneficial to make something rare so that people could enjoy the rar- ity of the remaining few. Consider the response of an individual, such as the remaining child in my sibling tragedy analogy, at the receiving end of an ethic that tells them they are worth more because their sibling has died. In more ruthless individuals it might even encourage murder as a means to increase their own value. It is the case that rarity is an intensifier of value, in the sense that there is an abundance of empirical evidence that people value some things that are rare more than things that are common. In the case of the Mona Lisa and the Eiffel Tower, these objects do not have conations or interests, so it seems reasonable that people should derive some sense of enjoyment from seeing something so rare. The experience is something that they can recount to their friends - it is a good topic of conversation. But this is not a way to treat living things if we hold that they do have moral relevance. Their value is not linked to the rarity or abundance of other similar crea- tures. The notion that rare species have greater value than common ones is a position that might be held by ethicists that view individuals and species as having purely instrumental value - the closer a species comes to extinc- tion, the less use we are likely to be able to derive from it. Similarly, such a position, for certain taxa of organisms, could be adopted by an ethicist that holds some species to have intrinsic value, but others not. If you believe, for example, that sentience is the basis for moral consideration, then species which do not exhibit this characteristic, such as, for example, 32 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 13(1) 2008</page><page sequence="11">microorganisms, might be more valuable the rarer they become only because of the possible loss of their instrumental value. If they have no instrumental value, the size of their populations might be completely irrel- evant. Ethical viewpoints that value certain individuals in themselves (either all individuals, such as Taylor's formulation, or those that possess sen- tiency or are the subject-of-a-life, for example), would value them irrespective of how many other individuals there are. Ethical viewpoints that did not value individual organisms, i.e. where certain groups of organisms fall outside the definition for having moral relevance, would assert no importance of size for individuals since they are not morally rel- evant in the first place. Despite the varied ways in which abundance, and thus size, might find its way into ethical debate, there might be good practical reasons for such a bias. The larger the population size of an organism, the less likely it is that variations in the population size will result in extinction. Organ- isms with very small population sizes are more likely to succumb to extinction if their population size is forced below the minimum viable population by, for example, disease. Our view that large animals should be protected could therefore be based on the fact that their population sizes are more vulnerable. In other words, abundance should not in itself influence the degree to which an individual has value or not, but it may well be important in our policy decisions towards populations and species, where abundance clearly does have implications for their likeli- hood of extinction, which in itself effects the likelihood of the extinction of individuals. Thus, we could argue that we value an individual more when it is rarer because its rarity suggests that the population may be get- ting close to a minimum viable population, which itself will threaten the existence of the individual under consideration. In this case, we have a clear basis for a size bias in environmental ethics that relates to abun- dance, and can be located at the level of the individual. Of course, the preceding discussion rests on the assertion that we actually care about species getting close to extinction, which, for the purposes of this paper, I have assumed to be the case, although this is a separate subject of debate. V It is likely that a powerful influence on the size bias in environmen- CHARLES s. COCKELL ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE 33</page><page sequence="12">tal ethics is the simple impracticality of protecting some small creatures. Microorganisms possess the important characteristic that, at least on an individual level, it is usually impossible to protect them, as we kill them on a day-to-day basis while living our lives. You can avoid walking on a dog, but you cannot avoid every bacterium. In this case, clearly size does matter. Being microscopic makes it impossible for size not to matter, whatever ethical position you might adopt. As organisms become larger, for example as we move to insects and small crustaceans, we transition into the realms where everyday practical protection becomes possible. Flies, for instance, can be let out of the house rather than killed, but we unavoidably kill many of them flying commercial airliners, or even driving our cars. They represent a class of organisms in a decreasingly grey area where the number of instances in which we can protect them increases as size increases. Eventually, we reach creatures such as elephants, where there are really no instances in which we unavoidably kill them. From a practical point of view then, size matters because the larger something becomes the more practical it becomes for us to take care not to injure or kill it. This is a situation derived purely from practical con- siderations, but it might provide some explanation for the fact that large organisms have attracted the attention of environmentalists. In this instance size matters because it impinges directly on our ability to imple- ment practical environmental policy. Constructing environmental campaigns for the protection of organ- isms that can be easily macroscopically appreciated is certainly easier. However, because something is difficult to protect does not provide a suf- ficient reason to completely ignore it. Perhaps in some instances it is difficult to protect because we have not spent sufficient time working out how to protect it, or perhaps we need to change our treatment of certain environments to make it easier to protect. VI There is another cause of the size bias that is undeniably important in environmental policy. Probably size in itself is influential because larger animals project more anthropomorphic features that trigger empathy in us, and that draw us to their protection. The sense of kinship we feel with other humans can be translated into a sense of kinship with other animals 34 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 13(1) 2008</page><page sequence="13">if we see expressions on their faces and features that remind us of humans or children, a potent example being baby seals, which have human child- like facial features. This might sound a cynical view of the objective ability of the public to make robust environmental judgements, but one only has to listen to the views of people who have seen the killing of lions or seals on television to know that a visual connection with animals that display anthropomorphic characteristics certainly does play a part in the emotional draw people have towards the protection of larger animals. Buried within the anthropomorphic interpretation is our empathy with things that we perceive to be 'beautiful.' It is not my purpose to try to define what is beautiful or ugly to us and why. However, many of the organisms we protect do display features that we perceive to be beautiful within an anthropocentric sense of 'beauty.' Michael Ohrbach has referred to this as the 'cuddly quotient,' although its unquantifiable nature perhaps means that the term 'quotient' gives it too much credibility. Par- tridge's 'aw gawsh' factor, although more informal, sets the appropriate tone (Partridge 1984). In a recent television documentary on the protection of crocodiles, one of the participants explained that although crocodiles were ugly, they raised young and had families like we do, and therefore they merited our protection. The line of reasoning being that because they were ugly one would be forgiven for not caring about them, but because they have fea- tures such as caring about their young that are familiar to us, we should let them off the hook of their ugliness and protect them. Ugly and horri- ble, but they are worthy of protection because they have behaviour similar to us - a double whammy of human arrogance. The notion that beauty plays a role in our sense of value is supported by the small organisms that we do protect. The monarch butterflies, which I mentioned in the introduction, are small, but they are stunning. Many spiders command no such attention, but some of their habitats are threatened. Butterflies suggest that beauty can save you from the size bias. There is no clear separation between the notion of 'beauty' and anthropomorphism. They are two complex phenomena intertwined. Sometimes we feel empathy for ugly people and things out of a sense of love for the unloved - the elephant man, for instance. The way in which these emotions interact and provide a sense that an animal needs protec- tion is not predictable, or even rational. However, anthropomorphism, CHARLES S. COCKELL ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE 35</page><page sequence="14">beauty, and sometimes overt ugliness do play a role in our empathy for other creatures. In the sense that playing on these emotions is the clearest way of engaging the public in environmental conservation, and particu- larly those people that have the money to make environmental conservation possible, it is undeniable that these emotions are used to make progress. However, constructing a robust environmental ethic on arbitrary decisions based on beauty and anthropomorphism will lead to the oversight of many organisms that might turn out to be critical for the health of the biosphere. It cannot be the basis of an environmental ethic, even if now and then we choose to use it for the pragmatic needs of rais- ing public awareness and support. VII I have explored just some of the complexities of size in environmen- tal ethics. For a number of reasons, size does matter in environmental policy, and it is, of course, dependent on the ethical theory that is adopted. But size, in itself, should not matter at the theoretical level. There is no ethical basis for a difference in moral relevance due to organ- isms based on their size alone. Size matters because it usually implies other biological attributes that do have a bearing on theories of moral consideration and significance. Two of these attributes, abundance and complexity of conative characteristics, certainly have been the basis for previous ethical divisions. The strongest foundation for the importance of size in environmental ethics is the broad correlation between size and attributes of conation. In that large organisms exhibit complex behaviors, response to pleasure and pain, etc., then any environmental ethic that asserts that different levels of conation have a bearing on moral relevance will invariably result in larger organisms being protected to the exclusion of smaller organisms. However, the approach is clearly not foolproof. Some octopuses are small (the size of a human hand), but seem to possess many more attrib- utes of conation and sentiency than a large clam that might be considerably larger than your hand. A large fungus such as the honey mushroom, which can cover an area equivalent to over a thousand foot- ball fields, has fewer attributes of conation than a baby elephant - though the fungus is not sentient. So we cannot propose that size could be applied consistently as a measure of moral relevance in ethics where conations and sentiency are important. 36 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 13(1) 2008</page><page sequence="15">From a purely practical point of view, size, in itself, might have some bearing on environmental policy because larger organisms are simply eas- ier to look after and protect, but we should not translate this into a principle. We should try to protect any organisms if we hold them to be worthy of protection based on a properly developed environmental ethic. The protection of large animals because they are less abundant is not an acceptable basis of a size bias when applied to individuals. If we hold an organism to have value then we cannot hold that its value correlates to how many others exist that are similar to it. However, when applied to a concern about extinction, large body size generally implies a smaller population, and perhaps greater potential for extinction. Thus, there may be practical reasons for a size bias, which would manifest as the protec- tion of individuals. Like an ethic based on conations, however, the measure is not foolproof. There are many examples of tiny plants and insects on the brink of extinction. The most powerful reason for a size bias in environmental ethics is the anthropomorphic features and beauty exhibited by large animals. This may be useful to engage public debate and support for environmen- tal conservation - and it undoubtedly works - but it is weak ethically as a basis for environmental policy. In my imaginary world it is not clear who gets the benefit of the doubt in the environmental debate. The microbes are large and more prone to extinction because of their small population size, and they might attract concern. However, no doubt many people would find the giant bags of water with revolving tails revolting to look at (although some people, including microbiologists, might find them beautiful and quite spectacular). Many people might find their ugliness a reason to ignore them. In addition, they are not sentient and they would fall outside the boundaries of many modern theories of environmental ethics. By contrast, the polar bears are small and they are not rare, but they are still beautiful and maybe, like the butterflies, this will save them. They are sentient and thus they would merit importance in many modern the- ories of environmental ethics. Like humans, their sentiency would make them individually morally significant, even despite their large population. Like microorganisms though, they are so small and numerous it may be practically impossible to protect individuals and for this reason they may be ignored. The lack of clarity about the conflicting considerations applied to the CHARLES S. COCKELL ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS AND SIZE 37</page><page sequence="16">miniature polar bears and giant microbes shows how opaque the ethics of size is in our real world. My concern is not necessarily that small creatures, such as microbes, often command less attention than large creatures, such as polar bears. The concern is that the usual reason for the difference is prejudice. Size clearly does matter in practical environmental conservation, but we must know why small creatures are less morally significant - if indeed they are.
