<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SHAFTESBURY IN ENGLISH SPECULATION It has been repeatedly pointed out that Shaftesbury de- rived many, if not the most, of his philosophical ideas from his immediate and more remote predecessors. Nevertheless, the recognition of this fact does not detract from the origi- nality and power of Shaftesbury himself. The ideas gleaned from a wide reading and companionship passed through the medium of his keen and generous mind and emerged a new intellectual compound. It will be remembered that as a lad of seven the precocious Ashley could read Latin and Greek with ease. Little wonder it is, therefore, that we find him extremely familiar with the doctrines of the principal ancients. Park, in speaking of his "real system and opinions," remarks that "they may be proved in every part to be in fact no other than the concurring sentiments of the best writers among the ancients."' Similarly Toland observed: "Perhaps no modern ever turned the Ancients into sap and blood, as they say, than he. Their doctrines he understood as well as themselves, and their virtues he practiced better."2 A remark in his life in the General Dictionary is illuminating in this connection. "Among the writers that he admired, and carried always with him, were the moral works of Xenophon, Horace, the Commentaries and Enchiridion of Epictetus as published by Arrian, and Marcus Antoninus. These authors are now extant in his library, filled throughout with marginal notes, references, and explanations, all written with his own hand." Strangely this list omits the one ancient to whom he undoubtedly owed most, namely Plato. Warburton, having paid him the compliment of "many excellent qualities, both as a man and as a writer," con- tinues: "In his writings he hath shown how largely he hath I Walpole, Royal and Noble Authors, London, 1806, IV, 55. 2 Introduction to Letters from the Late Earl of Shaftesbury to Robert Molesworth, Esq., 1721. 175</page><page sequence="2">176 WILLIAM E. ALDERMAN imbibed the deep sense, and how naturally he could copy the gracious manner of Plato."3 His relationship to the Cambridge Platonists4 is also noteworthy, his first venture into print being the Preface to the Sermons of Dr. Whichcote, one of their number. Striking similarities are also found in Cudworth and Cumberland., A less common view is that of Roberston, who admitting some of the ideas of Shaftesbury to be similar, unconsciously, to those of Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae, some similar to those in the ethic of the ancients-Platonic, Stoic, and Epicurean,-and others like to those in Charron and Locke, builds up an elaborate parallelism between Spinoza and the Third Earl.6 This "novel view" is "unconvincing"7 when it is accompanied by the admission that Shaftesbury may not have learned of Spinoza until a date as late as 1698. Again, though the similarity between the doctrines of Leib- nitz's Theodicge and The Moralists (1709) is striking, the former did not appear until 1710. Shaftesbury seems to have written rather to controvert current opinions and practices than to enunciate wholly new ideas on obscure subjects. The Letter concerning Enthu- siasm (1708) and the Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humor (1709) were directed against the actual practices of the French Prophets. Warton makes The Moralists (1709) "a direct confutation of the opinions of Bayle" with whom he "had many conversations and disputes . . . on the Manichaen controversy."8 All of his ethical and theological teachings have an immediate historical significance.

Deferring for the present any elaborate discussion of Shaftesbury's doctrines, we can hint at his ethical moment by epitomizing the salient points of the philosophy of Hobbes and Locke. To the former the state of nature was a state of war. In the beginning there was a constant clash of opinion and de- sire. So long as men relatively equal to each other in body and mind stood opposed there could be no progress; con- sequently a supreme power with authority was set up as a necessary expedient. Thus "civil society is based on a con- tract." "Justice is the keeping of valid covenants, in- justice the non-performance of them." But the covenants, it must be remembered, are man-made, the results of man's own desires,-and they are right. This makes the individual inclination the ethical norm, and exalts pure self-interest to a place of legitimate authority. Conscience of divine guidance in the orthodox sense passes away, and in its place is set up a purely empirical guide, synonymous with desire, interest, and custom. This egoistic philosophy was especially obnoxious to the virtue-loving, optimistic Shaftes- bury. Although he skilfully avoids personal mention of Hobbes in his works, the implications are obvious. The reference is apparent when he says, "'Tis ridiculous to say that there is any obligation on man to act sociably or honestly in a formal government, and not in that which is commonly called the state of nature. . . . Thus faith, justice, honesty, and virtue, must have been as early as the state of nature, or they could never have been at all. The civil union, or confederacy, could never make right or wrong, if they sub- sisted not before."9 And again he brands as "extraordinary" that "known way of reasoning on self-interest" which would lead us to suppress "kindness of every sort, indulgence, tenderness, compassion, and, in short, all natural affection 9 Sesus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humor, Part III, section 1.</page><page sequence="4">178 WILLIAM E. ALDERMAN . . . that by this means there might be nothing remaining in us which was contrary to a direct self-end."10 To Shaftes- bury morality was not a human makeshift but a perfectible endowment. Right and evil were not equivalent to personal whims, but were eternal and immutable by the very nature of the universe. Not the individual, but the general good was the aim of virtue; not the accomplishment of human desire with its accompanying satisfaction, but an internal consciousness of harmony with the universe was the coveted reward. With Locke, whom he styles his "friend and foster-father" and whom he credits with having had "absolute direction of my education," we should expect to find Shaftesbury more in harmony; but such is hardly the case. Although he respects him as a man, and admits that "No one had done more towards the recalling of philosophy from barbarity into use and practice in the world," and although he pays him the compliment of having "opened a clearer and better way to reason" than any one else,1' he takes exception to his ethical principles. The burden of Locke's ethic was that "the true ground of morality can only be the Will and Law of God, who sees men in the dark, has in his hands rewards and punishments, and power enough to call to account the proudest offender."'12 This "Rule prescribed by God is the true and only measure of virtue." Apropos of this doctrine, Shaftesbury warns young Ainsworth that "'Twas Locke that struck at all fundamentals, threw all order and virtue out of the world, and made the very ideas of these (which are the same as those of God) unnatural, and without foundation in our minds."''3 "If the mere will, decree, or law of God be said absolutely to constitute right and wrong, then are these 10 Inquiry concerning Virtue, Bk.

For thus, if each part of a contradiction were affirmed for truth by the Supreme Power, they would consequently become true."'14 "So that to bid me judge authority by morals, whilst the rule of morals is supposed dependent on mere authority and will, is the same in reality as to bid me see with my eyes shut, measure with- out a standard, and count without arithmetic."'5 "They who live under tyranny, and have learnt to admire its power as sacred and divine, are debauched as much in their religion as in their morals. Public good, according to their appre- hension, is as little the measure or rule of government in the universe as in the state. They have scarce a notion of what is good or just, other than as mere will and power have determined. Omnipotence, they think, would hardly be itself, were it not at liberty to dispense with the laws of equity, and change at pleasure the standard of moral recti- tude."'6 Both Shaftesbury and Locke were in accord, and opposed to Hobbes, in their contention that public good rather than private interest was the criterion of right action; but they were widely opposed to each other, and each in turn to Hobbes, in accounting for the origin of the moral guide. Hobbes held it to be a manufactured expedient, the result of experimentation and contract; Locke made it synonymous with the "Law and Will of God," ascertainable by the exercise of reason; Shaftesbury regarded it as a delicate, innate sense, as intuitive and as operative as man's sense of Beauty. Hobbes made personal pleasure the incentive to conformity; Locke placed stress on public opinion and the fear of punish- ment and the hope of reward; Shaftesbury believed virtue to be its own reward. Hobbes and Shaftesbury agree in trans- ferring the criterion of morality from the Supreme Will to the man himself, and in so doing made a valuable contribu- tion to the science of ethics. Shaftesbury, however, went far 14 Inquiry concerning Virtue, Pt. III, section 1. 15 Advice to an Author, Pt. III, section 1. 1" Freedom of Wit and Humor, Pt. III, section 1.</page><page sequence="6">180 WILLIAM E. ALDERMAN beyond either of his opponents in giving dignity to the virtues, in that he made God himself subject to their stand- ards. "For whoever thinks there is a God, and pretends formally to believe that he is just and good, must suppose that there is independently such a thing as justice and in- justice, truth and falsehood, right and wrong, according to which he pronounces that God is just, righteous, and true."''7 This rejection of "the Will and Law of God" as the measure of moral fitness leads us logically to another related matter in which Shaftesbury stands apart from the orthodoxy of his times. His theology and his ethics are so closely interwoven and interdependent, however, that it is difficult to discuss the one without trespassing upon the other. The strict orthodoxy of the Commonwealth never questioned the anthropomorphic Deity. The Supreme One was judge and jury, capable of indignation, anger, wrath, and arbitrary decisions. Milton's vain, autocratic God is not an unfair example of the current conception of the Maker and Ruler of all. The will of the judicator constituted the right, and conformity to his dictates was the acme of virtue. The volitions of the Almighty One were known to man only through the miracle of revelation. Predestination and free- will were harmonized, and "the ways of God to man" were justified by "the Mediatorial scheme of Jesus Christ." By strict adherence to a belief in the freedom of specula- tion as to all things human and divine, Shaftesbury was led counter to all this. His unorthodoxy, however, was directed against the machinery of religion, rather than against religion itself. He tells us that he was "fully assured of his own orthodoxy, resignation, and entire submission to the truly Christian and Catholic doctrine of the Holy Church, as by Law established."'8 The Fourth Earl speaks of his father as ''very constant in his attendance at church and in receiving Communion when his asthma would permit."'9 That he was 17 Inquiry concerning Virtue, Pt. III, section 2. 18 Cited by Fowler, p. 60. 19 Rand, Life, Letters, and Philosophical Regimen, London, 1900, p. xxvii.</page><page sequence="7">SHAFTESBURY IN ENGLISH SPECULATION 181 religious in nature, if not orthodox according to any creed, is apparent in a letter to his brother Maurice,20 wherein he rejoices in the fact that reason and education had placed them "in a religion and church where in respect to the moderate party and far greater part the principle of charity was really more extensive than in any Christian or Protestant Church besides in the world." He hated "impure and horrid superstitions," "monstrous enthusiasms," and "wild fanati- cisms;" and believed in "prayer and devotion not rage and fits of loose extravagance," "religious discourses not cant and unintelligible nonsense." Warton quotes Bishop Butler as having said that "if Shaftesbury had lived to see the candor and moderation of the present times in discussing religious subjects, he would have been a good Christian."'2' He might have added that the sight of the increased sanity and rationalism that had come into religion would have given him great personal satisfaction because of the part that he had most certainly played in bringing about "candor and moderation." Naturally Shaftesbury's religious nature could not exten- uate his sceptical utterances. The acrimony of Berkeley, Warburton, and Leland was directed against him, and Christian apologists everywhere charged him openly with atheism, and allied him, rightly, among the Deists as an enemy of revealed religion.22 By giving special stress to the adequacy of natural religion and the consequent futility of revelation, to man's natural goodness, to his possession of a "moral sense," to the fitness of all things in the universe, and to Benevolence as the acme of virtue, Shaftesbury gave vogue and authority to ideas that were to be far reaching in their effect on the intellectual 20 Rand, Ibid., p. xxvii. 21Warton Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope, London, 1806, II, 97. 22 See Skelton, Deism Revealed, I, 34-35, for a succinct statement of the Deistical Creed.

ALDERMAN temper and social constitution of the decades immediately to follow. Despite the grimaces of such men as Addison, Swift, Steele, Defoe, Fielding, Johnson, Burke, and a host of other litterateurs, at the scepticism of the age, Shaftesbury gradually battered his way into narrow orthodoxy, and, by his open-mindedness and fairness, caused its expansion. The churchmen, while looking askance at his abolition of supernaturalism and future rewards, were inevitably drawn to the chaste and exalted picture of virtue which he presented. Although they were invariably convinced that many of his teachings were too flimsy and inadequate to effect the re- generation of corrupt mankind, the strongest of them were too sensible to be other than rationalists. It would be far from the truth to maintain that Shaftesbury was the sole force operative in the rationalization of an antiquated theology. The leaven was already at work before he began his publications, and continued, independent of as well as because of his influence, long after his death. What can be said with all candor and fairness, however, is that he gave special poignancy and thrust to many an idea already strug- gling for an adequate enunciator, and that in the decades following his death his name became synonymous, in the public and philosophical mind, with certain doctrines variously regarded as God-born or pernicious. In some matters he may be safely credited with standing wholly apart from all of his immediate predecessors. To him is generally awarded the first use of the term "moral sense," which so frequently finds place in the aesthetic theories of his disciple Hutcheson. Shaftesbury's name has become the shibboleth for the Benevolent Theory of Morals. His God lost all of the vengeance of the Hebrew Deity, and became a Benevolent Ruler; and the outstanding character- istic of his virtuous man became his Benevolence. To him more than to any other English writer was due the nadir of Hobbes's egoistic theories, and the elevation of man's natural goodness. The optimistic theory that regarded the world as an harmonious whole, and taught, in the words of Pope, that</page><page sequence="9">SHAFTESBURY IN ENGLISH SPECULATION 183 "Whatever is, is right," was planted ineradicably through- out the pages of his works, and therein effectively sheltered from the attacking rays of an adverse philosophy. The times themselves concurred to the advantage of Shaftesbury. It is likely that philosophical speculation pre- ceded the outward show of change, but the new doctrines were well timed. The religious restraint of the preceding decades, the formalism in art and literature, the drama of the Restoration so uncomplimentary to human nature, the egoism of Hobbes, and the humiliating acrimony of Mande- ville, all helped to discount and render repulsive a certain body of intellectual rationale. The old orthodoxy found in the egoism of Hobbes one of its most hated enemies, but the new rationalism could not but realize the justice in Shaftesbury's characterization of the time-honored doctrines of rewards and punishments as the "rod and sweetmeat" method. The age itself was coming to have a hearty distrust for scholastic traditions, and the Deists, the Com- bridge Platonists, the rational theologians, and Locke23 were but co6rdinate parts of the same movement. All of them were rationalists, but their insistence upon reason did not lead them to the same conclusions. In certain of their principles the Latitudinarians and the Deists were as diver- gent from Locke on the one hand as they were from Hobbes on the other. This dissimilitude amidst similitude suggests a further comparison which, strangely enough, seems not to have been made with any definitiveness. Shaftesbury's first venture into print-as has often been casually noted-was his Preface to a volume of sermons by Benjamin Whichcote which he edited and had published in 1698.24 Perhaps the scarcity of the Preface and the still greater scarcity of the Sermons has led to their neglect. Wishart, reprinting the Sermons in 1742, re- marks: "There never was before but one Impression of them 2B See Hefelbower, op. cit., pp. 172-184, for a fuller discussion of this point. 54Select Sermons of Dr. Whichcot, in two parts, London, 1698.</page><page sequence="10">184 WILLIAM E. ALDERMAN that I know of; which is now exceedingly scarce."25 "The first Publication of this book we owe to a late Noble Author [Shaftesbury] pretty well known for his own Performances; who having very providentially met with the Manuscript, was so much taken with it, that he revis'd it, put it to the Press, and wrote the following Preface to it."26 Then follows27 Shaftesbury's Preface which had not been reprinted up to that time and which has appeared but once since.28 Benjamin Whichcote (1609-1683), "being disgusted with the dry systematical ways of those times,"29 made so sub- stantial a contribution to the rationalization of thought that "the Testimony which the late Arch-bishop Tillotson has given of him, tho' it be in a Funeral Sermon, is known to be in nothing superior to his Desert.""0 Wishart character- ized his sermons as "a Mine, out of which you may dig," "a Model, by which you may improve," "a Piece of Rich Ore."'" Whichcote was preeminently rationalistic. To him the way of reason was "the way most accomodate to Humane Nature."82 "To act contrary to the Reason of one's own Mind, is to do a thing most unnatural and cruel: it is to offer Violence to a Man's self."33 "Men are wanting to them- selves, if they do not see with their own Eyes; if they do not search and use a Judgment of discerning."34 Indeed "the Perfection and Happiness of Humane Nature consists in the right Use of our Rational Faculties, and in the Vigor and Intense Exercise of them, about their proper and proportion- able Object.""5 God, the most proportionable of all objects, 26 Wishart's Preface to the Select Sermons of Dr. Whichcot, Edinburgh, 1742, p. iii. 26 Select Sermons, 1742, p. xviii. 27 Ibid., xxi-xxxv. 28 This Preface was reprinted in Letters of the Earl of Skaftesbury, 1758. 29 Bumet, History of his Own Times, London, 1850, p. 127.

The doctrine of the former was alluded to above. To the latter "the Will and Law of God," if it is arbitrary and variable, is without reason. To those who "think that God uses Arbitrary Power; and that they might escape Punishment, if he would; and that there is nothing but his Will and Pleasure"40 his answer is that "the Reasons of things are Eternal: they are not subject to any power,'"4' and that God, neither "by Power and Priviledge" cannot do that which is not just.42 "Neither the Evil of Sin, nor the Evil of Punishment can be attributed to God;" rather they are "Consequential, Necessary, Fatal."43 Such a God is to be loved not for "what he is to us," but for "what he is in himself;" not "because he may be good to us," but "because he is the most lovely Object in himself, the first and chiefest Goodness;" not because "he is necessary to our Happiness," but "because of his own Loveliness, Excellency, and Beauty."44 With Hobbes he is equally at variance. Although he does not mention his name, the allusion is unquestionable when he says, "Wherefore we may detest and reject that Doctrine which saith, that God made Man in a State of War."45 36 Select Sermons, p. 106. 37 Ibid., p. 112. 38 Ibid., p. 152. 39Ibid., p. 109.

ALDERMAN edit and to have published the sermons of Whichcote is the strongest evidence possible of a close bond of intellectual kinship between them. Shaftesbury's Preface attests this relationship. With Whichcote he is at odds with Hobbes, whom he accuses of having done "but very ill Service to the Moral World" and of having spread the poison of immoral and atheistical principles. His special quarrel with him was that he in "reckoning up the Passions or Affections, by which Men are held together in Society, live in Peace, or have any Correspondence one with another, forgot to mention Kind- ness, Friendship, Sociableness, Love of Company and Converse, Natural Affection, or anything of this kind. ... So much less Good-nature has he left with Mankind, than he allows to the worst of beasts." Having referred to Which- cote's counter doctrine, he continues, in real affection, "Thus speaks our excellent Divine, and truly Christian Philoso- pher; whom, for his appearing thus in Defense of Natural Goodness, we may call the Preacher of Good-nature. This is what he insists on every-where; and, to make this evident, is, in a Manner, the Scope of all his Discourses." Inasmuch as the Characteristics of Shaftesbury have been so frequently published as to be readily accessible, further resemblances need not be pointed out here. Suffice it to say that a critical comparison of the ideas of Shaftesbury's complete works with those of Whichcote's sermons will fail to reveal in the former few of importance that are not more than implied in the latter. A beneficent God, an harmonious uni- verse, optimism, natural religion, man's natural goodness, moral sense, benevolence, the inevitable reward of virtue,- these and other characteristic subjects with Shaftesbury are definitely foreshadowed or openly supported by Whichcote. A meticulous comparison will reveal, also, striking similari- ties of manner, phrase, and figure. One is not to conclude from this that Shaftesbury is indebted to Whichcote alone; quite the contrary. What is clear, however, is that at least by, and in all probability before 1698 (the year in which the Sermons were actually</page><page sequence="15">SHAFTESBURY IN ENGLISH SPECULATION 189 published) Shaftesbury's thoughts were flowing in congenial and well defined channels. As time went on, the course deepened, the waters broadened, and the contributory streams doubtless multiplied, but the system remained essentially the same. This, obviously, is to be taken into serious account when Spinoza and Leibnitz are urged as the direct intellectual parents of Shaftesbury.65 It is only fair to Shaftesbury, however, to insist that he, and not Whichcote, was responsible for the spread of certain sentimental and deistic doctrines that fastened themselves upon the thought of his century. Whereas the sermons of Whichcote appeared in print only twice, prefaces, separate essays, letters, and the collected works of Shaftesbury were printed and reprinted twenty-five times in English between 1698 and 1790. One edition of the Characteristics followed another, and each had a ready sale.66 Attacks and counter attacks sprang up, and defenses were not wanting. The con- troversial furor which his works provoked marks one of the battles royal of the century. He was more than an imitator; he was a sincere and vigorous propagandist, whose writings, by reason of their manner and matter, became immediately popular and affected deeply the speculations of the time. The discipleship of a noble company of English thinkers is both immediate and unmistakable. That Pope, Thomson, Brooke, Cooper, Akenside, and their literary successors bear a close consanguinity to Shaftesbury has been shown else- where.67 By the middle of the century his doctrines were indigenous to the English soil. f It is quite probable that he did not become acquaited with the writings of Spinoza until 1698. Leibnitz's Theodicte was not published until 1710. 6 The dates of the English editions are: 1711, 1714, 1723, 1727, 1732, 1733, 1737, 1744, 1749, 1773, 1790. Editions also appeared in France and Germany. 67 See The Influence of the Writings of the Third Earl of Shaftesbury on the Literature of the Eighteenth Century, by the present writer, in MS. in the library of the University of Wisconsin; The Style of Shaftesbury, also by the present writer, Modern Language Notes, Vol. XXXVIII; Shaftesbury and the Ethical Poets by C.

Its brilliancy and its intensity were irrestible, and English morality and literature, without doubt, felt its pulse strongly. But it found the ground already fertilized for and much of it already sown with seeds like unto its own. How large the sentimental harvest would have been, or how delayed it would have been, had not the impetus been given by Rous- seau, is problematical; but certain it is that there would have been a harvest, and no meager one at that. By way of approach to this problem, one can only state here, without tracing them, the conclusions and practices to which the sentimental tenets of Shaftesbury led."8 The acceptance of the theory of an intuitive sense of right and wrong, and a belief in the essential goodness of human nature, despite the struggles of the orthodox and the heroic efforts of certain moralists, did, without the least shadow of doubt, tend to lessen the austerity with which morality had been regarded. If man's instincts were to be trusted, the need for internal warfare and eternal resistance was greatly lessened, and action according to inclination became legalized. This enfranchisement of the feelings was further accentu- ated by an insistence upon the exercise of the benevolent affections. While ameliorating the distress of others, the sentimentalist became conscious of the deliciousness of the feeling of compassion on the one hand, and of self-approba- tion on the other. Thus a flabby emotionalism came into being which considered the thrill to be the end rather than the accompaniment of virtuous action. The volume of tears shed and the robustness of the heart throb became the stand- ards of happiness. In the next place this namby-pamby drift was augmented by a similar tendency in connection with the enjoyment of nature. While many continued their contemplation of her for purely moral ends, others sought her 68 For a study of the spread and development of Shaftesbury's ideas, see the studies by Moore and by the present writer referred to in the note immediately preceding.</page><page sequence="17">SHAFTESBURY IN ENGLISH SPECULATION 191 because of the flaccid sensuousness which her mysteries, her prospects, and her beauty excited. The return to nature was also based on a postulated age in the dim past when man's life was ideal. The political effects of such hazardous doctrines were not long in coming to the surface. The exaltation of the swain and the savage above their educated leaders led to class hatreds and a desire for equality. The belief in a Golden Age in the past naturally aroused a desire for the recurrence of such an age in the unsatisfactory present. The political discontent that imperiled the government is an historical fact that needs only to be mentioned to be remembered. When, in 1770, Burke thundered out against present dis- contents, he was actually decrying a radicalism that had been born of sentimental idealism. With these facts in mind, the reader can readily compre- hend the statement that the Englishman of 1760-1770 was already familiar with "beautiful souls," a truce from moral struggle, a "return to nature," a primitive Golden Age, a hearty discontent with the present, man's natural goodness, the infallibility of the feelings, and all their kin, when the French example and influence came to encourage and to cheer. The seeds of radicalism were already sown braodcast in minds that had been under cultivation since the early part of the century; the ferment of discontent had already worked to a point where the mother was easily discernible. The foreign brew, therefore, came to supplement and to hasten rather than to create. In some cases, the new seeds, because of their virulence, took root and grew where formerly similar life had been choked out by the more vigorous plants of rationalism; in other cases, the French influence was simply the sunshine and the showers which hastened the maturity and fruition of a tropical growth of emotionalism, individualism, and radicalism. It is to be understood that no attempt is being made to disparage the emphasis that has been placed upon the po- tency of Jacobinism. The debt which William Godwin, Mary</page><page sequence="18">192 WILLIAM E. ALDERMAN Wollstonecraft, Thomas Paine, Richard Price, and a score of others owe to the French Revolution is clearly in mind. What is being insisted upon, however, is that the citadel of English conservatism was not taken by storm or by surprise; its keepers had long since been reduced in number, and many of those who remained were far less vigilant than were their predecessors. A specious incrustation had covered its walls, while within disintegrating processes had been silently at work. Defoe, Swift, Butler, Fielding, Burke, and Dr. Johnson were sufficient to scotch but not to kill the serpents of sentimentalism and scepticism, sprung respec- tively from Shaftesbury and his opponent Mandeville. When viewed with these facts in mind, sentimental educa- tion as advocated first by Brooke in The Fool of Quality, William Blake's desire for the marriage of Heaven and Hell, the "return to Nature" movement, typified by Burns and Cowper, the calculated overflow of powerful emotions that appears not always to have been absent from the mind of Wordsworth when he wrote the Lyrical Ballads, the revolu- tionary tendencies in Shelley, the pantisocratic scheme of Coleridge and Southey, and the sentimentality which culminated in Byron, are all seen to be the possible offspring of English progenitors. Certainly Collins's world of Pity, Mercy, and Liberty is peopled with sentimental ideals. If Phelps is right in making a fondness for "ivy-mantled towers and moonlit water" and "a passion for the unnatural and the horrible" spring from the same state of mind,69 and if Neilson is correct in making sentimentalism and sensa- tionalism in art "parallel tendencies,"70 what is to be said of the Gothic novels characterized by ghosts, enchanted swords, dark passages, secret apartments, uninhabited galleries, haunting spirits, howling winds, and similar phenomena equally emotional? Beers makes the senti- mentalism of Mrs. Radcliffe akin to that of Richardson, Rousseau, Sterne, and Mackenzie, and remarks, among other 69 English Romantic Movement, pp. 4-5. 70 Essentials of Poetry, p. 240.</page><page sequence="19">SHAFTESBURY IN ENGLISH SPECULATION 193 things, that "Emily, in the "Mysteries of Udolpho" cannot see the moon or hear a guitar or an organ or the murmur of the pines, without weeping. Every page is bedewed with the tear of sensibility. . . Mrs. Radcliffe's characters are all descendants of Pamela and Clarissa Harlowe, but under more romantic circumstances.""7 Walpole made the union of the chivalric and the Richardsonian romance the purpose of his Castle of Otranto,72 and certainly the trials of his characters and the characters themselves are eminently sentimental. Again, it would be interesting to speculate with regard to the color which Wesley and his followers may have reflected from the emotionalism of the time. Wesley was more like Shaftesbury than like Law in his ideas of benevolence and reform. When he grants that the "traditional evidence of Christianity might be destroyed without injurying the faith," that "the ultimate and incontrovertible evidence is the evidence of the believer's heart," and that Christianity is not founded upon argument, but upon sentiment inter- preted as God's voice speaking to the soul,73 he sounds dangerously like that which it would have pained him to have consciously imitated. Much that appears in the nineteenth century might, similarly, be traced with reasonable certainty to Shaftesbury. Robertson remarks that "it may well have been by lineal literary descent from him that Browning drew his creed; for we find it accepted, apparently from the Characteristics, by Priestley, who passed it on to the Unitarian Cogan and to W. J. Fox, from whose preaching in South Palace Chapel Browning would seem to have partly derived it."74 A n A History of English Romanticism in the Eighteenth Century, p. 252. 72Preface to Second Edition. 73Quoted from Stephen's summary in English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, II, 415. 74 Characteristics, p. xxxvi, where he cites Essay on the First Principles of Government, 2nd ed. 1771, pp. 257-261 and Dr. Conway's Centenary of the South Place Society, 1894, pp. 80, 89 as sources of information.</page><page sequence="20">194 WILLIAM E. ALDERMAN similar patrimony may have come to Tennyson through Frederick Denison Maurice and his precursors.76 Two other subjects in which Shaftesbury influenced the speculation and literature of the time deserve a much more extended consideration than can be given to them in this study. Leslie Stephen remarks that "a hatred for enthusi- asm was as strongly impressed upon the whole character of contemporary thought as a hatred for scepticism."76 The connection of Shaftesbury with this subject will be made clear by a review of the titles of his earlier treatises and of those written in defense of and in opposition to him.77 A related controversy was that which sprang from Shaftes- bury's proposed panacea of ridicule and good humor, raillery and wit. In this much ink was spilled. Warburton, naturally, objected to it, if for no other reason than that is was fostered by the Third Earl,78 and Fielding gave it extended notice in his preface to Joseph Andrews, where, in discussing burlesque, the Ridiculuous, Caricatura, and the like, he says: "And I apprehend my Lord Shaftesbury's opinion of mere burlesque agrees with mine when he asserts, There is no such thing to be found in the writings of the ancients. " So much has been said of the deleterious effects of Shaftes- bury's writings that their uplifting tendency is likely to be forgotten. Smollett attributed the downfall of Miss Wil- liams largely to the ways of free-thinking that had been engendered in her by the reading of three authors,-and one of these was Shaftesbury.79 This was by no means an un- usual charge; but whatever may have been the noxious re- sults of his doctrines, certainly his intentions were venial and many of his effects have been salutary.

We must judge the sheer force of any man not more by the direction from which he has brought us or by the place to which he has brought us, than by the distance which he has brought us and by the number of ambushes that he has encountered along the way. Whether Shaftesbury led us from light to darkness or from darkness to light-and he did both-may, in connection with certain specific points, be a matter of opinion; but that he was a bold originator and an intrepid leader who stamped his ideas upon the thought and literature of his century can never be gainsaid.
