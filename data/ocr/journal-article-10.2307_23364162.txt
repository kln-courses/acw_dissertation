Social presence is a social factor, specifically addressing the feeling of being present with another person in a virtual environment. This article describes possibilities to influence the feeling of social presence in synchronous learning scenarios using desktop collaborative virtual environ ments (CVEs). Desktop CVEs are technically simple compared with immersive CVEs and can be adapted according to the needs of the users. In this article, possible adaptations are described using the example of the desktop CVE virtual team room. In CVEs, users are represented as avatars. Avatars may or may not convey nonverbal signals. The focus of the article is on whether the actual use of nonverbal signals can affect the sense of social presence and thus help to establish and maintain the learner's motivation and provide support for structuring social interaction in learning situations. The paper provides a review of exploratory studies and experiments as well as a report on the author's own studies. Future research questions concerning learning in CVEs are discussed. Keywords Nonverbal signal • Avatar ■ Social presence • Collaborative virtual environments • Synchronous online learning Over the last decade, the concept of learning as an interactive and collaborative process has gained attention (Gulz and Haake, 2006). The perspective that learning is a fundamentally social phenomenon is reflected in the steadily growing research area of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL; Stahl, 2006). This article focuses on synchronous CSCL scenarios, also known as real-time or online learning scenarios. CSCL scenarios give rise to new challenges in terms of mutually constructing "meaning", establishing and maintaining the user's motivation, as well as structuring social interaction in learning situations K. Allmendinger (El) Acontrain, Koberleweg 8, 78464 Konstanz, Germany e-mail: katrin.allmendinger@acontrain.de &lt;£j Springer</page><page sequence="2">42 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 according to the principle of "who does when what?" (Bromme et al. 2005, p. 4). Social contextual facilitators relevant for social interaction are also called "social affordances" (Kirschner and Kreijns, 2005). These facilitators aim at structuring interaction and supporting motivation by providing a set of communication media accompanied by awareness information that help users to feel present in a virtual environment with other users. For synchronous learning scenarios in companies and organizations, desktop collabo rative virtual environments (CVEs) are often used (Allmendinger et al. 2009). In CVEs, users are represented as avatars. In particular, the possibility to convey nonverbal information via avatars is reviewed in this article as it is often reported as being strongly connected to the feeling of social presence (e.g., Becker and Mark, 2002; Hesse et al. 1995; Schweizer et al. 2000). It can be assumed that computer-mediated nonverbal signals not only lead to a higher sense of social presence, but also support turn-taking management as well as feedback processes in instructional situations. In the first two sections of the article, the properties of CVEs and core issues of communication in collaborative contexts are addressed. The article then focuses on how tutors or teachers, and to some extent also learners, can adapt desktop CVEs to the needs of a given learning scenario. Different forms of representing users and their communicative behavior in CVEs, and the influence of these two aspects on social presence are described. The empirical review section comprises a review of exploratory and experimental studies as well as a report on the author's own studies. Desktop Collaborative Virtual Environments CVEs can be defined as computer-based worlds that can enhance and expand our ability to communicate and collaborate synchronously in a computer-mediated context with other users (Broil et al. 2002). CVEs can include multiple communication channels, for instance text, audio, and visual signals displaying nonverbal information, as well as external representations such as shared software applications. This article will deal exclusively with technically simple CVEs, also called desktop CVEs, which can be used via the monitor of a personal computer (e.g., Second Life, Yee and Bailenson, 2008; Active Worlds, Peterson, 2006). Immersive CVEs are technically more complex. They perceptually surround the user, for instance, by wearing a head-mounted display that projects the virtual environment on digital displays, and increase his or her sense of actually being in the environment (for a review concerning learning in immersive CVEs, cf. Bailenson et al. 2008; Blascovich and Beall, 2010). Interactants are displayed in CVEs as avatars, which can be defined as "digital representations of one another" (Bailenson et al. 2008, p. 104). People can select and customize avatars for a variety of online interactions, including working, relationship building, gaming, and learning. The images representing people during online interactions have been called "buddy icons", virtual images, or avatars, and are quite diverse. Avatars may resemble humans, animals, fantasy creatures, or objects. The use of avatars influences people's involvement in interactions as well as their perceptions of others they encounter (Bailenson et al. 2002; Bailenson et al. 2008; Nowak and Rauh, 2007). In learning situations, humanoid avatars are often used (Allmendinger, 2005; Bailenson et al. 2008; Peterson, 2006; Prasolova-F0rland, 2004). In the following section, the role of nonverbal signals in computer-mediated learning scenarios is compared with face-to-face scenarios. Main theories and concrete verbal and nonverbal channels of CVEs are mentioned. Springer</page><page sequence="3">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 43 Verbal and Nonverbal Signals in Collaborative Computer-Mediated Contexts In face-to-face learning situations, nonverbal communication has been shown to have important effects (Merola and Poggi, 2003; Roth, 2001): (a) Nonverbal signals can support the conversational flow by fostering smooth turn-taking management and providing feedback to learners, (b) gestures in particular can provide "cognitive support" aimed at conveying information that is helpful for understanding the tutor's or learner's information presentation and discourse, and (c) nonverbal communication can express emotions and attitudes. Although computer-mediated communication as compared with face-to-face communi cation differs in terms of conveyable information (Baltes et al. 2002; Walther and Burgoon, 1992), it can be assumed that computer-mediated nonverbal signals in instructional situations can also affect turn-taking management, feedback, cognitive support, and the communication of emotions. There are a number of theoretical approaches comparing face to-face communication and different forms of computer-mediated communication, which serve as a background for current empirical studies in the area of CVEs. The Social Presence Theory (Short et al. 1976) predicts that a communication medium can lead to a certain degree of experience of social presence, depending on the capacity of the medium to transmit information (measured on a series of bipolar scales such as impersonal-personal). Short et al. (1976, p. 65) connect the construct of social presence to the "degree of the salience of the other person in the interaction". In addition to verbal information, they also refer to nonverbal information and explicitly differentiate the following aspects (see Fig. 1): nonvocal, nonverbal information (e.g., gestures), vocal, nonverbal communication (e.g., volume), and nonverbal information in a broader sense (e.g., clothing). The notion that the information richness of a medium influences social presence is also assumed by other theories such as the Media Equation Theory (Reeves and Nass, 1996). The Media Richness Theory (Daft and Lengel, 1986) and the Task Media Fit Approach (McGrath and Hollingshead, 1993) emphasize the match between the demands of certain types of tasks and the face-to-face or computer-mediated communication situation. Media high in information richness are predicted to be more suitable for complex tasks because they provide a broad range of communication possibilities that support the completion of such tasks. Fig. 1 Areas of nonverbal communication (according to Short et al. 1976) &lt;2J Springer</page><page sequence="4">44 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 In synchronous collaborative computer-mediated contexts, the following communication channels play a role: Verbal signals can be sent via text chat and audio channel. Using keyboard symbols to display facial expressions or emotional states ("emoticons") and using text, for instance bold letters or exclamation marks to display the effects of intonation, make it possible to give additional nonverbal background information to text chat contributions (Peterson, 2006; Walther and Tidwell, 1995). Depending on the underlying technology, nonvocal nonverbal signals can be tracked (e.g., hand gestures using cybergloves) and rendered according to real-life movements (e.g., Bailenson et al. 2008; Benford et al. 1995) or a predefined repertoire of nonverbal signals can be activated, for example by mouse click on specific buttons in the control bar or by keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Guye-Vuilleme et al. 1999; Taylor, 2002, Peterson, 2006). Position, orientation, and focus of attention in CVEs can be manipulated by moving and placing the avatar for example, by use of keyboard arrows, the mouse, navigation buttons on the monitor, or "hot spots" displayed for teleportation in the virtual environment (Anderson et al. 2001; Bowers et al. 1996; Hindmarsh et al. 2001, Peterson, 2006). Nonverbal signals in predefined repertoires have in common that they have to be consciously activated by the user. Nevertheless, in some CVEs, there are nonverbal signals, also called "liveliness signals", for instance blinking of the eyes or breathing, which are automatically generated by the system (Anderson et al. 2001; Guye-Vuilleme et al. 1999). Some CVEs also include signals that are activated by certain activities in the virtual environment, for instance a whisper gesture, if one user addresses another in a private chat channel (Allmendinger, 2005). In general, the interfaces of CVEs offer the possibility to adapt the system according to the specific needs, for instance concerning collaborative methods, imposed by a learning situation. How Desktop CVEs Can be Adapted to the Demands of Specific Learning Situations As mentioned above, social interaction in CSCL situations requires structure. Such structure can be provided, for example, by adapting the technology used according to the needs of the learning situation. The following section will provide an overview of aspects that can be adapted prior to or, circumstances permitting, during a synchronous learning session. For this purpose, I will focus on a particular desktop CVE, the virtual team room (vitero) system, used for learning and collaboration at universities, public organizations, and companies in Europe (wwvv.vitero.de). Preliminary versions of the vitero system also formed the basis of the line of research that will be presented in the empirical review section of this article. The vitero system includes a slide projector for rendering and controlling presentations, application sharing, joint browsing and creativity techniques (e.g., brainstorming), the possibility of splitting the group up into subgroups, and a language laboratory. The users are represented by avatars with name tags placed around a virtual table (see Fig. 2). After entering the virtual room, the tutor adapts the system to various aspects of the learning situation (see Fig. 3). Concerning the structure of the virtual room, the tutor decides on the layout of the room (color etc.), how many seats are placed around the virtual table, how the name tag is composed (first/last name), and whether a co-tutor's chair is required. Moreover, depending on the necessity of splitting the learning group up into subgroups, the tutor prepares additional virtual rooms. Besides audio communication (voice over internet protocol or telephone conference), a text channel, represented as a word balloon by the avatar, as well Springer</page><page sequence="5">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 45 Is= -xl _ &lt; *csr topiuU 0««tuHdt M 4 07/ti ► M j. 9 X vitero as interface individual (staff) organisation environment (customer) ® "%&gt; Qt B b &amp; 6 &lt;? 5 V V &lt;%! not $ Fig. 2 Virtual team room (vitero) as a set of gestures is provided. A virtual microphone is available to moderate the communication process and to open the audio channel of users signaling a desire to contribute something. The virtual microphone is an example of how thoroughly learning sessions can be preconfigured and changed within a learning session. It is possible to allow the tutor alone to place the microphone in a teacher-oriented learning setting, to allow the participants to place the microphone by themselves for "round table" learning settings or to open the audio channels of all participants at once, for instance while brainstorming. In general, the users are represented by avatars based on uploaded digital photos, but the tutor can also permit a video representation of the user in vitero. In this case, the tutor and learners sit in front of their respective webcam and their video image is displayed at their virtual chair. The video representation is a good example of both tutor and learner adapting the system according to their needs. Although the tutor decides on the basic conditions, the learner can decide whether or not to actually use the given resources. One factor influencing the tutor's and learner's decision regarding the use of video representations is the perceived requirement of obtaining a certain level of social presence within the learning setting. Social Presence in CVEs Social presence was originally investigated as an issue in the area of telecommunications. In the aforementioned Social Presence Theory, Short et al. (1976) regard social presence as a single dimension representing a cognitive synthesis of several factors that occur naturally in face-to-face communication, for instance tone of voice and gestures. This original concept of social presence has been adapted in various ways with regard to collaborative Springer</page><page sequence="6">46 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 ..PPfo"5 ..Bwpggagnasm Settings wl be effective tiring the ongoing session only, vftero room My PC Favories Number of chairs |12 gj + mediators chair Name tag ] First name and Name T~j V" co-moderators chair / adjormg rooms Number of adjoining rooms |l ^ Names of edjoinrig rooms [A, B, C,... y| Depiay presentation automatical | None y- Alow webcam Telephone conference layout I Btue layout OK | Cancel Fig. 3 Options window to adapt vitero to the needs of the learning situation virtual environments (e.g., Bente et al. 2008). Heeter (1992) defines social presence as the extent to which other beings, both living and synthetic, exist in the virtual environment and appear to react to the user. She stresses that the interaction plays a major role regarding the feeling of social presence: "Someone or something else that seems to believe that you are there may help convince you that you are there" (p. 262). Other scholars also define social presence exclusively with regard to computer-mediated settings, but focus on human-to-human interaction rather than on synthetic beings as interaction partners, for instance computer-controlled agents in a learning setting. Salinas (2005) refers to social presence as the feeling of being present with another person at a remote location. In a similar way, Blascovich (2002) states that social presence is connected to the perception of existing within an interpersonal environment. This definition will be used within the current paper. The representation of users plays an important role in achieving a feeling of social presence: "At a very basic level, bodies root us and make us present, to ourselves and to others" (Taylor, 2002, p. 41). In general, the main functions of avatars in virtual environments are identification (e.g., who is tutor, who is learner) and interaction support (see Fig. 4, Allmendinger, 2005; Garau, 2006). To ensure easy identification in working and learning contexts, avatars resembling the user, and name tags displayed near the avatars, are often used (e.g., Allmendinger, 2005; Peterson, 2006). Concerning the second main function of avatars, namely interaction support, two components can be distinguished: avatars give us group awareness information, for instance about the learner's focus of attention, and they can display communication cues. Regarding the first component, group awareness information can be described as social affordance devices that graphically display a set of group awareness data (Kirschner and Kreijns, 2005). Such data represent the activities in which group members are engaged (see Gutwin et al. 1996, for more details). The second form of interaction support, communication cues, can be implemented in various ways in CVEs. For instance, speech bubbles containing text •£) Springer</page><page sequence="7">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 47 Reasons for the presence of avatars in CVEs X 2.

Identification •user •role • status • group membership Fig. 4 Reasons for representing users as avatars (according to Allmendinger, 2005) chat messages can be provided or signals that help to identify who is talking in the audio channel, such as mouth movements or sound waves at the avatar's loudspeaker (Anderson et al. 2001; Scheck et al. 2008). Moreover, positive involvement of learners can be achieved, for example by providing feedback and cues for the nonverbal expression of emotions. It can be assumed that computer-mediated nonverbal signals in instructional situations lead to a higher perception of social presence and thus help to structure learning settings, for instance by facilitating turn-taking management. In the following section, the possibility to convey nonverbal information in particular is reviewed, as it is often reported to positively affect social presence as well as the regulation of the interaction within a group (e.g., Becker and Mark, 2002; Hesse et al. 1995; Reeves and Nass, 1996; Schweizer et al. 2000; Short et al. 1976). In so doing, possibilities of establishing and maintaining the user's motivation as well as structuring social interaction in learning situations are addressed (Bromme et al. 2005). Empirical Findings Concerning Nonverbal Signals in Desktop Collaborative Virtual Environments Empirical research on collaboration in the field of desktop CVEs is still sparse (Clayes and Anderson, 2007, Hindmarsh et al. 2001), and most of the studies refer to collaboration in general and not specifically collaborative learning. In this section, the existing body of research will be reviewed, including the author's own studies concerning verbal and nonverbal behavior in desktop CVEs. Exploratory studies will be discussed first, followed by experimental studies. The selected studies have in common that the collaborative situation took place in a desktop CVE and that in at least one condition, avatars displaying nonverbal signals were available. Exploratory studies There are a number of studies that describe the use of nonverbal signals in CVEs without quantifying the results. After having observed 20 h of interaction in the CVEs Active Worlds (with text chat) and Online Traveler (with audio channel and text chat), Becker and Mark (2002) report, for example, that the use of the nonverbal signals for "wave hello", &lt;3 Springer</page><page sequence="8">48 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 "jump", "dance" as well as four facial expressions was rather rare. Nonverbal signals were expressed more often via text chat ("emoticons"), audio channel (e.g., laughing vocally in Online Traveler), or navigation (or proxemics, respectively, e.g., moving avatar if situation becomes uninteresting). Nilsson et al. (2002) also used Active Worlds for their study of ten observed sessions and state that the nonverbal signals were initially used for familiarization purposes, but their use disappeared over the course of the sessions. The regulation of turn taking was perceived as problematic (also cf. Bowers et al. 1996; Lantz, 2001). Other qualitative studies regarding CVEs show that in particular, the ability to raise the avatar's hand was used more often than other gestures and was perceived as an important and helpful nonverbal signal for managing turn-taking (Anderson et al. 2001; Guye-Vuilleme et al. 1999). These results reveal that nonverbal signals for turn-taking in synchronous online scenarios are a useful means of regulating interaction within a group and help to structure social interaction in learning situations. In comparison to the exploratory studies reported above, our own exploratory studies have focused on learning in desktop CVEs, and we have collected quantitative measures. The studies were conducted in preliminary versions of the aforementioned vitero system. The following communication modes were available: audio channel, text chat, and nonverbal signs for "thumb up", "thumb down", "hand raising", "applause", "question mark", "wave hello", as well as a virtual microphone and arrows to refer, for instance, to information on the slides. All of the nonverbal signals required conscious use; none of them were activated automatically. The users were represented by avatars based on digital photos of themselves. Our first study is based on the communication data of five groups with two to five employees each (Miiller et al. 2002). Altogether, 19 people participated and filled out a questionnaire following their learning sessions. Since the results are similar to the results of the second exploratory study, they will be reported only briefly. On average, 0.32 nonverbal signals per minute were displayed by the user's avatar. The "thumb up" signal and the arrows were used most often. Expressing approval and highlighting information on the slides in order to structure the conversation were the most relevant reasons for using the nonverbal signals. The questionnaire data show that the participants liked the sessions and felt that they were able to communicate successfully in the CVE. The results reveal that the virtual environment has the potential to support the conversational flow in instructional communication scenarios. In particular, smooth feedback mechanisms and cognitive support by highlighting information were the reasons the learners gave for using the nonverbal signals. Our second exploratory study was conducted during a seminar, with 21 university students (16 male, five female) participating in at least four of 6 vitero sessions (Allmendinger et al. 2007). In a randomly chosen session, objective communication data were observed on the basis of logfiles: 1.28 text chat contributions were made by the group per minute and 5.96 nonverbal signals per minute were displayed by the group within the course of the session. In particular, the signals "thumb up" (2.63 signals per minute), "applause" (2.50 signals per minute), and "thumb down" (0.60 signals per minute) were used often by the group. The questionnaire data show that the students liked the sessions in general (M=6.1, SD=0.8, scale from 1 "absolutely not" to 7 "very good"). They said that the text chat (M=6.1, SD=1.0, scale from 1 "absolutely not" to 7 "very much") as well as the nonverbal signals (M= 6.1, SD=1.0, same scale) contributed to convenient communi cation. The signals for "thumb up" (M= 6.8, SD=0.7), "thumb down" (M=6.7, SD=0.8), and "hand raising" (M=6.0, SD=1.2, scale from 1 "very unimportant" to 7 "very important") were rated as especially important (compared with M= 4.7, SD=1.2 for the © Springer</page><page sequence="9">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 49 average rating of the other nonverbal signals). Although the "hand raising" signal was not used as often as the signals for approval and disapproval (e.g., "thumb up/down" were frequently used in voting situations), it was perceived to be very helpful. Participants indicated approval of using avatars for representation in the CVE (M=6.7, SD=0.6, scale from 1 "absolutely not" to 7 "very much") as well as liking for the photo avatars (M= 5.7, SD=1.4, same scale). They did not regret the absence of a video representation of themselves and the others (M= 2.1, SD=1.2, same scale). Concerning social presence, the learners reported having felt rather present with the others at a remote (virtual) location (M=5.1, SD=1.2, scale from 1 "not at all" to 7 "very much"). Furthermore, the students gave 15-min presentations during the lecture in vitero. They reported being rather more nervous presenting face to face in comparison to presenting in the vitero system (M= 5.0, SD=1.8, scale from 1 "more nervous in vitero" to 7 "more nervous face to face"). The relatively high score of the SD shows that the perception of one's own nervousness in the situation also depends on other factors, for instance the personality of the user. Moreover, the users expressed that it was slightly irritating not to have the full range of nonverbal feedback from the listeners (e.g., concerning their attention and understanding; M— 4.4, SD=1.6, scale from 1 "not at all" to 7 "very irritating"). Not having the full range of nonverbal feedback available for monitoring the participants' state of attention and understanding is a critical aspect connected to the feeling of being aware of the activities of others (Dourish and Bellotti, 1992). Overall, the data of the two exploratory studies reveal that users not only appreciate but also actually use the different communication modes that are provided. In particular, facilitating turn-taking and feedback as well as guiding the learners by highlighting information are cited as the reasons for utilizing the nonverbal signals in learning situations. Experimental studies The following studies shed light on whether different forms of user representations are better suited to help structure interaction and lead to higher social presence. A recent experiment examined how users communicate via high-quality video images and basic graphical avatars in the form of gray robotic heads that display the gender and name of the user (Clayes and Anderson, 2007). The latter is a rather common way of representing users in desktop CVEs. Altogether, 72 participants took part in the study, interacting in three person groups in different contexts: two social exchange contexts, a map task, and a business meeting task. Communication analysis revealed that in the video condition, participants interrupted less than in the avatar condition. It can be concluded that video images have a positive influence on structuring interaction. Surprisingly, regarding social presence aspects as rated in a questionnaire (in line with Short et al. 1976, bipolar scales were used), the two conditions were not perceived very differently, for instance concerning sociability, warmth, and sensitivity of the communication medium. Moreover, the eye tracking data show that even basic types of avatars, as used in this study (without nonverbal signals etc.), are gazed at during remote interaction, especially in social exchange contexts. Salinas (2005) compared how communication modes affect performance and social presence. Social presence was measured with a bipolar seven-point scale consisting of 13 items (derived from Short et al. 1976). In total, 60 participants communicated in dyads either via text chat, audio-conference, or video-conference in a desktop CVE. Each subject was represented by a human-like, gender-specific avatar in Active Worlds. Subjects in the CVE text chat condition spent a longer time performing a decision-making task together and perceived less social presence than subjects in the CVE audio-conference or CVE *£) Springer</page><page sequence="10">50 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 video-conference condition, while the conditions CVE audio-conference and CVE video conference did not differ significantly. Salinas explains the non-significant results with the idea that the three-dimensional desktop CVE, in which the users were displayed as avatars, can probably compensate for the video channel. The non-significant time performance finding is consistent with other media experiments that compared audio and video without a CVE background (e.g., Olson et al. 1997; Kraut et al. 2003). In a recent study, Bente et al. (2008) varied the following communication modes: text chat, audio, audio-video, and avatar. The 150 participants involved were required to work in dyads on a management decision task. Social presence was measured by means of 58 five-point Likert scale items. Significant differences were found between text chat and all other communication modes in two of four social presence dimensions: perceived intimateness and spatial co-presence. The other two dimensions, behavioral contingency and social attentiveness, did not differ significantly. In another study, four mediated conditions were compared: video, audio-only, and two avatar conditions: one with informed gaze, where head animations were tracked and eye animations were related to turn-taking during the conversation, and one with random gaze, where head and eye animations were unrelated to conversational flow (Garau et al. 2001). The experiment was explicitly not conducted in the context of a CVE in order to isolate gaze behavior from other factors, such as spatial or gestural cues (cf. the compensation explanation of Salinas, 2005). The subjective responses of the 50 dyads were assessed concerning the extent to which the conversation was experienced as being similar to a real face-to-face conversation, involvement in the conversation, and social presence (measured on a nine-point Likert scale). Participants responded most favorably to video, followed closely by the inferred-gaze avatar condition. In general, the inferred-gaze avatar condition was rated better than the random-gaze avatar condition and the audio-only condition. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences between inferred-gaze avatar and video in terms of sense of involvement and similarity to face-to-face interaction. Regarding social presence, the score of the video condition was higher than all three other conditions. Garau et al. (2001) conclude that an avatar can contribute significantly to the positive perception of communication even if gaze is the only additional nonverbal signal. Moreover, the study shows that relating gaze behavior to the conversation provides a marked improvement as compared with an avatar that merely exhibits liveliness. This is in line with other studies varying eye-gaze conditions in immersive CVE (e.g., Bailenson et al. 2002; Guadagno et al. 2007). The results of the study again show that nonverbal signals have an impact on the perception of computer-mediated interaction. One can tentatively derive that they also play a role in establishing and maintaining the user's motivation in learning scenarios (Bromme et al. 2005). My own experiments again took place using a preliminary version of the vitero system (Allmendinger, 2005). One experiment was conducted with groups of three persons (81 male and 30 female participants; mean age, 23 years), while the other experiment used groups of six (114 male and 24 female participants; mean age, 23 years). As predicted and in line with other studies (Hiltz et al. 1986; Scheck et al. 2008; Siegel et al. 1986), the audio channel was used most often during collaboration in both experiments. In the conditions where the nonverbal signals were available, they were used significantly more often than the text channel. These findings indicate that the nonverbal signals are more easily generated and perceived than text messages. Moreover, they interfere less with verbal comments than text chat messages, since the usage is based on images and not on words (Mayer, 2001). However, the availability of nonverbal signals did not lead to a stronger feeling of social presence (measured with a scale consisting of five items that were rated on Springer</page><page sequence="11">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 51 seven-point Likert scales, e.g., impression of being in the same remote environment with others). Further research is necessary to identity factors that explain the heterogeneous results of the experimental studies concerning the influence of nonverbal signals on social presence. Discussion Influencing social presence in desktop CVEs is a complex issue. The reported studies show that providing the possibility to include nonverbal signals in the communication has an impact on the perception of computer-mediated interaction. One can tentatively derive that nonverbal signals also play a crucial role in structuring interaction and establishing and maintaining the user's motivation in learning scenarios. Nevertheless, the studies also show that the usage of nonverbal signals does not necessarily lead to stronger feelings of social presence. Moreover, one can summarize that there is currently no standard way of measuring social presence. Depending on the items that are included in questionnaires, scholars find different patterns in their results (e.g., Bente et al. 2008). In general, the empirical studies show that user representation and choice of communication channels are highly dependent on the envisioned collaboration and learning situation. The following aspects will be discussed concerning learning in desktop CVEs: avatars, communication channels, learning situation, and learner characteristics. The empirical studies show that relatively basic avatars, for example photo avatars (Allmendinger et al. 2007) or robotic heads displaying gender and name (Clayes and Anderson, 2007), can contribute to favorable perceptions of a virtual setting. The assessment of subjective measures has practical significance because acceptance of a CVE and positive interaction experiences are basic aspects that can influence how learning takes place in CVEs, as well as its connections to emotional and motivational aspects. Future research endeavors are necessary to fully understand what level of user representation is needed for specific types of learning situations and how user representation influences learning outcomes and processes as well as subjective variables. The studies have also shown that the mere addition of liveliness signals or communication channels (e.g., video instead of audio, Salinas, 2005) does not necessarily improve the communication situation due to split-attention effects (Garau et al. 2001). Future research should examine the following questions: What issues need to be considered as the integration of several channels of an individual's communication behavior becomes possible? How is the trade-off best met between enriching avatar communication and reducing the cognitive capacity necessary for sending and receiving signals from multiple channels? Social and computer scientists should continue to develop and examine new ways of transmitting nonverbal cues in CVEs. Universal and culturally specific aspects of nonverbal signals must also be considered (Matsumoto, 2006). In general, the adaptiveness of the provided set of communication modes to characteristics of the learning scenario (instructional aims, learner characteristics, etc.) seems to be an important precondition for learning to take place. Another important issue is the specific learning situation. Studies employing the same measures for different task types have shown that the use and impact of communication channels is highly task-dependent (Allmendinger, 2005; Clayes and Anderson, 2007; Peterson, 2006). This is in line with theoretical assumptions of the Media Richness Theoiy (Daft and Lengel, 1986) and the Task Media Fit Approach (McGrath and Hollingshead, 1993). Research should follow a multi-dimensional measures approach in assessing the Springer</page><page sequence="12">52 Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 learning situation including, for instance, participatory, interactive, social, cognitive, and teaching dimensions (Pozzi et al. 2007). Concerning learning in desktop CVEs, the use of room metaphors (e.g., round table instead of chairs facing a podium) and their influence on the perception of social presence is an additional research area. Moreover, pre-assigned roles in group settings have to be considered; for example, how can moderators structure group processes, and are there ways to assign roles that equalize participation? These questions are likely to lead to research areas that combine function-oriented technological approaches and instructional support issues. CSCL is often presented as a promising learning method. In addition to the question of whether or not this method leads to satisfying learning outcomes, it is also important to determine whether all participants benefit from collaboration in computer-mediated contexts. In particular, for the issue of social presence in synchronous CSCL settings, it can be derived from the study of Allmendinger et al. (2007) that it depends on the personality of the users, specifically their self-confidence or shyness, whether they prefer higher or lower levels of social presence. Being represented via video stream, for instance, can be too much exposure for some users. Providing the possibility to adapt the system to the aims, tasks, and preferences not only of a group, but also of the individual user, is an aim that needs to be met. Future studies should also take into account that learners' participation appears to depend on a variety of learner characteristics, such as gender, sociocultural background, computer skills, computer attitudes, popularity with classmates, and visual/verbal learning preference (Homer et al. 2008; Prinsen et al. 2007). When learning takes place in a CVE, computer skills can have a particularly strong influence on learning results. Initial studies show that learners perceive tiredness and ease-of-use differently depending on the input device used (e.g., joystick, mouse, keyboard) while learning in a desktop CVE (Mikropoulos and Strouboulis, 2004). Longitudinal approaches must shed light on whether these effects are enduring. However, these results again show that adaptability to the user's needs is a major concern not only for instructional communication, but also in terms of establishing user friendly virtual learning systems. Commentary by Alexander RenkI In the mainstream research on collaborative learning in computer-supported settings, the typical focus is on discourse processes, argumentation, mutual explanations, or information exchange processes and their impact on learning outcomes. Social factors that are closely related to motivation and emotion are sometimes considered (e.g., whether the group members contribute equally to the group exchange) but they are not central to the analyses of collaborative learning processes and outcomes. In addition, the analyses in CSCL studies usually focus exclusively on verbal utterances and the short-term acquisition of knowledge. Against this background, the present article makes an important contribution by highlighting very important issues that are usually neglected in CSCL, including the following examples: (a) Social aspects such as group awareness provide, for instance, important background information for initiating one's own appropriate communication behavior; (b) gestures and other nonverbal signals can foster the smooth flow of instructional communications, for example, by facilitating turn-taking; (c) the acceptance of learning environments for self regulated learning is often neglected even though it is very important for further engagement in learning environments; hence, it is important to know that participants like sessions if they have avatars and the possibility to use gestures in CVEs. Springer</page><page sequence="13">Educ Psychol Rev (2010) 22:41-56 53 Beyond these important contributions, there are, however, also some restrictions to be mentioned. First, the studies described do not assess learning outcomes, which are a central criterion for the effectiveness of instructional communications. Although nonverbal signals may have favorable effects on the communication flow, it is unclear to what extent and how knowledge acquisition is affected. Second, the presented studies usually focus on problem solving (i.e., work settings). Although problem-solving activities lead to some learning effects, there is nevertheless a difference between learning and problem-solving scenarios with respect to the main goal to be accomplished (i.e., solving a problem or fostering the learning outcomes of all group participants). Third, although "intuitively" it seems to be clear that, for example, social presence or communicative regulations by nonverbal signals are important determinants of learning, a theoretical rationale specifying how these social and communicative processes are related to knowledge construction processes is lacking. In order to close the gap between the more socially and communicatively oriented approach presented in this article and the research focusing on collaboration and learning outcomes, two suggestions can be made. First, it seems fruitful to combine CVEs research with research on the impact of pedagogical agents, which also create a type of social situation, on learning outcomes. Studies on pedagogical agents provide information about the links of communicative features (e.g., politeness) and learning outcomes (e.g., Wang et al. 2008). Second, recent research by Niickles, Wittwer, and colleagues (e.g., Wittwer et al. 2010) provides clear evidence that social information (here: information about the communication partner), cognitive processes in written communication planning, linguistic features of the communication, and learning processes are tightly interconnected. The types of analyses employed in this research program can serve as a template to integrate learning issues more completely into the CVEs research reported in this article. On the whole, the papers of this special issue are a first promising step in order to combine research approaches in such ways. References Allmendinger, K. (2005).
