Burger In journey high this In July archaeological in small 1974, the to Yauya, Peruvian town I set a off is circles, Andes. village well on a journey to Yauya, a village high in the Peruvian Andes. In archaeological circles, this small town is well known because of Julio Tellos 1919 discovery there of a large stela from the Chavin culture (900-200 b.c.), Peru s earliest civilization. As a grad- uate student in search of a doctoral dissertation topic, I was convinced that a sculp- ture of such fine quality and large size had to come from a major Chavin center in the area. A study of this center could shed light on the origins of Andean civilization during the first millennium b.c. At 10,731 feet above sea level, Yauya was beyond the limits of the road system, so after a 28-hour bus ride from Lima to San Luis, I rode a horse for another exhausting eight hours before reaching the town. Tello found the stela in the town s church. Pieces had been broken off so it could be , incorporated as part of the church's doorway. Although Tello believed it originally came from the archaeological site of Ichic Yauya, no one I spoke to had ever heard of the site. Tello had found only about half of the stela, but his protégé, Julio Espejo Nuñez, reported in 1964 that he had heard of a second piece, said to support the roof of a household in Yauya. When I first decided to go to Yauya, the village was no more to me than a point on a map. I was blissfully unaware that less than two years earlier it had been the scene of an uprising by Quechua-speaking peasant farmers against the local landowners. This inci- dent resulted in the decapitation of one of the town's distinguished citizens, the capture and torture of several others, the occupation of the town by insur- gents, and, eventually, the intervention of government troops whose actions resulted in the death of numerous farmers (estimates vary between five and 20, depending on whom one asks). Explanations for the unrest likewise vary. One suggests that the rural popu- lace was motivated by a belief that there were fishtakos in the town, light skinned, fair-haired anthropomorphic 62 Archaeology • November/December 2002</page><page sequence="2">creatures, usually indistinguishable from humans. Pishtakos were said to kill innocent farmers, then extract their fat for sale to the industrial world. Some villagers argue that this old folk belief was manipulated by Marxist activists who came to the Yauya area to promote radical social change among impoverished farmers. Whatever the reason for the uprising, the atmosphere in Yauya when I arrived there in 1974 was less than welcoming. More than once I heard the comment that the archaeological sites I was inter- ested in were located at high altitudes and would therefore be difficult to visit, but that my decapitated head could reach them without problem. Not sur- prisingly, people in Yauya were hesitant to provide food and lodging. Given the absence of hotels or restaurants, daily survival proved to be more difficult than I had anticipated. Ultimately, the col- laboration of Domingo Peña, a local teacher and farmer, and others made my short-term investigations possible, but it remained hard to imagine con- ducting a long-term project there. Moreover, my explorations, including surface reconnaissance at the Tambo site, from which some local people believed the Yauya stela had been brought, failed to reveal evi- dence of Chavin archi- tecture or cultural materials. Since there is no evidence that the mod- ern town of Yauya was occupied in antiquity, the stela was appar- ently dragged into the town and used in the construction of the Catholic church, later being deposited for safekeeping in an elementary school where it can be seen to this day. When I visited in 1974, I found the stone leaning against a school wall. The stela had been carved from a single block of white granite. It origi- nally measured over 12 feet long, 23 inches wide, and six inches thick; its original weight can be estimated at roughly two tons. It is one of the largest Chavin carvings known, considerably larger than the more famous Raimondi stone and Tello obelisk from the temple at Chavin de Huántar, an important site south of Yauya. Like these other sculp- tures, it is decorated with finely carved reliefs, but unlike them, these designs extend onto the two sides of the granite slab; the top and bottom and the back were left blank. The elaborate designs depict a supernatural cayman or crocodile, with powerful tail feathers, suggesting it could fly. The creature's strong water and underworld associations are indi- cated by use of fish vertebrae to repre- sent its central axis and by many fish shown swimming along its sides. There are also S-shaped patterns, motifs that often represent fur markings on Chavin jaguar depictions. In Chavin art, very few representations were carved on large blocks accompanied by only sub- sidiary figures, and this observation led scholars to conclude that the cayman was an important deity or major mythi- cal figure. Judging from the style of the carvings, I estimated that it was carved sometime between 500 and 300 b.c., but I had no idea where and why the stela might have been erected. After a few days, I left Yauya resigned to the fact that it was impossible to carry out my dissertation research there and that despite P risk, considerable I had made effort little and risk, I had made little progress in clarifying the ^ significance of the stela. Hfck Happy to depart Yauya with my head still mĚĚ attached, I decided ^Sr instead to carry out my doctoral work at Chavin de Huántar, the site of a large temple complex and town, both dating to the first millen- nium b.c. With its 50-foot- high stone-faced platforms, its maze of interior and under- ground passageways and its sunken circular and rectangular plazas, Chavin de Huántar has been recognized as one of Peru's most important archaeo- logical sites since the nineteenth cen- tury. Chavin de Huántar has over 150 sculptures adorning its platform walls and outdoor plazas, but none so large as the Chavin-style carving from Yauya. I never lost my curiosity about where the stela had come from and why a big piece of it ended up in Yauya. For the next two decades, questions concerning the Yauya stela continued to bother me and so I decided to return to Yauya in August 2001.

It depicts typical Chavin motifs, including a cayman or crocodile with tail feathers.

Through an informant he reported the discovery of a third frag- ment, which had been dragged by teachers and their students from the high-altitude site of Mon- tengayoc to the elementary school at Chincho, a vil- lage near Yauya. Soon after my return to Yauya, I vis- ited the elementary school in Chincho and found the new fragment leaning against its back wall. The fragment - three feet, five inches long, and 23 inches wide - was the other end of the sculpture found by Tello. Herrera's subse- quent visit to Monten- gayoc, however, yielded evidence of only post- Chavin occupation, and it was 4.3 miles from where, according to another infor- mant, the original fragment docu- mented by Tello had been recovered. Ultimately, Herrera reached no conclu- sion about where the Yauya stela had been originally displayed or why it had been carved. During my recent visit to Yauya, I was accompanied by Urfe Mancisisidor, a Yauya-born elementary school director with whom I had developed a close friendship during my work at Chavin de Huántar. By coincidence, the second fragment of the stela had been reported by Espejo to be located in Urfes family home, and he remembered the granite slab from his childhood. Yauya had changed much since my first visit. Not only was it accessible by road (a mere 27-hour trip by bus and truck from Lima), but there were restaurants, a small inn, telephones, and even a few color televisions. The fragment of the Yauya stone documented by Tello had been set in a special niche in the ele- mentary school wall and secured with iron bars. This time people were anx- ious to help me in my quest. At first, the search for the missing second frag- ment was disappointing. The roof at Urfe's home had been replaced long ago and no one remem- bered where the carved slab that once supported the roof beam had gone, fortunately, during our last day in Yauya, an old friend of Urfe s, Jorge Mel- garejo, told us there was a decorated slab in his par- ent's unoccupied home, but that no one had exam- ined it because it was in a room infested with wild bees. We decided to return after dark when the bees were asleep. Scraping off a thick accumulation of bee excrement and wax, we found the distinctive incised motifs of the Yauya stela. We immediately moved the sculpture into the patio and by candlelight pho- tographed and made rubbings of it. 64 Archaeology • November/December 2002</page><page sequence="4">The remote mountain village of Yauya, where the lower section of the stela was found In 1919. It was first incorporated into the town church's doorway, and later moved to the town's school. &amp; 3 CO J "S A JC £ I 3 O u The fragment measured 1 5 inches tall and 23 inches wide and, like the other pieces, six inches thick. While the upper portion of its face is well preserved, the lower portion is eroded as if it had been used as a grinding surface at some time in the past. One side is preserved and fea- tures the distinctive S-shaped design known from the original piece. We could discern the eye of the cayman, a portion of its fanged mouth, and the first of the drum- shaped vertebrae of the cayman s back- bone. Despite some minor discrepancies in measurements, this piece was clearly the one Espejo reported, judging from the drawing that accompanied his 1964 report. We left the fragment with Jorge at his parents' house, but we hope that one day it can be joined with the Yauya and Chincho fragments. The three pieces of the stela that have been located comprise over 90 percent of the original sculpture. The search for the source of the Yauya stela proved more difficult than the hunt for the missing fragments. The known large highland Chavin centers in Peru such as Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa are located in rich agricultural lands of the quechua zone (5,900- 10,500 feet above sea level) and not on the steep high-alti- tude lands of the suni (10,500-12,500 feet above sea level) or the vast pasture- lands of the puna (12,500-13,800 feel above sea level), so our initial effort was to locate sites in the lands below the town of Yauya, or lower than 10,731 feet. But, in these areas, locations usually selected for Chavin centers were remark- ably scarce, and their remains were mainly limited to agricultural terracing. I turned my attention to the high-alti- tude farmlands above Yauya where the original Tello fragment and the one now in Chincho were both found. Thanks to Urfe's contacts in Yauya, I was able to find people who knew the history of both fragments. Maximo Benites farms lands in the site known as Tambo or Tambo Real de Huancabamba. Located at 11,654 feet above sea level, this area once served as a way station, or tambo , along the Inka highway connecting the Yauya area with the Huari area to the south during the fifteenth and early six- teenth century a.D. Most of this com- plex has been dismantled over the last two centuries and its fine stone blocks reused in the town below. An Inka structure incorporating finely worked stones is still visible at Tambo, and cut and polished rectangular stone blocks (known as ashlars) can be seen eroding into the stream that cuts through the site. In Yauya, at diverse places such as the market, an old hacienda, and the church, I was shown more than three dozen ashlars and lintels all made of the same fine-grained volcanic rock; all were said to have been brought from Tambo. Benites says that his parents often showed him exactly where in their fields at Tambo Tello's fragment had been found. It had been discovered, he said, just below the surface while cultivating. When the local landowner insisted it www.archaeology.org 6^</page><page sequence="5">The site of Quellcayrumi, which means "rock with drawing" in Quechua, where the Yauya stela may have originally been displayed within a Chavin shrine.

He had no idea what happened to the small, dislodged fragment. I was unable to find evidence of pre-Inka remains despite heavy erosion at Tambo pro- duced by the river. I made a second excursion with another farmer, Jesus Morales Solis, to the high-altitude archaeological site of Quellcayrumi. According to Morales, he discovered the top of the engraved stone now in the Chincho school while plant- ing potatoes in July 1991. It was located about six inches below the surface and he had to dig down five feet to get it out of the ground. Morales was indignant that the stone had been moved to Chin- cho without permission or compensa- tion. The spot where he found the frag- ment was at 12,557 feet above sea level. The name of the area in which the field is located, Quellcayrumi, can be trans- lated from Quechua as "rock with draw- ing." The presence of prehistoric wall fragments visible just beneath the sur- face lends credibility to Morales' account, but the ceramics in this and the adjoining fields clearly post-dated the Yauya stela. It is important to note that the site of Montengayoc mentioned by Herrera as the source of the Chincho fragment, is located south along the same ridge as Quellcayrumi and about a 1 5 minute walk away. At first blush, the findings seem only to deepen the enigma of the Yauya stela. The two large pieces of the two- ton stela appear to have been found far apart - Tambo Real de Huancabamba and Quellcayrumi are three to four hours walk from each other. Moreover, neither of the two sites shows evidence of having a Chavin occupation, nor is there evidence of other Chavin sites in the immediate area. Can the apparently contradictory evidence be reconciled? Based on the available data, I believe that the stela came originally from a small high-altitude Chavin shrine that was built at Quellcayrumi during the second half of the first millennium b.c. Like the Tello obelisk at Chavin de Huántar, the stela could have served as . a cult object venerated during religious ceremonies. When Quellcayrumi became a village during the first millen- nium a.D., the stela was broken and reutilized in the residential architec- ture, in the same way that some Chavin 66 Archaeology • November/December 2002</page><page sequence="6">&amp; 3 00 J 1 X s gs ť 3 O U sculptures were incorporated into later walls at Chavín de Huántar. Following Quellcayrumi's abandonment, perhaps around A.D. 700, the fragmented Yauya stela was forgotten, at least until Inka times, when a portion of it was encoun- tered and hauled away to the imperial way station being built to the south. The work of bringing this cut and pol- ished sculpture fragment to Tambo Real de Huancabamba would have been less than that necessary to pro- duce an ashlar of comparable size and quality. The other large fragment would have remained undisturbed five more centuries until it was encountered just beneath the surface in 1991 by a local farmer and brought down to Chincho for display. While not the only possible sce- nario, this is plausible. High-altitude Chavín shrines, such as the one pro- posed for Quellcayrumi, are known from near Chavín de Huántar. In 1975-1976, I excavated at two of these, Pojoc (12,630 feet above sea level) and Waman Wain (11,480 feet above sea level). Surface ceramics of the Chavín culture were rare or absent, and these sites came to the attention of archaeologists because of the reuse of Chavín stone carvings by later occu- pants. At both sites, Chavín occupa- tions were eventually identified deep beneath the constructions of later cul- tures. At these two high-altitude sites, there were Chavin-style sculptures, some virtually indistinguishable from those employed in the famous Chavín de Huántar temple itself, while others were carved in a more rustic style. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that a high-altitude Chavín shrine, particu- larly one of special ritual importance, could have displayed a sculpture such as the Yauya stela. In terms of the local geography, the impressive setting of Quellcayrumi is reminiscent of Pojoc. Its location is particularly dramatic because it is on a crest overlooking the deeply incised valley lands to the east, west, and north. The existence of high- altitude shrines during the first millen- nium B.c. underlines the importance of high-altitude activities such as tuber agriculture and llama herding in the Chavín economy, as well as the central role of religious ceremony and ideology in integrating these areas with the set- tlements located at lower elevations. Fortunately, my second trip to Yauya had been blessed with much more suc- cess than the first. I located the second fragment of the stela at long last, and developed a plausible explanation of where the sculpture had originally been displayed. However, only more inten- sive fieldwork including excavations at Quellcayrumi, will be able to resolve the questions raised by the remarkable and enigmatic Yauya stela. During my last visit, the people in Yauya were talking about setting up a local museum, and a building in the cen- ter of town had already been selected. Obviously, the reassembled Yauya stela would be the high point of such an insti- tution. I remain intrigued with the enigma of the Yauya stela and hope some day in the not-too-distant future to return to Quellcayrumi to test my sce- nario with excavations at the site. ■ Richard L.
