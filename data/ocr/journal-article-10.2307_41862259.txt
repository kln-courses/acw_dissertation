<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELEVANCE OF FEDERAL TAX REFORM: COMMENT JAMES M. VERDIER I answer am going to one to try of to the give questions a tentative that answer to one of the questions that Professor McDaniel posed, which is: Why haven't these data on effective rates seemed to provide much steam for tax reform? Let me begin with an even more sweep- ing caveat than the people from Treasury gave. Not only is this not necessarily the view of the CBO - it is not even necessari- ly my own view. It is in the nature of a tentative thesis based on ten or a dozen years of looking at and listening to politi- cians and their constituents. The basic proposition - perhaps an heretical one - is that people don't really care what taxes other people pay. They only care about their own taxes. If some- one else is getting a tax break that they can argue they are also entitled to, they will be interested in that, but that is about the extent of their curiosity about other people's taxes. Normal people don't normally know what other people's taxes are. It is not a general staple of conversation. They never see these tax burden tables that we see, so they don't know what taxes people at different income levels pay. They also have very individualistic, idiosyncratic notions of equity. They have little theoretical notion of what a proper tax system ought to be. They are mainly interested in paying lower taxes, and some of the special provisions they suggest to accomplish this would appall many of the people in this room. I have a suspicion that most people don't even believe in a progressive tax system. I think most people believe in a flat rate system. If I had a nickel for every letter I have seen over the last ten years from a constituent saying, "Hey! I have a great idea. Let's just have a flat 10 percent tax on everybody," I would probably have a corner on the world market for nickels. They don't believe, I think, what Ben Okner believes - that everybody who has the same income should pay pretty much the same tax - so no matter what else there is about their circumstances that might affect their ability to pay. I think people generally believe that people with the same ability to pay taxes ought to pay pretty much the same tax, but they measure that ability by a lot of things other than income. They measure it by family size, by whether there are unusual expenses for medical or child care, by whether a tax- payer is old or infirm, or halt, or lame, or whatever. They also believe - or have been led to believe - that they are entitled to special tax breaks for everything from buying insulation to taking the bus to work in the morning. I think people take all these things into account, at least implicitly, in deciding what taxes people ought to pay. So they are not astonished by the fact that the taxes paid by people in the same income class vary a great deal. In looking at specific exemptions or deductions, people do make some rough judgments about whether or not they are appropriate. But these judgments are based on very general notions of fairness and equity, and there is a very great tolerance for things that sound OK on their face. There is no particular theory against which specific provisions are test- ed. People are not very critical of the tax breaks others are getting. They don't think it costs them anything, and they often think they may be able to benefit from it themselves at some point. I think you see that same absence of theory in the case of business taxes. There is a lot of agitation for a "progressive" corporate income tax, reflecting perhaps a notion that little corporations are like little poor people and big corporations are like big rich people. The small business lobby is especially prone to this kind of mindless anthropomorphism. But I don't think they really believe that. I think it is really just a gimmick to justify lower taxes. I don't think they are committed 419</page><page sequence="2">420 NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL [Vol. XXXII to any particular theory of what a proper corporate tax should look like. They are simply looking for a device that will lower their taxes, and they will take it in any form they can get it. If all this is true - or even partly true - where does it leave us in terms of a strategy for tax reform? As Jere Brannon is going to argue, and as Paul McDaniel mentioned in his pre- sentation, there is something of a break- down in the professional consensus on what a "proper" tax system should be. Should we have the comprehensive Haig-Simons system, in which all income is taxed - from whatever source derived - or should we go to a consumption or expenditure tax which does not put as great a tax burden on savings? It is difficult, intellectually, to come up with a view of what a proper, just tax system ought to be. We may be in a transition period now in which the most that can be done is to head off further bad tax expenditures or tax gimmicks and perhaps undo some of the more egregious of the existing ones. If that is the case, I think you have to simply look at each of these provisions one-by-one. Is it fair? Is it equitable? Does it accurately reflect ability to pay? If you are talking about an explicit tax subsidy or incentive, does it do what it is supposed to do? Is it effective? Is its cost fairly reasonable? Does it benefit the right people? We are starting to do this now in a number of areas. One caveat I should mention about tax expenditure analysis is that, generally, it seems not to work to say direct programs are better. In the direct programs that we have studied at the CBO - real estate tax shelters to subsidize construction of low-income ren- tal housing; basic education opportunity grants to subsidize college tuition; HUD programs to subsidize single-family hous- ing; subsidies for health insurance - the direct expenditure programs have many of the same problems that the tax expenditures do. They are doing things that are not terribly sensible. They cost a lot, and they are not very efficient. Take a look at tax-exempt housing bonds. We are appalled that only 40 or 50 percent of that subsidy gets to the ostensible beneficiary; but if you are dealing with HUD , 40 or 50 percent looks pretty good! Or take a look at tax-exempt industrial development bonds, and all of the margin- al things that they are used for - parking garages, sports stadiums, a string of Mc- Donalds in Pennsylvania financed with small-issue IDB's - it looks pretty bad. But then you take a look at what is being done with UDAG and EDA grants. It is the same sort of thing; and you have to ask yourself, "Are these direct expendi- tures so wonderful?" I think you have to confront the tax expenditures head-on, and ask if, on their own merits, they make that much sense. It is getting hard to argue that direct expenditure programs are a better al- ternative. So I think that we must simply look, on a case-by-case basis, at selected tax expenditures, and we should pay special attention to the newly proposed ones, be- cause it is always easier to head those off. Are they efficient? Do they do what they are supposed to do? Can they be administered through 1RS more easily than through a new bureau- cracy? Sometimes, if you just want to hand out money without any strings, the Inter- nal Revenue Code is not a bad way of doing it. The 1RS works better than a lot of the other bureaucracies around town. The final point I think we need to make clear, in all cases, is that handing out money through a tax expenditure must always be traded off against a general tax cut, or indexing the individual income tax for inflation. We are now in a situation where, if inflation continues, there is going to be a tax cut every couple of years - whether we call it indexing or not. It will at least be a kind of ad hoc indexing. A certain amount of tax money is going to be handed back to people every couple of years. Every time money is handed back in a special</page><page sequence="3">No. 3] WOODWORTH MEMORIAL SYMPOSIUM 421 way, it means there is that much less to hand back in a general way. I think the budget process will pose that choice most starkly. This can be another one of the grounds to fight on in this transition stage. The ground of effective rates is eroding beneath our feet. We need some better alternatives. With that, let me see if I can escape without being hanged.</page><page sequence="4">PROFESSOR certainly escape SURREY: without Well, you being can certainly escape without being hanged!
