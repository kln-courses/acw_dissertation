<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL COOK: Commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought. xvii, 702 pp. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. ?54.95. The quranic precept of 'Commanding right and forbidding wrong' (al-amr bi'l-ma'rfif wa'l-nahy 'an al-munkar) has had a wide-ranging and lasting impact on Islamic religious, legal and political thought. Its universal ethical appeal together with its lack of specific focus invited discussion of its practical significance and efforts to derive concrete norms from it in different spheres of life. The present study traces the evolution of this impact, in the context of Quran exegesis, hadTth, early biographical literature and of the major legal, theological and sectarian school traditions, through the ages to contemporary treatment. Close attention is paid to reports on cases of actual practice, although, as the author notes, much less is generally recorded about the practice than the theory. In the concluding chapters, the perspective .is broadened beyond the frame of Islam in thought-provoking comparative discussion as to how the issues raised by the precept have been approached in other religious and cultural traditions. Altogether the book is exemplary both in the comprehensive and perceptive treatment of its subject and the meticulous evaluation of the broad range of accessible sources. While it may be too detailed to be fully read by most students of Islam, it will, no doubt, become a standard reference work in Islamic studies.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 149 A few of the author's interpretations and conclusions may be questioned. He describes Ahmad b. Hanbal, on the basis of his pronouncements concerning the precept, as a pious quietist who 'stood for unhesitating obedience to the ruler', while keeping his distance from government. 'He was ready to render unto Caesar the things which were Caesar's; beyond that, what he asked most of all was to be left alone' (p. 113). Ibn Hanbal's quietism, according to Cook's interpretation, contrasted sharply with the militant activism that characterized much of later Hanbalism. The activist moralist Ibn Taymiyya, 'in condemning the quietist variety of moralism, ... was dissociating himself from something perilously close to the attitude of the founder of the school' (p. 157). In thus presenting Ibn Hanbal as a withdrawn quietist on the basis of his stand on cases of morality, Cook plays down counter-evidence and ignores the distinct strain of zealotry in his religious make-up which expressed itself in his obsessive pursuit of 'innovations' in matters of dogma and belief. The comparison of his attitude to government with the Christian 'giving Caesar his due' is quite out of place in an Islamic context where the caliph is the head of Islam whose foremost duty is to promote and defend the orthodox faith, not a remote emperor to whom one pays tax while considering him irrelevant to the spiritual Kingdom of God. Ibn HIanbal never had any doubt that the caliph should do everything in his power to suppress heresy and that the faithful should aid him in this. His predicament was that the caliphs during the mihna rather espoused what he viewed as heresy. His religious attitude thus was not so remote from later HIanbalite militancy as Cook suggests. It is true that he would hardly have approved the rabble rousing activity of al-Barbahari and his like. Yet he would certainly have appreciated the successful efforts of the later Hanbalites of Baghdad to press the caliphs to adopt the Qadiriyya creed in pursuit of their own mihna against heretics. Difficult to understand is Cook's judgement that the charges of anthropo- morphism levelled by most Sunnis against the early HIanbalites were unfounded allegation and calumny, a calumny which the prominent Hanbalite theologian Ibn al-Jawzi upheld against his own school (p. 142). H. Laoust and others have argued that the polemical name mushabbiha should not be applied to the early Hanbalites since it was resented and thrown back at their opponents by them. The term anthropomorphism, however, is primarily descriptive, and it cannot be denied that the Quran and hadith contain anthropomorphic expressions whose literal acceptance, whether accompanied by the famous formula of bi-la kayf or not, inevitably entails an anthropomorphic concept of God. That Ibn Hanbal and his early school, with the exception of Ibn al-Jawzi, were the main advocates of the literal acceptance of these anthropomorphisms has been reaffirmed by D. Gimaret in his recent study of the treatment of the anthropomorphisms in hadith in early Islamic theology (Dieu a l'image de l'homme, Paris, 1997, p. 2). Ibn al-Jawzi should be commended for his honesty in this respect, not charged with calumniating his own school. Dealing with the Ismaili attitude to the precept, Cook refers to the creed Tij al-'aqa 'id of the Yemenite Tayyibi da'T mutlaq Muhammad b. 'Ali b. al-Walid, who states that the duty of forbidding wrong is to be performed by al-'ulamd' dina ghayrihim. Cook interprets this as meaning 'the scholars, to the exclusion of others' and comments that 'we have here an unabashed assertion of clerical authority scarcely paralleled elsewhere' (p. 304, see also p. 472). In support of this interpretation he quotes W. Ivanow's comment on the statement that it was 'intended to uphold the interests of the priestly class'. This interpretation is, however, hardly tenable in view of Ibn al-Walid's</page><page sequence="3">150 REVIEWS later statement that 'the believer' (mu'min) is obligated (quoted by Cook in n. 341). Ismailis did not recognize a class of' ulamd' distinct from ignorant laymen as it existed in Sunnism and Twelver Shiism. There was a teaching hierarchy, but if Ibn al-Walid had intended to restrict the duty to its higher ranks, he would no doubt have spoken of hudizd or du'dt. The mu'min in Ibn al-Walid's usage was the initiated Ismaili, who was by definition 'alim, in contrast to the uninitiated Muslim, who was ignorant in religion. Ibn al-Walid's statement is thus merely a parallel to the common doctrine that only those who know the religious law must practise the precept. P. 21, n. 21: The interpretation of 'Banut Hashim' in the exegesis transmitted by al-Kalbi as the Abbasids is anachronistic. In early Islam Banli Hashim meant the whole clan of Muhammad, including Talibids, Abbasids and others. Pp. 204-5: Abui 'I-Husayn al-Basri should not be viewed as a member of the school of 'Abd al-Jabbar, even though he was a pupil of his. He was recognized as the founder of a separate school by the Mu'tazila as well as their opponents. His Tasaffuh al-adilla cannot be the source of Ibn al-Malahimi's treatment of al-amr bi'l-ma'riif (as suggested on p. 218) since it was left incomplete by the author and did not reach the topic. W.
