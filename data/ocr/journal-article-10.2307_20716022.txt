<plain_text><page sequence="1">Children's Drawings as "Artistic Development:" Art Education's Conceptual Twilight Zone Philip William Pearson University of Canterbury Abstract The last twenty years saw a marked shift in thinking about the drawing of children as a kind of development. From an issue of cognition or affect for much of its theorized history, children's drawing moved, noiselessly, to new conceptual premises; into the construction of a kind of human development called "artistic". Contemporary theory in artistic development seems to differ radically from earlier models of development in accommodating the diversity of strategies and purposes evident in children's image making. This paper examines the recent proposal of Anna Kindler and Bernard Darras to clarify the radical credentials specific to this kind of theory and, as well, to challenge the lease of the notion of 'artistic development'. Introduction Our thinking about children's drawing as an entity in its own right has a history of less than two hundred years. Virtually all of that history has construed the entity as a natural kind. In the mid-nineteenth cen tury such a view was radical (e. g., Spen cer, 1882/1854; Topffer, 1907/1847). It di rectly opposed the normative view that the kind of drawing which counted was adult derived; specifically it opposed the entity of drawing embodied within the Kensington System as the first state attempt to engage children in drawing practice on a massive scale. By the mid-twentieth century the view that children's drawing was a natural en tity was the normative view. It was sup ported by a substantial body of literature revealing the relationships between the patterns of change which could be found in drawings with the physiological and psy chological patterns of change evident in the growth of children. Those relationships constituted laws to be followed by the en tity of drawing which were aligned to laws followed in the physiological growth of per ception, of cognitive growth or of affective growth. Children's drawing was part of the way children developed. Contention arose in locating the real essence of drawing within one or other of the identifiable ele ments of general development but any ex planation presented covered all drawings made by children. At the close of the twentieth century it is not tenable to presume that all drawings made by children can be covered by a single or essential explanation. Which is to say that the notion of drawing as a natu ral kind has, seemingly, become over whelmed by research in which social and cultural factors account for what children do in drawings. They override "universally innate" factors (Hamblen, 1985) or they mediate them (Kindler, 1993; Kindler &amp; Darras, 1994,1997,1998). Lineal progress into a single, generalized, graphic system (such as pictorial realism) is no longer as sumed. Drawings reveal widening reper toires of representational systems (Wolf, 1994; Wolf &amp; Perry, 1988) in which diverse "drawing discourses" have logics specific to the uses for which children employ marks in the act of drawing (Atkinson, 1991). Diana Korzenik's (1981,1990,1995) his tory of theorizing children's drawing sug gests that what is recognized as significant in children's images corresponds with what is recognized as significant within art gen erally. Thus, it should offer no surprise that the kind of work currently dominant within 60 VISUAL ARTS RESEARCH ? 2002 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">that field is consistent with postmode? : ,u? ceptions of artworks and their production (eg, Pariser, 1997a). On the face of it, this work presents a radical challenge to explic itly nomological research and theory. It of fers the possibility of a new kind of knowl edge about drawings; one consistent with the demands of a trajectory for art educa tion theory which acknowledges the con testable nature of art as a part of social life. Those demands, however, might also give shape to a new rhetoric with which to re present existing claims for art educations founded on the natural status of the draw ings of children. Contemporary Theorizing About Drawing In this sense, a new context has emerged for theorizing children's drawings removed from the search for explicitly natural laws with which to explain their existence, but unconnected with existing ideographic re search and theory of children's drawings (the search for the reasons and motives of children in producing drawings in order to better understand them). Work belonging within this context sepa rates the task of making drawing develop ment intelligible from any explicitly biologi cal determinism of general child develop ment. Instead, the ways in which drawings can be said to develop within children's graphic activities are employed to explicate the existence of a further, distinctly speci fiable (but no less universally applicable), kind of development; namely, of an "artis tic development". This exists as part of "art" and therefore explanations of it are sub ject to concerns of "culture". As a new context for theorizing, there are advances beyond nomological ideas to celebrate. Not least of which is the ero sion of the long held interconnection of graphic skill with cognitive competence; an erosion punctuated in Golomb (1993) de claring the concept "cognitive immaturity" unsatisfactory for classifying the graphic efforts of children. Moreover, elucidating the kmds of choices children make within graphic behavior is incompatible with in quiry which would elucidate rules govern ing children's graphic behavior. However, the conceptual relationship formed in at tempting to integrate explicitly nomologi cal premises with socio/cultural forces is, at best, ambivalent. The implications of such ambivalence become clearer through examining one substantial account of drawing to emerge from the context, that produced by Anna Kindler and Bernard Darras (1994, 1997, 1998). For the purposes of this paper the account has the virtue of attempting a co herent and comprehensive reform of the theoretical ground which produced stage based accounts. The way they go about such reform helps to reveal conceptual dif ficulties inherent to the project of making the notion of artistic development intelli gible. Kindler and Darras: Mapping Diverse Graphic Trajectories to Plot Artistic Development The task is to map the multiple trajectories of drawing strategies pursued by children in order to produce a logically coherent model for a socio/biological process of ar tistic development. To do this the model abandons biological process as its central analogy in favor of semiotic process, that constructed by C. S. Peirce (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1994,1997), and the developmen tal model employed to explain how diverse graphic trajectories can unfold simulta neously through acquiring multiple kinds of graphic strategies moves from Piaget to Vygotsky (1994, 1997; Kindler, 1993, 1995). Within semiotic process, drawings are construed to be signs and become ac countable in terms of the categories of Peirce's triadic relationship of "symbol", "icon" and "index". The entity of drawing is subsumed within explanation of the logi cal functioning of these aspects of signs. Artistic development becomes known when Drawing as Development 61</page><page sequence="3">the possible relationships between the semiotic functions of drawings are ac counted for in a manner which shows the diverse possibilities of their evolution; when we see, in other words, the interrelation ship of generic consistencies in drawings (termed 'generic iconicity') with diverse social and cultural possibilities in graphic resources and choices inducing multiple graphic developmental trajectories. In short, they attempt an explanation of the logical possibilities of development in drawing available to children. The complete map of such possibilities models the exist ence of artistic development. The Use and Misuse of Theoretical Resources Semiotic process should present nominal kind status for drawing which would be consistent with conceiving of drawings in social and cultural terms. Indeed, Peirce's semiotics could allow the graphic strate gies used by children to be apprehended as belonging within systems of significa tion and not just within systems of com munication (which require communicative intentions). So drawing could be appre hended as an entity within truly cultural systems?as in, for example, Barthes' (1984) "fashion system", or Bourdieu's (1984,1990a) descriptions of the relations of symbolic capital and social practice without assuming those systems should behave like natural languages (Gottdiener, 1995). Kindler and Darras (1998), however, construct their model upon the belief that all representational activity shares a communication potential. Whether it is conveying thoughts, ideas, facts, emotions, states, understandings, or interpretations, communication occurs through the use of icons, indexes and sym bols, which, according to Peirce, consti tute components of signs (p. 148). On this view "drawing" is "representing" because drawings can always communi cate something. It follows that that commu nication is what children always intend since it is the necessary condition for connecting representational activity and drawings as something which can be found to develop in children. This is reinforced by account ing for the different sorts of communicative intentions children have (such as wanting to narrate a story rather than to describe an object) as a "taxonomy of teleologies" (p. 166). That is, children employ particular graphic strategies in making drawings be cause they know those strategies will achieve particular kinds of representation which enable particular kinds of communi cation. On this reasoning the existence of these kinds of communication causes graphic strategies to exist and causes the use of them by children. It is reasonable to speculate that chil dren have some knowledge of the kind of representation their graphic efforts consti tute. Which is to say that children can know what they want to do and quite often the result of what they do will be consistent with their intentions. We can say as much for virtually all human action. However the kind of representation we can, and do, ascribe to the residues of children's involvement in graphic activity is just one functional expla nation we could give for their involvement. Furthermore, the notion that children intend to communicate through a specific kind of graphic representation is not a necessary condition for such involvement. Which is to say that representation, of any kind, can only be claimed as the necessary end goal of children's drawing activity by denying the possibility of any other kind of purpose chil dren might have for the activity. This is not, of course, to say that chil dren do not pursue particular graphic strat egies because they want to make particu lar kinds of drawings. However, it is a clas sic teleological fallacy to assume that an effect (however beneficial) of a practice can, unproblematically, be construed to explain why the practice occurred. Certainly, the insight that children do have interests in their graphic activity which are significant to explaining it is important; albeit, if only taken with respect to explain ing diverse graphic strategies within that activity. In nomological terms, however, this 62 Philip William Pearson</page><page sequence="4">insight is unsatisfactory because no gov erning or causal mechanism can be drawn from notions as fluid in meaning as Inter ests" and "intentions". These count among what Locke (1948/1690) termed "nominal essences" as arbitrary or '"typical" proper ties which amount to no more than conve nient criteria for recognizing an entity (which might or might not be a natural kind) in con trast with "real essences" which exist as in trinsic properties; "the very essentia or be ing of the thing itself; that foundation from which all its properties flow, and to which they are all inseparably annexed" (p. 213). The interests and intentions of children, in their arbitrary guise, cannot, thus, be of fered as antecedent conditions for the ex istence of diverse graphic strategies mani fest in drawings. However, they might prove useful to that end if they can be given an other guise by unifying their arbitrary char acter within a generic, goal- directed, and self-perpetuating system; a system from which all properties of drawings flow and to which they are all inseparably annexed. Kindler and Darras (1988) do just that with what they call the "teleology of represen tation" (p. 150). Doing so transforms their construal of early drawing activity?as "pluri-media" within the context of children's active choices and intentions?into a system which transcends the cultural and social. Their will to do that makes sense with re spect to following questions central to the nomological orientation towards explaining the kinds of things children's drawings are: namely the establishment of necessary and sufficient antecedent conditions for their existence. It also makes sense with respect to a model of semiotic process viewed as articulating the essential, universal, nature of signs; a "formal doctrine" of the laws of logic itself (Peirce, 1955) which constitutes what can possibly be real as well as what is real. This potential led Habermas (1972) to designate Peirce's general theory of signs as a "concealed or scholastic real ism"; "The basic assumption of nominal ism is inconsistent with Peirce's concept of reality" (p. 107). Children's drawings are conceived nominally (as diverse socially and cultur ally embedded "species" of representa tions; a collection of volatile nominal es sences of drawing) but the entity of draw ing is generically unified (the "genus" of those species); an entity possessing an assumed real essence which exists beyond the "conscious dimension" (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1998, p. 151). In other words, draw ing is a natural kind entity moderated and mediated through the vagaries of social and cultural forces to induce diversity (or even extinction) in its products. Semiotic process replaces biological process to explain artistic development but an innate ontology for drawing is retained. Their conception of the presence of such a semiotic process in children is akin to the Kantian notion of possessing a "common sense" of the universal state of nature which is opposed by social and cultural subjectivities. The diversity of drawing strategies employed by children is no more than the diverse possibilities of such sub jective factors upon universal activity. The argument for innateness is not undermined by recognition that sometimes it is pre vented from developing. In short, their model presents a conceptual scheme for drawing consistent with Chomsky's (1972) argument for linguistic universals which overrides any claims it implies towards socio/cultural constructionism. However, this is the case for the entire context. Children's drawings can provide a natu ral kind foundation for explaining the ge neric entity "drawing" so long as they are held to show evidence of the presence of some property cluster (such as "generic iconicity") and thus evidence of an "under lying homeostatic mechanism" (Boyd, 1984): a mechanism which maintains the characteristics of the entity of drawing in a relatively steady state and which is caus ally related to the property cluster claimed to exist in drawings. The status of natural kind is upheld in maintaining that drawings, as a kind, possess a characteristic pattern of change; a pattern typical of the kind and unique to it?one of the primary intuitive Drawing as Development 63</page><page sequence="5">criteria for identifying natural kinds (Keil, 1989). Patterns of change in drawings causally relate to the "real" essence of drawing. Moreover, claims for the existence of such an essence enable the further claim that drawing exists as a generic or norma tive kind of development. On the Track of Drawing's Real Essence Through a Bending Terrain of Development Strongly developmental drawing theory tends toward early childhood since patterns of change are considerably less reliable further into middle childhood; a change which itself is made sensible (as a natural kind) through arguing the existence of a "U curve" in drawing development (e.g., Davis, 1997; Gardner, 1980; Rosenblatt &amp; Winner, 1988). That argument carries the demand that a real "artistic" essence exists in drawings until around five years of age, disappears and re-emerges (occult-like) in adoles cence as the precursor for properly adult artistic practice. Eisner (1976), without con tributing to the argument for a "U-curve", clearly describes the logic of the artistic end ascribed for it within Project Zero. The end stage of development is latent and of secondary importance in the previous stages of development ... one that focuses on the aesthetic and expres sive aspects of the work that is done. This "aesthetic-expressive" stage begins dur ing early adolescence, and only a small percentage of children acquire the skill necessary to realize it in its full blown form. When we remember what gives the arts their special power is the artist's ability to construct and organize form in a way that embodies and therefore conveys the feel ing he is interested in articulating, it be comes clear that this stage gets to the heart of artistic expression. By itself there is no artistic virtue in representational drawing, even when the images are hyperrealistic. Such skill manifests itself only as technique, and, while technique is a necessary condition for the creation of art, it is not sufficient (p. 10). The "aesthetic-expressive" essence amounts to the selected "virtuous" modern ist artistic values the U-curve is charged with asserting (Duncum, 1986a; Korzenik, 1995; Pariser &amp; van den Berg, 1997; Wohlwill, 1985). However, Eisner's general sense of whatever is deemed sufficient for legitimate artistic practice beyond "mere" technique accommodates modern and postmodern artistic virtue and this sense is, perhaps, best described by Lee Emery (1989) as the acquisition of a specific "be lief" in properly artistic making and think ing: "abstract and metaphoric forms of ar tistic expression could only be achieved if the child was prepared to believe implicitly in the evocative capacity of the art medium" (p. 241). The logic of the "U-curve" conflates hon orific understandings of certain kinds of adult (mature) artistic practice (construed dispositionally) with nomological accounts of patterns of change in children's graphic products in order to articulate a beginning, a middle and an end for a process of de velopment. Such logic is necessary sim ply because articulating a process for ar tistic development is meaningless without the existence of an end point of "being" ar tistically developed. The actual graphic practices of children belie such theoretical convenience (Duncum, 1986b; Pearson, 1993a, 1993b) but inasmuch as the choices children make about image making activity follow a sem blance of pattern, the logic of theorizing it as development can be maintained; so long as it can also be maintained that the only end point of development that matters is the disposition to pursue adult fine art prac tices. In turn, that can be maintained only as long as the manifest end point of almost all children's "artistic development", which is not to be disposed to pursue fine art prac tices, is construed as systematic develop mental failure rather than as ordinary hu man agency. It matters little within this logic whether the failed system is biological, cul tural, or a bit of both. An interesting perspective on the "U curve" arises when we relate, as Strommen 64 Philip William Pearson</page><page sequence="6">(1988) suggests, "artistic development" with other sorts of development, in order to better understand the former. The pat tern of choice about image making activ ity, described in the "curve" of the "U", seems to correlate with change in the orientation of children toward strategic peer interaction during middle childhood (Thompson et al, 1995). Which is to say that changes in children's "social" percep tions might provide a more substantial ex planation for the well documented shift to ward socially valued and readily available image making conventions; as gaining skills to recognize the kinds of graphic skills worth pursuing but, more importantly, to recognize viable reasons for pursuing them. These are decisions. They are not grown, they are taken. Children who avoid all involvement in graphic activity become significant on this perspective beyond the simplistic assertion that the latter must be caused by their fail ure to properly develop appropriate graphic strategies (or that strategies possessed "la tently" were not sufficiently cultivated). A "lack" becomes intelligible on the same level as "presence"; namely, children by middle childhood are beginning to be able to make socially sophisticated decisions beyond adult imposed norms (Thompson et al, 1995, p. 100) among which are deci sions about the kinds of practices worth in vesting an interest in. On this view draw ing exists as just one of many possible practical investments, all subject to the same, unremarkable, social conditions. The "U curve" argument connects with older propositions although it is the ground and the catalyst for the current context of theorizing artistic development. Its logic re states various arbitrary connections of children's graphic products and adult ar tistic/aesthetic virtues of the kind attributed to Cizek and Klee as well as sharing con ceptual ground with the aesthetic and phy logenetic speculations of Topffer (1907), Spencer (1882) and Sully (1896). It offers an inheritance of nominalism important to the current state of the context; albeit an inheritance which diligently avoided its potential for taking human intentions to be central in understanding the intraspecific similarities and differences within the kind and, thus, of the possibility to see the sta tus of drawings as properly "artifact" or at least "not - natural" kinds from which draw ing might be apprehended as a specifically "human" (Hacking, 1992) kind of concept. The Natural/Social Answer to the Drawing/Drawings Question The notion that early childhood graphic behavior must be construed innately be cause patterns of change are readily pre sented in data (which is so readily pre sented for researching) is the persistent problem faced by researchers attempting to theorize from drawings to drawing in a manner removed from nomological pre mises. Their problem lies in explaining how an entity can turn from a "natural kind" into "not a natural kind" seemingly by itself. The simplest response is to state an innate first cause alongside the recognition of social and cultural forces as unproblematically juxtaposed assumptions which need no explanation (e. g., Pariser, 1995, 1997). Kindler and Darras (1994, 1995, 1997; Kindler, 1995) are content to employ the Vygotskian model of development while building their account. However, once their pathway of drawing theory is constructed and they are ready, as Ryle (1951) puts it, for some "theoretical sauntering" on it, Vygotsky is left out and they simply ascribe two varieties of teleological notions to ac count for the contradiction (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1998, p. 151). The unattributed notion of "teleonomic" is employed to cover the explicitly biological claim for early child hood graphic patterns; on Mayr's (1974) construal the term refers to the distinction between processes which achieve an end state passively as the outcome of external conditions (teleomatic) and end-directed processes which achieve that end via an internally coded program. Thus, children are, initially, internally programmed to achieve an end state of pic torial representation; drawing/representa Drawing as Development 65</page><page sequence="7">tion is innate or natural kind. As soon as choice is apparent in the residues of draw ing the "intentional view" of goal directed processes, which is ostensibly a species of causal explanation (Nagel, 1979, p. 278), is assumed; drawing/representation is not a natural kind but a socio/cultural construc tion, a human artifact kind, or a purely nomi nal kind. Again, no explanation is given of how such a change occurs but the logic of the terms used suggests that an innate pro cess achieves its end in causing children to want to represent graphically in differ ent ways which are caused by social and cultural forces. Or, more simply, children are biologically programmed to a naturally existing intention to pursue graphic inter ests which exist culturally and socially. The way out of the logical impasse this constitutes is to insist that social and cul tural forces are themselves explicable via the "teleological repertoire guiding human pictorial behavior" (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1998, p. 149); there must exist some general end state for human pictorial behavior (tran scending social and cultural interests) which provides the "real" cause of all rep resentation. Again, this is akin to the Kantian "noumenon"; the unknowable, transcendental, reality generating the phe nomena of drawing. As with the advance ment of the "U-curve", if such a state did not exist the accrual by some children of various graphic skills would make no sense as a generic kind of development at all. The Cartography of Representation: A Guide into the Unknowable The notion that such development can be "mapped" (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1997) at tempts to provide the kind of knowing about it which Gardner (1980) considered pos sible: One cannot write an equation for turning the non-representational child drawer into one capable of representational depiction and then execute the relevant study. . . . What we can anticipate?and what we may forever have to be satisfied with?is an increasingly accurate description of what happens, a slow motion cinematic portrait of the progress of one child, two children, many children, as they follow the arduous but pleasure tinged path from sheer random motor activity to patent rep resentational form_We can expect in creasingly fine descriptions and increas ingly greater awareness of the environ mental factors that contribute to its course, but we will not be able to find a final?or even a first?cause for what is intrinsic to the processes of development (pp. 36-37). Maps are useful for accurate descrip tion of progress in following arduous paths and for increasing our awareness of envi ronmental factors that contribute to the courses taken. They are the analogy of journeys taken and of journeys which are not simply possible but likely to be taken. However, the usefulness of the analogy diminishes dramatically in implying the ex istence of definable starting points and destinations for drawing activity. Any point in any child's graphic activity can be positioned on a logically definable graphic route, an end for which can be pro jected even if the actual end cannot, reli ably, be predicted. Ends can be projected from chosen graphic strategies simply in recognizing the kind of graphic represen tation they seem to be appropriate to. How ever, as suggested earlier, this simply as sumes that the projected end constitutes a "real" goal which not only causes the child to choose that strategic trajectory but also generates the necessary and sufficient conditions for the child to "develop" towards it. Implicit to the extraordinary inductive ability this ascribes to children is the con comitant ascription of a self-contained, self perpetuating and generative kind of exist ence to identifiable kinds of graphic repre sentation. In other words, accepting the in ductive logic of mapped graphic routes from arbitrary instances of graphic prac tice demands either that children possess, a priori, knowledge of the internal logic of given symbolic systems as well as the ex ternal, practical, logic for their involvement with them, or that such systems autono mously generate and transmit that knowl 66 Philip William Pearson</page><page sequence="8">edge to the children employing them. Nei ther is ontologically or epistemologically tenable. In any case, the starting points (the "final cause") of each journey present suf ficient difficulties to lend doubt to this kind of inductive reasoning. To ascertain multiple beginnings (or causes) of multiple journeys necessitates moving the model quite beyond the scope of developmental concepts stemming from nomological premises into an entirely socio/cultural form of inquiry. Unless, that is, each discrete "kind" of graphic repre sentation is to be held to demand a dis crete natural kind cause (e. g., Pariser, 1997b). However, the latter would also necessitate the untenable defense of a specific innate explanation of any future changes to graphic conventions employed in mapmaking, comic production, topo graphic design or architectural drafting. Even less tenable, but no less imperative, is the need to explain as natural kinds modes of graphic representation within the fine arts constituted through technology such as the photocopier and computer soft ware. Kindler and Darras's (1998) "map" avoids such difficulties in construing mul tiple graphic routes to begin at a common, constant (albeit transcendent or latent), starting point, a ghostly graphic travel cen ter constituted by "gestures born out of the interaction of the sensori-motor activities and the activity of the central nervous sys tem that originate the teleology of represen tation" (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1998, p. 166). From this children secure passage for sub sequent travel towards any number of logi cally definable destinations constituting the possible (existing) states of "being" artisti cally developed in adult social life. Which is to say that the final cause induced for draw ing is a primal necessity for gesturing. Wolf and Perry (1988) also found their account on the existence of discrete sys tems of representation and implicitly draw on the same "intentional" teleological view to explain the involvement of children with them. Both accounts differ markedly from the immediately previous generation of no mological work but neither offer a new po sition for understanding drawing. This is returned to the argument advanced by Froebel in 1826 (1887); artistic (drawing) activity is innate to children having the pur pose of developing representation. The contribution of such work to educa tion is to assert that it provides a step to wards a postmodern pedagogy (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1998) on the grounds that their model of drawing development lays bare "the universe of imagery" (p. 160). The lat ter belief is probably reasonable but the model does not lay bare the universe of children's drawing. It simply stipulates what should be significant in that universe and, as such, offers little more than previous art educational propositions founded on the belief that children's drawing is a natural kind entity. At best, it shows that training children in the use of a single graphic sys tem (such as lineal perspective) is insuffi cient to provide them with knowledge of the existing range of graphic representation in social life. The point is helpful but already well established from ideographic work. At worst, it implies that children should be ex posed to that range (including forms which cannot be located in adult graphic practices) because it constitutes the true requirement of representational/artistic development, the achievement of which is prevented by chil dren themselves in the "early selection of a narrow path" (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1998, p. 166) of graphic interests. In other words, "the great teloi" (p. 149) of pictorial imagery presents an educational need and, thus, the rationale to override the actual interests children develop through their chosen involvements with drawing, a need which is especially great for children who choose to develop no such interest. This impulse connects with a further Froebelian notion, of the need to develop as a "whole person". The choice not to be involved in drawing activity diminishes the possibility of representational wholeness impacting upon the "exciting possibility" of whatever a representational^ whole hu manity might prove to be. "Cognitive defi cits" might be deposed as the psychologi Drawing as Development 67</page><page sequence="9">cal consequence of graphic disinterest (Kindler, 1993) but in its place stands a semiotic deficit. As an art education this cultural consequence lies close to the syn thesis of the natural and cultural advanced by McFee and Degge (1980) where visual thinking (drawing) is a necessary condition for "whole" thinking ability in children but children will vary in graphic requirements for developing that ability because of the diverse environments (cultures) within which children experience life as the con texts of learning shaping distinctive percep tual and conceptual thinking. Drawing as Representation as a Developmental Process Ives and Gardner (1984) offered a puzzle as to whether "individual predispositions, genetic potentials, and cultural influences should interact in ways which can in prin ciple be specified" (p. 28). The specifica tion offered by Kindler and Darras does not solve the puzzle but as an attempt to move beyond the constraints of "stage" theories in order to grasp the actual and complex relationships constituting the graphic prac tices conducted by children it has, perhaps, pushed closer to another kind of question. The difficulties pointed to above result from misconstruing the task of making such prac tice intelligible as an "attempt to conceptu alize the development of pictorial represen tation" (Kindler &amp; Darras, 1997, p. 19). Any account of the entity of drawing predicated on the existence of such a thing as artistic development will fail because the latter cannot be shown to exist in any way consistent with the logic of its use. More over, reducing what can be grasped of drawing to the possibilities of "pictorial rep resentation" is a direct consequence of believing drawings to be the principle data from which to establish the "final cause" of drawing (Pearson, 1999). Drawing is not the object of interest in all this. Rather the object is representation as an entity in it self. Drawings constitute representations, signs. To describe "what happens" when children "move from sheer random motor activity to patent representational fo'm" is to describe what happens to the represen tations, the signs. What counts in that de scription is consistent with what counts in debate about the nature of representation in general social life (Schwartz, 1984) but specifically in that part of life to do with art (e. g., Goodman, 1969, 1988; Margolis, 1987). The circularity of theorizing drawing as, on the one hand, representation and, on the other, as development, is present throughout the context. Its source can be located in the founding of Project Zero at Harvard with the amalgam of Goodman's interest in symbolic forms and their uses (an interest drawing on Peirce's semiotics) and Gardner's concern with cognitivist revolutionaries such as Chomsky in linguis tics and his self-professed "crossing" of Goodman with Piaget (Gardner, 1992). Al most all the work of the context still rests on this convergence of the late 1960's but the same concerns took form on the oppo site side of the Atlantic in the mid 1970's and it is worth noting the different trajecto ries of what are, ostensibly, consistent projects to see the effects of developmen tal logic on the theorizing of drawing. Drawing as Representation Without Development Norman Freeman (1997) makes a genu inely radical statement within the context with his "consideration of the peculiar na ture of drawing as a domain of specifically social competence" (p. 31). The ambiva lence of primary (natural) and secondary (socio/cultural) explanation is no less evi dent in this work but its character lies in representation and not development. Freeman is concerned with represen tational performances (e. g., Freeman, 1980) and with what children require in or der to conduct such performances, as in possessing specific cognitive resources like theories (Freeman, 1991) enabling specific kinds of graphic performance. All this work is situated within normative no tions of development in children but has 68 Philip William Pearson</page><page sequence="10">never rested on drawing as a kind of de velopment; drawing is a kind of perfor mance requiring explanation. Furthermore, drawing performances are not explicable through analogy with language (Freeman, 1972). They are distinct as a kind of prac tice in which issues of human perception are integrated with human graphic conven tions (p. 125). The specifically social domain of com petence explains the unpredictable and even volatile character of children's graphic practices as well as those trajectories of performances which seem so thoroughly patterned and coherent as to be, surely, directed towards an intended end goal. Performance diversity corresponds to the utilization of those early established rep resentational resources; the more use they get the more likely it is that children will build more substantial representational repertoires and with such resources the means and reasons to engage in further drawing practice. In short, practice in rep resenting begets the conditions for more practice. Without the concept of develop ment presenting the central structure for theorizing, Freeman comes close to appre hending drawing as a kind of practice rather than as a kind of cognition. The step is not taken because the existence of drawing remains underpinned by the explanation of another entity, that of representation. As with Kindler and Darras, represen tation is the beginning premise for Free man. It is the key to internal resources which are assumed to enable enculturation into graphic performance. The evidence for the existence of inter nal resources comes down to the proposi tion that : we are born with a propensity to interest ourselves in the appearance of other members of our own species and to at tend to and attempt to emulate the actions of others. Some of the brain mechanisms that serve those functions are in active op eration within minutes of birth, others take some weeks to be activated_That fas cination with the human figure does not diminish in early childhood and comes to pervade all domains of symbolic explora tion. The child's visual system has evolved to be precociously sensitive to visual pat terns that match aspects of the human fig ure, and the primary representations of the patterns serve as an apparently inexhaust ible resource for subsequent symbolic activities, (p. 25) The general cognitive operation of hu man figure processing provides the final cause of drawing and the means to grasp how a natural kind of existence turns into a nominal kind of existence. A cognitive representation of the human figure is the necessary and sufficient antecedent con dition for the existence of all representa tion. And only socio/cultural factors prevent it pervading a universal human existence; cultural practices can intervene to inhibit symbolic expression, by legislating against anthropomorphic iconography on religious grounds or by reserving such depiction for adults in the less accessible reaches of caves. But the resource is not thereby ab lated_It is not too difficult to enrich the bare account of why we have a head start if we come to practice our graphic gifts in contexts where humanity is topicalized. (pp. 25-26) This is a properly causal statement. It does not depend on the existence of a priori knowledge in children for inducing the sym bolic realm of human existence. A practi cal, manifest, human relation presents the very possibility of conditions from which any kind of representation might spring. The pragmatic simplicity of the explanation is attractive but, as with the rest of the con text, it remains unable to explain why chil dren are involved in graphic practices and why children are not. Children who do inhabit "contexts where humanity is topicalized" often do not prac tice their "graphic gifts". Freeman is at pains to recognize the practical significance of a simple lack of graphic "know how" (through lack of practice) and the more complex (but ordinary) decision to refuse to perform graphically when researchers might require them to. Such recognition is sensible when drawing is a specifically Drawing as Development 69</page><page sequence="11">social domain of competence but not if drawing is caused by the generic existence of a cognitive representational resource. Ultimately a lack of graphic performance must have a cause consistent with its pres ence, the deeper cognitive failure to pos sess a representational sense of human beings. Either representation as an innate/ predisposed mental structure is the cause of drawing or drawing is a domain of spe cifically social competence. Drawing can not make sense as both. The virtue of Freeman's position is that it is relatively straightforward to ignore the implications of a representational final cause and instead focus upon the insights into graphic resources to elucidate the spe cifically social domain of competence. When that cause is merged in the logic of development any explanatory power on offer is inescapably infused in teleological reasoning. Conclusion Speaking of drawing as "artistic develop ment" (in any manner beyond the sense of learning involved in acquiring specific graphic skills) implicitly assumes that draw ing exists in the being of children in the same sense that they can "be" eleven years old. This brings teleological reasoning into the business of explaining and understand ing drawing since the apprehension of any instance of the latter is to apprehend a point in a process directed toward the goal of artistic "maturity" just as apprehending an instance of being eleven is to apprehend a point in the process of growth directed at the goal of physical "maturity". Again, for the idea of artistic develop ment to make sense we must have some notion of what it is to be artistically devel oped. This is presented to theorists by adults who play the role of adult "artist", a conventionally accepted and apprehended milieu of practices. What distinguishes ideas of artistic development characterized by Eisner and Project Zero from those of Kindler and Darras, and Wolf and Perry, lies in the recognition of one legitimate milieu of practices constituting the mature artistic role relative to diverse milieus of practices constituting equally legitimate mature roles. Gardner (1993) construes a variety of roles to accord with specific sym bolic systems which "may have evolved just in those cases where there exists a com putational capacity ripe for harvesting by the culture" (p. 66). These are "end points" for developing the autonomous kind of in telligence he calls "spatial" which fulfills the same explanatory need as the "teleology of pictorial representation". Likewise, recognizing one "goal" or many has the same theoretical function. Putting ends on artistic developmental models greatly simplifies theorizing to re lating changes in individual graphic produc tion (and differences found between indi viduals) to the purposes which must surely lie at the bottom of what children do, to be found within the milieu of adult artistic prac tices. There is nothing at all radical in this claim. James Sully (1896) stated that the task of theory was to do just that; we must try to understand what process a child's mind goes through when he draws something, and to compare this with what passes in the mind of an adult artist, (p. 385) Social and cultural factors are important within contemporary developmental schemes because they help to account for the manifest lack of fully artistically devel oped adults. They explain the unreliability of graphic trajectories which constitute the sole evidence of any process to make ar tistic development with, not only of graphic "strategies" themselves but also of the con tinuity with which they are pursued. Through a period in which even art educa tion theory has come to recognize the un tenable connections between overt naturist beliefs with socio/cultural effects of racism, sexism and classism, those very socio/cul tural forces are drawn into a theory vacuum to re-explain the failures of a developmen tal process evident in the many children who "lose" the will and means to pursue any trajectory at all. 70 Philip William Pearson</page><page sequence="12">The latter is the most serious implica tion of adopting developmental schemes. The only way to make sense of children who make drawings and of children who do not is to construe the former as a nor mative human state and the latter as some form of deviance from that state, as a loss". Again, it does not matter that deviance is explained as a biological concern or socio/ culturally. Schemes of "artistic develop ment" produce categories of more or less successful human existence because the logic of constructing this kind of theory al lows no other end. When such categories are embodied in art educations they are no longer theoreti cal artifacts generated out of a specific realm of discourse. They become genera tive. That is, they generate the conditions in which definitions of existence are prac ticed on children. When they are given mobilizing force on the practical lives of children they enable the manufacture of the very divisions in children's being the cat egories presume to exist, a priori. The potential for theory to bring about the practical existence of its abstracted components is described as the "theory ef fect", an effect capable of "imposing a vi sion of divisions" (Bourdieu, 1990b, p. 129) upon people. One theory effect of "artistic development" can be found in the oft quoted plea (typically claimed as support for the validity of the notion) "I can not draw so I am no good at art," the assumption being that the necessary precondition of "artistic" practice is competence in some, specific kind of graphic practice. Given the long standing predominance of drawing in (or as) art educations from the advent of mass education it might be said that the connection of drawing skill and artistic prac tice is "a well-founded historical artifact" (p. 129). Certainly, it is an artifact which im bues thinking about what causes people to be successful in their art educations (e. g., Clark, 1993; Getzels &amp; Csikzentmihalyi, 1976; Wilson &amp; Wilson, 1982; Wilson, Hurwitz, &amp; Wilson, 1987). Adults can, and do, become involved in adult artistic practices without any neces sary connection with the graphic practices which children engage in as "artistic de velopment". In other words, there is sim ply no necessary connection between be ing in the end state of "artistic development" and being involved in processes catego rized as "developing artistically". Moreover, there is little evidence, when we look to see, of the kind of progress in graphic perfor mance which might reasonably be ex pected of adults (who do not play the role of adult artist) if such performance existed in the normative sense of human develop ment (Golomb, 1993; H?gen, 1985). The theorized relationship of "artistic development" with "artistically developed" is an arbitrary connection. Likewise, artis tic development is a fiction of the same order as the category of "natural develop ment" (Gardner, 1991). Drawn out of the alchemy attempted over one hundred and fifty years to turn a human practice into a human biology, it is a fiction which has, it self, been polished into a "well founded historical artifact".
