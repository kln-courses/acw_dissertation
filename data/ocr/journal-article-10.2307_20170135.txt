<plain_text><page sequence="1">8 Advances in Archaeological Seriation WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT Seriation is a deceptively simple technique, the unnecessarily abstruse discussion of which has become an embarrassment to quantitative ar chaeologists. At the same time, seriation is a mathematically entertaining and eminently useful procedure, the epistemological status of which has been insufficiently explored by archaeologists. If the reader is already confused, let me hasten to add that one purpose of this chapter is to introduce seriation painlessly to the serious student. Also, some profes sional archaeologists may be under the mistaken impression that the seriation activity has been taken over by robots and no longer requires good judgment, careful field work, and plain common sense. Nothing could be further from the truth. An interesting series of mathematically oriented papers on seriation has appeared in the past few years, however, so a second purpose of this chapter is to summarize recent thought on seriation, relating new approaches to the research problems faced today by practicing professionals. I shall not provide a history of seriation, but the interested reader is directed to informative papers on this subject by Johnson (1972:315-318), Kendall (1963), Rouse (1967:154-155), and Rowe (1962). Mathematical terminology will be kept to a minimum in discussion but the reader is asked to make the effort necessary to master the small number of essential concepts introduced.

MARQUARDT will (a) explain how seriation works, (b) discuss advances in seriation techniques, theory, and epistemology, and (c) place seriation within the context of contemporary archaeological research. Seriation is a descriptive analytic technique, the purpose of which is to arrange comparable units in a single dimension (that is, along a line) such that the position of each unit reflects its similarity to other units. Thus, in Figure 8.1, if units A, B, C, and D are correctly seriated, then A is more like B than it is like C; A is more dissimilar to D than B is dissimilar to D; and so on. As in all seriations, there are two possible "correct" solutions to the problem in Figure 8.1: either A?B?C?D or D?C?B?A. Dif ferent methods, including scaling procedures, have been used to effect the ordering. True scaling techniques involve the assignment of numerical values indicating the relative closeness of each unit to all other units. The word seriation does not itself imply a scaling technique, but merely the ranking of units and their subsequent linear ordering on the basis of these ranks. Although seriation is frequently used by archaeologists as a dating technique, it can be presumed to be such only if the ordering criteria are reliable chronological indicators. In order to seriate, one needs to decide (a) the dimension along which units are to be arranged, and (b) some unambiguous way to rank units so that they can be ordered along that dimension. If units A, B, C, and D in the above example are persons of ages 5, 20, 30, and 50, respectively, and the dimension of interest is "age," then the four individuals are properly seriated on the basis of chronological age. If the same persons A, B, C, and D are 100 cm, 160 cm, 190 cm, and 170 cm tall, respectively, and the dimension of interest is "tallness," then the four individuals would be seriated differently on the basis of height measurements (Figure 8.2). The examples in Figures 8.1 and 8.2 are trivial, of course, because the ages and heights are already known, and the ordering on these dimensions is clear. A matrix is any rectangular arrangement of numbers; the horizontal lines of numbers are called rows, and the vertical lines of numbers are called columns. All seriation techniques begin with adata matrix, with the units to be ordered being listed horizontally as rows, the variables mea sured on each unit being listed vertically as columns. Each number in a matrix is called an element. In the example in Figure 8.2, the matrix has four rows and only one column (Table 8.1). (A matrix with only one row or only one column is called a vector.)

The outcome of a seriation depends on the dimension along which units are ordered. Seriation is most familiar to archaeologists as a relative dating tech nique, where the dimension of interest is time. Thus, archaeologists must discover some unambiguous way to measure units (for example, graves, excavation units, surface collections) so that they can be inferred to be ordered along the dimension time. The kinds of measurements or observa tions made depend on the nature of the units being seriated; thus, ar chaeologists have made use of several kinds of data matrices. One important kind of data matrix is the incidence matrix, a matrix in which only the presence or absence of a certain criterion is indicated in the appropriate column for each of the units (rows). Usually a "1" denotes presence of the criterion, "0" its absence. We do this kind of seriation informally when we observe old buildings and attempt to guess their ages on the basis of the presence or absence of certain architectural features. For an illustration of an incidence data matrix, consider the example shown in Table 8.2. Here the seven units are gasoline-powered automobiles, and five possible observations are listed across the top. It will occur to the reader that dozens of unambiguous observations could be made on an object as complicated as an automobile. Some of the observa tions noted here are more useful indicators of temporal change than others. For example, although radios were installed in automobiles as early as the 1920s, they are commonly considered optional equipment even today. Automatic transmission was perfected a generation ago, but it is still rare in certain classes of automobiles, such as sports cars. When car No. 6 was manufactured in 1965, an automatic transmission was not an option available in the Volkswagen Beetle, nor was an automatic transmission a feature of car No. 7, a 1974 sports car. Finally, we can note that car No. 7 has spoked wheels, but this is for a stylistic reason rather TABLE 8.1 Data Matrix Consisting of Four Units (Persons) and Only One Variable (Height)0 Height Unit (cm) A 100 B 160 C 190 D 170 "A correct seriation of these data on the dimension "tallness" is shown in Figure 8.2 (this page).</page><page sequence="4">260 WILLIAM H.

A "perfect" seriation would place unit 7 between units 3 and 4. This error results from a poor choice of observations. than a functional reason. Clearly, inferential errors can result from carelessly chosen categories. A frequent archaeological use of incidence data for seriation is for the relative temporal placement of certain graves. In such cases we assume that the graves represent burials of a single cultural group, having reason ably consistent norms characterizing the cultural practice of human interment, that items found in a grave were in use at the time of the burial, and that each kind of item (artifact type) was in general use in only one discrete time interval. The ''best" seriation, based on these assumptions, is one that most closely brings the l's together in one group in each column. Another important kind of data matrix is the abundance matrix, a matrix in which the elements are numerical indicators of the abundance of some particular characteristic, relative to some absolute minimum. Abundance matrices may be further subdivided into two types. In the first, the elements of the matrix represent percentages or relative pro portions of certain characteristics of each unit being seriated. For any single row (unit) the percentages must add to 100% (or, if the elements represent relative proportions, the relative proportions must sum to 1.0). Table 8.3 is an example of an abundance matrix composed of percentages. This is the same kind of matrix that characterized the approach to seria tion of ceramic surface collections popularized by Ford and his colleagues (Phillips et al. 1951). As Ford describes it, the pottery is first classified into types, and, for each unit to be seriated, percentages of each type are</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 261 TABLE 8.3 Hypothetical Abundance of Different Types of Methods of Artificial Illumination in the State of Pennsylvania, 1850-1950?

These data, invented by Mayer-Oakes (1955:176-178) after consulting electrical engineers and published sources (Watkins 1952), provide an example of an abundance matrix with familiar type categories. calculated. These percentages are then represented as horizontal bars on long narrow strips of graph paper. The strips are "arranged and rear ranged in relation to one another until the clearest patterning appears" (Ford 1962:42) (see Figure 8.3). The assumptions underlying seriation by percentage matrix are (a) that each artifact type has an incipience, a florescence, and a decline; (b) that each unit constitutes a more or less representative sample of the artifact types in use; and (c) that the units to be seriated represent short ranges of time and come from a limited geographic area. The appropriateness of seriation by percentage matrix and the validity of the presuppositions underlying the practice will be discussed later. In the second kind of abundance matrix the elements are logically independent ratio-scale variables calculated for each unit. Independent ratio-scale variables are not required to sum to 1 or to 100% for each unit. Unlike percentages (Speth and Johnson 1976:48-49), ratio-scale variables are amenable to analysis by pattern-sensitive similarity coefficients, such as Pearson's r. The variables are chosen in such a way that they either generally increase or generally decrease with the passage of time. Such variables also have the advantage of flexibility, because one can construct them at several levels of analysis: assemblage, type, mode, etc. To use an example similar to the one used above, suppose we wish to seriate chronologically a group of automobiles. Appropriate ratio-scale variables might be a measurement of the area devoted to window glass</page><page sequence="6">WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT Figure 8.3 Ford's graphical seriation technique. (From Ford 1962, Fig. 8.) divided by the total surface area, the volume available for the storage of luggage divided by a linear measurement of the wheelbase, or the total weight of various plastic materials used divided by the total weight of the car. All these variables might be expected generally to increase with the passage of time. A detailed example of the use of ratio-scale variables in archaeological seriation is given elsewhere (Marquardt 1974b:64-121, 144-173). Although there is much room for thoughtful discussion of the cultural assumptions underlying the practice of seriation, and a real need to resolve, in every case, a wide range of practical problems in order to assure comparability between meaningful units, it should be clear by now that seriation is mathematically rather simple. The mathematical problem consists in finding, for a given data matrix, the arrangement of rows (units) that best satisfies the following criterion: In each individual column the elements either (a) increase to a maximum and then decrease, or (b) increase, or (c) decrease. This requirement is interpreted in the "weak" sense; that is, two or more consecutive identical elements in a single</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 263 column do not constitute a violation of the requirement. (A series of numbers that increases, or decreases, in this "weak" sense is said to be increasing, or decreasing, monotonically.) An abundance matrix that per fectly satisfies the requirement is sometimes called a Q-matrix (Kendall 1971b:219). Laxton (1976) has proposed a measure of the extent to which an abundance matrix fails to satisfy the properties of a Q-matrix; see also Wilkinson (1971:282). The mathematical problem is the same, whether the data matrix be composed of percentage, ratio, ratio-scale variable, or the presence/ absence of elements. In this regard we may consider the incidence matrix a special case of the abundance matrix. The mathematical problem in the case of incidence data reduces to the task of permuting (rearranging) the rows until the l's are brought together in one group in each column, to the extent that this is possible. An incidence matrix that perfectly satisfies the requirement is sometimes called a P-matrix (Kendall 1971b:220). The ordering of units may be carried out by rearranging the n rows (units), as shown in Figure 8.3. Commonly, however, the ordering is done by rearranging the n row-columns of an n x n matrix of between-unit similarity coefficients until high values cluster about the principal diagonal, a procedure advocated by Robinson (1951). In other words, we do not work directly with the n x m data matrix, but with an n x n matrix derived from the data matrix. A simple example will show that these procedures are equivalent for ideal data. Suppose that we have systematically collected samples of pottery from the surfaces of five archaeological sites and that, for purposes of this example, the pottery sorts neatly into four types, termed Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4 (Table 8.4). There are five units (rows), so there are 5! (5!=lx2x3x4x5= 120) possible arrangements. Instead of rearranging the rows, as in Ford's (1962) procedure, let us generate a matrix of similarity coefficients for all pairs of sites. There are many ways of expressing numerically the similarity between units. Here, we follow TABLE 8.4 Unseriated Artificial Data Matrix Consisting of Percentages of Four Pottery Types Found on the Surfaces of Five Sites Unit Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 Type 4 Total Site A 0% 20% 10% 70% 100% Site B 0 40 5 55 100 Site C 50 0 0 50 100 Site D 10 10 10 70 100 Site E 20 0 5 75 100</page><page sequence="8">264 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT Robinson's (1951) classic treatment, calculating an index of agreement (IA) for each pair of units: IAjk = 200 m (i Xji xk meaning that the index of agreement between unit./ and unit k is found by subtracting from 200 the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the percentages registered for each type. The figure 200 is used because 200% is the maximum possible disagreement. In this case m = 4 in the formula because there are four types represented. Figure 8.4 pro vides a computational example, and Table 8.5 represents the n x n similarity matrix obtained in this manner. Robinson's I A coefficient is based on the assumption that similar units will have similar percentages of the various artifact types. It should be clear from the example of Figure 8.4 that the value of I A will decrease as the differences between units increase. Table 8.5 is an n x n symmetric matrix. In any symmetric matrix, the element in the /th row and the Jth column is identical to the element in thejth row and the ith column. The principal diagonal of a square symmetric matrix S is composed of the elements s n, s22, , snw, where st? means the element of S that is located at the intersection of the ith row and thejth column, and n is the number of row-columns. The similarity coefficient of a particular unit with itself will always represent the maximum possible similarity, and in the case of Robinson's /A, we observe that the principal diagonal contains the value 200, because the sum of the differences of percentages for one row with IAAB = 200 - ( ? | XAi - XBi \) = 200 - (0=+ 20 + 5 + 15) = 200 - 40 = 160 IAAC = 200 - ? ]? | XAi - Xci = 200 - (50 V 20 + 10 + 20) 200 - 100 = 100 7AAD = 200-?? \XAi-Xm \\ = 200 - (10 + 10 + 0 + 0) 200 - 20 = etc. 180 Figure 8.4.

Because it is a symmetric matrix, the elements on one side of the principal diagonal are a mirror image of those on the other side of the principal diagonal. We can now rearrange the row-columns so that the higher values will be clustered about the principal diagonal, with decreasing values as "one goes away from the diagonal either vertically or horizontally" (Robinson 1951:295). This results in Table 8.6. Notice that the correct seriated order is c?E?D?A?B (or B?A?D?E?C). Rearranging the rows of the original data matrix (see Table 8.7) confirms that the result is the same: The columns of the permuted data matrix satisfy the "increase-or decrease-or-increase-and-then-decrease ' ' criterion. In practice, of course, archaeological data are rarely well-behaved enough to enable such a straightforward rearrangement. In his original article, Robinson (1951:298-301) recommended certain heuristic proce dures to help guide the rearrangement process and to evaluate progress in achieving the best ordering. It should also be noted that it is possible, in nonideal cases, for a similarity matrix to be in Robinson form without the corresponding data matrix being a perfect P-matrix (or Q-matrix). Difficulties inherent in Ford's row rearrangement technique and in Robinson's similarity matrix manipulation technique will be discussed more thoroughly below.

To summarize, seriation is a unidimensional ordering technique used to arrange items in a series such that the position of an item, relative to other items, reflects its similarity to those other items. Although it need not necessarily be a chronological ordering technique, archaeologists have made frequent use of seriation to arrange units along a temporal dimen sion. Seriation may be carried out on incidence (presence/absence) data or on abundance data. In the latter case the data are often expressed as relative frequencies or as percentages of certain artifact types found in the units to be seriated. Less frequently, ratio-scale variables have been used in place of percentages or relative frequencies. Seriation can be carried out either by directly rearranging the rows (units) of a data matrix or by manipulating a similarity matrix derived therefrom. ADVANCES IN SERIATION TECHNIQUES The works of Ford (1962), discussed above, provide an appropriate place to begin a discussion of advances in thinking about the question of seriation. Ford's graphical technique has the advantage of simplicity, and, for a relatively small number of units, it is efficient. Over 15 years after its publication, Ford's A Quantitative Method for Deriving Cultural Chronology (1962) still contains good advice for the archaeologist begin ning to explore unknown or poorly known regions. Ford's technique consists in representing the percentage of each pottery type found in a given unit as a bar of corresponding width on a long strip of graph paper, then arranging and rearranging the strips until the 'increase, decrease, or increase and then decrease" pattern emerges in the columns. Naturally, an increase in the percentage of one type must result in the decrease in the</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 267 percentage of one or more of the other types. To see that this might conceivably be disadvantageous, consider a situation in which a plain pottery consistently employed in association with culinary activities and a decorated ware used only in ceremonies are manufactured. Now suppose that at a later time the production of decorated ceramics is increased, but production of the plain ceramics remains constant. A representative sam ple of pottery from the later time period would show a higher proportion of decorated pottery. Because the total must sum to 100%, the plain pottery will appear to have decreased in "popularity," when in fact its rate of production remained exactly the same. If we are interested only in a relative chronology, however, this feature of the technique will concern us less than if we are attempting to reconstruct the actual patterns of ceramic change. (This question will be more thoroughly discussed below.) Perhaps a more serious criticism of the technique is that it leaves too much room for subjective judgment about the "best" sequence; it is often difficult for competent workers to agree on such matters. [R?gnier (1977) has proposed a computerized algorithm closely following Ford's tech nique of using the combined information provided by several test excava tions.] McNutt (1973) has pointed out that the choice of different typolog ical subdivisions can lead to erroneous sequences even when the data appear to satisfy the assumptions on which the technique is based. In a paper published in 1959, Meighan proposed a fast graphical seria tion technique that involves combining similar types until there are only three major types, then calculating percentages as if there exist only three types in the material. Plotting of the resulting data on triangular graph paper produces a cluster of points along an axis. A straight line is then drawn such that an equal number of points fall on either side of the line, and perpendiculars are drawn from the points to the line to establish the sequence. Because the three types, say A, B, and C, in the Meighan procedure sum to 100% of the assemblage, one of the variables can be expressed in terms of the other two (for example, %C = 100% - %A - %B); thus, the graphing of only two of the three types on ordinary two-dimensional graph paper is sufficient (Ascher 1959). Like Ford's graphical technique, Meighan's procedure is fast and sim ple. The latter is useful as a preliminary ordering technique, when time is limited, provided the three types used are reasonably good chronological indicators. Hole and Shaw (1967:76) found that both bad and good data could result in curved plots on triangular graph paper, a situation that always obtains when all three of the types are changing through time (Meighan 1959:204). As noted above, the Robinson technique proceeds from a square sym metric matrix of similarity coefficients derived from the original data</page><page sequence="12">268 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT matrix, instead of beginning with the latter and permuting the rows. Robinson's technique was tested on deposits of known chronological order by Brainerd (1951), and used successfully by Belous (1953), Dixon (1956), Flanders (1960), and others. The manipulation of the Robinson agreement matrix is time-consuming and tedious for large numbers of units, however. The procedure is also vulnerable to the same criticism often leveled at Ford's graphical technique: Manual rearrangement of the deposits is unsystematic, and hence prone to unconscious subjectivity. Dempsey and Baumhoff (1963) became concerned that the Robinson approach of differentially weighting types on the basis of their relative frequencies could introduce error in cases where the incipience, flores cence, and extinction of a particular type occurred completely within the time range of concern. They recommended a presence/absence rather than a relative frequency approach, cautioning that built-in similarity between units should be avoided by defining classifications "so that the presence (or absence) of any one type contains no necessary inplication concerning the presence (or absence) of any other type" in the same unit (Dempsey and Baumhoff 1963:499). Their procedure begins with a similar ity matrix in which the elements record the number of times a given artifact type is present in both units or absent in both units. Next, the units are split into two groups?presumably "early" and "late"?by comparing, in turn, the similarity coefficient between each unit and the unit having the greatest range of similarity values. One group contains the half of the units with the lowest coefficients of similarity to the chosen unit; the other half contains those with the highest coefficients. Then, the average agreement of each unit with each of the two groups of units is found, and the units are reordered with respect to the signed differences between the average with Group 1 and the average with Group 2. The average reordering procedure is repeated until no better ordering is possible. In a comparison of their orderings of real data previously examined by Belous and Heizer, Dempsey and Baumhoff reported a Spearman rank order correlation of 0.96 with Heizer's results, a 0.77 correlation with those of Belous. The Dempsey-Baumhoff technique, based as it is on presence/absence data, is subject to the same criticism as other methods based on a binary scale: Incidence of one artifact type is counted as heavily as the occurrence of several hundred such items; hence, poten tially interesting information is ignored. Also, as Cowgill (1968b:518), Hole and Shaw (1967:78), Lipe (1964:103-104), and others have pointed out, even the slightest mixing of artifacts from two proveniences may seriously affect the ordering. Cowgill (1968b:518) and Hole and Shaw (1967:78-79) also properly state that Dempsey and Baumhoff are in error when they claim that the Robinson technique is incapable of adequately</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 269 evaluating types that begin, peak, and end within the time range of interest. (In fact, the Robinson model is based on the assumption that a type will peak in popularity only once, and that no type will end abruptly near its peak of popularity.) Finally, Hole and Shaw (1967:77) indicate that the Dempsey-Baumhoff technique is difficult to carry out and is prone to excessive computational errors. Renfrew and Sterud (1969) proposed a diagrammatic technique that also begins with a similarity matrix. Proceeding from the assumption that units closest in time will have the highest similarity coefficients, they arrange the units in a linear order, joined by bonds indicating their relative similar ity. When loops occur, Renfrew and Sterud provide conventions for restoring the linearity, if such an arrangement is possible for the given data. Further, they introduce a simple "cluster coefficient" that can be calculated before beginning the process. The coefficient varies from 0 (perfect linear ordering is possible) to 100 (a linear ordering is impossible), and they find that their technique is generally reliable for cluster coefficients of less than 60. The Renfrew-Sterud hand technique is simple and unambiguous. Two different persons should be able to obtain the same ordering if given the same matrix of similarities. Because computation times increase only arithmetically with the number of units being seriated, they recommend the technique as an appropriate means for the preliminary investigation of the structure of a data set or for ordering a matrix of more than 35 units. The technique considers the relationship between closely similar units only, linking according to the magnitude of the similarity coefficients, but cannot take into account weaker links. If there is one main linear relation ship within the data structure, the Renfrew-Sterud technique is a fast and systematic means for finding the best sequence. Statistician Gelfand (1971a,b) offered a generalization of the Renfrew Sterud double-linkage technique, and has additionally proposed an av eraging procedure that has had good results when applied to archaeologi cal data. These techniques are referred to (by Gelfand) as Method I and Method II, respectively. With Method I, one selects in decreasing order the n - 1 largest similar ity coefficients such that (a) no subscript is included more than twice, and (b) all subscripts "communicate"?that is, do not form closed loops (they do not "cluster," in Renfrew and Sterud's sense of the term). With Gelfand's Method II, one constructs an estimated order for each separate row of the matrix of similarities according to the familiar Robin son pattern of monotonie decrease from the principal diagonal. Then these estimated orders are averaged to give an overall estimated order. It happens that, if there exists a permutation of the matrix that will cast it</page><page sequence="14">270 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT perfectly into the Robinson form, all n estimated orders of Method II will be identical (Gelfand 1971a: 194-195, 1971b:269-271). Gelfand also pre sents a "continuity index" (Gelfand 1971a: 195-196, 1971b:269-271) that enables the comparison of one estimated order with another. Gelfand's Method II, illustrated here in Figure 8.5, is somewhat more reliable than Method I, although both work well for well-behaved data. Neither technique is complicated, and, for small matrices, both are fast, efficient, and unambiguous. The techniques are easily programmed to be carried out by a digital computer. Ascher and Ascher (1963) were the first to construct a completely computerized procedure for ordering a similarity matrix of Robinson index of agreement coefficients. The computerized procedure inserts one row (and column) at a time, testing each new row-column in each position. Those row-columns not fully satisfying the monotonie decrease criterion are held aside until all other row-columns are placed. Goodness of fit to the ideal Robinson matrix (similarities monotonically decrease as one moves away from the principal diagonal) is evaluated in terms of the smallest number of negatively signed differences between scores. Then the residual row-columns are inserted, one at a time, in the best possible relationship to the already-ordered row-columns, with the stipulation that the relative position of the latter stay the same. The Ascher-Ascher program was a step forward at the time of its publication, for it made the sorting of large similarity matrices considera bly easier and somewhat more systematic. However, because each placement of a row-column assumes that the previously positioned row-columns are correctly ordered, and because the ordering always begins with the first row-column and proceeds to the ?th, the initial input sequence influences the final seriation to a considerable degree. With different initial orders, one may find better (or worse) solutions. Kuzara, a computer programmer, devised an improved algorithm for the ordering of similarity matrices into the Robinson form (Kuzara et al. 1966). Kuzara's program works with the entire similarity matrix at once. The first row-column is moved into the second position, and the new ordering and the previous ordering are compared for goodness of fit, the better of the two orderings being held in storage in the computer. The same row-column is tried in position 3, then 4, and so on, until it has been tried in all positions, with only the single "best" ordering being retained in computer memory. Then the second row-column, the third, etc., are tried in all positions in the same way, until every row-column has been tried in every position. The entire process is then restarted and done again and again, until no improvement is apparent in the orderings. Two criteria are used to determine goodness of fit, criterion A being the sum of the magnitudes of the negatively signed differences, criterion B being the</page><page sequence="15">Step 1: Construct an estimated order for the first row, A. Disregarding the principal diagonal, the largest similarity coefficient in row A is that between A and D, so write down A?D Now find the next highest coefficient in row A. It is that between A and B. In order to know whether to link B with the A end of the chain or the D end of the chain, examine the coefficients between B and A and between B and D. 7ABA = 160, and IABD = 140. Because 160 is larger than 140, B is assigned to the A end of the chain, rather than to the D end. The estimated order for row A is, then, B?A?D Now find the next highest coefficient in row A. It is that between A and E. In order to know whether to link E with the B end of the chain or the D end of the chain, examine the coefficients between E and B and between E and D. IAEB = 120, and IAED = 170. Because 170 is larger than 120, E is assigned to the D end of the chain, rather than to the B end. The estimated order for row A is now B?A?D?E Finally, the last remaining coefficient in row A is that between A and C. In order to know whether to link C with the B end of the chain or the E end of the chain, examine the coefficients between C and B and between C and E. IACB = 100, and IACE = 140. Because 140 is larger than 100, C is assigned to the E end of the chain, rather than to the B end. The final estimated order for row A is thus B?A?D?E?C Step 2: Construct an estimated order for the second row, B, in the same manner. Step 3: Construct an estimated order for the third row, C, in the same manner. Step 4: Construct an estimated order for the fourth row, D, in the same manner. Step 5: Construct an estimated order for the last row, E, in the same manner. In this case, the five resulting estimated orders are identical: A: B?A?D?E?C B: B?A?D?E?C C: B?A?D?E?C D: B?A?D?E?C E: B?A?I&gt;-E?C Now calculate the average ranks, Tjtj = 1, 2, ..., n, where n is the number of rows: TA = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2= 10 because A is ranked second 5 times. JB =1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1= 5 because B is ranked first 5 times. Tc = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25 because C is ranked fifth 5 times. TD = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 because D is ranked third 5 times. TE = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 because E is ranked fourth 5 times. Now arrange the T/s in increasing order: TB &lt; TA &lt; TD &lt; TE &lt; Tc, yielding the seriated order: B?A?D?E?C Note: When the matrix can be permuted into a perfect Robinson matrix, as in this case, the estimated orders will be identical for each row; thus the calculation of the average ranks T? is trivial. See Gelfand (1971b:269) for further discussion and for an example in which the matrix is not capable of being permuted into perfect Robinson form. Figure 8.5.

MARQUARDT coefficient first suggested by Robinson (1951:300): the square of the negative differences divided by the sums of squares of all differences, both positive and negative. The higher the value of A or of B, the worse is the fit to the Robinson model. Testing on both ideal and empirical data (Kuzara et al. 1966:1453-1454) established the superiority of Kuzara's program over that of Ascher and Ascher in arranging data to fit the Robinson model. Hole and Shaw (1967) carried out an involved series of experiments, comparing the results of their own computerized seriations of stone tools, bone tools, and ceramics with results of the Meighan graphical technique, the Dempsey-Baumhoff approach, and the Ascher-Ascher matrix ordering program. The Hole-Shaw algorithm proceeds "by improving a given ordering by examining a selected set of related orderings which presumably contains the ones most likely to be improvements on the original" (Hole and Shaw 1967:15). A subset of the set of all possible orderings is examined, and a matrix coefficient (the sum of the errors? that is, the differences that are negative as one moves away from the diagonal) is calculated and evaluated for each ordering. The best ordering is retained in memory and can be the input ordering for the next cycle. Usually two or three such cycles are sufficient to find an ordering that cannot be further improved (Hole and Shaw 1967:16). The "permutation search" technique of Hole and Shaw does not provide dramatically better results than Meighan's simple graphical technique (Hole and Shaw 1967:69-77), but some of Hole and Shaw's difficulties resulted from badly chosen categories and inadequate sample sizes (Cowgill 1968b:519). A year after Hole and Shaw's contribution there appeared a new com puterized seriation technique by Cray tor and Johnson (1968). Cray tor created a coefficient //, which is the sum of all the coefficient differences (errors between a perfectly seriated matrix and the one under considera tion), and which considers the magnitude as well as the number of differ ences between similarity scores. Also, the H coefficient takes into ac count all between-score inequalities, not just those between adjacent scores. The H coefficient, when divided by the product of the number of tested inequalities with the standard deviations of the Vi (n2 - n) discrete similarity scores, creates matrix coefficient C, a measure that increases as the matrix becomes more perfectly seriated. Cray tor's program first generates a random sequencing of the units to be seriated, and calcu lates a similarity matrix therefrom. In a procedure similar to Kuzara's, every row-column of the similarity matrix is interchanged with every other until high H coefficients indicate high local maxima (relatively good seriations). The permutation search is repeated until the ordering coefficient H does not deviate significantly from the H value of the</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION previous search. Because the calculation of the H coefficient is based on the assumption that all inequalities have the same unit meaning, the Robinson index of agreement is an ideal measure of similarity for Craytor and Johnson (1968:11-12). The SERIATE program of Craytor was used successfully to order a series of 11 Late Tertiary vertebrate collections into reasonable ecological communities (Johnson 1968:13-14) and to seriate chronologically 26 Upper Paleolithic artifact collections (Johnson 1968:27-43). Low C coefficients in both cases suggested to Johnson the likelihood that there is no overall linear trend in either data set, and analysis with an unweighted pair-group (average-linkage) cluster analysis further partitions the sam ples. Craytor's algorithm is perhaps the most sophisticated and efficient of the computerized matrix-ordering techniques discussed thus far. How ever, it is affected by the initial random number supplied by the user. To be reasonably certain that a good seriation has been obtained, it is neces sary to run the program a number of times with different initial "random" numbers. A seriation technique proposed by de la Vega (1977) for the ordering of a similarity matrix makes use of both a clustering algorithm and an ordering algorithm. Within a subset of the units, the program produces a partition of the units into two groups, say a and ?, by use of an average linkage clustering technique. The partial order of elements in a and ? is improved according to calculations of F, which is proportional to the number of deviations from the perfect Robinson ordering. An advantage of the procedure is that the final ordering is independent of the starting order. The algorithm has been successful in ordering anthropomorphic statuary (Landau and de la Vega 1971). A detailed example of the al gorithm is provided by de la Vega (1977). The work of Goldmann (1971, 1972) provides an interesting example combining stratigraphie information, typological analysis, and an inci dence matrix-reordering technique. Goldmann set for himself the formid able task of refining a regional chronology applicable to about 4000 Bronze Age (about 2000-1400 b.c.) finds from northern, central, and southeastern Europe. Reducing the 4000 finds to about 900 assemblages, he performed a computer-assisted seriation of a 790-unit by 404-type incidence matrix, augmenting his decision-making process by the use of 51 different known stratigraphie sequences (Goldmann 1971:202). Arguing that formal similarity observed on artifacts by the ar chaeologist can be the result of "production-similarity" as well as "deposition-similarity," Goldmann believes that a combination of both lines of evidence is necessary to the establishment of a reliable relative chronology. If one can assume that similarity observed by the ar</page><page sequence="18">274 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT chaeologist corresponds to a genuine "type" reflecting an idea in the mind of the artifact's manufacturer, and if independent evidence is available to suggest that "the majority of objects grouped into one 'class of similarity' stems from a clearly delimited prehistoric period" (Goldmann 1971:202), then a relative chronology may be established through the seriation of judiciously chosen assemblages. In reality, not all assemblages will pro vide appropriate qualitative information, so the archaeologist must define among these assemblages "key-finds" {Leitfunde) containing representa tives of types he considers "relevant to his investigation" (Goldmann 1971:206). The matrix of key-finds is considered to be seriated when, in each column, Goldmann's (1972:20, 27) H coefficient is greater than or equal to 0.5. Goldmann's H is, for any given column (type), the total number of occurrences of the type divided by the inclusive range of the type; for example, if in column i of a seven-row incidence matrix, l's are recorded for rows 3, 4, 5, and 7, then Ht = 4/5 = 0.8. To my knowledge, Goldmann's is the largest matrix of archaeological data yet seriated by computer. His two FORTRAN programs ARCH and GGG were first tested extensively on 100 x 50 matrices; the final produc tion run on the complete 790 x 404 matrix required a little over an hour on an IBM 360-75 computer (Goldmann 1971:202). I have not examined these programs in detail; Wilkinson (1974:31) is of the opinion that Goldmann's programs are inefficient. The entire methodology admits considerable subjectivity, and, as Goldmann himself realizes, it is based on the rather generous assumptions that the assemblages are technologically similar and were comparably collected/excavated/reported. It is to Goldmann's credit that his assumptions and methodology are made explicit (see espe cially Goldmann 1972:1-28) enough to enable a thorough understanding and critique of his method. Wilkinson (1974) has also proposed a method for analyzing incidence data matrices directly. All archaeological seriation procedures are based on the assumption that there is a true chronological ordering of the units. If one makes the additional assumption, as Goldmann has, that there is a true chronological ordering of the artifact types, Wilkinson (1974:30-32) proposes a simple but very efficient heuristic algorithm for alternately ordering the rows and columns of an incidence matrix on the basis of the mean positions of the l's. The algorithm is as follows (Wilkinson 1974:31-32): (1) Calculate the mean positions for l's in the columns. (2) Order the columns according to these means. (3) Calculate the mean positions for l's in the rows. (4) Order the rows according to these means. (5) Repeat steps 1-4 until no improvement is possible. In practice, Wil kinson uses the fast AXIS program based on this algorithm to calculate a rough ordering, and then uses another program, POLISH, to refine the</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 275 seriation. Source listings of both programs are provided by Wilkinson (1974). Although they differ in specific detail, both Goldmann's ARCH and Wilkinson's AXIS algorithms are procedures for ordering incidence ma trices directly. All units and all types are weighted equivalently in deter mining the best ordering. I shall next describe two other approaches to the ordering of incidence matrices, one by Bordaz and Bordaz, which allows differential weighting of units, and one by Cowgill, which allows differen tial weighting of types. The Bordaz-Bordaz procedure begins with the calculation of a Tanimoto distance coefficient (Tanimoto 1961; Rogers and Tanimoto 1960) for each pair of provenience units. Then the units are clustered, and the unit most "typical" of each of the clusters is found. [Clustering procedures for archaeological data are discussed in some detail by Doran and Hodson (1975:173-186).] The most typical member of the cluster is also the most reliable; in information theoretic terms, it is that member which contains the least "noise"; geometrically, the typical member is that unit closest to the centroid of the points constituting the cluster (Bordaz and Bordaz 1970:233-234). An ordering, called by Bordaz and Bordaz a "skeleton" matrix, is established using the typical members alone. The other members of the clusters are then grouped in a systematic way about their respective "most typical" members, producing the final ordering. The Bordaz-Bordaz technique was shown to be successful on model data, satisfactorily ordering 90 excavation units from the Pe?itas site in Mexico. Bordaz and Bordaz use a computer to calculate the distance matrix, form the clusters, and find the typical member for each cluster. An ordering is produced using these typical members, then additional units are added by hand in such a way that (a) as few new characteristics are introduced as possible, and (b) those units having characteristics most similar to typical members are introduced first. The most innovative facet of the procedure is the initial weighting of certain units because they are more "typical." In Cowgill's (1972) procedure one computes a similarity coefficient between each pair of types (not between pairs of provenience units). Cowgill's similarity coefficient, here denoted as sc, is calculated as fol lows (Cowgill 1972:404): sc.f = 0 if ai5 is zero sCi. = 1 if either bi5 or cu is zero sc.. = (?ij + dtJ)/n otherwise where sc is the coefficient of similarity between types / andj, ai5 is the</page><page sequence="20">276 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT number of units in which both i and y occur, bi5 is the number of units in which type i is present but typej is absent, ctj is the number of units in which type/ is present but type / is absent, dtj is the number of units in which both / and j are absent, and n is the total number of units. As Cowgill notes, sc is equivalent to sSM, the simple matching coefficient (Sokal and Sneath 1963:133), for cases in which types i and j partially overlap (Cowgill 1972:398-410). A matrix of similarity coefficients thus obtained is analyzed by a standard MDSCAL (Shepard 1962a,b; Kruskal 1964a,b) multidimen sional scaling program, and the two-dimensional configuration is inspected in order to gauge the appropriateness of proceeding with a seriation. Working with an ideal matrix, Cowgill (1972:406-409) shows that the order of midpoints of the type ranges (where range means the total number of rows in which the type occurs) is retrieved effectively by MDSCAL. Working from the assumption that a type's probability of occurrence in a given unit is distributed normally with a mean at the predicted midpoint of the type's range and a standard deviation proportional to the number of units in which the type occurs, he derives a formula for predicting the occurrence points for units: ?.(?Ot, = (&gt;&gt;&gt;?) /?iM) i I X where U is some unit (row) in the incidence matrix, L is the predicted "location" of the unit U, xt is the predicted midpoint for type i (obtained from the MDSCAL configuration), n{ is the number of units in which type i occurs, and the summation is over all types occurring in unit U. The parameter/: can be either 1 or 2; in the former condition, less emphasis is given to scarce types in determining the predicted location of units. In either case, it can be seen that, if all the types occurring in unit U occur in the same number of units, the formula reduces to the mean of the pre dicted midpoints (the jc/s) for all types occurring in unit U (Cowgill 1972:407-422). Interestingly, Cowgill's weighted mean, L, may result in an ordering of the incidence matrix diverging somewhat from the ideal form, even when the data are capable of being cast into the ideal form. There is certainly no reason to make all our results consistent with the idealized model if we know some variables to be more reliable indicators of time trends than others. The inclusion of rare types of an equal standing with common types may introduce an undesirable bias toward the in frequent or idiosyncratic item. Cowgill (1972:420), for example, in work ing with empirical data, does not consider units having less than three types present. There is, of course, no guarantee that frequently found items are necessarily better indicators of temporal variation. At any rate, Cowgill's weighting technique provides an option that may be useful in</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 277 many cases. Another advantage of Cowgill's technique is that it can be used to seriate hundreds of units efficiently, provided that the number of types is not very large. Although computer program listings are not provided, Cowgill's (1972) procedure is so clearly described that any competent programmer could easily write his or her own program, pro vided that some sort of multidimensional scaling program were also avail able. Both Bordaz and Bordaz' and Cowgill's techniques are intended for the ordering of incidence data. In Cowgill's procedure, multidimensional scaling is used to estimate the relative positions of the midpoints of the type ranges. If one knows or has a reliable estimate of the date of a type's midpoint, the task of assigning relative dates to the units should be considerably easier. In fact, this is just what South (1977:201-274) has done for historic sites of Colonial America. Although South does not refer to the technique as "seriation," it seems appropriate to describe it here. Working from N?el Hume's (1970) extensive compendium, South first compiles a table of 78 ceramic types, assigning a median manufacturing date to each type. A simple formula is used to estimate a "mean ceramic date" for a given sample of ceramic fragments. m j m y- E XffifZf* where Xt is the median manufacturing date for each ceramic type, f is the frequency of each type, and the summation is over all m ceramic types represented in the sample. For example, suppose that a ceramic sample contains 30 fragments of a type known to have a median manufacturing date of 1760, 50 fragments of a type with a median date of 1775, and 50 fragments of a type with a median date of 1783. The calculation (1760X30) + (1775X50) + (1783)(50) 30 + 50 + 50 52800 + 88750 + 89150 230700 = - = - = 1774.6 130 130 yields 1774.6 as an estimate of the "mean ceramic date" for the sample. The investigator of historic sites often has access to documentary evi dence concerning dates of manufacture and patterns of commercial dis tribution of ceramics and other artifacts. These records can be used to confirm functional, social, economic, or other hypotheses about distribu tions of artifacts in time and space (South 1977:230-235). A number of individuals have used minimum path approaches to the</page><page sequence="22">278 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT seriation problem. Wilkinson (1971, 1974) realized that the question of rearranging an incidence matrix with the intention of bunching the l's together as closely as possible in each column is analogous to the classic graph theoretic question known as the Traveling Salesman problem (Bellmore and Nemhauser 1968). Although the problem has not been "solved"?that is, no nonexhausive algorithm has been discovered that will find the shortest tour for a salesman starting from a given city, visiting each of a specified group of cities, then returning to the origin of the tour?heuristic search techniques are known that provide good estimates of the solution. Such a re-entrant path is known as a Hamiltonian circuit (Tutte 1946; Flood 1956). Wilkinson's (1974:105-142) program employs a heuristic search technique in concert with a data-smoothing algorithm that preserves the chronological information contained in incidence matrices. Experiments on ideal and empirical data convinced Wilkinson that the best procedure would be to apply an algorithm that finds the maximum Hamiltonian circuit, given a similarity matrix (identical to the problem of finding the salesman's shortest path, given a distance matrix). The similarity matrix must be "smoothed" to mitigate the effect of "rogue" points (that is, graves that have very few similarities with other graves) (Wilkinson 1974:56-76). Wilkinson suggested that repeated "circle-powering" (see Figure 8.7 below) of a similarity matrix might yield a better-behaved matrix without substantial loss of information. Kadane (1972) also discusses minimum path solutions to the seriation problem. He applies the heuristic method of Little et al. (1963) to three data sets, comparing his results with those of Gelfand (1969) and Sternin (1965). Kadane's (1972:12) results are generally satisfactory, but seem to be no improvement over those of Gelfand. The Traveling Salesman prob lem will be discussed more extensively below. Several seriation techniques reported in the past few years have utilized one form or another of multidimensional scaling, sometimes called "prox imity analysis." Speaking generally, multidimensional scaling techniques fashion a geometric representation of the pattern of a matrix of similarities such that the rank-order of geometric distance between points is the inverse of the rank-order of similarities between the units being analyzed. The geometric space (sometimes called a "hyperspace" when more than two dimensions are involved) necessary to represent n units in multi dimensional space consists of n - 1 dimensions. Often it happens that the rank-order of interpoint distances can be preserved, or nearly preserved, in fewer dimensions than the originally required n - 1 dimensions. By means of an iterative procedure, the number of dimensions in which the data are represented is reduced by 1, and a measure of "stress" is calculated that is proportional to the number of violations of the original</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 279 rank-order. This process is repeated, expressing the data in fewer and fewer dimensions, until the calculated stress becomes too large for adequate representation of the rank-order of interpoint distances. If a body of archaeological data is capable of being seriated well, it can be represented with little stress in only one dimension. [In practice, it is usually advisable to examine the two-dimensional solution, even when the calculations indicate a good fit is possible in one dimension; see Kendall (1969b:73), Kruskal (1971:129-131), Cowgill (1972:397), and Sibson (1977:84) for comments on this point.] The optimal configuration is influ enced by the random number supplied to the computer for the purpose of generating the starting configuration. Hence, multidimensional scaling programs are usually run several times on the same data with different starting configurations; if nearly identical configurations appear several times, it is likely that the best one has been obtained. Examples of multidimensional scaling procedures are the MDSCAL program de veloped by Shepard (1962a,b) and Kruskal (1964a,b), the TORSCA pro gram of Torgerson and Young (Young 1968), and the versatile Small Space Analysis package developed by Guttman and Lingoes (Lingoes 1973; see Green and Carmone 1970:42-53 for an interesting comparison of these three approaches). A basic introduction to multidimensional scaling is given by Shepard (1972:1-12). Further information concerning the theory and uses of multidimensional scaling can be found in the book edited by Shepard et al. (1972; see also Green and Rao 1972; Sibson 1977). Multidimensional scaling approaches to the seriation problem were advocated by Cowgill (1968a:374, 1968b:519) several years ago. Early uses of multidimensional scaling in archaeology were by Hodson et al. (1966), Doran and Hodson (1966), and McPherron (1967). More recent contributions are those of True and Matson (1970), Ammerman (1971), Kruskal (1971), Kendall (1969b, 1970, 1971a), Lingoes (1970), Cowgill (1972), LeBlanc (1975), Drennan (1976), and Graham et al. (1976). A good example of an explicit use of multidimensional scaling for chronological seriation is that reported by Kendall. Kendall's work has contributed significantly to seriation theory as well as to practical seria tion techniques. Although his theoretical contributions will be placed in context below, a discussion is necessary here to provide a background for the discussion of a number of techniques. Stimulated by the work of Fulkerson and Gross (1965) on incidence matrices, Kendall proved (1969a) that if an incidence matrix I were capable of being permuted into the ideal "P?trie" (or P-matrix) form (that is, having all the l's bunched together in each individual column), then that same permutation when applied to the matrix G = llT would give that square matrix the ideal</page><page sequence="24">280 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT "Robinson" form. To transpose a matrix, one simply exchanges its rows and columns (indicated symbolically by a superscript T). Matrix G is the product of I with the transpose of I. Matrix multiplication is not difficult, but there is not room in this chapter to explain the process adequately (for a useful introduction to matrix algebra for the nonmathematician, see Davis 1973:127-169). For purposes of the present discussion, it is conve nient to think of the matrix G as composed of elements gi5 representing the number of criteria (for example, artifact types) present in both the ith and Jth units (for example, graves) (see Figure 8.6.). Cautiously translating this mathematical conclusion to an archaeological context, Kendall (1969b:74) demonstrated that a MDSCAL multidimensional scaling of matrix G produces reliable orderings of the units. For the example shown in Figure 8.6, the indicated MDSCAL order is B?C?E?A?F?D (or D?F?A?E?C?B) (the reader can rearrange the matrices G and I in Figure 8.6 to verify that G becomes an ideal "Robinson" matrix and I becomes an ideal "P?trie" matrix). Kendall (1971b) later generalized this Example: Units A and B have no criteria in common, so gAB = 0; units A and C have criterion 1 and criterion 4 in common, so gAC = 2; and so on. Criterion 12 3 4 5 6 Unit A 10 0 110 B 0 0 10 0 1 C 11110 1 D 0 0 0 0 10 E 111110 F 10 0 0 10 Unit A B C D E F Unit A 3 0 2 13 2 B 0 2 2 0 10 C 2 2 5 0 4 1 D 110 111 E 3 14 15 2 F 2 0 112 2 Figure 8.6.

Incidence matrix I Similarity matrix G = IF</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 281 result for abundance matrices, proving that, if an abundance matrix A were capable of being permuted into the ideal Q-matrix (that is, for each column the numbers increase, or decrease, or increase and then decrease, all in the weak sense), then that same permutation when applied to the matrix S = A ? Ar would give the ideal "Robinson" form. Matrix S is the "circle product" of A with the transpose of A. That is, m S = (A o A7)^ = ^ min(ai?, ajh) An example, with already familiar data, is given in Figure 8.7. It will be noted that, in this case, A ? Aris proportional to Robinson's IA (compare Figure 8.7 with Tables 8.4 and 8.5); this will occur whenever each row (unit) of A contains proportions summing to 1.0 (or percentages summing to 100%) (Kendall 1971b: 109). Again, Kendall shows (1971a) that a MDSCAL analysis of an S = (A ? A7) matrix can yield an appropriate linear arrangement of archaeological units. Experimenting with ideal data, Kendall (1970:128-129, 197la:225-227) found that the correct order was recovered in a horseshoe-shaped curve. Next, the method was applied to the familiar M?nsingen-Rain cemetery data (Hodson 1968), resulting, Type Unit 12 3 4 A .00 .20 .10 .70 B .00 .40 .05 .55 C .50 .00 .00 .50 Abundance matrix A D .10 .10 .10 .70 E .20 .00 .05 .75 m Sy = (A o A7)? = X m?n(uiA&gt; aih) Example 4 For units A and B, sAB = ^ min(aA?, aBh) = min (0., 0.) + min (.20, .40) + min (.10, .05) + min (.70, .55) = .0 + .20 + .05 + .55 = .80 Unit Unit A B C D E A 1.00 .80 .50 .90 .75 B .80 1.00 .50 .70 .60 C .50 .50 1.00 .60 .70 Similarity matrix S = A ?

Starting at one end of the configuration and reading around the curve to the opposite end, a chronological sequence was obtained that was very close to Hodson's seriation and that was, as well, consonant with the map of the Miin singen-Rain cemetery (Kendall 197la:227-229). With further experimen tation, Kendall was able to "unbend" the horseshoe by inputting to MCSCAL a similarity matrix, S' = (S ? S), derived from the first similarity matrix (Kendall 1971a:220, 229-236) and opting for a primary, rather than secondary, treatment of ties in the data [see Kruskal (1964a:22) for a discussion of two alternatives for treating tied dis similarities in a MDSCAL analysis]. Once the horseshoe has been straightened, it is a simple matter to pass a principal component through the two-dimensional array of points, thus arriving at a satisfactory one dimensional seriation of the units. In another application of the "horse shoe" technique, Boneva (1971) successfully seriated the works of Plato. In 1975 LeBlanc published a paper in which he calls attention to the limitations of chronological seriation based on "types" alone. He advo cates the use of similarity coefficients derived from relative frequencies of certain attributes of a given variable (for example, the variable "paint type" might have the four possible attributes?"matte," "light sub glaze," "heavy subglaze," and "glaze"). Although he calls his resulting coefficients Brainerd-Robinson coefficients, they are not. They are actu ally dissimilarity coefficients computed by first standardizing each attri bute so that rare attributes are given as much weight as common ones. An example of the calculation of LeBlanc's standardized dissimilarity coefficient for one pair of units for one given variable is shown in Figure 8.8. After these manipulations, one has annx? matrix of dissimilarity coefficients for each variable, where n is the number of units; in Le Blanc's (1975:29-31) example, this would be four 26 x 26 dissimilarity matrices, based on the variables "slip," "paint," "hue," and "line width." At this point, one has the option of seriating each variable independently. If one wishes to assume that each variable is an equally good indicator of the time trend, all the dissimilarity matrices can be added together. Additionally, of course, it is necessary to standardize the dissimilarity matrices to enable their meaningful combination (LeBlanc 1975:31). LeBlanc (1975:31-35) displays the results of Guttman-Lingoes (Guttman 1968; Lingoes 1973) multidimensional scaling analysis on each dissimilarity matrix, then on the combined matrix; the results are best with the combined matrix. He also produces an acceptable ordering using only the factor scores obtained from a factor analysis. This procedure will be discussed below.

Standardize the attribute "white/red" by setting the maximum value in the column equal to 100, the minimum value equal to 1: Max (white/red) = 6.8 is set equal to 100; Min (white/red) = 0.0 is set equal to 1.

Standardize the attribute "red" in the same manner: Max (red) = 88.7 is set equal to 100; Min (red) = 69.4 is set equal to 1. (100 - 1) (99X76.3) Unit 1 (red) = ?:-:? x (76.3) = ?- = 35.4 (88.7 - 69.4) (19.3) Un?t 2 (red) = (1?? ' ? x (83.8) = (")(83-8) = 73.9 (88.7 - 69.4) (19.3) 3. Standardize the attribute "white" in the same manner: Max (white) = 30.6 is set equal to 100; Min (white) = 5.6 is set equal to 1. (100 - 1) (99X19.1) Unit 1 (white) = ?-? x (19.1) = ??- = 53.5 (30.6 - 5.6) (25) (100 - 1) (99X11.1) Unit 2 (white) = ?-? x (11.1) = ?- = 21.8 (30.6 - 5.6) (25) 4. Thus, the resulting values for unit 1 and unit 2 on the "slip" variable, which is composed of the three attributes, are as follows: White/red Red White Unit 1 67.0 35.4 53.5 Unit 2 74.3 73.9 21.8 5. Now find the absolute value of the difference for each attribute and sum them to obtain a pooled dissimilarity coefficient: |67.0 - 74.3j + |35.4 - 73.9? + |53.5 - 21.8J = 7.3 + 38.5 + 31.7 = 77.5 which is LeBlanc's dissimilarity coefficient between unit 1 and unit 2 for the variable "slip."

MARQUARDT tically derived variables is generally a sound one. A Q-mode (across units) factor analysis or any of the forms of multidimensional scaling will proba bly produce acceptable seriations if the variables being used are primarily sensitive to temporal variation. I advocated the use of factor analysis for ascertaining trend-sensitive variables in an earlier work (Marquardt 1974b:92-121), and I agree with LeBlanc's (1975:22-28) opinion that variables based on attribute frequencies are better indicators of change in artifact morphology than are traditional artifact "types," such as the ceramic types used by Ford (1962). I have reservations about the manner in which LeBlanc combines dissimilarity coefficients, however. Although he is cognizant (LeBlanc 1975:30) of the increased danger of sampling errors when rare attributes are given as much weight as common attri butes, it seems to me that such errors may be even more serious than he realizes, especially when masked by the repeated standardizations neces sary for the combining of attributes and combining of variables. Also, I do not believe that "micro-seriation," defined by LeBlanc (1975:22) as tech niques "which deal with cultural material that falls within periods of 50 or perhaps 100 years," should be distinguished logically from any other kind of seriation; the assumptions are clearly the same. It is not the shortness of the time range or the use of this or that multivariate technique, but the availability of sufficiently complex, well-controlled data that makes fine grained seriations possible. Robert Drennan has used multidimensional scaling to order materials from the Middle Formative site of F?brica San Jos?. Drennan's unit of analysis is the provenience unit, the variables being counts of various attributes observed on ceramics (decoration, details of vessel form, etc.). He generates a dissimilarity coefficient based on the quantity obtained by summing, for each pair of units, the absolute difference in percentages, and dividing the result by 200: p _ p Drennan's A; = ? 200 a=l where Di5 represents the dissimilarity between unit i and unity, m is the number of attributes, Pia is the percentage of occurrence of the ath attribute in unit /, and Pja is the percentage of occurrence of the ath attribute in unity. The coefficient thus ranges from 0.0 (units i and j have identical percentages) to 1.0 (/ and y are maximally dissimilar). Drennan used the multidimensional scaling program MINISSA-I (Lingoes 1973) to obtain a two-dimensional solution for 22 stratigraphie provenience units from four excavations, obtaining a dispersed but interpretable configura tion (Drennan 1976:293-296). Further interpretation of the pattern as a</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 285 "time curve" was aided in this case by a form of localized nonmetric multiple regression in which best fitting lines, or vectors, are passed through the swarms of points symbolizing the units of each of the four excavations. The points were then projected back onto the curve, to form what Drennan (1976:296) calls a "time curve hypothesis." Additional provenience units were then added to the curve one at a time according to D coefficients calculated between the candidate units and each of the 22 units already plotted on the time curve. Drennan (1976:298) found that mixed proveniences and units with small sample sizes could not be scaled reliably. Drennan's statement that the ultimate criterion for determining whether a provenience is mixed is "whether the frequencies of occur rence of the various states [show] strong characteristics of more than one segment of the sequence" seems to beg the question: Why not simply use typological and stratigraphie information to form the sequence? Subjec tive intervention was necessary at several points in Drennan's analysis. The problem probably lies not in the application of multidimensional scaling, but in Drennan's failure to assure that the variables used were primarily sensitive to temporal changes. Wilkinson (1974:71-76) has also used multidimensional scaling in seria tion, introducing certain modifications of the MDSCAL procedure of Kruskal. Wilkinson's LOCSCAL algorithm involves the calculation of a separate regression for each unit rather than performing a single regres sion on the interpoint distance matrix. Wilkinson also suggests altering the form of the stress function in order to give less weight to very unusual units (see Sibson 1977 for a detailed discussion of "global" and "local" scaling). Sibson (1972) proposed that a useful dissimilarity coefficient for analy sis by multidimensional scaling is one derived by pairwise rank compari son, a modification of the rank correlation coefficient of M. Kendall (see Figure 8.9). The application of Sibson's transformation has the effect of smoothing data so that multidimensional scaling programs are better able to find local minima. In addition, it has intuitive appeal because it would seem to take into account not only the similarity or dissimilarity of two objects with one another, but the patterns of similarity or dissimilarity values with other objects (Sibson 1971). Further explanation of dissimilar ity measurement may be found in Jardine and Sibson (1971:3-34). An interesting series of experiments in the computer-assisted seriation of incidence data has been reported by Graham et al. (1976). They gener ated a series of four simulated Merovingian cemeteries, the graves varying in number and in diversity of "grave goods" present in each grave. The four data sets were submitted to Wilkinson's (1974) program AXIS and to AXIS used in conjunction with his program POLISH. Also, similarity</page><page sequence="30">286 WILLIAM H.

Coefficients of similarity used were (a) a matching coefficient, which simply records the total number of types held in common by a given pair of graves, and (b) the Jaccard coefficient (Sokal and Sneath 1963:133), consisting of the number of types held in common by a pair of graves divided by the total number of times in which a type is present in either of the two graves. Finally, the effects of two different transformations of these coefficients were investigated? namely, the circle product transformation of Kendall (1971b; see also Figure 8.7, this chapter) and Sibson's (1972) pairwise rank comparison transformation (Figure 8.9; see also Graham et al. 1976:4-13). Appro priateness of the various seriations was gauged by visual examination of representations of the orderings and by calculating Kendall's (Kendall 1975) rank-order correlation coefficient with the "true" order of the simulated graves. It was found that Wilkinson's programs AXIS and POLISH gave good results, especially when used in concert (annotated source listings of these programs are given in Wilkinson 1974:105-142). Interestingly, the Sibson transformation, so successfully applied to the empirical Miinsingen-Rain data (Sibson 1972), caused consistently poorer results when used on the simulated data. Kendall's circle product transformation led to somewhat poorer results than the Sibson transformation, and seemed erratic at best. Contrary to Wilkinson's (1974:60-63) prediction, successive circle powering seems to worsen, rather than better, the se riations. The MDSCAL and LOCSCAL scaling techniques were adjudged equally effective in producing reasonable orderings. The work of Graham, Galloway, and Scollar, although inconclusive, establishes beyond doubt that the performance of practical seriation tech niques is significantly affected by the characteristics of the data sets themselves (for example, number of graves, diversity of grave goods). Their study again underscores the need for corroborative data to aid the interpretation of computer-generated sequences. Multidimensional scal ing techniques have been utilized effectively to order archaeological units, but we must continue to evaluate in every case the appropriateness of the result. In the absence of corroboraron in the form of stratigraphy, den drochronology, or other evidence, computer-generated orderings must always be considered hypothetical. I should like to end this section with brief descriptions of factor analytic approaches to chronological ordering. Factor analysis is actually a set of models and techniques, rather than a discrete mathematical procedure.</page><page sequence="32">288 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT Essentially, the goal of factor analysis is to find the minimum number of independent axes necessary to reproduce the variation of the data matrix in a vector space. Originally developed in psychology in an effort to express quantitatively the underlying factors determining individual be havior, factor analytic applications have extended to a wide scale of social and behavioral sciences. Archaeological applications have appeared in print only in the past dozen or so years (e.g., Binford and Binford 1966; Daniels 1967; Glover 1969; Hill 1970; Ahler 1971; Rowlett and Pollnac 1971; Redman 1973; Roper 1974), and productive critical discussion (e.g., Benfer 1972; Doran and Hodson 1975:187-213; Lischka 1975; Read 1974; Roper 1975, 1976; Christenson and Read 1977) has been seen even more recently. Factor analysis is closely related to principal components analysis, a procedure by which linear relationships are sought within multivariate data sets. Geometrically, one can visualize a swarm of points in m-dimensional space, where m is the number of variables. The first ("principal") axis passes through the ellipsoid of maximum density of the points?that is, the linear relationship of maximum covariance. Each suc cessive axis extracted from the data set is orthogonal to and uncorrelated with all previously extracted axes (geometrically, all the axes are at right angles to one another). Often it happens that the first few axes extracted will account for most of the variance in the data, and the remainder can be ignored. This has the effect of parsimoniously reducing data complexity and considerably simplifying interpretation. One of the most frequently chosen factor analytic models is that known as "common" factor analysis (Rummel 1970:104-112). This model in cludes the assumption that the unique parts of the variance attributable to each individual variable are uncorrelated. This contrasts with the princi pal component model described above, in which all variance?common, specific, and error?is considered at once in defining the patterns of variation. It should be noted, for the benefit of the beginning student of factor analysis, that published terminology is inconsistent regarding the "principal component" model. Some writers refer to a procedure utilizing the component model with the principal axes technique as "principal components factor analysis" (e.g., see Benfer 1975:373-375). Some writers see the distinction between principal components analysis and factor analysis as a difference in emphasis: Whereas principal-components analysis is primarily concerned with the definition of linear functions of composite scores having certain optimal statistical properties, factor analysis is concerned with relationships among test vari?tes and relationships of the test vari?tes to derived factors [Overall and Klett 1972:111].</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 289 Others favor a sharp distinction between principal components analysis and factor analysis; Doran and Hodson (1975:187-205), for example, express a definite preference for the former. Still others (e.g., Christenson and Read 1977:166) use "factor analysis" as a generic term to refer to all procedures that are used to reduce the dimensionality in a series of correlated measurements, thus including principal components analysis as a subset of factor analysis. I use the term "component factor analysis" below to mean a procedure using the component model (that is, all variance considered at once) (Rummel 1970:112-113, 312-313) with the principal axes factoring technique (Rummel 1970:99, 142, 168, 338-345). [In a previous paper (Marquardt 1974a) I used the term "principal com ponents factor analysis" for this same procedure.] My own approach to the seriation problem has made use of component factor analysis at two stages of investigation: (1) finding trend-sensitive variables and (2) ordering units on the basis of these trend-sensitive variables. The procedure has produced good results when applied both to artificial data (Marquardt 1977) and to empirical data (Marquardt 1974b; Wynn 1976). I have found that, when independent evidence is available, a component factor analysis can distinguish variables that are primarily sensitive to temporal trends from variables primarily sensitive to other linear trends within the data. The process involves several steps, which can be summarized briefly here; further details can be found in Marquardt (1974b, 1977). The procedure begins with the creation of an n x m data matrix of n units (rows) and m ratio-scale variables (columns). (By ratio-scale I mean variables that are real number measurements or products, such that a value of zero has meaning for the variable; examples might be the ratio of black polished pottery sherds to the total number of polished pottery sherds in a given provenience unit; the average number of "checks" per square centimeter in a sample of "check-stamped" pottery; the percent age of all red-slipped bowl sherds in a provenience unit which have black painted designs.) The variables are chosen in such a way that they are as independent from one another as possible (for example, if one of the proposed variables is the percentage of slipped pottery in a given unit that is white, we shall not also include a variable that records the percentage of slipped pottery that is red). The data matrix that eventually results will include variables that independent evidence suggests are time-sensitive, variables suspected to be time-sensitive, and variables known not to be time-sensitive. A Pearson's r correlation matrix is calculated, and this m x m similarity matrix is factor-analyzed, using the principal axes tech nique. If there is a strong linear trend in the data set, the principal axes</page><page sequence="34">290 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT technique will assure that the first factor extracted will account for the variance of the maximum linear relationship. If the known time-sensitive variables have been judiciously chosen, they will load highly on (that is, will be highly correlated with) a single factor. The sign of each loading will indicate the direction of the trend relative to other high-loading variables. Variables that load highly on the same factor as the known time-sensitive variables may be inferred to be good candidates for additional time sensitive variables. As a rule of thumb, I expect the first two factors to account for at least 50% of the variance; any less than this amount should call for a re-evaluation of the variables. It is good practice to include one or two "nonsense" variables as a check; I have used a vector of random numbers for this purpose. Variables that load with nonsense variables are viewed with suspicion. To summarize, when independent evidence is available, a factor analy sis can be used to define useful time-sensitive variables. The candidate variables are ratio-scale measurements, averages, percentages, or pro portions that are composed in such a way that they are logically indepen dent. Additionally included among the variables are some expected, on the basis of supplementary evidence, to be time-sensitive, and others not expected to be time-sensitive. An R-mode (across variables) factor analy sis of an m x m correlation matrix, using the principal axes technique, will disclose a main factor attributable to "time," and the "known" time sensitive variables will load highly on this factor. Additional variables loading highly on the factor are inferred also to be time-sensitive. The most reliable trend-sensitive variables (TSV's) are {a) those based on logically independent measures, (b) those generally increasing or gener ally decreasing through time, and (c) those possessing few "zero" readings. Once the first part of the two-step operation (creating a number of reliable trend-sensitive variables) is solved, the second part (determining the proper order of the units, based on the trend-sensitive variables) is a good deal easier. Using only the TSV's determined in step 1, one gener ates an n x n matrix of similarity coefficients and analyzes this matrix with a Q-mode (across units) factor analytic technique or one of the various multidimensional scaling programs. I have obtained good order ings on both ideal and empirical data by using a component factor analysis for which the input is an n x n matrix of similarity coefficients ranging in value from 0.0 (maximum dissimilarity) to 1.0 (maximum similarity). One similarity coefficient satisfying this criterion is the scaled taxonomic dis tance coefficient A*, where Al = 1.0 - (Ajfc/Amax)</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 291 (m m m . 1^ X X% + ? X\t - 2 ? Z* Zfci l 1=1 ?=1 ?=1 / where Amax is the largest of the Aj?'s; Xn is the element of the n x m data matrix at the intersection of row (unit)j and column (variable) /; Xki is the element of the n x m data matrix at the intersection of row (unit) k and column (variable) i; n is the number of rows (units); m is the number of columns (variables); Ajfc is the taxonomic distance between units J and k. It should be clear that the Affc (scaled taxonomic distance) coefficient is actually a similarity coefficient ranging in value from zero (minimum similarity) to unity (maximum similarity). The n x n matrix of scaled distance coefficients is factor-analyzed, the two most significant factors (that is, the first two to be extracted) being retained for consideration. The loadings of all n units on each of the two factors are plotted on a two-dimensional graph. The variables are primar ily sensitive to a particular linear trend; hence the order of the units on the graph will indicate their relative score on this linear trend. In the case of chronological seriation, one factor-analyses an n x n similarity matrix calculated from variables known to be primarily sensitive to temporal variation (see Marquardt 1974b:64-184, 1977). I have found that the plot of the loadings on factors 1 and 2 usually takes the form of a crescent-shaped scatter of points (Marquardt 1977: Figs. 1 and 2). Elsewhere I provide three techniques for the generation of a one-dimensional ordering of the units, each of which provides a good estimate of the minimum Hamiltonian circuit through the points (Mar quardt 1974b: 152-163). I also suggest rules of thumb for estimating taxonomic contemporaneity (1974b: 163-169). Another approach to step 2 (the ordering of units on the basis of trend-sensitive variables) is LeBlanc's (1975:30-31) procedure of plotting the factor scores for the principal factor, reading the order directly from the plot. A factor score (Rummel 1970:108) is a measure of a unit's contribution to the variance accounted for by a certain factor. If we feel comfortable with the interpretation of the principal factor as "time," then LeBlanc's technique has intuitive appeal. Use of the principal axes factor ing technique will assure that a large part of the variance will be accounted for by the first factor extracted. If one takes pains to "stack the deck" so that most of the variance in the unit x variable data matrix is temporal</page><page sequence="36">292 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT variance, then it is probably safe to think that the principal factor will be attributable to time. It should be evident that most advances in seriation technique have been concerned with improving ordering procedures, which I have called step 2. Very little attention has been given to step 1: the process of generating data matrices that contain information explicitly appropriate to the archaeological seriation problem. The simulation experiments of Graham et al. (1976) show that the performance of certain ordering techniques and matrix transformations varies from data set to data set. Mathematicians, statisticians, and com puter programmers have contributed an invaluable perspective to our work, but we archaeologists cannot expect them to solve our chronologi cal problems for us. We must continue to re-evaluate the cultural assump tions tacitly underlying our ordering procedures, and we must devote some time to ascertaining the kinds of data appropriate for the archaeolog ical questions we ask. It does no good to have efficient matrix ordering techniques if we are uncertain of the data contained in the matrices. Surely, at the least, temporal, functional, spatial, stylistic, and idiosyn cratic variance characterizes our raw data. This does not even take into account postdepositional processes. If archaeologists want chronological orderings, they must develop methods of distinguishing, in each instance, variables primarily sensitive to temporal change from those primarily sensitive to other factors. ADVANCES IN SERIATION THEORY It is important to differentiate the mathematical aspects of seriation from its application in archaeology and other fields. The essence of the mathematical seriation problem is this: Given a matrix of n rows and m columns of which the elements are nonnegative real numbers, find the permutation of rows that best satisfies this criterion: In each column the elements increase to a maximum and then decrease, or increase, or decrease, in the "weak" sense (two or more consecutive identical ele ments do not violate the criterion). The principles of the technique were used by P?trie (1899) to "sequence-date" 900 graves excavated in Egypt during the years 1894-1899. The task was accomplished in part by a thorough analysis of 804 varieties of pottery classified into nine larger groups and the arrangement of the graves in serial order based on the presence of certain varieties. In Petrie's work one finds the first articula tion of what Kendall (1963:659) has called the Concentration Principle: Other things being equal, arrangements that reduce the ranges of varieties</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 293 are to be preferred to those that do not. A detailed study of Petrie's work led Kendall (1963) to propose an analytical formulation of the Concentra tion Principle applicable to abundance matrices. Assuming the number of items of a given type in a given unit to be distributed as a Poisson variable, Kendall (1963:664) derived a scoring function, the minimization of which results in a seriation. Later, Wilkinson (1974:77-80) proposed two prob abilistic models for incidence matrices, the first based on the assumption that there is a fixed probability that a unit contains a given artifact type, the second based on the assumption that there is a fixed probability that a representative of a type in general use is contained in the unit. Both Kendall's and Wilkinson's probabilistic models, while intrinsically in teresting, incorporate assumptions probably unsuited to actual ar chaeological application. In 1965, Fulkerson and Gross proposed a graph theoretic method for casting an incidence matrix into the ideal P?trie form. They were con cerned with incidence matrices in which the rows represented mutant micro-organisms, the columns the intersections of mutant genes, but the mathematical objective is the same: reordering the rows to produce a matrix with column-consecutive l's. Kendall's (1969a,b) important exten sion of Fulkerson and Gross's work and his later generalization of it to abundance matrices (Kendall 1971a,b) have been discussed above. Wilkinson (1971, 1974) realized the similarity between the archaeologi cal seriation problem and the Traveling Salesman problem, a question that has received considerable interest in operations research (Ackoff 1956:278). A historical review of the Traveling Salesman problem is found in Bellmore and Nemhauser (1968). Various heuristic solutions are dis cussed by Dantzig et al. (1954), Croes (1958), Little et al. (1963), Netter (1971), Christofides and Eilon (1972), and Lin and Kernighan (1973). The Traveling Salesman problem is equivalent to the task of minimizing the sum of dissimilarity coefficients between adjacent units. Laporte (1976) suggests that this procedure is more appropriate for small matrices, while the procedure of minimizing the "score," suggested by Doran and Powell (1972), is more appropriate for large matrices. The score (Laporte 1976:251) is simply the sum, over all columns, of the range of the nonzero elements in each column (see also Doran and Hodson 1975:277). Robinson (Brainerd 1951; Robinson 1951; Matthews 1963; Kendall 1963) seems to have been the first to realize that an n x n matrix of between-unit similarity coefficients would have higher values near the principal diagonal if the units were arranged in a perfect seriation. In general, the grouping of high values of any similarity matrix together is of practical value. Sokal and Sneath (1963:175-179) discuss the shading of a similarity matrix according to the strength of the similarity, darker</page><page sequence="38">294 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT squares indicating higher values, and mention (1963:178) that "one can visualize the search for group structure as a rearranging of rows and columns ... in such a way as to obtain the optimum structure in the system." The systematic grouping of comparable units together at certain levels of computed similarity is called cluster analysis, a term that, like factor analysis, includes a wide range of models and techniques. [Cluster ana lytic applications in archaeology are described by Cowgill (1968a), Doran and Hodson (1975:173-185), and Hodson (1970); see also Hodson et al. (1971).] Johnson (1968, 1972) advocates the use of seriation as a first step in the search for meaningful clusters, adopting the shading procedure described by Sokal and Sneath (see, e.g., Johnson 1972:349, Figure 8.14). A similar application of matrix ordering as a preliminary analytical proce dure is described by McCormick et al. (1972). Their sorting algorithm proceeds by a permutation search technique, placing each column in such a way that the "measure of effectiveness" (a value proportional to the sums of products of neighboring elements, taken over both rows and columns) obtains its maximum value. McCormick et al. 's technique is applicable to any matrix with nonnega tive elements, including nonsymmetric abundance matrices (called by them "object-attribute" matrices). They illustrate this procedure by suc cessfully clustering ordinal data from 53 aircraft types and 37 aircraft functions, each element of the matrix being a score of 0, 1, or 2, indicating the aircraft's ability to perform the given function. Although the authors (McCormick et al. 1972:1008) see wider applications for their "bond energy" algorithm, I believe that "clustering" techniques such as theirs and Johnson's are methodologically suspect except in very special cases in which a single linear dimension can be demonstrated to account for most of the variance (see Doran and Hodson 1975:169-177 for a more detailed consideration of this point). Interestingly, McCormick et al. perceive their problem as part of a general class of allocation problems called in operations research Quad ratic Assignment problems. Similarities between seriation and the Quad ratic Assignment problem have been pointed out in an important series of papers by Hubert and Schultz (Hubert 1976; Hubert and Schultz 1976a,b). Lenstra (1974) has noted that any clustering problem of the type consid ered by McCormick et al. can be stated as p Traveling Salesman prob lems, wherep is the number of dimensions. Generalizing from the work of Wilkinson (1971) and Lenstra (1974), L?pez et al. (1976) note that, with a modified measure of performance, the bond-energy algorithm of McCor mick et al. is also equivalent to doing two independent seriations: one for the rows and one for the columns.</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 295 It should be stressed that matrix ordering techniques that simply bring higher values together are not necessarily relevant to the seriation prob lem. For example, Deutsch and Martin (1971) describe an efficient al gorithm that accomplishes this task by alternatively rearranging rows and columns on the basis of calculated row and column moments. [An identi cal procedure is reported by de la Vega (1977), who attributes the al gorithm to Tonnelier.] Their method is successful in "clustering" high values about the diagonal, and, in fact, they show (Deutsch and Martin 1971:1361-1362) in an archaeological example that an n x n matrix of Robinson's I A coefficients can be successfully rearranged by their ap proach. But, although for seriation this will be useful for ordering an n x n similarity matrix, the clustering of high values about the diagonal of an a x m data matrix will not necessarily produce an acceptable seriation. In sum, the graph theoretic concept of the Hamiltonian circuit has provided a valuable perspective on seriation theory, and the work of Wilkinson and Kendall is especially important in this development. Obvi ously, seriation, the Traveling Salesman problem, and the Quadratic Assignment problem are closely related (see Hubert 1974 for a formal consideration of these problems in graph theoretic terms; Hill 1974 pro vides an instructive comparison of seriation with principal components analysis, "correspondence analysis," and canonical correlations). Al though developments in operations research can result in progress in seriation theory, archaeologists must continue to evaluate the appro priateness of various methods to archaeological problems. There is al ways a tendency to apply techniques from other fields immediately be cause they have been shown to be effective for homologous problems. However, formal similarities may mask important differences in assump tions and objectives. We must avoid the uncritical adoption of theory as steadfastly as we resist the uncritical application of techniques. SERIATION IN CONTEXT Between the ideal models of seriation theory and the various practical seriation techniques employed by archaeologists lies the less frequently discussed realm of seriation epistemology. Among the many relevant questions that might be asked are: Are the assumptions of seriation theory appropriate? What kinds of artifacts or attributes of artifacts are likely to be reliable temporal indicators? What kinds of situations are likely to promote rapid technological change? rapid stylistic change? What hap pens to the rate of technological or stylistic innovation in times of stress? in times of cultural contact? How can we be reasonably certain for a given</page><page sequence="40">296 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT assemblage that we have isolated temporal variance, from, say, functional, stylistic, idiosyncratic, or error variance? Whallon (1972:32) noted several years ago that the mathematical de velopment of seriation had reached a greater level of sophistication than had archaeologists' knowledge of the nature of archaeological data. His assess ment is still true today, but some progress has been made in the latter direction. Advances in the epistemology of seriation have included critical examinations of seriation's underlying assumptions; its relationship to chronological inference in both real and simulated material cultural con texts; and the exploration of alternative strategies for chronological inves tigation. In one of the most thorough discussions of the appropriateness of chronological seriation in various archaeological contexts, Rouse de lineates five major areas of concern: (a) the units to be seriated, (b) the traits characterizing these units, (c) the cultural tradition, (d) the local area, (e) the historical pattern. He suggests that "events" are what are ideally seriated (1967:158), but he also recognizes that "some length of time is required to produce any unit of seriation" (1967:162). Fabrication units, deposition units, and occupation units are all proper items for seriation, but in all cases Rouse considers it advisable that units be unambiguously identifiable, and complex enough to provide recognizable, chronologically significant trait associations. Criteria for characterization of the units should be established on the basis of the kind of unit and the purpose of the seriation. Thus, Rouse suggests that fabrication units be seriated with respect to "the pattern of occurrence of their modes" (where a mode consists of a series of attributes recurring on correspond ing features of a number of artifacts), that large deposition units be seriated on the basis of relative type frequencies (as Ford has done), and that components and other habitation units be seriated in phases, accord ing to the developmental pattern within their local cultural tradition. To be reliable, seriation needs to be limited to a single cultural tradition and restricted to a certain local area. Occurrence, frequency, and develop ment patterns can be obtained, depending on the nature of the units to be seriated and the interests of the investigator. One can only agree with Rouse that careful attention to all five aspects?units, traits, tradition, area, and pattern?is requisite to reliable chronological seriation. Although seriation by attention to the relative frequency of types is an effective way to establish a long-term develop mental chronology for a specific area, I do not agree completely with Rouse's statement that "types are the best kind of criterion to use in seriating surface collections or other deposition units" (1967:171). With such units, Rouse says that "one is dealing with completed artifacts, after</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 297 they have been used and deposited in the ground, rather than with the procedure of manufacture" (1967:171). With reasonably complex artifacts?for example, painted ceramics?it seems to me it is precisely the procedures of manufacturing with which we are concerned, if "man ufacture" is understood to include the decoration as well as the shaping and firing of the pottery. If we have available sufficiently complex data and are concerned to differentiate precisely between certain units, then the attention to particular modes, to use Rouse's term, is by far preferable to the use of types (Rowe 1959). I agree with Rouse (1967:179-180) that in seriation one studies changes in the criteria of archaeological units, but his conceptual scheme admits only modes, types, and phases as suitable criteria for judging chronological change. I would add trend-sensitive variables as a fourth kind of permissible temporal criterion, while agree ing fully with Rouse (1967:189) that supplemental chronological tech niques?for example, stratigraphy and dendrochronology?are essential to avoidance of circularity in reasoning. In 1970 Dunnell proposed that a seriation cannot be presumed to be a chronology unless three conditions are met: (a) All units included in a seriation must be of comparable duration; (b) all units must belong to the same cultural tradition; (c) all units must come from the same local area. These three conditions will be discussed in turn. It seems obvious that in all but the most trivial of circumstances it will be impossible to determine whether or not a given collection of artifacts was deposited in the same length of time as another given collection of artifacts. The question is more practically stated by Dunnell (1970:312) when he asserts that, for purposes of a given seriation, variation in the duration of the units "cannot be so great as to affect the distribution of the denotata of the classes used to create the ordering." Dunnell's (1970:313) solution is to remove the units that do not fit the ideal seriation model. This has two implications: (a) that acceptable chronological seriations may be carried out only on ideal data?that is, data for which, for a single "best" ordering, the denotata of the various criteria are continuous, in the case of incidence data, or are distributed unimodally, in the case of frequency or other abundance data; (b) that truly contemporaneous units cannot be tolerated in a seriation because their temporal positions would be ambiguous. Cowgill's (1972:385) requirement for the duration of ar chaeological units being seriated seems more practical: "For any two units whose chronological positions are claimed to be reliably or usefully distinguished, both [should] have durations that are at least not much greater than their time differences, and preferably durations that are considerably smaller than their time difference." It may be unrealistic to expect a precisely unimodal curve of any class</page><page sequence="42">298 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT of artifacts or attributes. What we wish to establish in a chronological seriation is the "best" general ordering of a set of units on the basis of time; if our criteria for ordering the units are primarily sensitive to time, we may expect some ambiguities in the ordering of the units for the reason that some of the units may be very close in time. A good seriation technique should be capable of indicating contemporaneity as well as differences in time between given units. For other discussions of criteria for a "good" seriation, see Cowgill (1972:383-387), Graham et al. (1976:1), and Kendall (1971a:237). Dunnell's second criterion for inferring that a seriation is a chronology is that seriated units belong to the same cultural tradition. For a given seriation, Dunnell (1970:313) proposes that the "set of classes employed to do the ordering be relevant to all the units." According to Dunnell, if more than a single tradition is represented in the data, more than one independent solution will obtain. The only remedy, according to Dunnell, is to remove the offending units and seriate them separately; the assump tion is that "the application of the seriation model will produce as many independent orders as there are traditions represented" (1970:313). In principle, I agree with Dunnell on this point, but it should be stressed that the recalcitrant units may well represent error variance (a mixed proveni ence, perhaps) or spatiofunctional variance rather than a separate tradi tion. Dunnell's third requirement for a chronological seriation is that the units to be seriated come from the same local area. He points out that the notion of "local area" is, at best, an ambiguous concept. Because varia tion in form can occur across space as well as through time, he asserts that, if the criteria used "are defined on the basis of attributes which show little variation in space and much variation in time, [then] the classes so created will have distributions that are primarily the result of change through time and not change through space" (Dunnell 1970:315; emphasis in original). He goes on to say that the effects of spatial variation can be minimized by carrying out several seriations of the same units using different classes of artifacts?for example, projectile point types, pottery types, scraper types, burial types, and house types (Dunnell 1970:316). As Rouse (1967:158-166, 194) observes, however, different kinds of criteria are appropriate to the seriation of different kinds of units. The likelihood of the availability of several classes of such units, each complex enough and abundant enough for adequate seriation, is very slight. Hole and Shaw (1967) experienced this difficulty in seriating their Near Eastern materials: Their pottery seriated well, but the chipped stone and other artifacts did not, primarily because of inadequate sample sizes for the nonceramic artifact classes (Cowgill 1968b:519). Carrying out multiple seriations is</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 299 one solution, but, in most cases, an impractical one. It would probably be an inefficient usage of time and financial resources for most ar chaeologists. In sum, Dunnell's reasoning is logically indisputable, but his sugges tions are applicable to ideal, not empirical, data. Confusion can result from failing to distinguish the mathematical seriation problem from the practical seriation problem in archaeology. Dunnell seems to be address ing the latter from the rigorous framework of the former. Archaeological seriation has two aspects: the mathematical problem and the archaeological interpretive problem. The archaeological interpre tive problem can easily be obfuscated by the mistaken notion that ideal models are directly applicable to real situations. A more profitable ap proach is the search for efficient techniques that will yield reliable results when applied to empirical data. Perhaps the most difficult part of our task is relating the ideal models and practical techniques to the systematic investigation of human be havior. Some progress has been made in this direction, using both empir ical and simulated data. For example, Dethlefsen and Deetz found that gravestone designs in eighteenth century New England did change ac cording to the patterns expected of type frequency data. Their research (Dethlefsen and Deetz 1966) revealed a gradual replacement of the "death's head" by the "cherub" motif, then a replacement of the latter by the "urn and willow" design. Although this pattern of replacement was widespread, they discovered differences in the time and rate of replace ment, as well as in patterns of motif overlap. In Boston and Cambridge, for example, death's head and cherub motifs had long periods of contem porary use. The cherub appears to have diffused outward from the Boston area roughly at the rate of 1 mile per year (Deetz and Dethlefsen 1965, 1971). They suggest that the Great Awakening of 1740-1760 may have had an effect on the replacement of the stern death's head with the angelic cherub figure. The durability of gravestones and the ease with which they can be dated make them valuable sources of information. Such well-controlled and documented studies bearing on the seriation problem are rare in archaeol ogy and should be encouraged whenever possible. Recently intensified interest on the part of archaeologists (e.g., Binford 1973:241-244; Long acre 1974; Rathje 1974) in ethnographic studies promises to shed addi tional light on the behavioral correlates of material culture. The work of David (1972) provides a valuable perspective on the use of frequencies of pottery types in archaeological inference. After a detailed study of pots from 15 women's quarters in the Fulani village of B?, David (1972:141) is convinced that ceramic representation in the archaeological</page><page sequence="44">300 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT record is generally a function of (a) the relative frequency of pot types at any given time, (b) the life span of pots, and (c) the duration of the level in which the assemblage is found. David's census of the ages of various pots in Fulani households reveals significant contrasts in their longevity. For example (David 1972:141, Table 1), the median age for bowls and small and medium cooking pots is between 2 and 3 years, while the median age for large cooking and storage vessels is three to four times this age. In similar observations of pottery function and longevity among the Conibo of Peru, DeBoer (1974) reports considerably shorter ceramic life spans. He provides an interesting discussion of the possible uses, and limita tions, of ceramic longevity data for the estimation of population and village duration. The studies of David (1972) and DeBoer (1974) may be compared with Foster's (1960) estimates of pottery life span in four households in Tzintzuntzan, Mexico. Foster (1960:608) hypothesizes that life spans of pottery depend on (a) basic strength of the pottery, (b) functions of the pottery, (c) the mode of use, particularly whether cooking is done on a stove or on the ground, (d) causes of breakage (carelessness, presence of children or domestic animals), and (e) pottery costs. Stimulated by the work of David and Hennig (1972), Hatch (1976) and his colleagues have simulated by computer the manufacture, breakage, and accumulation of potsherds. Studies of this nature, based on actual ethnographic observations, can provide insight into the formation of the archaeological record. Efforts (e.g., Schiffer 1976) to formulate explicit models for the description and explanation of archaeologically observable behavioral processes also are to be welcomed. Such models provide a framework for profitable communication among archaeologists who rec ognize the importance of investigating the relationships between the ar chaeological record and the cultural and natural processes that produce it. In sum, study of well-documented archaeological cases, ethnographic observations of the formation of the archaeological record, and ex perimentation with simulated archaeological data are all important to the evaluation of archaeological seriation and its improvement or replace ment, should it be found wanting. Some alternatives, in fact, have been suggested. As a supplement to type frequency seriation, "arrangement" has been proposed by Schiffer (1975:257) for the chronological ordering of sites having "intermittent and varying durations of occupation"?that is, sites that might violate Dun nell's first criterion, discussed above. Archaeologists have generally solved the "comparable duration of units" problem by augmenting with supplementary evidence (stratigraphie, usually) seriations obtained by ordering units of presumed short temporal duration. Schiffer (1975:258) assumes that, within the same cultural tradition in the same local area, there is a true chronological ordering of artifact types. In one version of</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 301 "arrangement," the relative dates of initial occupation and final aban donment of sites are inferred directly from the appearance and disappear ance of certain artifact types; the true sequence of types is assumed to be already known through the application of conventional type frequency seriation. As Schiffer notes, the technique would not properly arrange intermittently occupied sites. The second version of "arrangement" also begins at the point when an agreeable seriation has been produced. Type frequencies are plotted against a scale of "relative time," and an algebraic equation for each type is fitted to each frequency curve as if the units of relative time were equivalent in duration (Schiffer 1975:259). The total amounts of all types that would be deposited over continuous or discon tinuous intervals are estimated by substituting type frequency data into algebraic functions obtained by Riemann integration of the linear functions derived earlier. Finally, the predicted artifact counts are com pared with actual artifact counts from multicomponent sites by means of the Pearson correlation, high positive values of Pearson's r indicating, Schiffer hypothesizes, probable times of site occupation. Schiffer's use of integral calculus on relative frequency data for which the equivalence of time units cannot be demonstrated would probably be considered prepos terous by a serious mathematician, but his technique is nonetheless intui tively appealing. I am skeptical that "arrangement," as articulated by Schiffer, would be any more systematic or provide more reliable results than the traditional process of seriating multiple provenience units and using stratigraphie or other supplementary information to confirm se quences. His proposed experiments on both simulated and empirical data (1975:260-262) will provide further basis on which to judge the tech nique's efficacy. Another approach to seriation epistemology has been taken by Kintigh (1973, 1974) in the context of the application to archaeological inference of techniques developed in artificial intelligence research. Inspired by the successes of the DENDRAL program (Buchanan et al. 1971) in the generation of hypotheses about complex organic molecules, given mass spectrometer data, Kintigh has begun work on a LISP program that will select likely archaeological hypotheses based on its own archaeological "knowledge," test these propositions, and use the result to generate and test additional hypotheses. Doran (1972:434-449) has also argued, follow ing Amarel (1971), that automatic hypothesis generation can be valuable in archaeology because its hallmarks?(a) appropriate representation, (b) evaluation procedures, and (c) search strategies?are all important to the generation of archaeological knowledge. In sum, contributions to seriation epistemology have taken the form of (a) studying the relationship of the ideal seriation model to real situations; (b) exploring the relationship of seriation to the formation of the ar</page><page sequence="46">302 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT chaeological record (in well-controlled archaeological contexts, in living societies, and in simulated situations), and (c) studying the process of archaeological inference itself. It should be stressed again that seriation is a descriptive analytic tech nique for arranging units along a single dimension. In archaeology it has been used to suggest chronological orderings of archaeological units, and it has generally been successful at this task. Although I have quibbled (Marquardt 1974b: 188-198) with some of his statements, I am in agree ment with Plog (1973:189) that "chronologies cause us to think of time as a series of successive units rather than as a continuous flow." If we do think in this way, then it is not surprising that seriation plays virtually an axiomatic role in archaeological inference. Plog suggests we might realize seriation's potential as a diachronic tool by generating "a data base from which we would work in attempting to explain variability in the way that human populations adopt innovations" (1973:191-192). Some earlier anthropological works, notably those of Barnett (1953), approached the explanation of culture change with con cepts centering on the individual's acceptance of innovations, and ar chaeologists have offered explanations for the distribution of various pottery types, manufacturing techniques, and design details in which both temporal and spatial considerations were important. As one example of the latter sort of study, Menzel et al. (1964) hypothesized phases of diversity and unity in stylistic features within the lea Valley, suggesting that stylistic changes were often influenced by neighboring developments. Ethnographic observations, such as those of DeBoer, discussed above, have shown that type frequencies in the archaeological record may bear little resemblance to frequencies of certain items in use by a human group at one given time. This sort of information may help us to choose our variables or types more effectively, but it does not invalidate the seriation technique itself (Springer 1977 has recently made a similar argument). I agree with Cowgill (1972:386) that obtaining a chronological ordering will often require only a small fraction of the available data. Used in isolation, seriation is surely an inadequate technique for investigating cultural pro cess or, for that matter, for reconstructing culture history. Used in con cert with other techniques in a well-advised research strategy, it will continue to be an important archaeological tool. THE PRACTICE OF SERIATION As with any analytical technique, seriation must be employed judi ciously. Strategies and techniques used in the field must be coordinated with</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERIATION 303 the research questions being asked and must be appropriate to the nature of the archaeological record in the region being investigated. Steps must be taken to be sure that surface collections are representative samples, that excavations are carefully carried out, that proveniences are unmixed: These are, of course, advisable whether or not seriation is to be em ployed. Although many computer-assisted techniques are available, ar chaeologists should not hesitate to sort by hand if the number of units is relatively small. The methods of Gelfand (1971a,b), for example, are unambiguous and efficient for problems on the order of 10 units. Even if the number of units is large, samples drawn from these units can be seriated individually; at the least, this procedure can suggest hypotheses for further testing, and may help guide the choice of additional sites or areas for investigation when time in the field is limited. It goes without saying that a computer can be of invaluable assistance in the efficient processing of large data sets. Programs are easily obtained for many of the computer-assisted techniques mentioned in this paper?for example, SE RIATE (Craytor and Johnson 1968), AXIS and POLISH (Wilkinson 1974), Small Space Analysis (Lingoes 1973), TORSCA (Young 1968), and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (Nie et al. 1975). Factor analytic programs and multidimensional scaling programs, such as MDSCAL (Shepard 1962a,b; Kruskal 1964a,b), are available at many computing facilities. If archaeologists want to use techniques for which programs are not readily available, the assistance of a computer pro grammer will be needed. A competent programmer can produce a work ing program in a matter of a few hours or a few days, depending on the complexity of the algorithm. The budgeting of wages for a computer programmer may be a wise investment, particularly for large-scale or long-term projects in which substantial amounts of data are processed, or in which the time available for report preparation is limited. Although they have their limitations, incidence data can be useful in seriation. This kind of information is most reliable when the units repre sent "closed finds," such as graves. Because it is the incidence of certain criteria that we are recording for each unit, rather than an absolute number or relative proportion, it is especially important that mixing of materials between units be minimized. Various forms of abundance data have been used. Again, although seriation according to the frequency of types has inherent limitations, it has produced and can continue to produce reasonable results. Types must be chosen carefully, however. Descriptive statistical analyses can help suggest or confirm reliable types (Spaulding 1953). If the results of type frequency seriations are ambiguous, one should re-evaluate the criteria</page><page sequence="48">304 WILLIAM H. MARQUARDT used for classification and the methods used to collect the samples being seriated. Steps must be taken to maximize spatiotemporal variance and minimize spatiofunctional variance if the objective is a chronological seriation. Supplementary information should be sought in order to pro vide independent confirmation or disconfirmation of sequences. If sufficiently complex data are available, logically independent trend sensitive variables are preferable to type frequencies for chronological investigation. Use of independent ratio-scale variables avoids the closed array effect caused by the use of percentages or relative proportions. The productive debates of the past 10 years stimulated a re-evaluation of some of archaeology's oldest and most reliable tools, including seria tion. As Watson has stated: There is undeniable potential for immensely increased information from our data if we explore these new theoretical and methodological questions, while applying new and better methods to old questions like the explanation of culture change. The prehisto rian as philosopher of science emerged in the 1960's; the 1970's should be devoted to the operationalizing of theory by the nomothetically-oriented prehistorian as excavator of the past [1973:51]. Further advances in seriation theory, epistemology, and techniques may be anticipated in the future. Whether individuals perceive their efforts to be idiographic or nomothetic, primarily humanistic or primarily scientific, the establishment of reliable chronologies will always be important in archaeology.
