<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Scientists7 Bookshelf Science Books for Young Readers Speaking for the Animals They eat, play, fight, suffer, run, sleep, live, die. They have "personality." In the empathetic world of childhood, ani? mals easily represent heroes or villains, parents or siblings, lords or pawns. Au? thors of children's books depend on em? pathy, and many turn (nonhuman) ani? mals into human surrogates for literary purposes. Pick up three children's books and you will likely find at least one ani? mal that has, following in the footsteps of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle or Aesop's tortoise and hare, surrendered its species identity for a more civilized existence. The empathetic draw of animals has not escaped authors and publishers of books that attempt to help children learn about nature. Children go for animal titles. Con? sider the scene in Jane Hoeppner's third grade class when I dropped by with a box of 17 recent books sent by American Scien? tist. Books about wolves, snakes and pen? guins found many fans; more abstract (and often more thoughtful) titles garnered only one or two lonely advocates. Left alone on the shelf, avoided by all, was a book by Jerome Wexler called Sundew Stranglers: Plants That Eat Insects (Dutton Children's Books, $15.95). I was surprised. "I don't like plants," explained one stu? dent, drawing nods from her friends. "Eat? ing insects is gross," said another. It ap? pears empathy can be taxon-specific. I am intrigued by how nature can be translated to children and how much we can know about other species. I have ap? proached these questions academically, but they are also personal. As a boy, I nat? urally assumed animals experienced the same sort of thoughts and feelings I did. When a kid down the street chucked a box turtle into the air just to watch the tur? tle's shell split open, I imagined that the turtle probably had a friend turtle some? where nearby, mourning the death and hating the kid. I was projecting, I know, but that is the essence of empathy in chil? dren, and it is not all that different for adults. The task of presenting what ani? mals actually are is both enabled and complicated by our ability to empathize. In the box of books was a work that ap? proached this challenge with a life-history approach, achieving empathy through the story of one animal's life in the grand style of Jean Craighead George and others. Hunter in the Snow: The Lynx, by Susan Bonners, (Little, Brown &amp; Co., $14.95) be? gins with a Canada lynx on the hunt. The text is surprisingly fast-paced, considering the amount of ecological information giv? en along the way You learn how the lynx's large feet help her run on snow; that she perches on downed trees to help see her prey; that the snowshoe hare, her favorite food, can most likely be found eating the new shoots sprouting up from a forest that had been destroyed by fire. The first hare escapes, but the second does not. You see the dead rabbit and blood on the snow. The pace slows after the hunt but picks up again as the informative narrative follows the lynx as she grows, mates and raises off? spring on her own. Susan Bonners's writing is ecologically substantive. Her rich, detailed illustrations are dreamy, like a walk through a snowy pine forest. The children liked this book, and so did I. The lynx is an active female character, which I find particularly important in light of a study a student of mine recently con? ducted on animal preferences among fifth grade children. Children were asked to choose their favorite animal. Most girls chose a domesticated animal; most boys chose wild. Many girls preferred juvenile stages, choosing puppies rather than dogs, for example. Most girls based their prefer? ence on appearance. ("I like kittens because they are cute and soft.") Most boys picked animals based on ability. ("I like bears be? cause they are strong and can kill things.") Many animal stories for children carry im? plicit gender messages (note The Lion King). Parents may want to be aware of their pow? er to reinforce or undermine stereotypes. In another ambitious book an author approaches empathy by describing the life of an Adelie penguin in the first person, through the penguin's eyes. Spencer Lloyd Davis's descriptions of life on the Antarctic ice in Penguin: A Season in the Life of an Adelie Penguin (Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., $18.95) are often moving. The story fol? lows the penguin as he withstands storms, builds a rock nest, mates, guards his chicks and finally loses his mate to the predacious leopard seal. There is much penguin biolo? gy here, and Da vis's love of the stark land? scape is obvious. Yet Davis, himself a scientist, poses a confounding question in his book. Au? thors often translate nature through the lens of science, but is science adequate to the task? As an ecologist, I have asked myself this same question. I first started writing children's books when I returned from research trips and found I could not begin to express all I needed to in science articles, where observations and ideas, not emotion, are the native currency. Too much remained unsaid. Many scientists are closet artists, musicians or poets for much the same reason. In many ways, though, I admire sound science writing for what it is, and I feel Davis takes his criticism too far. In his preface, he tells children: "Science... pre? sumes to unmask the truth, but then pro? ceeds to screen that truth from the public (which funds it) behind a barrier of con? voluted theory, unnecessary jargon, and a mess of probability values." I disagree with his implied conspiracy. Scientists have not plotted to make their professional writing as esoteric as possi? ble. Rather, like children marooned on an uninhabited island, they have gradually constructed dialects that suit their needs. Scientific discourse could use an overhaul, but I don't expect theories to become sig? nificantly less convoluted until nature be? comes less complex. Ultimately, despite Davis's good inten? tions, his penguin has a problem with sci? entific discourse. I could not put faith in this chimeric narrator, who sounded sometimes like a penguin and sometimes like a scien? tist. The penguin describes the land in hu? man terms (he calls it Antarctica), reflects on processes of glaciation and social biolo? gy and even reads the names of human Antarctic explorers off their graves, calling them heroes. The relationship between the penguin and his mate turns from romance to reproductive biology when, at the climax of an animated penguin sex scene, the pen? guin protagonist thinks, "The products of some seventy million summers of evolution pass between us in less than a heartbeat." The third-graders (who did not have time 558 American Scientist, Volume 83</page><page sequence="2">Susan Bonners portrays an early winter hunt in which a female lynx and her growing kittens fan out and take zigzag paths about 30 paces apart to capture a snowshoe hare. From Hunter in the Snow: The Lynx. to read the long text) liked this book for its photographs, which are fascmating and beautifully depict the penguin's life. A surprisingly underused way to por? tray animals is through the eyes of chil? dren. Susan Goodman's Bats, Bugs, and Biodiversity (Atheneum Books for Young Readers, $16) follows the adventures of seventh- and eighth-graders through a Pe? ruvian rain forest. Goodman has a gift for listening to cMdren, and she includes their voices (through journal entries) in this movingly honest account of what was clearly a transformational experience for the children. "There I was complaining about ak&lt;onditioning and I see a little kid sleeping in a house without walls," says Rebecca. Writes Maggie: "I counted my bites and I ended up with 103 on my whole body and 55 on my left leg alone. Pretty gross." The young travelers en? counter a baby sloth being sold for food in the market and decide to buy the sloth and return it to the forest. Later they must face the consequences of their good deed, which supported the sale of wild animals and likely did not save the sloth, probably too young to survive in the forest alone. "The kids wondered if there even was a right answer." The only dishonest aspect of this book I could detect is the cover, which pictures a charismatic toucan with a scenic rain forest beyond. The toucan was lifted from a photograph on page 20, rotat? ed and superimposed on a different back? ground, an unfortunate decision that had me checking all the photos to see if they too had been doctored. Overall, though, this is a wonderful book, and the student reviewers liked reading about other kids. Of course many books rely on facts rather than narrative to provide an under? standing of animals, and there are some impressive experiments of this sort among recent works. Susan Markle, in Outside and Inside Snakes (Macmillan Books for Young Readers, $16), adopts the perspective of an organismal biologist. Her gift for relating to children is obvious in her treatment of snake locomotion, metabolism, scales, skin, skeleton, muscles, sensory systems, Firsthand learning in the Peruvian Amazon rain forest. From Bats, Bugs, and Biodiversity. venom, respiration, digestion and repro? duction, all of which is accompanied by enlightening stock photographs. Jane Hoeppner's students Hked the accessibility and liveliness of Markle's descriptions. But the best thing about Markle's text is that it asks kids to think, a surprisingly rare quality in science books. "Do you wonder why a snake's skeleton has so many backbones?" "Why do you think this snake is sticking out its tongue?" A "Looking Back" section challenges kids to recall and synthesize what they have learned. In the end, empathy is achieved not through traditional storytelling, but through engaging details that inspire chil? dren to wonder about what being a snake might be like. In the words of one student reviewer, "This book is cool." Another book that adopts a straightfor? ward, factual approach, but in this case with an ecological context, is In the Air and Everywhere, by Jody Marshall (Scientific American Books for Young Readers, $15.95). This book depicts birds in various habitats and was one of the top titles among the student reviewers, partially be? cause it is a pop-up book. An impressive amount of information on bird basics (with an important summary of bird iden? tification), birds of the sea, the desert, open spaces, marsh and woodland, is squeezed into this 12-page book. The realistic illus? trations are aclmirably species-specific, the text informative. Silhouettes, common names and specific details on the birds are conveniently provided in the pull-outs that accompany each double-page spread. One book in which animals played only a passing role also drew attention from the 1995 November-December 559</page><page sequence="3">Student reviewers. The Rajah's Rice: A Mathematical Folktale from India, adapted by David Barry (Scientific American Books for Young Readers, $15.95), tells the tale of Chandra, a mathematically inclined girl who cures the Rajah's elephants of ear? aches. When asked to choose her reward, Chandra thinks of the poor villagers and turns to the Rajah's chessboard. "If Your Majesty pleases, place two grains of rice on the first square of this chessboard. Place four grains on the second square, eight on the next, and so on, doubling each pile of rice till the last square." The Rajah readily agrees to this believable con and, some eighteen zillion rice grains later, is forced to return the land to the people and live a more humble life. The Rajahs Rice is a wel? come addition to the sparse genre of math? ematical stories. I finished with the books and with Jane Hoeppner's third-grade class inspired by the children's obvious love of animals and by the variety and caliber of books they could choose from to further their understanding. I was also encouraged by the obvious care and respect that many authors gave to their subjects. Although I remain convinced that text and art are too limited to capture the essence of any ani? mal, my experience has been that good books never end on the written page. Books help children gain knowledge, po? etry and meaning. And they need only go outside to hear the animals speak for themselves.?Chris Myers Providing Context: Education by Way of a Story The arrival of the book box from Amer? ican Scientist was cause for great ex? citement in our house. We read through all the books several times with Carrie, our four- (almost five-) year-old, and then let her choose the ones that interested her the most. Her choices surprised us a bit. A book on sharks was overlooked, as well as one with beautiful photographs of sea slugs. Carrie spends much time in the ocean and has started to grow gills her? self, so we expected the sea creature books to be favorites. It soon became ob? vious, however, that her choices were based on whether the book told a story or simply related facts about the crea? tures. At age four, she prefers to be edu? cated by way of a story. The overwhelming favorite (of young and old) was Baru Bay, Australia (Hyperion Books for Children, $19.95), a book and cassette tape set about a young girl's ex? ploration of a tropical bay and adjacent rain forest in Australia by Bob Weir and Wendy Weir. For Carrie, the book provid? ed a combination of the familiar (reef and ocean creatures) and the unusual and ex? otic (crocodiles, native Australian animals and birds). She was fascinated by the Abo? riginal concept of Dreamtime in which the spirits and bodies of the ancestors became the animals and the natural landforrrts, re? spectively, of a region. The story of Baru Man, who became the crocodile, prompted her to choose which animal she would have become (the goanna). She was so in? terested in this version of the origin of the world that we pulled out one of our own books about the Dreamtime to read more. The illustrations are brightly colored, detailed and accurate. Each is framed by a narrow decorative border drawn in a style reminiscent of Aboriginal art. A key to all the animals in each picture is pre? sented at the back of the book along with a glossary. The inclusion of a cassette tape really makes this book come alive. On one side Bob Weir reads the story against a background of Aboriginal music, ani? mal calls, and rain-forest and ocean sounds. Weir's voice is not overly expres? sive but has the perfect intonation for a In an unusual mixture of scientific cross-section and representational art, Wendy Weir shows the rich diversity of life and the benefits of cooperation above and below the water line. From Baru Bay, Australia. quiet-time story. The second side of the tape is Aboriginal music (with Weir on guitar). Of all the books we read, Baru Bay did the best job of capturing Carrie's imagination as well as teaching her about nature and man's interactions with it. Swimmer, by Shelley Gill and Shannon Cartwright (Paws IV Publishing, $8.95), is about a Chinook salmon (named Swim mer) who hatches in a tributary of the Yukon River, travels downstream out to sea and, finally, returns to her birthplace to lay eggs and then die. A secondary theme of the book is the importance of salmon in the diet of native peoples and animals. Carrie enjoyed this story; she was already farniliar with the life cycle of salmon, but the details given, such as 560 American Scientist, Volume 83</page><page sequence="4">Irmgard Luchts first view of the fiery red of a poppy through the lenses of her binocular microscope inspired her vivid portrait. From The Red Poppy. what salmon eat and who eats salmon, made the story exciting for her. A quote from the book summarizes it: "Eat and avoid being eaten. That was Swimmer's life." Carrie was worried about Swim? mer's survival, and sad at her demise, but she handled it stoically when rerninded how much fresh fish our household con? sumes! The book's illustrations are lovely, with strips along one or more borders that provide additional information, such as labeled drawings of fish mentioned in the text and details of different types of fish nets. There are also bits of text, out? side the story line, on each page that pro? vide supplemental scientific information about salmon. We found reading all of these notes interrupted the story too much for Carrie, but an older child would find them interesting. Continuing on the predator-prey theme, When Hunger Calls (Candlewick Press, $15.95), by Bert Kitchen, presents 12 predators and their sometimes bizarre methods of capturing and consuming prey. Carrie was particularly impressed by the cleverness of the angler fish, which dangles a lure out in front of its mouth to attract its prey. Beautifully detailed paint? ings of each predator-prey couple accom? pany concise descriptions of the predato? ry methods. The text presents just the right amount of information for a four-to five-year-old, and although the vocabu? lary was sometimes above her level, Car? rie seemed to grasp the ideas. Questions about particular words didn't arise until the third or fourth reading. Although this book departs somewhat from Carrie's taste for storybooks, the manner of pre? sentation makes each page essentially a story in itself. Her favorite predator-prey combination changes with each reading, an indication that she learns a little more each time. When Hunger Calls is a close second to Baru Bay in her opinion. Lavishly detailed illustrations are the first thing to strike you about The Red Pop? py, by Irmgard Lucht (Hyperion Books for Children, $13.95), which follows the life cy? cle of this wildflower at the edge of a rye field. The poppies and other plants in the paintings are faithrully, and beautifully, re? produced in microscopic detail. Lucht in? cludes fauna (mostly insects) in her pic? tures, and additional information about the habits of these animals is given in the end notes. Although we could have spent many happy hours simply examining the pictures, we also enjoyed the text. The sim? ple prose has a gentle, poetic quality and leads the reader step by step through the reproductive stages of the flower. Anatom? ically correct terminology is defined but not in an encyclopedic fashion. Like most children, Carrie loves cheese, pizza and finding out how things are made. The book Extra Cheese, Please! Moz zarella's Journey from Cow to Pizza, by Cris Peterson and Alvis Upitis (Boyds Mills Press, $14.95), brought these elements to? gether in a unified story. Milk from Annabelle the cow is tracked from pro? duction (what and how much Annabelle eats), to quality checks and transport to the cheese factory, and then through the various steps of cheese manufacture. Bright, sharp photographs document each step of the process, and the text is written in a simple, child-friendly manner. As scientists, we appreciated the fact that the books we read (with the excep? tion of Extra Cheese, Please!, only because of its different subject matter) all did a good job of portraying nature in a nonro manticized manner. When Hunger Calls is frankly realistic, and The Red Poppy verges on being a textbook of flower reproduc? tion (albeit a beautiful, poetic one). De? spite the anthropomorphism of Swimmer, the reader gains a realistic sense of the life of a salmon. Baru Bay may be criticized for the unbelievable diversity in both the reef and rain forest, but flora and fauna are described and illustrated with accu? racy. Baru Bay also takes the appreciation of nature one step farther by incorporat? ing the Aboriginal version of creation. Al? though we are firm proponents of evolu? tion, we think that exposure to a variety of beliefs fosters our daughter's imagina? tion and understanding of our world.?

The Particle Garden: Our Universe as Understood by Particle Physicists. Gordon Kane. Addison-Wesley, 1995. $22.76. (18+) Comprehensive, easy to understand and a good read: three qualities that most science-related books cannot claim, but that describe this one perfect? ly. The author relates that he is "... ex? plaining in words what we've learned about the universe. I hope... to help more people to see the patterns that cre? ate nature, including all of us." He is true to his word. Kane begins the book with a fascinat? ing introduction to the history of particle physics. He then follows with other in? teresting passages on, among other things, the standard theory, She Higgs boson and the uses of particle accelera? tors. Several drawings and animations as well as a complete glossary and appen? dixes further aid the reader to under? stand every "element" of this book.

Jeanne K. Hanson and Danny O'Leary. W. H. Freeman and Co., 1994. $14.95 cloth, $8.95 paper. (8-12) This book got my attention by the pic? tures on the cover of feet, teeth, people and emotions. The book has a great lay? out with interesting pictures with writ? ing of how and why something happens on each page. Some of the subjects in the book are on blinking, coughing, day? dreaming, goose bumps and more! I've always wondered why you hiccup and once I found out, I was so interested in the book I wanted to read more! This is the perfect book to find out why or how something you did happened.?Mia Cox, 12,6th, St. Francis School, Goshen, KY I really like this book because it tells how our body works! Like how we cry, smile, vomit, etc. The author's choice of words were hard for a fifth grader.... But after I read some of the sections, I really got hooked. My favorite one was "Ice Cream Headaches," because the picture was really good. I never knew that when you have those horrible headaches your carotid arteries expand to carry extra blood. When they expand, they press against eveiytl?ng else in your forehead. That's what hurts. If a parent, teacher or friend was curi? ous about these various bodily func? tions, I would tell them to read this book.?David Taustine, 12,5th, St Francis Cell Wars. Fran Balkwill.

Exploring Light, Color, and Vision. Patricia Lauber. Crown Publishing Group, 1994. $17. (8-12) What Do You See and How Do You See It? was a very educational and interest? ing book that could be read and under? stood by children age 11 and up. Not only would children like this scientific book, but even some adults might like it. The importance of light to sight is what the book is mostly about. It contains talk about how eyes work, how light moves and reflects and the colors you see. I would recommend this book to my family and friends because I learned a lot from each page. Each was detailed and descriptive with photographs and pictures. I suggest you read this wonder? ful book.?Kate Liter, 11,5th, St. Francis A Caribou Journey. Debbie S.

This book is written in great detail that kids can read easily, and the pictures are fantastic. The book is mainly about the caribou's circle of life. I learned how newborns grow up and that they eat lichen during the winter. I also learned about the enemies of a cari? bou, such as the golden eagle and wolf. The information in this book is very clearly written and well explained. I would not change anything in this book. If a parent, teacher, student or friend needed any information about caribou, I would recommend this book.?Jon Wit ten, 11,5th, St Francis Whose Tracks Are These?

Danielle Weisberg, 11,5th, St Francis Killer Bees. Bianca Lavies. Dutton Chil? dren's Books, 1994. $15.99. (?-12) Killer Bees is an easy-to-read book by Bianca Lavies ... and the author gives so much detail it feels like I'm in the swarm of bees with Bianca. It has colorful pic? tures that go along with the words. It tells how the beekeepers calm the bees so they can get the honey and sell it. This book would interest people who aren't already interested in bees.?Kristin Fred? erick, 12,5th, St Francis The picture that is most interesting is the cover. It is of a colony of bees, but since it is enlarged the bees are about an inch long.... By reading this book you can learn about a killer bee's life, nest, vi? olent behavior and effect on the envi? ronment. This photo essay will help kids understand bees.? Maggie Bennett, 12, 6th, St Francis Jungle: Discover Life in the Tropical Rain Forest. Theresa Greenaway. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1994. $16. (8+) The first time I saw this book I knew I would like it because I like jungle ani? mals. My favorite section of the book is the section called "Hunters and Killers." It answered all of my ques? tions, from where they come from to how big they get. I looked forward to the next page all the time. This is a great book because the author uses a good choice of words that even a third grader could read and enjoy. The pictures of the reptiles were my favorite.... I rec? ommend this book to anyone above the age of seven. The only thing I would change about the book would be to add more snakes. This book was great from the beginning to the end.?Aaron Tas man, U, 5th, St Francis Aquarium Book. George Ancona. Clari? on Books, 1994. $ 6.95. (8-11) This book... talks about undersea life and its habitat. Some of the animals I didn't even know; for example, the yel? low headed jawfish, unicorn tang (fish), hippo tang (fish) and lipstick tang (fish). What I like the most is the pictures [be? cause they] show a lot of detail. The book also shows animals that live around the water. The book shows a place where they take care of undersea animals that have been hurt.?Carrie Smith, 10,5th, St Francis I admire the author's captions, his well-organized thoughts, his choice of words and his ability to write a book in? teresting to kids of any age.?Joseph Stro bel, 12,5th, St Francis Stephen Biesty's Cross-Sections: Castle. Stephen Biesty. Dorling Kindersley, 1994. $16.95 (6-12) The book... got my attention because of its cover picture, which shows some of the many things people used to do in the Middle Ages. When you flip through the pages, you find they are colorful, well drawn and descriptive. This books tells about the construction of castles, the du? ties of the workers, positions of attack and much, much more. The ideas presented were clear and informative.

Joan D'Amico and Karen E. Drurnmond. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995. $12.95. (12+) From the start, it appears to be a fun filled book with much to say ... it effec? tively reaches the younger crowd while pointing out facts that all adults should know. D'Amico and IDrurnmond have teamed up to make a successful book that tries effectively to teach the reader about the science that is behind cooking, and how we experience biology, chemistry and nutrition at its best in everyday life. There are so many little extra pieces in the book that combine to make a very satisfactory, although sometimes over? whelming, teaching material. Its rating system is a creative method to assess the recipes, and the introductory sections are extremely detailed in describing tools used in the kitchen and safety tips. The book is (especially) something that should be used by parents and their kids together.... The illustrations, so likable on the covers, aren't prevalent inside the book?more illustrations like the ones there already would probably enhance the text.... The authors treat the reader well, [however,] and write intelligently yet helpfully. Recipes in the book are unique and (we hope) a treat to eat as well as read about! All in all, The Science Chef is a delight for all ages, and is something that should be a staple of any household with the drive to learn and the love of food.?Car? olyn Chu, 17, llth,NCSSM The first thing I thought about when I ripped through The Science Chef for the first time was how much my little broth? er would enjoy it. With its bright pic tures and easy step-by-step instructions, it reminded me at first of any other good children's cookbook. But upon closer ex? amination, I found it to be much more than I expected! The introductions to each chapter are what really sold it to me ... I especially enjoyed the food pyramid and the nutritional guide located in the back of the book. They are so fascinating; I found myself wishing that I had owned this book when I was still in elementary school. I would recommend [it] to any? one who has curious children. It has sci? ence, nutrition, food and fun?all wrapped up into one!?Elizabeth Smith, 15,10th, Leesville Road HS, Raleigh, NC, TIP Program The Grizzly Bear Family Book. Michio Hoshino. North-South Books Inc., 1994. $16.95. (6-10) One thing I really liked was how the author had actually experienced what he wrote about. The author had really been to Alaska for a year photographing the grizzlies and writing about what he saw. The book was like his journal. It was more like a story than an educational book. I hardly realized I was learning about grizzlies, because of the way the author wrote the story.... For instance, I learned that grizzlies eat ground squir? rels in the winter, and sometimes they will eat 200,000 berries a day [in the summer].... Even if you don't really like grizzly bears you will like this book.? Allison White, 10,5th, St. Francis My favorite picture is the cover be? cause it has the bears lined up from tallest to shortest.... The author's words were very clear and it made you feel like you were really there, with the bear.?Jill Petro, 12,5th, St. Francis Planet Ocean: A Story of Life, the Sea, and Dancing to the Fossil Record. Brad Matsen and Ray Troll. Ten Speed Press, 1994. $29.95. (12+) I chose this book because I noticed the intriguing pictures. As I opened the book and started to read, I felt as though I was a part of the ocean. The pictures were so realistic and the words so de? scriptive that I wanted to read on and on. However, I did think that kids younger than 10 would have a little diffi? culty reading some of the information. Did you know that the way fish breathe is through gills? The gills are lo? cated behind the fins. The gills breathe oxygen from the water. Whales breathe with their blow holes, located on their head. Whales get their air by swirruning up to the surface and taking in the air. I have learned a lot and suggest you read it and learn a lot too.?Gretta Hust, 11, 5th, St. Francis Weird Things You Can Grow. Janet Goldenberg. Random House, Inc., 1994. $12. (8+) Weird Things You Can Grow ... is an unusual book that tells about exotic plants and how to grow them. The au? thor uses a cartoon format with brightly colored illustrations. The vocabulary is perfect for ages 9 to 12. It is ... fascinat? ing to learn about strange plants such as the two-leaved plant called the "Living Stone," which some scientists mistake for a rock. Altogether this book describes 33 peculiar plants and teaches you their Latin names.... It even lists the names of the companies from which you can buy the seeds to grow these plants.?Becca Bryant, 11,5th, St. Francis 564 American Scientist, Volume 83</page><page sequence="8">This book got my attention with the word "Weird" written like that on the cover. I like weird things like plants that move when you touch them, Venus fly traps and plants you can make paper with. One thing I liked about this book was that all the instructions on how to grow the plants were in comic form. They all had pictures and were eye catching. This book would be good for people of all ages. It has jokes in the comics and strange but really cool plants that would be great for a research pro? ject. I think that anyone who reads this book will find it funny, intriguing, infor? mative and altogether fun!?Em?y T?te, 12,6th, St Francis 100 Amazing Make-It-Yourself Science Fair Projects. Glen Vecchione. Sterling PubUshing Co., Inc., 1994: $17.95. (14+) At first, I didn't trunk that this book would be so good. I thought it would be just a listing of science-fair projects. But when I read the section of "Eye and Mind Tricks," I was amazed. It had a whole page on one project on moving cloud forms. First it listed the supplies you would need to build that project. Then it explained how to build it. The ideas were clear, and the explanations of the instruc? tions that were complicated helped me to understand better. When I had a question, I just read on and it was answered. The book gave pictures that would help the person building the project get a picture in his mind of what it would look like. I recommend this book to people who are stuck without an idea for a science-fair project.?Megan Lasley, 10,5th, St Francis City of the Gods: Mexico's Ancient City of Teotihuacan. Caroline Arnold. Clari? on Books, 1994. $14.95. (8-11) When I first looked at the book, the ti? tle interested me, so I started to pay some attention to the picture on the front of the book. The pyramids, plat? forms and buildings made me want to ^ open the book and read about the lifestyles of the people in the cities. When I opened the book and ^^^H flipped through the pages, I no- ^^^^H ticed that the pictures were out- ^^^^H standing, and it seemed like I ^^^^^t was actually there in that time ^^^^^H in the City of the Gods. As I ^^^^^M started reading, I noticed that the text was clear and interest- ^^^^^H ing. I found myself not wanting ^^^^^H to put down the book. The au- ^^^^H thor's choice of words did not ^^^^H seem tough or hard to under- ^^^H stand. But the names of different cities were hard to pronounce in my head, especially the city of Teotihua- ^ can. I think children 8 to 12 should read this book... I really liked the City of the Gods.?Genni Perkins, 10,5th, St. Francis Archeology: Discover the Extraordinary World of Archeology. Jane Mclntosh. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1994. $16. (8+) Flipping through this book is like looking through time. This book can be scratched on the surface or deeply read. The pictures are bright and eye catching. Once you pick this book up you will find yourself being whisked away into the magical history of our world. Anyone doing research on history or archeology should read this book.?-Clinton Kendler, 11,6th, St. Francis From my first impression of the cover I thought this book would just be about old artifacts. But it wasn't. My favorite part in the book would probably be the swords and the top of the spears. The pots were very well made, even though they looked hard to make. One model of a small city in the book was very detailed. Plus there was a real house made with mud, wood and hay with a little string that helped the roof stay up. On one page you could see lots of very good models of boats and some cannon balls and a cannon. I would recommend this book to a friend.... ?Daniel Abboud, 11,5th, St. Francis Lucky Science: Accidental Discoveries from Gravity. Royston M. and Jeanie Roberts. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995. $10.95. (12+) I liked the book... [because] it an? swered many questions about how great discoveries were made.... My favorite story in the book is the one about the sil? ly putty... [that] was discovered by acci? dent during World War IE when scien? tists were trying to invent a better tire!?Allison Sturtzel, 11,5th, St. Francis Many of the ideas and objects in our everyday lives?from the theories of gravity and volume that we learn to the ^^^^^^^ sugar substitutes and corn flakes that we taste, from the vaccinations and peni? cillin that cure us to the stars and moons that amaze us, from the nylon that we wear to the Dead Sea Scrolls that we worship?were all discovered via serendipity, in other words, by accident. To be specific, the Rosetta Stone, which unlocked the mystery of the enigmatic Egyptian hieroglyphics, evidences this point. This discovery transpired when a French soldier accidentally found the stone while making repairs to a fort. To? day, because of this finding, we are able to read and translate the hieroglyphics, further opening a window into ancient Egypt.... This book enhances the read? er's perception and curiosity to identify new discoveries from mistakes and en? courages their investigation. Every indi? vidual can benefit from the instructional, stimulating experiments that accompany each story, developing their creativity and ability to meticulously distinguish a new idea from the old.?Punteet Masson, 15,11th, South Brunswick HS, Kendall Park, N], TIP Program The Universe Explained: the Earth Dweller's Guide to the Mysteries of the Space. Colin Ronan. Henry Holt and Co., 1994. $35. (12+) This book covers a wide variety of topics from the possibility of living on Mars to worrnholes in the universe. It also has many pictures and easy-to-fol? low illustrations for every section. It is an excellent book for short answers to tough questions ... [but] it does not go in depth enough on any topic for much use in a report. I recommend it for those who are interested in learning a little bit on lots of different, unrelated topics, but not for those who need it as a source for a re? port.?Carl Dohrman, 13,9th, Grissom HS, Huntsville, AL, TIP Program 1995 November-December 565</page><page sequence="9">Good Benito. ^^^^^^^^ Alan Lightman. Pantheon Books, 1994. $21. (14+) Good Benito, which focuses on readers who are 14 and above, provides a plot worthy of a reader's attention. This work of fiction chronicles the life of physicist Bennett Lang, an amiable character whose search for knowledge is evident through? out the story. It skips through time, ob? serving Bennett's life from beginning to end in no particular order.... The most im? portant thing is how the book focuses on Bennett's love of science. It tells of the ex? periments that he conducted with the lab that he constructed when he was young and the friends that he had made throughout the years that he had worked in science. This, in and of itself, is suffi? cient reason to read the book.?Victor Or Wcowski, 16, 11th, Wilmington, NC, NCSSM Biology Fundamentals. Gil Brum and Larry McKane. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995. $55.95. (18+) In my opinion, (here were two features that represented Biology Fundamentals well. First, the intriguing and colorful il? lustrations heightened my curiosity for the biological world. Each photograph, drawing and description was well-placed and informative. Second, the real-life, written examples found at the begin- A ning of every chapter succeeded in ^fl accurately describing current and ^Hj historic accounts of biological discov eries and issues. Overall, I would strongly recommend [it] to anyone in- Vj terested in biology, the study of life.? Wi Kristen Keon, 16,11th, River Ridge HS, K/ New Port Richey, FL, TIP Program Exploring Energy: Power from the Sun, Muscles, Fuel, Machines, Investments, and Atoms. Gallimard Jeunesse. Scholastic, Inc., 1995. $19.95. (8-12) The book ... is an excellent book for beginners. It is easy reading and has I would recommend this book to anybody interest? ed in the basics of science.? Marc Borg, 13,8th, The Selwyn School, Argyle, TX, TIP Program The Smithsonian Visual Timeline of Inventions: From the First Stone Tools to Satellites and Superconductors. Richard Platt. Dorling Kindersley, 1994. $16.95. (8-12) This is a wmderfully informative book. It tells what inventions were made and when.... I never knew that stained-glass windows were invented in 1065, false teeth were invented in 1770, the typewriter was invented in 1873, the credit card... in 1950, and I bet you didn't know when the baby carriage was invented in 1733. This inter? esting book has inventions from 600,000 b.c. to today, and for the future. Did you know that pretty soon we will all be talking into video telephones?... When I first looked at the book, I immediately wanted to read it. And now, after I've read it, I'd like to read it over and over. Any kid can read it. There aren't hard words, and the pictures are really good. I wouldn't change a thing about Inventions. I will tell all my friends about this book. Even adults will like it.?Drew Larimore, 11, 5th, St Francis Pytwnu Darwin: Nature Reinterpreted. Piero Ventura. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1995. $16.95. (8-12) The first thing one might notice when reading Darwin: Nature Reinterpreted is the deceptiveness of its title. Hie book does, as is expected, contain descriptions of Charles Darwin's life and work, but it also covers topics such as the work of Carolus Linnaeus, the 16m-oentury explorers of North America, the gardens of Thomas Jefferson and Claude Monet, oceans and space exploration, and Amundsen's and Scott's race to the South Pole. It seems that the purpose... is not only to present Dar? win and his theories to young people, but also to explore hurrtanity's past and pre? sent attitudes and behavior toward nature. Piero Ventura accomplishes this goal with a text full of trivia, quotes and anecdotes, and with his colorful, detailed, engaging and aesthetically pleasing illustrations. The only major criticism this reader can make... concerns its obvious and ubiquitous political correctness. This is manifested in two ways: First, Ventura embraces a severely environmentalist theme. This notion is admirable, but it is executed in such a way as to belittle the importance of subjects such as the En? lightenment and Western expansion, and their tremendous impact upon modem society. This type of subjectivity should not take place in any text meant to be his? torically accurate. Second, Ventura, like many other authors, and especially those whose target audience is children, finds it necessary to sculpt and soften the more harsh realities of historic fact. For exam? ple, statements such as "The book's... theories instantly became the subject of heated debate" and "The reaction in some quarters was harsh" do not even begin to depict jjhe furor, ridicule and animosity sparked by Darwin's theories. Whether this type of historical revision is accept? able in a ch?dren's book is up to the indi? vidual reader to decide. Otherwise, Dar ivin: Nature Reinterpreted provides a thorougjily digestible and inoffensive presentation of Darwinism and some in? teresting insights into hurnai?dnd's ever changing relationship with the natural world?Doris Leung, 16,11th, Port Char? lotte, HS, Port Charlotte, FL, TIP Program Pyramid: Discover the Timeless Grandeur of the Pyramids. James Put? nam. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1994. (8+) The pictures and photographs from this Eyewitness series book are fantastic.... [Theyl help the reader understand how and why the pyramids were built, what is stored inside them and how they have been destroyed by religious groups.... The book is never boring, and there is not one page that doesn't have neat pictures that would make you want to read on.?Steven Matly, 10,5th, St. Francis 566 American Scientist, Volume 83</page><page sequence="10">Insides, Outsides, Loops and Lines. Herbert Kohl. W. H. Freeman and Com? pany, 1995. $12.95. (9-12) My first impression of this book by looking at the cover was that it looked like an art book, but it still looked pretty good. After I flipped through the pages and looked at the pictures, I still thought it was like an art book, but it looked fun and interesting. It turned out to be a book of math puzzles and games. My favorite were the games where you and a friend would alternate adding lines and shapes and try to put them together into a picture.?Alex Brayton, 11,5th, St. Francis Flying Saucers Are Everywhere. Tom McHugh. Prometheus Books, 1995. $12.95. (12+) If you believe in UFOs, aliens or the Bermuda Triangle, and you enjoy a great laugh, this is the book for you. But if you're planning on doing some serious scientific reading, pass this book on by, be? cause from the beginning the author tells you, "A person who buys this book and believes eveiything in it is called naive." Flying Saucers Are Everywhere is a par? ody about any and every occult issue known to man. The creative cover illus? tration catches your eye and the book never lets you go. "Trekkies" and X-Files fanatics will get a kick out of it, but to others each page will be a long and bor? ing journey through jokes they don't un? derstand. Though the book is targeted for 12-year-olds and up, parents should probably hold off buying this book until their child is 14 or 15 so the meaning isn't lost.... As long as you, the reader, realize that this book was meant for en? tertainment purposes only, you should enjoy [it] as profusely as I did.?Shawna Thomas, 14, 9th, HS for the Visual and Per? forming Arts, Houston, TX, TIP Program.
