The present analysis is part of a larger study of crime and punishment in the early Renaissance. The original study focuses on Le Stinche, a Florentine prison that reflected changing currents of legal and penal thought from the beginning of the fourteenth century to the fall of the republic in I530. I shall not here attempt to trace tlle development of criminal law and penal treatment that was manifested in the adminis- tration of the prison or in records of commitments of prisoners to the institution. Our present concern is with the derivation of its name.2 Although I shall not analyze the historical importance of the prison, it should be noted that we are dealing with important history. Le Stinche prison has significance both to the history of Florentine political and legal institutions and to the evolution of the idea of imprisonment 1 This study in historical penology was supported by a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and a U. S. Government (Fulbright) research grant. The author is grateful to Thorsten Sellin, who first brought Le Stinche to his attention; to Gino Corti and Roberto Abbondanza for paleographic assistance in the early stages of this research; to Carlo Varetti and Domenico Vittorini for their abiding interest and helpful sugges- tions; and to his wife, Lenora WolEgang, for her tireless help in gathering data in the Archivio di Stato di Firenze. 2 Most of the basic data for this study of Le Stinche are foundin the Archivio delle Stinche in the Archivio di Stato di Firenze. These are manuscripts comprising S2I volumes, cov- ering the period from I343 to I 808, almost entirely untapped by historians. Although the name Le Stinche is plural in Italian and refers to a collection of cells and buildings, I shall speak of them as a single institution or prison. This is a semantically sim- plified procedure and conforms to empiric reality, for the buildings had continuous phys- ical contiguity, were surrounded by an enclosing wall, and were under one administration or legal authority.

Francesco Berni, the satirical poet, was imprisoned here for debt during the fifteenth century, and he incorporated the name of the prison into one of his poetns, entitled In lode del debito', directed to Alessandro del Caccia. Berni writes: O gloriose Stinche di Firenze, Luogo celestial, luogo divino, Degno di centomila riverenze, A voi ne nien la gente a capo chino, E prima che la vostra scala saglia S'abbassa in sull'entrar dell'usciolino **** ............... .

Com'uno e quivi, e giunto finalmente A quello stato ch' Aristotil pose, Che '1 senso cessa, e sol opra la mente.4 Giovanni Villani, one of the best-known chroniclers of the city, spent some time in Le Stinche. In volume tV of one of the Sansoni editions of Villani's Cronica5 a section entitled 'Elogio di Giovanni Villani', writ- ten by Pietro Nlassa, includes a full reference to the imprisonment of Villani in Le Stinche: 3 There is no treatise on penology in English that mentions Le Stinche, except a brief reference by John Howard, the English penal reformer, who visited Le Stinche in the eighteenth century, in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (London, I792), Sec- tion IV, 'An Account of Foreign Prisons and Hospitals', p. I08. Among Italian penological works, the fullest discussion of Le Stinche is found in Martino Beltrani-Scalia, Sulgoverno e sulla riforma delle carceri (Torino, I867). Two briefessays written at the time the priso was demolished in the nineteenth century are useful general descriptions but make no reference to the meaning or importance of Le Stinche in historical penology: Fruttuoso Becchi, 'Sulle Stinche di Pirenze', L'Ittustratore Fiorentino (Firenze, I839), and Pietro Fraticelli, Delle antiche carceri di Firenze denominate Le Stinche (Firenze, I834).

There is no need to recount here the story of the document found by the authorities that contained a list of names of some eighteen persons, of whom Machiavelli was one.9 Pietro Paolo Boscoli, who was one of the two youthful fanatics resolved to assassinate Giuliano and Lorenzo de'Medici, had accidentally dropped the paper. Although Boscoli and his associate, Agostino Cap- poni, confessed on the rack, they contended that none of the persons on the list knew oftheir tyrannicidal designs.

Two of these were composed while l1e was sitting in his prison cell and for the purpose of obtaining a pardon. In one of these he descrilDes the prison, after having suSered six turns on the rack. He complains of the stench and the fact that tlae walls were crawling with vermin so lDig and swollen that they seemed like moths. One prisoner was lDeing chained, another loosened, and a third crying that the ropes were hoisting him too far from the ground. It was from the Stinche that these lines to Giuliano were written: I ho Giuliano in gambe un paio di geti Con sei tratti di corda in sulle spalle L'altre miserie mie non vo contalle . . .

A century earlier, in t344, an- other satirical poet, Dino di Tura,13 was imprisoned here for debt. Moreover, in his famous Diario, Luca Landucci refers to many less not- able persons who were sent to the Stinche.14 In his entry for 27 August I478, Landucci mentions three men who 'wereimprisonedin the Stinche, as it was said that they had been guilty of treachery'. 15 Later in the same year he records that 'the traitor from Pistoia, called Piero Baldinotti, was taken in the executioner's cart and hung, and the son was impris- oned for life in the Stillche.'16 In I496 Filippo Corbizi, Giovanni Benizi, and Giovanni da Tignano were arrested and sent to the Podesta for try illg to give out voting schedules secretly at a council to elect the Signo- ria. They were sentenced 'to be stretched on the rack four times . . . and were imprisoned in the Stinche for li'fe, on account of the above busi- ness'.17 A year later tlle priest who had 'secretly declared that Fra Giro- lamo and Fra Dometiico and all the Frati at San Marco were Sodomites, on account of a grudge he had against them' and who later 'in the pres- ence of all the people said tllat he had told lies and publicly confessed his error' was sent to the Stinche 'where he was confined in a cage'.18 Le Stinche has some relationship to art history. Artists, such as Cen- nino Cennini in I437, were occasionally incarcerated in the prison for debt. 19 Moreover, the earliest known representation ofthe Palazzo Vec- chio in Florence was originally a fresco on one of the interior walls of the prison.20 Although sometimes attributed to Giottino, little is known was between I429 and I430. F. T. Perrens (Histoire de Florence, Paris, I883, VI, 234, n. I) contends that Giovanni Cavalcanti was in the Stinche until I440. 13 Archivio delle Stinche, Archivio di Stato di Firenze, 8I, C.

The painting represents an allegory of the expulsion of the Duke of Athens, whose portrait is the tall figure on the right. St. Anna is enthroned and supported by angels on either side as she points to the Palazzo Veeehio, represented as it then stood. The saint presents the banners of the eity of Florenee to the new guardians, who, clothed in armor, kneel to do her homage. The dethroned duke tran1ples on the symbols of justiee and law, and elasps a monster that is symbolic oftrea s son, a hoary human head with the tail of a scorpion. This famous fresco presllmably was removed from the Stinehe when tlle prisoll was de molished in I 83 3 . On the present corner of the Via Ghibellina and the Via dellIsola delle Stinche there is a small tabernacle that was once part of the ex- terior ofthe prison. The only thing that remains ofthe old prison on its site is this tabernacle, so far as can be determined. A painting which decorates it was executed in I6I6 by Giovanni da San Giova1lni2l and represents a Florentine merchant bestowing alms on the prisoners ofthe Stinche who are looking through the bars of the windows. Christ and two saints stand beside the charitable donor and angels hover above. On the extreme right is a young man, head tilted over his left shoulder and looking out from the painting. He represents a portrait, we are told, of the artist himself.22 To the contemporary Florentine, Le Stinche signifies a small street; to the Florentine historian Le Stinche may be known as a once-famous prison; but to the contadini in Val di Greve, the name means the slowly decaying remains of an old castello. Like the descriptions of the prover- bial elephant, whose separate parts are described by independent blind investigators, each one of these conceptions of Le Stinche appears cor- rect, yet they lack synthesis and continuity. Tlle purpose of the remain- ing discussion is etymological, to supply the link in nomenclature be- tween a contemporary street, a former prison, and a castle above the Val di Greve in the province of Chianti. 21 For a careful study of this artist, see Edoardo FI. Giglioli, Giovanni da San Giovanni (Giovanni Mannozzi, 1592-1636) (Firenze, I949).

These prisons included the Bellanda, the Paliazze, the Burelle, and the Volognano.25 23 In the original document (see n. 24 below), the date is given as 'I296/97 marzo I2' in traditional Florentine form. It should be kept in mind that the Florentine calendar from the tenth century until I749 inclusive follows the Stilo dell'Incarnazione al modo fio- rentino, i.e., the new year is dated from 25 March and continues until the subsequent 25 March. Hence, the period from 25 March to 3 I December always corresponds to the modern calendar while the period from I January to 25 March is always in the Florentine style, a numerically recorded year behind the modern form. (See A. Cappelli, Cronologia, cronografia e calendarioperpetuo, Milano, I930, pp. I I-I2). 24 Provvisioni, Archivio di Stato di Firenze, 8, c. 5Ir, entitled, 'Super quibusdam car- ceribus faciendis pro Communi'. Peripheral to our main concern with the derivation of the name of the prison is the ex- tremely important fact for the history and evolution of penological thought that juve- niles, on petition of their parents, could be placed in the new prison for purposes of cor- rection. Extensive examination of the Archivio delle Stinche bears evidence to the fact that it was not uncommon practice during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to place children in this institution as a reformative device. 25 Bellanda referred to a detention prison situated near San Pietro Scheraggio; the name was given by the proprietor of the land. It was destroyed in I290, according to a provision of 24July (Provvastoni, 4, c . 23; also G . B . Uccelli, II Palazzo del Potestd, Firenzc, I865, p. I45) which paid a certain Feo di Costantino for the work that he did 'et pro de- structione carceris Bellande'. The Paliazze were cells near the market of San Pietro, where a pala;z;zo named Pag- liazzo was located. Only the nobility were placed in these prisons, which were eliminated in I282. The Burelle were also privately owned prisons rented by the commune, principally for temporary custody of political of Nenders. Situated in those quarters of the city known as</page><page sequence="8">MARVIN E. WOLFGANG 155 Tl1e new prison authorized in I297 was not to be located on ground that was historically significant or financially valuable. The land that was chosen had been confiscated frotn the Uberti family at least since I268 and formed an isolated quadrilateral near the Ghibellina gate, be- side the church of San Simone.26 The Uberti family was held ill disre- pute because of Farinata degli Uberti, who had been considered a traitor for having aided the Ghibellines of Siena and Manfred's Germans to defeat the Florentine GuelEs in the famous victory of Montaperti on 4 September I260. The poetic inlduence of Dante and his reference to Farinata27 as a kind of savior of Florence because the latter opposed sack- ing the city had no opportunity to affect favorably the city fathers at this early date.28 Consequently, the Uberti plot was already considered infamous grou1ld and the coerced residence of political offenders, debt- ors, murderers, prostitutes, and other common-law criminals in a prison there appeared as a fitting association. Continuity of infamy was the underlying social thought that contributed to establishing oS1cially the locus of the new prison. After tlhe decision had been made in I297 to erect a new prison, funds were appropriated, designs planned, and construction begun. Most like- ly because of a lack of public funds, work on the prisoll did not proceed with alacrity. By I30I we can find several references to the fact that construction was still in process. For example, volume I I of the Prov- visioni for 24 November I30I ends with such a reference: 'Et intelligan- tur esse carceres Communis Florentie non solum veteres carceres, sed etiam novi carceres qui presentialiter construuntur pro Communi Flor- entie in populo Sancti Symonis.'29 Sant'Apollinare, San Firenze, and near San Simone, they are known to have existed at least from I260 (Beltrani-Scalia, op. cit., p. 265). Referring to the fact that the llame Burelle is derived from buro, meaning 'dark place', Beltrani-Scalia cites Dante, who says in Canto XXXIV ofthe Inferno: Non era camminata di palagio La 'v'eravam, ma natural burella Ch'avea mal suolo, e di lume disagio.

This provision should end some of the contradictions regarding the date of construction. Cf. Edgcumbe Staley, The Guilds of Florence (London, I906), p. 89; Francis A.

Exile, banishment, confiscation of property, plunderilag of villas, tor- ture, and executions were suiered by menabers of both political fac- tions.30 Occasionally tlhe circle of retribution was broken witlh political amnesty granted to tlhose previously sent into exile, but only wlhen su- periority of miglit and numbers among tlhe latest captors of governmellt could permit reduction of tension and fear of attack. Those who had fought against an incumbent group or those who were driven from public oS1ce and high places came to be placed in local prisons for vary- ing periods oftime. Usually, the prison experience meant detention un- til some form of corporal punishment, including death, was imposed. The construction of a new public prison in Florence during the first years of tlle fourteenth century provided centralized quarters for these political oSenders, and the idea of imprisonment as a form of punisll- ment per se without subsequent flogging, mutilation, or branding be- ca1ne an integral part of Florentine penal law. The naming of the new prison is intimately interrelated to a small segment of this political history, and it is necessary to recall briefly the oscillations of party factions from I30I, when the new prison of the commune was under construction, to I304, when the first inmates were led into the walled quadrilateral area next to San Simone. On I Novem- ber I30I, Charles, Count of Valois and brother of King Philip the Fair, entered Florence in peace, having convinced the leaders of the Bianchi (at that moment the dominant party) that he came in good faith from Pope Boniface to restore peace in Tuscany.31 But no sooner had the priors conferred power on him than the French knights appeared in arms in the streets and Corso Donati entered the city with an armed band. Donati was from an ancient house of Guelfnobles and sided with the Neri, while the rich bourgeoisie and all who envied the power of the Parte Guelfa were identified with the Bianchi. Too late did the Bi- - (London, I9OI), p. 73; Fraticelli, Op. Cit., p. I2; Becchi, Op. Cit., p. 28. It is obvious from the above mentioned-provision that Fraticelli's reference to July I304 as the date when construction ofthe Stinche began is erroneous. Becchi, however, cites the correct date. 30 Relative to crime and punishment among these groups in Florence, see WolEgang, 'Political Crimes and Punishments in Renaissance Florence', cited in note IO. 31 The account of this episode can be found in any standard history of Florence. I am especially lndebted to Ferdinand Schevill, A History of Florencefrom the Founding ofthe City through the Renaissance (London, I936), pp. I73-I75, and Janet Penrose Trevelyan, A Short History ofthe Italian People (New York, I956), pp. I32-I33.</page><page sequence="10">MARVIN E. WOLFGANG 157 anchi come to real;ze that the papal peacemaker had corne to return the city to their enemies. The Neri seized the rnagistracy, and after several abortive attempts at reconciliation, the French prince agreed, in March I302, to the production of a docurnent showing that the Bianchi leaders were plotting to subvert his rule. They were surnrnoned to appear be- fore the Signori, but ffed to Pisa, Arezzo, and Pistoia. Their apparent alliance with these traditional enernies of Florence gave the Neri, now in power, some degree of rationalization for their wholesale expulsion of the Biallchi that followed. During I302 over six hundred sentences of property confiscation and exile were pronounced against individual members of the Bianchi, and arnong those condernned to death by burning if ever they should fall into the hands of the republic was Dante Alighieri, who shared his fate wii the father of Petrarch and his poet friend, Giido Cavalcanti, member of an illustrious family among the Bianchi. After Charles of Valois left Florence in April I302, new lists of Bianchi to be exiled were formulated and 'other hundreds were sent . . . throughout the length and breadth of the peninsula'.32 Tlle exiles were naturally driven into the arms of the Ghibellines throughout Tuscany and with the latter's assistance made several unsuc- cessful attempts at a forcible return. Unrest and instability continued to characterize tlle political dominance of the Neri. In I304 Cardinal Fra Niccolo da Prato Domenicano was sent from the pope to quell the civil discord in Florence and to pacify the enemies lying outside ie city. Trying to play both sides against the middle, however, the cardinal fell under suspicion from both groups and returned to Rome on 4 June, leaving, instead of peace, the excommunication of Prato, Pistoia, and Florence.33 Irritated by llis treatment by the Florentines, the cardinal in- stigated the Bianchi exiles to attack the city. One of these surprise at- tacks just barely failed to recapture power for the Bianchi, but having been repulsed and put to flight, many were captured and hanged during the summer. Enflamed by tllese attacks, the Florentines, with Bartolino Alberti, the gonfaloniere,34 set out from the city to recapture surround- ing territory that had rebelled against them during the last encounter. The first to be expunged was the stronghold ofthe Cavalcanti family,35 32 Schevill, op. cit., p. I74. 33 Villani, Cronica, Lib. VIII, Cap. LXIX; Scipione Ammirato, Istorie Fiorentine, Lib.

After a short and futile resistance, the inhabitants ofthe castle sur- rendered to the GuelEs and were driven back to the city as political pris- oners. The new Carceri di Comune were not yet completed,36 but they were suilcielltly ready for habitation. Thus did the Cavalcanti and the defenders of the Castello delle Stinche become the first prisoners to be * * ^ * ^ ncarceratec w 1n ti ze new pr1son 1n I304. There is abundant documentation for these episodes in Florentine history. Details of the storming of the castello are lacking, however; only a bare descripiion and the names involved are available. All the early chroniclers as well as later scholars better trained in historiography agree on the basic facts ofthe seizure ofthe Castello delle Stinche from the Cavalcanti and the fact that the first prisoners in the new carceri in Florence were the inhabitants of the castello. It therefore becomes obvi- ous how the new prison received its name. Unfortunately, the earliest records of the prison were destroyed in the siege of the institution in I343, during the popular overthrow ofthe government ofthe Duke of Athens.37 Consequently, there are no documents of commitments38 to the prison in I304, whiclh would be final proofofthe fact that the Cav- alcanti family from the Castello delle Stinche were definitely the first persons to be oi1cially incarcerated in the prison. However, Villani,39 36 SE}eltrani-Scalia, op. cat., p. 268, gives I3I9 as the date of completion of construction. As late as 26 March I3I9 money was still being appropriated for construction of the prison (Uccelli, op. cit., p. I46). 37 The sacking of Le Stinche durmg the uprising against the Duke of Athens is men- tioned by many historians. See, for example, the accounts by M.

Among those who refer to a spe- cific month, Villani,50 Villari,5l Cavalcanti,52 and Reumont53 give Au- gust I304, whereas Rastrelli54 and Fraticelli55 speak of September oftlle same year. Most of the historians of the nineteenth century wllo rely heavily upon Villani and Amrnirato for source material refer to August as the month during which the prison was used for the first time.56 The weight of carefully collected evidence and of diligent historical research is convincing reason for contending that it was during August I304 that the doors ofthe new prison were opened to prisoners for tlle f1rst time; that these prisoners were members of the Cavalcanti family; and that as Bianchi and political opponents of the incumbent Neri in Florence, they were seized in their stronghold, the Castello delle Stinche in Chianti. While it becomes obvious that the new Florentine prison in I304 adopted the name of the fortress from which the f1rst prisoners came, it is necessary to probe one step deeper in this analysis of the etymology of Stinche in order to understand the full meaning of the term. To do this we must return to ie castello and its geographical position. The Castello delle Stinche was considered to be one of the strongest for- tresses maintained by the Ghibellines outside Florence. It was approxi mately 6.6 kilometers from the Comune di Greve a1zd near Panzano in the Chianti region of Tuscany. It was situated to the southwest of Mon- te Querciabella on the western side of a homonymous hill that rises 520 meters, dividing tlle Val di Pesa and the Val di Greve.57 ducci, Guada allustrata della Val da Pesa (Sancasciano, I904), pp. 55-56; Walther von Lim- burger, Die Gebdude von Florenz (Leipzig, I9I0), p.

WOLFGANG 161 The singular nouns stinco (m.) and, arcllaically, stinca (£) are derived from Longobardian roots al1d refer to tlle front edge of the tibia, the shill, or shinbone.58 In Old Higll German this same part of the anatomy is referred to as scina; in German, schiene; in Anglo-Saxon, scinu; in Middle English, shine atld schine; and in Dutch, scheen.59 It was gen- erically logical to project this anthropomorphic meaning to a topo- graphically similar phenomenon. Thus, in Italian, the words also de- rzoted the top of a hill, the highest ridge of a mountain, the apex of a knoll. There is a close relationship between the archaic stinca and cima in Italian, for both words refer to the ridge or crest of a hill. The English word chine illustrates the same duality, meaning both backbone, or spine, and ridge or crest (echine in French and eschine in Old French), and has the same Teutonic origin as scina, which, as stated above, means . . tl Dla. Although there has been some inconsistency in usage in gender, ref- erence to a ridge or top of a mountain has made use of both stinco and stanca (plurals, respectively, stinchi and stinche). One source, under stinca, tells us: 'Piu altre terre poste in fortissimo luoghi in sulla stinca della time. However, not until I452 was it burned and presumably destroyed. See Domenico di Lionardo Boninsegni, Storie della citta di Firenze dall'anno 1410 al 1460 (Firenze, I637), p. IOI. 'Distrutto', however, does not necessarily connote total destruction or oblitera- tion. Today the ground known as Stinche Alto and the knoll (poggio tondo) on which the castello presumably was located are owned by Ing. Giorgio Socci, from Lamoli. An eighteenth-century handmade map in the possession of Ing. Socci clearly shows the out- lines of this property and the position of the hill. The author made an excursion to this land inJune I958, and a cursory examination reveals the remains of an old building, now in a state of disuse and disrepair, whose ground floor, fortifying wall, oven, and fireplace may date from the fourteenth or early fifteenth century. The additions above the ground floor are obviously much later, even contemporary. This is probably the only building remaining in this general area of the castello, and although these remains cannot be la- beled the Castello delle Stinche, they may have been a portion of the group of buildings that constituted the Cavalcanti stronghold. Further examination under the scrutiny of an architectural historian specializing in medieval castelli is necessary to determine the age of the present ruins that stand unattended on this isolated poggio tondo near Panzano in Chianti. 58 Niccolo Tommaseo and Bernardo Bellini suggest; 'Altri forse dal ted. Stengel, gambale, pedale, tronco, o dal celt. gall. Stang, stecco brocco' (Dizionario della lingua Italiana, Torino, I872, IV, I2I6). Nicola Zingarelli gives the root as a fusion ofthe Longo- bardian skinko and of stecco (Vocabolario della lingua Italiana, Bologna, I957, p. I537). It should be recalled that the Lombards were one of the Teutonic tribes that invaded and settled in the Po Valley between 568 and 774. 59 Tommaseo and Bellini, op. cit., IV, I2I6.</page><page sequence="15">162 LE CARCERI DELLE STINCHE montagna.'60 Elsewhere in the same source we are given a quotation from Salvini; 'Sotto il nevato monte di Parnasso ch'a lo stinco rivolto inver Ponente.'61 Du Cange, in the sixth volume of Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis, uses stinca and stincus to refer both to the Florentine prison aIld to the apex of a mountain.62 The same may be said of Pieri's Toponomastica63 alld of Repetti's Dizionario geografico.64 Thus we see honv the Cavalcanti fortress, situated on a ridge between Val di Greve and Val di Pesa, was named the Castello delle Stinche, the topographic term having been incorporated into the proper name ofthe castle. More than one crest appears in the terrain of this region, and this fact most likely accounts for the use of the plural rather than the singu- lar: stinche rather than stinco or stinca. By the middle of the fifteenth century, the word stirlche (£ pl.) was generally used to refer to the Florentine prison, and in that century a high proportion ofthose imprisoned there were sent as public or private debtors. Andare alle Stinche 'to go to the Stinche', or 'going to the Stin- che', came to mean 'going into debt' and perhaps being imprisoned for it. References that were to appear in the fifth edition ofthe Tzocabolario degli Accademaci della Crusca, should the printing have gone through the letter 's' (which it did not), include the phrase Andare alle Stinche, and can be found in the files of the academy.65 Somewhat as we use the phrase 'death and taxes', in English, Florentines were known to say 'O nelle Stinche o in chiesa', which meant that one's fate lay between the despairing alternatives of going to prison for debt or dying.66 Althougll the nouns stinco and stinca have been seen to overlap in their mea1zings of 'shin' and 'hilltop' in some of the above illustrations, the masculine noun survives in modern Italian as 'shin', and stinca, as 'hill- top', has disappeared. Some of the following uses of forms of both words, however, depend upon a knowledge of the etymology of the two words and their duality.

WOLFGANG 163 of stinco-stinca added dual meanings to popular speech. Stincata and stincatura both refer to a kick in the shins; the first to the kick itself, and the second to the mark it would leave. Frizzi says in his work that the expression 'Tu darai una stincata' meant that you will be put in the Stinche. Thus it was a local witticism to refer to going to the Carceri delle Stinche as receiving a kick in the shins ! Another extension ofthe name for the prison was in the verb stincare; 'Tu stincasti, eh?' And the person who was so recognized as destined to be sent to the prison was warned, 'Fagli riverenza'.68 The ironic rever- ence that the incoming prisoner was forced to pay as he entered was to bend down because the door through which he entered was so low. Berni, as we have already seen, mentioned this same ironic reverence, saying the prison was 'Degno di centomila riverenze'. With the prison, concludes Frizzi, 'caddero anche i due motti notati'.69 Although there appears to be no etymological association between stench and stink in English and stinche in Italian, the word stinche was used occasionally as a metaphor for bad conditions of life and even for a bad odor. In a sonnet byJacapo Paganelli, sent, in I468, to his cousin, An- tonio Paganelli, the poet writes: 'E son in una stufa, onde un odore surge, che quel delle Stinche . . .'.70 In time the word became a generic term for prisons even outside Florence, but the principal reference after the fourteenth century remained that of the prison in Florence. In the foregoing analysis we have observed not onlyfrom what but also how this Florentine prison, whose construction was going on in I30I and whose walls contained the first prisoners in I304, came to be known as Le Stinche. It is mostly a posteriori interpretation to oGer rea- sons whr the new prison of the fourteenth century was thus named, but we may suggest that applying the name of the famous and imposing castello to the prison added to the disgrace of the Cavalcanti family and of the Ghibellines in general. The dignified name was associated with the indignity of restricted freedom imprisonment. The nomenclature that was adopted symbolized and stigmatized a political fall. As Schevill says, 'it tickled the rising third estate to deride their enemies, the mag- nates, by attaching a high-sounding feudal title to a hideous domestic lockup'.71 There is considerable evidence to contradict Schevill's refer- 68 Ibid. 69 Ibid., p. 236. 70 Francesco Flamini, La lirica Toscana del Rinascimento (Pisa, I89I), p. 546. 71 Schevill, op. cit., p. 230-</page><page sequence="17">164 LE CARCERT DELLE STINCHE enee to the prison as a 'hideous domestic lockup' in the early fourteenth century when the name was first applied to the prison, but I agree with Schevill that calling the prison Le Stinche was, in I304, a form of social . . c .erlslon. Prisons in Florence, as elsewhere and at present in Italy, were known originally and off1cially as carceri di Comune. Only after the use of the building as a prison is the more specific proper name of a street, a per- son, or a special locus in a city or region applied to it. This was the case, as noted, with Bellanda, Paliazze, and Volognano.72 A people tends to popularize oitcial terms and institutional designations, even to refer to a continuously present threat of a dismal fate with ironically affectionate or diminutive terms. We may reeall that the prison eell in tlle tower of the Palazzo Veeehio that held sueh notalDles as Cosimo in I433 and Savonarola in I498 has lDeen referred to as L'alberghettino.73 To the masses laeking politieal and eeonomie power, living under threat of fines, debts, eonvietions for violations of munieipal or guild ordinanees, the eentralized prison was a eomposite symbol of a fate shared by ae- quaintanees and family members. The high-walled group of buildings74 represented an ominous end for serious offienders and politieal traitors. But to minor law violators it meant a plaee of eonfinement for definite periods of time75-an innovation in the evolution of punishmelzt. For the Florentine eontemporary to the eonstruction of the prison and to the first commitments to the institution labeling the prison Le Carcere delle Stinche was indeed an oxymoron, at onee both facetious and aceurate. With time and the vacillations of political fortune, Le Stinche became, as we have noted, a generic term for prisons in general. Ill Siena, Pistoia, and elsewhere prisons were referred to as Le Stinche76 and the origin of the name was lost both to city off1eials and to some later chroniclers. Perhaps if the Cavalcanti castello had remained in use by the family, the name would not have stuek for the prison. Simultaneous 72 See note 25. Beltrani-Scalia, Op. Sit., p. 266, says: '. . . verso il I267 in una delle torri vi fu tenuto Geri da Volognano si vuole che da lui quel carcere abbia preso il nome di Volo- gnano'. 73 Gotti, op. cit., pp. 76-77. 74 For some data on the measurements and the general physical plant of the prison, see Becchi, op. cit., pp. 4I-48, and Fraticelli, op. cit., pp. I8-22. 75 Archivio delle Stinche, vol. 8I (I6 ottobre I343-3 I marzo I346) to vol.

WOLFGANG 165 disuse (and later destruetion) of the illustrious estate77 and initial (and eontinued) use ofthe prison that was endowed witln its name accounted for the terminologieal retention of Stinche for the prison. Very shortly after the prison was opened, official Florentine docu- ments began using the name Stinche with reference to the institution. The earliest city document to use the name in any form is one of the provvisioni of 28 February I305, in which reference is made to the 'Su- perstites carcerum de Stinchis et carceratorum in eis ubi erant carcerati Communis Florentie qui capti fuerunt in castro de Stinchis ....'78 This offileial doeument firmly establishes the faet that the inhabitants of the Castello delle Stinehe were imprisoned here. The first record of a com- mitment to the Stinehe prison may be found in volume 8 I of the Archi- vio delle Stinche under the date I6 Oetober I343.79 As previously men- tioned, the sacking and burning of mueh of the prison during an upris- ing against the tyrannical rule of the Duke of Athens in I343 aeeounts for the loss of eommitment reeords between I304 and Oetober I 343 . Inprovvisioniandstatutisubsequentto28 February I305, thenewname for the prison in Florenee is found without referenee to the statement 'eapti fuerunt in castro de Stinchis', and it is part of the heading of a provision evell as early as 4 May I305: 'Sindieatus eontra superstites Stincarum'.80 Tlle history of the prison from this point on, the innovations intro- dueed in administration and treatment of prisoners, the position of the prison in the history of penology, an analysis ofthe reeords of eommit- ment and diseharge of offienders, ehanges in the eriminal statutes, and an interpretive theoretical discussion of the relationship of these phenom- ena of crime and punishment to the culture milieu ofthe Rinascimento in Florence all of these topics constitute significant areas for further ex- amination. I shall conclude with but a brief reference to the fact of the structure itselfand what is remembered of it today. For over five hundred years Le Stinehe prison oecupied a large block of real estate a quadrilateral area isolated from the rest of the city by a street on eaeh side. Before the buildings inside the surrounding walls were torn down, the streets that bordered the prison were: Via del De- 77 See note 57. 78 Provvisioni, I2, c. I07, 28 February I305. In general, this provision states that the superintendents of the prison must pay the amounts which debtors, imprisoned in the Stinche, owe their creditors should such debtors escape from the prison. 79 Archivio dette Stinche, 8I, C. 3r, I6 October I343. 80 Provvisioni, I2, C.

The street names have changed over the course of time. After destruction ofthe prison, Via del Mercatino uras changed to Via dell' Isola delle Stinche as a reminder of the site of the former prison. Only Via del Lavatoi on the south retained its name when other streets were changed to Via Verdi (east), Via Ghibellina (north), Via dell'Isola delle Stinche (west), the present streets surrounding the area that was formerly Le Carceri delle Stinche.83 From Via Torta, past the small square in front of the Chiesa di San Simone, toward Via Ghibellina, the name of Stinche has become a short street reminiscent of a long history, a small stretch of land instead of a large building, and an open area that recalls a former enclosure. From a Ghibelline fortress on the summit of a hill in Val di Greve to a prison of significance during the early Renaissance, and finally to a contem- porary street in Florence, the name Stinche has evolved and survived.
