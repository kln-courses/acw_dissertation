<plain_text><page sequence="1">CELESTIN BOUGLE' RUTH MESSENGER INTRODUCTION SOLDIER, lecturer, writer, editor, teacher,-these have been the more important functions of Celes- tin Charles Alfred Bougle, Professor of the History of Social Economy at the Sorbonne and Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A dozen French periodicals de- voted to social sciences, philosophy and education have published his articles. Educational, political and economic leagues and associations have demanded his presence at their meetings as a speaker. Audiences of laboring men at Toulouse, theological students at Montauban, suffra- gists at Lille, teachers at Paris, pupils at Montpellier and students of philosophy at Bucharest have testified to his popularity as a lecturer. Yet, as a teacher he has done his most significant work, first, last and always imparting his sociological theories, whether in the academic hall, the public rostrum or the military canton- ment. At the age of fifty-six, he now occupies an enviable position commanding through his pupils, his writings and his varied activities, an influence on sociolog- ical thought in France which makes him one of the leaders in that country. What is the underlyin'g reason for this appeal? How does he make himself intelligible to such a variety of auditors and readers? By what fundamental principle does he apply his sociology to every sphere of life? These are the problems which render the study of Bougle so fascinating and his point of view so suggestive. WHAT IS SOCIOLOGY? Bougle answers this question for us in two ways. First in a bibliography of sociology published for French readers, in collaboration with Deat, he outlines the divisions of the subject and the studies related to it. Second, he has written a book called Qu'est-ce la Sociologie?, the first essay in which defines his point of I A discussion of Bougle's applications of social theory will be presented in a later paper.</page><page sequence="2">CELESTIN BOUGLE 9 view more particularly. Le Guide de 1'etzidiant en Sociologie presents the sub- ject under five divisions as follows: I. General Sociology, including the object and method of sociology, the connection of sociology with history, social sciences and psychology, social origins and the history of sociology. II. Domestic and Political Sociology, comprising the study of the family, nation and state, and the organization of international contacts between nations. III. Sociology of Law and Morals, with special reference to moral regulations and theories, law and sanctions. IV. The Sociology of Reli- gion. V. Economic Sociology which in- cludes problems of method, forms and regimes of production, problems of distri- bution and the history of economic and social doctrines. In addition to this general bibliography, Bougle inserts nu- merous special bibliographies throughout his books. Since these are not restricted to works in the French language but include contributions of English, German and American authors, they serve to enrich the conception of sociology as Bougle sees it, in the mind of the reader, and also to reveal the depth and scope of his scholarship. "Sociology," says Bougle, "is the sci- ence of social forms, their causes and results" (Les Idees egalitaires, p. 19).2 A social form in this sense is a group char- acterized by a common thought, proving its reality by modifiying the individuals which compose it. This psychological influence of the group on the individual is one field of sociological study. The group influence varies in accordance with external charact;eristics such as number, time, homogeneity, heterogeneity, in- clusiveness and organization. A second field of study is the classification of social forms, their relations and influence on ac- tivities. Economic, legal, moral, religi- ous and esthetic phenomena cause their function to vary. "Sociology does not undertake to show the reason of all his- toric phenomena but only wishes to bring to light how social formns modify them" (Qu'est-ce laeS/a Sociologie?, p. mm). A third field of study is that of the causes and results of social formns. As for the origin of society, it is best to take that for granted and not attempt to explain it, but show what forces modify its forms. These are the familiar factors, geographic, climatic and psychological. Material needs are factors too, but beware of the materialistic philosophy of history. In- stead of creating social forms, methods of production presuppose the;m. Technical transformations presuppose a develop- ment of science which itself depends on social forms. Ideas, especially those of legal system in vogue, as well as material interests influence them. Other factors in the realm of ideas which may influence the formns are moral, religious and esthetic. There is an interaction here, for habits, feelings and thoughts vary with the type of society. A particular reaction follows a particular form of association. But the individual, however much he seems to be imprisoned within any particular group, and to whatever extent he bears its characteristic mark, is liberated by the multiplicity of the social groups of which he may be a member. Bougle's formula runs as follows: "The increasing number of the societies in which an individual participates frees him relatively from each of them" (ibid. p. 17). There is a very obvious absence in this system of any psychol*dg&amp;cal basis such as the principle of imintation or conscious- ness of kind or indeed of any mental attrib- 2 In addition to the quotations used in this paper, Bcugle's ideas are reproduced as far as possiblc in his own characteristic phraseology.</page><page sequence="3">rn SOCIAL FORCES ute which would focus the attention upon the individual. Bougle anticipates in- quiry on this point, and thus explains the relation of sociology and psychology. Sociology, he says, does not exclude psy- chology. It studies the effect of social forms on mental states and how it stimu- lates combinations of ideas or reactions of feeling. But it still remains for us to discover the motive of these reactions in the exterior phenomena, which means that we must pass on from ourselves to historical phenomena in general (ibid., p. i6o-i6i). Thus Bougle emnphasizes the psychological influence of the group on the individual at the same time neglect- ing or ignoring the complementary influ- ence of native and individual mental traits on the group. Further reference will be made to this point. So brief a summary will scarcely suffice to place before us the full content of Bougle's theories but it serves to indicate his point of view and to introduce the special studies in which his theories are expanded. BOUGLE S WRITINGS Bougle's writings fall naturally into three groups, (i) a number of addresses and pamphlets inspired by the Great War, (z) studies devoted to special writers on social sciences including an edition of the works of Proudhon, (3) special works on sociological theory. The war studies comprise some eight or nine pamphlets and essays the titles of which reveal their special character. They evidently grew out of Bougle's war service which was of three kinds. He was corporal in the ambulance service, a lec- turer in the cantonments and educational centers and a writer in what might be called the publicity service connected the special committee "L'Effort de la France et ses Allies." In the last capacity he wrote two of the pamphlets mentioned above, one on Germany's peace strategy and the other an appreciation of Verhaeren, the French poet. This I shall mention later. Another interesting bit of work for the committee was an open letter circulated throughout the rural districts of France, preparing the peasant population for the coming of the American soldiers and urging them to welcome their new allies. This letter reached the United States by way of an American woman who was doing relief work in France and was trans- lated and reprinted in the "Outlook" of June )6, 1i9I8. One might expect the attitude of a French sociologist on the war to possess special significance. For the purpose of learning his general view, the essay on the causes of the war has been selected. This particular pamphlet is really a summary of a series of lectures given at the front, on the subject of the "Origins of the War and Contemnporaneous Germany." Its pur- pose is avowedly to remind the soldiers what they are fighting for and to strengthen their resolution. Thbe first entht'iasm had worn away and the strug- gle seemed interminable. This should be mentioned because it seems to have a bearing on the academic value of the essay in question. The first part of the sum- mary is a review of European diplomatic correspondence from June z8, I9I4, to August, I9I4. Responsibility is thrown on Germany by virtue of her intervention in the dispute and her prevention of ar- bitration. But even if all the documents were destroyed, says Bougle, the origin of the war would be found in the very nature of France and Germany, France desiring peace, liberty and justice, and Germany desiring domination, oppression and war. From this angle as well as from the dip- lomatic, Germany is responsible. The Kaiser stands in the foreground of the</page><page sequence="4">CELESTIN BOUGLE II German stage, essentially warlike, a believer in divine right. Beside him are his assistants and sympathizers in the military, industrial and intellectual groups. The details of the analysis follow familiar lines and may be omitted. Bougle con- cludes by noting that the opinion of the German people in general is difficult to estimate. He finds the masses char- acterized by a "personal docility without limnit and a collective pride without parallel" (Les Sources de la Guerre, p. 30). They may one day be delivered from the oppressive system under which they live. An essay like this doubtless served the immediate purpose for which it was intended but as an expression of sociologi- cal opinion it does not appear either original or particularly impressive. Bougle has contributed to the literature of sociology a number of studies devoted to special writers on the social sciences. Passing over a Latin doctoral dissertation, the first of these owes its existence to a traveling fellowship in Germany which he enjoyed in I893. He studied in Berlin under Moritz Lazarus, Georg Simmel and Adolf Wagner, and was moreover directly influenced by the work of Rudolf von Ihering who had died in i892. Inasmuch as the methodology of the social sciences was then of special interest in France, Bougle determined to study this partic- ular aspect of German work. Les Sciences sociales en Allemagne, les MeAthodes actuelles, i896, is the result. The four writers just mentioned are treated as representative. Lazarus in his Das Leben der Seele and in various articles published in Die Zeitschrift fir VTlkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft responds to the need of a social psychology which may aid in solving the problems which have arisen in history, individual psychology and anthropology. Simmel in his Einleitung in die Moral Wissenschaft and other writings tries to make clear the difficulties in formulating a science of morals and indicates the means of solving them. Wagner in his Grundlegung des politischen Okonomie is striving for a posi- tive rather than a speculative approach, while von Ihering in his writings on the philosophy of law, has traced the transi- tion of this science from a speculative to an inductive basis. In spite of the efforts of certain writers to achieve a more scien- tific method, on thewhole, Bougle observes among the Germans a strong tendency toward the psychological, abstract and theoretical but in France a tendency toward positivism. Another study of Simmel appears in a collection of essays by various authors, La Philosophie Allemande au XlXe Siecle, i9i2. Here we learn that Simmel, while he has formulated a genuine science of morals, historical and comparative, is primarily interested in the psychological aspects of sociology. He stresses the analysis of mental interactions as the essential nature of sociology and is to be classed with Tarde rather than Durkheiin. He says however, that "if Simmel were more of an objective sociologist he would not be such a suggestive moralist" (p. 203). The theories of Karl Marx are the sub- ject of a most interesting essay "Marxisme et Sociologie" which will be discussed later. This completes the list of German writers. Of Frenchmen, Bougle has been greatly interested in Cournot whose theories are made the subject of an essay entitled "Les Rapports de l'Histoire et de la Science sociale d'apres Cournot," I905, (in Qu'est- ce que la Sociologie?). The contro- versy as to method between the "histori- cal historians" and the "sociological historians" who discuss the relative role of the indi-vidual and universal in history, may be illumninated by Cournot's theory.</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL FORCES The point of the essay seems to be that while Cournot emphasizes the element of chance in history, the measurement of chance would serve to stress the essential and permanent. But Cournot's system em- braces more than a philosophy of history. It approaches the essential rhythm of nature. From such work as that of Cournot we may hope for an organiza- tion of the social sciences. History may become not an explanatory study of reality but an abstract knowledge of the general relations between facts. Gabriel Tarde is discussed in an article written for the R1evue de Paris, i9o5, and there described as an individualistic sociologist. So far we have noted on Bougle's part, a somewhat greater interest in pure social theory than in actual projects for social reform, if his choice of writers is signifi- cant. But the gap is filled by his essays on Saint-Simon and Proudhon. Those on Saint-Simon appear in his Chez les Prophetes Socialistes. I9I8, dedicated to Jean Jaures. He finds the permanent influence of Saint- Simon not only in the vocabulary which he supplied, e.g., "exploitation of man by man" and "progress by association," but also in the concepts of class conscious- ness and working class self-respect which were a preparation for the ideas of the Communist Manifesto. A most interesting essay in this collection traces the origin of the feminist aspect of socialism to the followers of Saint-Simon who in the dec- ade following i829, developed distinctive ideas regarding the political, economic and domestic emancipation of women. To Proudhon, Bougle evidently assigns the greatest importance of all the French writers on social reform in the earlier part of the igth century. He has made a complete edition of Proudhon's works and moreover has analyzed his theories in La Sociologie de Proudhon, I9II. It is not surprising that a man whose notion of sociology places the greater emphasis on the group, should find in the contrac- tual aspects of Proudhon's theory a genuine sociology. Yet he reminds us that Proudhon is popularly regarded as the father of anarchy. Bougle attempts to show that these two points of view appear side by side in his work and that he insists on the value of the social entity with the same vehemence that he does on the value of personality. We shall have occasion to return later to this dual conception of human life as an integral part of Bougle's own theory. In I9I9, Bougle wrote a short essay on Verhaeren, the French poet. Born in Belgium, Verhaeren spent his life in France at first an apostle of mysticism but in a later phase devoting his talent to the in- dustrial aspects of modern French civiliza- tion. It is perhaps in his emphasis on this particular side of French achievement that Bougle finds a spiritual kinship with Verhaeren for Bougle too, is interested in economic association. The earliest of Bougle's theoretical works is Les Idees egalitagires, I899. It is a study of ideas of equality from the socio- logical point of view and apart from related moral, economic and scientific problems. Sociology being conceived of as a science of social forms, the problem resolves itself into the question "What social forms favor the expansion of equality?" Ideas of equality are defined as practical ideas postulating the value of humanity and that of individuality. As such they take into account the differences of men as well as their resemblances. They recognize not the same actual faculties but the same rights and they demand not uniform but proportional sanctions. Ideas like these have appeared in history only within western civilization in two periods, the Graeco-Roman and the modern. Three</page><page sequence="6">CELESTIN BOUGLE T3 explanations have been proposed, the an- thl-opological which refers them to racial inheritance; the ideological which traces them to the classic, the Cartesian and the Christian spirit; and the sociological which makes them the result of group in- fluence. Setting aside the first and second Bougle accepts the third with the follow- ing conclusions: The numerical extension of the social group, its density, its mobil- ity and capacity for circulation are all conducive to equality. The coexistence of homogeneity and heterogeneity makes for respect of individuality and thus for ideas of equality. At this point we pass over into Bougle's most characteristic idea which he calls "social complication." Social comnplication refers to the member- ship of an individual in a large number of groups at the same time. By placing the human personality over against collec- tivity, a situation is created highly con- ducive to ideas of equality. As the gen- eral principle of equality tends to em- phasize larger unities so the individual is at the same time emancipated. Socie- ties which unify at the same time that they become mnore complicated, of which the units are assitnilated at the same time that they are distinguished from one an- other and concentrate at the same time that they multiply, such socieites open the mind to equality. It is interesting to notice that in Bougle's earliest book his entire system of sociology is clearly outlined. We recognize, for example, several features already mentioned in connection with Qu'est-ce que la Sociologie? All the later works and all the applications to practical problems are only elaborations of the above scheme. It is by no means origi- nal, as I shall try to show later. The author, in fact, mnakes no such claims but he has consistently and continuously defended the principles which it involves, to the present time. Perhaps the most imnposing of Bougle's works is La De'nocratie devant lo Science, I909, a critical study of heredity, com- petition and differentiation. No doubt the book was suggested by the author's intensive study of the evolutionary con- cept both in the natural and social sciences. If one may be permitted to rationalize, it looks as if Bougle had been deeply interested in biological analogies in society and had made up his mind to settle, once and for always their value as social criteria. The imnmediate inspira- tion of the book is the necessity for de- fending democracy, attacked on the ground of being unscientific or even op- posed to science. Selecting three fundamental scientific conceptions Bougle associates with them three sociological conceptions as follows: (I) heredity and the philosophy of races, called anthropo-sociology, (2) differenti- ation and the organic theory, (3) competi- tion and Social-Darwinism. Anthropo- sociology is the scientific apology for class, caste, aristocracy, bourgeoisie, no- tions of race primacy and destinly as deter- mined by ethnic quality. After a de- tailed sumumary of the progress and state of present opinion on the subject of biological heredity, Bougle concludes that there is no justification for any of the above notions on the basis of inheritance. The rule of class and caste is not founded on nature and democracy is not assailed by anthropo-sociology. On the positive side a definite point is gained. Democracy, in breaking down class barriers, takes precaution to utilize the natural capacities to better social advantage. The value of the organic analogy is next examined. Are democratic tendencies anti-biological because differentiation of organisms brings about the disappearance of the liberty and equality of their elements? In the first place, says Bougle, differentiation in nature is not a measure of perfection and</page><page sequence="7">14 SOCIAL FORCES evolution and progress are not necessarily synonymous. Differentiation by itself is useless, for cells bear resemblances to one another, and their coordination is in- creasingly important with specialization of function. Solidarity and differentia- tion are complementary. Differentiated organisms are not necessarily more vigor- ous, productive or plastic. In fact their chances of survival are diminished. To quote, "In vain we demand of science a objective criterion of progress, and in short, if naturalists wish to construct a strictly scientific biology free from all human prejudice, all anthropomorphism and consequently of all finalism, they ought to refrain from judging the creatures whose evolution they describe. More- over, from a totally mechanistic concep- tion of nature, one cannot derive a defini- tion of progress. That which breathes upon consciousness plunges all the values of the natural world into darkness, ob- scurity and indifference. The scientist must refrain from determnining rank" (De- mocratie devant la Science, p. I33). Differ- entiation loses its scientific prestige when applied to society as a measure of progress. It offers on the other hand a useful com- parison in certain cases. Bougle limits his discussion at this point to the analogy between differen- tiation of natural forms and differentia- tion of social forms in the division of labor. The general correspondence of the biological and sociological theories is supported by the fact that there are es- timated to be at Itast io,ooo different outlets for huinan activity in our modern society. To examine the situation in detail however, reveals fundamental con- trasts. In the first place, classic theory in political economy advanced the idea of the benefits of economic specialization. This narrow industrial view-point was borrowed by the biologists who enlarged it to include all activity. But the biologi- cal theorists do not hint at indispensable sociological distinctions, any more than Adam Smith did, namely the three entirely different types of division of labor; special- ization of professions, decomposition of operations and sectioning of production. Moreover there is a distinction between the technical aspect and the juridical aspect. Sociologists want to know not only in what social conditions a man works but also what laws affect his political and economic status. "It is important to render unto the machine that which belongs to the machine and to the law that which belongs to the law" (ibid., p. I44). Side by side with social differentiation but essentially distinct from it, individual differentiation takes place. Here the bio- logical analogy fails to instruct us in the evolution of societies. "In a word our civilization not only multiplies but over- laps its groups. It is this incessant over- lapping, this universal interpenetration which constitutes the distinctive phe- nomenon, teeming with novel conse- quences, which the analogy of the organ- ism has not prepared us to foresee" (ibid., p. I55). It is true of course, that differ- entiation and social complication are by no means unhindered. The social situa- tion, by means of property classes or a larger class-consciousness may obstruct the process. Yet, humanitarianism be- comes increasingly important and the life of the spirit receives a higher valuation. Such problems as are suggested here are not solved by dependence on biological teachings. Bougle's final conclusion is as follows: "The organic theory casts no light on the conditions of existence proper to our societies, nor their characteristic evolution, nor a fortiori, on their par- ticular ends" (ibid. p. i86). The social consequences of accepting</page><page sequence="8">CELESTIN BOUGLE Darwin's idea of a struggle for existence are next discussed. Is life a choice be- tween 'eat" or "be eaten"? Are struggle and war justified? Are these objective realities opposed to the subjective aspira- tions of democracy? Is competition in all its forms an indispensable instrument of progress? Bougle thinks that Darwin has been taken somewhat too literally in this matter of "struggle for existence," that he intended his words to imply only a general metaphor. As a matter of fact the destructive struggle for existence in nature is modified by passive and indirect struggle, by sexual selection where it obeys the esthetic impulse or exercises a choice, by symbiosis, mutual aid, asso- ciation, solidarity and consciousness of kind-''a reintegration," as it were, "of idealism in the heart of the evolutionary theory" (ibid., p. -o6). In addition, the struggle for existence among men is modi- fied by man's capacity as a tool maker. He does not adapt himself to the natural world but the natural world to himself. It is a useful thing to review the conditions peculiar to the human struggle for exist- ence, for man becomes entirely too humble when he forgets the difference which separates him from the animal, his su- perior capacity to adapt means to ends. Not only by the tool does civilization transform the struggle for existence but by every social means which retards, regulates or lightens it. Humanity gains control over itself as well as over nature. Humanitarianism is but the continuation of the social task to limit the effects of animal nature, shaping it to the faculties and tendencies of human nature. The proper evolution of society is to substitute rational intervention for spontaneous intervention. The relation of all this to democracy has become obvious. Democratic tenden- cies in their more profound interpretation are solidaristic. Responsibilities are in- volved as well as rights, a recognition of the part played by society in the creation of value as over against the individualistic explanation. The "fittest" who are ulti- mately to survive are those who strongest in body, mind and conscience, accept with alacrity all the duties of solidarity. The general conclusions of the whole book may be summarized as follows: There is an essential duality in human societies, the animal aspect and the social aspect, which is misunderstood by the naturalistic sociology. Science cannot prove democracy wrong. It cannot wholly prove it right. To understand society the social nature must be con- sidered. Biological sociology has done all it can. Its work is finished, and society may free itself from the naturalis- tic obsession. "No one has a right to discourage in the name of a pseudo-sci- entific ethic the ambitions of the spirit. Her voice is free" (Part III. Conclusion). It will be observed that La De6nocratie devant la Science although avowedly a defence of democracy, has a much wider implication. It is in general a challenge to all those who hold a biological con- ception of society. To the faith expres- sed in this book Bougle holds fast in all his writings. The subject of the division of labor which occupies such an important place in the above work, is treated at much greater length in an essay published in the volume entitled Qu'est-ce que la Sociologie? The general method of approach to the problem has already been made clear. Bougle now reviews the various theories of the division of labor from Adam Smith to Durkheim, throwing into relief the sociological significance of the principle in modern society. The gradual expan- sion of the conception from Adam Smith's narrow view to that of an analysis of all</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL FORCES human activity on the basis of speciliza- tion comprises the first part of the essay. There is an additional emphasis on the idea of the technical regimes, e.g., the domestic, urban, national and interna- tional economy, and on the legal situa- tions and political systems within which specialization takes place. Bougle ac- acords to Stammler the credit of having cleared up the confusion between the technical and the economic point of view. Steam has not transformed society by virtue of being a material force but because the force was appropriated by capital. Methods of production do not influence social action aside from codes but in ac- cordance with them. A truly sociological theory can be elaborated only when we have a complete picture of the systems (regimes) which cross the division of labor, to which it must submit and in accordance with which it operates. The causes of the division of labor are exchange, invention, diversity of aptitude, political and social institutions, economic rank, increased needs, volume and density of society. In fact "Division of labor varies in direct proportion to the volume and density of societies" (p. I49, quoted from Durkheim). The results of the division of labor are discussed at greater length. Opinion as to their value has ranged from the most optimistic to the most pessimistic conclusions. Saving of time, space, capital and apprenticeship are weighed against need for construction, unification and organization. It is in the intellectual, spiritual, artistic and scien- tific spheres of activity that the law works to a certain disadvantage. Automatically it stands in the way of a larger synthesis. The scientist's function for example, is Ilot to accumulate scattered truths but to reduce them to order. The synthetic mind is only too rare. This is bad for science because isolation means steriliza- tion. May this criterion be applied to industry? Yes, because the wider rela- tions of the industries to one another are neglected. They are not organized and economic anarchy results. Division of labor is even capable of overturning the world which it supports. Socialism sounds a warning here, as it also protests against man being made the appendage of a machine. It has been contended that the creation of classes is a result of the division of labor. Is this true? Is social speciliza- tion born of technical specialization? To take this position is to overlook other differences which help to form classes e.g. religious prestige, politics and eco- nomic power. In a sense, classes are an- terior to professional specialization. One does not belong to a class by virtue of his trade but he takes a trade by virtue of his class. It is true that unequal distribution of property interferes with free choice and all conditions are not ideal, but at the same time social complication acts as a modifying and emancipating principle. Moreover, as Durkheim points out, the true function of specialization is not to favor economic production but to bind men together more intimately. On the sociological side the normal function of the division of labor is a moral function. It involves a reciprocal consciousness of independence. This is a principle of the highest value in the progress of civiliza- tion. As homogeneity breaks down, a new principle of cohesion furnishes the points of dependence necessary to the moral life. Respect for the human per- sonality is made the center of the social morale. Essais sur le Regime des Castes, I908, is in some respects the most unusual of all Bougle's writings. It is an intensive study of the caste system in India, involv- ing a detailed knowledge of its actual</page><page sequence="10">CELESTIN BOUGLE operation, the literature of the subject and possibly some observation in India. The object in view is a sociological study, purely abstract in character, of an eco- nomic and social organization in a more or less stable condition. After a survey of the four great castes, priestly, military, comnmercial and indus- trial, the three distinctive characteristics of the system are stated as (I) hierarchy of the Brahmins, (z) mutual repulsion among the castes, (3) hereditary speciali- zation of occupations. An attempt is then made to explain its origin, with all these features in view. Is a caste only a guild petrified? If this were wholly true, it would constitute an unexpected con- firmation of the materialistic philosophy of history, a rising scale of caste propor- tionate to the utility and difficulty of the occupation which it carries on, each group of castes corresponding to a stage of prog- ress by which humanity increases its power over things. But the explanation proves inadequate to the problems of hereditary function and mutual repulsion. The theory of origin in family or clan may explain the system in a wide and general sense, pointing to the feature of isolation and to the common spirit and religious scruples of kinship groups that have survived within it. Brahmin pri- macy, supported neither by political power, nor material wealth, nor clerical organization, nor common dogma, nor missionary enterprise is explicable only on the basis of the priestly function. In Lhe act of sacrifice the priest partakes of the essence of those gods with whom he places men in communication. Durk- heim's theory of the preponderating in- fluence of religion in primitive life is il- lustrated and supported in a situation which survives in India but has long since disappeared in civilizations further advanced. The caste system has survived success. fully the political and religious changes of Indian history. Inorganic, supple, plas- tic and adaptable, obedience to caste rule is its only requirement. Ideas of equality in the Buddhist system have been ineffective because its essentially pes- simistic and negative characteristics have actually strengthened the caste idea. Feudalism and monarchy have passed over its surface without altering its funda- mental stability. Will it survive British rule? So far the effect has been to increase the number of minor castes to accom- mnodate the new functions introduced, while the mechanism remains intact. The locomotive hailed by some as a destroyer of caste, has spread and strength- ened the caste idea. Hostility to foreign rule has had a certain unifying effect. In connection with this discussion, Bougle makes a profound observation regarding the actual influence exerted by the occident on oriental civilizations. "From all the outward manifestations of European civilization, the ancient oriental civilizations are appropriating that which serves themselves in order to protect them- selves. They are changing only the bodily formn in order the better to safe- guard the soul" (ibid., p. I27). Bougle next considers the theories of those who relate caste differences to race differences, but he finds the statistical studies which have been made, useless and the theories undemonstrable and im- probable. This conclusion may be related to his views on anthroposociology as set forth in La De'mocratie devant la Science. The relation of caste to law among the Hindoos is referred to the influence of religious ideas. Fouillee's "idees-forces" are, so far as the Hindoos are concerned, the theories of Manu. Law arising in religion has not yet become emancipated from it. Tlle secularization of law has never been achieved because India lacks even the rudinments of a state and ulti-</page><page sequence="11">i8 SOCIAL FORCES mately the city as a political unit, a me- dium by which to evolve a political existence. To-day, a caste law built on ancestral authority, is allowed to func- tion within a larger unity of dominant Aryan tradition, interpreted by the Brahmins. The relation of caste to economic life is perhaps the one most familiar to western students and need not be expanded here. Bougle traces the effect of the system upon production and consumption in a most fascinating way. As in religion and in law, so in the economic order India is in a state of arrested development. A final chapter on caste as reflected in Indian literature completes the book. While this book is essentially an aca- demic study undertaken evidently without motives of propaganda, or in the interest of any sociological theory, it affords an illustration on a tremendous scale of the overwhelmning influence of social forms on the individual. Whether this is really the point of the book or not, it is intensely interesting and very readable. Change of scene to foreign lands, in sociology as in every day life, is a refreshing as well as an emancipating mental experience. The last of Bougle's longer works ap- peared in i9z2. "Lecons de Sociologie sur l'Evolution de Valeurs" is a summary of a course of lectures given at the Sor- bonne for prospective teachers. It is a study in the origins and evolution of religion, ethics, science and art, or to put it in another way, a study of the different forms of the ideal and their relation to society and institutions. "We recognize" says the author, "and discover here the donminant thought of the sociological work of iEmile Durkheim. His last writ- ings are full of this idea. Society is es- sentially the creator of an ideal" (p. i5). This book may therefor be regarded as an illustration of Durkheim's social psych- ology so far as emphasis is placed on the collective origin of ideals, and moreover an illustration of his theory of the reli- gious nature of social origins, so far as moral, scientific, rational and artistic values are traced to that common source. It is tempting to linger over the pages of this book, especially that part of it which is devoted to the evolution of rational thought, by the exploration of nature involved in primitive magic, and the latter emancipation of scientific no- tions from religion. Then comes a warn- ing. Are science and the work of pure reason, once obstructed by religion, to be made dependent on industry? "Let us rescue Minerva from Vulcan by recogniz- ing that reason conquers only when in a state of absolute independence" (p. zz4). But we must pass on to the theoretical analysis. In the evolution of values we are to observe an increasing differentiation, the dispersive character of which is modified by a principle which Bougle calls "poly- telism." Polytelism means the coexis- tence of diverse ends in the same value. An educational system for example, may be supported by many persons for different reasons because it provides different satis- factions for each of them. The same value is justified from different points of view. This is of course only another way of looking at social complication, Bougle's guiding principle of synthesis in all social problems. Overlapping of values like overlapping of the groups which esteem them, creates tolerance and the sense of mutual need. An organic solidarity is built upon diversities instead of a me- chanical solidarity built on resemblances. So the group which fosters a given ideal is enlarged and when civilization is to be guarded it crosses the natural boundary. "Interpenetrations are the rule because the expansion of values is one of the ten- dencies of history" (p. z274). The pos- sibility of universalization becomes one of the criteria of value itself,</page></plain_text>
