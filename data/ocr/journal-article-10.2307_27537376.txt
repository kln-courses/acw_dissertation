<plain_text><page sequence="1">by Arthur Mizener SOME NOTES ON THE NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY This is an art Which does mend nature?change it rather; but The art itself is nature. THAT the Nineteenth Century should be, for the textbook understanding, the century of nature poetry is ironic, even if you allow for the fact that the contemporary mind has a hard time extending the word nature beyond the limited sense of rocks, and stones, and trees. For of all the periods of English literature, the Nineteenth Century was most thoroughly embarrassed by both nature and the supernatural (the two are inseparable in this context, as the diametric opposition of the older and newer senses of the word nature clearly indicates). Its preoccupation with the subject was the preoccupation of the man who has got hold of the tiger's tail. This is not, to be sure, a position in which it is easy to look dignified, though the Twentieth Century's con centration on the ludicrousness of the Nineteenth Century's efforts in this direction is not very intelligent. We laugh because we have lost our sense of the need for dignity, and perhaps even our sense of danger, rather than because we have found solid ground, for it is still the case with us that between the ends of distraction Waits mute speculation, the patient curse That stones the eyes, or like the jaguar leaps For his own image in a jungle pool, his victim. The Renaissance poets on the other hand, were as nearly free from the Nineteenth Century's embarrassment as is probably desirable; it is even arguable that some of them found it too easy to "mythologize indiscriminately history, legend, trees, the sea, animals, all being humanly dramatized, somehow converted to</page><page sequence="2">28 by ARTHUR MIZENER the nature of man." They were able to mythologize in this way because they still had the conviction of their past to support their notion of how the natural and the human fitted into a scheme created by a personal divinity. From] very early in its career, however, English literature had been able, like good Catholics making bawdy jokes about holy things, to make the qualifying naturalistic observation about physical nature. The Second Shepherd's Play contains such a joke, but the effect of the qualifi cation in even so powerfully naturalistic a case as this one is to strengthen the initial conviction. And since it seldom occurred to people of the Renaissance that such a qualification might be the fundamental truth of the matter, they tended to conceive even the naturalistic qualification of their "poetic" view of the universe in terms determined by that view, that is, in essentially anthropomorphic terms. Spenser's Mutabilitie is a person; and the conviction about the nature of things which lies behind this procedure is, as Mr. Lewis has remarked, overt in the Mutabilitie Cantos where "behind the endless contention [of Change and Permanence] arises the deeper truth?that Change is but the mode in which Permanence ex presses itself, that Reality 'is ?terne in mutabilitie.' " A similar conviction lies behind the fact that Doctor Faustus is not a hu manitarian materialist dependent on the powers of thinly dis guised concepts called Spirits Sinister or Spirits Ironic; he is a practitioner of black magic and a friend of Mephistophilis. For by the time Elizabethan drama has come of age, there are no allegorically embodied concepts any more than there are natural istic characters. The medieval Mankind has become Hamlet, as The World has become Claudius, The Flesh Falstaff and The Devil lago. Nor was it any simple allegorical Machiavelli who made that grim joke about having flown the Alps and, "now the Guise is dead," come from France "To view this land and frolic with his friends." As for the naturalistic characters, if the Mach iavels like Lorenzo and lago are ostensibly purely natural per sons, they cannot for a moment be mistaken for simple ration alists operating in a naturalistic world; for the Elizabethan</page><page sequence="3">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_29 imagination could not avoid surrounding their successes with an air of almost literally diabolical skill or putting into their mouths a conviction of their own evil as irrational and shocking as it is superb. "To the people who told these stories," as Miss Hamil ton has remarked in another connection, "all the universe was alive with the same kind of life they knew in themselves." It is perhaps easier to see the result of this kind of thinking in the case of the simple comparison of man with the super natural than in the more complicated cases and I will begin with it. The typical Elizabethan handling of this comparison is Romeo and Juliet. Romeo's comparison of Juliet to a saint is a fairly conventional instance of a familiar comparison which was saved from becoming mjerely emotive and hollow hyperbole by the Elizabethan assurance of the literal reality of saints and their feeling that the superiority of the saint in her kind and the superiority of Juliet in hers were intimately related. Shakes peare's use of this comparison is remarkable for its time, in so far as it is remarkable mainly because the characters involved are not merely stock instances of the comparison but defined characters with a certain lifelike independence from their duties as symbols and thus capable in their own right of seeing the incongruous and ironic aspects of the comparison ("you kiss by th' book"). The qualification of this metaphor is Mercutio's bawdy and naturalistic conjuring. Mercutio's metaphor is from magic instead of from religion, which, in the light of Doctor Faustus and Friar Bacon's experience, is probably sufficient quali fication in itself. But Mercutio's joke goes further; it makes the assumption that man's real "spirit" is his sex; and Mercutio's speech is full of the details of the art of conjuring more to sug gest how convincingly it may be reduced to sex than to suggest that sex is the material manifestation of a powerful spirit. This is the qualifying naturalistic observation on the love of Romeo and Juliet, but no one has ever supposed it seriously endangered the initial conviction of the play. Mercutio is recog nizably the younger brother of Thersites, but he has always passed for an amusing fellow because in the context of the play</page><page sequence="4">30 by ARTHUR MIZENER his talk is bound to appear incurably frivolous, and frequently his own actions belie his talk and sometimes his talk itself does. For not even Mercutio's imagination has been completely cor rupted by his naturalism as Thersites' imagination has been. His qualification has weight, certainly, and he dies cursing the idealistic and, to him, irrelevant nonsense in supporting which he has been killed. Nevertheless, for all of this qualification, the play firmly supports the initial conception of human love and Romeo and Juliet go, like martyred saints, to their star-lit lovers' heaven out of the garish, sun-lit world of the nurse and Mercutio, who jest at scars that never felt a wound. The firm ness with which Romeo and Juliet asserts the validity of this comparison between human and divine love is in striking contrast to the herculean effort it costs Antony and Cleopatra to make a similar assertion. The weight of the naturalistic view has become much greater in the latter play. II Historically speaking, what is most interesting to watch is the way the emphasis gradually shifted. With the early Elizabethans the emphasis was mainly on the fundamental similarity of the life of man, nature, and the supernatural. The early Elizabethans retained their predecessors' vivid sense of the reality of ethical abstractions, and as a consequence the immediately human tended to enter their poetry mainly as the mpre or less conventionalized vehicle for these abstractions, as personification. For them nature was on much the same footing in this respect as humanity and, under the pressure of classical mythology and the French and Italian uses of elaborate figurative language, they tended to personify the abstract forces of nature with the same facility with which they applied personification to ethical abstractions. It is more often than not the case in their poetry that the ethical personification is Christian while the nature to which it is com pared is given a Pagan personification; indeed, examples can be found of almost every possible combination of these ingredients.</page><page sequence="5">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_31 In spite of a marked tendency to become more specific and concrete about the human?as in the use of historical characters in The Mirror for Magistrates (where the characters are, in addition, types rather than personifications)?and to stress thek medieval delight in the details of physical nature as such?as in the opening stanzas of Sackville's Induction?the abstraction re mained sufficiently in the foreground of the early Elizabethan's minds to prevent their being troubled by the clash between Pagan and Christian persons at the level of personification, as Milton was. The sentence Mr. Renwick quotes from, Ronsard is typical of the current understanding of the situation: "The Muses, Apollo, Mercury, Pallas, and other such deities represent to us nothing more than the powers of God, to Whom the first men gave several names for the divers effects of His incomparable Majesty." The habit of applying the names of the classical gods to Christian figures is a logical extension of this view; E. K. (gloss for May, I. 54) is typical: i(Great Pan is Christ. . . . The name is most rightly (me thinkes) applyed to him, for Pan signi fieth all, or omnipotent, etc." Milton, of course, used a variation of this procedure to get the world of classical mythology into Paradise Lost. Spenser's incomparable gift for detailed elaboration was devoted to a mixture of this kind: At last the golden Orientall gate Of greatest heauen gan to open faire, And Phoebus fresh, as bridegrome to his mate, Came dauncing forth, shaking his dea wie haire: And hurled his glistring beames through gloomy aire. Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiu'd streight way He started vp, and did him selfe prepaire, In sun-bright armes, and battailous array;: For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day. There is a nice fusion, if, to our tastes, not a complete ordering, of Pagan and Christian elements here. Phoebus, fresh as the Psalmist's bridegroom, comes dancing (with, I suppose, both a pagan grace and the rejoicing of a strong man to run a race) from the gate of a heaven which is actually felt simultaneously in terms of the clear and lovely classical fantasy on nature and in</page><page sequence="6">32 by ARTHUR MIZENER terms of a Christian vision of the metaphysical source of the meaning of life. It is not easy to imagine what Dr. Johnson would have made of such "impious equivocation" had he felt called upon to take it as seriously as it must surely have been meant; and Spenser has not made matters simpler for critics like him by bringing the whole account of Phoebus to bear on the arming of Holiness "in sun-bright armes" for the combat with the "Pagan" Sansjoy. The point here is, I think, that the general connection of the life of mjan and the life of nature which supports the initial act of personification is unquestionable; and Spenser is sufficiently preoccupied with the Red Cross Knight and Sansjoy as ethical abstractions and with Phoebus as an abstraction from nature so that, with the help of the devices of his day for subordinating mythology and romance to Christian doctrine, he was able to escape any feeling of conflict at the level of personification. Phoe bus is light, one of the major symbols, not only for Spenser but for almost all poetry?Shakespeare is a curious partial exception ?for life, good (compare, for example, The Faerie Queene, 3. 2. 24) ; that he was as a person pagan and at this level more "nat urally" to be associated with the "Pagan proud" is irrelevant for Spenser, for it is not at this level that he is being natural. A better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas indeed; for, with certain modifications, Milton's poetry works in this same way. This ultimate dependence for order on the abstract ideas be cause they were Nature is far, however, from diminishing Spen ser's acute awareness of Phoebus' personal characteristics; it was, in fact, the easier for him to take account of them just because he was less responsible at this level, did not, that is, have to give a significance to every detail. This was official doctrine: "Not all things which are feigned in figures are to be thought to have significance; for many things are added, along with those that have significance, for the sake of order and connexion." Spenser uses this principle in his metaphors as freely as he does in his allegory, about which he himself remiarked that "by occasion hereof many other adventures are intermeddled; but rather as</page><page sequence="7">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_33 Accidents than intendments." In all probability it is only ages which are uncertain about the great underlying correspondences which cultivate the practice of demonstrating a correspondence in every minute particular; certainly it is such ages which are likely to breed the kind of poetry which forgets Nature and, by accepting what is feigned literally, end by substituting the natural istic for Nature. This is not to say that any kind of "intermeddle ment" will do. There is a firm grasp of the fact of the sunrise in Spenser's stanza and a clear picture of Apollo. It is these which prevent the vehicle of the metaphor from failing as a result of the difficulty of visualizing the sun with dew on it?the Player King does a little better at this point: "The instant burst of clamour that she made/. . . Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven/And passion in the gods"?or of imagining anyone occupied to so little purpose as Apollo is. (I do not mean to pretend not to see that this is Light routing Darkness; the loose ness consists in Light's being personified and the "gloomy aire's" not being.) I do not know if all the details of this personification may justly be thought of as carrying over to the comparison of the Red Cross Knight to Apollo. Certainly the Red Cross Knight's "sun-bright armes" ("the armour of a Christian man") are intended to be compared to the "glistring beames" with which Apollo attacks the darkness, as the virtuous and enlightened Elf is about to attack the darkly evil Pagan. And it is tempting to suppose that since the strength of Holiness is that of the sun, of "the god unshorn," the references to Apollo's hair and to the bridegroom's energy are also significant. If they are, Spenser's use of this comparison is even closer to the uses made of it by Raleigh, Shakespeare, Herrick, Milton, and Pope, which are re ferred to below, than this essay has dared to suppose. In any event, Spenser certainly gained a good deal by making the resources of mythology and romance available to ethical allegory in this way. The risk he ran was, of course, that in such a serious discourse the incongruity among the persons or between the personification and its significance might defeat the intention. What saved Spenser was his power of holding, through</page><page sequence="8">34 by ARTHUR MIZENER any confusion of comparisons, to the one or two things which will preserve a kind of order among them and his power of focusing the serious attention on the significance rather than on the personification. It is the assumption of this essay that the conception of reality in the end determines the poet's conception of language, that the style is, not so much the man, as his world. There is an evident connection between the two in Spenser, in any event, for exactly as he found a way to control the multiplicity of his comparisons, so he felt that Nature found a way to control Mutabilitie. It is surely significant that by the end of the tradition of which Spenser was the first wholly great poet, this impertinent female had become a tigerish Spenserian monster, a "Nature red in tooth and claw," to which Tennyson's heart played the pathetic and ineffectual Saint George. Such she remains today, as the pas sage quoted from Mr. T?te in the first paragraph of this essay implies. The danger of Spenser's eclectic method of making figures, for poetry in general, is that it encourages poets to think they can safely do anything, or even nothing, with metaphor: Milton had a not dissimilar effect on certain Eighteenth Century poets. Peele, for example, reduces Spenser to what I suspect is something worse than nonsense. His adaption of Spenser's personification in the following passage is either meaningless decoration or else the application of it to an abstraction (conquest) so inadequately conceived as to suggest an anarchic conception of metaphor. The extremely casual but still vaguely m'eaningful use of "crown'd" and the peculiar way the bridegroom has gone astray make you suspect the latter: As when the sun attir'd in glistering robe, Comes dancing from his oriental gate, And bridegroom-like hurls through the gloomy air His radiant beams, such doth king David show, Crown'd with the honour of his enemies' town. . . . In later Elizabethan and Jacobean poetry, the emphasis shifts gradually in the direction of the naturalistic view of the universe until the two views reach that terrible balance of authority which Shakespeare forced Troilus to look on in the flesh:</page><page sequence="9">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_35 0 madness of discourse, That cause sets up with and against itself! Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt Without perdition, and loss assume all reason Without revolt: this is and is not Cressid! This state of mind was the turning point, though chronologically speaking Shakespeare perhaps anticipated its general arrival. From this point on the weight of conviction falls more and more heavily on the side of what Troilus calls "beauty" and less and less heavily on the side of what he calls "soul," and his thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth; And yet the spacious breadth of this division Admits no orifex for a point as subtle As Ariachne's broken woof to enter. For a long time an intense awareness of this problem's reality endured, in spite of the growing predominance of the naturalistic view, and one can trace this awareness in those for whom the authority was, at least ostensibly, no longer bi-fold through Rochester and the Restoration dramatists to the end of the Eight eenth Century and even, at least in their poignant sense of its loss, to such Nineteenth Century poets as Matthew Arnold. For to have loss assume all reason is a very different thing from the disappearance of a sense of loss. Like the supernatural comparisons such as that of Juliet and the saint, the comparisons drawn from nature, which are so fre quent in the Elizabethan plays of the nineties, depend for their relevance on the conviction that these two kinds of life, the life of man and the life of nature, are fundamentally the same. Thus Lennox's advice to the men about to attack Macbeth, that they pour so much [blood] as it needs To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds, is apparently not even felt as wit, in spite of the?to us?ex tremely remote analogy between human good and evil (both individual and social: the play on sovereign brings in the divine right of kings and the whole social system built around it) and the natural "good and evil" in the flower and the weeds. This</page><page sequence="10">36 by ARTHUR MIZENER goes on everywhere in Shakespeare. And if there is a certain air of wit about Raleigh's serious use of this same kind of com parison, its source is rather practical than metaphysical (this is Mr. Empson's passage) : So could she not, if she were not the sun . . . Knowing she can renew, and can create Green from the ground, and flowers, even out of stone, By virtue lasting over time and date, Leaving us only woe, which like the moss, Having compassion of unburied bones, Cleaves to mischance, and unrepaired loss. . . . This is a particularly fine example of the "poetic" view: by making Elizabeth the sun with its life-giving power, Raleigh makes her God. This is the full use, in a very clear form, of the unifying comparison which this view makes available. Ill The wit of the metaphysical poets, which endured in one form or another through the Eighteenth Century, is, in this respect, a kind of casuistry made necessary by the weight of the natural istic qualification in their minds, by their serious doubts of the validity of the traditional conception of the natural and super natural context of man's life which earlier writers had taken for granted. Donne's characteristic use of the comparison between the lady and the saint or angel is revealing: Yet I thought thee ?For thou lovest truth?an angel, at first sight; But when I saw thou saw'st my heart, And knew'st my thoughts beyond an angel's art, When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when Excess of joy would wake me, and earnest then, I must confess, it could not choose but be Profane, to think thee anything but thee. This is surely a shaken use of the comparison; in two crucial places, in the fourth and last lines, Donne is asking us to take very seriously indeed what Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet asks us to take mainly as a joke. So far indeed, has Donne pushed the naturalistic qualification that his use of the stock comparison</page><page sequence="11">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_37 may appear at first glace to be like the Eighteenth Century mock heroic?"Say why are beauties prais'd and honour'd most,/ . . . Why angels call'd and angel-like ador'd?"?and can even be mistaken for the merely elegant euphemism of romantic fiction. It is neither of these, of course, for Donne's angel is no mere euphemism but a reality, and a reality importunate enough to keep the fourth and last lines nearer serious hyperbole than ironic statement of fact. The pressure the stock comparison is bearing here is nonetheless very great. "For thou lovest truth": I apol ogize for having even momentarily thought you a being so lacking in the final and most valuable reality. "I must confess": I con fess to you, as I might to God, that it was profane of me to confuse you with so inferior a being as an angel. A simple case from one of the less serious courtly poets will indicate how this kind of casuistry worked out so far as nature was concerned: Sweet, be not proud of those two eyes Which, starlike, sparkle in their skies . . . Whenas that ruby which you wear, Sunk from the tip of your soft ear, Will last to be a precious stone When all your world of beauty's gone. This is a very different use of the deadness of stone from Ral eigh's. Raleigh's use is, I think, the characteristic one for his age ("Who moving others are themselves as stone"). It might be that only God could make life flow from a stone, as Queen Elizabeth, in the capacity of God's deputy, might have, as Moses, in the same capacity, did; nevertheless it had the capacity for life: neither Raleigh, Shakespeare, nor Moses thought it futile to pray that life might come from stone. In Herrick's poem, however, it is no accident that the sparkling of the ruby should suggest that all sparkling things of the physical universe, including the stars, have a hard, inanimate preciousness which is essentially different from' the starlike, soft and human preciousness of her eyes. It is this same suspicion of an essential difference between the hu man and the natural which produces the ingenuity of "their skies," which is so careful not to identify the separate spheres</page><page sequence="12">38 by ARTHUR MIZENER of stars and eyes. The wit here is almost an apology, a dis claimer of any intention of seriously comparing the two spheres, very like, in its motivation, the Eighteenth Century's theoretical insistence that similes were only illustrations and not seriously intended. It brings Herrick recognizably closer to Bright star would I were stedfast as thou art? Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night . . . which is not an "interinanimating" comparison at all. I suppose this may have something to do with the tendency of romantic readers to exaggerate Herrick's importance at the expense of better metaphysical poets. This same carefully hedged dependence on the validity of the analogy is present in Milton in a more complex way. Where the metaphysical poet asserts the comparison boldly, so boldly as to put the wary reader on his guard for the denials of it which are hinted at, Milton bluntly denies a whole range of its implica tions. This looks like the strategic retreat to shorten the lines of defense which is evident in Doctor Johnson. In fact, however, these implications which are ostensibly denied are, in Milton, reasserted by the only apparent confusion and irrelevance of his syntax and figurative language. The apparent narrowness and firmness of Milton's direct statements are in general deceptive enough: Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry] Jove Sheer o'er the Crystal Battlements: from Morn To Moon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, A Summer's day; and with the setting Sun Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, On Lemnos th' JEg an Isle: thus they relate, Erring; . . . It is easy enough, after this, to suppose Milton is discarding the whole fable as erroneous. But in fact all he says is that the details of time and place in this account are fabulous and in error, not the essential facts. Mulciber is only a mistaken or alternate name for Mammon, and Mammon is as real as any person in Paradise Lost:</page><page sequence="13">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_39 Erring; for he with his rebellious route Fell long before. This tale about Mulciber is not, then, a mere fable which acci dentally parallels the true story of Mamon and the other fallen angels; it is an essentially true account, confused only in details. Milton's casual appearance of denying the whole story is a kind of deception. Moreover, it is impossible to say just where the falseness of the pagan version, in Milton's opinion, begins. In fact, Milton's account of it is such that it is impossible to say surely that any of it is false. Milton sounds as if he were downright impatient with all this nonsense about Mulciber; as if it were not his doing that this account got into Paradise Lost nor his fault that Mulciber's fall is so beautifully and convincingly detailed. The reader may ac cept this disclaimer, as the Eighteenth Century felt bound to, in order to save Milton from the charge of impiety: "but here [such equivocations] are indecent, and at least approach to im piety, of which, however, I believe the writer not to have been conscious." But this is to preserve Milton's piety, Eighteenth Century style, at the cost of his poetry; it is a far more damag ing defense than Bentley's fictitious reviser, whom Bentley con fessed, according to Doctor Johnson's indignant report, not to be lieve in. In order to sustain such a defense, one must suppose Milton to have been as uneconomical a user of nature as his late Eighteenth Century imitators like Thomas Warton and as casual a confuser of Jove and God as any careless user of "dic tion." For according to this defense, Milton's substitution of Heaven with its crystal battlements for Olympus must be merely for the sake of insignificant elegance (or is Heaven a fable too?). Yet surely what we have here is the Spenserian combination of classical and Christian heavens with the additional complication that Milton has worked in, as he does everywhere in Paradise Lost, a "scientific"?though to be sure conservative and Ptolemaic ?account of the universe to satisfy the "scientific" prejudice of his day. According to this defense, too, it must be only grammatical carelessness that the latter part of the sentence tends to say, 3</page><page sequence="14">40 by ARTHUR MIZENER not that they fabled how Mulciber fell and dropped on Lemnos, but that he did fall and drop there, dying with the lovely summer day, dropping liking the autumn evening's falling star. The very great extent to which Milton is still committed to this basic comparison of the lives of man, nature and the supernat ural is, in fact, frequently clear enough: nor appear'd Less than Arch Angel ruin'd, and th' excess Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris^n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclipse disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarchs. By the first of these sun comparisons the archangel ruined is the sun deprived of its power to dispel with its beams the foul mists of winter and make the earth fruitful once more; the fallen angel is Apollo, shorn. This is an exceedingly impious equivocation, since it makes Satan, before his fall, "the god unshorn." Nor is it easy to believe the epithet is insignificant here; with all his learning Milton must certainly have known how common a sym bol of virility the hair was among the Greeks. Herrick, a much less learned man, knew this, as his use of it in "Corinna's Going A-maying" clearly shows: Get up, get up, for shame, the blooming morn Upon her wings presents the god unshorn. The second comparison makes a more Elizabethan use of the analogy between the life of man and the life of nature; it is much the same use Shakespeare makes of the eclipse in Macbeth and goes very well so far as God's obscuring of Satan's original glory portends disaster precisely as God's obscuring of the sun was thought to. The trouble begins with the perplexed monarchs, for unless one is willing to suppose the changes in government which the archangel's eclipse portends good, one must suppose that Milton sympathizes with the perplexed monarchs' fear of change. It is not an easy thing to suppose, either way, for there are Milton's stated views of Satan's wickedness on the one hand and there are his notorious political opinions on the other. Yet</page><page sequence="15">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_41 Milton did not have to bring in these perplexed monarchs; they are his own deliberate choice of an example of the kind of dis asters eclipses portend. Tomkyns, Charles IPs licenser of the press, objected to this passage and it is customary for editors to take a very high tone with him, pointing to Milton's denials of any belief in astrology in his prose writings. But denials like this are scarcely final with a mind like Milton's and Tomkyns had a better case than the editors usually recognize. All this makes the part of Milton's mind which is at work in the poem's figurative language a supporter of the divine right of kings as well as some one for whom heaven was popluated by Apollo and the rest of the old pagan gods. And this is a kind of extension of that subtle and persistent tendency in the poem to make God an absolute mon arch curiously like Charles I and Satan a rebel against tyranny. Milton's was not a simple mind, and in one way and another he managed to get most of it into Paradise Lost. Thus Milton, like the rest of the century, despite his inability to accept openly the full implications of the traditional analogy between man, nature, and the supernatural, succeeded in pre serving them by a kind of wonderful deception (perhaps he was, in some senses, a victim of it himself), so that beneath all the qualification his poetry too is founded on that analogy. This reliance is certainly no part of his stated intention. The Christ ian flank having been turned by the pagan and rationalist out look of the day, Milton retired to the defenses of theology and set out to justify the ways of God to men rationally, precisely as James I, when the divinity of kings came under fire from the same quarter, undertook a logical proof of that divinity. Milton's trick of not letting the right hand of argument know what the left hand of simile and metaphor is doing turned out to be a dangerous pre cedent: the metaphysicals offered a much safer procedure. But this is not to say that in Milton the left hand is ever really un occupied. It is the metaphysical procedure, in any event, which the main line of English poetry followed for the next hundred years or more. The irony which Donne's struggle with the "commonsense,"</page><page sequence="16">42_by ARTHUR MIZENER naturalistic view of nature and the supernatural induced in his poetry became the mock heroic and the satiric by the Eighteenth Century, when the commonsense view constituted the whole ostensible content of the poetry. Theoretically the Eighteenth Century held that metaphors and similes are merely illustrations, to be avoided in serious discourse. To Doctor Johnson, for example, Shakespeare's puns were "what luminous vapours are to the traveller . . . sure to lead him out of the way, and sure to engulf him in the mire." Ostensibly Doctor Johnson's travel ler in the horse pond is Mrs. Hardcastle, not Stephano; that is to say, merely a fanciful descriptive illustration, not a comparison based on the fundamental similarity and constant interaction of the life of man and the life of nature (for in Shaksepeare's case, as Ferdinand had suffered his sea-change, so did Stephano his? "F th' filthy mantled pool"). Yet this metaphorical description of figurative language was pursued with a curious insistence, as if it somehow mattered, by those who thought like Doctor John son: Which yet make these retreats [the resort of the schoolmen to obscure language] more like the dens of robbers, or holes of foxes, than the fortresses of fair warriors: which if it be hard to get themj out of, it is not for the strength that is in them, but the briers and thorns, and the obscurity of the thickets they are beset with. For untruth being unacceptable to the mind of man, there is no other defense left for ab surdity but obscurity. In any event, this was the Eighteenth Century's theoretical conception of the matter, endorsed, as usual, by Pope in one of those neat similes of his: But true expression, like th' unchanging Sun, Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon; It gilds all objects, but it alters none. This is more like Seventeenth Century poetry than we ordinarily bother to remember, perhaps because its likeness appears to be mainly a habit of expression. Pope still has the Seventeenth Cen tury's habit of keeping these things straight, of having similes say something, and something that he means. This simile plainly</page><page sequence="17">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_43 means what its verbs say: "Clears and improves . . . gilds but alters . . . none." All these things are just as true, if not truer, about the sun's relation to what it shines on as they are about expression's relation to what it expresses. There is a history of Eighteenth Century natural science and Eighteenth Century metaphysics behind his simile. And if it is true that commonsense observation detects nothing, when the sun shines on an Eighteenth Century prospect, except an improved clarity and, at best, a Claude-like gilding, it is not likely that such observation will detect any less mechanical a relation between the hard kernel of observed fact and reasoned knowledge and the expression given to it. No wonder Eighteenth Century theory conceived of simile as illustration. Yet it is impossible to explain "the justness," as his age called it, of Pope's similes, the loving care with which he elaborated and made precise the details of a comparison, unless it be on the assumption that the vehicle of his metaphor was as important a part of the statement as the tenor; unless, in short, there was, in the Eighteenth Century, a kind of unconscious conviction that the relationship between tenor and vehicle was something more than the relationship between idea and illustration, was in some way both objective and organic. It was typical of Seventeenth Century poetry?that "glaring chaos and wild heap of wit"? to be intensely conscious not only of the relationship within na ture which Pope ignores but of the living relationship between nature and man. Thus both Raleigh and Shakespeare noticed that the sun alters every object it touches, not infrequently for the worse as well as for the better, and noticed, too, that there is a sense in which to observe this fact of nature is to observe something about the life of man: but it is I That, lying by the violet in the sun, Do as the carrion does, not as the flower, Corrupt with virtuous season. It is Pope's indirect dependence on this older view which makes for that habit of expression in his poetry so reminiscent of the</page><page sequence="18">44 by ARTHUR MIZENER Seventeenth Century. Perhaps it was his clearer understanding of this matter which made Doctor Johnson protest against Pope's more famous definition of wit, that it made wit a matter of expression rather than of thought. For with all his impatience of nymphs and shepherds and occasional gods?those relations between the life of man and nature and the supernatural in which he could not believe?Doctor Johnson had a strong sense of the importance of that narrowed range of relations among them which he did believe in: it was his strength. Pope had, in his poetry, the strength of his indirectness, a matter of almost perfect tact, rather than a belligerent narrowness. This strength is most evident in Pope's use of the mock heroic. The specific instance is obvious; for there is no point at all in the following mock heroic comparison of Belinda to the sun unless the serious heroic comparison which it is mocking still had some life in it: Smooth flowed the waves, the zephyrs gently play, Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay. Pope's tact here centers, of course, in the word world. Belinda smiles at the beau monde and it is gay, and she joins with the smooth waves and the gentle zephyrs to make the natural world gay: she is the sun. This is clear enough. But the ultimate point which makes Pope's poem a great one and not just a clever one, the point on which the mockery depends, will hardly be clear unless the reader is aware of the older view of the relation of the life of man and the life of nature. For this ultimate point is the deification of Belinda. Pope is saying in his indirect way what Raleigh has said so directly: So could she not, if she were not the sun . . . Knowing she can renew, and can create Green from the ground, and flowers, even out of stone. . . . It was this indirect use of the comparison, so very like Her rick's use ("When all your world of beauty's gone"), if even more completely hedged, which Arnold failed to understand and failing, said, in that unfortunate terminology of his, that Pope's</page><page sequence="19">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_Jo poetry was not written in the heart. This kind of failure comes very close, I think, to being what Dryden and Pope were talk ing about when they spoke of Dullness, and for them Dullness was very nearly identical with evil: at least, it was the mock heroic's persona for evil. For to miss what the Dull missed, in literature and life, was to miss the essential meaning of both, since the basic jest of the mock heroic is the solemn pretense that the limited conditions of its "hero" or "heroine's" life are the con ditions of life as a whole. The Eighteenth Century could scarcely use the word world without this kind of mockery "by which word world'3 says Tristram Shandy, "need I in this place inform your worship, that I would be understood to mean no more of it, than a small circle ... of four English miles diameter, or there abouts. . . ?" It is this kind of detailed implication of a larger and heroic life in every line which gives Pope's poems their greatness. That the conditions were such as to demand this tactful in directness is proved by the relative failure of the Eighteenth Century epic. The old view of things would not stand any more weight than Pope's indirection put on it; the direct statement of it was, for his age, both unnatural and unhuman. Doctor Johnson was as usual both clear and firm on this point: To select a singular event, and swell it to a giant's bulk by fabulous appendages of spectres and predictions, has little difficulty; for he that forsakes the probable may always find the marvellous. And it has little use: we are affected only as we believe; we are improved only as we find something to imitate or decline. Perhaps the modern reader may feel there is a little overcon fidence here, an insufficient sense of the impoverishment, in respect to that "essentially vital" power as Coleridge called the imagination, of a belief which dispenses too freely with "spectres and predictions." But Doctor Johnson was so sure that "Provi dence gives the power, of which reason teaches the use," that he never suspected reason might find it impossible to stop short of Providence itself. The Nineteenth Century was not going</page><page sequence="20">46 by ARTHUR MIZENER to be so sure as this that in the end it was improving matters, as Henry Sidgwick made so touchingly clear when he wrote: Well, the years pass, the struggle with what Carlyle used to call "Hebrew old clothes" is over, Freedom is won, and what does Freedom bring us to? It brings us face to face with atheistic science: the faith in God and Immortality, which we have been struggling to clear from superstition suddenly seems to be in the air. . . . But Doctor Johnson could hardly foresee how far this clearing away of appendages was to go, and Pope is a triumphant demonstration of how right he was for his own day. For Pope so tactfully asks us to believe Belinda is the sun that we scarcely know we have been asked; to have asked us directly to believe that Anne, who "dost sometimes counsel take?and sometimes tea," had divine powers like the sun's had little difficulty and as little use; and Doctor Johnson was happy to observe that Pope "was never reduced to the necessity of soliciting the sun to shine upon a birthday, of calling the Graces and Virtues to a wed ding. . . ." When he was not writing his mock heroic about Be linda and sylphs and gnomes "he was at liberty to be silent." There is an obvious qualification here which ought perhaps to be mentioned. The Eighteenth Century could make a kind of direct use of the life of nature. I suppose this use must owe something to Milton; certainly it owes a great deal to the Dryden of the Anne Killigrew ode. This use was possible because it was such that the reader never needed to take serious and direct notice of it (one of the things which annoyed the Eighteenth Century most about the metaphysical poets was just this impolite kind of insistence that they be supposed to mean exactly what they said?"for I,/Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,/Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me"). In the Eighteenth Century the comparison of man and nature, when made openly, presented itself to the reader at best as diction, as the elegant ob servance of an established and recognized etiquette (OED 1750) which did the poet's manners credit rather than committed him and the reader quite seriously to its implications. At its most</page><page sequence="21">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_47 dangerous, the comparison presented itself as sentiment. At its best, therefore, it was limited to the more formal kinds, to odes, elegies and imitations. Pope's "Elegy to the Memory of an Un fortunate Lady" is a good example: What though no sacred earth allow thq room, Nor hallowM dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb? Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast: There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow, There the first roses of the year shall blow: While angels with their silver wings o'ershade The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made. The turf which lies lightly and the morn which weeps deliberately insist on their conventionality here, and we are comfortable with them because the convention they represent is so well authenti cated: they come of a very good family; there is a great deal of this feeling in the age's attitude toward the classics. In the same way, the echo of the metaphysical conceit presents itself to us as little more than a charming verbal solution of the unfortunate lady's unchristian burial. Behind our backs, as it were, after we have admitted them to our society as a result of their having demonstrated in this way their politeness, these figures are of course doing something more serious and not so simply con ventional, just as Pope's mock heroic is; but their ostensible claim is to nothing more than elegance and politeness, just as the osten sible claim of Pope's mock heroic is to nothing more than neatness and sense. All this comes out in Fielding, a much simpler man than Pope, very clearly. Fielding got much of his humor out of the mock heroic by the simple device of asking us to notice the snobbery ("A battle sung by the Muse in the Homerican style, and which none but the classical reader can taste") or the practical ineffect iveness of this polite use of the old comparison: Twelve times did the iron register of time beat on the sonor ous bell metal, summoning the ghosts to rise and walk their nightly round.?In plainer language, it was twelve o'clock, and all the family, as we have said, lay buried in drink and sleep. . . .</page><page sequence="22">48 by ARTHUR MIZENER Yet for all this downright man's scorn of its mere politeness, the old analogy between the life of man and the life of nature was what Fielding turned to when he came to describe Sophia, who was so lovingly patterned after his own Charlotte. The "short hint of what we can do in the sublime" with which this chapter begins is not at all the same kind of thing as the Butler-inspired account of Molly Seagrim's heroic defense of her new dress. The greatness of Pope's poetry, then, depends on his indirect importation into it of the larger context of man's life, an importa tion most evident in the mock heroic. In that kind Pope achieves his versions of almost all the powerful effects of his predecessors. The close of The Dunciad is the most obvious case of the use of nature on a large scale; the sylphs and gnomes of The Rape of the Lock are an instance of the sustained use of the supernatural; and the details of saints and angels are everywhere: Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day, Charm'd the small-pox, or chas'd old-age away; . . . To patch, nay ogle, might become a saint, Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint. It is this survival of a feeling for the older view of things which leads Pope to pursue the incongruous mock heroic or satiric use of it with such insistent if inobtrusive care and gives him that habit of expression which every reader notices. The sustained imperial comparison in Of the Character of Women is a good example : Yet mark the fate of a whole Sex of Queens! Power ali their end, but Beauty all their means: In Youth they conquer, with so wild a rage, As leaves them scarce a subject in their Age: For foieign glory, foreign joy, they roam; No thought of peace or happiness at home. But Wisdom's triumph is well-timed Retreat, As hard a science to the Fair as Great! Beauties, like Tyrants, old and friendless grown, Yet hate repose, and dread to be alone, Worn out in public, weary every eye, Nor leave one sigh behind them when they die. What is evident here is the irony of the comparison: the "divine" power of these queens is their physical beauty, as it was, for the</page><page sequence="23">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_49 Greeks, Cressida's and as it was, for Mercutio, Rosalind's; Pope appears not to be deploring this fact at all?so far has the old view affirmed by Romeo and Juliet sunk into the background; his moral, as usual, is: What then remains but well our pow'r to use And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose? In exactly the same way the ostensible political moral is an appeal for the benevolent tyrant, for Ulysses' ideal ruler rather than Troilus'. Yet there is a pressing of this comparison between queens and women which will not quite be explained as the merely clever exploitation of a reasonable illustrative resemblance. Pope felt a mystery in the power of womjen which he could adequately convey only by comparing women to queens. This is a feeling analgous to the one which drives Milton to make Eve, before her fall, into something very like a beautiful pagan god dess: To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorn'd, Likest she seem'd, Pomona, when she fled Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. What makes this comparison the only means for conveying Pope's feeling is the ultimate, if obscured, reality for him of the divinity of queens. Pope was as keenly aware that queens could be mortal and Tyrants as he was that women in general could be mortal and Beauties: this is the evident ground of his figure. But he knew in his way also that kings and queens were partly divine and that their inevitable mortality made for that tragic dilemma which Richard II had to face. It was terrible as well as ludicrous, as Pope saw life demonstrating on all hands to him, with that persistence of vision which made him so fine a poet, that these divine creatures were after all so often only humanly "divine," only, that is, very charming and mortal: For you have but mistook me all this while: I live with bread like you, feel want, taste grief, Need friends: subjected thus How can you say to me I am a king! This is the less evident but no less powerful ground of Pope's</page><page sequence="24">50 by ARTHUR MIZENER figure. His Beauties are fallen angels as his Tyrants are glister ing Phaethons wanting the manage of unruly jades. There is even in Pope's attitude here, I think, something of that subtle complex of feelings about the necessity and tragedy of knowledge and experience which made Milton compare Eve in her lovely innocence to goddesses of fruitfulness while they were "Yet Virgin." Like Milton, Pope too could see that though in a fallen world we "cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue" (so that there is a kind of pathetic Tightness beneath the ostensible wrongness in Eve's desire to face temptation alone in the garden), there still remains in women, as some of the angelic glory re mained in Satan, enough of the original divine innocence to make men worship them. For all his Reason Pope was no more a nat uralist than he was a republican. Pope is perhaps the last great poet who is in this tradition, with its dependence on the old explanation of the natural and supernatural contexts of man's life to justify serious comparisons among the three. Wordsworth is clearly the beginning of that eccentricity of "philosophy" which has been disturbing unprofes sional readers ever since. Wordsworth managed to save, for him self anyway, a bearable world by virtue of this eccentricity, as few other poets since his time have. After Wordsworth the Nineteenth Century poets tended more and more to use the Pathetic Fallacy or to fall back on a kind of emotional mysticism ("And like a man in wrath the heart/Stood up and answer'd CI have felt.'"). And whatever Ruskin may have said by way of excusing the Pathetic Fallacy, he never said that to project human feelings onto external nature was true. The richest tradition of English poetry is clearly near an end when the poets, finding themselves deprived of all "appendages of spectres and predic tions," are forced to make strictly human love the one resort left to man confronted by a wholly alien nature: Ah, love, let us be true To one another! For the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain. . . .</page><page sequence="25">NATURE OF ENGLISH POETRY_51 This is to find Donne's lady the only "angel" and Herrick's ruby alone starlike. The only resort for such an attitude is romantic irony. For the end of believing nature exclusively natural is to believe man so too.</page></plain_text>
