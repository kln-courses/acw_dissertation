<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESEARCH REPORTS BALSDON FELLOWSHIP Power and place in Etruria. The spatial dynamics of a mediterranean civilization, 1200-500 bc My major work was centred on writing a book on the spatial organization of the Etruscans, concentrating on the neglected importance of settlement organization: Power and Place in Etruria. The Spatial Dynamics of a Mediterranean Civilization, 1200-500 bc. The last two decades have been particularly fruitful in producing a range of landscape studies of a high standard, which can now be combined with longer-standing evidence for the development of political centres. The result of this research shows distinct trajectories of political development and variable concentration of power in urban centres and in the interstices between these political centres. To this end, research was undertaken both in the libraries of Rome and on fieldtrips into Lazio, Umbria and Tuscany. The results of this work are scheduled to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2006. Other supplementary projects also took place. The principal projects were as follows. (1) The groundwork was undertaken with the Camerone team (principally Stephen Kay) to implement NERC-supported LiDAR survey of sites in the Tiber Valley area. Initially this was centred on Veii, but is now scheduled to take place over the Faliscan territory in May 2005. (2) Contact was re-established with the civic administration of Gubbio and the Superintendency in Perugia. A programme of further detailed study of the material recovered in joint excavations with Caroline Malone has now been instituted. (3) Presentations were given in Milan (Scuola di Specializzazione), Rome and Louvain-la- Neuve (Belgium) on Etruscan and Maltese themes. My formal Balsdon lecture involved both British (Caroline Malone) and Maltese colleagues (Suzannah Depasquale and Nicholas Velia) in a well-attended seminar on Maltese archaeology and heritage. The seminar covered the foundation and development of Heritage Malta, the relationship of the British School at Rome and Malta, Maltese prehistoric art and Maltese prehistoric mortuary customs. (4) A successful Marie Curie proposal was submitted to the European Commission by Gabriele Cifani and myself to enable him to spend two post-doctoral years in Cambridge from September 2005 in conjunction with farther fieldwork in the Tiber Valley area. (5) I assisted Simon McBride and Simon Morley (two contemporary artists) in the creation of a video installation, entitled Dis Manibus, which has been shown in Rome and Milan. Simon Stoddart (Department of Archaeology and Magdalene College, University of Cambridge) CARY FELLOWSHIP Byzantine building patronage in post-reconquest Rome The Fellowship primarily involved teaching the School's postgraduate 'City of Rome' course (April-May, with Ed Bispham) and undergraduate 'Ancient Rome' Summer School (September, with Alex Thein). Invariably, we have found that the students' enthusiasm and inquisitiveness encourage the tutors to see the city with new eyes each year. 273</page><page sequence="2">274 RESEARCH REPORTS My current research concerns Byzantine building patronage in Rome. This remains an under-studied topic, with past work tending to concentrate on political and administrative history or on the stylistic analysis of architecture, painting and mosaic. I propose to identify major building projects in Rome in the period c. 550-750 that can be attributed to Byzantine officials. Work in the civil sphere on the city's fortifications, aqueducts, public spaces (palace and forum) and management of the classical patrimony (upkeep or spoliation of temples and entertainment buildings) is comparatively well known thanks to epigraphic and textual sources, although archaeological evidence has never been sought. More uncertain is Byzantine patronage of ecclesiastical buildings. Here, our main problem is a lack of textual evidence to balance the canonical status of the purely Roman Liber Pontiftcalis, which very seldom records non-papal building. Here, my argument is partly one from silence. In other words, I have concentrated upon all those churches whose foundation is not recorded in the Liber Pontiftcalis, but which we know from other sources were built in the period under study. Of the exclusions from the official papal record, there exists a sizeable nucleus of buildings that may be attributed to Byzantine patronage. Many are dedicated to saints firmly associated with the eastern ruling caste, notably the military saints Theodore, Sergius and Bacchus, George, Eustace, Mennas, and the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (one military dedication, to Saint Hadrian, does appear in the Liber; but this, too, must have been an imperial donation since it involved the conversion of the Curia). In addition, there is a group of dedications to the Theotokos, whose post-reconquest foundation is excluded entirely from the Liber Pontiftcalis: Santa Maria Antiqua, Santa Maria in Domnica, Santa Maria in Aquiro, Santa Maria in Via Lata and Santa Maria in Cosmedin (the dedication of the Pantheon, recorded in the Liber Pontificalis as an imperial donation, would also be a part of this group, as perhaps would the late sixth-century rededication of the titulus luli as Santa Maria in Trastevere). These form part of a wave of dedications to the Theotokos in the newly-conquered Byzantine territories that may be seen as an expression both of anti- Arian triumphalism (Vandals, Ostrogoths and Lombards, denying Christ's consubstantiality with God, finding it impossible to accept Mary as mother of God) and gratitude to the divine sponsor of the imperial army and the Byzantine state as a whole. Initial presentations of this thesis were made at two conferences in 2004: Le città italiane tra la tarda antichità e V alto medioevo, held at Ravenna in February, and Cités de V Italie tardo-antique at the École Francaise de Rome in March (to be published in Collection de l'École Franqaise de Rome, edited by M. Ghilardi, C. Goddard and P. Porena). I am currently enlarging the project to include foundations by private individuals connected to the Byzantine state, and to set such patronage more firmly within the administrative context of Byzantine Rome (and this will take in archaeological evidence, from the Crypta Balbi, of the coinage from the Mint of Rome and the lead seals of various government officials). In addition, the Byzantine role in the institution of the diaconiae needs re- examining. The subject of icon and relic transmission (notably of saints with imperial connections, such as Anastasius, Ignatius, and Philip and James) might also be included in the overall picture of Roman-Byzantine relations. It was a great pleasure to collaborate with Valerie Scott and the staff of the School library and archive in selecting, identifying and displaying photographs of late nineteenth- century Rome by Peter Paul Mackey, for an exhibition held at the School in January 2005. These represent merely a small proportion of the treasures of the School's archive, and the extremely popular exhibition will, we hope, be followed by further opportunities to display similarly important and unpublished documents to the wider public. Robert Coates-Stephens (The British School at Rome)</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH REPORTS 275 PAUL MELLON CENTRE ROME FELLOWSHIP Academic politics: art historians in Rome in the 1920s and 1930s In an article of 1928 published in Capitolium, Eugenie Strong, Assistant Director of the British School at Rome from 1909 to 1925, described the work of eighteen foreign institutes located in the city of Rome: a strikingly high number. The Grand Tour lived on in the era of train and car. Prominent among academic visitors converging on Rome in the early twentieth century were art historians, members of a still young discipline, who travelled to Italy to study the canon. Upon crossing the Alps in 1910, Emil Schaeffer noted in a card to Aby Warburg: 'I am breathing in great gulps Italian air, which is the healthiest for my art historical lungs'. Artifacts of Italy were accorded greater than local significance. In the interwar years (1919-39), which, it can be argued, saw the coming of age of Art History across Europe and in the United States, Italian art provided the sample on which many significant disciplinary thinkers would base their work. Long-enduring models for the analysis of style, form and meaning were developed, as narratives about mediterranean art and its heritage were composed. Rome offered libraries, archives and an unparalleled sweep of monuments - ancient, medieval, early modern and baroque. The city was a rendezvous-point for art historians of different nations, schools and generations, a place where contacts were made, even as individual academic identities were sharpened and defined. During my four-month period of residence at the School, I laid the foundations for a cultural history of disciplinary thought in the interwar years set in Rome. Archival research I undertook shed much light on academic-political currents: in the bitter aftermath of the First World War, against the backdrop of the rise of Fascism and the massive displacement of Jewish scholars, art historians (like others in the humanities) reacted to contemporary developments as they offered interpretations of the monuments of the common past. Over the course of my stay I was able to work in a good many libraries and institutional archives and to visit and revisit monuments that have commanded significant art historical attention. But I spent the greater part of my time working with materials available at the School, where a voluminous two-sided correspondence is preserved. British School at Rome Directors were obliged to prepare regular reports for managing committees in London and to offer full justification for expenditures. When one has sieved out the mass of domestic detail, what remains is a vivid chronicle of intellectual and political life in Rome over the course of decades - from the era of Thomas Ashby and Eugenie Strong that ended in 1925, through the brief reigns of subsequent Directors: Bernard Ashmole, Arthur Hamilton Smith, Ian Richmond, Colin Hardie and Ralegh Radford. Eugenie Strong's letters stand out for offering perspectives on international exchange, which she herself did much to promote, and for providing Italophile accounts of local attitudes: for example, a letter of 1916 where she describes 'the Italian determination that when the war is over neither Germany nor any other country shall ever be allowed to dictate in matters of Learning or of Science'. Reports from younger Directors yield insight into contemporary conditions. Ian Richmond, for example, recorded praise for his research on the Mausoleum of Augustus received from Mussolini, while Colin Hardie, who briefly closed the School during the Abyssinian crisis, shows himself impatient with the status quo, which he described lengthily even as he criticized it. My project might be described as an effort to situate the ivory tower in the interwar political landscape. My larger goals are to provide a matrix for reading still influential disciplinary works, to bring unjustly neglected writings to the fore (including some by</page><page sequence="4">276 RESEARCH REPORTS Eugenie Strong), and ultimately to contribute to an issue-based history of 'thought around images'. Elizabeth Sears (Department of History of Art, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) ROME FELLOWSHIP The role of relics in art patronage, collecting and aristocratic devotion in early modern Rome (1563-c. 1650) The project I began during my time in Rome focused on the role of sacred objects (relics, reliquaries and other devotional items) in the cultural and devotional practice of aristocratic patrons, in Rome and further afield, following the Council of Trent's decree on the veneration of relics in 1563. My aim was, and is, to explore the different meanings that are attached to relics in post-Tridentine culture, and to determine how acts of veneration, art patronage and collecting, undertaken during an era that witnessed a revitalized commitment to the cult of relics, may be seen to have not only devotional and aesthetic resonance, but also social, political, dynastic and gendered dimensions. While in Rome, I concentrated principally on the issue of relic collecting, and the under-researched theme of sacred collections made by aristocratic patrons, ostensibly for private devotional purposes. In early modern Rome, relics were frequently maintained within palace chapels and oratories, and noble relic collectors included members of the Barberini and Borghese families. Although these religious treasuries allude to fabulous relic hoards preserved in churches, they were hidden from public view. Only traces of them have survived. However, relics and reliquaries preserved in palaces were often minutely inventoried amongst the most precious, and the more prosaic, possessions of the nobility. Documentary evidence therefore can offer us a tantalizing impression of sacred collections of ornate and exquisite vessels containing poignant and sometimes bizarre holy memorabilia. Using documents held in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana and the Archivio Segreto Vaticano, I attempted to determine the form and evolution of a number of devotional collections of the seventeenth century. I concentrated particularly on the oratory established at the Palazzo Borghese in the Campo Marzio, a space made sumptuous by its many adornments and reliquaries; and the collections of the Barberini cardinals, retained at the Palazzo Barberini alle Quattro Fontane, which featured a range of tactile and evocative sacred objects. What is particularly special about a nine-month Fellowship at the British School at Rome is the opportunity it allows for addressing the wider issues and questions emanating from one's research. I was able to use part of my time in Rome to undertake an overview of art and architectural projects of the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries linked to the retrieval and presentation of relics, including major acts of patronage by the Borghese and Barberini. In so doing, my objective was to establish relationships between, on the one hand, key ecclesiastical projects (notably the Cappella Paolina at Santa Maria Maggiore and the Cappella di San Sebastiano at San Sebastiano fuori le mura) and, on the other, acts of collecting and display undertaken by the same noble patrons for palace chapels. I hope that these investigations will shed fresh light on the concealed realm of private devotional practice in the period, and, in terms of the larger project, raise new questions on the</page><page sequence="5">RESEARCH REPORTS 277 significance of relics retained both within and beyond the sphere of the aristocratic household. Alice Sanger (Independent Art Historian) ROME SCHOLARSHIPS Gabriele Rangone (ob. 1486): the first observant Franciscan cardinal and some aspects of his patronage in Rome and Bagnoregio In 1451 the Observant Franciscan friar Gabriele (Rangone) da Verona went on a missionary campaign to Austria, Bohemia and Moravia, to promote the Franciscan Observance, to preach against the heresies and to support the crusades against the Turks. Consequently, for the following ten years, friar Gabriele lived mostly outside Italy, devoting his energy and religious fervour to a constant battle against the heretics in central Europe. It was in those years that he also moved up the ecclesiastical hierarchy. In 1472 friar Gabriele was granted his first bishopric, in Transylvania; and in 1475 King Matthias Corvinus wanted him to be moved to a richer and more prominent bishopric in Hungary. Friar Gabriele established a close relationship with King Matthias, becoming one of his most trusted advisers. Having moved from humble friar to bishop and adviser to a king, Gabriele Rangone reached the status of prince of the Church in 1477, when Sixtus IV created him cardinal priest of the titulus of Santi Sergio e Bacco in the Roman Forum. Born of modest parents in Chiari, a village near Brescia, Rangone belonged to that group of cardinals who were not of grand origins but who had been sponsored by important figures. His political relationship with the king of Hungary and the Republic of Venice significantly influenced his subsequent political network in the Roman Curia. As a cardinal, Rangone was not required to follow the Rule of absolute poverty set up by the Franciscan Order, unless it were his personal choice, but, when compared to some of his contemporary princes of the church, he did have a rather austere life-style, which also shaped his patronage as a Renaissance cardinal. Among the duties of a cardinal was that of restoring the titular church. Rangone's titular church of Santi Sergio e Bacco, once in the Roman Forum, was unfortunately demolished in the sixteenth century, so little physical evidence survives with which to assess his activities there. In contrast, his funerary chapel, dedicated to Saint Bonaventura in the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, still exists. Rangone was certainly among the cardinals who took part in the ceremony of canonization of Bonaventura, celebrated in Rome on 13 April 1482, and his chapel is the first to have been dedicated to the new saint in Rome. In choosing this dedication, Rangone was expressing clearly his personal devotion to the new Franciscan saint. Rangone's devotion to Bonaventura is also proved by a second chapel dedicated to the same saint that the cardinal wanted to build in Bagnoregio, the saint's home town, of which unfortunately little is known. Bonaventura had been the first member of the Franciscan brotherhood to be named cardinal, in 1273, and Cardinal Rangone possibly was suggesting a sort of continuity and analogy between himself and Bonaventura. The most distinctive features of Rangone's chapel at the Aracoeli are its apsidal termination and the cosmati floor: these two stylistic choices plausibly were inspired by contemporary models fashionable in the circle of Pope Sixtus IV, such as the plan of the chapel of the Immaculata in Saint Peter's and the cosmati floor of the Sistine chapel. Yet, the absence of any painted decoration in the Rangone chapel, and the fact that there is no evidence of a monumental tomb, is significant, and seems to indicate that the cardinal wanted to be buried</page><page sequence="6">278 RESEARCH REPORTS in a rather humble way, as befitted his Franciscan status. Therefore, the construction, decoration and dedication to Saint Bonaventura of the chapel in Rome speak more of a strong personal devotion than a declaration of personal wealth and power. Roberto Cobianchi (Bibliotheca Hertziana, Rome) The censorship of foreign books under Fascism The research I undertook in Rome builds on my doctoral work, which examined the dissemination of American culture in Italy during the Fascist period. A striking, and paradoxical, feature of the Italian literary landscape at that time was the presence of large numbers of foreign authors. In the context of a stridently nationalist regime, the very fact that so many translations circulated is clearly significant, and prompts a series of questions concerning official policy towards cultural imports. The purpose of the present project is to investigate the way in which foreign books, and more specifically novels, were monitored and censored by the authorities. When I attempted to delineate some of the restrictions that were placed on the circulation of translated fiction under Fascism, I was aware that the censorship of literature, whether it be Italian or foreign, was a vast, relatively under-researched area, especially if one compares it to film and to theatre. It soon became apparent why this should be the case: the relevant material is still largely disorganized and widely dispersed, mainly because the censoring process was centralized only in 1937, with the setting up of the Ministero della Cultura Popolare. There was therefore no systematic censorship of books before the late 1930s, although works by known anti-Fascists were proscribed. As a direct result of the anti-semitic legislation brought into force at the end of 1938, a blacklist was drawn up - the so-called bonifica libraria - that led to books by hundreds of Jewish writers being banned. It is important, however, to bear in mind that the last years of the dictatorship were not representative of state censorship throughout the Fascist ventennio, and that the exigencies of the publishing industry often prevailed over ideological constraints. For that reason, in my project I have paid attention as much to what was deemed 'acceptable' for the Italian public to read as to what was regarded as inappropriate, politically or morally 'dangerous'. By its very nature, censorship is a covert activity, and this was especially true of literary censorship in the Fascist period, when the regime was keen to represent itself, at home and abroad, as open and forward-looking, an enlightened patron of the arts that supported intellectuals, writers, painters and composers - provided they did not criticize or challenge the status quo. Thus, Mussolini's dictatorship was able to maintain consensus by allowing its citizens access to films, newspapers and books whilst, at the same time, excluding any views that might undermine official doctrine or that were perceived to be subversive. In Rome I was able to consult the files of the Ministero dell'Interno and the Ministero della Cultura Popolare at the Archivio Centrale dello Stato that documented the regulation of books and periodical publications, including the interception of parcels containing these two items. A valuable source of information on translations was provided by journals and magazines published in Italy during the interwar years that were located in various libraries, including the Biblioteca Nazionale, the Biblioteca Alessandrina and the Biblioteca 'Angelo Monteverdi' at the University of Rome 'La Sapienza'. Drawing on a variety of sources, I have compiled an extensive bibliography of translations of foreign literature, with the names of translators wherever possible. It is based on the output of a large number of publishing houses, including many small firms that no longer exist, in order to avoid an excessive bias towards Mondadori and, to a lesser extent, Bompiani. In addition, I have</page><page sequence="7">RESEARCH REPORTS 279 examined many first editions of translated novels from the period, in preparation for the next stage of my research, which will consist of a detailed textual analysis. Whilst investigating a largely hidden aspect of Italy's cultural history, I found that an unexpected benefit of my residency at the British School was the material evidence of the Fascist past - I was struck by just how present that era still feels in Rome. Barely a few steps away from the School are examples of rationalist architecture. And beyond, from the restructured Piazza Augusta Imperatore to the Foro Italico, from the Città Universitaria to the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia on the Via Tuscolana, under the guise of modernity, the regime sought to assert its all-pervasiveness. Jane Dunnett (Italian Department, University of Wales, Swansea) Monastic forgery: a comparative analysis of the roles and reception of spurious texts in central and southern Italy, c. 1050-1200 Forgeries, by their very nature, may seem to be a somewhat misleading form of historical evidence. Surely, as texts that appear to be something they are not, these documents only serve to hamper the research efforts of historians? If this should be the case, then the task of the medievalist may be deemed to require more effort than most. The Middle Ages, particularly the eleventh and twelfth centuries, were awash with forgeries. Most of them were produced by Benedictine monks - a group whose job description and power base rested on the performance of prayers for the sins of others. Traditionally, these monastic forgeries have remained largely the domain of palaeographers and experts in medieval diplomatic. The task of these specialists centred on the identification of specious texts that were assessed in terms of their aberrations from standard formulary. Of primary concern was the separation of the authentic from the spurious and - implicitly - the fact from the fiction. In the process, historians largely neglected the significant possibilities that forgeries offer as legitimate sources in their own right. But recently, this constricted view of textual forgeries has been reassessed and many researchers have attempted to engage with these texts in a variety of ways that highlight their potential as historical sources. These contemporary studies, however, have concentrated largely on the mentalities surrounding the production of forged texts, particularly notions of intent and monastic memory. Scant attention has been paid to the documentary culture or administrative infrastructure in which these texts were received: such an oversight is a critical one, as an appraisal of reception has the potential to reveal how these documents ultimately functioned in their contemporary context. Similarly, little work has been done using a comparative approach. This is a surprising gap. Given that monastic forgery was a widespread and relatively common act in the central Middle Ages, a comparative method that goes beyond the isolated case-study provides an appropriate and informative methodological framework for these sources. In response to the issues outlined above, my current doctoral research places substantial emphasis on the eleventh- and twelfth-century reception and use of monastic forgeries. While questions concerning the production of these texts are not ignored, the primary concern is to distinguish and differentiate between production and reception, and to examine the relationship between these two processes. The scope of the project incorporates several monasteries located in central and southern Italy, although three in particular constitute the core group for the analysis: Santa Sofia at Benevento, San Vincenzo al Volturno and San Lorenzo at Aversa.</page><page sequence="8">280 RESEARCH REPORTS The Rome Scholarship has formed an integral part of the research for my dissertation: the nine months at the British School allowed me to access the primary sources that form the nexus of my thesis. In the manuscript room of the Vatican Library I was able to study two twelfth-century monastic cartularies, as well as countless editions and rare secondary sources. My project also took me beyond the walls of Rome itself, as I had the opportunity to conduct research at archives, both public and private, in Benevento, Naples and Frascati. The application of a reception-oriented methodology has drawn attention to the varied and adaptable part that forged charters played within monastic communities; it has also made apparent the differences between monasteries regarding the manner in which these texts were employed. Even more revealing, particularly for an exposition of the general documentary practices of the period, is the way monasteries used forged texts to manage their relations with external groups. Accordingly, I plan to explore more fully in future articles the relationship between monastic forgeries and the formation of political alliances, as well as the subtle role of spurious texts in dispute resolution. Furthermore, an assessment of the complex interdependency between forged texts and genuine texts (both narrative and non-narrative) suggests that spurious charters were more often falsifications of form rather than of content - a finding that requires the historian to jettison the ostensible pairing of authenticity with fact and of forgery with fiction. Julie-Ann Vickers (Clare Hall, University of Cambridge) RALEGH RADFORD ROME SCHOLARSHIP Changing patterns in the exploitation of the Caira Massif during the later modern period For Braudel, the principal agents determining man's relationship with the mountains of the Mediterranean were the environment and the prevailing social, economic and political structures. Man and the environment were locked in a history of ever-recurring seasonal cycles where change was slow and almost imperceptible (the longue durée), whilst the social, economic and political structures were subject to more perceptible rhythms over generations or centuries (the conjunctures). Together they formed a framework that severely limited the events and individual lives of the short-term (the événements), both of which were relatively insignificant to Braudel. My doctoral research moves away from the broad sweep of Braudel' s Mediterranean- wide history to carry out a more detailed study of a mountain landscape in south-central Italy known as the Caira Massif, to the northwest of Cassino. A traditional way of life characterized by subsistence mixed-farming survived there until the early 1970s. The landscape is replete with its material remains, whilst local town hall, church and regional archives hold what remains of the documentary record of the area. The Massif is also home to many older men and women who can provide testimony of how they, their contempor- aries and their ancestors once lived. My thesis concerns the changing patterns in exploitation of the Caira Massif from 1700 to 1970, a period that encompasses major changes, including the abolishment of feudalism, land reform, revolutionary improvements in communications, and the mass emigration and 'economic miracle' of the post-war period. By combining the three sources of evidence outlined above, I am able to investigate all three 'layers' of Braudel's historical time: the longue durée and the conjunctures, through the archaeology and documentary evidence, and the événements, primarily through the ethnographic data.</page><page sequence="9">RESEARCH REPORTS 28 1 Having surveyed the archaeology of an extensive area of the upland landscape and collected oral history prior to beginning my Scholarship, my priorities when in Rome were to research the national, regional and local history of the period under study and to trawl through the varied archives. To these ends I made particular use of the Biblioteca di Storia Moderna e Contemporanea, the libraries of the British School at Rome and the Società Geografica Italiana, the State Archives of Naples, Caserta and Frosinone, the Archivio Centrale dello Stato, and the Archivio Segreto Vaticano. The search for historic maps, indispensable to any landscape study, also took me to a number of libraries in Naples and Cassino and to the Istituto Geografico Militare in Florence. Amongst the most interesting documents I found were the Catasto Onciario from 1741 and the Catasto Murattiano of 1815, two cadastres containing invaluable data on the nature and extent of contemporary land use and land tenure. The government inquests into the society and economy of 181 1, 1881 and 1915 provide information on the state of agriculture in my study area spanning a century. They are of particular importance given that data of this kind were largely absent from the archives, whose contents mainly dealt with animal husbandry, woodland legislation and management, and disputes over pasture, use rights and boundaries. My research to date has made it possible to discern the rhythms of the longer-term cycles in the relationship between man and the Caira Massif, and to trace the local impact of many socio-economic and political changes. However, it also suggests that the role of the environment in determining how the Caira Massif was exploited was not as prominent as Braudel would contend. From the detailed insights into household subsistence strategies provided by oral history, it would seem that, alongside the prevailing socio-economic and political conditions, it was access to land, labour and capital in the short-term that was fundamental to how the landscape was exploited. I anticipate that my completed thesis will highlight the role of the individual in the recent history of the Caira Massif and thereby contribute to the debate on Braudel's writings and human agency. Michele Forte (Department of Archaeology and Prehistory, University of Sheffield) ROME AWARDS Embodiments of Empire My Ph.D. thesis is a study of how the geography and ethnography of the Roman Empire were represented in anthropomorphic form ('personified') in Roman art. My four-month Rome Award began with a study of the city's simulacra gentium groups. I looked again at the literary evidence for lost monuments, such as the nationes from Pompey's theatre complex and the Augustan porticus ad nationes, and examined the surviving second-century reliefs found in the Piazza di Pietra - the gentes connected with the so-called Hadrianeum. My major concern was how such groups reinforced the centrality of Rome within her empire by contributing to the discourse that constructed the city as a microcosm. For the collections of sculpture were able to mirror the diversity of the empire and of the City's inhabitants, and at the same time, in constructing the images according to traditional allegorical models, to transcend the limits of mimetic representation. The connotative power of the figures' written labels and/or visual 'attributes' gave Rome the potential to be larger and more inclusive than its physical boundaries actually permitted. As such, each of the simulacra gentium monuments served as a permanent, visual manifestation of how 'the vast world was within</page><page sequence="10">282 RESEARCH REPORTS the city' (ingens orbis in urbe fuit: Ovid, Ars Amatoria 1.174). I also looked at how these clusters of peripheral gentes had the power to create discordance within the urban environment, through off bring rival 'centres' within the city (which were often connected with an individual and their political achievement). During my stay at the British School I gave a public lecture in which I offered a reappraisal of the Hadrianeum figures, whose identities have been hotly debated since their rediscovery. I moved away from the kind of approach that treats the figures as incontestable documents containing 'truths' about the ethnography of the empire (or even about its conventional representation in Roman art). I focused, rather, on the holistic appearance of the group of extant figures, and showed how its carefully balanced aesthetic of deviation - in terms of drapery arrangements, hairstyles, and foot- and head-gear - fabricated false differences between the gentes or nationes they claimed to represent. I compared representations of groups of organic entities such as Muses and Seasons, where it was clearer to see how it was membership of the group that determined both the physical iconography of the individual figures and the boundaries and character of the concept it represented. In undermining, to an extent, the meaning behind each individual costume or 'indigenous' weapon, I tried to direct attention away from a fictional omniscient viewer who was able to identify each figure unproblematically, towards an awareness of the iconographical tactics used by the patrons and designers of these images to create their own fiction - that of omniscient knowledge of the (their) empire. This approach - which can be applied to every one of the representations I saw and photographed in Rome - sees the representation of the attributes and attitudes of such 'symbolic' figures as a flamboyant means to display often non-existent knowledge about peoples and places of the empire; to disseminate the impression of a confident, total imperial control, a control from which the uncomprehending viewer was isolated. Since returning from Rome I have been writing about the simulacra of cities carried in the Imperial triumph, and the particular brand of power exercised in creating representations of conquered lands, especially in the form of the human body; and about how the character of all these anthropomorphized 'abstractions', tangible only through their representation, is fundamentally changed in the broader context of developments in artistic style - here I have been looking back to stylistic changes in Greek art, as well as the art of other cultures, in particular of the ancient Near East. It is the time I spent whilst holding the Rome Award walking round the museum collections of Rome that has given me the repertoire of images and ideas from which to reconstruct this bigger picture. Jessica Hughes (Courtauld Institute of Art, London) Architecture, archaeology and urbanism in 'La grande Roma9: the Via dell'Impero and the Palazzo del Littorio competition It is well known that Fascist ideology assigned the myth of ancient Rome a central place in its aesthetic and ideological framework. The ancient and glorious past was invoked to bolster the Fascist's claims to political legitimacy and inevitability. In the field of architecture, the 'emulative juxtaposition' of Roman ruins with modern buildings became one of the most determined tropes of Fascist planning. Perhaps the most audacious, and also the most impressive, instance of this tactic is the series of works undertaken to reframe and remake the central archaeological area of Rome by choreographing the ruins of the imperial fora and also by building a colossal monument to Fascism, the Palazzo del Littorio. The competition brief for the Palazzo proposed a 'foro fascista' equivalent to the ancient fora,</page><page sequence="11">RESEARCH REPORTS 283 running across the Basilica of Maxentius and on the newly-constructed via dell'Impero (today's via dei Fori Imperiali). This avenue was a new triumphal way linking the southern parts of the city with those to the north and east, running parallel to the ancient Via Sacra. The vast bulk of the Palazzo, at the heart of ancient and modern imperial space, would suggest the capacity of the Fascist state to both restore and supersede antiquity. The Palazzo was to contain the offices of the National Fascist Party, a Sacrario honouring the fallen heroes of the Fascist ^evolution, and offices for Mussolini. It was also to be the permanent home of the Mostra della Rivoluzione Fascista. Just as this exhibition was designed to celebrate Fascism, the Palazzo was to be a figuration of Fascism and of the Mussolinian epoch. The competition attracted entries from many of the most prominent Italian architects and engineers of the period, their styles ranging from a monumental classicism to an equally immense modernism. The Palazzo del Littorio competition (1933/ 1937) may be seen as a catalyst and benchmark of architectural practice, as it provided a locus of encounter between modernism and the academic tradition. It is particularly important in this regard since the relationship between modernism and the academic tradition was not yet defined clearly. Indeed, the fact that a politically 'reactionary' regime should actively foster an aesthetic pluralism in its state architecture complicates the essentialist fiction that labels modernism 'good' (ideologically and aesthetically) and classicism 'bad'. While in Rome my work focused on two primary areas: (1) identifying and analyzing sources of information concerning the Palazzo del Littorio competition and archaeological work undertaken by the Fascists in the central archaeological area; (2) writing a brief historiography of the interconnections between archaeology and architecture in Fascist Rome. To this end, I spent much time at the Archivio Centrale dello Stato at EUR. Importantly for my project, it preserves the 'archivi fascisti', which include primary sources relating to the Palazzo del Littorio competition and the Mostra della Rivoluzione Fascista. Another invaluable source of information has been the photograph collections in the Museo di Roma, which include hundreds of photographs (organized into albums) taken in the late twenties and thirties to record the demolitions of the Fascist sventramenti, as well as photographs of models and drawings of proposals for the development of the via dell'Impero. I have also consulted the libraries of different research institutes and the major Roman libraries for primary and secondary literature not easily obtainable outside Italy. Among these, the British School at Rome's own excellent collection of books relating to Roman topography was an invaluable resource. Another principal aim was to study and photograph the Fascist systematization of central Rome as it exists today. I gave a short paper on this work to the Associazione Italiana di Archeologia Classica in December and another at the British School in January. It remains only for me to thank the staff and residents of the School for creating such a warm and convivial atmosphere in which to work. Andrew Manson (Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University) ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELDWORK SUPPORT Castelporziano - Vicus Augustanus 2004 A short season was held in June, made possible by generous assistance in kind from the British School at Rome, the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Ostia and the Tenuta Presidenziale di Castelporziano. Work continued on the detailed surface survey of site B2, a long ridge located between the Vicus and the boundary with Castelfusano, tentatively</page><page sequence="12">284 RESEARCH REPORTS identified in 2003 as a porticus along the ancient sea front. In 2004 the structure was traced for a total length of c. 180 m, stopping just short of site Bl (the 'Villa del Confine'). Trial trenches revealed the footings of four parallel walls, the seaward three forming a porticus and the fourth perhaps bounding a garden to the rear. Two phases were evident, the first in reticulate dating from the first century ad; the second in brick and tufelli of the mid-second century ad, involving a rise in floor level on top of substantial deposits of sand, and moving the facade closer to the sea. This later seaward elevation had multiple buttresses along its base and was embellished with semi-columns, framing large windows. At the Vicus, the excavation of Building Y progressed in depth both within and without the building. A drain was found under the floor level on the inside of one room, apparently an unpaved yard. Excavations on the outside demonstrated that the eastern flank of the building had been built into the ruins of walls apparently brought down by earthquake. The function of the building remains unclear. On the post-excavation front, Dr Kim Ayodeji reorganized and reinventoried the finds' store, creating a searchable database; Dr John W. Hayes continued his studies of the pottery and amphorae; and Dr Angela Wardle (MoLSS) completed a study of the glass. Amanda Claridge and Jari Pakkanen (Classics Department, Royal Holloway, University of London) Roman urbanism in Italy The project is continuing to deploy a combination of surface-survey techniques to characterize Roman urban sites in Italy. In September 2004 survey work was undertaken on three sites - Otricoli, Falerii Novi and Fregellae - , while further sites in northern Campania and southern Lazio were visited for evaluation. At Otricoli (Umbria) the detailed topographic survey of the site was completed and further geophysical survey was undertaken. Magnetometry has now been completed, with the exception of one field where work was not possible because of crop cover. In addition, Salvatore Piro of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche successfully completed a georadar survey in the central area. The work undertaken since 2002 has now provided a clear understanding of the topography and development of this complex site, and has helped to provide a proper context for the monuments excavated in the eighteenth century. Further magnetometry was undertaken at Falerii Novi (Lazio) beside the Via Amerina, immediately outside the North Gate. This work was designed to complement that published previously and the recently published aerial photographic survey. The cemetery areas were fully surveyed and a series of features, including land allotments and mausolea, was mapped. Two very large rectangular rock-cut features were identified, but their characterization will require further investigation by georadar. In southern Lazio and northern Campania several sites were evaluated to establish their potential for extensive survey. At Fregellae we worked with Professor Filippo Coarelli's team to provide detailed information about the site's potential. Three separate blocks of magnetometry were completed to the southwest of the Archaeological Park. This work revealed part of the forum, structures flanking it and what can probably be interpreted as related land divisions. The work unquestionably demonstrated that a full survey of the town would be worthwhile.

The work carried out in the first four years (reported annually in this section oí Papers of the British School at Rome) had shown that it was occupied by a Roman village that had its origins in the late Republic if not before (there is some pottery of the fourth century bc redeposited in later contexts), and which expanded greatly in the early Empire.The entire site occupies an area of nearly 4 ha, and is divided into two parts, north and south, by a ravine. In the early and middle Empire the settlement was concentrated in the north part, and the cemetery was located in the south part; in late antiquity the nucleus was transferred to the south part, and burials began to be made in the north part. Iron was worked in both parts of the settlement, and there were numerous kilns for firing tiles located on either side of the ravine, which were in use, probably one or two at a time, from early in the first century ad to late in the fourth century ad. The village formed part of a much larger estate - a saltus consisting of forest and rough grazing - , which was the property of the emperor (Small, Volterra and Hancock, 2003). Field-survey evidence suggests that it amounted to at least 30.6 km2 (Small and Small, in press). The aims of the 2004 season were threefold: to recover as much as possible of the plan of the buildings that formed the core of the village in the late antique period; to continue the excavation of the cemetery; and to complete the field survey within the probable boundaries of the estate. The late antique buildings were identified by the magnetometer survey carried out for the BSR by Kris Strutt in 2000. The soil conditions at Vagnari are not ideally suited for magnetometry, and the plan tentatively inferred from the geophysics has needed to be tested at many points. Four trenches already excavated had revealed about a third of the buildings. Three more large trenches and seven smaller ones were opened in 2004 to fill in details of the plan and recover more information on the function of the structures. Much of the work was carried out by students of the University of Foggia sent by Giuliano Volpe, and directed on site by Pasquale Favia and Roberta Giuliani; and an important contribution was made by students from the University of Edinburgh and from Mount Allison University in New Brunswick under the direction of Hans vanderLeest. Enough has now been excavated to allow the plan of the structures to be reconstructed with virtual certainty. There were two buildings, with slightly different alignments, begun at different times. The earlier, to the west, was a rectangular structure measuring c. 9 x 14 m, divided into two halves. The southern half was a workshop connected with a smelting furnace and smithy located outside it to the west, partially excavated in 2000 and 2001. The badly preserved remains of the furnace were excavated in 2004 by the Cooperativa Ares of Gravina as part of this project. On the other, east, side of the building there was a passageway paved with cobbles, and beyond it the second, larger, building that was nearly square, measuring 16 x 17 m in plan. In the centre of this there was a covered courtyard, surrounded on all four sides by aisles and lit, presumably, by a clerestory. An entrance porch, or more probably portico, was attached to the south front, with a doorway wide enough to admit carts. The aisle on the north side of the central courtyard was used for animals. This was therefore a large functional building, perhaps connected with the administration of taxes in kind in late antiquity. The ceramic evidence for the beginning and end of the complex is still being studied, but a worn coin of Valentinian II, datable to ad 388-92 (identification by Richard Abdy), shows that the smithy was in operation some time after that period, and a date in the fifth century is supported by radiocarbon analyses.</page><page sequence="14">286 RESEARCH REPORTS The excavations of 2004 produced more evidence for the subsequent phase of occupation that had already been identified in 2001. It consists of the socle, formed of stones loosely bonded in earth, of a small rectangular hut inserted in the northeast corner of the former building. It was in turn replaced by another hut with an apsidal end in similar masonry. It is hoped that radiocarbon analyses will help to determine the date of these successor buildings. The excavation in the cemetery was carried out largely by a team from McMaster University, Ontario, under the direction of Tracy Prowse, who is studying the human osteology. In the previous two years of excavation, 27 burials had been uncovered. Nine more were excavated in 2004 in a new trench laid out immediately adjacent to the area already excavated, and a tenth, identified in 2002 but left unexcavated then for lack of time, was located again and opened. The total area explored now covers 186 m2. Since most of the burials excavated in 2004 were situated in the eastern part of the trench adjacent to those already known, it seems likely that the edge of the cemetery in this direction has now been reached. All the burials excavated in 2004 were inhumations, except for the edge of a cremation burial - the only one of its kind - excavated in 2003 that impinged on the new trench. Most of the graves were covered by tiles arranged 'a cappuccina' in the form of a ridge-tent, the most common form of grave cover at Vagnari. One, however, was closed by tiles laid horizontally and surmounted by a funnel for libations, the second most common type of grave at the site. Most of the graves excavated this year were of adults. One contained two individuals deposited at different times. Two graves adjacent to each other held a young adult female and small child, presumably mother and son or daughter. Most of the dead were accompanied by grave-goods, some of which must have had ritual or magical functions. The custom of depositing a single large nail in a pot inside a burial, already known at Vagnari, was attested again in four of the burials excavated in 2004. The study of the artifacts and of the skeletal remains, and of the burial practices they represent, is still in progress. As in previous years, the field survey was directed by Carola Small, assisted in 2004 by Sterling Vinson of Pima Community College Arizona, and by a small group of student volunteers from Gravina, several of whom have taken part in the project for two or more years. The aim of the project in 2004 was to complete the area of roughly 25 km2 bounded by the geographical features that form the most probable limits of the imperial estate: the river Basentello to the west, the Via Appia to the northeast, the stream of the Pentecchia di Chimienti to the east, and the drove-road from Gravina to the Lucanian Apennines to the south. The team of 2004 covered an area of c. 6.85 km2, in the southeast part of this zone. Most of it was devoid of sites of the imperial period, confirming the impression that the estate consisted largely of uninhabited saltus; but two settlements of the period were found in an adjacent area, which probably lay outside the boundary formed by the Via Appia (the course of which is not precisely known in this area). Philip Kenrick continued his study of the pottery from the site and survey, assisted by Alessandra De Stefano and (for the amphorae) by Giacomo Disantarosa, both graduate students at the University of Foggia. Progress was made also on the consolidation of the finds, especially the metalwork from the burials, by Antonia Petrafesa of Gravina. No excavation has been planned for 2005, while work is in progress on publishing the results to date.
