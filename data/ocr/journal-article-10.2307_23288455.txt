<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Cross-cultural Dialogue: A Case Study of Pre-Mughal Mosques in Delhi JYOTI P. SHARMA The Indian subcontinent saw the arrival of the Muslim in about 1000 AD. By the thirteenth century Muslim rule, referred to as the Delhi Sultanate, was established. The advent of Islam brought novel building types, of which the mosque was the most significant. Accompanying the building types was a range of pre-established elements of design, building techniques, materials and motifs. This overseas package combined with the indigenous craftsmen's skills to forge a new way of building. It would be rather unfair to project the style of building as a uniform package for the entire subcontinent given the several strands of regional nuances that existed simultaneously. This paper limits itself to outlining the evolution of the cross-cultural mutation as exemplified \ in the design of mosques in pre-Mughal Delhi. Islamicization of the Indian Subcontinent - Sufi Eclecticism What brought the Muslim adventurers to the subcontinent was the legendary wealth of India. Their expeditions, which can be traced to the beginning of the eleventh century, were generally forays that were aimed at plundering the region's wealth, instead of being driven by a vision of establishing a universal Islamic state. Such a vision which led to their making the Indian subcontinent a permanent home, did not mature for another 200 years. By the thirteenth century Muslim rule was established in the northern part of the subcontinent facilitated by native conditions that were in a state of total disarray. The attacks of the Muslims were confronted by the Rajput kingdoms of the north-western part of the subcontinent. The famed Rajput valour was no match for the military might of the invaders, as the Rajputs failed to counter the enemy as a unified whole, plagued as they were by constant internecine feuds. The invaders settled in the northern part of the subcontinent in the region around Delhi and their regime is referred to by historians as the 'Delhi Sultanate', Delhi being selected as the seat of imperial power. Geographically speaking, the Delhi region experiences a hot and humid climate for a substantial part of the year. In such a situation, the reaction of the Muslim invaders, who came from either cold mountainous regions or from the hot and dry deserts, to the heat and humidity of the Indian plains where they had settled, could have been far from favourable, a fact that was likely to have a significant bearing on their building practices in the subcontinent. The Muslim regime, in the initial years, adopted an almost apathetic stance towards its indigenous subjects with the thought of proselytization not being an immediate priority. The Muslim state therefore had an overwhelmingly large Hindu population BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 249</page><page sequence="2">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY (Thapar, 1990). The indigenous converts by and large belonged to the lower rungs of the Hindu caste order. They perceived the Islamic view, pertaining to the equality of all men, as an attractive proposition to rid themselves of their own caste affiliations. Conversions from the upper echelons of the Hindu fold were triggered off more by opportunism to curry favour with the Muslim rulers than by religious zeal. Therefore, the impassive attitude of the state acted as a deterrent towards mass conversions, resulting in the Muslims being in a minority, in a Muslim state. The credit for an increase in their ranks, through large-scale Islamicization of the subcontinent goes to non imperial missionary sources. The Sufi brotherhoods (silsilas), subsequent to their institutionalization in Persia, en couraged their orders to leave their homeland to carry forth the message of God. Of the various dervish orders, the fraternity of Qadiriyya, Suhrawardiya, Naqshbandiyya and Chishtiyya made the Indian subcontinent their home (Rizvi, 1987). They settled in the numerous villages and towns of the subcontinent, and rose above religious and communal biases, to address issues per taining to the interests of humanity. They shunned theocratic dogma and instead ex plored new ways of spiritual uplift and their pious and frugal living attracted a great deal of attention and subsequent following. The spirit of cultural eclecticism that was the cornerstone of Sufi thought fostered a coming together of two disparate religious beliefs. This process of exchange between Islamic and Hindu traditions was widespread and a deep rooted phenomenon. What changed hands at first were ritual aspects associated with birth, marriage and death, followed by the more mundane activities. From matters concerned with daily living, this cross cultural interface percolated to the domain of art and architecture. Here, as in all other areas of interaction, the cross-cultural dialogue was tempered by the regional nuances to generate a multi-hued expression in the subcontinent. It would therefore be unfair to project this exchange as having a uniform pattern. This paper limits itself to appreciating this cultural exchange as exemplified through the mosques built in pre-Mughal Delhi. Architecture of Muslim India - Cross-cultural Mutations As a religion, Islam had a cataclysmic growth, which did not leave any room for the evolution of its own arts and architectural vocabulary. The arts of Islam therefore borrowed techniques and details of ornament from the cultures it subjugated (Godard, 1965). That no conscious attempt was made to formulate an architectural tradition representative of Islam, could perhaps also be attributed to the faith's Founder's rather discouraging views on the act of building seen as a wasteful enterprise (Tillotson, 1990). As a result, the prototype for the principal building type of the religious institution, the mosque, was provided by the Founder's own modest dwelling in Medina. As the religion grew beyond the shores of Arabia, there resulted a borrowing of architectural forms from areas under Islamic domination with traditions different from its own. By the time Islam gained a foothold in the Indian subcontinent, it had built up a vocabulary of art and architecture comprising elements drawn from various cultural sources that were adapted into its fold with time. On the other hand, the subcontinent was a centre of a highly evolved, though vastly dissimilar culture that was capable of making a contribution to the repertoire of Islamic art and architecture. That an exchange could take place was ensured by sufi thought that provided a fertile breeding ground for novel forms of expression. Thus the subcontinent would be witness to the coming together of two totally different architectural traditions, the Islamic and the indigenous. Agents of Change on the Indian Landscape With the coming of Islam, came novel 250 BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3</page><page sequence="3">A CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOGUE: A CASE STUDY OF PRE-MUGHAL MOSQUES IN DELHI building types that were representative of a common architectural code that prevailed throughout the Muslim world. Of all the building types that were associated with Islam, the mosque was by far the most prominent. As a religious institution, the mosque was a place of prayer, both at the level of an individual and of the congregation. The building of a mosque carried with it the single Qur'anic stipulation that the anthropomorphic rendering of God and animate forms was taboo. To this was added another injunction by the Founder that the faithful must orient themselves towards the holy city of Mecca for prayer. In the case of the subcontinent, this translated into the west orientation for a mosque. The architectural expression that determined the physicality of a mosque as a house of God was already evolved by the time Islam made inroads into the subcontinent. Associated with it were pre-established elements of design, namely the pointed arch and the dome; and built forms such as the minaret and the four-iwan plan, that had a pan-Islamic appeal. Their appearance in a mosque made its physical form relevant to the Muslim world at large. Although, the origin of these features can be traced to disparate cultures, they were firmly entrenched in the vocabulary of Muslim religious architecture by the twelfth century, the time by which the mosque began to make its appearance on the Indian scene. The physical form of the dome and the minaret was endowed with high visual appeal as they served as spatial markers of a holy space and determined orientation in the surrounding landscape. Now both the dome and the minaret vied with the Hindu temple towers called shikharas as strong vertical elements against the horizontal spread of the settlement. The mosque as a container of holy space did not limit its sacredness to within its own confines. Instead, this sacred quality emanated in all directions as the five calls to prayer punctuated each day from morning to night, urging the devout to pray. Therefore the appearance of the mosque in the subcontinent altered the space of a settlement both visually and sonorously. The Native Artisan's Predicament In order to give a concrete shape to their building programme, the Muslim rulers did not rely on artisans brought from their own homeland. Instead, the building work was largely entrusted to the native artisans after some initial briefing by the Muslim patrons. For craftsmen trained in the indigenous tradition of building, Islamic building types, particularly the mosque, must have been a source of great surprise. For one, there was the absence of any strict textual guidelines for design, like their own stupendous tomes on temple architecture. The only mandate that was in force came from the Qur'an that forbade the representation of God and living creatures, and from the Founder regarding the mosque's orientation. Secondly, the patrons' notions regarding building were marked by a flexibility that allowed the artisans sufficient leeway for interpretation especially in the early years. The complete absence of any other regulating measure demanded by Islam released the artisan from the confines of canonization of the kind their own religion had put on them (Nath, 1976). This broadening of architectural vision notwithstanding, they must have been baffled by the relatively casual approach towards the erection of a sacred building, in this case the mosque. The native artisan's mind had been conditioned through time immemorial never to accord equal importance to non-religious structures. What perhaps must have compounded their bewilderment was the fact that that their Muslim patrons did not in the least mind recycling the components of temples to kick start their own building enterprise in the subcontinent. The Disparate Building Traditions Indigenous and Foreign The tradition of building in the subcontinent BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 251</page><page sequence="4">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY was a highly evolved art that had been practised over centuries of constructional enterprise. For generations, the native craftsmen had been building structures using the trabeate construction system, which relied on columns and beams for load transfer. The indigenous architecture was therefore an architecture of mass and its visual appeal lay in its heavy and ponderous quality (Lannoy, 1999). The architecture system emphasized the rootedness of a building with the earth, by tying the structure down by its sheer bulk. Therefore, the building built in the indigenous tradition, while conforming to the sacred codes, was a monolithic mass sculpted in stone. Hie structural elements that were fashioned from stone were assembled without any mortar, the enormous self weight of stone assuring that they remained in place. The artisans had also devised a method of corbelling stone by overlapping the successive courses to cover spans with a roof that followed a pyramidal profile. This type of roof was used largely over temple assembly halls where a flat ceiling was not desired. Through years of handling, stone, in the hands of the Indian craftsmen, became like molten wax. It was carved extensively and intricately both in relief and in three-dimensional sculpture. The visual appeal of the built-form relied on the interplay between the carved projecting and receding planes whose monochromatic hue was dramatized by the way the surface reacted to light. The various elements of design, such as the columns and beams, brackets, roof overhang (chajja) and roof of the temple (shikhara) were canonized in the texts to facilitate the implementation of a sacred concept into a three-dimensional reality. It should therefore come as no surprise that the arrival of the overseas Islamic package of design elements and built forms, generated an ambiguous response, for this import was at complete variance with the established repertoire of the indigenous tradition. Muslim architecture was an architecture of structure that relied on the arcuate system of construction, whose principal design elements were the arch and the dome. Additionally, this system advocated the use of mortar as a binding material, the latter adding to the architectural novelties that came to the subcontinent with the advent of Islam. The disposition of the design elements, namely the arch and the dome, in Muslim buildings was an outcome of a series of experiments in construction rather than a well-defined set of codes. Unlike its Indian counterpart that emphasized mass, Muslim architecture was based on the idea of its very negation (A1 Faruqi and A1 Faruqi, 1986). A visual weightlessness was induced in the building by attempting to dissolve its structure. This was achieved by an elaborate overlay of decorative materials or the use of design elements such as muqarnas. The widely accepted building materials of the Muslim world, like brick and encaustic tiles, the latter a popular medium of overlay, were a novelty to the subcontinent. Here the abundance of stone had led to the perfection of the technique of working it to coax it into a seemingly limitless variety of forms. Additionally, the arcuate system of construction was not employed by the native builders as there was a clear cut preference for its canonized trabeated counterpart. The ingenuity of the artisan now lay in forging a compatible relationship between these two largely different architectural traditions. A New Grammar of Ornament Surface decoration in pre-Muslim India served a narrative role with its vast gamut of components conveying a sense of time and space. Islamic art, on the other hand, with its injunctions against figural representation was not narrative in nature. Only calligraphic inscriptions had a literary significance for the literate onlooker. Islamic decoration was independent of the form, scale, material and function of the object, whether a building surface or a jug, being pan-Islamic in nature. The elements of decoration that made their 252 BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3</page><page sequence="5">A CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOGUE: A CASE STUDY OF PRE-MUGHAL MOSQUES IN DELHI way to the subcontinent included primarily calligraphy, geometric abstraction and arabesque and had been used extensively to decorate construction in the land of their birth. Complementing the two-dimensional quality of Islamic ornament was the centuries-old native tradition of sculpture in the round as evolved and perfected through temple architecture. The indigenous elements comprised both figural and non figural subjects that were drawn from India's own repository of built heritage whose surface these elements had helped relieve over centuries. The non-figural ornament comprised the abstract and rhythmic wave like patterns using curves, floral creepers with sinuous outlines and a host of symbolic forms like the lotus, the six pointed star and the bell and chain motif. The popular themes of figural representation that found a place in Muslim secular buildings in the subcontinent included animal forms like the elephant, peacock and swan together with composite animals (Nath, 1976). Islamic decoration unlike its Indian counterpart, relied on line work and colour to relieve building mass through techniques such as mosaic and painting. These in conjunction with the indigenous time-tested technique of carving stone led to the emergence of a new aesthetic. The process of adaptation was equally valid for the home bred inputs encountering new building forms as well as for the external inputs encountering new locales. The initial attempts were somewhat measured perhaps to fathom the new techniques and materials. As an outcome, carving in stone and moulding in stucco took precedence over other methods resulting in a three dimensional exuberance. This was in all likelihood an outcome of the native artisan's unleashed passion for covering entire building surfaces with profuse and exquisite carving. With the passage of time, the outside influences began to make inroads as the new techniques were comprehended and workability was honed. The Delhi Sultanate - An Overview The permanent association of the Muslims with the northern part of the subcontinent can be traced to the last decade of the twelfth century, when Muhammad bin Sam, the Ghori ruler, conquered Delhi after defeating the Rajputs. The Delhi region was a flat plain whose limits were topographically defined by the river Jamuna and a spur of the Aravalli hills, to enclose a triangular tract of land. It was strategically poised between the mountains to its north-west from where the Muslim invaders had arrived, the vast Gangetic plains to its east and the Thar desert to its west. The region was surrounded by a fertile hinterland and lay at the heart of both the riverine and overland trade routes. With attributes such as these, it is hardly surprising that the Muslim invaders chose the Delhi region as their permanent home. The first Muslim dynasty to rule the region was the Mamluk or Slave dynasty (1206-1290) in the thirteenth century, whose founder was Qutub-ud-din Aibak. After ruling for about a century, the Mamluks were replaced by the Khaljis (1290-1320) as the Sultans. They extended the domain of their territory to occupy a vast area of the subcontinent. However, their reign was relatively short and the Khaljis were overthrown by the Tughlak dynasty (1320-1412) in the early fourteenth century. The dynasty was founded by Ghias ud-din Tughlak, who was the governor of Debalpur, near Multan in the north-west, who ascended the throne at Delhi. The Tughlak dynasty held sway for close to ninety years and its rule was marked by the plundering of Delhi at the hand of Tamerlane, the grandson of Genghis Khan, in 1398. Out of the chaos that prevailed following the Timurid invasion, the Sayyid dynasty (1414-1451) came to power at the beginning of the fifteenth century. Its reign of less than half a century was a continuous struggle for survival. The Sayyids were succeeded by the Lodhi dynasty (1451-1526) which after a rule of a quarter of a century was overthrown by Babar, who BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 253</page><page sequence="6">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY laid the foundation of the Mughal rule in the subcontinent in 1526 (Desai, 1986). The Evolution of the Mosque in Pre-Mughal Delhi Islam demanded that the foremost structure to be built on conquered territory was to be the house of prayer or the mosque. Therefore in accordance with this stipulation, the mosque for the worshippers of the Faith became the most important building type. The rulers of the Delhi Sultanate along with their nobility were the chief patrons with each ruling dynasty contributing to the number of mosques that were built in Delhi as the number of faithful increased from the early days of the advent of Islam. The traditional urban relationship between the mosque and the market or the imperial seat, was eschewed in the subcontinent due to the overwhelmingly large population of non-Muslims. Each dynasty would aim towards siting its mosques in close proximity to the Muslim community, who constituted its patrons. The great building scale was also meant to proclaim the might of the new Faith in a land of non-Muslims, apart from holding the congregation. The first mosque, the Quwat ul-Islam Masjid was raised on the site of Hindu temples belonging to the former rulers of the area, the Rajputs. The other mosques in the Delhi region were built on virgin sites. Due to the limited information, it is difficult to ascertain whether the mosque came first and the settlement grew around it or vice versa. According to the Hindu texts, however, the temple ruins upon which the first mosque was built should have been ideally oriented east-west, with the deity sitting in the sanctum sanctorum to face east. This orientation would have suited the Muslims who turned west to pray. It is possible to trace the evolution of the mosque as a building type employing two different architectural inputs. Fortunately, a sizeable number of mosques belonging to the pre-Mughal era still survive in Delhi. Most of these have been declared protected monuments to which the public has access, while some are privately owned and still actively used for worship. This study will examine the process of evolution of the pre-Mughal mosques in a chronological sequence. It will use as examples some of the existing mosques to help strengthen our understanding of the nuances of the cross cultural dialogue initiated in this part of the subcontinent in the twelfth century. The Mamluk Contribution The onus of initiating the Muslim building programme in the subcontinent rested with the Mamluks, by virtue of their being the first imperial power of the Delhi Sultanate. Their reign witnessed the establishment of the rudiments of a new way of building as an interface between the indigenous and foreign building tradition. Quwat-ul Islam Masjid The founder of the Mamluk dynasty, Sultan Qutub-ud-din Aibak, undertook the construction of a mosque for the worshippers of the Faith in Delhi in the late twelfth century This mosque was called the Quwat-ul Islam (Might of Islam) Masjid, as it signalled the arrival of the Faith in the subcontinent and thus marked the first stage in the evolution of the mosque in Delhi. The mosque was built on a raised plinth and comprised an open enclosure surrounded by a colonnade. The west side was enlarged to form the main prayer hall in the direction of Mecca. In the subsequent years, the western prayer hall was emphasized by erecting in front of it a free standing screen of arches. The mosque was further enlarged by the founder's successor, Sultan Iltutmish, to almost three times the original size by throwing another colonnaded enclosure around the mosque and stretching the arched screen across the extended prayer hall. Curiously, this method of extension was very similar to building circumambulatory 254 BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3</page><page sequence="7">A CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOGUE: A CASE STUDY OF PRE-MUGHAL MOSQUES IN DELHI passages called Parikarmas, around the main shrine in a Hindu temple, the process usually resulting in a number of concentric enclosures (Grover, 1996). That Sultan Aibak was in a hurry to raise the mosque can be testified by the fact that the building material was not sourced from a quarry but came from the spoils of Hindu temples (see Figure 1). In order to comply with the Qur'anic injunction regarding the presence of animate figures, the builders of the mosque defaced the figural sculptures that the temple columns and beams carried (see Figure 2). Further, this recycling of temple parts also sent out the message of the power and authority of the new rulers Figure 1. Colonnade of Quwat-ul Islam Masjid. Figure 2. Detail of a column with defaced figural sculptures, Quwat-ul Islam Masjid. and the assertion of their Faith. The column and beams were used to build the colonnade, often columns were superimposed if a single member fell short of the desired height, particularly at the ends of the eastern colonnade. Here an intermediate level was inserted to provide a prayer chamber for women. The colonnade was then roofed with beams and flat stone panels. The prayer hall had five shallow domes built by the corbelling method that was known to the native craftsmen. The stepped pyramidal form of the roof that resulted was then covered with a thick layer of plaster to generate the profile of a shallow dome. The screen of arches erected before the prayer hall was yet another example of indigenous techniques being applied to suit Islamic conventions. The need for this screen was an afterthought that probably came about to introduce in an otherwise trabeate structure, an arcuate element for a reassertion of the structure's Figure 3. Arched screen across the prayer hall, Quwat-ul Islam Masjid. Figure 4. Detail of carving on screen, Quwat-ul Islam Masjid. BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 255</page><page sequence="8">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY Islamic identity. The screen initially with five arches was built much too tall in comparison to the surrounding colonnade (see Figure 3). Besides, the arches were made by the corbelling technique and followed it up by chiselling away the stone edges to create the smooth arched profiles. The courtyard of the mosque had an iron pillar belonging to an ancient Hindu temple that was believed to have been set there by one of the Rajput rulers of Delhi (Sharma, 1990). This pillar was left untouched, perhaps its image of timeless invincibility was now associated with the new Faith. Outside the first enclosure the Sultan also initiated the construction of the lofty Qutub Minar that not only served the purpose of calling the faithful to prayer, but was also loaded with the powerful symbolism of the might of Islam in a predominantly Hindu region. The Qutub Minar was detached from the original enclosure but it overlooked it from the south east corner. However, the extension carried out by Sultan Iltutmish enclosed it within the new quadrangle. The decorative skills of the indigenous artisans were best manifest in the arched screen whose rubble masonry core was finished with red sandstone that was covered with carvings. Here calligraphy was interspersed with a naturalistic representation of luxuriant foliage (see Figure 4). However, this exuberant burst of energy was somewhat held in check by the time the extension to the mosque and the screen was made, for here the ornamentation was restrained. Evidently, the stone carvers were adapting to the new aesthetic demands. The Khalji Contribution By the time the Khalji dynasty came to power, close to a hundred years had elapsed since the building of the Quwat-ul Islam Masjid. The building tradition had also overcome its rather shaky start and had begun to evolve into a more refined style. The most important development was that the technique of making an Islamic arch and dome was learnt and put to use in various building types. Extension to the Quwat-nl Islam Masjid The Qutub Mosque enclosure was extended yet again by the Khalji Sultan, Ala-ud-din Khalji by throwing another colonnade around the previous extension to accommodate a much larger congregation. The Sultan had a grand architectural vision as the mosque was enlarged to six times its original size. In addition, the colonnade was provided with entrance gateways, of which the southern gate, called the Alai Darwaza still stands. The enclosure also contained the Alai Minar, envisioned by the Sultan as a befitting reply to its predecessor, the Qutub Minar. However, what concerns us here is the design of the Alai Darwaza based on an interplay of a lower cubical and an upper hemispherical volume, that marked a progression from the days of an archaeological medley of temple parts to a refinement in form, structure and decoration. Jamat Khana Masjid The Jamat Khana (congregational place) Masjid was built by the son of Sultan Ala-ud din Khalji, Khizr Khan. It was built within the precincts of the Dargah of the highly venerated sufi saint, Hazrat Nizam-ud-din Auliya. Unlike the Qutub Mosque, the Jamat Khana Masjid was meant to hold a relatively modest congregation. It occupied the western side of the courtyard of the Dargah, with the tomb of the saint occupying the centre. From the Qutub Mosque to the Jamat Khana Masjid was a big leap in terms of the evolution of the mosque form. The Jamat Khana Masjid took the form of only a prayer hall that was an enclosed oblong volume. The prayer hall was rectangular in plan with three bays, where the colonnade of the Qutub Mosque gave way to solid masonry walls. Each bay of the mosque if considered individually, seemed to have borrowed its form from the Alai Darwaza (Desai, 1986). Each 256 BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3</page><page sequence="9">A CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOGUE: A CASE STUDY OF PRE-MUGHAL MOSQUES IN DELHI bay was crowned by domes with the central dome being higher and supported on arched squinches similar to those in the Alai Darwaza, while the flanking domes rested on triangular pendentives. The facade of the mosque finished in red sandstone no longer relied on a screen for emphasis. Rather the facade was articulated in the manner of the screen as a set of three arches, each corresponding to a bay Needless to say the arches were no longer made by corbelling. The ornamentation was restricted to providing a band of calligraphy around each arch, whose intrados was also adorned with a fringe of what closely resembled a garland of lotus buds. Perhaps this was an attempt to relieve the severity of the arch form. Although by now the native craftsmen had learnt the technique of making the arch and the dome, yet they were unable to abandon completely their own indigenous design vocabulary Under the central arch, was introduced an element in the form of a beam supported on brackets, clearly of indigenous origin, whose functional validity was only as an element to support a perforated stone screen, inserted between the arch and the beam. This device was hereafter to have an almost consistent presence in all types of Pre-Mughal buildings, not just mosques. The Tughlak Contribution The Tughlaks introduced a new style of building whose premise was simplicity of form and austerity of material and ornament. This could perhaps be attributed to the fact that the founder of the dynasty, was earlier the Governor of Debalpur, in Multan under the Khalji rule. Most building types in that region were meant for defence, hence they required strong fortifications. Additionally, the structures were made in brick, thereby causing the walls to be strengthened by buttressing (Grover, 1996). This feature was carried by the Tughlaks from Multan to their buildings in Delhi. Of the mosques built under the Tughlak rulers, those built during the reign of the third king, Feroz Shah Tughlak, survive. The King, a prolific patron of architecture, teamed up with his Vazir to build several mosques in Delhi that share some common characteristics and belong to the later Tughlak era. The use of red sandstone initiated by the Khaljis was rejected. Instead structures were now built in rubble masonry and finished with stucco and sometimes with coloured encaustic tiles. The walls had a battered profile and were also additionally supported by attached turrets. The arch and the beam on bracket element that was introduced in the Jamat Khana Masjid became a feature of Tughlak mosques. Decoration was confined to moulding in stucco and was sparse with simple designs. Of the various mosques built in Delhi, two may be considered here on account of being based on different design approaches. Begampuri Masjid This was a congregational mosque like the Quwat-ul Islam Masjid. There is some Figure 5. Courtyard of Begumpuri Masjid. BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 257</page><page sequence="10">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY confusion regarding its patron with Feroze Shah Tughlak's predecessor and his Vazir vying for the credit of having commissioned such a vast structure (Rani, 1991). The building was raised on a plinth and had a large open quadrangle surrounded by an arched colonnade (see Figure 5). The north, south and east sides were pierced by three domed entrance gateways with only the eastern gate with a flight of steps for access. The rest of the external walls had arched windows, some with the beam and bracket arrangement. Each gateway projected into the central courtyard to break the linearity of the long colonnaded facade. The main prayer hall also had an arched colonnade across its length with the central bay raised higher than the rest and provided a battered profile to form a curious design element that has been referred to as a 'pylon' by historians. The pylon had a tall arch contained in a rectangular frame and was flanked by two attached turrets. A series of three smaller arched openings led into the interior that was crowned with a dome. This dome was however concealed by the tall pylon. The bays that enclosed the courtyard were all roofed with low domes resting on heavy stone columns carrying arches. The pylon was a new design element introduced in this mosque and it was subsequently adopted by the Sharqi rulers of the neighbouring kingdom of Jaunpur. A stone chajja resting on brackets ran along the courtyard, protecting the colonnade from the elements and also creating a play of light and shade on the facade. The decorative elements, though sparse, comprised the use of incised stucco and an overlay of blue glazed tiles. Khirki Masjid This mosque, built by the Vazir of Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlak, got its name from the arched windows (Khirkis) in the external walls fixed with a perforated stone lattice. Externally, the Khirki Masjid had a fortified appearance with a tapering circular bastion at each corner of its rectangular plan. The entire structure was raised on a high plinth with chambers at the lower level (see Figure 6). The entry into the mosque was by means of projecting gateways, also flanked by battered turrets, on three sides barring the west. The interior of the mosque was unusual in conception as instead of a single open courtyard, as seen in other congregational mosques, here there were four smaller versions. The rest of the space was covered by Figure 6. External view of Khirki Masjid. 258 BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3</page><page sequence="11">A CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOGUE: A CASE STUDY OF PRE-MUGHAL MOSQUES IN DELHI two rows of arcades running from the middle of the sides, in an east-west and north-south direction, conforming to a cruciform plan. The arcades were roofed by a combination of low domes and flat roofs supported on stone columns and arches. Evidently, the scorching sun of Delhi inspired the builders to cover up the courtyard leaving the four small courts for light and ventilation. However, the result was probably not satisfactory as this attempt was not repeated again in Delhi. In keeping with its formidable look, the entire structure was built in rubble and finished with thick stucco. Ornament was kept to a minimum and comprised moulding of simple patterns in the stucco. The Sayyid Contribution Following the invasion of Tamerlane, during the last days of the Tughlak era, the city of Delhi was devastated. Tamerlane not only carried booty in cash and kind, but also brought a large number of indigenous craftsmen who had been building in the sub continent, to now build for him at Samarqand. Additionally there were very few patrons left in Delhi who had the wherewithal to commission new building work. This state of affairs induced a forced migration of the remaining artisans to the provincial centres where they threw off their allegiance to the Delhi Sultanate and were ready to initiate building programmes. The Sayyid dynasty that came to power in Delhi after Tamerlane's invasion therefore had neither the requisite resources nor appropriate manpower to undertake architectural works that could vie with those of its predecessors. The short reign of the Sayyids of less than fifty years probably did not witness the building of any mosques as there are no surviving examples. However, it would be worthwhile to point out that the dynasty's main contribution to Pre-Mughal architecture lay in the development of tombs based on octagonal plans that were raised over their dead in Delhi. The Lodhi Contribution The three rulers of the Lodhi dynasty spent most of their time in subduing their adversaries. Therefore the building art was not accorded great priority. The reign of the Lodhis is marked primarily by the construction of tombs, just like their predecessors, the Sayyids. The contribution of the dynasty to the development of the mosque form, though small in terms of the actual numbers built, is significant in terms of its evolution. The Lodhi mosques built in Delhi were modest in scale and single aisled with three or five bays. This form is a departure from the large congregational mosques preferred by the former Sultanate dynasties. Although the reason for the appearance of this mosque form, which is rather sudden, in lieu of the congregational type is yet to be thoroughly understood, it was the precursor of the Mughal mosques. The builders of the Lodhi mosques were trying to shake off the Tughlak influence not only by arriving at a novel form but also by doing away with some elements of design in the search for a new solution. The result was that while the front facade of the prayer hall was liberated of the baggage of the past, the rear was still under the Tughlak influence as is evident from the two Lodhi era mosques considered below (Grover, 1996). Bara Gumbad Masjid This mosque was built in the late fifteenth century in the funerary garden of the Lodhis, now called the Lodhi Gardens. It was probably the first example of the new type. The mosque was rectangular in plan with five bays and was single-aisled. The facade had five arched openings with the central arch contained in a taller projecting frame and the whole being topped by a stone chajja resting on brackets (see Figure 7). Each arch was resolved into a series of flat receding planes that provided surfaces for decoration. The three central bays were topped with domes BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 259</page><page sequence="12">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY crowned with lotus finials, a feature that was to become a standard form of rendering the dome in Mughal mosques. The end bays had flat roofs. Projecting from the north and south walls and the centre of the Qibla wall were airy balconies with a ledge resting on brackets (see Figure 8). Attached to the corners and the niche (mihrab) projection of the Qibla wall were circular turrets crowned with an inverted lotus motif and with a batter that was indicative of the Tughlak influence. The decoration of the mosque relied on incised and painted stucco together with sparing use of coloured encaustic tiles. The elements of ornament included geometric and vegetal overlays and calligraphic inscriptions, the latter found prominently on the arches of the facade and the Qibla wall. The Bara Gumbad Masjid was a part of a larger group of buildings, all disposed around a raised central open space accessed by a flight of steps. Attached to the mosque at its southern end and at right angles to it was a tomb, the Bara Gumbad. Facing the mosque on the east was a hall whose appearance was similar to the mosque and it was called a Mehman Khana. Moth ki Masjid This mosque was built in the early sixteenth Figure 7. Facade of Bara Gumbad Masjid. century by Mian Bhuwa, a noble in the court of Sultan Sikandar Lodhi. Like its predecessor, the Bara Gumbad Masjid, this mosque was also a single-aisled, five bay structure. It was built on a raised platform with chambers at the lower level. Entry into the forecourt was by a flight of steps through an entrance gateway on the east. The eastern corners of the enclosure had domed pavilions, called chattris, an element of design of Rajput origin that was to become a regular feature in Mughal building types (see Figure 9). The prayer hall had five arched openings, the central finished in red sandstone, with a small arched opening above the arch. The chajja resting on brackets ran along the facade length. The roof was crowned with three domes with inverted lotus motif, one over the central bay and two over the end bays. The north and south walls had an arched opening on two levels with the upper one in the form of a projecting balcony, as in the Bara Gumbad Masjid. The Qibla wall had attached circular towers also on two levels with arched openings, while the prayer niche (mihrab) projection on the rear of the Qibla wall was buttressed by two turrets. For decoration, a combination of red sandstone, white marble, coloured glazed tiles and stucco, both incised and painted, was used. Calligraphy and arabesque were 260 BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3</page><page sequence="13">A CROSS-CULTURAL DIALOGUE: A CASE STUDY OF PRE-MUGHAL MOSQUES IN DELHI Figure 8.

The gateway in red sandstone, was profusely carved and had the beam and bracket arrangement. Conclusion The mosque as a building type was alien to the Indian subcontinent prior to the arrival of the Muslims. Once it was introduced, it underwent several mutations at the hands of the indigenous artisans building for their Muslim overlords. Externally, the identity of the mosque was often obscured by the presence of habitations of the settlement in close proximity, save for the minaret and the dome. Therefore to experience the spatial quality of the mosque, the structure demanded that the observer entered its Figure 9. Domed chattri at the corner of enclosure wall, Moth ki Masjid. internal space. Ihis internal space mrougn years of experimentation in the region of Islam's birth, had been marked by an airiness that connected the structure to the celestial realm rather than to the earth below on which it stood. With the coming of the mosque to the subcontinent, this airy feel was replaced by bulkiness. This change in spatial quality was an outcome of the indigenous building practices that through centuries had a bias towards the use of stone not only as a construction material, but also for surface articulation through carving. The subcontinent mosque with its heavy stone columns and arches, that were either left exposed or rendered in stucco tended to acquire a weighty look. This dispelling of the visual feel of weightlessness from the mosque in some cases even produced a dark and BUILT ENVIRONMENT VOL 28 NO 3 261</page><page sequence="14">ISLAM AND BUILT FORM: STUDIES IN REGIONAL DIVERSITY brooding space that seemed to capture some of the spirit of mystery that enveloped the sanctum sanctorum of the Hindu temple.
