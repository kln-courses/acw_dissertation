Contending that representations always have a material presence (be they spoken, depicted or anything else), an attempt is made to sort out how the specificity of this presence constitutes a frame of reference for the deployment of social action. Animal representations seem to be particularly related with certain materials, especially clay, and certain objects, mostly clay vessels. It is suggested that these objects allow animals to be incorporated in social action in a very specific manner, one that is further defined by the contexts of their use. Keywords Representation • Figurines • Animals • Materiality Introduction Animal representations from Neolithic Greece are currently interpreted as reflecting economic relations: studies agree that most of them represent domesticates, and thus, the imagery mirrors the importance that domesticates had in food procurement (e.g. Toufexis 2003: 268; see also Halstead 1999: 83). Animal representations, then, as indeed most if not all representations, are considered to be a byproduct of deeper relations, of a structure that reveals itself in images but is not constituted by them. In this vein, any differences in the way animals are represented can be explained away as different conceptualizations of the same world, which perseveres basically unaltered, regardless of the different opinions as to its structure. Apparently, this is a strategy that has been prominent for a long time, since the inception of archaeology, or anthropology for that matter. Alternatively, we could tackle these different conceptualizations as actually having an effect on the very constitution of the world, S.

Animal representations then could and, indeed, would affect the way economic or other sorts of relations are formed. This is not a novel idea. Anthropologists have argued for some time now that our categories are analytical devices that relate to the fact that anthropology (and archaeology) started as, and still is, a dominantly western discipline (see, for example, Strathern 1988; Thomas 2004). Our specific ways of making this world meaningful, our epistemologies, are more than just a means to know the world, they effectively produce a specific world; they are ontological discourses no better or more accurate than the next. It is not an issue of differing worldviews, so that we would need to find the best way to approach the real world lying beneath, but an issue of constant production of different worlds, of worlds inhabited not just by other subjects, but by entities of a different kind (Viveiros de Castro 2003; Henare et al. 2007). These worlds are produced as we inhabit them, by our continuous living as part of them and not just on top of them (Ingold 2000). As humans, we are not the sole constituents, or actors, in this process (Ingold 2000; Latour 2005). Furthermore, what is important is that there is no 'we' or 'they' or 'humans' or 'animals' or 'things' or whatever prior to this process. Subjects or objects (in our world), taonga or hau (in another world), are produced as part of this inhabitation. If this is the case, then the production of animal representations is about making the world inhabitable. That is, the production of these artifacts is part of a process of understanding the world, which is simultaneously constituted by this very under- standing. In this process, the particular materiality of these artifacts, the way they materialise and the contexts in which they materialise are all significant for the outcome: for the categories of the inhabitants (humans, animals, plants, rocks, etc.) that interact in any given world, the categories through which they interact and through which they acquire and negotiate an ontological status. An animal put to work is a whole different thing than an animal being eaten, although the same animal might transverse the two contexts. Animal figures are much more than the reflections of a postulated deep structure, and I will try to explore this point in relation to the artifacts known from Neolithic northern Greece (Fig. 1). Starting with some clarifications on the concept of representation, I will then go on to consider the various zoomorphic artifacts found in certain settlements in northern Greece. I will treat these representations as objects with particular use-lives and I will try, whenever possible, to tie them down to their contexts of invocation, arguing that these are the places where they forge their particular meaning and where they constitute the identity of the entities involved, their users included. In the course of this paper, I will argue that animal representations of Neolithic northern Greece had a specific material presence that contradicts generalised arguments about the depiction of domesticated species. Rather, in each case, their specific associations produced a different animal ontology, relevant to the particular contexts where the artifacts were used. Representations as Things Most researchers would subscribe to the notion that representations are not simplistic mirrors of society, although many treat them as such. It is also true that several £) Springer</page><page sequence="3">1 S6 Nanoglou Fig. 1 Map of northern Greece with sites mentioned in the text. studies have disregarded the material contingencies of representations, elevating them to the level of floating symbols that somehow exist independently of their invocations, revealing, so to speak, themselves out of a hidden substratum here and there (see discussion in Meskell 2007; Meskell et al. 2008). However, that does not mean, as some would have it, that representation is 'something other than itself (Olsen 2003: 93-94) as opposed to things-in-themselves. To accept this kind of equation, in order to argue against it (as in Olsen 2003), is to miss the point entirely, for nothing can be entirely itself, identical to itself, and everything is 'something other than itself (see Derrida 1982). To put it differently, to represent is to cite something else (Joyce 2000; Jones 2005; Boric 2005; Nanoglou 2005, 2006 for the concept of citation, all drawing upon J. Derrida and J. Butler), from which it follows that everything is, in a way, a representation of something else. It is a reference to a prior moment and inevitably a rearticulation of this moment (Laclau and Mouffe ^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">Animal Bodies and Ontological Discourse in the Greek Neolithic 187 2001). In this vein, every representation is nothing but a rearticulation of the world, the production of a new entity that pays homage to a prior one. In this vein also, representation is not opposed to the world as appearance or imagination vs reality (Henare et al. 2007: 13), but it is actually a constituent of the world(s) (see below). Representation commonly refers to resemblance, a sense that perhaps still adheres to a distinction between form and content, but we do not need to accept such a distinction. It is perhaps rewarding to think of resembling as a reassembling. If, following Latour (2005) and others, we understand every entity as a grouping, a fusion of practices, then representing such an entity in clay, stone or anything would only mean another grouping, another association, or in the words of W. Keane another bundling (Keane 2005). This bundling brings us again to the particularity of representations as material objects that occupy particular places in the world we live in (Meskell 2004, 2007). Sure, representations can and do describe, express, inform, influence, guide, define, etc., social practices, but they do so having a particular material presence in the world we inhabit, and thus, any description, expression, information, influence, guidance or whatever, can only be situated and conditioned. Their ability to contribute to social life is contingent upon the particular parameters of their material existence: what they are made of, how big and monumental or how small and easy to miss they are, whether they endure or perish or in what contexts they are entangled. The issue of context has remained prominent in archaeological discussions of the last 20 years or so. Early attempts to bring it forth (notably by Hodder 1986) have profoundly influenced the way we practise archaeology, even if certain qualifications need to be applied (see Barrett 1987). A problem encountered in many studies, though, is that context is taken to mean a passive background on which any object of study is projected. This is a problem not peculiar to archaeology (Dilley 2002). What is at stake here is that context tends to be invoked not as a product of action but as a canvas upon which action is deployed. In this case, action cannot intervene in the world and cannot change that context, for it is predetermined and unchangeable. Contrary to that, it is important to see context as an indeterminate field, as a set of articulations, of associations that pertain to the object of study, a set conditioned by that very object. In this vein, a claim for context is no different from a claim for materiality. To set material coordinates for something is to situate it in a never- closing system of associations, associations which, of course, can never be fully described or fully determined. It is from this partially constituted place that representations can be brought to bear upon people's lives or any other lives. But how are they affecting these lives? The argument that representations have a material presence, that they re-articulate the world, rather than reflect it, should not be taken as equivalent to the notion of objects that result in the production of certain concepts (as in the model of 'symbol before concept' advocated by Renfrew 1998 and 2001), which, in effect, sustains a division of mind and matter (Thomas 1998). There is no pre-discursive matter that is dressed over with meaning (Butler 1993, see also Henare et al. 2007) and we are certainly not outside this constituted world, in order to conceptualise it after the fact. In fact, subjects, objects and other entities emerge within an articulated world, which conditions their materialisation. People and other entities are equally part of this world (or many worlds), and signification is not a unilateral activity exercised by people onto everything else, as, for example, is £} Springer</page><page sequence="5">188 Nanoglou suggested by Knappett when he says that artifacts are imbued with agency and goes ahead to 'substitute "meaning" for agency' (Knappett 2002: 101). The process of signification is co-extensive with the process of materialisation, with the reiteration of practices that stabilise over time to produce an intelligible form (Butler 1993: 9). It is precisely the iterability of practices that makes them intelligible and significant (see Derrida 1979: 50, on the inherent iterability of signs), in which case, it follows that meaning does not reside with any singular subject or object per se (or with any singular word for that matter), but with their capacity to reiterate and re-articulate previous ones (see also Strathern 1998). If this is so, then the figures that cite humans or animals, or whatever, are precisely able to signify by way of their ability to re-articulate what is human or animal, or whatever. Accordingly, they affect people's lives as nodal points, as citational precedents (Joyce 2000), on which the constitution of these lives depends. Their materiality, their specific material presence, is consequently paramount for their meaning, since it exactly conditions their iterability. The Area Neolithic Greece is often considered unremarkable, due to the lack of spectacular finds similar to those known from areas to the east (Anatolia, Near East) or to the north (Balkans). Its place in prehistoric archaeology is largely conditioned by questions regarding the transmission of the 'Neolithic revolution' from east to west (Kotsakis 2002) and lately by a discussion concerning the symbolic character of tells (e.g. Kotsakis 1999; Halstead 1999). Tells are a prominent feature of the Neolithic built environment in the area, and indeed, many sites discussed in this paper are tells (Pefkakia, Chara 1, Platia Magoula Zarkou, Servia, Nea Nikomedeia, Dikili Tash, Sitagroi). During the last few years, though, another kind of settlement has made its appearance, mostly in Macedonia: flat extended settlements, that is, settlements where new habitation structures are placed not on top of the old (as in tells) but next to them, resulting in a more extensively and sparsely inhabited space (see Pappa 2008 for the most up-to-date discussion of such settlements). This type includes the settlements of Makriyalos, Vasilika and Dimitra from this study. These types of course are ideal analytical constructs and actual settlements may indeed integrate aspects of either one of them. Since extra-mural cemeteries are very rare, most of the artifacts referred to below come from settlement contexts. Different types of buildings usually characterise these two types of settlements. Remains on tells usually consist of the lower part of rectangular buildings, built of mud bricks with stone foundations or of wattle and daub around a skeleton of posts. Remains in extended settlements, on the other hand, usually consist of pits of varied size, which presumably are the basements of buildings now lost to erosion. These buildings were probably of wattle and daub too. Usual finds include pottery, stone tools, clay implements and figurines, along with bones and seeds. The occurrence of these categories varies with every settlement, and this variability crosscuts the difference between tells and extended settlements. An interesting aspect of some Neolithic settlements in northern Greece is the occurrence of spatial elements, like ditches, perimeter walls or large pits that seem to point to some communal practices £) Springer</page><page sequence="6">Animal Bodies and Ontological Discourse in the Greek Neolithic 1 89 either in constructing or using these features. Examples that will be cited in this paper include Dimini and Sesklo (Kotsakis 1996), Makriyalos (Pappa 2008) and Promachon-Topolnica (Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 2007). The Neolithic of Greece is commonly divided into three phases (Early, Middle and Late Neolithic, see Table I), with a fourth one added in some cases (the Final Neolithic; in some studies, this last phase is considered part of the Late Neolithic). Radiocarbon dates are known from some sites (Andreou et al. 1996; Reingruber and Thissen 2005), but dating is based mostly on pottery styles. Because of that, the Early and Middle Neolithic are not that easy to differentiate, unless in stratigraphic correlation, and consequently, I occasionally employ a more generic dating, integrating both phases under the term 'earlier Neolithic'. General Issues: Types of Artifacts Representing Animals in Neolithic Greece We can discern objects resembling animals, whether whole bodies or just a part of them, already in the earliest Neolithic settlements of Northern Greece. The production and use of such objects continued ceaselessly until the end of the Neolithic and, in certain areas, well beyond that. These objects have been mostly studied as part of figurine assemblages, along with the most numerous human ones, and their interpretation has followed the same trajectories: most of the time, they have been treated as a coherent group of artifacts that crosscuts community boundaries and emerges as a predefined cognitive category (mostly subsumed under the rubric of 'ideology', e.g. Hourmouziadis 1973; Skafida 1992; Kokkinidou and Nikolaidou 1997). Coupled with that, there seems to be a persistent reduction of all interpretative parameters to just one: the identification of which animals the images represent. All studies tend to commit to a detailed catalogue of identified species, which, ideally, will give away the reason for representing them. In this way, representations are driven to fit a predetermined ontology, whereby our criteria for distinguishing between animals are rendered transhistorical and natural. Contrary to that view, what concerns me here is to approach representations as constituting ontology, through establishing the very criteria for categorization. That said, I will build on previous studies and I will also focus primarily on a regional rather than a site-specific level. Animal imagery in Neolithic northern Greece is associated with three types of artifacts: (a) three-dimensional animal figurines (Fig. 2), (b) vessels with animal features (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) and (c) house models with animal heads protruding from Table I Phases of the Neolithic of Northern Greece (years in cal. bc) Early Neolithic 6700/6500-5800/5600 Earlier Neolithic Middle Neolithic 5800/5600-5400/5300 Late Neolithic I 5400/5300-5000/4900 Later Neolithic Late Neolithic II 5000/4900-4700/4500 Final Neolithic 4700/4500-3300/3 1 00 Data according to Andreou et al.

Related to the third category are cases of actual bucrania (i.e. bovine skulls), plastered with clay or not, and a clay life-size bucranium, which were probably part of a wall 'decoration' and are discussed below. Toufexis refers to two other categories: 'human figurines with animal features' and 'independent not whole-body animals' (Toufexis 1990, 2003: Fig. 29.1).

After Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al (2007): Fig. 25. animal features' consists, according to Toufexis, of two sub-groups: (a) humans with animal skins and (b) 'theriomorphic masks'. The examples of the first sub-group need not count as animal representations, while the 'theriomorphic masks' are neither masks nor anything more than animal heads, probably fragments of zoomorphic vessels (see, e.g. Toufexis 2003: Fig. 29.21). Indeed, the whole issue of masks in the imagery of Neolithic Greece (cf. Bailey 2005: 147-149, following Gimbutas) needs to be revisited. I would definitely argue that, for the moment, there is absolutely no indication that anything invoked the presence of a mask in Neolithic imagery (Nanoglou 2008b, note 4). A final example of this category, of a quadruped with a human-like head (Gallis and Orphanidis 1996: 406, no. 355), is rather ambiguous, as Toufexis himself confirms (2003: 264). In any case, human and animal heads are sometimes hard to distinguish in Greek Neolithic imagery (compare, for example, the figurines in Gimbutas 1986: plate LIX.l and plate LXI.l; see also below and Nanoglou 2008b). Regarding the last category (independent, not whole-body animals), Toufexis names only one figure (Toufexis £} Springer</page><page sequence="10">Animal Bodies and Ontological Discourse in the Greek Neolithic 1 93 2003: 29.13), but in his detailed catalogue (Toufexis 1990), he explicitly says that this is another example of an animal head protruding from a vessel. Consequently, I have not included these two categories in the discussion. Finally, the term 'figures' refers collectively to all types of representation. Specific Issues: Artifacts in Context Figurines Interestingly, in earlier Neolithic Greece, the percentage of animal figurines compared to all figurines within settlement assemblages is quite small: less than 10% (Nanoglou 2008a: 5). This percentage does not rise significantly during the later Neolithic (Table II, see also Toufexis 1993). There seem to be more animal figurines in eastern Macedonia (Dimitra, Sitagroi) than in Thessaly and western Macedonia (Pefkakia, Makriyalos), something that could resonate with eastern Macedonia being more affiliated with the communities to the North, where there was a tradition of manufacturing animal figurines in significant numbers during the earlier Neolithic (Nanoglou 2008a). However, even in these sites, there are substantially fewer animal figurines than human ones. The only exception to this general rule is the case of Dikili Tash, from where Marangou reports 56 anthropomorphic and 46 zoomorphic figurines (Marangou 1992: 257-258 and 260-261), although the detailed publication of the material is still pending and, judging from some figures (e.g. Marangou 1992: fig. 78e), she includes vessel parts in these numbers. All in all then, animal figurines are not that common in Neolithic northern Greece. Vessels with animal features The tabulation of representations belonging to the second category, vessels with animal features, is more difficult. First of all, there are problems of identification: some of the artifacts are not preserved sufficiently, in order to determine whether they were part of a vessel or not (especially when it comes to tips from the head or the legs). Moreover, there is no agreed way to categorise these examples: they frequently get grouped as figurines or vessels or 'altars', and because of their fragmentation, they are not always illustrated. In cases of big excavation projects, different people with different agendas study them. Nevertheless, this is a category with significant presence in the Neolithic of Greece.

Many examples are handles modelled as heads (Figs. 4 and 5) with no specific details, and indeed, some of them are ambiguous as to whether they depict animal or human heads (Nanoglou 2008b: 320). On the contrary, most of the surviving legs are more likely to be from four-legged vessels depicting animals. In addition, many of the vessels that are normally described as 'altars' stand on animal legs (Elster 1986, see also Sophronidou &amp; Tsirtsoni 2007, especially note 4). Even if we allow for a significant number of the handles to represent humans, the fact remains that vessels with animal features are frequent in Late Neolithic settlements. Given the small number of animal figurines and the much more numerous examples of vessels with animal features (Table III), it is fair to say that animal representations are particularly associated with pottery during the later Neolithic. Unfortunately, due to the above-mentioned indeterminacy of many heads (and possibly of some legs as well), it is not possible to tell the ratio of animal to human representations on vessels. That said, I think we can safely presume that the ratio of animal to human vessels is not proportionate to the ratio of animal to human figurines. In the former, animals are more abundant, whereas in the latter, humans predominate. House models The last category, house models with animal heads protruding from the walls, consists of fewer examples. Toufexis (2003: fig. 29.3) reports one house model from Thessaly (a surface find), which he reconstructs having an animal head on the roof of the model, and recently, two further examples have been found in Late Neolithic Promachon-Topolnica (Fig. 6, Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: Figs. 25-26). At the same site, recent excavations have found a probable clay bucranium and numerous actual bucrania deposited in successive layers of a deep pit Table III Animal Representations from Neolithic Settlements in Greece Animal figurines Vessels with animal Vessels with human/ features animal features8 EN-MN Achilleion 5 2 MN Servia 1 1 3 LN Servia 1 1 1 LN-FN Pefkakia 2 1 2 LN Makriyalos 14 30 &gt;120 LN Sitagroi 20 45 21 LN Dikili Tash &lt;46 &gt;7 18 Data according to Weifihaar (1989), Marangou (1992), Gimbutas (1986), Elster (1986), Nanoglou and Pappa (2009) and Pappa et al.

Finally, a plastered bucranium that probably hung from a wall has been found at the Late Neolithic site of Dikili Tash (Treuil and Darcque 1998). The above discussion of the three categories clearly shows that animal representations were mostly associated with vessels. A relevant point emerges, although not for the whole of northern Greece, if we take into consideration the use of different materials in the production of figures. In the earlier Neolithic and the early part of the later Neolithic (i.e. Early, Middle Neolithic and Late Neolithic I), stone was reserved almost exclusively for anthropomorphic pendants and human figurines were made almost exclusively from clay. On the contrary, in the later part of the later Neolithic (i.e. Late Neolithic II) in Thessaly and western Macedonia, clay and stone human figurines were produced in more or less equal numbers (Nanoglou 2008b for details). So, the use of different materials as a distinctive trait was brought from the wider field of human figures (distinguishing between figurines and vessels on one side and pendants on the other) to the sub-field of figurines (distinguishing between figurines). This change can be interpreted as a move towards a concern with the qualities of figurines and a relevant concern with the qualities of their users (Nanoglou 2008b). We could suggest that, by bringing their material to the front, human figurines were detached to a certain extent from other figures that continued to exclusively use clay. What is striking is that this change does not extend to animal representations. There are but a few animal figures made of stone during the whole Neolithic, and these are distinctive cases (see below). Furthermore, in the case of the Fig. 7 Promachon-Topolnica, Pit 4. Different layers with deposited bucrania and various artifacts. After Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. (2007): Fig. 12. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="13">196 Nanoglou use of actual bucrania, the plastering of the example from Dikili Tash (Treuil and Darcque 1998) and the probable clay model from Promachon-Topolnica (Koukouli- Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: 55) reinforce a sense of exclusiveness in the use of clay, although, in this case (i.e. eastern Macedonia), this exclusiveness seems to extend to the representation of humans as well. The connotations of animal figures then would have certainly been tied with the use of clay, and, in most cases, specifically with the use of pottery. Animal imagery and clay vessels would have been bundled together to constitute a specific articulation of the world, one in which the ontology of the animals represented would have been contingent on the use of these artifacts, perhaps particularly their capacity to carry substances; contingent on the specificities of every encounter that would have entailed the use of a vessel with animal features or the use of a bucranium or a house model with bucrania. In this vein, the discourse on the ontology of the animals would have been conditioned by the scenes of engagement with these particular artifacts and not with floating images that genetically depicted animals. Scenes of Engagement Going over the various points that indicate the use of representations as objects in the Neolithic of northern Greece is no easy task. Their association with pottery and, therefore, the rendering of animals as containers could provide an initial ground for thinking the specific connotations that the use of animal imagery would generate. Moreover, certain traits that come out from an examination of the artifacts themselves are reviewed below, in order to glean any indication as to their use. Most importantly, though, people would have engaged with these artifacts in the context of their production, use and eventual deposition, and although I should stress that we have very limited knowledge of such contexts, I turn to a few available cases below, in an effort to highlight the particularities of the invocation of animals in the various fields of social life in the Neolithic of northern Greece. Regarding animal figurines, not much is known. They are a few, and they are not concentrated in any particular contexts. An insight on their use can be gained from another trait: the presence of a hole on some of them (Fig. 2). This feature could suggest that they were hanging from somewhere or that something was hanging from them. This issue should remain purely hypothetical for the moment, but we could say that this is a feature that arguably made these figures part of a bigger assemblage, as any binding material would have tied them to something else. Turning to vessels with animal features, Marangou and Stern (2009) have recently published the results of some chemical studies on four Late Neolithic zoomorphic vessels, which were not wholly conclusive. Not all four of the specimens carried the same substances, and the main ones are interpreted as 'fossil fuel', 'cedar oil' and 'fat/oil', based on which the authors suggest that the vessels were used in relation to fire, either as lamps or braziers (Marangou and Stern 2009). Yet, as they admit, the 'fossil fuel' could have derived from the whereabouts of the vessels (near hearths or in destruction layers), 'cedar oil' could indeed be resin or tar (something attested for other types of vessels as well, see Urem-Kotsou et al. 2002) and fat could reasonably derive from food. Accordingly, their results do not seem to provide enough ground ^ Springer</page><page sequence="14">Animal Bodies and Ontological Discourse in the Greek Neolithic 197 to distinguish these vessels from the 'plain' pottery (see also Urem-Kotsou and Kotsakis 2007). Their context of deposition is not especially informative, other than being related to 'domestic' areas (Marangou 2004: 297-298). On the contrary, the excavation of Late Neolithic Makriyalos (Pappa 2008) provides a significant context of deposition of vessels with animal features. Most of the vessels dating to the first phase of the settlement (Makriyalos I, Late Neolithic I) were found in two large pits (pits 212 and 214), one of them towards the hypothetical centre of the settlement and the other next to the two ditches that encircle the settlement. Both of them are associated with exceptional cases of collective consumption of animals, mostly cattle (measuring carcasses by hundreds, Halstead and Collins 1996; Urem-Kotsou and Kotsakis 2007). Pit 212 measured 30 m in diameter, ranged from 0.3 to 1.4 m in depth and was filled with a large number of animal bones, pottery and other finds (Pappa et al. 2004; Halstead 2004). Pappa et al. (2004: 36) report on finding more than 120 handles in the form of animal heads in the deposits of the pit (Fig. 5), and, despite problems of identification (see above), there can be no doubt that the process of deposition of all these artifacts would have constituted a scene where people would have engaged with the representations of animals under specific conditions. The context of deposition of actual bucrania at the site of Promachon-Topolnica is, in certain aspects, comparable to that of Makriyalos. A large and very deep pit (pit 4, with an estimated diameter of 24 m and depth of 7 m), dated to the Late Neolithic I, was filled with successive layers full of artifacts and organic materials, among which numerous bucrania were found (Fig. 7, Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 2007). The process of accumulation of all these finds is not entirely comprehensible, but it seems that there were successive wooden floors within the pit (Koukouli- Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: 55). The excavators suggest that the deposition of the finds resulted from the collapse of each floor (Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: 55), but at present, it is equally plausible that the accumulation of all this material was part of a process of cleaning other areas and a subsequent deposition of the material into the pit. Whether the whole assemblage came from the collapsing of floors that held all this material or it turns out to have come from the clearance of 'domestic' contexts, the contemporary case of the plastered bucranium found at the nearby Late Neolithic Dikili Tash (Treuil and Darcque 1998), the possible clay bucranium found in Promachon-Topolnica (Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: 55) and the house models with protruding bucrania found at Promachon-Topolnica (Fig. 6, Koukouli- Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: Figs. 25-26, one of them found in pit 4 and the other just outside of it, ibid.: p. 59-60) are all indicative of a relation between certain buildings and the use of bucrania as wall 'decoration' (see also Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 1996: 750 on the occurrence of 'human-like' clay reliefs at Promachon-Topolnica). This practice, which finds synchronous parallels in northern areas of the Balkans (Chapman 1981: 73; Koukouli-Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: 63), can indeed mark this region as different from the western part of northern Greece, where such finds are not that common (apart from the above mentioned house model with a bucranium published by Toufexis 2003: Fig. 29.3). Because, in Promachon-Topolnica, pit 4 was the last context of use for the bucrania, but not necessarily their only one, we cannot say whether there were specific buildings 'decorated' with them. Furthermore, available data cannot inform us on the longevity of their use. Similar finds from the 4y Springer</page><page sequence="15">198 Nanoglou Balkans are not informative either, due to the lack of contextual information, but in the much earlier site of Catalhoyiik (7400-6000 bc, Hodder 2006), animal reliefs and installations were usually left in the buildings until their abandonment (Russell and Meece 2005: 228-229). The find of Dikili Tash suggests that there is a strong possibility that the same was happening in northern Greece, but this is only based on a single find. In any case, the use and invocation of just the head of the animal would have evoked certain connotations regarding the animals and their utilisation in the social life of the inhabitants. Apart from the occurrence of vessels with animal features in settlement assemblages, there are cases of such vessels used in burials, particularly an example of a zoomorphic vessel used as a cremation urn in the Late Neolithic I cemetery of Platia Magoula Zarkou (Gallis 1982). Notably, the example from Servia that Marangou and Stern (2009) refer to is not dated any more to the Neolithic (Musgrave 2000), but that does not change the fact that such vessels, and animal imagery in general, were not confined to settlements. As already said, animal representations continued to employ clay as the only material even after stone had entered the scene as a major substance in the representations of humans in certain Late Neolithic II contexts. Numerous handles in the form of animal heads have been found in Makriyalos II (similar to those in Fig. 5, Nanoglou and Pappa 2009), and enough are known from the corresponding phases at Sitagroi (Gimbutas 1986). Some handles known from Dimini (Tsountas 1908: Table 23) seem to depict human rather than animal heads (see also Skafida 1992, who characterises them as figurines). Although clay was definitely not reserved exclusively for animal representations, animal representations were only made of clay. This is significant not only for the regions where stone was used for human figures, but also for the regions where clay seems to have been the only material for human figures too. In the former case, human and animal figures were effectively separated from each other, as the focus on human figures shifted to their material (Nanoglou 2008b and above). In the latter case, the continuing use of an exclusive material (clay) suggests that there was an enduring principle that deemed this material the only adequate one for this purpose. Clay arguably might not have the same connotations and it does not seem to have been invoked in the same way in the two regions, but it was nevertheless a significant part of what these representations were about. Based on these cases, although not many and not yet wholly published, we cannot show any contexts for which vessels with animal features were specifically reserved, and the same applies to animal figurines. It is certainly the case that whatever patterns we can observe crosscut the distinction between tells and extended settlements: there are no patterns distinctive of a particular type of settlement. All in all, animal depictions were tightly associated with pottery, but for the moment, vessels with animal features do not seem to constitute a separate class of artifacts. In certain contexts, where these vessels are in excess, as in pits 212 and 214 in Makriyalos I, so are pottery and other artifacts (Pappa 2008). Certainly, there are indications that the cups with handles in the form of animal heads in pit 212 in Makriyalos were made expediently, as they were made with an apparent lack of standardisation in either their specific raw material (clay ware) or their particular form (Pappa et al. 2004; Urem-Kotsou and Kotsakis 2007). However, this was not 4y Springer</page><page sequence="16">Animal Bodies and Ontological Discourse in the Greek Neolithic 1 99 the only context where they were found, and although, admittedly, they could be easily associated with the consumption of meat, both on grounds of these contexts and their representing animals, this consumption need not be restricted to such grandiose occasions as the one reconstructed for pit 212. 1 mean that their use as part of a scene involving the consumption of meat could have been of much lesser magnitude than the one in pit 212 and of a much more frequent pace. In any case, as in pit 4 at Promachon-Topolnica, these contexts were certainly their last but not necessarily their only context of use. On the other hand, the use of actual bucrania, plastered bucrania or clay models of bucrania on walls, as in Promachon-Topolnica and Dikili Tash, point to a different interpretation. This is a more specific type of animal and, perhaps more importantly, a specific part of the animal: its head. In Dikili Tash, the bucranium was found within the building (Treuil and Darcque 1998: 2), whereas the house models from Promachon-Topolnica show the bucrania on the outside walls (Fig. 6, Koukouli- Chrysanthaki et al. 2007: Figs. 25-26). Furthermore, the house model from Thessaly shows the head of the animal on the roof (Toufexis 2003: Fig. 29.3). It is difficult to say if this means anything in particular, but the association of bovine heads with buildings certainly re-articulates these elements forcefully into a new discourse on the animal body and the built environment. Discussion: Representing and Constituting Species Following current approaches, all these cases would have to be fitted in the description of conditions under which people would have reaffirmed the importance of their mode of subsistence by symbolically stressing the animals they looked after (e.g. Toufexis 2003: 268). Thus, their economic dependence on sheep, goats, cattle and pigs would have guided the rendering of these species in clay and the use of these images in various contexts. All these images would have informed the lives of their users from an economic point of view, namely as exploitable matter. Underlining such an approach, most studies of animal representations attempt to classify images into 'domesticates' or 'wild', which is the very classification followed in the study of fauna, so again, imagery mirrors economy. Yet, in Neolithic northern Greece at least, images of 'wild' animals are non-existent. Toufexis refers to 'snakes', an identification which cannot stand under scrutinised study (Toufexis 2003: 264), while the single examples of a boar and a bear (ibid.) lack details, and I suggest that their identification is rather ambiguous, especially in the case of the boar, which could be also identified as a pig, if anything. 'Birds' are also ambiguous identifications, and most of the examples could easily be identified as generic animal heads protruding from vessels, a feature that explains their long necks. So, the only 'wild' animals depicted are frogs, to which I will return below. On the whole, there is very little evidence for the depiction of 'non-domesticates'. Perhaps it is equally significant that, during the early Neolithic, at least in Thessaly, the field of representations is overtly anthropocentric (Nanoglou 2008a). Thus, in the time when domestication as a concept might seem to have been highly relevant, representations do not seem to have tackled the issue. This is not very surprising, in view of the persistent discrepancy between represented animals and animal remains, whenever a S Springer</page><page sequence="17">200 Nanoglou comparison has been made (Russell and Meece 2005: 223, with references). It seems that, as in all the other cases, representations in Neolithic Greece were 'drawing on distinct symbolic repertoires' (Russell and Meece 2005: 223). As to the actual 'domesticates', although some figures from Thessaly show certain details, like horns or nozzles (see, e.g. Toufexis 2003: Figs. 29.12-29.13), most of them are generic renderings of quadruped animals, and I would suggest that perhaps there was no effort to pin down specific types of animals, at least types corresponding to our categorizations (for similar observations on the £atalhoyuk material, see Meskell 2008: 374; see also further below). The only definite representations of non-quadrupeds are the stone figures of frogs from Early Neolithic Nea Nikomedeia (one of which is a pendant, Rodden 1964) and another possible one from Chara 1 [Toufexis 2003: Fig. 29.16 (there is a mistake in the figure caption)]. In view of the significance of different materials in the manufacture of figures (Nanoglou 2008b and above), I suggest that both the material of these figures (stone rather than clay) and their particular form (non-quadrupeds) are evocative of their different character. They most probably constituted a different class of objects and a different class of animals, something other than quadrupeds. In all these contexts, the represented animals would have informed and shaped the experience of people drawing on specific points of reference. The animal ontology would have been constituted in these scenes and the criteria for categorising animals would have been laid in relation to these practices. In the cases of animals invoked along with pottery, their conceptualization would have been 'contaminated' by the use of the pots. Animals would have been thought, through pottery, perhaps as capable of carrying substances. The concomitant use of vessels with human features (Pileidou 2006), even in the same contexts, would speak against the exclusive association of containers with animals. However, articulating animals and pottery together would have probably enabled or even compelled the emergence of a particular species, one for which categories like 'domesticate' or not might have been irrelevant. The issue is that handling these artifacts would have provided the possibility to address an animal as capable of carrying or not. The animal would not have been tied to its 'economic' value; rather, it would have emerged as an animal container of a substance pertinent to the occasion. The association of the animals with the vessels would have conditioned the way animals could have been and were present in the world of these people. Representing these animals was not just an act of depicting or exteriorizing an innate ontology or reaffirming a deeper structure but, most importantly, a way to come to terms with a world that needed to be understood in order to be inhabited in a viable manner. These representations produced a context whereby certain animals were made intelligible as containers, as carrying something (be that food or even a cremated body). So, the ontological status of the animals which were invoked in the contexts of use of these vessels might have nothing to do with their being cattle, sheep or goats. The defining moment for this species, the one needed and invoked in these contexts, was its ability to contain a substance. It is likely that the substance in question would have been appropriate only if carried by these containers. As for the relevance of the other representations, the production of vessels with human features perhaps means that these animals were understood to share certain qualities with humans. On the other hand, the small amount of animal ^ Springer</page><page sequence="18">Animal Bodies and Ontological Discourse in the Greek Neolithic 201 figurines as opposed to human ones might mean these qualities were irrelevant to the practices for which figurines were used. In that aspect, these animals were different from people. In a different context, one produced by the dissemination of a practice like fixing bucrania on a wall or depositing them along with other things in a large pit, yet a different species would have been constituted. The necessary condition for the constitution of this species, to our eyes more specific than the quadruped container mentioned above, seems to be just the head and not the whole body of the animal. This is a representation that articulates a part of the animal bundling bones and clay in one entity. Whether made of clay on a skull (Dikili Tash), made of just clay or just a skull (Promachon-Topolnica), this entity brought together and assembled a new 'hybrid' in Latour's terminology (Latour 2005; see also Meskell 2008). It is important that this new species was invoked always in relation to buildings. Maybe the clay articulated in it was not further associated with pottery as in the previous case, but with wall material, the coating of walls, perhaps even seen as a kind of skin for both the animal and the buildings. Again, the site of Catalhoyiik is informative, although of much earlier date. There too, animal parts mounted on the walls were plastered and re-plastered like the walls (Last 2005: 202), refreshing the bond between the building and the animal head. Catalhoyiik offers much more information than all of the Greek sites mentioned here put together, and so, not much can be made regarding associations with particular walls or with other artifacts in the cases explored here. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the issue is that bucrania had a situated material presence that cited other presences (other animals, other buildings, other clay artifacts, other skins, etc.) and, in that, made all of them intelligible in specific ways. The materialisation of these 'assemblages' and its reiteration over time and space would have ultimately fixed their form, and it would have constituted new entities. I have tried to show that representations always have a very specific material presence, which conditions their effect on people and other beings. Any attempt to use them would have to involve an understanding of their particular position within the world, which entailed an understanding of what was represented and what was not represented, but especially of the way everything was represented, i.e. the way everything was re-articulated into a new materiality, be that a small figurine or a big vessel. This understanding was not just an informed view of the world, but the constitution and the negotiation of an ontological system for animals, humans and any other entities. In the end, it was the production of a new world. Acknowledgements I am grateful to Lynn Meskell, Cathy Cameron, Jim Skibo and the two anonymous reviewers for their comments.
