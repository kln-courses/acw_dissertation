BATES, Editor 220, St. Mark's Square, Philadelphia, Pa. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Evolution of Quaternary Art.-In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 378-411 (13 figs.), Abbe HENRI BREUIL gives a critical account of the dis- coveries, investigations, and theories of the late IEdouard Piette and traces the development of quaternary art. Sculpture in the round preceded reliefs and linear drawing in general, yet the earliest drawings are hardly less early than the earliest sculptures in the round. The Cult of the Sun in Prehistoric Times.--In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 305-357 (31 figs.), and XIV, 1909, pp. 94-123 (16 figs.), J. DECHELETTE discusses the cult of the sun in prehistoric times. Starting with the premise that mere decoration is not the purpose of the earliest art, he passes in review prehistoric monuments of different classes from places as widely separated as Egypt and the Scandinavian peninsula. The sun's disk drawn by a horse is found in the North, also at Syra, and, in degenerate form, on whorls from Troy. The "swastika," curved at first and later angular, takes the place of the disk. The triskelion is also a solar symbol. The boat of the sun led by a dolphin appears on some flat clay vessels from Syra (1500 B.c. at latest). The boat with swans' heads at bow and stern is also the sun's boat. This degenerates into a mere ornamental pattern as time goes on. Evidently it ceased to be understood, at least in some places. In Mycenaean and "Dipylon " art the horse, the swan, the disk, and the "swastika" have solar significance. The amphora from Pitane, some Cretan ossuaries, and various other monuments are interpreted in this sense. As anthropomorphism developed, the place of the sun's disk in a boat was 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books are conducted by Professor BATES, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Professor C.

The gorgon has solar connections and the ser- pents of the aegis may be misunderstood swans' necks. The god with a wheel in Gaul is, though identified with Jupiter, the sun-god. Even in modern village festivals in France, the wheel and the boat survive from the prehistoric sun-worship. The Art of Petra.- In Memnon, III, 1909, pp. 49-76 (7 figs.), J. THOMX- QUERUM reports the results of a recent expedition of the German Archaeo- logical Institute to the ruins of Petra under the leadership of the Director, Professor Dalman. All of the remains have been described before, but the photographs are new, and a number of them are of quite unfamiliar objects. Casian Researches. - In Mlemnon, III, 1909, pp. 1-48, A. WIRTH gathers the evidence which indicates that the primitive race, which he calls the Casian, or Caucasian, from the fact that its modern representatives are settled in the Caucasus Mountains, once spread over southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa prior to the settlement of either Semites or Indo-Europeans in these lands. This is proved by the linguistic affinity of Caucasian, Basque, and Berber; by the traditions of the migration of races; by the physical characteristics of the non-Aryan races of the Medi- terranean; by archaeological evidence of the similarity of houses, dress, ornaments, burial, and religious rites; and by the study of primitive geo- graphical names in all lands bordering upon the Mediterranean. Names of the Caucasian type are found in Asia Minor, Asia, Eastern Balkans, Greek Archipelago, Western Balkans, Epirus, Greece, the Alps, Germany, Aqui- tania, Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Elami, Syria, and among the Slavonians. This proves the existence of a primitive non-Semitic and non-Aryan race, which must be discriminated as one of the leading races of mankind, and which is not to be identified with Mongol, Hamitic, or any of the other main branches of the human race. For this race the name Casian is preferable to Hittite, Euro-African, or Mediterranean, because Kas was the name by which these peoples designated themselves. Caucasian, which is derived from Kas, is less desirable, because in current usage the Caucasian, or white race, includes Aryan and Semites. Two New Sabaean Inscriptions.-- In Or. Lit. XII, cols. 337-339 (pl.), M. HARTMAN publishes two brief Sabaean inscriptions discovered by H. Burchardt. One of them contains a new clan name, Nadran (?). The other belongs to the same class as the Ta'lab inscriptions. Southeastern Elements in the Prehistoric Civilization of Servia.- In B.S.A. XIV (session 1907-08), pp. 319-342 (14 figs.), MILOJE M. VAS- SITS discusses the vases, pottery, and other prehistoric remains found in Servia, especially at Vinia, establishes their connection with the Prehellenic civilization of the Aegean regions, and concludes that the prehistoric settle- menits of Servia " were formed under the continuous influence of a southeast- ern civilization. This disposes of the 'northerly' influence in the Aegean, and of the other theory of a parallel development of individual branches of one and the same race." His conclusions are disputed by M. S. THOMPSON and A. J. B. WACE (Cl. R. XXIII, 1909, pp. 209-212), who argue that con- nection with Thessaly or Troy is no proof of Aegean influence in Servia; that Servian pottery is very different from Cretan; that Thessalian culture is non-Aegean, and it is doubtful if there is dependence between it and Servian culture.</page><page sequence="3">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 207 Scandinavian Archaeology.- In Fornvdinnen, III, 1908, pp. 1-13 (27 figs.), T.

Archaeology in Croatia.- In the ,Vjesnik of the Croatian Archaeological Society at Zagreb (Agram), X, 1908-09 (Zagreb, 1909, C. Albrecht, 260 pp.; in the Croatian language), the following articles are of interest to archaeolo- gists: pp. 120-134 (21 figs.), V. HOFF'ILLER describes the discoveries, clhiefly bronzes and pottery, made in the ancient cemetery at Velika Gorica; pp. 149-222 (176 figs.), J. BRUNSMID continues his catalogue of the ancient sculptures in the Croatian National Museum at Agram, giving a brief account of each monument with its bibliography; pp. 231-237 (7 figs.), J. BRUNSMID continues his account of the prehistoric objects from Srijerm. Ancient Metrology in the Light of Modern Chinese Usage. - C. F. LEHMANN-HAUPT, in Z. Ethn. XLI, 1909, pp. 635-643 (fig.), describes a modern Chinese balance and compares the two scales on its beam with Babylonian, Egyptian, and Roman weights. He is convinced that much light may, in a similar way, be cast on many an ancient custom or imple- ment, for old things live on in China as nowhere else in the world. Museums, Libraries, and Cellars.-- In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 267- 270, S. REINACH strongly advocates tile desirability of separating the con- tents of museums and of libraries so that general exhibition rooms and easily accessible shelves shall contain only what is of general utility, the other material in the collections being removed from the public and placed where it can be consulted by specialists. The Greek Papyri and the New Testament.- In Bibl. World, XXXIV, 1909, pp. 151-158 (2 pls.), G. MILLIGAN gives an account of the papyri found in Egypt in recent years, describing the technical processes of their manufacture, giving the history of their discovery, and finally their importance for the student of the New Testament. Charles Perrault, Critic of Art.-- In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 203- 215, S.

XIV, 1910 view, the old quarries used by the Egyptians of the Stone Age and the implements found in them. Notes on Some Egyptian Antiquities.-- In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXI, 1909, p. 255 (pl.), W. L. NASH publishes notes on (1) a bronze axe-head, inscribed "Men Kheper Ra, beloved of Amen, when he stretched the cord in Zezer Amen Khut," referring to the foundation of a temple which may be either that which stood above the eleventh dynasty temple of Mentu- hetep, or that recently discovered at the entrance to the valley leading to the temple of Hatshepsut; (2) a small vase of green glazed faience in- scribed with hieroglyphs; (3) a steatopygous figure of doubtful date; a fusiform object of hard sandstone inscribed, Ra Nefer Ab - Psamthek II, resembling possibly the roll of papyrus held in the hand of the king at his coronation ceremony. The Carved Slates. - In S.Bibl. Arch. XXXI, 1909, pp.204-211 (2 pls.), F. LEGGE reviews the various interpretations suggested for the so-called "slate palettes," which he believes to have been votive shields (see S. Bibl. Arch. XXII, 1900, p. 135), and holds that the scenes shown on them are "scenes of war in which almost every animal there portrayed represents some tribe or clan engaged"; he then discusses Loret's theory as to the identity of the tribes represented under the guise of the attacking animals, and attempts further to identify various nomne-standards by means of these carved slates. Egyptian Jewelry in Berlin.- In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 269- 275 (10 figs.), Schafer gives a brief account of the Egyptian jewelry in the Berlin museum, describing particularly a pair of inlaid gold ear-rings dat- ing from the end of the second millennium B.C. A Portrait of Queen Tiyi in Brussels.-In Bulletin des mnuse'es royaux t Bruxelles, I, 1908, pp. 9-11 (2 figs.), J. CAPART publishes a portrait of Queen Tiyi now in Brussels and identifies it as part of the relief from Thebes published in Annales du Service des antiquites de l'Egypte, IV, 1903, pp. 177-178. The First Appearance of the Hittites in the Egyptian Inscriptions. - In Or. Lit. XII, 1909, cols. 427-429, W. M. MULLER discusses the fact that no express mention of the Hittites is found in Egyptian texts before the time of Thutmosis III. In the reign of this king, however, the orthography of the name of the Hittites is firmly established, which implies that the Egyptians must have been in relations with them as early as the period of the Hyksos. This was not far removed from the period in which the Hittites are known to have attacked Babylon. It is to be expected, accordingly, that mention of them may be found as far back as the twelfth Egyptian dynasty, but not earlier, as the form of orthography indicates. The present absence of allu- sion in early Egyptian texts is to be regarded as accidental. The Foreigners of Memphis. - In Rec. Past, VIII, 1909, pp. 131-136 (15 figs.), W. M. FLINDERS PETRIE discusses briefly some of the small terra- cotta heads of foreigners found in the foreign quarter at Memphis in 1908. He recognizes Sumerian, Semitic, Persian, Indian, Scythian, and Tibetan types. He also calls attention to the eighteenth dynasty tablets with figures of ears on them found at the temple of Ptah. The Egyptian Nomes. - In Abh. Sdichs. Ges. XXVII, 1909, pp. 860-898 (No. 25), G. STEINDORFF discusses the Egyptian nomnies and their politi-</page><page sequence="5">BABYLONIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 209 cal development. He gives the names of the nomes as they are recorded at different times. He finds no proof that they were ever independent little countries. The division of Egypt into two administrative parts, Upper and Lower Egypt, is discussed in its different forms. A division into three parts is unknown before the middle of the first century after Christ. The Earliest Marriage-Contracts. - In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXI, 1909, pp. 212-220, F. LL. GRIFFITI offers a new translation, with commentary and transcription, of the two papyri in the Louvre collection of the twenty- sixth dynasty which contain the two earliest known marriage-contracts, dating probably about 590 B.c. and 547 B.c. The Difficulties at Elephantine in the Year 411 B.C.--In Z. Assyr. XXIII, 1909, pp. 187-196, A. VAN HOONACKER discusses the Aramaic papyrus published by Euting and Sachau, in which the Jews of Elephan- tine complain that their temple of Yahu has been destroyed by the Egyp- tians; and endeavors to show that the ground of the Egyptian's opposition to this temple was that it was irregular, even from a Jewish point of view, and that consequently there is no conflict between this document and the Deu- teronomic demand for the centralization of worship. A Marble Head of a Libyan. - A marble head of a Libyan in the col- lection of F. W. voN BISSING is published by the owner in A th. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 29-32 (pl.). He dates it between 50 n.c. and 50 A.D. The Fish as a Symbol of the Soul. - In Arch. Rel. XII, 1909, pp. 574- 575 (fig.), W. SPIEGELBERG calls attention to an Egyptian sarcophagus of Hellenistic or Roman date upon which a fish appears above a mummy which is lying on a bier. The fish seems to be a symbol of the soul; and this sug- gests a possible origin for the Christian symbol. The Geography of Eastern Africa in its Connection with Egypt. - E. SCHIAPARELLI, in Rend. A cc. Lincei, XVIII, 1909, pp. 49-75, prefaces a dis- cussion of the topography of the regions east and south of Egypt, which are referred to very obscurely on Egyptian monuments, with a description of those regions as they are to-day. Among the causes of the vagueness of the monuments he emphasizes the fact that in ancient times as to-day the change in the nature of the country as one went south on the mountains or in the valley must have been very gradual, and the boundaries, ethnographically speaking, must have been very indistinct between the peoples with vary- ing admixture of negro and Caucasian blood. The negroes, he insists, having no fear of malaria have always been able to hold regions uninhabit- able by the whites. Among topographical references discussed are: "the regions of the south"; "the land of the negroes "; Tachonti; Chontihon- nofer; Cush, etc. These terms, the writer says, have in addition to a defi- nite, restricted meaning, in very many contexts a vaguer and more extensive use. BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA The Chronology of Berossus.- In Mitt. Vorderas. Ges. XIII, 1908, pp. 231-277, P. SCHNABEL investigates the chronological scheme of Berossus as a whole, and shows that he regards the entire duration of the world as 600 sars of years, or 2,160,000 years. This he divides into, first, seven periods of 240 millenniums each, the seven ages of creation; second, a period of 432,000 years for the kings before the flood; third, a period of 36,000 years for</page><page sequence="6">210 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 the kings after the flood; and, fourth, a period of 12,000 years for the times of the end. He next considers the fact that both Callisthenes and Berossus, deriving their information independently from Babylonian sources, place the year 2232 B.c. as the beginning of historical times in Babylonia. This date is to be identified with the beginning of the first dynasty of Babylon. The sum total of the kings in Berossus is 1501 years, and agrees with the sum total of the Babylonian List, if we allow for the overlapping of dynasty II and dynasty I. This shows that Berossus must have depended upon BabylQnian sources similar to the List of Kings, but the figures that he gives for the particular dynasties do not agree with the figures of the Babylonian List. This Schnabel seeks to explain by the hypothesis of a different reck- oning of dynasties and a transposition of some of the figures. Rim-Sin and Samsuiluna. - In Z. Assyr. XXIII, 1909, pp. 73-89, A. UNGNAD presents evidence to show that although Rim-Sin was defeated by Hammurabi, he was not overthrown by him, but retained his sovereignty over the region of Emutbal, and at the beginning of Samsuiluna's reign took advantage of the general confusion in Babylonia to conquer the city of Uruk. He cannot have remained long in possession of it, for in the eleventh year of his reign Samsuiluna rebuilt the wall of Uruk. It was, accordingly, in his tenth year that Samsuiluna captured Uruk and drove Rim-Sin out of Babylonia. A Contract from Hana. - In J. Asiat. XIII, 1909, pp. 149-156, F. THU- REAU-DANGIN publishes an additional tablet from the kingdom of Hana, from which three or four documents are already known. It contains a contract executed under a king who bears the Kassite name of Kashtiliashu, and relates to the sale of a tract of land situated in the territory of Tirqa, the capital city of Hana. Amalek in the Babylonian Inscriptions. - In Or. Lit. XII, 1909, cols. 241-245, H. GRIMME gathers evidence to prove that the familiar Babylonian geographical name Meluha is etymologically identical with the Old Testa- ment name Amalek. From this he concludes that Amalek was a Semitic people; and, by a comparison of Babylonian texts with the Old Testament, is able to give a fairly complete history of the region lying between the Egyptian delta, Northwestern Arabia, and the south of Judah, from about 2500 B.C. down to the destruction of the Amalekites by Saul. The Name Abraham in Babylonian. - In Exp. Times, XXI, 1909, pp. 88-90, S. LANGDON calls attention to errors which have been made with regard to the name of Abraham occurring in a certain contract-tablet in the Royal Museum at Berlin, catalogued as Vat. 1473, but gives several trans- lations of texts of other tablets also in the Berlin museum to prove that the name Abram was current in the days of Hammurabi in Babylonia. This he interprets as meaning "love the father." Aramaic Inscriptions from Babylon.- In Eph. Sem. Ep. III, 1909, pp. 12-19, M. LIDZBARSKI reprints the Aramnaic dockets of Babyvloian cuneiform tablets published by A. T. Clay in Old Testament and Semitic Studies in Memory of W . R. Harper, Vol. I, pp. 285-322, so far as these inscriptions have not been published already in Eph. Sem. Ep. II, pp. 203 ff. He also reports Clay's additions to earlier discussions of these inscriptions. The texts are interesting as showing that the old Sumerian name of the god En-lil was pronounced El-lil and was in use down to the latest times in</page><page sequence="7">BABYLONIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 211 Babylonia. They also contain a number of Jewish names compounded with Yahweh. The Babylonian God Tamfiz. - In Abh. Sdchs. Ges. XXVII, 1909, pp. 698-738 (No. 20), HEINRICH ZIMMERN puts together the information con- cerning the god Tamiiz derived from inscriptions. The name is Sumerian and meant originally "True Son of the Depths of the Water." Tamiiz was a god of vegetation, and his astral connections are of relatively late origin. His relations to other gods, his cult, and the myths relating to him are briefly discussed. A Hymn to Ishtar.- In Mitt. Vorderas. Ges. XII, 1908, pp. 206-230, A. SCHIOLLMEYER discusses the Hymn to Ishtar first published by Pinches in S. Bibl. Arch. XVII, and also several duplicates of parts of this hymn in Reisner's Hymns and Haupt's Akkadian and Sumerian Hymns. The hymn is given in full in transliteration and translation with a commentary. It is a Sumerian and Babylonian bilingual, and it contains in its first part a lament of the goddess over the destruction of her city and temple by a foreign enemy, perhaps the destruction of Erech by the Elamites; and in the second part a song of praise of herself uttered by the goddess. Babylonian Orientation. - In Z. Assyr. XXIII, 1909, pp. 1)6-208, M. JASTROW, Jr., discusses the order in which the Babylonians enumerated the points of the compass. Against the view of Kugler that they began with the north, he maintains that the evidence is insufficient, and that for astrological purposes the south was taken as the starting-point. Another method of orientation beginning with the east was usual in acts of worship. The Number Forty among the Semites.-- In Abh. Sdchs. Ges. XXVII (No. 4), 1909, pp. 91-138, W. H. ROSCHER discusses the sigiilifi- cance of the number forty among the Semites. In Sitzb. Sdchs. Ges. LXI, 1909, pp. 15-206, he examines the lore attached to this number by the Greeks and by other peoples. Anklets as a Sign of Nobility among the Semites. - In Or. Lit. XII, 1909, cols. 381-382, W. M. MiYLLER calls attention to a statement of the Elephantine papyrus that an offending Persian official was deprived of his anklets, and points out that on the old Egyptian monuments distin- guished Asiatics are often represented wearing heavy rings of gold or silver around the ankle, and that these were evidently regarded as badges of high office. The Relative Value of Gold and Silver in Babylonia. - In Or. Lit. XII, 1909, cols. 382-384, F. THIUREAU-DANGIN calls attention to a tablet of the time of Hammurabi which shows that in his period silver had ) the value of an equal weight of gold, and copper z- of an equal weight. These relations correspond to the old Babylonian sexagesimnal system, and it is probable, therefore, that they were already fixed by the Sumerians. M1easures of Capacity in Archaic Texts from Tello. - In J. Asiat. XIII, 1909, pp. 245-248, A. DE LA FUiE subjects the ancient mneasures of capacity from Tello to a reexamination and comes to the conclusion that his statements in J. Asiat. VI, 1905, need modification. The facts are, that the gur sag-gal was different from the gur lugal, or gur Agade; that the gur sag-gal contained 144 ga, and that the gur sag-gal and its subdivisions were represented in texts of the pre-Sargonic period by a double system of notation: the first, which was commonly employed, used a series of curved</page><page sequence="8">212 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 lines; the second employed cuneiform signs in addition to the curved symbols. Oriental Cylinders.- In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 297-304 (pl., repro- ducing eight cylinders), L. DELAPORTE describes nine Oriental cylinders in the collection of the late Albert Maignan. On three of them Eabani (part man and part bull) appears in conflict with a beast or with Gilgames. On the third of these are three scenes, in one of which a nude woman appears. This cylinder is Babylonian. On the fourth cylinder are a seated god and two standing persons, one of whom wears a horned tiara. Two cylinders exhibit a standing female deity before whom is a standing bearded person. Both cylinders, like No. 4, are inscribed. On the seventh cylinder are four standing figures, perhaps all deities. Before the chief divinity is the sym- bol of the moon-god Sin. This is also on Nos. 4, 5, and 6. On the eighth cylinder are two Syro-Cappadocian scenes: a seated deity before whom stands a nude female, and a standing deity opposite another standing per- son. The ninth cylinder, not published, is very badly executed. On it two rows of animals are represented. ibid. XIV, 1909, pp. 250-253 (pl.), L. DELAPORTE publishes a new seal of the scribe Ur-Enlil, son of Ka- i(g)-ab, of the period of the kings of Ur. It is in the collection of Mr. J. Bessonneau. Toward a god, seated to left, a divinity advances leading a carefully shaven person who holds his right hand before his face. In the field before the seated deity is the crescent surmounted by a disk in which is a star of four points between which are groups of undulating rays. Between the other persons is the lion-headed eagle. The support of the seated deity is a goat to whose head is attached a cord which passes over the god's shoulder and isheld by his left hand. Other examples of animals as supports are cited. Why this scribe possessed two seals is not known. Ashurbanipal and the Assyrian Civilization of his Times. - In Alt. Or. XI, pp. 1-44 (17 figs.), F. DELITZSCH gives a survey of the history of the period of Ashurbanipal and of the civilization of that period in the light of the most recent researches, particularly those that have lately been carried on by the German expedition at the city of Ashur. The sketch contains an account of Ashurbanipal's conquests and of the legends based upon them by Greek historians; of hunting, military organization, architec- ture, sculpture, furniture, trade, literature, and music. Valuable supple- ments contain extracts from Greek histoiians, and a chronological table of the Assyrian monarchs based upon the latest discoveries in the excavations of Ashur. Assyriological Literature. - In J. Asiat. XIII, 1909, pp. 179-224 and 359-418, C. FoSSEY gives an elaborate account of the progress of Assyrian science in its various branches during the years 1905-1906. SYRIA AND PALESTINE Phoenicians, Judaeo-Hellenes, and Berbers in the Basin of the Mediterranean. -In J. Asiat. XIII, 1909, pp. 225-234, M. SCHWAB dis- cusses two works recently published by N. Slouschz on the Hebraeo-Phoeni- cians and the Judaeo-Hellenes and Judaeo-Berbers, in which he maintains that as early as the eleventh century B.C. the Hebrews and Phoenicians con- stituted a homogeneous race, which spread through colonies to all parts of</page><page sequence="9">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 213 the Mediterranean; and that the descendants of these early settlers con- stitute the Jewish colonies that are now to be found in northern Africa and Europe. The peculiar traits of separateness from other races and of persistence of type, that are supposed to be characteristic of the Jews, really date back to the ancient period of the Hebraeo-Phoenician colonies. The Monuments at the Nahr el-Kelb. - In Alt. Or. X, 1909, Pt. 4, pp. 1-27 (4 figs.), H. WINCKLER investigates anew the antiquities situated at the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb, or Dog River, near Beirut. These consist of three monuments of Rameses II and one each of Tiglath-Pileser I, Ashurnasirpal, Shalmanezer II, Adad-nirari, Tiglath-Pileser III, Senna- cherib, Esarhaddon, and Nebuchadnezzar. There are also remains of the ancient road and of the Roman road that ran around the promontory. Ancient Palestinian Topography.--In J. Bibl. Lit. XXVIII, 1909, pp. 26-33, G. A. BARTON enumerates the places in Palestine which may be regarded as definitely identified with Biblical sites, and discusses other proposed identifications which seem to him uncertain. The Scene of Abraham's Sacrifice. - In Exp. Times, XXT, 1909, pp. 86-88, A. H. SAYCE claims that the temple-hill at Jerusalem was the scene of Abraham's sacrifice, that it had already been a sacred spot in neolithic times, that subsequently there arose here a high-place formed of mono- liths such as that discovered by Macalister at Gezer, and that here in the sacred grove Abraham found the ram. Before the age of David, the mono- liths had made way for a "temple," perhaps under Hittite influence. In the history of this temple-hill at Jerusalem, therefore, he finds a parallel to that of the rock-shrine which he discovered in Nubia near Dirr, where the same persistence of a cult can be traced. Studies in Galilee.- In his Studies in Galilee (Chicago, 1909, University of Chicago Press, xv, 154 pp.; 33 figs., 8vo, $1.12), Dr. G. W. G. MASTER- MAN discusses the topography of Galilee, taking up in turn its physical features, boundaries, and chief towns; its inland fisheries; Gennesaret, Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida; the ancient synagogues; and, finally, Galilee in the time of Christ. A Temple of Mithra in Galilee.-- In Or. Lit. XII, 1909, cols. 425-427, R. EISLER calls attention to a passage in the Sohar of Moses of Leon which shows that a sanctuary of Mithra must have existed in Galilee, and that the chief rites of the cult of Mithra were known to the Jewish Rabbis of the early Christian centuries. The Inscription of Zakir, King of Hamath. - In Eph. Sem. Ep. III, 1909, pp. 1-11, M. LIDZBARSKI reprints the Aramaic inscription on the stele of Zakir published by Pognon in Inscriptions se'mitiques, Paris, 1907-08, and summarizes the results of the discussions of this inscription that have gone on during the past year. The texrt is accompanied by a translation and commentary. In J. Bibl. Lit. XXVIII, 1909, pp. 57-70, J. A. MONTGOMERY publishes some additional notes and restorations. The Teima Stone. - In Bibl. World, XXXIII, 1909, pp. 424-425 (pl.), E. J. GOODSPEED gives an account of the history of the famous Teima Stone of the Louvre, together with a concise statement of its importance and sig- nificance as an early example of Aramaic epigraphy and as "affording an unusual glimpse of the religious life of ancient polytheistic Arabia, in the time of Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the scribe, and Geshen the Arabian."</page><page sequence="10">214 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 Aramaic and Phoenician Ostraka. - In Eph. Sern. Ep. III, 1909, pp. 19-29 (3 pls.), Mn. LIDZBARSKI publishes eight ostraka that are found in the library at Strassburg, and in the Antiquarium at Munich. They are of the same type as the recently published ostraka from Elephantine. Alasiotas. - In Memnon, III, 1909, pp. 90-92, G. H UissING discusses the bilingual text discovered by Ohnefalsch-Richter at Frangissa near Tamassus, in Cyprus, in which the Greek name A lasiolas is transcribed into Phoenician as Alahiotas. He explains this as due to a dialectic peculiarity of the Phoe- nician spoken in Cyprus, by which the letter h came to stand for the sound sh. The change is similar to that by which the Babylonian suffixes beginning with sh are represented in Hebrew and Phoenician by h. Alasiotas is cer- tainly the Alashia of the Tell-el-Amarna letters. He seeks further to show that Yatnan, the later Assyrian name for Cyprus, is a corruption of Alashia. The God "Lord of the House."- In Z. Assyr. XXIII, 1909, pp. 184- 186, T. NOLDEKE discusses the Nabatean inscriptions published by Torrey in J.A.O.S. XXIX, pp. 197 ft., in which, along with the goddess Al-'Uzza, a deity called the "Lord of the House" is mentioned. He refers to Siira 106 of the Quran, in which Muhammad speaks of the god of the Ka'ba at Mecca as "Lord of this house." It is possible, accordingly, that the deity worshipped at Petra was the Meccan divinity, Hubal. The Gezer Inscription. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLI, 1909, pp. 189-193, G. B. GRAY adds some notes to his original publication of the Gezer inscrip- tion (ibid. XLI, pp. 26-34) in reply to Father Vincent's discussion of it in R. Bibl. 1909, pp. 213-269. Ibid. pp. 194-195, M. LIDZBARSKI also refutes Father Vincent's reading of the much discussed character as nun and insists that it is vyaw. A further discussion of this inscription is contributed by K. MARTI, Z. Alttest. Wiss. XXIX, 1909, pp. 222-229 (pl.). The Old Hebrew Alphabet and the Gezer Tablet.-- In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLI, 1909, pp. 284-309, S. A. COOK investigates very fully the much discussed problem as to the date of the Gezer tablet and its place in Hebrew epigraphy, maintaining his previously expressed view that, from the paleo- graphical evidence as well as on archaeological grounds, it should be dated "somewhere about the exile." The Semitic Alphabet. - In Z. Morgenl. Ges. LXIII, 1909, pp. 189- 198, F. PRAETORIUS discusses the relation of the Canaanite and the South Semitic forms of the alphabet. We do not know the date of the South Ara- bian inscriptions, but they are certainly not later than 700 B.c., which is 150 years after the Mesha inscription. Both forms of writing show a high degree of development when we first meet them, so that these scripts must have been in use for a longer time, both in Canaan and in Arabia, than we have literary evidence of their existence. It is impossible to derive the South Semitic alphabet from that of the Mesha inscription, and equally im- possible to derive the alphabet of Mesha from the South Arabian. Both must be regarded as descendants of a common original. This is to be sought in a primitive form of the Cypriote syllabary. The varied forms of s, for instance, in South Arabian and in Canaanite, can be explained most readily as derived from the Cypriote syllables si and sa. Similarly, the Canaanite m is derived from Cypriote me and South Semitic m from Cypriote mi. The Cult of Baal and Astarte in England. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLI,</page><page sequence="11">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 215 1909, pp. 280-284, S. A. COOK restates the evidence for the Baal and Astarte worship in England and presents the problems connected therewith. The Date of Deuteronomy.--In Exp. Times, XXI, 1909, pp. 45-46, A. H. SAYCE reviews a paper recently read before the French Academy by Professor Naville, entitled "Une Interpritation Bgyptienne d'un Texte biblique: la Dicouverte de la Loi sous le roi Josias." The paper gives the results of an exhaustive examination of the Egyptian evidence for the belief that the Jewish Book of the Law, usually identified with Deuteronomy, discovered in the Temple at Jerusalem during the reign of Josiah, was placed in the walls of that temple when it was built by Solomon. It is further explained that the book was intended to be so placed in the founda- tions of the temple, and was really" The Books of the Law in a single Book," written for that purpose. Professor Sayce also claims that Proverbs 25:1 gives support to the conclusions of the paper. Notes on New Discoveries. - In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLI, 1909, pp. 266- 275, C. R. CONDER publishes notes on certain points in Bible history on which light has been thrown by the recent explorations in Western Asia. A Phoenician Drachm with the Name of Jehovah.- In Num. Chron. 1909, pp. 121-131 (3 ill.), A. W. IHANDS describes a much discussed, unique Phoenician drachm in the British Museum, which has on the obverse a bearded, helmeted head, and on the reverse a bearded divinity holding an eagle and seated in a car with a winged wheel. On his right is a human head, above which are the Phoenician forms of the Hebrew letters yod, he, vaw. The coin was apparently struck at Sidon or Gaza between 405 and 380 n.c., and marks an attempt to identify the chief Hebrew deity with the Greek Zeus. Alexandrine Coinage of Phoenicia. - In Nomisma, IV, 1909, pp. 1-15, G. F. HILL establishes the character and chronological sequence of the "Al- exanders" from the mints of Arados (with its subsidiary mints, Karne and Marathos), Sidon, Ake-Ptolemais, and Tyre. Greek Inscriptions in Syria.- In Parts II and III, Section B, Division III, of the Publications of the Princeton University Archaeological Expedition to Syria in 1904-1905 (76 pp.; map; 48 figs. Leyden, 1909, E. J. Brill), W. K. PRENTICE publishes 164 Greek inscriptions from Northern Syria. Most of them are short and of a semi-religious character. In Me'l. Fac. Or. III, 1909, pp. 713-752, L. JALABERT discusses some of the readings and restorations in Part I, as well as in Part III of the Publications of an Ameri- can Archaeological Expedition to Syria in 1899-1900. Ancient Architecture in Syria.--In Parts II and III, Section B, Division II, of the Publications of the Princeton University Archaeological Expedition to Syria in 1904-1905 (101 pp.; 3 maps; 11 pls.; 127 figs. Ley- den, 1909, E. J. Brill), H. C. BUTLER describes the architectural remains at thirty different sites in Northern Syria. Part II deals with new material, while Part III is largely an amplification of de Vogiid's work in the same regions. Important churches, houses, tombs, and other buildings are dis- cussed in detail. The more important sites visited were I1-Anderin, Kerra- tin, Ma'crats, and SerdjillH.</page><page sequence="12">216 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 ASIA MINOR Notes on Antiquities in Asia Minor. - In Exp. Times, XXI, 1909, pp. 64-66, Sir W. M. RAMSAY contributes two notes on antiquities in Asia Minor. In the first he makes certain corrections, in the light of the critical text of the Hieronymian Martyrology, published by Monsignor Duchesne, in the list of the Syriac Martyrology relating to Gaianus, martyr at Ancyra in Galatia; the entry probably refers to a martyrdom on a large scale on the day of a festival celebrated either August 31 or September 4, under Domi- tian, Trajan, or Hadrian at Ancyra. In the second note, on the "Armed Priestesses in the Hittite Religion," he cites a sculptured figure on one of the door-posts of the east gate of Boghaz Keui, which is likened to "an Amazon armed," as confirming his interpretation of the similar figures in the famous rock-sanctuary near Boghaz Keui, as armed priestesses. Three Small Bronzes from Asia Minor.- Three small bronze figures are published by H. S. COWPER in J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 192-197 (4 figs.). The first, about 4 inches high, from Samos, apparently represents the earliest efforts of bronze casting in that cradle of the art, and may be contemporary with Rhoecus, Theodorus, and Telecles, who are said to have invented it in the sixth century B.c. with the help of a visit to Egypt. In type the bronze stands between the plank-like figure of the Nicandra statue at Athens and the post-like Samian statue of Hera, in the Louvre. Three archaic bronzes which belong in the same group with this one have been found at Sesso and Vulci, Italy, and at Melos. The hair of the Samrian figure suggests Egyptian influence. It has no lock falling in front of the shoulders. A bronze blade about 15 inches long, belonging to a short thrusting sword, is said to have been found with it. A bronze figure of Artemis of the huntress type with knotted hair, short garment, boots and a bow, comes from Ephesus. It is nearly 6 inches high. Several figures in Reinach's Re'pertoire may be compared. A grotesque little figure from Mylasa in Caria, less than 3 inches high, represents a trumpeter blowing his trumpet with all his might. The head, besides being caricatured in the details, is immensely large in proportion to the body, and the body is much too large for the legs. The Discoveries at Boghaz Keui.--In Bibl. World, XXXIII, 1909, pp. 367-381, A. H. SAYCE discusses the results of the discoveries made by Winckler and others in 1906 and 1907 at Boghaz Keui in Cappadocia, which, he maintains, have confirmed his own theory propounded some thirty years ago with regard to the power of the Hittite empire in the latter part of the second millennium B.c. He gives a summary of this new chapter which has been added to Oriental history, and a statement of our present knowledge of the Hittites, their power and influence, as well as their language. He also states that the cuneiform tablets recently discov- ered at Boghaz Keui confirm him in his belief that he holds the key to the decipherment of the Hittite hieroglyphic inscriptions. A popular article on Boghaz Keui (Keouy) is contributed by ISABEL F. DODD to the National Geographic Magazine, XXI, 1910, pp. 111-124 (11 figs.). Architectural Fragments from Ephesus. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 172-178 (5 figs.), W. AMELUNG identifies four small architectural fragments of marble, found in the market-place at Ephesus and published</page><page sequence="13">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 217 by Benndorf (Ibid. V, p. 180, Fig. 51), as the small building above the head of statues of the Ephesian Artemis. A fragment in the Villa Albani and a statuette of the goddess in the Capitoline Museum are the evidence for the identification. The building had four facades, but its purpose is not clear. A Relief from Ephesus. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 178-182 (5 figs.), W. AMELUNG compares the small female figure in relief from the monument of Marcus Aurelius at Ephesus with the Athena in the Louvre believed by Reisch and Sauer to be a copy of the cult statue of the HIephaes- teum at Athens, and with an Artemis in Liverpool. He also points out the resemblance of the colossal head of Athena in the British Museum. All of these works go back to originals of the latter part of the fifth cenltury. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus.--A. E. HENDERSON'S article on the temple of Artemis at Ephesus published in the Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, December 5, 1908, is reprinted in part in Rec. Past, VIII, 1909, pp. 195-206 (6 figs.). The greater part of the paper is devoted to the temple of the time of Croesus. The So-called Basilica at Pergamon.- The theory of Michaelis that the word P3aLXLK~j was used by the Greeks to designate closed buildings and also open stoas is combated by G. LEROUX, B.C.H. XXXIII, 1909, pp. 238- 244. There is no evidence for the existence of a "basilica" at Pergamon except the tiles with the inscription flpao'XLK (KcpapJL). This, however, means tile from the royal factory. The mention of a Troa flaLAuLKy at Thera in an inscription of the second century A.D. is simply a translation of the Roman term. The foundations uncovered east of the Theseumrn at Athens and at first thought to belong to a long stoa, the Stoa Basileios, turned out to be those of a small building, possibly a temple. The Mercenaries and Military Colonies of Pergamon. - In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 363-377, A. J. REINACH continues (see A.J.A. XIII, 1909, pp. 200 and 489) his study of the mercenaries and military colonies of Pergamon, treating in this number of the Aetolians and Achaeans and the Cretans. Ibid. XIV, 1909, pp. 55-70 (fig.), he treats of the Trallians from Thrace. An Ionian Law Earlier than Solon. - Under the title 'Nordionische Steine,' U. v. WILAMOWITZ-MOELLENDORF has published in Abh. Berl. Akad. 1909, a series of interesting inscriptions discovered by Paul Jacobsthal at Chios and Erythrae. The most important one, though sadly mutilated, was found at Tholopotami, near the city of Chios. The characters, very archaic and engraved boustrophedon, are not later than 600 B.c. There was at that time, we know, a popular assembly at Chios in which the tribes (the number of which is unknown) were represented, as in the constitution of Cleisthenes at Athens, and this assembly dispensed justice. The assembly met once a month to consider public affairs, i.e. take part in administration. The tendencies are the same as those seen later at Athens. Evidently the foundations of Greek social organization, as of poetry and philosophy, were laid in Ionia. (Summarized by S. R., R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 279-280.) Attis-cult in Cyzicus.- The numismatic witness to the prevalence and character of the worship of Attis in Cyzicus is set forth by IH. voN FRITZE in Nomisma, IV, 1909, pp. 33-42 (pl.).

XIV, 1910 61 pp.; map), A. GRUHN argues that the Troy of Homer cannot be identified with the ruins at Hissarlik, but must rather be sought at Dudin. Antiquities at Brusa.- A catalogue of the Greek, Roman, and Byzan- tine antiquities in the museum at Brusa is published by G. MENDEL, B.C.H. XXXIII, 1909, pp. 245-435 (3 pls.; 87 figs.). GREECE SCULPTURE Archaic Marbles in the Acropolis Museum. - In his Archaische 2Mlarmor-Skulpturen im Akropolis-Museurm zu Athen (Vienna, 1909, A. Holder. 87 pp.; 77 figs.) H. SCHRADER presents the more important results of his study of the archaic marble fragments in the Acropolis Museum at Athens. Many new pieces have been added to familiar figures, sometimes with surprising results. The Gorgon's head (No. 701) belonged to a running, winged figure which served as the middle acroterion of the old temple of Athena. The lower part of No. 682, one of the standing female figures, has been added, almost completing the statue except for the arms. The lower part of No. 669 has also been restored to its original place. The lower left leg of the nude youth (No. 696) has been added to the torso, materially changing the appearance of the figure. The more important additions to the figures of animals are the muzzle and right fore-paw of the dog (No. 143); the left fore-leg of the horse (No. 700); and both fore- legs of another horse (No. 697). The Asiatic, or Winged, Artemis. - The question of the origin and home of the Asiatic, or winged form of the rOTvLa O&amp;ip~v has to be discussed anew since the discovery at the shrine of Artemis Orthia, at Sparta, of a vast number of votive offerings in ivory, bone, lead, and terra-cotta, in which the goddess is represented as mistress of the animal and vegetable worlds, and usually, though not always, with wings. These go back to the very beginning of the Dorian epoch here, appearing along with geometric pottery toward the end of the ninth century. This evidence, together with the distribution and dates of the comparatively few examples of the type found elsewhere, suggests that Orthia, the "upright," is a local form of the pre-Hellenic and, originally, aniconic nature-goddess of Crete and Aegean lands, which received influences from the region of Asiatic winged divinities in the unsettled period following the break-up of Cretan supremacy, when an Achaean-Dorian route of communication was established across the southern Aegean to Thera, Rhodes, Cyprus, and the interior of Asia Minor, but that it never had anything to do with Ionian Asia Minor. The occa- sional appearance of a winged male deity in the same place shows a survival of the old conception of a divine pair in which the female idea predominated. The winged type continued through the sixth century, but finally died out as Orthia, like so many other local goddesses with very primitive cults, and became more fully identified with one form of Artemis. In the time of Pausanias (V, 19, 5, chest of Cypselus) it was no longer intelligible. (M. S. THOMPSON, J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 286-307; 13 figs.) The Sculptures of the Treasury of the Cnidians.--The assembly of the gods and the gigantomnachy on the Treasury of the Cnidians at Delphi are discussed by G. KARO in Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 167-178 (pl.;</page><page sequence="15">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONST, 1909 219 2 figs.). The two slabs containing the assembly of the gods were not contiguous. Between them is to be assumed, perhaps, one of the battles before Troy (Achilles and Memnon?). The gods are identified as follows, beginning at the left end: 1. Ares; 2. Leto; 3. Artemis; 4. Apollo; 5. Dionysus; 6. (Hermes); (Battle scene); 7, 8. (Zeus, Hera or Hera, Zeus); 9. Athena; 10, 11. Demeter and Kore; 12, 13, 14. (Perhaps Aphro- dite, Poseidon, Hephaestus, on missing corner slab). No. 5 is Dionysus, because, on the supports of his throne, a maenad pursued by Silenus is rep- resented. In his right hand he held a bronze vine, in his left a thyrsus. No. 4, Apollo, held a bronze bow and arrow in his left hand. In the gigantomachy, Karo agrees with Lechat in making "Hephaestus" Hermes and in restoring the name Cybele to the figure in the chariot drawn by lions. Romaios's identification of the god at the left end as Hephaestus is accepted. He is heating pieces of iron in an oven (traces of which remain) with the help of bellows. The gigantomnachy seems to have been derived from a painting. The Acanthus Column at Delphi. - In J. Int. Arch. Num. X, 1907 (published 1909), pp. 295-310 (pl.; 7 figs.), A. D. KERAMOPOULLOS argues that the column at Delphi with leaves about it and three female figures at the top, called by Homolle the "acanthus column," really represents a sil- phium stalk. It was erected about 400 B.c., by the inhabitants of Ampelus in Cyrenaica (Schol. Arist. Plut. 925). The three figures are nymphs, Hesperides, not Caryatids. Two stones of the base are still in position near the site of the tripod of Gelon. The Athena of the Marsyas Group.-- In Jh. Oest. Arch. L. XII, 1909, pp. 154-165 (4 pls.; 7 figs.), L. POLLAK publishes a statue of Athena, 1.73 m. high, found in Rome about twenty-five years ago and now in Frankfort a. M. (Fig. 1). The body is of Pentelic, and the head of Parian marble. The face is perfectly preserved, although both arms and the left foot are broken off. One of the hands still exists, grasping the handle of a spear. The goddess wears a Doric chiton without the aegis, and upon her head a Corinthian helmet. Pollak identifies the statue as the Athena of the group of Athena and Marsyas by Myron. A Hermes of Polyclitus.- A Polyclitan head in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, catalogued there as a head of a youth and generally regarded as of the Doryphorus type, belongs in a separate small group with the Boboli Hermes at Florence, a head in the Hermitage Museum, and one in the Museo Torlonia, all marble, and a bronze statuette from Anndcy, now at Paris. The various attributes given to these copies--petasos, head-wings, infant Dionysus, and kerykeion - are, all but the last, false additions of the copyists, but they serve to identify the original as a Hermes. The statuette gives the correct attitude, and the Boston head, which is much the best of the marble copies, gives us some idea of the extreme delicacy of modelling to which the beauty of Polyclitus's work in bronze was attributed by the ancients. In the conception as a whole, which is that of a physically beau- tiful youth, we can also see why Quintilian denied this artist the highest conception of divinity : nam ut humanae formae decorem addiderit supra verum, ita non explevisse deorumn auctoritatem videtur. (J. SIEVEKING, Jb. Arch. I. XXIV, 1909; pp. 1-7; 2 pls.; 7 figs.) The Diadumenus and the Doryphorus of Polyclitus. - In Jh. Oest</page><page sequence="16">220 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 FIGURE 1. --ATHENA (BY MYRON ?) AT FRANKFORT.</page><page sequence="17">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 221 Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 100-117 (6 figs.), F. HAUSER, replying to Loewy, supports his original argument that the Diadumenus of Polyclitus really represents Apollo, producing as further evidence a coin of Delphi and a bronze statuette also found at Delphi. He argues further, that the Dory- phorus does not represent an athlete, but the hero Achilles. The figure nudus talo incessens (Pliny, N.H. XXXIV, 55), he explains as a pancratiast stand- ing on one foot, with the other raised, in the attitude of a statuette found at Autun and now in the Louvre (REINACH, Re;pertoire, II, p. 543, No. 4). The Bronze Head of a Victor at Olympia.--In Sitzb. Berl. Akad. 1909, pp. 694-706 (pl.; 2 figs.), R. KEKULE V. STRADONITZ discusses the bronze portrait head at Olympia, and Greek portrait sculpture in general. He regards the head on grounds of style as a work of the fifth century B.c. The difference between the "ideal" and the "iconic" statues at Olympia was due, not to any rule that only those who had been victorious three times might erect portrait statues (Plin. N.H. XXXIV, 16), or the like, but more probably to the fact that many statues of victors were erected long after the victories, even after the death of the persons represented, and such statues were necessarily "ideal." Pliny and others explained the difference in their own more or less fanciful way. The Artemis Soteira of Cephisodotus.--In Jh. Oest. Arch. L XII, 1909, pp. 185-197 (2 pls.; 5 figs.), V. MAccHIORo publishes a small marble head at Pavia, and argues that it is a copy of the head of the Artemis Soteira of Cephisodotus. He also traces the so-called Sardanapalus at Naples to Cephisodotus. A Praxitelean Group.-- A statue of the youthful Dionysus, of Pentelic marble, which was found at Rome in 1886, on the site of the barracks of the Equites Singulares, and is now at Lugano, corresponds so exactly in dimen- sions and attitude to the Praxitelean young satyr pouring wine, as to suggest that they belong together. When they are so placed, with the look of both directed toward the cup held between them, the satyr as well as the god is seen to gain greatly in significance. Thus, we probably have what has heretofore been lacking, an example of a group by Praxiteles, and in par- ticular the group with a boy-satyr offering a cup to Dionysus, which Pausa- nias mentions (I, 20, 1) as among the monuments on the Street of Tripods at Athens. These figures belong to the early period, when Praxiteles was under Peloponnesian influence. No replica of the Dionysus is known, but echoes of its attitude and of the drapery, which is especially fine and bears comparison with that of the Hermes, can be traced in various statues, reliefs, and coins of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. (H. G. EVELYN- WHITE, J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 251-263; 4 figs.) A Praxitelean Eros.--A statue of Eros, lacking head and hands, which was found on the site of Nicopolis ad Istrum in 1900, is considered by B. FILOW, chiefly on the evidence of coins, to be an Antonine copy of the Eros of Parium by Praxiteles. The original appears to have been an early work, not far in date from the Eros of Thespiae, and still exhibiting Poly- clitan influence. (Jb. Arch. I. XXIV, 1909, pp. 60-73; pl.; 3 figs.) A Praxitelean Head found in Chios.- A technical study by J. MAR- SHALL, of the Chian head of a youthful goddess (Ant. Denk. II, P1. 59) which is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is published (in English) in Jb. Arch. I. XXIV, 1909, pp. 73-98 (13 figs.). The geometrical scheme</page><page sequence="18">222 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIV, 1910 and the great subtlety of modelling to which the head owes its unique charm are explained and compared in detail with the heads by Praxiteles that are known in copies and with the Hermes of Olympia; and the con- clusion is reached that the Chian head answers so exactly to the character- istics of the master, as distinguished from his contemporaries, followers, and imitators, as to create a presumption that this is a work of his own hand. Matters incidentally discussed are: the significance and effect of the geo- metric structure in sculpture and some of its peculiar features, such as the unnatural breadth of the nose; the gradual decay of technical knowledge and artistic conception in the succeeding centuries; the real centre (Athens) of the art known as Alexandrian; and the reasons for variation in Roman copies of great works, made from casts. In a note on jypd'y, T' jypd/, as applied to the eye, the ancient passages which discuss the quality are quoted, and the meaning is shown to be an effect of relaxation of the muscles, which is much more often a good than a bad quality, and which covers a wider range of ideas than any single English word can express. Timotheus and Bryaxis. - In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 91-135 (3 pls.; 23 figs.), W. AMELUNG undertakes to determine the characteristics of the style of Timotheus and of Bryaxis. Starting with fragments from Epidau- rus which may with some probability be attributed to Timotheus, he argues that the torso of a Leda in Boston, a statuette of Hygieia from Epidaurus, an Aphrodite at Mantua, and the first part of the Amazon frieze from the Mausoleum should be assigned to him. These will serve as a means of con- necting with him other statues. The style of Bryaxis is decorative, and at the same time shows a largeness of conception. The Zeus of Otricoli, a Serapis at Alexandria, a heroic head in the Capitoline Museum, a head in the Villa Albani, a Zeus or Poseidon in Madrid, a Poseidon in the Lateran, a statuette of HIeracles in the Villa Albani, and the fourth part of the Amazon frieze from the Mausoleum are to be assigned to him. His influence may be detected in Attic grave reliefs and in the Demneter of Cnidus. The Maiden of Antium. - In Hava9va~ca, X, 1909, pp. 58-59, A. S. ARVANITOPOULLOS suggests that the "Maiden of Antium" (see A.J.A. VIII, p. 307; XI, pp. 356 and 460; XII, p. 224) is a copy of the statue of Praxilla by Lysippus. Euphranor.- Starting with the literary traditions of Euphranor, J. Six discusses the relations of this artist, who was both painter and sculptor, to Parrhasius and Zeuxis on the one hand, and to Polyclitus and Lysippus on the other, and seeks to get an idea of his work from that of the artists who must have influenced him and been influenced by him. For the human figure he seems to have had a definite canon of proportions of height, but to have made the head and arms too heavy for the somewhat slender body. Among the works the originals of which may be assigned to him are: the Eleusinian Eubuleus head, the so-called heads of Virgil, the Alexander Rondanini at Munich, the Paris of the Vatican, and the Poseidon of the Lateran, as well as an Achilles with Chiron on a wall-painting from Herculaneum. These all show the characteristic heavy head of hair, large, square face, and, where preserved, rather thick arms. (Jb. Arch. I. XXIV, 1909, pp. 7-27; 10 figs.) A Greek Portrait Head. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 198-206 (pl.; 2 figs.), A. HEKLER publishes a male portrait head from Cataio near Padua, now in Vienna. It is of Pentelic marble and in style resembles the</page><page sequence="19">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 223 head of the Demosthenes by Polyeuctus. It is a fine example of Greek por- traiture, but it cannot as yet be identified. A late copy of the same original is in the Museo delle Terme at Rome. Greek Grave Monuments in Munich.-- In Miin. Jb. Bild. K. 1909, pp. 1-21 (pl.; 9 figs.), P. WOLTERS discusses the Greek grave reliefs in the Glyptothek at Munich. Only one of them is a recent acquisition, a stele with a loutrophoros carved upon it, received in 1908. Greek Grave Reliefs from Southern Russia. - In Griechische Grab- reliefs aus Siidrussland (Berlin, 1909, G. Reimer. 148 pp.; 56 pls.; 16 figs. Folio. M. 50), GANGOLF VON KIESERITZKY and CARL WATZINGER publish a corpus of the Greek grave reliefs from southern Russia. They have ar- ranged the stelae according to subject into various classes, such as the slabs without figures; those with a seated woman; a standing woman; a standing man; a horseman; a funeral banquet; half figures of men; and half figures of women. Each relief is described and its bibliography given. The greater part of the material for the work was collected by Kieseritzky, who died in 1904; the arrangement for publication was the work of Watzinger. Grave Reliefs with Dolls.--In 'E4~. 'ApX. 1909, cols. 121-132 (pl.; 4 figs.), P. KASTRIOTES discusses the meaning of the dolls that appear on seven of the Attic grave reliefs, arguing that they do not symbolize the soul, as is generally believed, but are merely playthings of the deceased. Most of them have detached hands and feet, and in one or two cases the doll is handed to the deceased girl by a slave! Two of the seven reliefs are here published for the first time. A Bronze Statuette of a Gaul. - In the sixty-ninth "Winckelmanns- programm "of the Berlin Archaeological Society, R. KEKULE V. STRADONITZ publishes and discusses a bronze statuette of a fighting Gaul, recently ac- quired by the Berlin Museum. The Gaul is characterized by his torques and sword belt. In his left hand is a small, plum-shaped object, no doubt a sling-shot. The sling was doubtless in the right hand. The left arm once bore a shield. This statuette, said to have been found at Rome, is derived from a group which dated from the second third of the third century B.C., earlier, that is, than the Pergamene statues. Many representa- tions of Gauls are discussed. The attack uppon Delphi in 279 B.C. was the probable occasion of many such representations. The bronze statuette from Telamon is some fifty years later.

SVORONOS, publishing a charming marble statuette repre- senting a little boy and a fox-goose (described in Friederichs-Wolters, Gipsabgiisse, No. 1590), which has recently been placed in the National Museum at Athens, argues that the numerous examples of this class, com- monly regarded as genre sculpture, have in reality a mythological and religious significance. The goose was a sacred bird of Asclepius, and all these goose-and-child groups whose original location can be traced come from sanctuaries of Asclepius. The author maintains that the various types of boy-and-goose generally represent 'Iav'(rKo%, the youngest son of</page><page sequence="20">224 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 Asclepius (mentioned by Schol. ad. Arist. Plut. 701), whose name offers the best solution of the text corruption in Pliny's description of Boethus's group of the Boy Strangling a Goose, Nat. Hist. XXXIV, 84, infans eximium anseremrn strangulat. (The best MS. has sex annis, which may well be a cor- ruption of IANNIS9 [&gt;VI ANNIS].) Herondas, Mim. IV, 26-34, describes a similar group, which, however, must antedate that of Boethus. The y~povra there referred to was probably a statue of Hippocrates. Other so- called genre figures represent Asclepius as an infant, others one of his daughters with a goose. The statuette here published, found in Phocis near one of the chief sources of the Boeotian Cephissus, probably stood upon an inscribed base which has disappeared. (I. G. Sept. 232; Evo axrv E.vostpa 'AvYpo'cKOv Ka~L4~ 4.) If so, instead of Ianiscus we here have a statue of a boy named Andriscus set up as a votive offering to the Cephissus, whose springs are sources of healing and accordingly closely associated with Asclepius, or the name may be a diminutive of 'Avsprv', son of the Thes- salian river Peneus, who settled on the banks of the Cephissus and became identified with it, the statue representing him in his boyhood. The stran- gling of the goose, which is a symbol of the fever-breeding pools and marshes, typifies the healing of fevers by Asclepius and his family. The Spinario of the Capitol is probably IIo&amp;1XdpLos, another son of Asclepius. Dionysus learning to Walk. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. L XII, 1909, pp. 215-223 (pl.; 3 figs.), H. SITTE publishes part of a marble sarcophagus relief in a villa near Vienna. At the left stands a nude boy, and from his left shoulder hangs a garland of leaves and fruits which runs along the lower part of the relief. Above this two seated satyrsbend forward towards an infant who stands on a pedestal, resting his right hand on the back of one of the satyrs. At the left is a nymph looking on. The scene is inter- preted as the infant Dionysus learning to walk. The same subject is found on two late sarcophagi, one in Munich and the other in the Capitoline Museum in Rome. The original was probably the work of an Alexandrian sculptor. Representations of the Satyr Drama. --In A bh. Sdichs. Ges. XXVII (No. 22), 1909, pp. 761-779 (3 pls.; 4 figs.), T. SCHREIBER discusses six reliefs upon which are figures of youthful satyrs, one dancing, and above under a tree a seated muse holding a Silenus mask. In front of her is a large box beside which stands a youthful attendant holding the double flute. Two of the reliefs have but part of the scene. The writer argues that they represent the satyr drama. Reproductions of Ancient Sculptures at Stettin. - In Museumskunde, V, 1909, pp. 129-135 (5 figs.), J. SIEVEKING calls attention to the importance of reproductions of ancient sculptures and urges that they should be made to appear as nearly as possible like the original works. Thus statues of which the originals were bronze, but which are now known only from marble copies, should be restored in bronze. The museum at Stettin has several familiar figures so restored. The Frankish Inscription on the Mausoleum Frieze.- Block 1010 of the Amazon frieze from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of twelve stones brought to England in 1846 from the castle of St. Peter, of the Knights Hospitallers at Budrum, bears a badly defaced inscription out in three lines across the shield of one of the combatants.

They seem to refer to Christoph Waldener, of the Tongue, Germany, who was Castellan of Rhodes in 1522. He may have been captain or visitor at Budrum in 1510. The last part of line 2 is uncertain and may be part of some extraor- dinary spelling of this or some other name. (F. W. HASLUCK, J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 366-367.) VASES AND PAINTING An Amphora of the Dipylon Style.-- In Bulletin des muse'es royaux z Bruxelles, I, 1908, pp. 18-21 (2 figs.), J. DE MOT describes an amphora of the Dipylon style, 0.87 m. high, found near Patissia and now in Brussels. Aristophanes and Vase Paintings.- In Jb. Oest. Arch. I. XLI, 1909, pp. 80-100 (pl.; 8 figs.), F. HAUSER shows that certain more or less obscure passages in Aristophanes are illustrated by vase paintings. These are 4atvoioav, Eccl. 93; the use of the lamp, Eccl. 13; and J 7' 'A$movtacrp oiros ov%- i&amp;v ry&amp;v, Lys. 389. In connection with the scholiurn on Eccl. 1, he calls attention to two representations of the potter's wheel not hitherto noticed. The poet's allusions to vase painting were perhaps called forth by the fact that there was a contemporary vase painter of the same name. The Omphalos.- On an Attic black-figured hydria with white field, which was found in Melos, two satyrs stand gesticulating on either side of an egg-shaped mound decorated with branches, while a bird of prey is perched on the mound and a doe is shown in white silhouette against it. The details of the picture are found separately on other vases, and the scene as a whole illustrates Miss J. Harrison's observations on the omphalos as at the same time tomb and dwelling of the spirit. (E. ROESE, Arch. Anz. 1909, cols. 30-33; fig.) Danae.- In TJh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 165-171 (8 figs.), R. ENGEL- MANN publishes an amphora in the museum at Arezzo on which a young woman stands before an open chest talking with an older woman, while behind the lid stands a youth. He argues that this represents Danae. Two other unpublished illustrations of the Danae story, one on a crater in Syra- cuse and the other on a mosaic from Thenae in Northern Africa, are reproduced. Heracles and Dionysus in a Gigantomachy.-In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 57-70 (9 figs.), M. JATTA publishes a South Italian amphora a colonette from Ceglie del Campo, now in the museum at Bari. It dates from the fourth century B.c. and is decorated on one side with a gigantomachy in which Dionysus and Heracles play the most important parts. Jatta finds in this scene a fifth century motive modified by Hellenistic ideas. On the other side of the vase Dionysus appears seated and talking with a youthful satyr while a maenad stands on either side. A Painted Gravestone from Athens. - On a painted Attic stele in Munich, with loutrophoros in relief (cf. p. 223), several short cylindrical objects are seen lying on the ground or hanging beside the vase. These are inter- preted by P. WOLTERs as rolls of woollen bands of various colors, to be used in decorating a grave, and they are to be compared with certain square objects in the head-piece of some gravestones in relief. (Jb.

INSCRIPTIONS The Disk from Phaestus. - In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 255-302 (5 pls.; 19 figs.), L. PERNIER discusses at length the disk from Phaestus (A.J.A. XIII, pp. 78 and 500), and the significance and grouping of the signs. In Sitzb. Berl. A kad. XLI, 1909, pp. 1022-1029, E. MEYER argues in opposition to Pernier that the writing on the disk runs from the outer edge to the centre. He thinks it the work of the Philistines, but believes with Pernier that some of the characters show Cretan influence. The Inscription from Aegiale.- In R. 15t. Gr. XXII, 1909, pp. 241-250, T. REINACH discusses the provisions of the mortgage in the inscription from Aegiale (lines 10-14), and the proper restoration of the number in line 14 (see A.J.A. XII, p. 360; XIII, p. 501). The Laws of Gortyns. - In Abh. Sachs. Ges. XXVII, 1909, pp. 390-420 (No. 11), IIERMANN LIPSIUS discusses various points in the laws of Gortyns, especially the relations of the different classes of the population and the divisions of the people. Inscriptions from Delphi. -- In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 151-153, W. CRi)NERT discusses eight of the inscriptions found by Pomtow at Delphi and published in Berl. Phil. W. 1909, Nos. 5-12. In B.C.H. XXXIII, 1909, pp. 440-442, A. D. KERAMOPOULLOS publishes further notes on an inscribed bronze basin found at Delphi (cf. ibid. XXXII, 1908, pp. 445-448), and on a second basin published by Perdrizet, Fouilles de Delphes, V, p. 70, Fig. 228 b. The Base of the Charioteer at Delphi. - In Ath. Mlitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 33-60 (3 figs.), A. D. KERAMOPOULLOS gives a revised reading of the erased inscription on the base of the charioteer at Delphi and proposes the following restoration: Ec,4~dvo'd ye rIXov ho] EX;a AVEOCKE favO (r[ov Aaevoplvvr hvuLs 7T]V v d' r;6vvi" A roAXX [ov. The first line might also be read: IIv0LovZKa I'Xov pE] TrXaS K.T.X. The phrase rPXag &amp;vo--rwv dates the victory in the year 486 B.c. The statue was ready to be set up at the time of Gelo's death (478). It was actually set up by Polyzelus soon after that event and the inscription changed to read as follows :- MrTza Xwrvo T rJjse II]oXvaXo E/l' vOKrlKC, ?AcvolECver hbsT 7-iv dEl' aovv' Y'"AroX [ov. The delay of eight years is to be explained by the warfare against the Carthaginians. Keramopoullos believes the group to have been the work of Glaucias of Aegina, who made the similar group at Olympia. In .J. Int. Arch. Num. XI, 1908 (published 1909), pp. 233-235 (fig.), J. SUNDWALL argues that the reading proposed by Keramopoullos is essentially correct. There is, however, no  between the letters read as C and A at the begin-</page><page sequence="23">GREEK INSc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 227 ning. The horizontal strokes are marks of the tool used in erasing the inscription, as the spacing shows. He also finds no trace of ? before the ninth letter, h. The last five letters are certainly ANAM . He agrees with Pomtow that the inscription began at the left of the second stone of the base, ran across the third, i.e. the existing stone, and over the edge of the fourth. Seventeen letters are lost at the beginning. The Parthenon Treasure Lists.- Three new fragments of the annual lists of offerings and other valuables kept in the Parthenon are published by A. M. WOODWARD in J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 168-191. They are now in the Epigraphical Museum at Athens. All are of Pentelic marble. Although they throw no new light on the history of the stewardship of the treasures, they supply several lacunae in the published lists and give one or two new items. (1) In the old Attic alphabet, with retrograde sigma, parts of lines 7-12 in LG. I, 171, of the year 421 B.C. It confirms the number of OrdTnXVC as 12 and gives their weight as 184 drachmas. (2) The left side of I.G. II, 2, 665, with parts of 21 lines, leaving a gap between the two stones. Among the items are: the rare object cvaiLcrXaXuarvp, ornament for securing a garment from slipping off the shoulder; some object with a border, possibly the sacred peplos, which weighed 66 drachmas, 3 obols; an "ointment box " in which were kept the dies, mallets, and anvils (xapaKT2P Cr, a~fpac, and &amp;K/o- vUTKOL) used for striking gold coins; chips of ivory; studs with ornamented heads and other silvered or gilt decorations from the door of the Hecatom- pedon, date, 385-375 B.C. Other inscriptions for which this supplies missing items are I.G. II, 2, 666; 672; 694; 697. (3) Part of a list in columnar form, two columns, with weights in the space between, which belong to items in the right-hand column, date, 375-369 B.C. It supplies gaps, especially in I.G. II, 2, 677 and 678, about the two OvILWaXlTpta which were stamped with an Alpha and a Beta. Researches in Athenian and Delian Documents. - In Klio, IX, 1909, pp. 304-340, W. S. FERGUSON completes his series of studies in Athenian and Delian inscriptions. He shows (1) that the Athenian Pythais came at irregular intervals down to 94-93 B.c., when it became annual, but that it did not continue after 87-86 B.C. (2) He also discusses the dates at which the ten generals had specific duties assigned them and became civil and military magistrates. (3) He shows, furthermore, that there was at Athens between the time of Sulla and the later aristocratic rigime a period of popu- lar influence which must have extended from about 70 B.c. to about 53 B.c. Problems connected with the priests at Delos and the dating of the archon Lysiades are also considered. Greek Inscriptions from Babylon --In Klio, IX, 1909, pp. 352-363, B. HAUSSOULLIER discusses three Greek inscriptions from Babylon. The most important dates from 109 B.C. and records the distribution of prizes in the gymnasium at Babylon.

In the Boeotian musical festivals 5 iwmvlKLo (sc. 1/LvoS) was also an &amp;~byv &amp;h rivov, or a contest in which all the agonistae took part, as is shown by the fact that the victor in it is often the same as the victor in one of the earlier contests. Inscriptions from Erythrae and Chios.- In Jh. Oest. Arch. L XII, 1909, pp. 126-150 (3 figs.), A. WILHELM discusses two inscriptions in the collection of G. J. Zolotas of Chios published in 'AOprv, XX, pp. 113ff.; and an inscription relating to the selling of fish at Eleusis found at the Piraeus and published in IacXryycvcla, January 11, 1868, and elsewhere.

The bare field belonged to Charinus, the improvements to the tenant. The second inscription may be transliterated: TLLoFdpVaKTOS 7T Tqzd'ev (or -yv) Iptl. The discussion is concerned chiefly with points of dialect and grammar. A Cypriote Ostrakon.--In Abh. Sdchs. Ges.

GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Date of the Cretan-MIycenaean Culture. --In his Zeit und Daner der Kretisch-Myke~nischen Kultur (Leipzig und Berlin, 1909, Teubner. 107 pp. M. 3), D. FIMMEN examines the evidence for dating the so-called Cretan-Mycenaean civilization, drawing up a synchronistic table as follows: (1) Before 3000 B.C. the first two dynasties of Egypt; the neolithic culture of Cnossus and Phaestus, as well as that of Dimini, and Sesklo, of Phocis and Boeotia. (2) 3000-2000 B.c., the third to the eleventh dynasties in Egypt; Early Minoan periods I, II, and III at Cnossus; the early culture of the Cyclades; Orchomenus II; and the earliest remains at Tiryns; Troy I and II; the oldest graves of Cyprus. (3) 2000-1700 B.C., the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties of Egypt; Middle Minoan periods I and II; the later culture of the Cyclades; Phylakopi I and II; early remains at Aphidua, Aegina, and Argos. (4) 1700-1550, the Hyksos period, and the begin- ning of the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt; Middle Minoan III and Late Minoan I; the shaft graves at Mycenae. (5) 1550-1400 B.C., the remainder of the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt; Late Minoan II at Cnossus; Phyla- kopi III; the palaces of Mycenae and Tiryns. (6) 1400-1250 B.c., Ame- nophis III and IV, and the nineteenth dynasty; Late Minoan III; late Mycenaean styles at Phylakopi, as well as at Tiryns and Mycenae; Troy VI and VII, 1; Ialysus; Enkomri in Cyprus. (7) 1250 and later, the twen- tieth dynasty in Egypt; geometric decoration; local Mycenaean vases of Cyprus. The Discoveries in Crete and their Relation to the History of Egypt and Palestine.- In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXI, 1909, pp. 221-238 (2 pls.), H. R. HALL continues his discussion of the discoveries in Crete and their relation to the history of Egypt and Palestine (see A.J.A. XIII, p. 503). Among other points, he discusses: (1) the theory of the Aegean origin of the spiral motive, giving evidence to show that the Egyptians imported it from the Aegean region about the end of the Old Kingdom; (2) the evidence that the Cretans borrowed from Egypt the art of glazing pottery, but gave the Egyptians in turn the idea of polychrome pottery; (3) the origin and affiliations of the Minoan method of writing; (4) the relation of Cretan civilization to that of Cyprus; (5) the theory that the Philistines were originally Aegeans.</page><page sequence="27">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 231 Cretan Palaces and the Aegean Civilization. - In B.S.A. XIV (Ses- sion 1907-1908), pp. 343-422 (21 figs.), D. MACKENZIE presents the fourth part of his discussion of Cretan palaces. He finds that no part of the Medi- terranean region shows the exclusive use of either the round or the rectan- gular hut from the very beginniing. In Sardinia round dwellings only are found, but tombs are rectangular; in Crete only rectangular dwellings have been found, but round tombs are common. The round hut originates among nomads, aud nomadic habits cannot persist on the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean. In the Danube valley the round hut is of eastern origin. The Nordic house and the central-hearth house of the Balkan Peninsula are cognate Mediterranean types, but neither is derived from the other. Pre- historic rectangular dwellings in the eastern Mediterranean region are dis- cussed in detail. An important matter is the central position of the hearth. This involves isolation of the room containing the hearth, and when the addition of other rooms causes draughts to blow the smoke about the hearth has to be moved. In Crete and the islands of the Aegean, a continuous fire was not needed, and the portable hearth was introduced very early. This made the avoidance of draughts unnecessary and led eventually to the elab- orate arrangement of connecting rooms seen in the great Cretan palaces. Thessaly developed later than Crete. In some b'ut and b'en houses at Dimini and Sesklo the hearth was moved to avoid draughts. The isolated megaron of the Mycenaean palaces of the Greek mainland is a reversion to the type of the primitive central-hearth hut. The elliptical house at Chamaizy is a sporadic development from the rectangular house. Throughout this article Noack's views are criticised freely. The Bull-ring in Crete. - In A th. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 85-99 (pl.; 13 figs.), A. REICHEL collects and discusses the illustrations in Mycenaean art of acrobats performing feats of strength and skill with bulls. He suggests that these spectacles may have had a religious significance, citing the con- nection of bulls with the cults of Zeus and Poseidon in later times. A Bird Cult in Egypt and in Crete.-In Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology, II, 1909, pp. 49-51, P. E. NEWBERRY points out the connection of the cults of the Double Axe and of the Wr-bird in the Old Kingdom in Egypt and similar cults depicted on the sarcophagus from Hagia Triada in Crete. The Early History of the Argive Heraeum. - The existence of a bee- hive tomb at the Heraeum proves that there was a Mycenaean stronghold in the immediate viciiiity. This is to be sought on the highest terrace of the Heraeumn hill, above that occupied by the old temple. This has not been excavated, though there are remains of house walls in the neighborhood, and the place is strewn with Mycenaean sherds. The fortification walls were probably used later as building material. The fortress was destroyed near the close of the Mycenaean period, and the sanctuary was founded by the conquerors. The stories of Jo and of the Danaids, which are closely con- nected with the Heraeum, perhaps originated in this Mycenaean settlement. (PAUL FRIEDLANDER, Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 69-79.) The Beehive Tombs at Kakovatos.- The finds in the three beehive tombs described by Ddrpfeld (4Ath. Mitt. XXXIII, 1908, pp. 295 ff.; cf. A.J.A. XIII, 1909, p. 79). are published by K. MiULLER in Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 269-328 (13 pls.; 17 figs.). Among the gold objects a pendant in the</page><page sequence="28">232 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 form of a toad is most noteworthy. Numerous fragments of amber were found. Like that discovered in the shaft graves at Mycenae, it came from the Baltic. The pottery consists chiefly of the remains of large amphoras (Figs. 2 and 3) more or less fragmentary (some twenty-two in all). These vases find closer parallels at Mycenae and else- where on the mainland than in Crete. In style they belong to about the begin- ning of the second Late Minoan period. The contents of the tombs as a whole point to a slightly later date than that of the shaft graves at Mycenae. The Fortress of Kalydona.- The fortress of Kalydona or Gyphtokastro to the east of Kakovatos is described by H. G. PRINGSHEIMi in Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 179-182. It is situated on a steep rock, 7 knm. from the sea, and con- tains a lower and an upper citadel. Though the evidence of the walls (small slabs of limestone laid rather carefully without mortar) and the vase fragments is inconclusive, he believes the fortress to be pre-Dorian. The Pelargicon.--In Das Pelargikon, Untersuchungen zur dltesten Befes. tigung der Akropolis von Athen (Strassburg, 1909, J. HI. E. Heitz. 42 pp.; 6 pls.) A. KijSTER argues that the oldest walls of the Acropolis were built in the second millennium B.C. They ran around the upper part of the rock and had their principal entrance on the north side, a little to the east of the Erechtheum, and another entrance at the northwest corner. There was no entrance on the west side. This was the Pelargicon. Towards the end of the second millennium an enlargement was made to the west and the Nine Gates built. The name Pelargicon was then transferred to this wall. In the time of Pisistratus the highest of these gates was strongly fortified, but the walls were destroyed at the downfall of the tyrants. The writer also discusses the walls of Cimron. The Homeric Shield with One Handle. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I..XII, 1909, pp. 1-70 (45 figs.), W. HELBIG traces the history of the Homeric round shield with one handle in Mesopotamrnia, Syria, Egypt, and Greece, including Crete, down through the geometric period into classical times. Parallels between Greek Art and Greek Poetry.- In Jb. Kil. Alt. XXIII, 1909, pp. 681-712, F. WYINTER points out resemblances between Greek art and Greek poetry. In Homer various passages may be illustrated by works of Creto-Mycenaean art; while in other passages the poet seems to have had in mind some painted scene. So, too, the lyric poets, Pindar, and the great dramatists reflect the spirit of contemporary art. Compare, for example, with Pindar the sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, and with Sophocles the sculptures of the Parthenon. Delphica.--InB.C.H. XXXIII, 1909, pp. 201-237 (3 pls.; 9 figs.; cf. p. 436), G. KARO discusses (1) the Treasuries of Corinth and Acanthus. FIGURE 2.- VASE FROM KAKOVATOS.</page><page sequence="29">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 233 Some remains of the foundation of the former exist east of the sacred way, opposite the southeast end of the great supporting wall. Some walls lying to the north of the path which leads past this foundation to an eastern postern belong to the Treasury of Acan- thus. The Treasury of Clazomenae is per- haps to be identified with the archaic foun- dation to the east of the tripods of Gela. (2) The Ion of Eurip- ides and the Treas- ury of the Cnidians. In the first chorus of the Ion the words dyvdrLTie OEpaLrTEaL and 8ti4,Sov spoao- 7trov KaXt/3XELcapov 4^o (11. 185 ft.) refer to the caryatids of the Cnidian or Siphnian Treasury. The group of Heracles slaying the hydra (1. 190) is to be identified with that of Tisagoras (Paus. X, 18, 6). The gigantomachy de- scribed in lines 206 ff. is the north frieze of the Cnidian Treasury. (3) The Monument of Aegospotami. The identification of the rectangular niche on the north side of the sacred way with the dedication of Lysander after Aegospotami is wrong. These statues possibly stood on the south side of the road immediately next to the gate. The Treasury of the Cnidians at Delphi.--An examination of Homolle's restoration of the Treasury of the Cnidians at Delphi shows that the gable is too broad to be brought into connection with the foundations and the dedicatory inscription on the step. The slabs of the frieze are to be divided into two groups on stylistic grounds. The remains, therefore, belong to three separate buildings: (1) The Treasury of the Cnidians. Its dimensions were approximately 3.50 m. by 7.80 m. The frieze was cornm- posed of battle scenes on the ends, the gigantomrnachy and the assembly of the gods on the sides. There is not room for the caryatids between the antae; they must have stood in front of the latter. (2) The Treasury of the Siphnians (4 m. by 7 m.). On one of the sides was the rape of the Leucippidae, on one of the ends the slaying of Tityus by Apollo and Artemis.

(3) A building with a tympanum 5.78 m. wide. To this belong the pedimental sculptures, the cornice, and perhaps the simrna and acroteria. To it is perhaps also to be assigned the second pair of caryatids, the greater width of the fagade allowing them to be placed between antae. (R. HEBERDEY, Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 145-166; p1.; 2 figs.) The Offering of Rhodopis at Delphi.- In J. Int. Arch. Num. X, 1907 (published 1909), pp. 287-294 (3 figs.), G. KARO argues that two stones of the base which supported the spits dedicated by Rhodopis at Delphi (Hdt. II, 134-135) are still preserved; that there was a standing female figure with the spits on end about it. Ibid. p. 367, he withdraws this conclusion and believes that these blocks formed part of the base of a bull in a field of grain, perhaps of the bull of the Corcyraeans. The Monthly Offerings at Olympia. - In Klio, IX, 1909, pp. 291-303 (plan), L. WENIGER shows that the seventy altars at which monthly offer- ings were made at Olympia were divided into two sections of fifteen different groups each. Two processions started from the Prytaneum, one visiting the altars chiefly within the precinct, and the other those chiefly outside of it. The route followed by each is given. Handbook of Greek Archaeology. - In their Greek Archaeology, IH. N. FOWLER and J. R. WHEELER publish a comprehensive survey of the whole subject. After a chapter on the study and progress of archaeology in modern times they take up in turn Prehellenic Greece; architecture (by Stevens); sculpture; terra-cottas; metal work; coins; vases; and painting and mosaic. The book is much fuller than any manual hitherto published and will serve as a complete introduction to the subject. A bibliography is appended. (Greek Archaeology, by Harold North Fowler and James Rignall Wheeler, with the collaboration of Gorham Phillips Stevens. New York, 1909, American Book Company. 559 pp.; 412 figs. $2.00.) Greek Lands and Letters. - In Greek Lands and Letters Professor and Mrs. ALLINSON publish a book intended for the lover of Greece and Greek literature. Topography, archaeology, and the Greek authors are drawn upon equally, one to illustrate the other. The book deals almost wholly with Greece proper, that is, with Attica, Central Greece, and the Peloponnesus, although casual references to the islands and the coast of Asia Minor are not lacking. The poetical translations of Greek authors are a notable feature. (Greek Lands and Letters, by F. G. and A. C. E. Allinson.

Laurens. 128 pp.; 148 figs.), E. POTTIER gives a concise account of Greek terra-cotta statuettes. He discusses their origin, object, and date; the development of the industry in Asia Minor and in Greece; its development and decline in Africa, Sicily, and Italy. The book is abundantly illustrated from the collection in the Louvre, which numbers about 4000 specimens, and to which it may serve as a guide. The name Diphilus is the most frequent of the signatures of coroplasts found at Myrina.</page><page sequence="31">GREEK MIISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 235 Terra-cottas from Samothrace. - In Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 23- 28, C. FREDRICH publishes nine terra-cotta heads from Samothrace, now in the museum at Bonn, and gives a rdsumn~ of the history of the island from 769 A.D. down to the present day. Two Hellenistic Bronze Vessels. - The two opposed tendencies in Hellenistic art, the Attic-Alexandrian, standing for a sharp distinction be- tween conventional decorative design and naturalistic representative art, and the Asiatic (Ionian)-Roman, in which the two elements are combined, are discussed by A. HEKLER in his publication of two very beautiful inlaid copper and bronze vessels at Budapest, which were found at Egyed, Hun- gary, in 1831. They represent the high-water mark of Alexandrian toreutic, about the middle of the third century B.C., and have a quite different artistic feeling from the Augustan Roman work of the Hildesheim and Boscoreale treasures. The picture designs, which are discussed by F. W. v. BISSING, a Nile scene of plant and animal life, a row of Egyptian gods and a ring of Egyptian crowns'or head ornaments show the hand of a most skilful Greek artist dealing with subjects long familiar in Egyptian art. (Jb. Arch. I. XXIV, 1909, pp. 28-46; 2 pls.; 7 figs.) The Universities of Ancient Greece. - In his Universities of Ancient Greece (New York, 1909, Charles Scribner's Sons. x, 367 pp.; 8vo; $1.50), J. W. H. WALDEN discusses higher education in the Greek world during the time of the Roman empire. After sketching the subject during the fifth and fourth centuries B.c. at Athens and then during Macedonian times, he discusses education and the state; the establishment of university educa- tion in various places; its history and decline; the appointment and num- ber of professors, their pay and position in society; the sophist's teaching, his methods and public displays; school-houses, holidays, etc.; the training of the sophist, his student days and later life. Cults of the Greek States.- The fifth and concluding volume of Dr. Farnell's Cults of the Greek States contains chapters (with references and registers as in former volumes), on Cults of Hermes, Cult-Monuments of Hermes, The Ideal of Hermes, Cults of D)ionysos, Dionysiac Ritual, Cult- Monuments of Dionysos, Ideal Dionysiac Types, Cults of Hestia, Cults of Hephaistos, Cults of Ares, and Minor Cults (Forces of Nature, Helios, etc., Rivers and Springs, Nymphs, Horae and Charites, Pan, Muses, 'EpLvv'E, etc., the Mavaet, Personifications of abstract ideas). The method is like that adopted in the earlier volumes, giving space and opportunity for many illum- inating remarks in addition to the systematic treatment of the main themes. The illustrations include two coin-plates. There is an index to the entire work. (L. R. FARNELL, The Cults of the Greek States, in five volumes, Vol. V, Oxford, 1909, Clarendon Press [London, New York, Edinburg, Toronto, Melbourne, Henry Frowde]. xii, 496 pp.; 59 pls. 8vo. 18s. 6d. net.) The Pythagorean Prohibition of Eating Beans.--In Mlemnon, III, 1909, pp. 93-96, W. SCHULTZ discusses the Pythagorean avoidance of beans, and comes to the conclusion that this was due to a philosophic conception of the universe of which the bean was chosen as the mystical symbol. The Island Psyttaleia. - In 'E4. 'ApX. 1909, cols. 45-56, P. D. RHEDI- ADES defends the traditional identification of the modern Lypsokoutala just outside the entrance of the straits of Salamis, as the ancient Psyt- taleia around which the battle of Salamis raged, citing abundant evidence</page><page sequence="32">236 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

Thasos.- The present condition of the island of Thasos (see A.J.A. XIII, pp. 84, 506; XIV, p. 112), with special reference to the ancient remains, was thoroughly studied, so far as this can be done without excavation by J. FF. BAKER-PENOYRE in the summer of 1907, and the results, topographical and general, are published with an abundance of maps, plans, and other illustra- tions in J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 202-251 (10 pls.; 25 figs.). A few notes are added on the inscriptions, which were published earlier (ibid. pp. 91-102; A.J.A. XIII, 1909, p. 358). Among the ancient works still standing or to be traced are: the city walls and acropolis of the city of Thasos on the northern coast, some parts of the acropolis being older than the sixth cen- tury; the marble quarries near the southeastern corner of the island, where two monolithic columns and other worked stones are lying abandoned; and a number of Hellenic towers dotted about the island, some of which were lighthouses, some watch towers and forts to guard the coast and the valleys running inland, and others castles of refuge in case of invasion. A quaint little shrine of Pan, made from a natural grotto and adorned with simple carving on the rock, probably in the fourth century B.c.; a fine fifth-cen- tury funeral banquet relief, and a huge apotropaic eyes-and-nose cut on the town wall, are among the objects of interest. The island is very mountain- ous and thickly wooded. Many centuries of hopeless insecurity have so reduced the inhabitants in numbers and condition that they now attempt little but a primitive agriculture and fishing, the best farms being those owned by the communities of Mount Athos; only a small fraction of the area of the ancient capital is inhabited; and the great mineral resources of the island are untouched except in one spot and by a foreign company. Both the land and the surrounding water are of extraordinary beauty, and it is to be hoped that they may again become the home of a vigorous life. The Greek Garden.- In Ath. Mitt. XXXIV, 1909, pp. 100-144, MARIE GOTHEIN gives a comprehensive survey, based on literary sources, of the gar- dens, groves, and parks in the Greek world from the age of Homer down to Byzantine times. ITALY ARCHITE CTURE The Domed Tomb at Vetulonia.-- In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 71-74 (fig.), J. DURM discusses the vault of the tomb at Vetulonia and shows that the practice of constructing'a vault with pendentives over a square chamber must be an invention of the seventh century B.c. Documents relating to the Septizonium. - In Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 253-269 (2 pls.; 6 figs.), A. BARTOLI publishes the references to the Sep- tizonium of Septimius Severus in ancient and mediaeval literature, as well as a list of the drawings and restorations of it made during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Three sketches of the monument by Martin Heemskerck made between 1532 and 1536 and not previously published are reproduced. Hadrian as a Builder.--In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVIII, 1909, pp. 172-177, T. RIVOIRA lists a number of structures built or rebuilt by Hadrian, and in discussing the arched roofs of the Pantheon, Hadrian's Villa Tiburtina, and</page><page sequence="33">ITAL. SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 237 the Temple of Venus and Roma at Rome, points to the fact that this way of building roofs was the precursor of the Lombard and Gothic arches. The article forcibly contrasts Greek and Roman architecture. The Ports Aurea of Spalato. - In discussing the decoration of the Porta Aurea at Spalato, once the north gate of Diocletian's Illyrian retreat, which is usually cited as the type of the false arcade, B. SCHULZ shows that the scheme is rather vertical than horizontal, owing to the superimposed niches of the middle and upper parts of the wall. The artistic feeling by which the ornament is concentrated and made to contrast with blank spaces, is characteristic of the architecture at the close of any long-continued period of artistic development. (Jb. Arch. I. XXIV, 1909, pp. 46-52; 3 figs.) Notes on Vitruvius. - In Harvard Studies in Classical philology, XXI, 1909, pp. 1-22, M. H. MORGAN publishes 'Critical and Explanatory Notes on Vitruvius.' The viae (93, 1 ff. = 4, 3, 6) are explained as the intervals between the guttae. The difference between albariis and tectoriis (6, 7, 3, = 149, 24) is explained as that between enriched and plain stucco. Other notes are chiefly philological. SCULPTURE The Ara Pacis.-In Abh. Sdchs. Ges. XXVII (No. 26), 1909, pp. 899- 944 (7 pls.; 5 figs.), F. STUDNICZKA discusses the new fragments of the Ara Pacis and the conclusions to be drawn from them. Some interesting results are: The identification of Claudius in the flamen formerly called Augustus by F. von Duhn, on one of the reliefs walled into the back of the Villa Medici, none of which belong to the Ara Pacis; the dating of the pro- cession represented (January 9, B.c.); the identification of the emperor's nieces, of Tiberius and his wife, of Lucius Caesar, of the pontifex (whose name cannot be given, but who is a promnagister, the Pontifex Maximus being Augustus himself), of Augustus, and of several persons among his immne- diate attendants. The sacrifice to the Penates, the place of the fragment with the ficus, the restoration of the relief with the fig tree, the Tellus relief, the coins connected with it, the fragments of the Roma, the restora- tion of the Roma relief, are discussed in more or less detail. The Antinous of Torre del Padiglione. - In A usonia, III, 1908, pp. 3-17 (3 figs.), G. E. RIzzo discusses the fine relief representing Antinous, found at Torre del Padiglione in 1907 (A.J.A. XIII, p. 93). The Great Gods of Samothrace on a Roman Relief. - In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 79-90 (fig.), R. PETTAZZONI publishes a relief in the Lateran Museum originally representing the busts of four divinities. The head of one is now missing. They are the eycdXoL OCof of Samothrace, known from a scholium to Apol. Rhod. Argon. I, 917, as Azieros (Demeter), Aziokersos (Hades), Axiokersa (Persephone), and Kadmilos (Hermes). They were also identified with the Penates. The slab was used as a lintel to the tomb of the Ilaterii, probably by a member of the family who had been initiated into the mysteries of the Cabiri. It dates from about 100 A.D. The Marble Base from the Villa Patrizi.- In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 235-254 (3 pls.; 14 figs.), G. CULTRERA discusses the marble base found with many small fragments in the Villa Patrizi, and now in the Museo delle Terme. The monument consisted of floral decorations and figures and seems to have borne some resemblance to the tropaeum from</page><page sequence="34">238 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

The Classical Sculptures of the Villa d' Este. -In Archaeologia, LXI, 1908, pp. 219-256 (10 pls.; fig.), T. ASHBY discusses the classical sculptures once in the Villa d' Este at Tivoli, and gives their present whereabouts so far as they are known. Gallic Funerary Stelae in Liguria. - In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 52- 54 (3 figs.), H. HUBERT publishes two stelae found in Liguria. One, now in the Museo Civico at Genoa, is surmounted by a male head and bears the inscription Mlezunemnusus in early Greek letters. The other is not only sur- mounted by a head, but the front represents in rude relief the rest of a nude belted man, bearing an axe, two darts, and a dagger. A few other similar stelae are known. The weapons, etc., are Gallic, and the stelae doubtless marked the graves of Gauls. VASES Apulian Vases. - The Reimers vase collection in Hamburg contains miore than fifty funeral vases of Apulian ware, chiefly from the district of Bari, which have designs in white, yellow, and red paint, and incised lines, over a black or blackish glaze, imitating metal. They are distinguished from Campanian vases by a strip of unglazed clay surface just above the foot. The decoration consists of network, lines, dots, garlands of foliage and flowers, with objects of still life, animals and heads, but seldom a full figure. They form a class called by Lenormant Gnathia ware, from the town of Egnazia, on the coast between Monopoli and Fasano, but the place of manufacture is uncertain. They date from the end of the fourth to the second century B.C. These and similar vases show an active trade and artistic intercourse between Apulia and Egypt and Crete. (R. PAGEN- STECHER, Arch. Anz. 1909, cols. 1-18; pl.; 4 figs.) Faliscan Vases.- In the Reimers collection at Hamburg are some forty or fifty Faliscan vases, many of them in black glaze with incised decoration in imitation of metal work. Whole figures are here common, and several features suggest the influence of Cretan-Cyprian or Phoenician metal ware. A curious cantharus with handles remotely resembling mourning figures and with two Pyrrhic dancers in the incised ornament is reproduced. One of the undecorated pithoi bears a graffito identical with that on a Capena olla, which is interpreted as Sex [tus] Sent [ius] or Sex [ti] Sent[i]. (R. BALL- HEIMER, Arch. Anz. 1909, cols. 19-29; 3 figs.) Arretine Moulds in New York. - In B. ]letr. Mus. IV, 1909, pp. 124- 130 (5 figs.), E. R. describes the three Arretine moulds acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1908 (see A.J.A. XIII, p. 375). One is a cover, 19.6 cm. in diameter, decorated with four masks of satyrs and festoons of grapevine. The other two are very beautiful moulds for bowls, one (22.2 cm. in diameter) adorned on each side with two winged maidens approaching an altar; the other (22.5 cm. in diameter) with a banquet scene. The writer also publishes the remarkable gold ear-ring in the form of a siren of the early part of the fifth century, and the three Tanagra statuettes, also acquired in 1908. Of the latter the most interesting (24.6 cm. high) represents a boy seated on a rock, and holding a small jug in his right hand.</page><page sequence="35">ITAL.

The inscription dates from about 200 B.c. The writer also discusses at length the Lepontian inscriptions, which are chiefly proper names. He concludes that the language was Ligurian strongly influenced by Celtic from at least 250 B.c. on. The Syrian Sanctuary of the Lucus Furrinae. --In Mel. Arch. Hist. XXIX, 1909, pp. 239-268 (3 figs.), P. GAUCKLER discusses the inscriptions found during the recent excavations and at previous times in the sanctuary of the Lucus Furrinae.on the Janiculum, and concludes that the sanctuary was sacred to the Heliopolitan couple Jupiter Heliopolitanus and Venus Caelestis, with whom the Sun-god was associated, forming a triad. An Inscribed Fibula. - In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 49-54 (2 figs.), E. BRIZIO publishes a bronze fibula, found at Petrignano in the province of Parma a few years ago, bearing the word AVCISSA. He records seven- teen others, and a possible eighteenth, so inscribed. The name is that of the maker, who probably lived in the second century A.D. The Dacian Iron Works. - In Kio, IX, 1909, pp. 375-376, G. TfGLAS publishes an inscription of the time of Caracalla found at Als6 Telek, 8 km. south of Vajdahunyad in 1903, and of interest in connection with the administration of the Dacian iron works. It reads Numini ) Domini n(ostri) .M1. Aur.

Latin Inscriptions in Geneva. - In M. Inst. Gen. XIX, 1909, pp. 151- 361 (168 figs.), E. DUNANT publishes in facsimile with transliteration and comment 92 Latin inscriptions in the Epigraphical Museum at Geneva; also 52 architectural fragments and pieces of sculpture in the same collec- tion. In Eranos, IX, 1909, pp. 129-136, V. LUNDSTROM discusses ten of the inscriptions. An Epigraphic Manuscript of Foucault. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1909, pp. 269-277, M. BESNIER shows that one of the two manuscripts containing Latin inscriptions lent by Nicholas Foucault to Graevius in 1701 is in the library of the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. Epigraphic Bulletin.- In their review of epigraphic publications relating to Roman antiquity for January-April, 1909 (R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 436-456), RI. CAGNAT and M. BESNIER give the text of 90 inscriptions (13 of which are in Greek) and notes on publications relating to epigraphy. ibid. XIV, 1909, pp. 319-332, the review for May-August, contains the text of 145 inscriptions (three of which are Greek), with notes as before.</page><page sequence="36">240 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 COINS The Decadrachms of Agrigentum. - In Le Muse'e, VI, 1909, pp. 177- 180 (fig.), E. J. SELTMAN argues that all the known decadrachms of Agri- gentum except the one at Munich are forgeries. The position in which the reins are held is a sufficient proof of its genuineness (see A. J. Num. XLIII, pp. 160-163; fig.). Tarentine Coins of HIannibals Time.- The find of 114 coins in mint state struck at Tarentum during the Hannibalic occupation (ca. 212- 209 B.c.) has already been described by AURELIO BELLENI in Boll. Num. VII, pp. 65-69 (cf. A.J.A. XIII, p. 515). It is further treated by M. P. VLASTO in Num. Chron. 1909, pp. 253-263, who acquired some of the coins, which he reproduces in a fine plate. He differs from BELLENI in believing the standard adopted to be that of the (reduced) Roman denarius, rather than of the Corinthian drachmra. The Copper Coinage of Sosius, Proculeius, and Crassus. - In J. Int. Arch. Numn. XI, 1908 (published 1909), pp. 215-229 (pl.), M. BAHRFELDT discusses the copper coinage of Sosius, Proculeius, and Crassus dating from the end of the Roman republic. Senatorial Medallions. - In R. Ital. Num. 1909, pp. 343-364 (5 pls.), FRANCESCo GNECCHI, convinced by the arguments of CAMILLO SERAFINI, in an article read before the Accademia Pontificia Romana, February 28, 1895, retracts his former views concerning a classification of " senatorial medallions," expressed in R. Ital. Num. 1892, and proposes to apply that term to the coins of the empire, having otherwise the characteristics of medallions, which bear the letters S. C. Such issues are much rarer than the "imperial medallions" (without the S. C.), and begin before them (with Vespasian, so far as at present known, the " imperial" beginning with Hadrian). A description of all known types (38) of the larger size (the latest is of Maximian), accompanied by plates, is appended to the article. Proconsulship of C. Asinius Pollio. - The proconsulship in Asia of C: Asinius Pollio is assigned by G. PANSA, on the basis of arguments from his coinage, to the period between 23 and 30 B.c. The author shows that such coinage of the Asiatic cities, where the name of the proconsul appears in the dative, is commemorative merely of a former governor, the name of a ruling governor being given in the genitive with iT'I (Riv. Ital. Num. 1909, pp. 365-378; ill.). Alexandrian Coinage of Galba. - In Num. Chron. 1909, pp. 274-2854 (ill.), J. G. MILNE describes the four different issues of billon tetradrachms from the mint at Alexandria during the reign of Galba. The reverse types are only five in number, which, with the varying obverses, make 24 separate coins, plus two varieties. The author had examined ten hoards (from 120 to about 280 A.D.), containing specimens of this coinage, the total number of pieces being 228. The Iseum Campense on a Coin of Vespasian. - In Sitzb. Berl. Akcad. 1909, pp. 640-648 (pl.), H. DRESSEL discusses the representation on a rare coin of Vespasian (Cohen, Descr. hist. des monnaies frappe'es sous l'Empire romain, 2d ed. I, p. 405, Nos. 484, 485), in which he recognizes the temple of Isis in the Campus Martius. The front of the peribolus, a structure with Corinthian columns and a semicircular gable, is represented, and within is</page><page sequence="37">ITAL.

The inter- pretation is supported by Josephus (Bell. Jud. VII, 5, 4) and Cassius Dio (79, 10). Medallions on Military Ensigns. - GIOVANNI PANSA publishes in Boll. Num. VII, 1909, pp. 145-147, 159-165 (fig.), a bordered medallion of Marcus Aurelius acquired from a private collection in Rome, and still insists, as against FR. GNECCHI, that all the bordered medallions without exception served the sole purpose of decorations of military standards (cf. A.J.A. XII, p. 241; XIII, p. 225). The Temple of Cybele. - Numismatic material of the Antonine age, bearing on the temple of Cybele on the Palatine, is discussed by KATHARINE ESDAILE in Rinz. Mitt. XXIII, 1908, pp. 368-374 (pl.). Distribution of the Coinage of Alexander Severus. - In J. Int. Arch. Num. X, 1907 (published 1909), pp. 311-332, W. THIELE publishes a list of places where coins of Alexander Severus were struck, bringing Cohen's list (IV, pp. 476 ff.) up to date. The head of the emperor always appears in the same form in the provinces from 218 to 263 wherever the coin was struck. Fulvia Plautiana Sebaste.-In Mb. Num. Ges. Wien, VIII, 1909, pp. 117-119, JOSEPH SCIIOLZ argues on the basis of numismatic evidence for the recognition of this Plautiana as a historical personage, although otherwise unknown, and against her identification with the empress Plautilla. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Civilization of the Nuraghi of Sardinia. - In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVIII, 1909, pp. 3-48 and 87-117 (8 figs.), E. PAls, after briefly discussing the uses to which the three or four thousand circular stone structures known as nuraghi were put, combats the tendency to connect them, as well as almost all other archaic finds, with Crete, for he thinks that explorations in Syria and Asia Minor may at any time upset prevailing theories. He disbelieves the stories of Greek writers connecting these remains with Heracles, the Theban Iolaus, and Daedalus, and refuses also to recognize Sardinians in the Shardana who invaded Egypt in the nineteenth dynasty, insisting that the Sardinians were never a sea-power. He is inclined to think that Tyrian influence coming directly by sea or through Carthage and Spain may be recognized in these monuments of the Nori. They were used probably as fortified abodes (not as tombs, as Pinza still thinks), and are often found grouped together in large settlements. Pais compares them with the Apulian Casedde or Truddi, which are, however, not so massively built. Many of the finds near them, arms, utensils of copper, statuettes of shep- herds, priests, soldiers, boats surmounted by a cow's head, suggest a con- nection with Etruria, and point to an epoch immediately preceding historic times, or even to the time of Punic greatness. Taramelli puts them between the end of the third and beginning of the second millennium B.c. Some specimens of writing are reproduced, as also a trophy (?) formed of three spears inserted in a mass of copper. In the second article some sociological inferences are drawn and the way pointed out to a more careful study based on the life of the Sardinians of to-day. The systematic arrangement of nuraghi about an elevated pasture district, Giara di Gesturi, in the province</page><page sequence="38">242 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 of Cagliari, so as to protect the roads and springs and the cultivated fields on the surrounding slopes, has been examined by A. TARAMELLI (A rch. A nz. 1909, cols. 136-139; fig.), and this, together with the details of the struc- tures themselves, strongly fortified dwellings, gives a fairly clear picture of the life of the pre-Phoenician inhabitants. In the archaic period the coast regions presented a species of mixed civilization. In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 18-48 (33 figs.), D. MACKENZIE examines the relation of nuraghi and Giant's Tombs in various parts of Sardinia. The nuraghi of Lo, Calameira, Massonibroccos, Noedda, Ulei, Praidis, Gennacili, Su Chiai, Serucci, Imber- tighe, and San Gavino are discussed in connection with the Giant's Tombs at Santu Luisu, Fontana Morta, Ispiluncas, Noedda, Camposorige, Ludueira, Campo Selenes, Su Chiai, Isarus, Imbertighe, and San Gavino. (See A.J.A. XII, pp. 470-471; XIII, pp. 221 and 510.) Prehistoric Remains at Matera.-- In Annals of Archaeology and An- thropology, II, 1909, pp. 72-90 (4 pls.; 2 figs.), T. E. PEET points out the importance of the prehistoric remains in the vicinity of Matera in southern Italy. They date from neolithic times and later. He divides the pottery into seven classes. The Etruscan Civilization of Felsina.- In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVIII, 1909, pp. 192-223 (5 figs.), P. D)UCATI reviews the contents of two Etruscan graves of the early fifth century B.c., found near Bologna and excavated, the one by Von Duhn and the other by Brizio, in order to conm- pare three burial urns found in 1896 beyond Porta S. Isaia. He concludes that the latter, for topographical reasons, are the earlier, and justify placing the descent of the Etruscans into the region of Bologna in the decades fol- lowing the middle of the sixth century. The article discusses at length the differences in manner of growth of the Italian and Etruscan necropoleis and the encroachment in the latter of the Italian custom of burning the dead instead of burying them. Attic vases, Ducati thinks, found their way into Felsina by way of Adria, not, as Helbig supposes, via Sicily. The acropolis of Felsina he places on a hill between Porta Saragozza ald the Aposa. The Different Races in Sicily.- In R. Stor. Ant. XII, 1909, pp. 459-482, V. COSTAN'ZI argues that the ancient writers Thucydides, Antiochus of Syracuse, etc., depended upon legends in their statements about the different races in Sicily. There was no racial difference between the Sicanianrs and the Sicels, as is shown by archaeological discoveries; but there was such a difference between the neolithic and eneolithic civilizations. The neolithic inhabitants were non-Aryan and non-Italic; those of the Bronze Age Italian invaders. He suggests that the Elymi were the autochthonous inhabit- ants driven to the west end of the island by the arrival of Sicanian-Sicel invaders. There is as yet no satisfactory evidence that prehistoric Cretans invaded Sicily. The tradition of a difference between Sicanians and Sicels probably arose from geographical distinctions and from the fact that the Sicels about Syracuse fell under the influence of the Greeks, and the Sicani- ans about Agrigentumn under that of the Carthaginians. The City of Servius. - In Cl. Phil. IV, 1908, pp. 420-432, E. T. MERRILL discusses 'The City of Servius and the Pomerium,' and maintains that the city of Servius Tullius is not identical with that enclosed by the existing fourth century 'Servian Wall,' and did not enclose the Aventine. The pomeriumn consequently did not enclose the Aventine till the time of Claudius,</page><page sequence="39">ITAL. MISc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 243 though strategical necessity brought about its inclusion within the existing ring-wall. The Beginnings of the Forum Boarium. - In Me'l. Arch. Hist. XXIX, 1909, pp. 103-144 (plan), A. PIGANIOL revives the theory of Bunsen and Urlichs that the Servian wall connected the Capitol and the Aventine and did not descend to the Tiber. The porta Carmentalis was then south of the Capitol at the end of the vicus Jugarius, the porta Trigemina was between the Aventine and Sta. Maria in Cosmedin, and the Forum Boarium was almost entirely outside of the wall. The ruins under and behind Sta. Maria in Cosmedin are those of the Ara Maxima, and the round temnple (Sta. Maria del Sole) is that of Hercules. The harbor (portus Tiberinus) was where the Forum Boarium reached the river. The temples of Fortuna and Mater Matuta were not far fromnt the Piazza Sta. Maria della Consola- zione. The position of the western gates in the Servian wall and several other topographical details are discussed. The Via Salaria.-- In Ribm. Mitt. XXIII, 1908, pp. 275-329 (12 figs.), N. PERSICHIETTI presents the results of fresh studies of the Via Salaria, which he is convinced has many remains of pre-Roman construction. He gives special attention to those sections of the road in the imnmediate vicinity of the city, and near Rieti. The Domus Aurea in the Topographical Documents of Mediaeval Rome.- In Rend. Acc. Lincei, XVIII, 1909, pp. 224-230, A. BARTOLI, dis- cussing Tabularium S. Mariae Novae ab anno 982 ad annum 1200 (Arch. Stor. Parr. XXIII-XXVI), identifies the following: Domnus Nova with the Basilica of Constantine; Trivio Cambiatoris, as near tile corner of the Thermae of Titus; via publica with via del Colosseo; ortuo de eccl. S. M. Nove with the rear portion of S. Maria Nova; Templumn Romuli with the Temple of Venus and Rome; in Quatronis with piazza del Colosseo. The Obelisk in the Piazza Navona. - The hieroglyphics of Domitian's obelisk, in the Piazza Navona, are transcribed and interpreted by G. FARINA in B. Com. Romn. XXXVI, 1908, pp. 254-274. The now sadly damaged obelisk, brought to its present position in 1649, was probably first erected near the Temple of Isis. In its inscription the emperor bears the titles of a Pharaoh. The Barberini Collection of Antiquities from Praeneste. - In Bol. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 161-211 (2 pls.; 34 figs.), A. DELLA SETA discusses the more important objects in the Barberini collection of antiquities from Praeneste now in the museum of the Villa Giulia, Rome. They are of gold, silver, bronze, and ivory, and are to be dated either in the seventh century B.C. or in the third or second century. The Chariot from Monteleone.-In Jh. Oest. Arch. L XII, 1909, pp. 74-80 (3 figs.), P. DUCATI argues that the three reliefs on the front and sides of the chariot from Monteleone, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, represent three episodes in the career of Achilles. In the centre Thetis is presenting Achilles with his arms; on the right is his battle with Memnon over the body of Antilochus; and on the left his departure for the Islands of the Blest. Primitive Bronze Disks. - In Le Muse'e, VI, 1909, pp. 209-213 (4 figs.), A. SAMBON discusses the early bronze disks ornamented with fantastic figures of animals found in central Italy. They were probably attached to</page><page sequence="40">244 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 a background of leather, but the use to which they were put can only be conjectured. Three specimens are described. The Naples Bronzes.- The Field Museum of Chicago has issued a detailed catalogue of the reproductions of bronzes, etc., in the Naples museum in its possession. It is the work of Professor TARBELL. Each object is carefully described and illustrated and the place of its discovery, where known, and the literature given. There are three hundred entries in all, but no statues or statuettes are included. No such catalogue of the originals exists. (Catalogue of Bronzes, etc., in the Field MIluseum of Natural History. By F. B. Tarbell. Field Museum of Natural History. Publication 130. Anthropological Series, Vol. VII, No. 3. Chicago, 1909; 52 pp.; 82 pls.) The Tablets from Locri Epizephyrii.-In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 136-231 (84 figs.), Q. QUAGLIATI gives an account of the tablets or pinaces found onthe site of Locri Epizephyrii in 1906. They are square in shape, 20-30 cm. long on each side, and 5-10 mm. thick, and are made of a poor clay common in the neighborhood. The designs were stamped on and the tablet then painted. The background is usually blue and the other colors used are red, pink, green, yellow, and white. They date from the end of the sixth century to about 460 B.c. and show the influence of Ionic art. Among the subjects represented are a visit to the tomb; the worship of the heroic dead; the rape of Persephone; also a beardless male figure in a chariot drawn by winged horses holding a female figure in his arms; Hades, Persephone, and Hermes; Hermes alone with winged hat holding a cock; Hermes and Aphrodite; Eros; Demeter; a woman seated before a large chest or basket with raised lid and an infant inside; scenes from daily life; female figures before a tree; small temples, etc. These objects are now in the museum at Tarentum. The deity to whom they were dedicated has not yet been identified. A New Fable.-In Ausonia, III, 1908, pp. 71-78 (pl.; fig.), G. PATRONI publishes the upper part of a Roman grave relief in the museum at Cremona, upon which are a fox and a cock facing each other. Above the fox are the words Salve tu; and above the cock Novi te. A fable not otherwise known was apparently represented on the stone. Latin Palaeography.--A new publication of Latin manuscripts in photographic facsimiles, with brief descriptive text in Latin, has been issued by B. G. Teubner. The facsimiles reproduce twenty-five pages from twenty- two manuscripts (in Bamberg, Berlin, Erlangen, Florence, Madrid, Paris, Vienna, and Wolfenbiittel) in the original size and afford a general view of the different styles of writing to the fifteenth century. The plates are accompanied by a brief description in Latin. The price is low, to encourage introduction in schools. (Palaeographia latina.

The figures show the great exactness of the work. From themn the length of the Drusic foot employed (0.3196 m.) could be deduced if it were not known from other sources. The Date of the Triumphal Arch at Orange.--In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1909, pp. 513-518, S. REINACH shows that the words of Vincentius (fifth century A.D.) in his commentary to the fifteenth Psalm, Unde Aurasicae (sic) in arcu triumphali Massiliense bellum sculpturn habetur, ob signumn victoriae Caesaris, are correct. The arch was erected by the father of Tiberius soon after 46 B.c., to commemorate Caesar's victory over the people of Marseilles. The inscription of Tiberius was added when the latter as emperor in his turn put down a rebellion in Gaul. The Black Gate of Besangon. - In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 254-261 (11 figs.), S. REINACH publishes, with comments, new drawings (by Mr. Spitz of Besangon) of the reliefs of the Porte Noire of Besangon, to supple- ment or replace those given in his Rdpertoire de reliefs (1909), I, pp. 78-82. The Enclosure at Saint-Pierre-en-Chastre. - In M. Soc. Ant. Fr. LXVIII, pp. 160-184 (2 plans; fig.), O. VAUVLLLA argues that the ancient enclosure at Saint-Pierre-en-Chastre (Oise) is the site of an oppidum of the Suessiones. Excavations have brought to light objects dating from the neolithic period and later. Inscriptions from Vendoeuvres-en-Brenne. - In M. Soc. Ant. Fr. LXVIII, 1909, pp. 185-214 (5 figs.), A. HRPON DE VILLEFOSSE discusses two Latin inscriptions found at Vendoeuvres-en-Brenne (Indre), one of which records the erection of buildings and shows the importance of the town in Roman times. The word diribitoria occurs in this inscription. He also publishes a carved block upon which is a seated divinity with stag's horns on his head and a nude boy standing on either side of him. Bas-reliefs of Roman Gaul.-- In his Recueil ge'ne'ral des bas-reliefs de la Gaule romaine, II, Aquitaine (Paris, 1908, Imprimerie Nationale. viii, 478 pp.; 1100 figs. 4to), I. ESP1RANDIEU continues his description of the bas-reliefs of Roman Gaul. A few reliefs earlier than the Roman period and a few pieces of sculpture in the round are included in this volume. Each object is briefly described and usually reproduced, and if it has already been published, its bibliography is added. A Gallo-Roman Symbol of Devotion. - At the temple of the Mont de Sane, of Massigny-les-Vitteaux, of Essarois, of the Seine, and elsewhere statues have been found which represent persons holding offerings. These persons have on the front and back of their bodies large disks supported by bands which pass over the shoulders and round the waist. These were ex- plained by Baudet as bullae. In R. Arch. XIII, 1909, pp. 358-362 (2 figs.), E. ESPERANDIEU explains them as symbols or signs of devotion. The originals were probably of woven material. Roman Frescoes at Sainte-Colombe-les-Vienne. - In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1909, pp. 202-204, A. HARON DE VILLEFOSSE reports that there are remains of thirty-five Roman frescoes at Sainte-Colombe-les-Vienne. Two Ancient Bronzes. - In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1909, pp. 182-187 (2 figs.), A. HERON DE VILLEFOSSE discusses two ancient bronzes in the collection of Charles Mbge at Paris. One represents a panther with left front paw raised and resting on a vase. This was found thirty years ago at Puy-Saint- Martin. The other, found in 1898 at Cerro de Montemrnolin, Spain, and</page><page sequence="42">246 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 published by P. Paris (R. Et. Ac. I, pp. 163-167), is a pair of terrets orna- mented with the figure of a Greek seizing a mounted Amazon by the hair. Astrology in Gaul.- In his Astrologie chez les Gallo-Romains (Bordeaux, 1909, Feret et Fils; Paris, A. Fontemoing 182 pp.; 2 figs. 8vo. 10 fr.), H. DE LA VILLE DE MIERMONT publishes a history of astrology in Gaul from its Graeco-Roman beginnings to the sixth century A.D. The work first appeared in instalments in R. . t A nc. Chemical Analyses of Celtic Coins. - In Z. Ethn. XLI, 1909, pp. 458- 462, R. Forrer of Strassburg presents the results of analyses of various Celtic coins made by, or under the supervision of, C. Virchow. The coins were from various places, chiefly in France and Hungary. BELGIUM Megaliths in Belgium.-- In Bulletin des muse'es royaux &amp; Bruxelles, I, 1908, pp. 52-55 (3 figs.), A. DE LOE gives a brief account of the megaliths at Wdris, Exel, Frasnes, and Baileux in Belgium. A Portrait Head in Brussels.-- In Bulletin des musees royaux S Bru- zelles, I, 1908, pp. 25-26, F. C. discusses a marble portrait head in the museum at Brussels atnd dates it in the fourth century A.D. Egyptian Antiquities in Brussels. - In Bulletin des musees royoux S Bruxelles, 1, 1908, pp. 41-44, 55-56, 65-66, 76-78, and 85-86 (8 figs.), J. CAPART catalogues seventy ac- quisitions from Egypt and de- scribes the more important objects in the collection. GERMANY Primitive Arts. - At the November (1908) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological So- ciety, C. SCHUCHHAIRDT showed how the pottery of northern Europe, of which the mega- lithic graves of northern Ger- many have yielded the oldest examples, was developed from basketwork, perhaps with an intervening stage of baskets stiffened with clay, and that it had its decoration on structural lines, while the vases of south- ern Europe, as far north as the Danube, are ultimately derived from the use of gourds and other hard- shelled fruits as vessels, sometimes with handles and hangers of basket or FIGURE 4. -TERRA-COTTA VESSEL FROM CHIETI.</page><page sequence="43">GREAT BRITAIN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 247 network, and had greater freedom in their decorative schemes. The occasional appearance of basketwork designs as far south as Boeotia is noteworthy. Further, the head ornament of the Trojan treasure and the neck, arm, and belt plates of the Bronze Age in the north are imitations of knotted and sewn string or thread. (Arch. Anz. 1909, cols. 36-37.) Local Archaeology in Southwestern Germany. - In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 290 f., S. R. gives the titles of papers read at the meeting of the archaeological society of southern Germany held at Worms in September, 1909. The papers treated of Roman and pre-Romau remains. Notes on the rich museum at Mainz, the admirably organized museum at Darmstadt, the Prehistoric Museum and the Wallraff-Richartz Museum at Cologne, the museums at Trbives, Luxemburg, and Metz are added, and the restoration of the Saalburg, near Homburg, is highly praised. A Terra-cotta Vessel in the Antiquarium in Berlin. - In Ber. Kunsts. XXX, 1909, cols. 263-269 (fig.), R. ZAHN discusses a shallow terra-cotta vessel in the Antiquarium, Berlin (Fig. 4), probably found at Chieti, the ancient Teate, near the east coast of Italy. It is round, with a handle in the shape of a ramin's head on one side, and is decorated in the centre with a trophy and armor roughly modelled. The trophy mnay commemorate a victory over the Samnites. Two other similar vessels are known, one in Gottingen and the other in Alexandria. It dates from the first century B.c. AUSTRIA-H UN GARY Roman Grave Stelae. - In Jh. Oest. Arch. I. XII, 1909, pp. 224-242 (4 figs.), H. HOFMAN'N publishes four Roman grave stelae found at Walbers- dorf, near idenburg, Hungary. Two of them have half-length portraits of the deceased and his wife above and an epitaph below. Theother two are of the same style except that one of them has a man's head above, and the other the head of a man and a woman. All of them seem to date from the first century A.D. A Pannonian Casket. - A Pannonian casket in the National Museum at Budapest (discovered at Intercisa in 1906) is described and compared with other similar caskets from the Danube and Rhine provinces by R. ENGELMANN in R6m. Mlitt. XXIII, 1908, pp. 349-367 (pl.; 2 figs.). The bronze ornaments, which alone have been preserved, are medallions of Bellerophon, Hercules, etc., and Gorgon heads. They are of the age of Constantine. GREAT BRITAIN The Chronology of the British Bronze Age. - In Archaeologia, LXI, 1908, pp. 97-162 (209 figs.), O. MONTELIUS attempts to establish the chro- nology of the Bronze Age in Great Britain and Ireland, dividing it into five periods as follows: Period I, the Copper Age, from the middle of the third millennium B.C., or earlier, to the middle of the second millennium. PIeriod II, from the beginning of the second millennium to the seventeenth century. Period III, from the seventeenth century to the end of the fifteenth. Period IV, from the end of the fifteenth to the middle of the twelfth century. Period V, from the middle of the twelfth to the end of the ninth century. The Iron Age in Great Britain and Ireland began about 800 B.C.</page><page sequence="44">248 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 The Stone Circles of East Cornwall.--In Archaeologia, LXI, 1908, pp. 1-60 (8 pls.; 6 figs.), H. S. GRAY describes the five stone circles of East Cornwall known as the Stripple Stones, the Trippet Stones, the Leaze Stone Circle, the Fernacre Stone Circle, and the Stannon Stone Circle. Near the last two are numerous hut circles which seem to be contemporary, but no human remains have been found in any of them except a few flint flakes from the Stripple Stones discovered by the excavations of 1905. The posi- tion, size, and condition of every stone in the five circles is recorded. AFRICA The Nybgenii. -- In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1909, pp. 568-579 (map), R. CAGNAT publishes inscriptions which show that the Nvyr/3voi of Ptolemy (IV, 3, 6) were called Nybgenii. Their principal town was Civitas Nybgeniorum, later known as Turris Tamalleni. The Punic Necropolis of Ard el Kheraib.- In Notes et Documents, III, 1909 (84 pp.; 7 pls.; 61 figs.), A. MERLIN and L. DRAPPIER describe the Punic cemetery excavated at Ard el Kheraib, west of the hill of Bordj Djedid, Carthage (see A.J.A. XIII, p. 373). Thle burials were made at the bottom of a shaft, usually from 10 to 15 m. deep, or in a chamber leading from the shaft. The body was generally placed in a coffin of wood, or rarely of stone, but was sometimes cremated. Considerable local pottery, silver jewelry, etc., was found, as well as Punic coins of bronze and one of gold. The necropolis dates between 400 and 300 B.C. and resembles that at Ard el Morali. The contents of the graves throw some light on the influence of Greek civilization on Carthage. The 108 tombs opened are described in detail by Drappier. The Epitaph of the Priestess Han- ni-Ba'al. In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1909, pp. 259-268, E. VASSEL discusses the epitaph of the priestess Hanni-Ba'al from Bordj Djedid, Tunis, briefly men- tioned ibid. 1907, p. 804. The names Bod-Meilgart, Qart-jaton, and Qart-malal lead him to conclude that the Cartha- ginians had a divinity called 'El-qart or Ba'al-qart identical with the Genius of the town; that his name may have been shortened to Qart and thus have become the eponym of Carthage. The Inscription from Ain-Ouassel. --In Klio, IX, 1909, pp. 377-378, A. MERLIN discusses the text of the Latin inscription from Ain-Ouassel. Genseric and the Ship at Mahdia.- In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1909, pp. 205- ?08, F. MARTROYE calls attention to Procopius, De Bello Vandalico, I, 5, where it is related that after the sack of Rome one of the ships of Genseric, which was carrying statues, sank on its way to Carthage. He suggests the possibilitythat this is the ship found off Mahdia.

CHASE give a brief account of the collections in the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, the former describing the paintings, the latter the classical antiquities. A Meleager, an Aphrodite of Hellenistic date, a female head of the fourth century (Fig. 5), one of the archaic bronze tripods (C) published in A.J.A.

EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, AND MEDIAEVAL ART GENERBAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. - In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 42-51, L. PARMENTIER discusses the text of the letter of Constan- tine to Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem concerning the building of the church of the Holy Sepulchre as given by Eusebius, Theodoret, aud others. The nave (Kalppa, also elsewhere oFKoc) was to have a gilded coffered ceiling. At each side was one aisle of two stories. Here also the ceilings were to be gilded. Byzantine Churches in Constantinople.- Under the title 'Une mis- siorn i Constantinople,' 1907-1908, JEAN EBERSOLT (R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 1-41; 5 pls.; 30 figs.) gives the results of his researches in churches at Con- stantinople now converted into mosques. By chance the column of Marcian became accessible, and its base is described. On three sides is a garland encircling a shield on which is a six-branched cross. On the front were two Victories in relief, only one of which is preserved, now much mutilated. The body is well proportioned and full of life, and the drapery is excellent. The Byzantine sculptors of the fifth century were still true to the ancient traditions. The churches described are: a basilica, Mir-Achor-Djami; an octagon, Kutchuk-Aya-Sophia; a church with three conchs, Hodja-Mustafa- Pacha-Djami; and seven cruciform churches, Kalender-Djami, Atik-Mustafa- Pacha-Djami, Gul-Djami, Boudrum-Djami, Kiliss&amp;-Djami, Eski-Imaret-Djami, Fitiyg-Djami. The plans, construction, and decoration are described, with illustrations, and mistakes in previous descriptions are corrected. The Basilicas of St. Cyprian. - In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 188-202, CH. SAUMAGNE discusses the basilicas of St. Cyprian at Carthage. The site of the one in the Ager Sexti, the place of the martyrdom, is not disputed. That of the basilica juxta Piscinas in the A reae MIacrobii has been placed on the Koudiat-Soussou, but topographical considerations render this impos- sible. Its probable site was outside the ancient city, near some springs, by the sea, near the promontory Sidi-Bou-Sajid. There was no third basilica. Four Byzantine Churches in Argolis. --The churches at Plataniti, Chonika, Merbaka, and Areia are published by A. STRUCK in Ath. Mitt, XXXIV, 1909, pp. 189-236 (4 pls.; 9 figs). The three latter belong to the same period, that at Chonica being the earliest. The church at Merbaka is dated in 1148-49 A.D. by a building inscription. Architectural Refinements in Mediaeval Churches. - In The A rchi- tectural Record, XXVI, 1909, pp. 132-139 (5 figs.), C. S. HASTINGS proposes</page><page sequence="46">250 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIV, 1910 a method by which the architectural refinements in mediaeval churches may be tested and accurately measured from photographs with the help of a dividing machine and a comparator. Photographs of the church of St. Ouen at Rouen are used for purposes of illustration. Regulations for the Foundations of Buildings.- In Un formulaire du VIIIe si'cle pour les fondations d'e'difices et de ponts (Paris, 1908, Picard et Fils. 35 pp.), V. MORTET publishes with comment portions of a Latin treatise giving rules for the construction of tile foundations of buildings and bridges. The treatise was first published in Archaeologia (XXXII, pp. 183-244), from a manuscript of the twelfth century, but two earlier manuscripts are known, one of the tenth, and one of the eighth century. The work goes back to some Roman writer on architecture. The Meaning of the Word "Apse."--In Lexicographie arche'ologique (Paris, 1908, Picard et Fils. 9 pp.) V. MORTET shows that the word "apse" (c&lt;~f[, absis) among the Byzantines, as among the Romans, meant a portion of a circle less than half the circumference. In popular speech it may have been used to indicate a semicircle. A Byzantine Coin Amulet.- In J. Int. Arch. Num. X, 1907 (published 1909), pp. 333-334 (fig.), K. M. KONSTANTOPOULOS shows that a small Byzan- tine coin published by N. Froehner (Collection Photiades-pacha, Monnaies byzantines, p. 49), is really an amulet. On the obverse about the head of the deity are the words, A-IOC, A 0IC, AFIOC; and on the reverse V-HA CV AOPIT?, which he interprets'YyLEa[v] ro'ool 8op27aL. Byzantine Seals.-- In J. Int. Arch. Num. X, 1907 (published 1909), pp. 335-366, N. A. VEES publishes the first part of an article on the inter- pretation and classification of Byzantine seals, discussing twenty-nine specimens. Oriental Calligraphy. - In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 71-74, CL1MENT HUART calls attention to the importance of the study of Oriental (Arab) calligraphy in its relation to archaeology. Calligraphic styles have indi- viduality as styles of painting have, and knowledge of calligraphy may aid in assigning works of art to their proper authors and in detecting forged signatures. A Mediaeval Greek Inscription.- A copy of the Greek inscription set up by Antonio le Flamenc in the church of St. George at Carditza in Boeotia, is published by W. MILLER, in J.H.S. XXIX, 1909, pp. 198-201, without transliteration except that of Buchon, which is incorrect, and without trans- lation. The date is said to be fixed by the new copy as 1311, the year of the battle of the Cephissus, from which Antonio was one of the few sur- vivors. The dedication may have been in fulfilment of a vow made before the battle. Steps have been taken to secure the plastered wall on which the inscription is painted. Gold Ornaments from Southern Russia.- In Ber. Kunsts. XXXI, 1909, cols. 21-24 (2 figs.), H. SCHMIDT publishes two inlaid gold ornaments, perhaps originally attached to weapons and now in the Berlin Miseum. They are evidently from southern Russia and date from about 500 A.D.

Peter and Catherine in grisaille), and mentions the following objects in the little-known city museum (Rothes Haus) at TrBves, to which the late F. X. Kraus bequeathed his collection of pictures and objects of art: a Siennese "Virgin and Child" (probably by Matteo di Giovanni), a Cruci- fixion on a gold ground, attributed to Giottino, a realistic marble head of Christ, apparently carved in northern Italy about 1400, and a bas-relief of Socrates and Alcibiades, by Canova. The Conical Buckled-helmets (Spangenhelme) of the Baldenheim Type.--In Z. Ethn. XLI, 1909, pp. 506-507 (fig.), MAX EBERT discusses the many conical helmets of the early Middle Ages, formed by riveting together four triangular pieces of metal, concluding that their archetype was made in the Greek workshops of the Bosporus and Pontus. They offer us very early examples of workmanship in cloisonne. Mediaeval Ivories.- In Gaz. B.-A. II, 1909, pp. 301-323 and 389-403, A. MASKELL publishes articles on 'Sculpture in Ivory at the Beginning of the Christian Era, and in the Byzantine Epoch.' They amount to an argu- ment in favor of a generally later date for monuments of this class than is usually assumed, and greater reserve in the assignment to schools. A Mediaeval Canon of Human Proportions. - The Liber divinorum operum simplicis hominis (Migne, Patrologia Latina, Vol. 197, cols. 741 ff.) contains some remarkable reflections on the proportions of the body which amount to a canon. These passages are quoted in Rep.f. K. XXXII, 1909, pp. 445-446, by I. HERWEGEN. The Origin of Mediaeval Stalactite Ornament.- The source of the mediaeval stalactite ornament is not to be found in Islamic architecture, but is derived from the Roman niche. The columns which stood in front of this were incorporated in the niche, and this being done the problem of turning a corner with such a wall-arcade was solved by projecting the half- dome of the niche from the corner and putting the columns under it. The next step was to take away the columns, leaving the half-dome across the corner as a convenient transition from a quadrate to an octagonal plan. Islamic architecture developed this motif into a spreading fan of successive rows of half-domes or niches, and this is the primitive form of the stalactite ornament. This carried with it the stamp of Roman origin in its use of the Roman shell to decorate the niches. Other mediaeval motifs of Roman origin are the arch-frieze, derived from the old Roman wall arcade by omis- sion of the columns and such zigzag ornament as is found in the Mschatta fagade, which comes by the elimination of columns from a similar wall- arcade with gables instead of archivolts.

Crist. 1909, pp. 71-78, calls attention to an Ethiopian Life of St. Menas, existing in several manuscripts, by which we may unify the conclusions drawn by Kaufmnann from his excavations of the Menas-shrine at Mariout in Egypt. It also furnishes valuable evidence regarding the date of this monument, or collection of monuments, the relation of the camel to Menas, and his iconography.</page><page sequence="48">252 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

Horizontal Curves in Pisa Cathedral. - In Am. Archit. XCVI, 1909, pp. 233-240 (11 figs.), W. H. GOODYEAR discusses the horizontal curves and asymmetries in plan of Pisa cathedral. The Portal-Sculptures on the Florence Cathedral.- FRIDA SCHOTT- MULLER in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. 1909, pp. 291-302, finds that the plastic deco- ration of Arnolfo di Cambio's fagade was not removed or altered by Talenti's restoration, between 1360 and 1420, and that later descriptions, drawings, and other representations are valid as evidence for the identification of Arnolfo's figures over the cathedral doorways. These figures are shown to be: the Madonna statue in the Cathedral Museum, which stood over the main portal; two pairs of angels in private possession in Florence; the Virgin and three mourning apostles from the Dormnitio llariae, which filled the lunette over the right-hand portal, now in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum at Berlin; and the" Reclining Virgin," from the Nativity of the other lateral lunette, now in private possession at Florence. An 'Annunciation' by Berna da Siena.--The frescoes of the New Testament which Berna da Siena painted in the Collegiata of San Gimignano, are mostly impregnated with the style of Duccio, but one of them, the Annunciation, shows strong resemblance to the works of Ambrogio Loren- zetti and Simone Martini. (LISA DE SCHLEGEL, L'Arte, XII, 1909, pp. 204- 207.) S. Restituta at Naples.- A. SORRENTINO in Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 217-233, analyzes the evidence for the date of the basilica of S. Restituta at Naples. He finds that the testimony of the Libri Pontificales, both of the Roman and Neapolitan churches, is authoritative, the latter being found to be based upon actual monuments. From these sources we learn that the basilica was the first church erected at Naples, and that it was built by Con- stantine. This is supported by the classical style of the earlier mosaics in the baptistery. The Epitaph of Pope Pontianus. - The discovery of the epitaph of Pontianus in the crypt of S. Cecilia has put a new face upon the question of the value to be assigned to the monogram VP in such epitaphs. This siglum appears in the epitaph of Fabian in the papal crypt, and is obviously a later addition to the original inscription QABIANOC 0 n i . De Rossi thought that it was inscribed after due process of examination into the merits of the bishop to the title - at the successful conclusion of which he received the title as a martyr vindicatus. This could scarcely be the case with Pontianus, who died in exile in 236, and whose body was brought back from Sardinia at least as late as 238, for after such a lapse of time his title would be unquestioned, and when the epitaph was cut, the epithet "martyr" would have been inscribed at the same time. The " martyr," however, both in the case of this epitaph and that of Fabian, was added later, and as there is nothing to lead us to suppose that it would have been done in the third century, it was doubtless an act of commemoration which occurred after the peace of the church.

The Romanesque Cloister at Cadouin.- In Ml. Soc. Ant. Fr. LXVIII, 1908, pp. 299-323, A. BABUT discusses the romanesque cloister at Cadouin (Perigord). Proportions of French Sculptures of the Twelfth Century.- In R. Arch. XIV, 1909, pp. 75-93 (5 figs.) and pp. 216-249 (6 figs.), JEAN LARAN continues (cf. A.J.A. XII, 1908, p. 250; XIII, 1909, p. 236), and concludes his treatise on proportions in French sculpture of the twelfth century, dis- cussing 'the conditions: the programme and technique.' In general, persons of importance and dignity are taller in proportion to their breadth than others. The heads of large figures are relatively smaller than those of small figures. The third dimension, thickness, cannot be so accurately studied, because Romanesque sculpture is seldom carved completely in the round. Real bas-reliefs are also very rare, sculpture being chiefly architectural, pro- ducing figures attached to buildings. The figures are cut in from the out- side of the flat blocks, apparently without the use of clay models, and this accounts for their flat appearance. There seem to have been no fixed canons or formulae of proportions. In a few cases the work of an individual artist can be distinguished. Five schools (Burgundy, the Ile de France, Provence, Auvergne, Languedoc) are distinguishable, though their limits are not clearly marked. In southern France Gallo-Romnan traditions are preserved; in northern France Byzantine influence is strong. In the second half of the twelfth century these two tendencies neutralize each other, perhaps under the influence of the study of the living model. The study of numerical pro- portions is not the whole of the study of art and may not accomplish all that has been claimed for it by some of its devotees, but it furnishes definite criteria and serves to correct ocular illusions. More closely related groups of proportions are to be posited in (1) n statues by one artist than in n statues by different artists, in (2) n statues of one school than in n statues of dif- ferent schools, in (3) n statues of one period than in n statues of different periods, in (4) n statues of one iconographic r61e than in n statues of differ- ent r6les, in (5) n statues of one monumental rble than in n statues of different r6les, in (6) n statues of one scale than in n statues of different scales. These results are of general application. The Author of the Altar-piece of Saint-Bertin.--In Chron. Arts, July 31, 1909 (reprinted in R. Arch.

He evidently does not believe the pictures are, as has been asserted, so worked over as to be virtually modern, though he appears to think they have been somewhat retouched. GREAT BRITAIN Ludlow Castle.--In Archaeologia, LXI, 1908, pp. 257-328 (7 pls.; 28 figs.), W. I1. ST.

Colored plans showing the age of the different parts accompany the text. The Round Church of the Knights Templars at Temple Bruer. - In Archaeologia, LXI, 1908, pp. 177-198 (3 pls.; 6 figs.), W. H. ST. JOHN HOPE reports upon his excavations at the round church of the Knights Templars at Temple Bruer in Lincolnshire in the spring of 1908. The plan of G. Oliver, based upon excavations carried on in 1832 and 1833, was found to need much correction. These early excavations must have been of a very superficial character. There was no "chamber with an immured skeleton " where Oliver thought he had found one, and the "horrible cavern" where he supposed human beings were burned was an old oven. The ground plan of the church has now been recovered. RENAISSANCE ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS New Rembrandts. - In Z. Bild. K. 1909, pp. 1-8, WV. BODE describes a number of the paintings of Rembrandt that have come to light within the last three years. The most important of these are David presenting the Head of Goliath to Saul, in the Heinemann Gallery at Munich; Portrait of a Man, in the collection of A. de Ridder at Cronberg ; a Portrait of a Woman, in the collection of O. Huldschinsky at Berlin; a Descent from the Cross, belonging to Fr. Kleinberger at Paris; a Study of an Old Man, in the Kappel collection at Berlin; and a Portrait of a Scholar, belonging to L. Koppel of the same city. Diirer's Portraits of Himself. - L. REAU in Gaz. B.-A. II, 1909, pp. 103- 120, discusses the "auto-portraits" of Diirer. The series begins with a drawing in the Albertina at Dresden, with an inscription by the artist himself, telling us that he made the portrait at the age of thirteen. His likeness, when an apprentice in Wolgemut's studio, is preserved to us by a figure which he painted in one of the wings of the Peringsddrffer altar- piece (1487). The Diirer of the IWanderjahre is revealed by the very dramlatic pen-drawing in the library at Erlangen (1492). The portrait in the old Goldschmidt collection, now belonging to M. de Villeroy, is probably the one sent by him to his fiancee Agnes Frey at Nuremberg. In the Prado-portrait we have Italian influence, and in the ideal head at Munich (ca. 1506), we have his features assimilated to Diirer's theoretical male type. After this, his visage appears only as a detail in a picture or drawing, save in one curious drawing at Bremen, depicting him ill and nude, save for a loin-cloth,</page><page sequence="51">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 255 and pointing at a yellow patch on his left side, evidently a sketch sent to some physician to indicate the region affected. ITALY Jacopo dal Casentino.--H. P. HORNE cdntributes to Riista d' Arte, 1909, pp. 95-112, a commentary on Vasari's life of Jacopo dal Casentino. The frescoes on the vault of Or San Michele ascribed to Jacopo by Vasari were painted between 1398 and 1401 and could hardly have been done by Jacopo, who was in his prime in 1339. Moreover, there is documentary and other evidence to show that Vasari has confused Jacopo dal Casentino with the painter Jacopo ILaudini, who lived ca. 1400. Michelangelo's Leda.- L. T. BORDONARO in Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 307-315, traces the history of the Leda which Michelangelo made for Alfonso of Ferrara, and brings out the fact that not only the original went to France, where it was destroyed in the seventeenth century, but also the cartoon, from which a copy was made by Benedetto da Bene. The Leda of the National Gallery may be identical with da Bene's copy. If Michel- angelo's model was an antique Leda, he must have used the latter first in making the Night for the Medici tombs, for the pose is the same as that employed in the Leda. The Head by Michelangelo in the Possession of Aretino. - A letter of Aretino speaks of a clay head of St. Cosmas or Damian by Michelangelo, and A. GOTTSCIIEWSKI shows by the citation of a passage in Vasari's Life of Michelangelo that this was a veritable work by the master, and afterward be- longed to Vasari himself. (M11. f. Kunstw. II, 1909, p. 399.) New Documents on Michelangelo and his Time. - K. FREY, in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. 1909 (Beiheft), pp. 103-180, adds a third installment to his 'Studien zu Michelagniolo Buonarroti und zur Kunst seiner Zeit,' the first two parts of which appeared in the same periodical for 1885 and 1895. The present article contains a vast number of new documentary evidences relating particularly to the David, the twelve marble statues for Florence cathedral, the Sala del Consiglio Grande, and the building of St. Peter's. Sebastiano del Piombo and the "' Stanze di Raffaello." - M. WACK- ERNAGEL finds that the group on the right of the Miracle at Bolsena shows the coloring of a Venetian hand, and thinks that Sebastiano del Piombo was Raphael's assistant here, and also in the Decretals.

FRIzzoNI, who undertakes in Rass. d' Arte, IX, 1909, pp. 127-132, to reconstruct his artistic personality. His name is unknown, and his works are often confused with those of Boccac- cio Boccaccino of Cremona. He assigns to him the Madonna in the Crespi gallery at Milan; the Holy Family in the Fontana collection at Turin; a Portrait of a Girl belonging to the Del Majno family in Milan; the Zin- garella in the Pitti; an Adoration of the Shepherds belonging to Dr. Miiller-Walde; an Adoration of the Magi in the Brera; the Madonna with St. Sebastian in the Pinacotheca Estense at Modena; Sts. Mary and Martha in the Verona gallery; and a Madonna with an Angel in the Cagnola col- lection at Milan.</page><page sequence="52">256 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 A Melozzo Controversy.--In Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 281-287, G. CANTALAMESSA gives a new and accurate reproduction (Fig. 6) of the Annun- ciation recently discovered in the Pantheon (see A.J.A. 1909, p. 529) and assigned to Antoniazzo Romano, from which it appears that the work is an excellent example of Melozzo da Forli. lIe supports the new attribution by comparison of various details with other works of Melozzo. In like manner the St. Sebastian with donors recently acquired by the National (Corsini) Gallery at Rome, which has been assigned to Antoniazzo Romano by Jacobsen and also by Everett (see A. J.A. 1907, p. 296), is defended as a work of Melozzo's by LISA VON SCHLEGEL in L' Arte, XII, 1909, pp. 307-313. A. SCHMAItSOW, on the other hand, writing in Mh.f. Kunstw. II, 1909, pp. 497-503, rejects both of these attributions. The Pantheon fresco he assigns to Antoniazzo, and argues that the resemblances to Melozzo's style in the St. Sebastian are to be explained by assuming that Melozzo commenced the figure of the saint, which was finished together with the donors, after his departure from Rome, by Antoniazzo. The portrait in the Faenza in which Antonio Mufioz recently attempted to trace the hand of Melozzo is assigned by Schmarsow to some eclectic combining the Venetian style of Bellini and the local art of the Romagna. The same milieu produced the two paintings which Corrado Ricci recently added to the Uffizi under the name of Melozzo. In Rass. dc' Arte, IX, 1909, October, pp. iii-iv, G. BERNARDINI defends his original attribution of the Pantheon Annunciation and the St. Sebastian to Antoniazzo. M. PERNOT, in Chron. Arts, 1909, pp. 248-249, considers the Pantheon fresco too good for Antoniazzo, but expresses some doubts as to the possibility of assigning it to Melozzo. Federigo Barocci.--In Abh. Sdichs. Ges. XXVI (No. 4), 1909 (168 pp.; 13 pls.), AuvGusT SCHMARSOW discusses the development and the works of Federigo Barocci of Urbino (apparently 1526-1612). He finds that he was an artist of great individuality and originality, by no means a mere imitator or mannerist. He stands between Michael Angelo and Rubens in thehistory of the development of the barock style. Ibid. No. 5 (40 pp.), the same author describes and discusses Barocci's drawings in the Uffizi at Florence. Benedetto Bonfigli.-- W. BOMBE in Rep. f. K. XXXII, 1909, pp. 231-246, finishes his monograph on the Umbrian artist Benedetto Bonfigli. He was closely wrapped up in Sienese art at the beginning of his career. Naturalism and perspective he learned from Domenico Veneziano, Piero della Francesca, and Filippo Lippi. He was probably in Rome about 1450 and there doubtless met Fra Angelico, whose influence, together with that of Benozzo Gozzoli, is manifest in his later works. Another characteristic of his later period is the change from a light to a darker, brownish color- scheme. He was the last of the old Umbrian school, unable to keep step with the new art introduced by Fiorenzo and Perugino. The Sienesque in Umbrian Painting. - In L' A rte, XII, 1909, pp. 188-202, A. VENTURI undertakes to show the strong influence of Siena on the Umbrian quattrocentists, and to analyze the artistic development of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. Giovanni Boccati del Camerino was the follower of neither Filippo Lippi, Gozzoli, Piero della Francesca, Gentile da Fabriano, nor Domenico Veneziano, but drew almost entirely from the Sienese Domenico di Bartolo. In the same way Sano di Pietro was the inspiration</page><page sequence="53">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 257 FIGURE 6. - ANNUNCIATION IN THE PANTHEON.</page><page sequence="54">258 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 of Matteo da Gualdo. A similar coincidence is manifest between the works of Niccolk Alunno and Matteo di Giovanni, but both derived their fantastic details from the Venetians. Benedetto Bonfigli again had little to do with the Florentines, and most of his peculiarities can be paralleled in the Sienese. Sienese influence, drawn through the medium of Niccolb Alunmno and Bonfigli, was the determining factor of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo's art. He had scarcely attained to a manner of his own, when Perugino's art attracted him and his later works are unsuccessful attempts to assimilate the breadth and grandeur of the greater master. The Holy Family in Gemona. - A document of 1510 records a con- tract of the Confraternity of St. Leonard in Gemona with the painter Gianfrancesco da Tolmezzo to paint for themn an altar-piece "better than the St. Joseph he painted for S. Maria delle Grazie," from which it would be supposed that the Holy Family and St. Elizabeth, the only picture answer- ing to this description which exists in S. Maria delle Grazie, must be by the hand of Gianfrancesco. But his known pictures are Squarcionesque, and it has been suggested that the original picture is gone and that the existing one is a substitution. L. VENTURI in L' Arte, XII, 1909, pp. 211-215, argues that the evidence of the document holds, and that the known pictures by the painter represent his earlier period, while the Gemona Holy Family belongs to his later work under the influence of the Vicentine school. The New Pinacoteca Vaticana. - The most important pictures, from the historical point of view, which form part of the new Pinacoteca Vati- cana, are discussed by G. BERNARDINI in Rass. d' Arte, IX, 1909, pp. 89-94 and 113-120. The gallery is interesting chiefly for the following early pictures: a Crucifixion and Saints of the school of Giotto; a Madonna, by Bernardo Daddi; a Virgin and Saints, by Giovanni del Biondo; a Legend of St. Stephen, one of a series of eight fragments of a predella, by a Sienese Giot- tesque; a Madonna and Female Saints, and a Christ before Pilate, by Pietro Lorenzetti; a Crucifixion, by a follower of Lippo Memmi; a Nativity, by Giovanni di Paolo; and a Miracle of St. Nicholas, by Gentile da Fabriano. Attributions in the Querini Stampalia Gallery at Venice.- The second of E. JACOBSEN'S articles on the Querini Stampalia pictures appears in Gaz. B.-A. II, 1909, pp. 216-236. In the course of this, he assigns the Judith, catalogued as Palma Vecchio, to Catena, quoting the description of a similar picture by Catena in Ridolfi's Meraviglie dell' arte. The Virgin adoring the Child, catalogued as of the Lombard schlool, is a certain work of Lorenzo di Credi. The Santa Conversazione, ascribed to Titian's school, is by Beccaruzzi. The unfinished portrait of a young woman probably represents Paola Priuli, the bride of Francesco Queriii, and was painted by Palma Vecchio. The companion piece to this picture is the male portrait in the same gallery, which is sometimes assigned to Giorgione, but is to be considered the portrait of Francesco Querini, done by Palma. The article terminates with an argument in favor of giving to Palma Vecchio the Tem- pest calmed by St. Mark, which has also been attributed to Giorgione. Attributions in the Palermo Gallery.--C. MATRANGA contributes to Boll. Arte, III, 1909, pp. 340-351, a discussion of the authorship of certain pictures in this gallery. The Pentecost, attributed to Perugino at first and by Di Marzo to Pietro Ruzzolone, is the work of an unknown cinquecento painter of the Messina school, who was also the author of the Dispute of St.</page><page sequence="55">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 259 Thomas Aquinas and a number of other works. The recently acquired IMadonna with Sts. Leonard and Roch belongs to the work of Vincenzo di Pavia, of which the museum possesses other examples. A Catalogue of Tuscan Statuettes. - C. voN FABRICZY publishes in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. 1909 (Beiheft), pp. 1-85, a catalogue raisonni of the terra- cotta and wood statuettes of Tuscany from 1300 to the early cinquecento. The catalogue is arranged according to the three schools of Pisa, Florence, and Siena, and within these divisions the statuettes are given according to their present location. The catalogue is followed by an index of artists. Three Reliefs by Sansovino. - Three bronze reliefs each representing Christ in glory, sustained together with His cross by putti, and all ascribed to Sansovino, are the subject of an article by G. LORENZETTI in L' A rte, XII, 1909, pp. 288-301. One is on the door of the ciborium of the altar of St. Anthony in St. Mark's at Venice, another in the Bargello, and the third in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum at Berlin. While the first two are indubi- tably Sansovino's work, the third is believed by the author to be an imita- tion of the sculptor's model by one of his contemporaries or an artist of somewhat later date. The Tomb of Paul III in St. Peter's.- K. ESCHER traces the history of the tomb of Paul III in St. Peter's in Rep. f. K. XXXII, 1909, pp. 302- 320. Fra Guglielmo della Porta received the commission in 1550 from Car- dinal Alessandro Farnese. His original design was for a free-standing monument, and consisted of a great stone block with a chamber for the sarcophagus, two bronze cenotaphs, four allegorical figures of marble, four corner-statues, and eight termini. The upper part consisted of a bronze base with reliefs, and the colossal statue of the Pope. Then followed proposals of reductions of various kinds through the intervention of Paciotto, Michelan- gelo, and Annibale Caro, and Michelangelo finally succeeded in having the tomb set up in the niche of St. Andrew, which necessitated the reduction of the allegories to half their number. When finally inaugurated in 1585, it retained only the four corner-figures, the sculptured bronze base, the colos- sal statue, and the four allegories. In 1628, Urban VIII transported the monument to the left niche of the choir-tribunal, at which time the statues of Abundance and Peace, the bronze vase, and two corner-figures were removed. A Letter of Benvenuto Cellini. - In Me'l. Arch. Hist. XXIX, 1909, pp. 225-232, C. CocHIN publishes and comments upon a letter written Novem- ber 18, 1553, by Benvenuto Cellini to Bernardo Salviati, bishop of San Papolo in Venice. In this Benvenuto describes a salt-cellar he had made. It was of oval form, supported by four children, and on the cover was Venus with Cupid asleep on her breast. Probably this is the salt-cellar begun for Cardinal Salviati, in part payment for which Benvenuto received 100 crowns in 1549 from the Cardinal of Ravenna. The Farnese Palace in 1653.-In Mell. Arch. Hist. XXIX, 1909, pp. 145-198 (5 pls.), P. BOURDON and R. LAURENT-VIBERT give an account of the palazzo Farnese and its contents as described in two manuscripts now in the Archivio di Stato at Parma. These are inventories which belonged in the eighteenth century to Moreau de St. M6ry. They were drawn up by B. Faini, April 1st, 1653.</page><page sequence="56">260 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIV, 1910 SPAIN Philippe de Bourgogne. - Philippe de Bourgogne was a sculptor of French origin, whose career was in Spain. Shortly after 1502 he carved the retable in the royal chapel at Granada. He made the choir-stalls of Burgos between 1507 and 1512. In 1536 he undertook the sculptures of the choir of Burgos cathedral, and after completing these, was commissioned to plan and decorate the new transept. The stalls of Toledo were undertaken in 1540, aiid are signed both ky Philippe and by Berruguete. (P. LAFOND, Burl. Mag. XV, 1909, pp. 285-297.) FRANCE Franciscan Iconography in France. - An article by E. BERTAUX in Gaz. B.-A. II, 1909, pp. 135-162, takes the form of a review of E. Male's L'Art religieux de la fin du Moyen Aige en France, and disagrees with the latter's thesis in one important particular. Bertaux agrees with Male that the transformation in Christian iconography which had been completed by the beginning of the fifteenth century had its ultimate origin in the apocry- phal "Lives of Jesus and Mary," which issued from Franciscan sources, and that these writings also inspired the "Mysteries" of the fourteenth century; but he shows that the earlier changes in the representations of the Pas- sion in French art were directly borrowed from Italy, and not from the "Mysteries." The "Hours" of Anne of Brittany. - In Gaz. B.-A. II, 1909, pp. 177- 196, F. DE MfILY attacks the attribution of the miniatures of the book of Hours of Anne of Brittany to Jean Bourdichon, basing his argument chiefly on inequalities in the style, an entry in the accounts of the queen, which notes the payment of Jean Poyet for a manuscript of about the same number of miniatures, and the signature P, on the first miniature, which he regards as a Grecized monogram for I[ehan] P[oyet]. GERMANY The Saint-Bertin Altar-piece.- Two wings of the Saint-Bertin altar- piece now in the Berlin Gallery have been attributed to Memling and again to Simon M~armion. From documentary evidence, as well as the resem- blance of the pictures to certain miniatures in the Education of the Prince, the manuscript No. 5104 in the Library of the Arsenal, P. DURRIEU con- cludes that the Berlin panels must be assigned to Jean Hennecart, who is undoubtedly the author of the miniatures. (Chron. Arts, 1909, pp. 216-218.) Meister Hans Seyfer of Heilbronn.- A reconstruction of the life and work of Meister Hans Seyfer of Heilbronn (d. 1509), the author of the famous group (now destroyed), of the Mount of Olives at Speyer, and now recognized to be the creator of the high altar in the Kilians-kirche at Heilbronn, is given by M. voN RAUCH in MAh.f. Kunstw. If, 1909, pp. 503-528. Benedict Dreyer. - Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. 1909, pp. 271-281, contains a risumd of the work of Benedict Dreyer, a wood-sculptor of Liibeck in the early sixteenth century, with a catalogue of his works. The Chronology of Griinewald. - H. A. SCHMID tabulates the principal works of Griinewald in chronological order as follows: 1505, The Crucifixion</page><page sequence="57">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 261 in Basel; ca. 1509, the Frankfort pictures and the altar-piece in Colmar; in his later period, the altar in Aschaffenburg, the Madonna in Steppach, and the Freiburg altar-piece wing; ca. 1522, the Crucifixion and Christ bearing the Cross, in Karlsruhe; 1524-1525, the predella in Aschaffenburg, and theMauritius and Erasmus in Munich. The pictures for Mainz cathe- dral seem to have been done in part before 1525. He died about 1529. (Rep.f. K. XXXII, 1909, pp. 412-414.) GREAT BRITAIN A Minerva by Cellini.--A bronze statuette representing Minerva (Fig. 7) is published in Burl. 2Iag. XVI, 1909, pp. 40-49, by F. W. LIPe- FIGURE 7.- MINERVA BY CELLINI. MANN. He assigns it to Benvenuto Cellini on the ground of its resemblance to many of his figures, and particularly to the Minerva on the base of the Perseus monument at Florence. The editor adds a note to Lippmann's arti- cle, pointing out that Cellini was commissioned by Francis I to model twelve silver statues of divinities to serve as candelabra. Only one was completed, but Cellini speaks of having done the wax models for four, Jupiter, Juno,</page><page sequence="58">262 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 Apollo, and Vulcan, and the Minerva may have been modelled at the same time. The statuette is in private possession in London. The Judgment of Solomon. - The Judgment of Solomon, well known since its attribution to Giorgione by Herbert Cook, is assigned to Catena by R. E. FRY in Burl. Mag. XVI, 1909, pp. 6-9, on the ground that the color- scheme and types are identical with those of Catena's works, particularly the Supper at Emmaus at Bergamno, and the Adoration of the Shepherds in Earl Brownlow's collection. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY A Cast in the Smithsonian.- In American Anthropologist, N. S. II, 1909, pp. 348-358, J. WALTER FEWKES discusses the origin of a hitherto undescribed cast in the Smithsonian collections and its identification. The original is No. 12017 in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. It is a human kneeling figure thirteen and a quarter inches in height and carries a peculiar "pedestal" or "canopy" on its head. From the presence of this "canopy" the carving of the face, the form of the ears and their ap- pendages, the enlargements on the arms and the character of the backbone, and for other reasons, the author concludes that its characteristics are those of the Antillean or Tainan culture. It is possible that the "canopy" was a "Tabla," on which were placed offerings for the idol beneath it. The Dance in Hawaii.- In Bulletin 38 of the Bureau of American Eth- nology (288 pp.; 24 pls.; 3 figs.),N. B. EMERSON discusses the unwritten literature of Hawaii and the sacred songs of the hula or dance. It is in gen- eral an extended contribution to our knowledge of Polynesian ethnology. The words and music, the dances, the poses and gestures, the symbolism and the history and traditions of the Hawaiian ceremonies are set forth at length and descriptions given of the musical instruments used. Of interest perhaps to classical archaeologists in music is the paragraph on page 148: "With the assistance of a musical friend it was found that the old Hawaiian tuned his strings with approximate correctness to the tonic, the third and the fifth," and the following comparison that the author makes with the method of tuning proposed by Aristoxenus. Putnam Anniversary Volume. - A volume presented to Professor Fred- erick Ward Putnam, of Harvard University contains the following articles : Pp. 1-42, A. L. KROEBER discusses 'the Archaeology of California,' describ- ing the southwestern, the northwestern, and the central cultures. He establishes two types of comparatively ancient pottery. Pictographs are comparatively rare. The writer believes that man lived in California at a very remote period. - Pp. 43-82, J. WALTER FEWKES discusses 'Ancient Zurii Pottery.' The collection on which the study is based is the Hemnenway Collection in the Peabody Museum in Cambridge. The conclusion reached is " that the ancient culture of the Zufii valley was almost identical with that of the rest of the Little Colorado drainage, implying that the modern Zufli culture contains elements due to acculturation from the north and north- east."-Pp. 83-101, CHARLES C. WILLOUGHBY discusses the 'Pottery of the New England Indians.' He distinguishes three divisions: the archaic Algonquian, the later Algonquian, and the Iroquoian. The antiquity of the first is considerable; the vessels have a pointed base for use in inserting</page><page sequence="59">AMERICAN ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 263 the vase into soft earth; the Iroquoian vessels were furnished with rims suitable for suspension and with rounded bases; the later Algouquian type was a combination of the older and of the Iroquoian. Numerous remains of the Iroquoian type in Vermont in the Champlain drainage basin point to an occupancy of that region by Iroquoian tribes. - Pp. 102-125, WILLIAM C. MILLS discusses the 'Seip Mound.' The group of earthworks of which the Seip Mound is a part is situated in Ross County, Ohio. It was a monument to the dead erected on the site of a charnel house, in which burials were made of cremated bodies. Some uncremated burials of a less carefully prepared type were found at a higher level in the mound. Intertribal trade is shown by the finding of copper from the Lake Superior region, ocean-shells and alligator teeth from the South, and mica from North Carolina. The builders of the mound were pre-Columbian and "belonged to the highest culture of aboriginal man in Ohio." - Pp. 126-136, CHARLES W. MIEAD discusses 'The Fish in Ancient Peruvian Art.' Designs in fish-form occur in all the arts of the prehistoric peoples of Peru, on tex- tiles, pottery, and gourds. They vary from the fairly realistic to the extreme of conventionalism, and occur in various combinations. No historical sequence of conventionalization is attempted. The author says " that the theory of development by degeneration seems the most natural one." - Pp. 137-150, WARREN K. MOOREHEAD contributes a 'Study of Primitive Cul- tures in Ohio.' He distinguishes three cultures: the Glacial Kaime Culture, the Hopewell Culture, and the Fort Ancient Culture. The first belonged to an early people who used the mounds of glacial gravel for burial places; the second was peculiar to a tribe or tribes, possibly of southern origin and brachycephalic and of a sedentary nature; the third is of uncertain origin and belonged to a people with long heads. Both the Hopewell and the Fort Ancient peoples built elaborate earthworks which were probably the result of a long process of development. - Pp. 151- 190, MARSHALL H. SAVILLE discusses 'The Cruciform Structures of Mitla and Vicinity.' He describes the explorations of five cruciformn structures at or near Mitla, Oaxaca, Mexico. Decoration of the walls in mosaics, the pattern of which is formed by projecting stones, is a feature; much of this has been defaced, possibly by the Indians themselves, "who have a belief that stones or fragments taken from the buildings will, sooner or later, turn to gold." The writer connects the form of the cross with the worship of Quetzalcoatl, proving "the widespread range of the Nahuan pantheon." - Pp. 191-195, GEORGE BYRON GORDON discusses ' Convention- alism and Realism in Maya Art at Copan, with Special Reference to the Treatment of the Macaw.' Two figures representing the head and especially the beak of this bird are given; the first, from Stela B, showing a strong tendency to exaggerate, and the other, from the Hieroglyphic Stairway, being a much more successful attempt at realistic portrayal; the stairway represents to the writer an attempt to get away from the trammels of tradi- tion and conventionalism.- Pp. 196-252, GEORGE H. PEPPER discusses the 'Exploration of a Burial-Room in Pueblo Bonito, New Mexico.' Though the primary purpose of this room may not have been that of burial, the amount and value of the jewelry and other objects found with the skeletons point to the rank, probably ecclesiastical, of those buried within the walls. Among the articles found were wooden flageolets, "ceremonial sticks " of</page><page sequence="60">264 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIV, 1910 differing forms, jars and bowls of pottery, and pendants and beads of tur- quoise. Noteworthy is a cylindrical basket, which, as restored (pl. IV, 1), is six inches long, and three inches in diameter, covered with a mosaic of turquoise. The burials discovered date from the highest development of the aesthetic arts of the inhabitants of this famous Pueblo in the Chaco Cafion. - Pp. 253-267, ALICE C. FLETCHER discusses' Tribal Structure: a Study of the Omaha and Cognate Tribes.' Descent in the Omaha gens was traced only through the father; but it was through the mother that the child extended his kinship beyond the gens into that of a great community. - Pp. 268-298, CHARLES P. BOWDITCH discusses 'The Dates and Numbers of Pages 24 and 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex,' and finds that the break in the Dresden Codex is not a necessary assumption, in this differing from the conclusions of Fdrstemann; in certain of the intricate numerical calcula- tions of the calendar system he finds himself at variance with previous results. - Pp. 299-343, ALFRED MARSTON TOZZER discusses the 'Religious Ceremonoials of the Navaho.' The Navaho, according to their own legends, obtained much of their culture from the cliff-dwellers found inhabiting the pueblos now deserted; as the present Pueblo peoples are probably descended from those cliff-dwellers, the culture of the extant pueblos is an inheritance, while that of the Navaho must be considered in some part a borrowing. After the first borrowing, however, the Navaho showed great originality in development; this is especially seen in the famous sand paintings where all, except the bare idea of making pictures in different colored sand, was their own.-Pp. 368-384, ZELIA NUTTALL discusses a' Curious Survival in Mexico of the Use of the Purpura Shell-fish for Dyeing.' The writer found at Tehuantepec a survival of the practice of extracting dye from a species of sea-snail allied to the classical murex of the Mediterranean. This adds one more to the list of resemblances between the ancient civilizations of the eastern and western worlds, and the writer sees justification at least for those who prefer the theory of con- tact to the theory of psychic unity for the origin of the higher American civilizations.--Pp. 385-394, PLINY EARLE GODDARD discusses 'Gotal, a Mescalero Apache Ceremony.' An account of this ceremony relating both to female adolescence and to creation-traditions was obtained from Trias, the last priest of the chief rites of the ceremony in 1906. Numerous songs were sung and ceremonies in which pollen plays a large part were accomplished. --Pp. 395-404, S. A. BARRETT discusses 'The Cayapa Numeral System.' The Cayapa Indians of northwestern Ecuador count by using a series of basal numbers; these are 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 100; the last serves also for the thousands.- Pp. 405-426, ALES HRDLI(KA discusses the' Stature of the Indians of the Southwest and of Northern Mexico.' The writer presents statistical information about the stature and also the cephalic indices of many Indian tribes. The statistics do not bear out any theories of the influence of climate on stature; heredity and food-supply appear to be the strongest determining influences. - Pp. 427-460, FRANZ BOAS presents ' Notes on the Iroquois Language.' - Pp. 461-476, ROLAND B. DIXON presents the 'Outlines of Wintun Grammar.' - Pp. 477-486, JOHN R. SWANTON presents a 'New Siouan Dialect.' These are linguistic monographs dealing with three exam- ples of linguistic stocks independent each of the other. They are illustrated with texts and paradigms. -Pp. 487-520, HARLAN I. SMITH discusses'Prim-</page><page sequence="61">AMERICANAc. ARCH. RCAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1909 265 itive Industries as a Normal College Course.' The author describes in detail a course of lectures on the evolution of industries given recently in the Department of Domestic Art in the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. - Pp. 521-544, GEORGE A. I)ORSEY describes 'AVisit to the German Solomon Islands.' Both natives and landscapes of these "Cannibal Islands" are more pleasing than one would naturally expect. The book contains also the following articles not connected with Amleri- can Archaeology: Pp. 344-367, 'Certain Quests and Dates,' by CHARLES PEABODY; pp. 545-566, 'The Pillars of Hercules and Chaucer's " Trophee,"' by G.
