<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLATT (V.) Facing the Gods: Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. Pp. xviii + 482, illus. £79. 9780521861717. doi: 10.101 7/S00754269 1 3000578 Piatt's book contributes to a wealth of recent scholarship on issues of cognition, vision, visuality and ekphrasis, especially with regard to the 'Second Sophistic' (one thinks of work by Jas Eisner, Simon Goldhill, Helen Morales, Ruth Webb, Tim Whitmarsh, etc), and her ways of seeing the evidence are very much shaped by these scholars' enthusiasms and modes of expression. But more insistently than any of their works, Piatt's book also seeks to contribute to the field of Graeco-Roman religion, adopting a special and sustained approach to J. Eisner's 'viewing and the sacred' ( Roman Eyes: Visuality and Subjectivity in Art and Text , Princeton, 2007, 22-26) by focusing on epiphany. She is not the first to realize the importance of epiphany as a phenomenon and a discourse: articles by Richard Gordon ('The real and the imaginary. Production and religion in the Greco-Roman world', Art History 2, 1979, 5-34) and Henk Versnel ('What did ancient man see when he saw a god? Some reflections on Greco- Roman epiphany', in C. van der Plas (ed.), Effigies Dei. Essays on the History of Religions , Leiden, 1987, 42-55) blaze a trail here. But with scholars of Greek religion (for example Julia Kindt in 'Ancient Greece', in T. Insoll (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Ritual and Religion , Oxford, 2011, 696-709 and in Rethinking Greek Religion , Cambridge, 2012) now clamouring for material culture to be better integrated into the field, and the archaeology of the sacred seen as central to the understanding of religious beliefs and practices, Piatt is able to forge ahead. The issue in which she is most inter- ested - the complex relationship between gods and their images - has been well served of late, in part due to her influence (so Robin Osborne and Michael Squire's 2011 books both have chapters</page><page sequence="2">HISTORY 215 on gods' bodies: R. Osborne, The History Written on the Classical Greek Body , Cambridge, 185-215; M. Squire, The Art of the Body: Antiquity and its Legacy , London and New York, 154-201), while Milette Gaifman on aniconism in particular ('Statue, cult and reproduction', Art History 29.2, 2006, 258-79; Aniconism in Greek Antiquity , Oxford, 2012), Anja Klöckner ('Getting in contact. Concepts of human/divine encounter in Classical Greek art', in J.N. Bremmer and A. Erskine (eds), The Gods of Ancient Greece. Identities and Transformations , Edinburgh, 2010, 106-25) and demente Marconi ('The birth of an image: the painting of a statue of Herakles and theories of representation in ancient Greek culture', Res 59/60, 2011, 145-67) have also contributed, but Piatt's decision to bring cult statues together with writing about gods and cult statues, and with relief-sculpture, dream-visions and hymns makes for a unique contribution. This contribution is as much philosophical as it is literary-critical or art-historical and can justifiably be called 'theology'. Piatt plunges straight into ancient debates about the relationship of god and image with a discussion of book 2 of the Elder Philostratus' Imagines - a poem about a painting of an ivory statue of Aphrodite. This opening sets the tone in two important ways. First, the absence of any rehearsal is typical: hers is a book which 'preaches to the converted' rather than attempts to take its highly sophisticated and often intricate exegesis out to a wider flock. Undergraduates will, I fear, find her prose elusive (it takes until n.23, for example, for us to be told which Philostratus' Imagines this is) and her examples relentless, even if the light that each of them throws on what a god is, the problems of anthropomorphism and so on is sufficiently different from the next as to add nuance to the overall argument. Second, this is a book as much about the role that epiphany plays in the revival of Greek culture in the Roman Empire of the second and third centuries AD, when Philostratus was writing, as it is about ancient Greek practice and mentalités. After four chapters exposing the religious, literary and artistic strategies which characterize epiphany in Archaic through to Hellenistic Greece, part 2 revisits this evidence and more to spotlight the ways in which the rise of Hellenic intellectualism under Rome intensified the existing bond between piety and paideia , enabling the image's power as god and not god simultane- ously to body forth a different kind of absence - a reanimation of the past in the present. Part 3 (one chapter) looks at what happens when 'striking appearance' intersects with death or passing away, and the dynamics of epiphany on sarcophagi. Piatt describes her book as 'a history of epiphany'. Though she does offer a sense of evolving imagery and discourse, her emphasis on the mechanics by which artists and authors coped with the impossible conundrum of visualizing god means that the nature of the problem and the exigencies of each case sometimes trump bigger questions of historical change. That Hellenistic poets had a more 'self-conscious' way of doing epiphany and wanted it to do different things is diagnosed as follows: 'In Hellenistic poetry the enargeia that characterised epiphanic encounter in the Homeric corpus; for example, is reformulated as the enargeia of ekphrasis' (173). One is left with a discourse and concept of the divine which is less rooted in the context of the Hellenistic court than earlier sections of the book (on the adoption of the title Epiphanês by Hellenistic dynasts or the monumentalization of Pergamům) might have led us to expect. Woefully conservative it may be to think (only) about how religion maps onto the socio-political landscape of Greece, but like Eisner's 'sacred viewing', Piatt's 'hermeneutics of the sacred' is in danger of sounding too generic for historians of religion. The travels and villa of Hadrian, who is not in the index, are glossed en passant as 'pilgrimage' and as 'a visual experience of theoriď (251-52). Such assumptions are symptomatic of a treatment of Rome as Graeco-Roman. A surprising omission after the discussion of the title Epiphanês are 'divi' and their images. Once Claudius, an emperor renowned for his physical deformity, is given the body and attributes of Jupiter, and Caligula said to dream of the moon goddess, to dress as Jupiter, Neptune and Venus and to want to remove the head from Pheidian Zeus, the challenge to the ontology of god and cult-statue is arguably as big as that presented by Christianity. In the 'Second Sophistic', the statue of 'theos Hadrian' at Pergamům has the body not of a deity but of Kresilas' Diomedes, which again impacts on the epiphany question. Not to incor- porate this material is to limit one's under- standing of Philostratus' and Pausanias' way of seeing the world and the immortals' interaction with it.
