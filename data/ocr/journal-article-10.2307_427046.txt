By the end of the nineteenth century it was apparent in the Occident that the imitation of outward styles was a poor procedure for the fulfillment of cur- rent design needs, whereas-as was pointed out so forcefully by Samuel Bing (originator of Art Nouveau) in France and Frank Lloyd Wright in this country- to make use of the underlying principles of former cultures was a healthy method that could bring about a graceful and sympathetic mode of expression.2 An idea is more flexible and therefore more applicable to any given situation than a fixed form can be; and if we are going to continue to seek inspiration in the plastic arts of the Far East it is better that it be done in the sense of a stimulation for creative activity rather than as a limited model to which we must conform. The appeal in the West of works of art from the Extreme East at the present time is due in large measure to the considerable amount of artistic freedom dis- played in them, combined with a remarkably high degree of sound craftsmanship and genuine good taste. A Chinese chair of the northern or "scholar" type and a medium-sized Japanese dwelling-as typical examples-have a buoyant quality, a simplicity, and excellence of proportions seldom met with conjointly in a European or American house or its furnishings. One reason for this is to be found in a deep-seated idealism and a controlled mental state on the part of the artisan. For an illustration of the attitude referred to there may be repeated a story originally told by Chuang Tzut during the fourth century B.C., concerning a Chinese carpenter who had fashioned a music stand that was very much ad- mired by the Emperor. The Emperor summoned the carpenter and put this question to him: "What mystery is there in your art?" To which the man re- plied: No mystery, your Highness, and yet there is something. When I am about to make such a stand ... I first reduce my mind to absolute quiescence ...

Then, with no thought of the court present to my mind, my skill becomes concentrated, and all disturbing elements from without are gone. I enter some mountain forest. I search for a suitable tree. It contains the form required, which is afterwards elaborated. I see the stand in my mind's eye, and then set to work.' Of course a comparable sense of devotion toward one's work is not unknown in our hemisphere, especially during the medieval period and in the revival of its spirit as envisaged in the handicraft movement that came into being during the second half of the nineteenth century,4 but in the Chuang Tzi legend one de- tects an element of abstraction peculiar to the Orient, responsible for certain characteristic traits in its structural and applied arts, which it will be my en- deavor to interpret in the ensuing essay. However, it must be understood at the outset-if I may be excused for verging on the obvious-that cross influences between East and West, and certain universal properties of the human mind transcending race and circumstances, prevent the distinctions that will be drawn from applying to every phase of work produced in their respective quarters of the globe. It must be conceded, also, that one assumes a difficult task in at- tempting to formulate the difference in viewpoint motivating the peoples of Eastern Asia as opposed to that affecting peoples in the Mediterranean-Atlantic regions. One can build only a partial and inadequate framework with generaliza- tions upon which the facing of particular examples fit quite loosely; but resulting from the effort may persist an overall impression that helps to clarify the diver- gent tendencies between the two cultural traditions. A people's idea concerning the universe and their place in it more or less colors every activity in which they engage. Metaphysical, or religious-philosophic concepts (the two are seldom separated in the popular mind), therefore, bear consideration for insight into the nature of artistic trends. One can readily see that an Egyptian temple differs from a Gothic cathedral in system of construc- tion, treatment of inner space and relation to external shape, decoration, lighting, and uses to which the monuments are put, because of dissimilar religious be- liefs held by the nations constructing them. And, in the same vein, although a matter considerably more complex, it is here proposed to seek a deeper compre- hension of architecture (secular as well as religious) and its allied arts through an examination of the basic ideologies held by Far Eastern and Western peoples. Let us begin with the more familiar. The West arrived at its first great cul- tural culmination in the classic civilization where state-administered religious rites supported a nationalistic mythology in which the escapades of the gods served to explain natural and supernatural occurrences., During the decadence of classic culture the native beliefs and ideas were undermined by various mystery cults originating in the Levant, headed by the prophet group including Zoroastrianism and its derivative Mithraism, Judaism and its offspring Chris- 3 Herbert A.

Because of its greater flexibility and powers of absorption and adaptation Christianity emerged the victor after many centuries of proselytism in barbaric Europe.7 Though superficially the older polytheism and newer monotheism seemed at odds with one another, upon closer examination they are seen to have basic similarities agreeable to the persisting disposition of Western man. First of all they are theistic: deities play an important role as creators of the firmament, the earth, and all living beings, including-in a special category-man, molded in the likeness of the Almighty. The tutelary lord of the nation demands a cer- tain amount of adoration in return for which is promised prosperity. The final good of life is survival of death and continued existence in a place resembling the best that this planet has to offer. In specific ways Western religions of ancient times and of the middle ages and afterwards indicate an unbroken continuity, as in the exchange of new canonized figures for images of old pagan gods occupy- ing niches in the places of worship.8 Constantine, the first Christian emperor of the Roman Empire, was deified by act of the senate according to custom after his decease, and also was immortalized as a saint, though "Saint" Constantine is mostly a legendary character.9 The Christian God is imagined presiding over Paradise in much the same capacity as Zeus on Mount Olympus, attended by corps of angels and other beings substituting for the Homeric host, taking an equally lively interest in events on Earth, and both begetting sons out of human mothers. Nothing important happens without the knowledge and will of the hierarchy. To the Greeks man was the measure of all things, which proposition applied even to the realm of divine beings,"0 and was insistently propagated by the cultural successors of the Hellenes. The West is justly famous for its ego, expressed indirectly in the myths about its gods, described as jealous, demanding, and revengeful, as well as loving and beneficent, but never professing humility." The god, therefore, is the ideal arche- 8 Franz Cumont, The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism, Chicago, 1911. This elasticity is demonstrated in the adoption of Mithra's birthday for Christmas during the time of Constantine (whose army was largely composed of Mithraists); and the holiday Easter takes its name from a Teutonic fertility goddess, remembered in Easter bunnies, eggs and newly-hatched chicks. 8 John Summerson, Heavenly Mansions, New York, 1950, pp. 20-21. At the Vatican a key was exchanged for the thunderbolt in the hand of an image of Jupiter which then became a representation of St. Peter. 9 James Hastings, ed., The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, New York, 1912, Vol. IV, pp. 75-81; Mrs. Jameson, Sacred and Legendary Art, London, 1891, Vol. II, p. 687, foot- note. 10 During the Periclean Age the worship of Phoebus Apollo was so offended by the declar- ation of Anaxagoras that the sun was not an anthropomorphic god but an inanimate body like the earth that he was tried for blasphemy, convicted and thrown into prison in Athens. 11 The linking of hero and god was a prevalent notion in primitive cultures throughout the world, as shown in Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces (New York, 1949). The West has never shown a general inclination to accept the thinking of a mature mind counter to said notion, such as China enjoyed in that of Lao TzAi, and India and the whole East in that of the Buddha.</page><page sequence="4">290 CLAY LANCASTER type to Western man, and he, himself, submits only to what he considers the embodiment of that ideal. His desire to retain always his present identity is plainly a display of ego, wherein his unwillingness to surrender individuality, even in death, has resulted in the invention of elaborate religious mechanisms purporting to assure him of survival. The general adoption of the mystery cults replacing the less personal state religions of Greece and Rome is a conspicuous illustration of this point, and once established, there has been little turning back other than temporarily, as at the time of the French Revolution. We in the Occident are so accustomed to thinking of religion in terms of the adoration of gods and striving after personal salvation that we find it difficult to accept as religion any doctrine lacking these two features. It is for this reason that the word metaphysics or a hyphenated term is used to designate the sub- ject considered in the broader sense. The counterpart of religion-philosophy among cultivated people in the Far East has seen fit to lay more stress upon the second element, being on the whole more principled and rational (as opposed to emotional) than in the West. In China the function of the deity is divided between two agents, neither of which is personified or like any existing object. The ancient philosophers primarily associated with these two concepts are, respectively, Confucius (K'ung-fu-tzu- born ca. 551 B.C.) and Lao Tzui (born ca. 604 B.C.). The active agent is called T'ien, "sky," "heaven," or "Heavenly (Ruler)," which controls happenings in the physical realm."2 The creative aspect is called Tao, which, according to the first book on the subject,'3 ascribed to Lao Tzut, is referred to as the Unnamable, described only in negatives, yet is a positive force inasmuch as it is the ultimate essence and impulse of all definite things. The Chinese character for Tao literally means "road" or "way," and that way for man is to achieve without great as- sertion and without strife. One's proper relation to the universe is non-action, Wu wei, and quietness, ching. Through concentration on the Tao, man is in- structed in humility, self-control, and consideration for others.14 About the be- ginning of the Christian era Taoism passed into a phase in which there was much preoccupation with magic, alchemy, and sorcery; but the original philosophic essentials were given fresh vitality by the introduction of Buddhism, throwing them into new light, and through imitation of which Taoism became an institu- tional religion. The association of native Chinese and Buddhist metaphysics reminds one of the similarities that have been indicated between the classic and Christian. In the Far East one did not supersede the other, as in the West, but the two were allowed to flourish side by side. A legend tells how Lao Tzqi departed from China riding on a water buffalo headed toward the southwest and emerged (reincarnated?) in India teaching in the person of the Buddha,'6 a fantasy fac- tually absurd though containing some truth in a figurative sense. 12 Dr. A. C. Bouquet has said that Confucius' concept of T'ien "tended to de-anthropo- morphise Deity" (Comparative Religion, Harmondsworth, England, 1950, p. 182). 13 Later given the title Tao T9 Ching (The "Way-Virtue Classic") by Hsiian-tsung, seventh emperor of the T'ang Dynasty (eighth century). 14 John C.

It focuses attention upon seeking after bliss through liberation from the transitory world, which is accomplished by means of moral discipline and meditation, whereby the mind sees through the veil of illusion and attains to wisdom. The method is called the Middle Way, avoiding the two extremes of worldliness and asceticism, and pursuing a chaste, temperate, and kindly life guided by the inner light."6 Any achievement is through one's own efforts; and although the element of grace is present in later Buddhism, it never plays more than a minor role."7 The existence of divinities is not denied, but they are looked upon from a point of view different from that in stricter theisms, as entities but little greater than man. In Taoism supernatural beings are mainly nature spirits, legendary heroes, and immortals,"8 and in Buddhism they are the Hindu gods divested of much of their awe,19 and, like man and all other creatures, apprentices to the Dharma, or Universal Law, which they may learn more of from a human if he be sufficiently enlightened.20 Buddhist doctrine is permeated with awareness of the impermanence of physi- cal phenomena.21 Objects disintegrate and individuals die, and although their components continue to exist the thing itself has ceased to be. To what extent metempsychosis or reincarnation is Buddhist is a moot problem. Certain it is, as mentioned above, that the final goal is release from the existential world into the unlimited state of Nirvana, often spoken of as extinction, meaning the at- tainment of oneness wherein are extinguished all distinctions. One readily sees in this a theory diametrically opposed to that of the Occident, where it is hoped to retain one's individualization permanently. In the Far East it would seem illogical that to become eternal could ever be accomplished other than by first becoming universal.22 The antipathy for physicality would warrant indifference toward the proposition of adulating as such the creator of the temporal world. 16 One notes the use of the word "way." Although with a slightly different connotation than the Chinese Tao the two Ways are identical in application. 17 Through the intercession of bodhisattvas one may be "saved" to Amida's Paradise in much the same manner as a Christian goes to Heaven; but the attainment of Nirvana still lies ahead, in which: "You yourself must make the effort, Buddhas only point the way" (Dhammapada, 276). 18 Ferguson, op. cit., pp. 61-97, 108-132. 19 In Hinduism there is wide latitude in the treatment of gods. The popular religion venerates them much as in the West, whereas among philosophic groups the gods are re- garded (or disregarded) as in Buddhism. 20 Buddhist writings refer to the Buddha as the "teacher of gods and men." Buddhas, therefore, are considered superior to gods; but they are never worshipped, although ex- pressions-even offerings-of thanks for relaying means of attaining to wisdom may seem so. Petitionary prayers would be unthinkable, save perhaps for guidance to enlightenment, certainly not for physical gains. 21 As also is much of early Greek philosophy from the seventh century, crystallizing in the thought of Heraclitus during the sixth, but never circulated beyond a relatively small group compared to the vast populations accepting Buddhism in Greater India and the Far East. 22 In Taoism immortality lay in the total ceaseless change, in Buddhism in Nirvana, either of which can be realized now.</page><page sequence="6">292 CLAY LANCASTER We have touched upon a few highlights in Eastern and Western outlook as regards the status of gods, the destiny of the soul, and the operation of the world scheme, which are the main points to be considered in translating religious- philosophic concepts into principles applicable to art. As a simplified generaliza- tion it may be observed that the West is more bent upon a transference of familiar forms into the heavenly realm, whereas the Far East conceives of a spiritual plane unrelated to the material. In religious art this is borne out in the tendency for Grecian gods and Christian angels to look anatomically sound, each bone and muscle accounted for, whereas Chinese dragons and Buddhist bodhisattvas in whatever medium seem composed of ectoplasmic stuff, and if they be poly- cephalic and display several pairs of limbs it is to indicate that they are not sub- ject to physiology. Western figures are usually mounted squarely upon blocky pedestals, the Eastern precipitated in misty space or poised lightly upon an open lotus flower. In Occidental painting superhuman beings are shaded to give the illusion of sculptured plasticity, while in the East such representations respect the flatness of plane surfaces, thereby achieving a quality that is not of this world, nor postulates another having resemblances to it. In directing our thoughts now toward the field of architecture and the decora- tive arts the first principle that comes to mind is that of solidarity in the West as opposed to fragility in the East. The Western edifice is composed of thick masonry walls as against Eastern construction of slender timbers. In the Japanese house the floors are covered with mats of straw and the fenestration is paper stretched on light frames. The Far East is the homeland of the most delicate porcelains, of a thinness for utilitarian objects unknown until imported into Europe. Lacquer is practically weightless and may be considered our first plas- tic.2" Silk, which is lustrous and sheer, is the textile pre-eminently associated with Cathay. Articles of translucent jade are the more beautiful and precious because they are fragile. However, barring accidents, all of these materials are about as lasting as any substance of their class can be. The same holds true for architec- ture. Far from setting out purposely to build impermanently the Yellow Race understood that all forms of matter decompose in time, and that stone may wear worse than wood, in which opinion they are substantiated by the fact that the 1300-year-old timber buildings at the Horyuji have outlasted many a con- temporary masonry building destroyed by earthquake, settling, erosion, or other causes.24 In Chinese and Japanese construction care is taken that wooden posts are raised off the ground with its shifting saturation and that they are sheltered from snow and rainfall. During storms and terrestrial disturbances the timbers have enough play to bear the brunt of harsh treatment and survive, under which conditions stone would crack and tumble. This is in line with Lao Tzq's maxims that to be alive is to be pliant, that stiffness is death, and to preserve tenderness in lieu of becoming hardened by life is a sign of having great strength.2 23 Lacquer was in use in South China by the fourth century B.C., and the first signs of porcelain date from the end of the Han Dynasty (A.D. 220).

By this is not meant to negate the first principle, but rather to characterize it as tentative and useful only as an initial impression. After all, Charles Dickens' impression of American dwellings was that each looked as if it had been put up just for the weekend and was going to be taken down the first thing Monday morning,26 which hardly accords with what we know about well-built, early nineteenth-century architecture in this country on the whole, and yet we recog- nize in it a measure of justification. The quality of seeming fragile among historic Western buildings of the first rank is exhibited in the attenuated clustered colonnettes, narrow ribs, and lace-like tracery of Gothic cathedrals, which are- as will be seen in later references-of the style with the least number of Western affinities, previous to the modern. The second principle is the primacy given to external form in the West and to inner volume in the East. The idealization of form attained its fullest expression in Greek art. Man's physical body was taken as the norm for comely form, which, as has been intimated, the representation of a god could not excel. In one sense the evolution of Greek sculpture was striving after closer imitation of the human body.2Y Greek architecture adhered to a form-or forms-almost as concrete as that serving as a model for sculpture, to which testifies the sameness of Greek temples. This form is something quite different from and superior to the ma- terials of which the building is built, an aesthetic reality so satisfying that one forgets about the marble, stone, brick, terracotta, stucco, and paint through which it is expressed.28 The Doric column is a form acceptable as complete in itself, as an abstract sculptured figure having a torso and a head, and belonging to the male sex. The entasis of the shaft transforms the column from a purely geometric into an organic mass. The Ionic and Corinthian orders are stylized ladies, slim, slippered and with fancy headdresses.29 The contours of certain classic moldings have been thought of as having affinities to the human profile." During antiquity and the Renaissance (which includes down to our own day) a monumental building could not be imagined without the elements cited any 26 American Notes for General Circulation, London, 1842, p. 170. 37 The author's "Greek and Hindu Gods," College Art Journal, summer 1953, pp. 336-338. 38 Conrad Fiedler's Essay on Architecture, translated by Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., Alvina Brower, Victor Hammer and Carolyn Reading, Lexington, Ky., 1954, pp. 8-11 (first pub- lished in German in 1878, a discussion of the views of Gottfried Semper). as The association of columns to human figures is borne out in several Greek buildings: the great Temple of Zeus Olympus (ca. 470 B.C.) at Acragas, Sicily, in which 25' sculptured male figures (telamones), raised on a screen wall, are alternated with 56'7" Doric columns to support the massive entablature; and in the south porch of the Ionic Erectheum (late fifth century), on the Athenian Acropolis, six freestanding female figures (caryatids) 7'8" in height carry a full entablature on their heads, the marble maidens descendants of similar supports in-antis of the sixth-century Cnidian and Siphnian treasuries at Delphi.

A building was planned from the outside in, for which reason the exteriors of Greek and Roman buildings-with few exceptions-3' are more interesting than the in- teriors. During the Renaissance, temple forms were built for secular uses, divided into several floor levels and a multiplicity of rooms, creating strange relation- ships in scale. The Far East always has thought of a building first in terms of the inside. From this source Frank Lloyd Wright found substantial support for what in the terminology of the Chicago School is called "organic" architecture.32 Lao TzA conceived that the utility of a vessel depends upon its non-existence, that is, upon its hollowness.33 Similarly, the reality of a house is not the four walls and the roof but the space within, the space that is to be lived in. The erection of a Chinese or Japanese house, temple or any other building begins with the three- dimensional marking off of the volume to be enclosed by a framework of verticals and horizontals, of standard lengths for the sake of uniformity, which is then covered by the roof and bounded by fixed or sliding screen walls, allowing con- siderably more flexibility than in the traditional Western house with its weight- bearing outer and partition walls. In European medieval buildings, climaxed in the Gothic, the interior organization was given precedence over outer form and the skeletal system of construction was employed,34 but only to be superseded by a return to the "proper" Western system in the revival called the Renais- sance. The Western aversion to the formless is shown in the concept of primeval chaos, out of which God (the form of the Absolute) created order by bestowing upon it form, which He pronounced to be good. The pristine formless state is looked upon as dreadful, something to be avoided, and indeed may be through redemption of man's personal form. By contrast the Eastern view conceives the original formless state as admirable, being free from strife, rejected because of our foolish desire to be limited by form. It is for us eventually to renounce at- tachment to form and to re-enter the primordial serenity. It can readily be seen how the attitudes toward forms in art in the West and East follow from these respective speculations. The third principle has to do with the individual versus the integral unit. As the Greek column is self-contained, so is every element in classic architecture proper to the West, while each member in a Japanese house is indiscriminate both before and after it is given a place in the total structure. W6lfflin has pointed out that the parts tend to become merged in Western Baroque architecture;35 31 The notable exception is the circular Pantheon in Rome, built early in the second century by the Emperor Hadrian, the interior elaborated with columned recesses, niches, and a coffered domed ceiling. 32 Frank Lloyd Wright, An Organic Architecture, the Sir George Watson Lectures of the Sulgrave Manor Board for 1939, London, 1939, pp. 2-4. 33 Tao T6 Ching, 11. 34 Most dramatically displayed in the stonework of thirteenth-century cathedrals; but not to be overlooked are the half-timber houses in which the module system was employed, much as in Japan to this day. 35 Heinrich W6lfflin, Principles of Art History, London, 1932 (translated by M. D. Hottin-</page><page sequence="9">METAPHYSICAL BELIEFS AND ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES 295 but it is only because they are blurred or melted together, after earlier having been individualized, which is something quite different from never having be- come constituents of orders in the first place. In this connection it is interesting to note that a group of Baroque-manner buildings was built for the pleasure of the Ch'ien Lung Emperor outside Peking a century following the peak of the style in Europe; yet it is certain that no Greek building ever would have ap- pealed to a thoroughgoing Chinese.36 Gothic comes into the picture once more under the Eastern characteristics. The parts tend to become fused into the whole organism of the Gothic cathedral; but being of stone instead of wood they are not interwoven to the same degree as posts, beams, and the branch-like duplica- tion of brackets in a Chinese or Japanese temple. In the West a door is a door, a window a window, and a wall a wall; but in the Japanese house an opening is both door and window, and when the screens are shut it becomes a wall. The furnishings are often integrated into the architecture in Japan, banks of drawers and cupboard spaces combined into stairways, and shelves and presses set into alcove recesses, the tatami (floor mats) serving as cushioned rugs-never soiled by shoes that have been worn out of doors-and as seats or beds.37 Few pieces of movable furniture are needed. The principal rooms are not isolated for spe- cialized purposes as in our conventional houses, any part serving as reception hall, dining room or chamber as occasion demands, expanded or contracted in size at will. Service, utility, bath rooms, etc., of course, have a singleness of purpose, as with us. The principle of individualizing the components of Western buildings is shown in the separation of style or decoration from construction. The latter constitutes the supporting mass of a building, the former the external garment with which it is clothed. Once when A. Welby Pugin was contemplating the British Houses of Parliament with their picturesque outlines that ill conform to the symmetrical bulk of the layout, he is reported to have remarked: "All Grecian, sir; Tudor details on a classic body."38 On the opposite side of the world style is not an independent facing. In the Japanese house the essential structural members are made and put together so artistically that further elaboration is not needed; and in richer types of buildings color and carving are applied directly to the func- tioning parts, revealing the construction rather than masking it." An additional principle may be derived from the relationships noted concerning structure and ger from the 7th revised German edition of 1915), pp. 185 (Multiplicity and Unity), 222-224 (Clearness and Unclearness). 36 For a description of these buildings and comparisons with their French and Italian prototypes see the author's "The 'European Palaces' of Yuan Ming Yuan," Gazette des Beaux-Arts, October 1948, pp. 261-288. 37 Edward S.

One may object that there are too many buildings in the Far East bedecked with ex- traneous ornament, such as the gaudy seventeenth-century shrines at Nikko,40 to validate the principle. The fact of the objection is correct, but it does not preclude that simplicity has been employed more effectively in China and Japan than ever it has with us up to modern times.4' Decoration as the means of distinguishing "architecture" from mere "building" is evidence of the Western trend,42 and the Eastern aspect can be clarified by embarking upon a short review of the objective and influence of a special school of Buddhism in the Far East. Nowhere in the world has the application of a philosophic viewpoint been more of a positive factor in art than in the transformation of subtle Zen concepts into Japanese artistic practice.43 Similarities to Taoism indicate some indebtedness to this system, though Zen is traced directly to the arrival in China of Bodhidharma, the twenty-eighth Buddhist patriarch, from India about A.D. 520, at which time he founded the Chinese Ch'an or Meditation School. However great has been the influence of this group in China, it has been even greater in Japan, where the first sect was established soon after 1200.44 The universal achievement in Zen (the Japanese word for Ch'an) is satori, or sudden enlightenment. It is stressed that non-essentials be eliminated from one's thinking, pattern of life and sur- roundings, a return to the purity of primitive Buddhism only having a new aesthetic angle. Zen monasteries became known for their simplicity and for their cleanliness, in large measure due to the exclusion of dust-collecting ornamenta- tion. In the tea ceremony developed by Zen patrons (beginning about the fifteenth century) the mastery and simplification of every movement was ele- vated into a high art; and the exquisite austerity of the tea-house (chaseki), modest in size, in which extreme care was taken to incorporate the least preten- tious materials kept as natural as possible, had a profound affect upon the 40 These are, however, monuments of Shintoism rather than Buddhism, with which we are more concerned. al Characteristic of the West, where men preach what they never practice, we find func- tional views in architectural literature going back at least as far as the Abb6 Marc Antoine Laugier's Observations sur Architecture, 1765, that influenced the somewhat simplified "cottage farm" designs of the English architect Joseph Gandy (Designs for Cottages . . a, 1805; Rural Architecture, 1806). Claude Nicolas Ledoux, active in France during the Louis XVI period and later, designed buildings of predominantly geometric forms, though de- tails remained the classic orders (Ledoux's L'Architecture Considdrge sous le Rapport de l'Art des Moeurs et de la Legislation, Paris, 1804). Even Louis Sullivan seldom applied his "Kindergarten Chats," the ideas set forth awaiting realization in the work of his apt pupil, F. L. Wright. 42 Mid-nineteenth-century books on architecture often published plans that could be carried out in any of several styles, such as William H.

The severity of the tea room has prompted the epithet "abode of vacancy."45 Here frugality is considered in no sense privation but rather a means of directing one's attention to the full appreciation of the charm and beauty of unassuming objects. The tokonoma, or principal recess, in the Japanese tea-house or main room of the dwelling, is the one place where works of art are displayed, limited to a single fine piece, usually a hanging scroll painting, complemented by a simple flower arrangement or sprig of blossoms in season, producing an atmosphere of such serenity as to provide the most favorable environmental circumstances for con- templating the art object without distraction from other pieces. The same restriction to essentials was carried over into painting and examples of calligraphy for use in the tokonoma, the tea utensils themselves, costumes and accessories worn by the participants, and from these into art generally. As Zen brought spiritual illumination to the dedicated few, its well-tutored prot6g6, teaism, imparted aesthetic enlightenment to just about everyone.46 From the Occidental and Oriental viewpoints regarding the individual comes the fifth principle, the distinction of verticality in the West as opposed to hori- zontality in the Far East. The upright line represents the rugged individualist, discrete and unswerving; the horizontal line of repose typifies him who is attuned to the universe, who sees himself mirrored in all things and all things in him- the contour of the sea that embraces the nonillion drops of water into a single ocean. Through its emphasis upon the perpendicular, Gothic architecture reveals its most Western affiliation, that was brought to full fruition centuries later in the American skyscraper. Stone construction is best expressed in the upright rectangle, that first characterized the bay in the Egyptian temple, whence it next appeared in Europe; and timber framing, proper to the East, is by nature a horizontal rectangle of no great height. Buildings of the Flowery Kindgom are laid out on a single level in a series of pavilions connected by galleries and interspersed with garden courts. To one accustomed to such agreeable arrange- ments the tall building becomes offensive. In this connection an observation made by K'ang Hsi (1662-1722) deserves mention. The Chinese Emperor was being shown engravings of late seventeenth-century, multistoried European buildings, and instead of being impressed by their size and altitude as expected he commented quite frankly that Europe must indeed be a poor and miserable country inasmuch as there was no space to expand the cities and people had to live in the air!47 The first thing one notices about a European or American building is its wall; which is rusticated, pierced by niches and openings encircled by moldings, over- spread with a network of pilasters and entablatures, and often extending up into a parapet that conceals the roof. Here is the proof of directing attention to ver- 46 Okakura-Kakuzo, The Book of Tea, Tokyo (reprint of New York, 1906 edition), n.d., p. 47. 46 For further reading see Arthur Waley, Zen Buddhism and Its Relation to Art, London, 1922; D.

One expects elevations to have been the first drawings made, as fagades were the first features conceived. At the farther extremity of Asia it is the roof that attracts and holds our interest, being a vast, spreading affair projecting its protective overhang far beyond the planes of the walls. The roof is developed into a system of surfaces of varying easy curves and harmonious angles, often covered with tiles that render it exceedingly heavy, the hips and especially the ridge elaborated by an infinitude of devices.48 Besides sheltering the building from the rain, the wide eaves aid in temperature control, affording cool shade when the sun is high in the summer sky, and allowing the warm rays to enter the apartments when the sun remains low in the wintertime. The importance of the roof indicates the pre-- dilection toward favoring the horizontal in Far Eastern architecture. The horizontal line, signifying purity and unity, predominates in Sino-Japanese temples; it soars not upward to meet the One that is over all, but reaches out- ward seeking the oneness that is in all-on an equal level. With a minimizing of the uprights the Japanese house is sustained through finesse of joinery. It is put together with an accuracy belonging to cabinetwork. We are reminded again of the episode told by Chuang Tzuw about the emperor and the maker of the music stand who concentrated his whole attention upon his work to the extent of losing himself in it. The matter of experiencing identi- fication is the subject of Yoga-the Sanskrit word for "union"-which in India is a technical science divided into numerous schools having various modes of interpretation and application.49 The highly systematized Indian Yoga came to supplement the Chinese correlative through Buddhism, and from this inter- marriage some comprehension of the aims and procedures sifted down to the humblest workmen to the improvement of the crafts in which they were engaged. For our purpose it is enough to recognize that this involved wholehearted ap- preciation of and for one's own work, to the forgetting of self, and a discipline of mind and body bringing about a concentration of effort capable of accomplish-- ing near-miracles. The West, accustomed to thinking of enthusiasm as the alert attitude toward giving the best performance, has trouble understanding the theory of the passive approach, though it has recognized the excellence of its fruits.50 The Western artisan stands aloof from what he is doing, whereas the Eastern establishes an intimate relationship with it. Out of the two methods of procedure can be devised a sixth principle, to wit: in the West the architect or craftsman remains an individual apart from his work; in the East the producer and production become mystically merged into one. Again the self-complacency of Western man as opposed to the sympathetic position of the Eastern are noted to be determining factors in the principles. In the West the architect devises the 48 Morse, op. cit., pp. 84-107. 4 The three main branches are (1) related to works (Karma Yoga), a sub-branch of which is gaining control of the bodily functions (Hatha Yoga), (2) devotion (Bhakti), and (3) discipline of the mind (JRina or Raja Yoga). 50 It is recalled how Americans rudely laughed at the unfamiliar building operations of the Japanese during the construction of the first authentic Nipponese building in this country, at the Philadelphia Centennial of 1876 (Philadelphia Times), and when it was completed the work was judged the best at the fair-grounds (Portfolio)-see footnote 1.</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICAL BELIEFS AND ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES 299 design of the building and then turns it over to the contractor or engineer to execute. In the East-as also in Europe through the medieval period-the master builder plans the building and likewise conducts its construction; to do other- wise for him would be as unthinkable as for one woman to conceive a child and another to give birth to it. Relying more upon a mental image formed from past experience than upon two-dimensional delineations of what is going to be a three- dimensional structure, the Eastern builder obtains satisfactory results the first. time more often than the Western architect deluded by his paper-work preoccu- pation with forms instead of with real effects.5" Thomas Jefferson was forty years designing, re-designing, building, tearing down, and rebuilding Monticello.62 In the same way a Western painter often spends years upon a single picture, shifting forms, altering colors, making corrections, additions, deductions, a thousand-and-one changes, unlike the Far Eastern painter, who first quiets his. mind through meditation, and, channeling his energies, begins and completes his painting at one sitting without a single false stroke of the brush. The technique used is that employed throughout Eastern creative endeavors all the way down to the most prosaic work, the speed of accomplishment itself a constant source of amazement to uninitiated Westerners."3 Although the sixth principle chiefly concerns processes of bringing objects of art or architecture into being, it also! has a bearing upon the finished products insofar as the Western have the ap- pearance of being over-studied in comparison to the freshness and spontaneity- of the Far Eastern. It is only to be expected that the designer who never rolls up his sleeves and participates in the work will be satisfied by effects and even shams, unlike the true craftsman who adores honesty of materials and sound workmanship above all else. By the time of the high Renaissance in Italy architects began to be con- tent with stucco over brick in imitation of stone. A case in point is Palladio, whose books on architecture had a more widespread influence throughout Europe,. the British Isles, and America than his buildings at home." In the Baroque' 51 Edward S. Morse records in the mid 1880's that several of his Japanese friends pre- sented him with the drawings made by the builder for their houses, which were limited to floorplans (Morse, op. cit., p. 48). Of course we know that the Chinese and Japanese both make elevation sketches, but it seems that many aesthetic considerations, such as the- breaking up of the planes and pitch of the roof, are given final decision on the job. 52 Thomas Tileston Waterman, The Mansions of Virginia, 1706-1776, Chapel Hill, 1945,. pp. 388-398. 53 Charles H. P. Copeland tells of a friend who sent a suit to be copied by a tailor in Osaka during the 1920's, and that: "Two reproductions of that suit were in his hands in forty-eight hours, complete to the darn in the left elbow of each jacket and the dangling thread of a missing button on each jacket sleeve . . ." Antiques, July 1954, p. 51. 54 In England, for instance, there were four villas modeled on the Villa Rotunda, built between 1723 and 1756: Mereworth Castle in Kent, Chiswick House, Nuthall Temple and Foots Cray Place (Dorothy Stroud, "Four Palladian Villas," Country Life, 8 October- 1948, pp. 728-731); a similar building in Russia is the Palace Pavlosk, 1781-96, by the Scott- ish-born architect Charles Cameron (Tamara Talbot Rice, Russian Art, West Drayton, 1949, pp. 184-185, pl. 13); and in America, Thomas Jefferson, who owned at various times five sets of reprints of Palladio's books, two in French and three in English, used the Villa Rotunda as the basis for at least three projects: the Governor's house in Richmond, 1784,. the President's house in Washington, 1792, and a proposed alteration at Shadwell (?), 1803-</page><page sequence="14">300 CLAY LANCASTER period the use of composition marble was standard practice. Revival architecture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries popularized wood and stuccoed col- umns, plaster vaults, and sanded-painted walls simulating stonework. Even housewright-carvers of good reputation, such as Samuel McIntire of Salem, copied the stone forms of orders in wood with some attenuation as the only con- cession to the difference in medium.5 The roots of this characteristic in the West go back to the Greeks, who in architecture cared more for form than for materials (second principle, footnote 28)-and in sculpture came to have practically no respect for the properties of the material at all (footnote 27). The Egyptians before them had gessoed and painted both their buildings and statuary. Nowhere is there higher regard for the natural finish of wood, terracotta, stone, metals, etc., than in the Far East. An opalescent patina on an ancient bronze is prized as highly as jade. Although polychromy belongs more to architecture than to fine painting in China,56 in Japan for paint or any other artificial coating to be applied to wood is the exception rather than the rule. Even plastered surfaces are not painted, though sometimes colored sand, silk fibers, or iron filings (for a rust-red tint) are mixed in the plaster itself for tone and texture variations. In the West woodwork seldom is left without paint, shellac, stain, varnish, or wax; or plaster uncovered by paint or paper, unless these are not available. Compared to the Far East the Occident is no respecter of nature nor of naturalness. The seventh principle concerns the finish of building substances, in which the West and East differ, the former processing and concealing them and the latter keep- ing them in the raw. The Far Eastern peoples are the world's greatest nature lovers. Their philos- ophy is largely based upon nature and man's unexalted place in it. The landscape is by far the most common subject in Chinese and Japanese painting. Wherever possible a man builds his house for the view. If the house is to be in the city a small garden answers the purpose on a small scale, each part of the building opening into a diminutive square of nature containing trees and other plants, rocks, and a pool or brook.57 The concave curve of Chinese roofs in all probability came about during the sixth century as a result of perceiving how the sag of the roofs of old buildings responded to the arcs of the hills and pines of the East Asian landscapeA8 The sliding outer screens of the Japanese house enable the rooms to be opened up to the great out-of-doors. Even during the winter the shoji are pushed back during the day to afford the family a vista of the snow in not one of which was built, though there is a strong Palladian influence in Jefferson's ex- ecuted work (the author's "Italianism in American Architecture before 1860," American Quarterly, summer 1952, pp. 130-131). 66 Fiske Kimball, Mr. Samuel McIntire, Carver, the Architect of Salem, Portland, Me., 1940. 66 The colorful ancestor portraits are considered commercial art in China, outside the field of fine arts.

Color on a Chinese temple or palace is a response to the hues of nature, the blue of the sky, the greens of foliage, and the reds, yellows and lavenders of flowers and flowering shrubs. On the other hand the subdued tones of the Japanese house are in consonance with the perennial rather than with the seasonal colors of nature. The model residence in Japan is the delightful Katsura Villa begun late in the sixteenth or early seventeenth century on an eleven-acre estate in the southwest suburbs of Kyoto, becoming an imperial seat in 1883.59 While far from imposing, the group of buildings represents the acme of elegance conjoined with all the conscious rural charm of a Hameau, though avoiding the latter's sentimental overtones. The villa is blended into its setting to such perfection that the casual observer may regard the architectural composition quite matter-of-factly, completely missing the subtlety of skill that has brought about this flawless unity of nature and construction. Europe some- times strove to join architecture and nature by formalizing the latter and holding it at bay with walls and balustrades, gravel terraces and stone-bordered pools, and shaping plants into artificial forms, such as in hedges and topiaries. A Euro- pean building like the Chateau at Versailles, built with vast stretches of open country around it, still retains the characteristics of a palais constructed adjacent to the sidewalk of a Parisian boulevard. The eighteenth-century English park was an adaptation of Chinese landscaping, called a "jardin anglo-chinois" on the continent, but the accompanying Chinese-type buildings were all incidental structures serving as exotic and frivolous retreats, serious British architecture remaining faithful to Western standards.60 In medieval examples the cathedrals of England are distinctive from the usual run in Europe located in the center of towns because of being situated in the country. However, the location was chosen not from any love of nature but out of necessity, the outlying farmlands providing the support for the large number of inmates of the monastery to which each cathedral was attached. In these churches there was no provision for fresh air or the admission of natural light, because of a predisposition to maintain an atmosphere that would heighten the dramatic effect of the liturgy. The last principle asserts that Western building is considered apart from nature, and that Far Eastern is made to accord with it. The eight principles that have been suggested propose the differences between Western and Far Eastern architecture to be: (1) that the first has the appearance of solidarity and the second that of lightness, (2) that the one considers the building from the point of view of form and the other from that of volume, (3) that the first is composed of individualized parts and the second of integrated units, (4) that the former shows a tendency to embellish and the latter an in- clination to simplify, (5) that Western building designs stress verticality and the Eastern horizontality, (6) that Occidental architects stand on a formal 59 Sutemi Horiguchi (English r6sum6 by Jiro Harada), The Katsura Imperial Villa, Tokyo, 1953; Bruno Taut, Fundamentals of Japanese Architecture, Tokyo, 1936, pp. 19-21, figs. 19-25. 60 Eleanor von Erdberg, Chinese Influence on European Garden Structures, Cambridge, 1936; Osvald Sir6n, China and Gardens of Europe of the XVIII Century, New York, 1950.</page><page sequence="16">302 CLAY LANCASTER footing with their work and the Oriental architects establish a close association with it, (7) that the first is more concerned with effects and the second a forth- right exhibit of materials, and (8) that in the West a building is withdrawn from the natural environment whereas in the Far East it is identified with the setting. The first principle is to be taken as tentative, the second regards planning, the third to fifth relate to style, the sixth concerns the agent, the seventh deals with materials, and the eighth has to do with architectural design and nature. Modern Western architecture-especially the residential-is perceived to have a stronger relationship to the characteristics of buildings in the Far East than to traditional Occidental constructions, shunning massiveness, planned from the inside out, having undistinguished parts, stripped of ornament, the lines pre- dominantly horizontal, requiring a high standard of workmanship, honest use of materials, and some attention paid to fitting buildings into the landscape wherever possible. A moment's reflection will reveal that in the Japanese house was a ready-made democratic architecture, wanting but few changes for adapta- tion to American life. Since in the twentieth century the Chinese have given up so many of their ideals and the Japanese are fluctuating in the act of following the same course, it is only fitting that as the Far East becomes submerged in Western materialism and commercialism we should step in to preserve some of their spiritual and artistic achievements. It has happened before in history: as when Rome conquered Greece and adopted its institutions, when Great Britain seized a strangle hold upon India and popularized its art and philosophy, and when the Mongols usurped the throne of China and became as Chinese as the Chinese themselves. Oriental art and ideas are not, after all, so abstruse that we need despair of ever establishing intimate relations with them. They are like a diet in requiring assimilation to do us any good. It is better to leave them alone than to borrow motifs from them for use in fabricating novelties with an exotic twist, which is like trying to cook a foreign dinner equipped with only one or two ingredients, and without ever having eaten any of the authentic dishes. Samuel Bing was first a dealer in Japanese art before setting up his famous Art Nouveau workshop. Arthur Lasenby Liberty, who revolutionized the British textile industry, earlier managed Farmer and Roger's Oriental Warehouse in London-the first depot in England for exclusive sale of goods imported from the East-and himself jour- neyed to Japan for information. Whistler and Toulouse-Lautrec collected examples of Japanese art, which greatly influenced their work." John Scott Bradstreet, of the Bradstreet Craftshouse in Minneapolis, traveled to Japan biannually for inspiration (see footnote 4). Frank Lloyd Wright, who studied native building while working in the Island Empire, incorporated into the architecture of his own home at Spring Green, Wisconsin, specimens of Far Eastern art; and a quantity of others are displayed at every hand. The same was found to be true in a visit last spring to the studio in Carmel, California, of the elder brother of the firm of (Charles Sumner) Greene and (Henry Mather) Greene, Mrs. Greene furnishing the information that her husband would con- 61 The author's "Oriental Contributions to Art Nouveau," The Art Bulletin, December 1952, pp. 299-305.</page><page sequence="17">METAPHYSICAL BELIEFS AND ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES 303 -template items in his collection for hours as an incentive to work on his own creative endeavors in carving, sculpture, painting, designing, and building, which are superlative.62 The contemporary architect Harwell Hamilton Harris told the author that he took every opportunity as a youngster during the 1920's to study Japanese buildings from books in the Los Angeles Public Library. The Japanese flavor is strong in the designs of all of these men. The list could be lengthened indefinitely, but nothing further could be proven other than what has already, which is, that the impact of the Japanese has left its im- print upon contemporary Western architecture and art, and unless there is some unforeseen change in the trend things are taking we will see a great deal more of it for some time to come. 62 The importance of the Greene brothers was recognized in a number of publications during the second decade of the present century, and then they were forgotten until 1948 with the appearance of "A New Appreciation of 'Greene and Greene," The Architectural Record, May, pp. 138-140; and Jean Murray Bangs, "Greene and Greene," The Architectural Forum, October, pp. 81-89. Also in 1948 the Southern California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded them Special Certificates of Merit at a dinner given in their honor. Nowhere in Western building have the architects identified themselves with their work so completely as have Greene and Greene, in the selection of every tile and brick and pane of glass, and in the shaping of every timber that went into their houses. Although never in Japan themselves, their high standards for quality were the nearest to those of the Far East of all the American builders whose work I have examined, style similarities re- sulting as a natural consequence.</page></plain_text>
