<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERSONA OF CATULLUS' PHASELUS By K. M. COLEMAN The autobiography of the personified yacht (Catullus 4.2-24) yields not only a curriculum vitae but also a vivid impression of personality. Catullus' phaselus sounds very human. If the persona can be identified, its literary ancestors and the tone of the poem may also emerge. The phaselus is a talkative old craft. The emphasis on verbs of saying ('ait', 2,15; 'negat ... negare', 6 f.; 'loquente', 12; 'dicit', 16) has already been noted for its humorous insistence.' Before its timber was hewn it was already talking ('nam Cytorio in iugo/loquente saepe sibilum edidit coma', 11-12). It enumerates exhaustive alternatives ('sive palmulis/opus foret volare sive linteo', 4-5; 'tibi haec fuisse et esse cognitissima', 14; 'laeva sive dextera/vocaret aura sive utrumque Iuppiter/simul secundus incidisset in pedem', 19-21); this tendency betrays garrulous old age and also the sailor's claim to omni- competence. The retired yacht is talkative because it has had an adventurous career.2 The pure iambic metre contributes to the impression of youthful vigour. The personification of the yacht as a travel-scarred sailor is intensified by the use of the noun 'phaselus', masculine instead of the more usual feminine gender for boats. The yacht is given to name-dropping, not so much a pretentious gesture as the natural process of recall by one whose career has been spent in foreign parts; with a navigator's precision the boat recounts where it has been. The navigational record is sprinkled with 'voces propriae' ('minacis Hadriatici ... litus', 6; 'Rhodumque nobilem horridamque ... Propon- tida trucemve Ponticum sinum', 8-9); the impression of adventure and wide experience is increased as the places mentioned become more remote from a Roman point of view: Rhodes, Propontis, finally Pontus. The boat adorns place-names with further geographical epithets, which adds to the romance of its story ('Thraciam Propontida', 8). It even employs such periphrasis to refer to its own origins ('Amastri Pontica et Cytore buxifer', 13).3 The conventional boast of ancestry includes a tautologous phrase ('ultima ex origine', 15) which emphasizes both the boat's pride and its tendency to wordiness (even if the pleonasm is conventional). The phaselus appeals to the places it has visited as witnesses of his own exploits ('tibi haec fuisse et esse cognitissima', 14). Places bearing witness to exploits is a feature of panegyric4 here naturally adopted by the phaselus; false modesty was not considered a virtue in antiquity.</page><page sequence="2">THE PERSONA OF CATULLUS' PHASELUS 69 The boat's pride is conveyed by the epic tinge to its memoirs: Fordyce notes the epic flavour of 'impetum trabis' (3); 'natantis' (3) also has epic connotations; at 66.46 'nare' is used of Xerxes' voyage through Athos ('iuventus/per medium classi barbara navit Athon'); at 64.2 the same verb describes the Argo ('pinus/dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas'). The autobiography of the phaselus contains further similarities to the Argo's story: the Argo's origins as a tree are stressed at Eur. Med. 1 ff., Cat. 64.1;s Mt. Cytorus where the phaselus originated is a landmark on the Argo's voyage;6 the 'trucem Ponticum sinum' which the phaselus is proud to have survived was the stage for the main act of the Argonautic legend (Eur. Med. 1-2). Propontis and Pontus both represent areas where the strength of youth is neces- sary to burst into strange seas (cf. 66.46 for Propontis, 64.4 of the Argonauts: 'lecti iuvenes'). The echoes of the Argonautic legend strengthen the impression that the phaselus in its prime was an intrepid adventurer. The phaselus is now old, a nostalgic ex-seafarer displaying the garrulousness of the elderly; the prototype of the reminiscing soldier and sailor is Nestor, similarly wordy and pedantically specific.7 Remi- niscing about his prowess at the funeral games for Amarynceus, Nestor acknowledges the contrast between his energetic prime and the restric- tions of old age (II. 23.643-5). This is exactly the situation of the phaselus (25-6): 'sed nunc recondita senet quiete.' Nestor's account of his various achievements at the games (II. 23.629-40) supplies a parallel too for the phaselus' boast of versatility: the yacht is competent both to row and to sail under canvas (17-21). The phaselus traces its progress from birth through education. Quinn" notes the ambiguity of 'palmulas', applicable both to oar-blades and to human anatomy; 'imbuere' is likewise a double-entendre, indicating the phaselus' first tentative dips into the actual water and also the metaphorical sea of education.9 Throughout the reminiscences of the phaselus the reiterated perfect infinitives stress that its exploits belong to the past.10 The last three lines of the poem are a narrative description of the boat's present position, separate from its own reminiscences (2-24).1 The epilogue records the boat's dedication on its retirement; the dedication is anticipated by 'hospites' (1), which parallels the invocation of passers-by in Greek funerary epigrams.12 The yacht dedicates itself to the Dioscuri.13 Catullus' precedent is the Greek dedicatory epigram;14 this frequently displays the 'then and now' contrast contained in Cat. 4: for example, epigrams dedicating Lais' mirror.15 After the yacht's boast that it achieved its voyage without recourse to the 'dei litorales' (22-3), the self-dedication is mildly</page><page sequence="3">70 THE PERSONA OF CATULLUS' PHASELUS ironic.16 It is also both an act of piety and a symbol of independence; the yacht has never depended on the gods, nor has it been forced to retire: its retirement is voluntary. This dedicating act is a remarkable gesture ('seque dedicat'; 26):17 it is far more than the dedication of equipment after a completed task, as attested on ex voto inscriptions;"8 nor does the personified craft merely offer to a deity a part of its physique;19 not only is the dedicatory object the whole vessel, but also the yacht itself performs the dedication, consonant with its anthropomorphic presentation: the phaselus is both agent and object of the dedication. The dedication is further remarkable because it is made to the Dioscuri. Poseidon was the traditional recipient of such dedications; one version of the Argo's end was that Jason dedicated it to Poseidon in a ceremony at the Isthmus of Corinth.20 The Dioscuri not only protected seafarers;21 they were adventurers themselves, and they even sailed on the Argo.22 They are especially appropriate dedicatees for the phaselus to address after its successful career because they them- selves won immortality by their deeds.23 The formal specification of the deities suits the ship-shape, naval old-boy character of the phaselus, although there is mild irony in the proud vessel being dedicated to deities whose identities, like those of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, were evidently not always immediately distinguishable.24 The assonance and reiterated syllables of the last line, 'gemelle Castor et gemelle Castoris', reflect the boat's serenity in retirement; after its busy and adventurous career, it lapses into the tranquillity of old age: time is no longer so precious as to condemn repetition as a waste of words. Catullus' epilogue (25-7) sets the preceding twenty-four lines in perspective: by contrast with its boastful history, the vessel itself is now simply quiescent in dock. The boat is enjoying 'quies' (26). This concept operates on several levels: it most obviously suggests retirement (wvaXwpqoats); further, it recalls the Ciceronian ideal of 'quies et otium' appropriate for a Roman gentleman; the associations of silence contrast ironically with the garrulousness of the preceding twenty-four lines. The archaism 'senet' (26) is appropriate for the retirement of an old- fashioned boat, and also conveys a certain air of decay; 'senet' carries twin associations of old age and debilitation.25 Hornsby misses the point when he concludes that the 'emphasis of the poem is not on the "senet quiete", but on the intelligent skill of the ship'.26 The yacht, proud of its career, describes it at length and in larded language; now, says Catullus, it is in retirement, 'recondita senet quiete'. There is a double-entendre in 'recondita': the yacht is in seclusion, both geographically remote and in a situation where it</page><page sequence="4">THE PERSONA OF CATULLUS' PHASELUS 71 experiences hvaXopqo-ts. Thus in the phrase 'recondita senet quiete' every word contributes to the personification of the vessel as a navigator in retirement. After its voyages, the boat at last comes to rest, 'hunc ad usque limpidum lacum'; the brisk plosive alliteration of 'impotentia freta' (18) contrasts with the soothing liquids of its final mooring-place, 'limpidum lacum' (24). The identification of a sea-scarred vessel with a career-worn human can be traced to Alcaeus LGS 119,27 where the comparison is with the pitiable figure of an aged courtesan. In Catullus, however, the comparison is dignified:28 vitriol is replaced by the younger generation's amused tolerance of the old seafarer's garrulity. The serenity of the final three lines is a tribute of respect to the 'has been' craft now settling into inactivity. NOTES 1. H. A. Khan, AJPh 88 (1967), 165. 2. The fellow-sailors of another Catullus similarly indulge in the saga of their near-shipwreck, Juv. 12.81-2: 'gaudent ubi vertice raso/garrula securi narrare pericula nautae.' 3. For the grandiose style of line 16, reminiscent of Cat. 64.1 (and the deflating effect of the prosaic 'buxifer'), cf. Khan, 167 f. Khan, however, misses the antithesis in 'buxifer': prosaic concept expressed by the '-fer' suffix which is a mark of high style in early epic; cf. C. J. Fordyce (ed.), Catullus (Oxford, 1961), ad loc. Further, Khan's conclusion (169) that the yacht is proud of its achievements despite its ancestry seems to contradict the inflated tone of 11-13; more likely the yacht takes pride in parading abstruse ancestry, and here lies the humour: since Bithynia was forested and therefore famous for ship-building (cf. Hor. Odes 1.35.7, and Nisbet and Hubbard, ad loc.), the bare mention of its birthplace would be sufficient claim to distinction, and so the pretentious epithets betray some snobbery. 4. Cf. Nisbet and Hubbard, Hor. Odes 2.1.30. 5. The 'argumentum longius repetitum' is discussed by Nisbet and Hubbard, Hor. Odes 2.13.2. 6. Ap. Rh. 2.942: 'Avra Kmrowpov; Val. Fl. 5. 105. 7. In his very first speech Nestor substantiates the 'good old days' thesis with a battery of proper names (II. 1.254 ff., esp. 262-5). 8. K. Quinn (ed.), Catullus: The Poems2 (Macmillan, 1973), note to 4.4; cf. OLD sv. 'palmula' 1 a, c. 9. TLL 7.427.78 classifies this entry as an example of the literal use; Fordyce regards it as predominantly figurative, with a hint at the literal sense. 10. 'fuisse' (2, 14), 'nequisse' (4), 'stetisse' (16), 'imbuisse' (17), 'tulisse' (19). 11. C. E. Smith, HSCPh 3 (1892), 86, notes that Catullus makes no comment in 'propria persona' during the boat's account of its past, and only ventures evidence of his own observation at 25 ff. 12. Fordyce, ad loc. 13. H. J. Mette, RhM 105 (1962), 157, remarking on lines 26-7, fails to distinguish the phaselus from Catullus in 'propria persona': 'Jetzt erst spricht das Schiff den Gedanken aus, dass es sich den Gottern der Seefahrt weihe.' 14. Fordyce (p. 96) cites Anth. Pal. 6.69, 70 for the dedication of ships. 6.236, in praise of Octavian, records the dedication of ships' beaks after Actium. 15. Anth. Pal. 6.1. 18-20. 16. The irony is noted by Smith (n. 11), 84. 17. Smith (n. 11), 84, remarks on the singularity of self-dedication by a thank-offering. 18. Adduced as a parallel by R. A. Hornsby, AJPh 84 (1963), 257 and n. 9.</page><page sequence="5">72 THE PERSONA OF CATULLUS' PHASELUS 19. This type of vow is first attested at Iliad 23.141-51 where Achilles' father promises a lock of his son's hair to the river-god Sperchios in thanksgiving if Achilles returns from Troy. 20.

Fordyce regards the locution as standard phraseology, defining Castor as the 'dominant partner'. In this context, however, Catullus appears to exploit the humorous possibilities in the standard reference; Statius does likewise. 25. Lewis and Short sv. 'seneo'; Fordyce, ad loc. 26.

The individual's worth endures after his career has been superseded by less dazzling occupations in retirement; a similar image of the retired man of the sea expresses this concept in W. H. Auden's Song, 'Deftly, admiral, cast your fly'. For this parallel, and for his patient guidance of the drift of this article, I most sincerely thank Prof. R. G. M. Nisbet; if I have sailed close to the wind, the responsibility is entirely mine.</page></plain_text>
