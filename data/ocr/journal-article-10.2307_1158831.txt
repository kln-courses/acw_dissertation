<plain_text><page sequence="1">Africa 51(2), 1981 RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME: SPECULATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOCIAL ORDER Lynne Brydon Contemporary texts on West African crops usually note that rice is grown in areas west of the Tano: southern Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Liberia grow a considerable quantity of rice and in recent years there has been much attention given to improving both crop type and cultivation techniques. Northern Ghana has also seen the introduction of wet rice cultivation on a large scale. But there are areas in eastern Ghana, to the east of the Volta, where rice is grown.' The rice is the indigenous glaberrima type; cultivation techniques owe nothing to the developers and rice-growing has a nodal place in local culture. Little ethnographic work has been done in the Togo Hills among the groups classified by Westermann and Bryan as 'Togo Remnant' (Restvolker). These small groups generally have their own languages, although there are relationships among them (Westermann, 1952, Greenberg, 1960). Darkoh (1970) claims that some of the groups are autochthonous,2 while some are descendants of immigrants into the area. Most of the Restvdlker are in the hills to the north of Hohoe, but there is a small cluster of four groups on the south-western extremity of the Togo Ranges about twenty miles to the south of Hohoe roughly equidistant from Ho and Hohoe. Rice is grown in all of the four groups. I shall here focus on Avatime,3 but rice is also grown in Nyangbo, Tafi and Logba and it is possible that there was once much ritual attached to its cultivation.4 Here I shall look at specific aspects of rice and yam cultivation in Avatime, particularly at the rituals surrounding it. I shall demonstrate the fundamental importance of rice and show how rice and yam cultivation rituals relate to different levels of social and ideological organisation. My conclusion entails discussing the significance of the present day formal political organisation and chiefship structure in Avatime. Avatime say they are the descendants of people, originally from Ahanta (in the west of Ghana), who moved into the area. Their own name for themselves, Ked'anoma, they say comes from the fact that when they decided to settle in the area some of the group went on (to Gafe in Togo). Ked'anoma means 'people left behind'. They say they overcame the autochthonous people, the Baya, by force and by various tricks and settled where they are today. It seems likely that if there was immigration into the Avatime area, the immigrants adopted the language of the autochthones. It also seems likely that current Avatime cosmology and ideology is largely derived from that of the Baya. At the Avatime pantheon's head is an otiose being, Aya (the word in the other contexts means air or sky). All Avatime speak a single language, siyasE, which is closely related to Nyangbo and Tafi. There are seven Avatime villages and these together with the surrounding farmlands make up the Avatime traditional area. The seven villages are organised into three divisions for political and military purposes. Vane is the paramount chiefs village, but</page><page sequence="2">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME International_ Regional boundary boundary 0 Km 100 I I Motorable Road -=-. Road now obsolete - -- Bush path / Land over 300 metres 0 Km 5 South-eastern Ghana and Togo Avatime each village has its own chief and related political officers; I shall return to this later in the paper. Within each village there are named groups which claim to be able to trace descent from an agnatic forebear, either of the autochthonous group or the immigrants. We may call these groups clans. Clans are not found in more than one village. Each clan is composed of a number of agnatic descent groups, ikune (sing: oku) whose heads are the clan elders5. Each clan has an overall chief who is either always chosen from the same oku or chosen from two ikune in turn. The elders are responsible for clan morality and the continued well-being of clan members, both living and dead, as well as for settling quarrels and disputes within their ikune, clans and villages. Only if a dispute becomes too acrimonious or involves non-Avatime people or villages is the more extensive village-wide political system used6. At the oku and clan levels, too, individual women, as clan and oku members, have a considerable say in organisation and arbitration. Where the village-wide system is appealed to, then women have a voice only as a formal collectivity.7 A caveat here: in recent history the Avatime area has been subjected successively to the domination of the Germans and the British. Not only has this had gross socio- economic consequences for Avatime (see Brydon, 1979, and n.d.) but also it has had its effects in the religious sphere. Because of its position in the southernmost part of the hills, Avatime attracted early attention from missionaries. The climate is relatively cool and mosquito-free and this made a welcome change from the heat of the southern plains where missionary mortality was extremely high (Debrunner, 1965). In the 1870s missionaries from the Bremen Mission established a station in Dzokpe, at the foot of the mountains, and in 1890 a mission station was established in Amedzofe, the highest village, and the school and seminary moved there from Ho. Proselytisation was successful and as early as 1910 a pupil of the school is quoted as saying: 'In my home at 660</page><page sequence="3">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME Amedzowe there are no longer any idols. The word of God has shattered them all' (Debrunner, 1965: 137). After the first world war, the Scottish Presbyterians continued the missionary work. In view of the success of Christianity from the beginning of this century therefore it is all the more remarkable that the pantheon still has significance today. Concepts like 'soul' and 'spirits of the dead', and eschatology generally, on the other hand, are unclear and confused. I argue that the clarity of definition of the pantheon and its current significance are associated with its inextricable relations with rice cultivation and all it entails.8 RICE IN AVATIME The head of the pantheon is Aya, an otiose being with no direct link to humans. The most important god for humans is Ayapo (lit: Aya's born). He is male and his shrine is in Biakpa, the village nearest Ohulusu, traditionally the place where Avatime first settled when they moved into the area. Ayapa has a wife, Gadze, whose shrine is at Gbadzeme. These two shrines are the most important shrines relating to the pantheon and rice cultivation rituals. In each of the other Avatime villages is a shrine to a god linked to the pantheon but the relationship among these other gods is obscure. There are other shrines in Avatime, often associated with natural features, but the gods and rituals associated with these shrines are not significant in rice cultivation rituals, although rituals for these gods may be timed to fit in with the rice calendar. One other series of shrines is important: that associated with the earth in its mystical aspect. In each village one clan, traditionally that thought to have settled on the village site first, is associated with the earth. One man from this clan is designated the earth priest. The priests for the pantheon together with those of the earth interact during the rice cultivation rituals. The fertility of rice cannot be separated from the fertility of the earth, nor can the fertility of rice be separated from the fertility and well-being of the Avatime people. The rituals for different stages in the cultivation of rice sometimes implicitly, and at others, explicitly, are concerned with the well-being of Avatime as a whole. Rice is ritually the most significant food in Avatime. It is eaten at life crisis rituals and other celebrations and there are three ways of preparing it. The least important, ritually, is to boil the grains. (This is done when other rice food is in preparation on the occasions when rice is pounded to dehusk it, roasted and ground into flour to make rice porridge.9) Life crisis and other celebratory rituals demand porridge. What is eaten with the porridge depends on the ceremony. In cultivation rituals and rituals associated with the pantheon, rice is made into lEflfklE0, a rich paste made from roasted rice flour cooked with water and palm oil. A further indication of the centrality of rice is that throughout its cultivation and consumption, rice has different names. In rituals it is referred to as amlobi. In the stages of its physical cultivation it is known as amuna: to plant rice is sJ or glo amuna, (lit: weed rice), to harvest it, pa amuna (lit: uproot rice). Whole rice grains for cooking are called kemimi. These are only indications of the importance of rice. Its fundamental significance can be gauged from the fact that the calendar for rice cultivation sets the pattern for the agricultural year. Rice cultivation rituals form a cycle: the end of one stage in the cycle 661</page><page sequence="4">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME marks the beginning of the next. The ritual 'new year' begins in June with rice planting while the last phase of harvest rituals permits the bush to be burnt and new farms to be made (in January and February), in preparation for the planting. No other crop in Avatime has so much ritual attached to its cultivation. Rituals for the cultivation of rice are the only regular occasions on which 'all-Avatime' is involved. No-one can begin to plant, harvest or eat rice until the relevant rituals have been performed. Planting Early in June each year the appearance of a particular constellation in the early morning sky indicates that it is time to prepare for rice planting. As soon as the constellation is seen word is sent to Biakpa and on the following Sunday the rituals begin. Before dawn, servers"' are sent from the shrines in all the villages to go and steal palm wine from those tapping. On their return, libations are poured to the gods and the remaining palm wine drunk. The following day, Monday, the gong-gong12 is beaten before dawn in all of the villages to tell people not to go to farm. The gods have been invoked and the bush is out of bounds for humans: the gods are there. These libations mark the 'sending of the gods to the land'. After two weeks the pantheon priests go to a sacred place in the bush outside the Biakpa village boundary to fetch the gods from the bush and prepare them for the rituals. The priests return to the village singing special songs and dancing to accompany the gods. These songs and dances, osoblisme, are sung to coax the gods back to their shrines in the villages. They are unique to the planting phase of the cycle. The gods are sent to the bush to prepare it for rice planting and then they are persuaded to return to their shrines in the villages. They are coaxed back to the villages with vsoblisoe songs and dancing and once there, the atmosphere must suit them: there should be no undue noise. (Deaths must be given special consideration). Two weeks after the gods have been lured back to the villages rituals are performed at Gadze's shrine and jsoblisve is danced. vsoblisoe is danced again on the following Wednesday, the day sacred to Gadze, and on the next Sunday the drum from Gadze's shrine is taken to Ayap 's shrine in Biakpa and the performance is repeated. Thus the culmination of the pre-planting rituals involves the union of Gadze and Ayap in Biakpa.13 The gods' blessing on the rice crop is sought. One year is over, they say, and it is time to begin again. The following day marks the end of the sacred time and the first day of rice planting. No-one in Avatime begins to plant hill rice before this time.14 These ceremonies serve to ensure the fertility of the rice. For two weeks after the planting rituals women are not allowed on the rice farms. Rice is the only crop grown in Avatime which entails any formal sexual division of labour. Yams, maize and cassava can be cultivated by both men and women. Rice cultivation too, is one of the few occasions where the members of the oku work together, and sisters' sons can also be called upon. There is no other crop grown for which communal labour is mobilised on a kinship basis. Rice is planted in July on land initially cleared in January/February. Often it is intercropped, usually with cassava. The dry rice is broadcast by the elder of the group. The rest follow and uproot any undergrowth. The rice is left to germinate in a protective bed of drying weeds. When the seedlings are visible and strong, women 662</page><page sequence="5">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME come to the farms and collect up the dead weeds, leaving the seedlings free to grow. Traditionally too, women do not harvest rice (done by uprooting handfuls of the rice) nor are they allowed at the threshing place. It is only when rice is brought into the confines of the village that women have anything to do with it. Within the villages rice is almost exclusively a woman's concern since rice is brought to the villages as food to be cooked and eaten. Cooking is fundamentally women's work. Harvesting By mid-November rice is ready for harvesting. Palm trees are uprooted to provide palm wine for the harvesting rituals. AyapY's priest must remain sexually continent from the time the palm trees are uprooted until the end of this phase of the ritual cycle. The main harvesting rituals take place on a Sunday,5 but on the previous Wednesday, the tapping place is consecrated for the main ceremonies. Libations are poured'6 and the tapping place is decorated with young palm fronds. The route from the village to the tapping place is marked with palm fronds. The main rituals for the rice harvest take place at Ohulusu, the traditional site of the first Avatime settlement. Ohulusu is a rocky clearing on the hills about two miles from Biakpa. The clearing looks out towards the highest peak in the area. As it is only visited for the rituals, the way to Ohulusu is overgrown and a path has to be cleared each year. The gong-gong is beaten in Biakpa and the pre-pubertal girls assemble in the market place at around noon. Each girl wears only waist beads with a red loin cloth threaded through and each carries a large and small calabash. Pantheon priests from all the villages should come and also the earth priest of Biakpa. The rituals begin with the pouring of libations at AyapY's shrine in the village to ask for a blessing on the harvest rituals. The priests and servers lead the procession of girls to the tapping place. Here, more libations are poured and each girl is consecrated by being given a mouthful of the god's palm wine to drink. The girls then go to a sacred stream where their calabashes are filled. Women of menstruating age are forbidden to cross this stream. The procession moves on towards Ohulusu, the servers carrying palm wine and the girls, water. Just before the place is reached the servers call out for permission to enter. The focus of the shrine is two black pots. The girls come into the clearing in single file. The first girl hands over her water calabash to the priest who uses the small calabash to take some water from it and put it into the pots. Some of the water from the pots is put into the girl's calabash and she goes to the edge of the clearing to bathe herself in the water. The symbolism is that of continuity; the girls are given some of the water already in the pots from previous years and they bring fresh water from the sacred stream for subsequent years. After bathing in the water, the girls are decorated with white-red-white clay all over their bodies.'7 Meanwhile Ohulusu is tidied by the servers; fallen branches and stones are moved to the sides of the clearing and the edges are decorated with palm fronds. Libations are poured. Each priest pours a libation, and in this way all of the Avatime villages should be represented. At Ohulusu the success of the rice crop, crucial to the planting rituals, is almost incidental to the content of the invocations. The emphasis is on people, on the success of Avatime as a group both at home in the rural areas and in the cities to which many go to look for work. The libations are the climax of the rituals and after this everyone prepares to leave. Ayapc's priest, the last to leave, makes a promise to return next year. The trip back to 663</page><page sequence="6">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME Biakpa is a time for fun. Farms en route can be raided for fruit with impunity, but as they approach the outskirts of the village, the girls form a single line and one of the servers takes the lead. The girls go straight to Ayap's shrine in the village, where the first three have the calabashes containing the fruit ceremonially removed from their heads by Ayap 's priest indicating an end to their sacredness. On the next day, Monday, harvesting can begin. Eating Although these rituals allow rice to be harvested, it cannot be threshed or brought into the villages until it has first of all been given to the gods to eat. Two weeks after the harvesting rituals, therefore, new rice is given to the gods. Again, the ceremonies take place at Ayapi's shrine in Biakpa and priests from all Avatime villages should attend. Ayapc's priest threshes a little of his own rice in preparation for the rituals. The rice grain is prepared and ground by post-menopausal women.'8 Some of the grain is roasted but a part must be left unroasted. Meanwhile the priest pours libations in palm wine at Ayapg's shrine asking the god's blessing on the rituals. A castrated black goat is consecrated with the clay marks and has cowries tied around its neck. Some of the unroasted flour is mixed with water in a calabash and it is used for libations in the shrine room. Ayap's priest sips the rice water three times and then gives it to the other priests and servers to sip. This is the first rice eating. The rice water is then sprinkled around the shrine room, the consecrated area outside and over the priest's granary. The rice can now be cooked and kEflf made. The male officiants do all of the cooking although the post-menopausal women who have prepared the flour look on, a reversal of secular roles. The consecrated goat is offered to the gods and taken inside the shrine room to be killed. As soon as it is dead'9 it is thrown outside and the servers bring wood for the fire, and ingredients and utensils for making lErfflk.2 At each stage of the cooking a small portion of food is offered to the shrine; unsalted meat, salted meat and finally, lfEfle. The priest and servers eat as do the old women who have helped. Rice can now be threshed and eaten throughout Avatime. Rice can now be eaten but the annual cycle goes on. Although one crop is safely harvested, preparations must be made for the next. One week after rice-eating another set of rituals is performed at Ayap3's shrine. Again, an animal is killed, lfEfk is made and libations are poured. Special leaves are brought and after the libations (in which the emphasis is on continuity), the leaves, together with salt, are put on to the fire. The smoke is a sign to everyone that the time for burning the bush has come;2' the beginning of another agricultural year. Towards evening, a server goes and sets fire to a small patch of the bush. These rituals mark both the completion of one phase of the cycle and the beginning of the next. Only after they have been performed can Ayapg's priest resume his normal life and sleep with his wife again, until the next rice-planting time. Other ceremonies The agricultural year in Avatime is organised around the cultivation of rice. Ayaps's priest gives permission for the bush to be burnt in December/January in preparation for planting although rice itself is not planted until July/August. Just as agriculture is 664</page><page sequence="7">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME focused around rice cultivation so other rituals also fit in with the 'rice calendar'. These other rituals vary from village to village but are often timed to take place immediately after rice eating, and new rice is often offered to these shrines. These rituals are village-specific, however. The rice cultivation rituals are the only regular Avatime-wide rituals. All Avatime villages carry out purification rituals: some, like Biakpa, twice a year, after both rice planting and eating, and some, like Amedzofe, only once a year after rice eating. The purification rituals take place on Tuesday after the planting or eating rituals. Purification rituals are carried out by pantheon and earth priests, and probably were much more elaborate in the past.22 They are carried out independently by the priests from each village. The purification ceremonies are known as 'binding the town', and involve the renewal of medicines designed to keep away ghosts and evil spirits. Purification ceremonies of a similar kind are widespread throughout the Volta Region. The significance here is that in Avatime, their timing has become dependent on the rice cultivation cycle. YAMS Although so much ritual significance is attached to rice cultivation in Avatime, rice is not now the most important subsistence crop. The more recent and easily cultivated maize and cassava have taken over as the most frequently consumed foods. Cassava (usually mixed with cocoyam, yam or plantain) is eaten as fufu . Maize can be roasted and ground and made into a porridge which is very popular. Both cassava and maize can be fermented and made into a dough which can then be cooked in various ways such as kenkey or banku. Maize and cassava have no ritual attached to their cultivation at all. Although they are still preferred as food, rice and yams (both indigenous crops) have been superceded as staples by cassava and maize. Yams do have ritual attached to their cultivation and consumption, but in a different way from rice. At the end of the first eating of rice rituals, permission is given for the bush to be burnt and for new farms to be made. This work begins in January and February, towards the end of the harmattan. Land in Avatime is under the guardianship of the minimal patrilineal descent groups (ikune). In each oku there is an elder, the okunete or kesanete.23 Each year before the farms are made, the okunete is responsible for the distribution of land among the oku members.24 Farming is done on a bush fallow system and land is used for 18 months to 2 years depending on the crops planted. The bush is burnt and the undergrowth cleared away. On farms all over Avatime yam mounds are made in readiness for the rains (March/April). Before planting begins on the new farms, some perform rituals to ask the blessing of the forebears and the spirits of the places where the new farms are to be made25. These rituals are typical of those performed whenever spirits of forebears of dead Avatime are to be appealed to. Although I have never witnessed one of these ceremonies, accounts state that they are fairly small scale affairs, often not involving more than one person. The essential parts of the rituals consist of pouring libations in palm wine to the forebears and the spirits of the place where the farm is to be made. An account from an elder of one of the Amedzofe clans tells of cooking lkfflI (with maize flour)26 at the farm site. This is an individual account and the only one from Amedzofe. An account from a group of Gbadzeme elders, including the chief, stated that the okunete pours 665</page><page sequence="8">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME libations on the land on a suitable Tuesday.27 Offerings including an egg, and roasted and unroasted maize flour are made to invoke the forebears to watch over the new crops. Thus, although rituals may be performed before new yams are planted these are on a very small scale and do not have relevance for Avatime as a whole. They are rituals carried out by the kinship groups most concerned with land-holding, the ikune. Yam eating rituals are performed on Fridays, the second of the 'days for the dead'. Yams must be given to the clan forebears to eat before they can be eaten by living members of the clan. Village chiefs do not participate as village chiefs in yam eating rituals, but only in their capacity as elders of particular clans. The yams are ready to be harvested from July onwards28 but they are not supposed to be brought into the villages until they have first been formally given to the forebears. Early in the morning of a suitable Friday, servers of the clan chiefs go to fetch water.29 The clan office holders and elders meet at the stool room30. The servers bring all that is necessary for the rituals and for cooking the yams. All those present have been warned to 'sleep well', that is, not to have sex the previous night. I have witnessed yam eating ceremonies in three of the clans in Amedzofe, and the ritual varies. In two of the clans, pieces of raw yam are offered to the stool first before any yam is cooked. In the third, this is not done. Generally, palm wine libations are poured to begin the ceremonies, to invoke the forebears to witness what is happening and to receive the new yam. New yams are cut up and put into a pot to boil. Eggs are also boiled. The food for the forebears is prepared first. Yam is mashed into two small plates and the yolks and white of the hard-boiled eggs are separated: each is mixed with one plateful of yam. This food is carried into the stool room and offered to the forebears. Meanwhile, servers set to work to mash the rest of the yams. When this is done they mix palm oil with the mashed yam and mould it into sausage-like shapes. Everyone present is given one or two of these to eat: only the elders and those who have 'slept well', can eat the food meant for the forebears. Every household in the clan, certainly the heads of each oku, is supposed to receive some of the mashed yam. After this the new yams can be brought into the villages freely3'. Yams in Avatime, then, have some ritual attached to their cultivation and consumption. But yam rituals are not for 'Avatime-as-a-whole', nor are they village wide. Yam rituals can be performed at different times by clans within the same village. Yam rituals are rituals for kinship groups. The clan is the widest group in Avatime within which agnatic descent is thought to be traceable. It is the elders of the clans who are the representatives of living Avatime and who must make sure that the spirits of clan forebears are well looked after before they eat yams themselves. The elders are responsible for clan morality and the continued well-being of clan members, both living and dead. CHIEFS AND POLITICS So far, I have deliberately avoided discussion of chiefs and regalia. There is considerable independent evidence that the chiefly and formal political structure of the groups in the Volta Region today is a fairly recent innovation. (Ward, 1949; Welman, 1924; Verdon, 1980). Chiefly genealogies are not extensive in Avatime and the names of warriors and leaders who lived before there were chiefs are remembered. It seems that chiefship and political structure in its present form were adopted by the groups in 666</page><page sequence="9">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME the Volta Region from Akwamu /Asante in the late 18th or early 19th century as a means of overthrowing the Akwamu. The Akwamu had exacted tribute from the small groups east of the Volta for at least a hundred years before the Volta Region groups united under the overall military leadership of Peki (an Ewe group) and defeated Akwamu in 1833 (Welman, 1924). Although Peki's influence subsequently waned, Asante-style political organisation persisted. It was adopted as it provided an efficient form of military organisation, both for attack and defence. Whatever the circumstances of its introduction, today in Avatime there are chiefs and an associated plethora of political offices. The paramount chiefs village is Vane32 and Vane is the head of the centre division in military organisation. Amedzofe is the head of the right wing and Biakpa of the left. The range of political offices in each village varies, and this, together with the use of a variety of Ewe, Akan and Ga terms for these offices is indicative of recent importation.33 Each village has a chief and there is a linguist, chiefs father and stool father for the village. Here, uniformity ends, however, and other officials are styled, for example, mankrado, asafoatse, sohefia and odikro. Village officials are drawn from all the clans in the village, although the chief, chiefs father and stool father always come from the same clan. Within the villages each clan has a chief and offices associated with the clan chiefship. Thus within each clan there is also a chiefs father, stool father, linguist and so on. Just as Avatime political offices resemble those in other areas of southern Ghana, so does Avatime regalia. Thus the symbol of chiefly power and chiefship in general is a stool which is normally kept in a special room away from prying and unclean eyes. However, in Avatime the stools are primarily clan stools, that is, within each village there is a stool for each clan symbolic of the chiefs position. Avatime does not have village stools separate from the clan stools. The stool of the clan from which the chief is selected doubles as the village stool if necessary, but there is no distinct clan/village stool division. This can be illustrated by an example from my own experience. As a stranger to Amedzofe, I was encouraged to 'choose a father', that is, to become formally associated with one of the clans. I avoided it as I did not want to become identified exclusively with one clan. However, this no-clan status had drawbacks. If ever I wanted to add a plea to libations poured in the village chiefs stool room I had to make it clear that I was appealing to the stool as the village stool and not as the clan stool. This distinction always caused confusion. When a village stool is needed then the village chiefs clan stool is used but there is no separate stool for the village of Amedzofe per se. A stool can be referred to as a village stool, but it is primarily a clan stool and a symbol of clan rather than village unity. This doubling of village chiefs' clan stools as village stools is found in all of the Avatime villages. Only in relation to the paramountcy is there any difference. There is a stool and regalia associated with the Avatime paramountcy which is distinct from the clan stools of Vane. These facts suggest that 'village' as political entity in Avatime is of relatively recent importance, and that the clans and their sub-divisions were formerly much more important34. Agnatic groups are the property holding groups in Avatime and are primarily important in social and political organisation within Avatime. Village-wide political organisation, village chiefship, can be seen as an extra layer, adopted in the first place as an expedient to establish independence from Akwamu and re-inforced and increased in its importance by the imposition of colonial rule. When the British took over the administration of the Avatime area from the 667</page><page sequence="10">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME Germans after the first world war35 their policy was directed to trying to re-establish, as they thought, a hierarchical and unified system of political organisation with Peki as its head. They maintained that the relative independence of the groups in the area was the result of German policy which deliberately fostered disintegration of large scale political organisation: a variation of 'divide and rule'. It seems more likely that what the British were in effect doing was establishing a single political system over the groups in the former German colony. Peki's influence, probably only recognised for military purposes at its zenith, had been declining since the Akwamu overthrow (Brown, 1974). With the imposition of colonial rule and especially British colonial rule (Indirect rule) chiefship assumed a new importance. Avatime, is a political entity, became part of a wider hierarchy. British colonial rule re-inforced the roles and authority of the chiefs. The chiefs, as far as the administration was concerned, were the official representatives of the subject peoples and those with whom the administration communicated. Colonial versions of order and regulation were disseminated through the chiefship/political structure, and chiefs, as representatives of the people, were given recognition in the colonial, and later, national political and legislative systems. Chiefs courts were set up and revenues were collected. Today, regional and national organisations of chiefs exist, having survived attacks from both civilian and military governments in Ghana. Now, Avatime is only part of a complex and hierarchical organisation which consists of local, regional and national levels. Anything within the formal state system which is pertinent to villages is administered through the chiefs. The following examples show that where Avatime is threatened by physical or mystical danger then it is the formal village/paramount chiefship structure that is brought into play to counteract the danger. In general, the effects of any force perceived to be external in Avatime are mediated by the formal chiefship structure. I have already suggested that the formal political structure was adopted and adapted from an Asante model primarily to counterbalance a threat from outside. When such a threat is felt then all Avatime is mobilised. Thus in 1927, when a long-standing quarrel with Tafi blew up into a skirmish, all the Avatime villages were concerned and the affair was conducted through the chiefship system (Brydon, n.d.) When a person dies a 'bad death'36 then word must be sent to all the other Avatime villages. Drums are beaten to call everyone back from farm: the bush should not be tampered with when the balance of good and evil forces has been upset. The chief (or representatives of the chief) and elders from all of the Avatime villages must go to the afflicted village to find out the circumstances of the death, to give advice and to sympathize. Only when visits have been received from each village can arrangements for burial continue. If an important person is openly accused of witchcraft in Avatime, then again, representatives from all Avatime villages should be present to assess the case, to decide on the compensation to the victim's family and to oversee the purification.37 Specific witchcraft accusations are not frequent in Avatime38 but people gossip among themselves and rumours of witchcraft are much more frequent. If a person is accused of being a witch then both accused and accuser are sent to an oracle. If the accused is found guilty then he or she must undergo purification. If they refuse, then they must leave. These occasions, when there is some 'external' danger, threaten the security of 668</page><page sequence="11">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME Avatime and involve the whole group. The village-based political organisation is brought into play to deal with forces outside Avatime control. Thus on a supernatural level, witches and the forces causing bad deaths are outside the-control of Avatime society, while on a more tangible plane, danger from military threat or laws and rules imposed by a colonial or national government are also outside the control of Avatime society. Intercession with these forces is impossible within the limited scope of the Avatime pantheon or kinship organisation. Witchcraft, the forces causing bad deaths and invasion threats are not susceptible to the control of the Avatime gods or forebears, and neither are the dictates of a national government. Thus chiefship, adopted as a military expedient, has come to fulfil other functions within Avatime, and with the incorporation of Avatime in Ghana, has increased in importance as it provides a framework for that incorporation. DISCUSSION In rice cultivation rituals the priests act as intermediaries between the gods and the Avatime people as a whole: the priests of the rice gods are not concerned with the secular division of Avatime into clans and ikune in the performance of planting or harvesting rituals, but only with the control of impersonal forces such as the weather, and with the well-being of Avatime. Since this is so, then there must be a representative of the pantheon in each Avatime village. Thus the annual performance of the rice cultivation rituals is homage to the gods and is thought to ensure the success of Avatime, both in terms of group continuity (fertility) and in terms of wealth and status of Avatime. The gods of the rice pantheon can be appealed to by individual Avatime at any time. An Avatime planning a business venture can ask the gods' blessing for success and the rice gods are appealed to by individuals for help with fertility problems. The importance of the rice cultivation cycle is that it is the basis for the Avatime agricultural calendar and also from the fact that other, probably recently introduced rituals (such as town purification) have been integrated with the rice calendar. Yam cultivation rituals are related to the aspects of the social organisation of Avatime centred on descent. It is difficult to over-emphasise the importance of descent and kinship in everyday life in Avatime. Residence and subsistence are largely determined by position within the descent system Mandatory life crisis rituals are the concern of agnatic descent groups.39 Within the villages, order is maintained in most cases by oku and clan elders. Kinship and descent also play an important role in supporting migrants to urban areas. Migrants usually maintain links to their villages: often they build houses for their retirement in their clan areas and descent group membership is ultimately asserted for migrants and villagers alike. Funeral ceremonies are performed in the oku area of the deceased and by members of the deceased's oku. The gods watch over Avatime, but they are not concerned with the more mundane aspects of human life: where people live, by what means they live and how they live together, that is, with social organisation. It is the descent groups that are largely responsible for maintaining social order in Avatime. Descent group forebears are the moral guardians of social order and the clan and ikune elders' authority is legitimated by virtue of their relationship with the forebears. Libations to forebears are supposed to ensure their continued benevolence. Avatime relations with their gods40 are encompassed by the cultivation of rice and 669</page><page sequence="12">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME the accompanying rituals, and the relationship between forebears and yams is similar. Yam eating rituals are the most important way in which the relationship between living and dead members of descent groups is expressed. Yam eating rituals are the only regular occasions on which the descent group has dealings with its forebears: they are the only regular means of communication. Avatime gods are the gods of the indigenous people, the Baya. The shrines of the pantheon gods are in special places: each village has a shrine to a god of the pantheon and the gods are often closely associated with specific geographical features. Gods can therefore be associated with 'place'. Rice cultivation rituals are the means by which the people have related to their place of settlement: they ingratiate themselves with the guardians of their environment. The people of Avatime today, claim, for the most part to be descendants of an immigrant group but the Avatime pantheon and rice cultivation rituals are of Baya origin. This makes sense if the gods are regarded as gods of place. The incomers wanted favourable and secure places for settlement and the benevolence of the gods was part of the search for favour and security. Rice cultivation and other rituals for the pantheon were adopted by the immigrants although they were part of the Baya cosmology. Yam cultivation, on the other hand, reflects the organisation of people into clans and ikune. They are rituals relating to a group of people who trace descent from one of the immigrants. Rituals for yam planting are variable and relatively unimportant. These are the rituals where Avatime appeal to the spirits of the place (where a yam farm is to be made) and to the descent group forebears for the success of their yam crop. Gods are not invoked. Yam eating rituals are much more important and these are exclusively descent group rituals: they have nothing to do with attachment to a specific place, only with the continued welfare of a definite group of people. Yam rituals can therefore be linked with people and their every day social organisation and more particularly, with the 'immigrant' social organisation which predominates today. Thus we can trace a pattern: GODS FOREBEARS I I RICE YAMS I I ALL-AVATIME DESCENT GROUPS (Place/Indigenes) (People/Immigrants) 'Rice' is the idiom in which relationships between Avatime and its gods are expressed. Forebears are responsible only for the well-being of their clan descendants. There is no eponymous Avatime forebear. Forebears are responsible for the maintenance of order in everyday life. 'Rice' and 'yams' complement each other as series of rituals relating to different levels of Avatime social organisation. But what of chiefs? It might be possible to add a third set to the above diagram along the lines: All- Avatime/Chiefs/Alien Forces. This has some validity: parallels can be drawn between it and the models based on the rice and yam ritual sets. Formal chiefship in Avatime is important in settings where external forces, either mystical or secular, are involved. Chiefship on the Asante pattern of state and village chiefs was introduced east of the Volta to counteract a specific external threat. The examples of chiefship in operation show that it is relevant to 'Avatime-as-a-whole' in a way similar to the rice cultivation 670</page><page sequence="13">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME rituals. There is a paramount chief for all Avatime and a formal head of the pantheon. There is also a shrine and a god linked with the pantheon in all of the villages just as there is a chief in each village. But the 'chief model is not complete. Chiefs have links with descent groups: village chiefs and officials are chosen because they are members of particular clans, and within the clan, the pattern of chiefs and officials is duplicated. Further, individuals can appeal to the gods by going directly to the shrine priests. Where there are appeals to village chiefs on behalf of individuals, the members of descent groups are mobilised as spokesmen in the supplicant's support. Thus, although the chiefship structure, like the rice rituals, is relevant for Avatime-as-a-whole, the chiefship structure is also integrated with the Avatime descent system in which the largest group is the clan and for which yam cultivation rituals have significance. We can propose therefore a composite model for the relationship between the power of the chiefs and social organisation. GODS., ,FOREBEARS - _ ALIEN FORCES ,- RICE-- CHIEFS -YAMS ALL-AVATIME DESCENT GROUPS Perhaps threats perceived as external to Avatime were formerly dealt with through appeals to the gods. It is reasonable to suppose that alien forces were always believed to exist. If chiefs are 'new' then there must have been some way of coping with alien mystical forces in the past. Since these forces are usually conceived of as naturalistic rather than anthropomorphic, then the ritual system involving the gods, the 'rice' set, is the most likely candidate. Chiefship, having been introduced as a military expedient, proved more efficacious in dealing with external threats, both of a mystical and secular order. Its position was consolidated by the recognition of chiefs by colonial powers. 'Chiefs' can therefore be thought of as a relatively new source of power and security in Avatime, competent to deal with new threats and contingencies and, as such, they have become integrated with both the 'rice' and 'yam' ritual sets. If chiefs are new then this can explain some of the differences between chiefs on one hand, and rice-and-yams, as ritual systems, on the other. I have suggested that the ritualisation of staple crop cultivation belongs to the indigenous Baya people and is essentially one way in which people aimed to come to terms with their environment. The pantheon gods are local deities. Rituals relating to yam cultivation reflect the resultant form of social organisation of the immigrants from Ahanta and the Baya remnants. They are important as a regular means of communicating with descent group forebears who are the ultimate arbiters of social organisation. Ritualisation of staple crop cultivation was adequate to deal with forces affecting the organisation of Avatime society: subsistence, group continuity and the maintenance of order within the group are covered by rice and yam cultivation rituals. I suggested earlier that witchcraft and other evil forces were formerly the domain of the gods. But where, increasingly, external forces were important (relations with Asante/Akwamu or colonial powers), then rituals focusing on the internal structure of Avatime, or promoting the success of Avatime within a defined area were insufficient. A supra- Avatime system was necessary. Chiefship was thus adopted and adapted. 671</page><page sequence="14">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME We can talk of ritualisation of staple crop cultivation or of rice and yam cultivation rituals, but we cannot discuss chiefs in these simple terms. Although chiefship has mystical and ritual aspects associated with it (in dealing with witchcraft for example), it is the fact that chiefship has proved adaptable and is instrumental in increasingly more political spheres that has ensured its importance today as an integral part of Avatime. I suggest that not only has chiefship become integrated with the other ritual systems, but that chiefship, with its wider scope, is subsuming the rice and yam ritual sets. Chiefs have a dual set of roles to perform, as both clan and village officials: the relationship between these two sets of roles is confused in some contexts. Chiefs are elected on the basis of being members of a particular clan, thus they have links with yam cultivation rituals and social organisation. There are obvious links between chiefs and the personnel and rituals connected with rice cultivation. On the rice eating day, a small portion of efiflfk is sent to the Biakpa chiefs, and in all the Avatime villages a little of the new rice is given to the stools (here the stools are being thought of as village stools). I suggested too that in providing the ritual idiom with which witchcraft and other evil forces are dealt, chiefship had taken over from the pantheon. But, despite the importance today of chiefs, rice still retains an important place in Avatime, Its 'calendar' is still the basis for the Avatime agricultural year and its success as a crop is still thought to be linked to the 'success' of Avatime in terms of fertility, health and wealth. In 1974 Avatime held a secular version of rice eating to mark the head of state's visit. This took the form of a durbar, very like Ewe yam eating festivals. It bore no overt relation to the ritual rice eating, which took place the previous December. Although chiefship might be the more instrumentally important ritual system for Avatime within Ghana, rice and yams still provide the basis for Avatime culture and social organisation. 672</page><page sequence="15">AGRICULTURAL CALENDAR OF AVATIME.

Bosman (1907) mentions rice as the most important crop along the coast after millet. 2 Darkoh (1970) is one of the few writers who has written on the groups to the east of the Volta. I am in general agreement with his views but am sceptical of the extent of influence he attributes to Guan groups. 3 I have done extensive fieldwork in Avatime, being based in Amedzofe but being known in all seven villages. The first fieldwork was done when I was a graduate student and held the Wyse Studentship in Social Anthropology (1973-74); the second field trip was funded jointly by the SSRC and the Smuts Fund, and the third, again jointly, by the British Academy and the University of Liverpool. I am grateful to all of these bodies. 4 Field notes in Nyangbo (1974) and Tafi (1979). Opoku (1970) mentions a rice festival in Akpafu, one of the northern Restvdlker groups. 5 See Brydon, 1976, Chapter 11, for a fuller discussion of Avatime social organisation. Clans are not dispersed in more than one Avatime village. Now they are composed of the supposed descendants of one of the original immigrants from Ahanta or of the descendants of those Baya who survived the immigrant intrusion. 6 Compare Verdon, 1980. Avatime, in this analysis is different from the Ewe polities Verdon discusses. 7 Women in Avatime also take chiefly titles: in each clan there is a woman chief, and each chief has a tsiame and other officers to help her. 8 Analysis of the current significance of Avatime cosmology is part of the subject matter of a planned book. The ideas present in this paper are an initial and perhaps, crude, stage in the analysis. 9 Imported rice is only ever boiled and eaten with stews: it is never roasted and ground. 10 Ltftfkl is very similar to the Ewe dish made with maize flour and known as dzemkple in Anlo and akpledzi among the northern Ewe groups. 11 These people are called abuba (sing.:abu) The word can take a variety of glosses including messenger, representative, servant. 'Server' seems to be an adequate translation for the purpose of this paper. 12 The gong-gong serves the function of the town-crier. 13 The )soblisxE dancing in Biakpa is overtly sexual in form. 14 Even the pastor does not begin to plant his rice before the ceremonies are finished. There is no restriction on planting imported rice (0. sativa). 15 Now, harvesting rituals are timed to take place on the second Sunday before Advent. 16 This is the first time palm wine is drunk from these trees. It is the very sweet new wine known as atsokJla. 17 These patterns of white/red/white marks are typical of the pantheon. For all rituals connected with the pantheon, the officiants have the marks daubed on their foreheads, temples and the arch of their left feet. They are signs of consecration. 18 Women only have responsibility for rice within the boundaries of the villages. Even within the villages, where the rituals are concerned, menstruation is highly polluting and only pre- and post- menopausal women can be involved. 19 The goat is killed by drowning: there is no blood shed. Inside the shrine room is a small hollow at the base of the shrine itself. This is filled with water and the goat's muzzle is held in the water until it dies. While the goat is struggling, those holding it ask the gods for favours and blessings of all kinds. 20 The stirrers normally used in cooking ifEflt or porridge are made from a hard wood in a specific shape. The stirrers used in cooking during the rituals are crudely fashioned from the spines of palm leaves. 21 No-one can begin to burn the bush until then. 22 Old people in Avatime spoke of their youth when on the eve of the purification rituals young people shot burning arrows as far as they could out into the bush, thus ridding the village of evil spirits. Coursey (1968) also mentions the use of fire in purification of villages prior to yam eating festivals among the Ewe. My fieldnotes (1979) on Tafi also contain an account of arrows shot into the bush prior to purification of the villages. 23 The suffix -nete can take a variety of meanings. It can mean owner, representative or key person in a ritual (as in the 'owner' of the ritual).Thus a priest is obo-nete, (obo means god), a herbalist is ovanete (kova means medicine/herbs) and a girl having a nubility rite performed for her is jkonete (ako means custom). Kesa is the Avatime word for land. 24 The areas around Avatime villages are divided up into named farmlands. Each oku and clan knows where its farmlands are and everyone refers to them by name. Women are entitled to farm on land of their natal ikune, but cannot pass on rights to this land. 25 I do not know if this custom is performed by everyone in Avatime. I have accounts of it from one clan in Amedzofe and from Gbadzeme elders. 26 Maize is the food usually offered to the spirits of the dead. It is offered in the form of flour. 27 Tuesday and Friday are known in Avatime as 'days for the dead'; bekpoliwe. Rituals involving</page><page sequence="17">RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME 675 forebears and ghosts must be done on days for the dead. Outdooring or any other ceremonies concerned primarily with living people are never performed on these days. 28 Because of Amedzofe's high position, the rains begin there earlier than in the valley. Amedzofe's yams are ready for harvesting in early July, while those of the villages in the valley are not ready until August or September. 29 Water for rituals is drawn from a sacred stream in each village. 30 For a fuller discussion of'stool' and 'stoolroom' see below. 31 This is fairly similar to the description of Nyangbo (Gagbefe) yam eating ceremonies in Coursey (1968). (Buku is yam in Nyangbo, in Avatime yam is kiku, pl.:bikube.) 32 The Avatime term for paramount chief is osie. This, in other contexts means a distant patrilineal relative at least two generations above ego. It does not mean grandfather. The Avatime word for village chief and clan chief is okusie. 33 Such terms as sohefia (Ewe), tsiame/okyeame (Akan) and mankrado (Ga). 34 Again this seems to be different from the pattern described by Verdon for Abutia and other Ewe- dome groups. 35 After the first world war, the German territories in Africa became Mandated territories of the League of Nations (subsequently, United Nations Trust Territories). German Togo was divided between the British and the French and Avatime came under British jurisdiction. 36 Bad deaths are deaths which occur unexpectedly, such as from snake bite, a lorry accident or drowning; circumstances which are not regarded as normal. 37 Where persons accused of being a witch they are not killed or banished if they agree to undergo a purification ceremony. This involves being stripped in public, having the head shaved and drinking the urine of a post-menopausal woman. 38 There have only been three witchcraft cases in the time that I have known Avatime (1974 onwards). 39 See Brydon 1976, Ch 11, for a discussion of the 'web of kinship' in Avatime. 40 I refer only to the pantheon gods here.</page><page sequence="18">676 RICE, YAMS AND CHIEFS IN AVATIME REFERENCES Bosman Willem 1907 A New and Accurate Description of the Coast of Guinea.

Dans cet article, on analyse et on compare la signification de la culture du riz et de l'igname chez les Avatime, un des 'groupes vestigiels du Togo', habitant l'est du Ghana. De nos jours, les Avatime affirment etre les descendants de migrants d'Ahanta ainsi que de la population indigene, les Baya. On montre que la culture du riz occupe une place cardinale dans la culture Avatime: la plantation du riz, la recolte et la premiere consommation ne peuvent avoir lieu qu'apres avoir accompli certains rituels appropries aux divinites Avatime. L'importance du riz est soulignee car c'est le cycle cultural de cette cereale qui regit l'annee agricole Avatime et la date d'autres rituels. Le riz, cuit de diverses manieres, est egalement la nourriture rituelle la plus importante chez les Avatime. On suggere ici que le pantheon, ensemble des divinites, dont les rituels relatifs a la culture du riz sont l'elment mediateur, est pertinent a l'ensemble des Avatime. Les rituels de culture du riz sont les seuls rituels reguliers pour tous les Avatime et sont fermement etablis dans le champ culturel indigene qui a trait au caractere local. La culture de l'igname fait l'objet de moins de rituels que le riz: ce rituel n'intervient largement que dans la consommation de l'igname. Les rituels relatifs a l'igname sont du ressort des groupes de filiation. Chez les Avatime, le groupe de filiation le plus large est le clan agnatique qui est aussi le groupe dont l'avoir foncier est le plus important. Les ignames nouvellement recoltes doivent etre offerts aux ancetres agnatiques avant d'etre consommes par les membres du clan. Ces rituels ne touchent pas l'ensemble des Avatime; ils sont lies aux groupes de filiation et a l'organisation sociale des immigrants. Enfin, on examine la notion de 'chef. La chefferie n'a ete introduite que recemment chez les Avatime, ayant ete adoptee pour des raisons d'ordre militaire a l'origine. Cependant, la position des chefs s'est consolidee dans la societe Avatime en raison de leur aptitude a faire face aux perils d'ordre mystique ou seculier exterieurs a la societe. On suggere que les chefs se sont integres au systeme des rituels du riz et de l'igname, et qu'en raison de leur competence particuliere devant certains 'perils' seculiers (c'est-a-dire, en fait, de leur competence dans le domaine politique actuel), ils ont acquis de nos jours une importance de premier ordre parmi les Avatime.</page></plain_text>
