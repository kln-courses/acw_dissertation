My method of reading Durkheim’s (1965 [1915]) The Elementary  Forms of the Religious Life recovers as his fundamental interest the following  question: How in collective life do we deal with ambiguity as a social phenom- enon? The social actor always needs ways and means to bear this burden as  something other than oppressive, for example, the conception of a self both finite  and infinite, both sacred and profane, both free and constrained. Durkheim chal- lenges the modern conceit that secular society supersedes the attachment to the  sacred by exposing the force of the sacred in any society. Durkheim proceeds  by formulating the social actor as an automaton and by expanding and enrich- ing the notion of automation to reveal it as having a capacity for a degree of  self-affection and affectivity that can be tapped as a resource in creative social  action. It is an impersonality towards ambiguity as an impenetrable structure that  makes such improvisational action possible as both automated, and yet capable  of change through reflective practices that expose such automation.

Ma lecture des Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse (1965 [1912]) d’Émile Durkheim récupère l’intérêt fondamental de l’auteur sous la forme  de la question suivante: Comment composons-nous, en vie collective, avec  l’ambiguïté en tant que phénomène social? L’acteur social a toujours besoin de  moyens lui permettant de supporter ce fardeau sans que cela soit oppressant,  par exemple, la conception d’un soi à la fois fini et infini, sacré et profane, libre  et assujetti. Durkheim s’oppose à la croyance moderne qui dit que la société  remplace l’attachement au sacré en exposant la force du sacré dans toute société.  Durkheim commence en considérant le contrat social comme un automate tout  en élargissant et enrichissant la notion de l’automatisation, la révélant ainsi com- me ayant une capacité pour un certain degré d’affection-pour-soi et d’affectivité  qui peut être exploité comme une ressource créatrice dans l’action sociale.

Each of Durkheim’s books  describes how fundamental ambiguity is expressed in different shapes of  this tension, between constraint and freedom, and the specific situations  of problem-solving each raises. In The Elementary Forms of Religious  Life (1965 [1912] hereafter, EFRL), Durkheim highlights the particular  solution of religion in this way. This paper is influenced by my reading of The Elementary Forms  as the analogical surface of a textual structure that makes explicit and  palpable another story, a story that formulates the place and force of the  symbolic order in social life. The symbolic order is typically identified as  a platitude without specificity, in ways that make its manifestation inevit- able and formless. Yet, if everything is “symbolic”; it loses its force and  symbolizing is viewed as the free and spontaneous action of constructing  meaning unfettered by restriction or limit. I propose that EFRL is de- signed to destabilize this modern truism by revealing how the symbolic  order can come to be seen dramatically, when contingent beliefs and  practices or conventions are treated as rites directed to affirming and  constituting the intelligibility of the order as if sacred and untouchable  and its meaning as profane. The limits of the work of ritualization reveals  the order as an inviolable and transitive bond disseminated between and  among members who relate to it by virtue of such a transfer of meaning  and of the social actor as if an automaton in the grip of social formulae  and their rites. Durkheim shows how this methodical silencing of ambi- guity allows for the symbolic order to carry on as if a machine applicable  to language, and its system of classifications as a ritual order organized  around the sacred imperative to hold the question of ambiguity in abey- ance through a network of interdictions. Of its actor conceived as subject  to such a machine, Durkheim requires an automated attachment that is  still capable of elevating itself on occasion, beyond resignation, despair  or docility, to a kind of ironic fortitude, sometimes heroic, but typically  driven by the comedic awareness of being condemned to eternal life.  For Durkheim, society is a machine that, in the idiom of Plato, writes  upon the souls of speakers (Gane 1983). In EFRL, religion serves as a  ruse to allow us to conceptually engage the tension between the sacred  and profane in language; in the best sense, it might position the modern  </page> <page sequence="3"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             569 subject to appreciate such ambiguity as both limit and incentive in hu- man conduct.  In contrast to the social actor as a “player,” Durkheim conceives of  the symbolic order from the position he imagines for an insider driven  to embrace its legitimacy without reserve, as if an imperative manifested  at the level of the corporeal. Durkheim’s conception of an automated  attachment to society still enables the actor, viewed as such, to reinvent  him/herself aesthetically within such limits by experimenting with dif- ferent modes of playfulness oriented towards the ritualized manner and  means of disguising the secret of the abyss that social life projects and  perpetuates as an inherent consequence of its ontological constitution. The third party here, the orientation to ambiguity as an unstated and  persistent field of application disclosed as the gaze to which Durkheim’s  theorizing answers, makes reference to society as a writing machine (in  ways that can provide for biology as another speech) and reveal its limits  in contrast to the social. This gaze can empower a degree of reflective- ness upon the social order in a spirit of objective irony (Baudrillard 2006  [1984]), by making it possible to see comedic potential in views of cere- monial devotion to society, revealing the social order as if both corporeal  and social in its hold upon the member. Durkheim rebuts the modern  social constructionist advance of viewing the social actor as the player  of a game, by conceiving of such an actor as if an automaton possessed  by the drive to be possessed by society itself. The social actor is a game  player only from the perspective of a detached outsider to its ways, but  on the inside is necessarily seen as a subject driven by society to possess  it and be possessed by it as if a puppet (Zamir 2010). In this way my theorizing continues to develop as its voice, the com- mitment to explore and experiment with the aesthetic implications of the  prose of inquiry in various ways, from using the example of voice, ven- triloquism, and the dramatic actor (Blum 2001), to reformulating Sim- mel’s concept of adventure as an erotics of speaking (Blum 2003: 282- 283). I do so to realign the notion of analogy as a practice in writing and  speaking (Blum 2008), transforming Wittgenstein’s usage of “seeing-as”  (Blum in 2011b), and applying this to the relation of body to mind (Blum  2011a: 191-212). Also addressed are aspects of the trajectory of desire  in speech. Thus, this paper continues to think about theorizing as a sub- versive gesture within speaking, always engaged by the need and desire  to expose and develop ways and means of creatively innovating with  respect to the automated relationship to any normative order one inherits,  and to carry out such a project in qualitative analyses of cases together  with the ethical challenges they might elucidate. </page> <page sequence="4"> 570 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 the Book and itS reading  Reading a work is not a self-evident mechanical operation, since reading  is part of a relationship, and the book is much more than a tangible and  simple object or thing like a stone. In my view, the imagined intersec- tion between a book and its reading does not deserve questioning that  asks where the reading begins and ends in relation to the author as in  the question that asks what belongs to Durkheim and what belongs to  the reading of Durkheim as if reading and rewriting is modeled after  property and theft. Thus, I am not much interested in questions that ask  “What belongs to me and what belongs to Durkheim?” for I take this  book and any such as a movable feast. This does not exclude our being  able to pose questions such as what is a good or bad way to eat from this  table or what are the conditions for a good or bad reading? That is, the  postal model of a relation of author to reader risks skipping over the way  in which the relationship orients in practice to the convention of reading  that accomplishes what is read in the manner of making — or poesis —  in the Classical sense, that produces the reading as an event. In making  the book, the author does considerable interpretive work not infrequently  obscured by a produced textual surface. Such an approach to reading  (conventional in the humanities) views a reading of EFRL as an eventful  accomplishment about making sense of what is given. For example, in  the way that Eric Auerbach (1953 [1946]) examines representations of  reality throughout history, we can treat any approach to EFRL as part  of the discourse on the representation of reading and specifically, of the  book. As Rancière puts it, First, there is something given, a form that is provided by sense...Second,  the apprehension of this form is not only a matter of sense; rather, sense  itself is doubled. The apprehension puts into play a certain relation be- tween what Kant calls faculties: between a faculty that offers a given and  a faculty that makes something out of it. For these two faculties the Greek  language has only one name, aesthesis, the faculty of sense, the capacity  to both perceive the given and to make sense of it (2009: 1). In this respect, if the book is the given, there are different ways of re- lating to the book, different ways of developing the capacity to perceive  and make sense of the book, and working through this relationship.1  1. Previously, I (2011a: 29-47) followed Wittgenstein in speaking of this rela- tionship as aesthetic in terms of its capacity to associate and connect disparate  and apparently unrelated items, figures, terms, ideas, as in associating one to  an other in a way that must underlie any act of intelligibility (see the discus- sion in Blum 2003:14-18). </page> <page sequence="5"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             571 Secondly, what is made, say as the book that is The Elementary  Forms, is absolutely necessary for this approach because seeing the book  as making can only be done by examining it after it is made as its vari- ous representations. In this sense, whatever we, or anyone, says of EFRL  depends upon a method of reading, a method much like the fabled social  fact, external and coercive, that Durkheim (1938 [1895]) identifies in his  earlier work. This makes the method of reading both coercive and exter- nal, and yet an occasion, perhaps, for revisiting a book because what is  made and established as given can be (re)made in many ways. This is to say that our method of reading, in acknowledging its oc- currence as a social fact, must make its oriented character central in the  exposition. This further suggests that reading EFRL is a way of seeing  EFRL; that “seeing-as” is an aesthetic process and not simply a “look- see” transaction. This becomes apparent in treating the most simple con- dition, such as the status of Durkheim’s words, whether propositions or  matters of facts that he believes or not, or even more, whether we can  say that Durkheim has an unconscious and that his words might escape  what he can say or think of them. All of this is to propose in this paper a  focus upon Durkheim’s position as author, the question of his authorship,  its aesthetic and ethical resonances that always complicates the simple  view of an author-subject speaking directly to a reader-object about an  external thing such as the tangible product of a book (cf. Leo Strauss,  Kojeve, Bakhtin, etc.). Whether or not we subscribe to the notion of an  unconscious, our method proposes that the relationship that is reading  and writing is always grounded in the material practices of co-speaking  that remain often unspoken and decisive grounds for what is said. My  method implies that a strong reading of Durkheim is not one that seeks  to accurately represent whatever he might have had in mind in writing,  but tries to expose the authorship he presupposes as if it were a kind of  regime of representation in which ambiguity is inescapable for both the  author and reader. Approaching a text, as a text, means acknowledging that it presents  itself by positioning the materiality of discourse before consciousness  (Cohen 1994: 5, 7-8, 18). Strangely enough, the materiality of discourse,  even as the unconscious or foreign intruder that it is, comes alive in  Durkheim’s work in the image of corporeality animated by automation  and habituation in ways that reveal language as a social fact, external,  coercive and generalized. Language, as if body and the drive of speech,  make reference to the elementary form of the symbolic order as the ma- chine driving automated speakers to leave untouched the ambiguity of  their words and deeds and to systemically expel the foreign intruder.  Religion itself can be used to show this well, functioning here as a cru- </page> <page sequence="6"> 572 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 cial matheme. While Durkheim affirms that the “principal subject of the  book” is “The Elementary Forms of the religious life,” he states that the  “secondary subject of research” is the “genesis of the fundamental no- tions of thought” (see his annotated description of Contents EFRL, 5).  So now I suggest that the most important matter to consider in the au- thorship concerns the relation between this contrast that Durkheim calls  his primary and secondary subjects, what we might call his two stories.  We can hear the story of religion that he calls primary as his way of mak- ing reference to the immediate or accessible surface that is really sec- ondary (in the sense of derivative), while the other, the story of thought,  can only be the primary subject. It is necessary, I contend, to reverse  Durkheim’s sense of primary and secondary because the “fundamental  notions of thought” must ground and precede the subject of religion that  he calls “the principal subject of the book.” As Aristotle says, because  what is first for us (the book, its representation) is not first in nature  (thinking the book, orienting to the convention), we must reorient to the  contrast in another way.  Thus, the method of reading employed here must not only see the pri- mary and secondary stories differently than as stated by Durkheim. Such  a hierarchy cannot serve analytic interests seeking to neutralize the op- position itself by joining religion and thought in the figure of a reflective  relationship to religion (as the primary story of the book). This reflective  way remains in accords with Durkheim’s discussion of the totem as the  locus or place of mutual affinity and attachment that must focus ensuing  discussion. This identifies the topic of religion (as totem) as primary in  the way of a conversational opening or clearing, but secondary in the  way any such beginning must be unformed or implicit in relation to an  end it anticipates, foreseeing the real (primary) object of concern to be  the fundamental, riveting, and elementary matter of concern, namely the  relationship of thought to religion. If this relationship is what is primary,  then it can only be explored by inspecting the various and diverse ways  it is represented in a discourse, which is secondary in the way discourse  stands to what grounds it, but primary in the way that discourse mater- ializes, constituting the place of our beginning. So, Durkheim’s ruse is  this: to overthrow the very distinction between primary and secondary  with which he begins by saying that this “either-or” distinction prevents  us from seeing that one or the other is not primary or secondary because  thinking religion, the thought of religion, must be primary and what is  secondary are the different representations of this relationship that come  to view. This focus on the status and implications of Durkheim’s authorship,  on the imperative need and desire to supply a foundation for what is first  </page> <page sequence="7"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             573 and immediately given in the discussion of religion as a topic, animates  his desire to work through that discourse in order to supply a foundation  for what is without foundation, promising to reveal that very desire for  foundation, to be the elementary concern of this work and, we might say,  of Durkheim’s oeuvre as well. diStinguiShing and ColleCting We can begin to see that Durkheim’s ruse of using the concept of reli- gion to disclose the elementary form of the reflective life, simply plays off  the necessary pretense of conceptualization itself, to speak about what really  matters. Yet, concepts are to be treated playfully, in my view, for they in- volve ways we have learned to talk about distinctions and distinguishing,  which is what really matters. And so Durkheim can be read as saying that  what is elementary to an oriented life is distinguishing, putting together  what seems apart and discriminating between what seems together. This  requires both imagination and discrimination as actions that are necessary  but not sufficient; we can see this clearly in the example of religion because  it vividly brings into view these elementary forms for all humankind. To  wit, imagining and distinguishing are necessary forms, in ways we have  come to recognize as metaphysics. Durkheim’s implication that the elemen- tary structure of social life is aesthetic in this sense, is resonsant with Lacan’s  conception of the (potentially) delusional foundation of the social (Miller  1991). This permits us to reveal the symbolic order as a ceremonial order,  organized around ritual interdictions, grounded in a classification of sacred  and profane orientations to the world, and hence appreciate the problematic  and fundamentally ambiguous relationship to meaning that must reside,  typically as untouched and unspoken, as its core. In short, Durkheim uses  the ruse of a conceptual analysis of religion, to disclose The Elementary  Forms of an oriented relationship to life, as metaphysical (as delusional  or not). He does so in ways that remain to be developed, explicated, and  actualized in relation to the contingent features of situations which they  inherit and reshape, features he called totemic (Blum 2011a: 194-251). We can appreciate the link between the elementary structure and “de- lusion” when we understand the unconscious as elementary and language  as necessarily passing through interpretation. This makes reference to  the fundamental structure of “seeing-as” as the elementary character of  language. In precise Lacanian terms, “we should work on comparing  the formation of the unconscious and the elementary phenomenon. The  validity of this comparison rests on the concept of structure, which is the  same whether in an enormous text or a single page, since, as such, it is  </page> <page sequence="8"> 574 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 present in every single way” (Miller 2009: 11). For Miller, the “phenom- ena of signification”(ibid.: 20) is constitutively a problematic or perplex- ing linkage for people; it is “the normal situation of the human being... as every subject is confronted by having to decipher a signifier” (21).  If “the signifier alone is what is elementary, that is to say that one does  not know what it signifies” (21), fundamental ambiguity is elementary  and so too then are its consequences: interpretation, its hallucinatory  potential and the human-all-too-human anxiety of having to deal with  this foundational, elementary ambiguity (Blum 2011a: 215-233; Ronen  2000; Heidegger 1962 [1927]). This recognition is perfectly in accord  with the recognition of the intrinsic tension between finite characteriza- tion and its infinite perplexity, inherited from Plato and through Hegel  and beyond (Benardete 1991; McHugh 2005; Mansfield 2010; Žižek et  al. 2011).  The act of distinguishing first shows itself in the vision of an ines- capable totemic system of classification that we seem to inherit since  anything and everything we say and do is made possible by the ways in  which we “see in advance” whatever we treat as a beginning (Heidegger  1962 [1927]). The filtering involved in seeing in advance, confirms the  social ground of distinguishing and interpretation. That is, we are in posi- tion to distinguish because we are united as co-speakers whose capacity  to “see in advance” is shared and mutually recognized as what it is, as the  practice of seeing in advance, that somehow links us in a kind of virtual  presence and solidarity that enables us to see the same in different ways.  totemiSm Durkheim is often accused of anthropomorphism, in personifying so- ciety as if a being, in ways that have been said to anticipate totalitar- ian conceptions. This does not have to follow. Personification haunts  discourse in the shape of distinctions that by themselves have no value  until they are developed. Abstractions of generality are often accused of  being ideological for not specifying what they call “a subject position,”  as if the distinction masks its divisible and plural character, but this is  a fatal flaw in concrete thought. The abstraction of distinctions takes on  life, as Hegel says, through development, explication, and actualization,  three different names for the oriented action of speaking. Here, I repeat  Durkheim’s position, in restructured form to demonstrate its syllogistic  character: </page> <page sequence="9"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             575 If concepts were only general ideas they would not enrich knowledge a  great deal, but if before all else they are collective representations...they  correspond to the way this very special being, society, considers the things  of its own proper existence (EFRL: 483). For Durkheim, concepts are being proposed (in contrast to their use as  “general ideas”) as images or reflections of society, and less as “content”;  i.e., we are instructed to first consider the collective (which includes we  who “consider”) as having ways/methods. We are used to this because  we typically describe the ways of collectives as their customs, practices,  and the like. But, he proposes that we “consider” the concepts of the col- lective as parts of its ways. This was revolutionary as long as “concepts,”  and their institutionalized scrutiny, were interpreted as part of a division  of labour that could only sustain a view of concepts as “general ideas”  and not as customs. For example, if we think of the notion of “truth” as a general idea, we  might discuss its aspects, conditions of use, methods of evidence, verifi- cation, and the like. But if we think of truth as a “way,” custom, method,  or even, dare we say, as a formula, it can be seen as self-descriptive in  another sense. For example, the notion of truth can be seen as showing  what a collective valorizes or admires, what it counts as proper, signifi- cant, noteworthy; what it includes or excludes as a matter of indiffer- ence; how it weighs its words, deeds, and people and events accordingly.  “Way” perhaps also refers to a collective’s narratives, memories, histor- ies, how the genuine and spurious are calculated and respected. Since  Durkheim, Wittgenstein among others have taught us how the concept  of truth is not only an occasion for epistemological concern, but binds  people together in collective life as those who are subject to an order  and its shaping, in ways that invite them to take it on as their own. Durk- heim’s referents thus anticipate what Lacan terms “imaginary.”  Durkheim’s claim that such functions of collective representations  are more fundamental than the vision of the concept understood as a  general idea, is anticipated dramatically in Hegel (1874 [1830]: 52-53).  For Hegel, the way truth is discussed in philosophy, it is constituted as  so many answers to the way we (the collective) “considers the things  of its own proper existence,” as a true friend. This in turn invites us to  consider how the concept (truth) mirrors how the collective regards the  meaning of friendship itself, or of many social actions, as real, genuine,  fallen, discrepant and the like. Even more, we come to understand the  communicative nature of truth through the discourse which the “gen- eral idea” collectivizes through the distinctions of oriented action that  bind and constrain us and are visible in our ordinary discriminations and  </page> <page sequence="10"> 576 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 opinions as for example in censorship and its range of designations (e.g.,  error, obscenity, conspiracy, libel, and hypocrisy), distinctions that are  each and all intelligible as manifestations of what we share as subject to  the collective machine despite our differences. In this way, Durkheim’s contrast of “concept” as “general idea” and  communicative form, needs to be reversed because the “general idea” of  truth resides in and as its communicative character. The concept of truth  is “as if” a totem that binds together those who bear its name (i.e., who  use it), marking them as related by virtue of this, even in their differ- ent views and interpretations. The concept is as if a bridge transferring  meaning among and between persons, rendering them common in some  general sense (as “members”) and yet also aware of being more. We  might consider the way truth is reputed to be done in China in contrast  to Western society. The moral of this story, long familiar to readers of  Wittgenstein and Austin, is not that there is a “pre-theoretical” level of  life prior to reflection, but that ordinary language is the home of the  “concept,” or in Simmelian terms, life and form belong together. What  begins to emerge in Durkheim’s maxim, is that the collective orients to  a concept in ways that can elucidate its varied functions in life, like the  doing of many other matters that are normally occluded. As a “general  idea,” truth might be seen as part of epistemology or ontology, but with  Durkheim’s maxim we go further by inquiring into the ways in which  these practices themselves say something about collective life (for ex- ample, its view of knowledge, specialization, territoriality). Of course,  a general idea regulates not only through concrete interdictions such as  in the way sociology typically speaks of norms, but through aesthetic  and/or grammatical features of action and intelligibility that are more  fundamental and enable any one to see something as what it is, that is, to  accomplish intelligibility. Thus, truth can be seen to function totemically, when its general idea  is translated into conceptions of oriented actions that are used as part  of the round of life. As grounded in a totem, the web of the significa- tion of truth serves as a starting point which, as inherited, is invested  with affective connotation in varied ways and can be pursued as such an  order that is organized around ritual interdictions. In pursuing the com- municative function of the word, Durkheim’s strategy requires him first  to ask how “the name” (say, truth) is put together or assembled as if a  composition (in the spirit of Garfinkel’s ethnomethodology), that is, how  truth is done in life.  This doing of truth is never an innocent beginning. It is always de- rived and embedded in a network of inherited assumptions that the in- quirer, as together and apart, as two-in-one, as member who theorizes  </page> <page sequence="11"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             577 and theorist who draws upon membership, treats the detail of a self- referential order as emblematic. The theorist treats the actor as one who  is exhibitionistic in just this sense, as if oriented to produce what the  theorist requires, as if an automaton, ruled by the need and desire to  respect such an order in orienting to it and being governed by its ex- pectations, putting its accomplishments into practice through courses of  action. Yet, the totemic function of truth can only be a beginning for  inquiry because the self-referential focus of any such order can only be  closed; usage only affirms the convention or ways and means of doing  whatever the concept recommends. Bergson”s comment on comedy is  apt here: “There we have rigidity over again, clashing with the inner  suppleness of life. The ceremonial side of social life, must, therefore, al- ways include a latent comic element which is only waiting for an oppor- tunity to burst into full view” (Bergson 1956 [1900]: 89). This is where  the rigidity of “something given” conceals the “inner suppleness” of life  in the inelastic name-of-the-concept-as-totem, and where the “bursting  forth” of the vitality of the concept is only intimated in a way that invites  working-through and developing some sense of an elementary structure  of ambiguity that the concept emblematizes.  Thus, the relationship to ambiguity can always be “opened up”  through disciplined (closed?) reflection working through the limits of  such usage by topicalizing this border itself, by creating ethical colli- sions or routine cases of interpretive conflict, in ways meant to dramatize  the very question of the border as the matter of interest. In this sense,  ambiguity is treated unambiguously as a research phenomenon in ways  meant to expose this contradiction as the basis of social life, its Other- ness. A research study never “closes” ambiguity but makes it appear as  the unambiguous focus of interest in the particular example. Simmel is prescient in the respect. He reinstates concepts that have  become abstracted from their everyday life and situated in specialist vo- cabularies (such as truth, knowledge) by seeing them as part of mundane  problem-solving when social actors try to resolve contradictions that  these oriented actions release, for example, the possible attempt to know  (with absolute certainty) the other person or even oneself. Truth and fals- ity, knowledge and error, become part of our social currency, topics and  resources that establish (presuppose) the relatedness of all who “bear”  their names (all who use these concepts). This web of significations, or  symbolic order, becomes problematic when the peculiar understandings  it defers or holds in abeyance are exposed on any occasion as accidents  made to appear to and for us as necessities, exposing the fragility of our  very notion of need and desire. Concepts, then, can be seen as if totems,  that is, as symptomatic when we examine them in terms of their com- </page> <page sequence="12"> 578 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 municative function by asking how the “general idea” is used in collect- ive life and to what purposes it seems to be put. Though this rudimentary  approach operates under the auspices of the ordinary language maxim  that meaning is use, it only starts in this way in order to begin to examine  the discourse that the concept organizes as if a locus of collectivization. the elementary Situation If we think of our distinctions as conceptions, we might look to Durk- heim’s choice of using simple societies (“primitive aboriginals”) to lay  bare the elementary problem of the concept. Although Durkheim speaks  empirically about clans, tribes, and primitive religion, I will use his work  as a template for formulating the social problem of representation as an  elementary form of distinguishing. Durkheim moves through the following steps: “In the first place, the  individuals who compose it (say the group or society) consider them- selves united by a bond of kinship, but one which is of a very special na- ture. This relationship does not come from the fact that they have definite  blood connections with one another; they are relatives from the mere fact  that they have the same name” (EFRL: 122). This is similar to the notion  of a primal scene I have described in the case of the original relation of  parents and child(ren) united externally by the name (Blum 2011a). Any  act of distinguishing makes reference to the self-understanding of affinity  relating those oriented by the distinction. The relations between people  are mediated by a third thing, a name, which in bearing establishes them  as related to one another. Let us say that individuals consider themselves  united by a social bond created through having the same name, rather  than by particular characteristics. Having the same name is eventful, not  in the sense of a signifier which might be arbitrarily connected to a signi- fied, but as an object of desire that makes eventful its use and application  in any particular case. Distinction appears first as the eventfulness of  having the same name and in this way marks the social bond in a primor- dial sense. Just as people are collected by name as relatives, distinctions  collect members by name that are the same and those that are excluded  as other. Weber calls this mediation being “mutually oriented”; rather  than viewing this as a psychological description of “interiority”, it can  be understood as an ontological register of usage (of using the common  name). This is a sociological version of the old philosophical argument  against a “private language.” Durkheim uses the notion of the social bond figuratively to stand for  bonding itself without respect to how the bond is expressed in the col- </page> <page sequence="13"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             579 lectives we come to differentiate as “society,” “group,” “organization,”  or the like. What is essential to the social is the relation of the name to  what it names through the energy and binding that maintains differences  just as it collects them together, hence Durkheim’s attention to theoriz- ing collective representations via the concept of the totem. This replays  the unexplained attachment of members to and for one another in the  primary scene, and to the death of the referent (of anything more than  the communicative character of the name). The enigma of unexplained  and unresolved ambiguity is then two-fold, traumatic as negative, and  as positive incentive, serving as a ground and framework for action and  life. Perhaps this is a vision of what Nancy (2000 [1996]) calls the “to- getherness or common as such,” the elemental bonding or being-with  evoked by “community.” Durkheim uses the figure “society” to stand for  the metaphor of the social, the symbol of the bond that can be differently  actualized in specific kinds of collectives such as families, clans, tribes,  or even modern social organization. Durkheim’s concept of “society”  is thus similar the Hegelian notion of the “concrete universal” i.e., as  actualized in people’s activities. We do not know if the name creates  the bond or if the bond determines the name (we cannot recover such  an origin): what we do know is that we are “thrown” into the world as  those who awaken to the (social) fact that they relate (they are relatives)  by virtue of the name and are named the same by virtue of the bond. We  are not awakened to our common characteristics, to our social contract,  to our consensus, or agreement upon some specific matter of fact, but to  binding itself and all that this implies. Durkheim then continues to say: “All who bear this name are mem- bers of it for this very reason; in whatever manner they may be spread  [differentiated] they all have the same relations of kinship with one an- other” (EFRL: 13). Despite the differences which might come to mark  individuals, they are members (mutually oriented) by virtue of bearing  the same name; so, they are both One and Many, with respect to the way  the one name collects many differences and with respect to the way the  name separates those named from all those with different names. Yet if the name makes reference to the primordial distinction gener- ated by the constitution of the social — the social bond — it still seems  a symbol or word that represents the body of the group abstractly. If the  group is to distinguish itself as a group it must be through its action of  distinguishing. The relation of the name to the bond remains abstract  (dead) unless we understand it as mediated through the actions of being  “mutually oriented” (Weber 1947). As a name, the distinction or signi- fier remains inert until it is animated by those who are relatives, and the  relatives become animated only as they imagine the signifier as offering  </page> <page sequence="14"> 580 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 this promise. The name designates profane characteristics or aspects of  the world while at the same time connoting the social bond that unites  those who bear the fate of such designation. For example, if greetings  are registered in nods, tipping the hat, and a range of salutations and eva- sions, these indications remain profane until they can be oriented to so- cial practices that reveal the binding character of gestures themselves as  a matter of fundamental ambiguity. The sacred character of a gesture is  inseparable from its referential detail, but it must be separated in socio- logical reflection that comprehends their “existence” as both One and  Many. If the name mixes both referential detail and connotative implica- tions in a way that is profane, every discrimination activates and brings  to view the intermingling of borders that need be separated to sustain the  integrity of the social bond. Durkheim introduces the idea of the totem: “In regard to the word  totem, we may say that it is the one...employed to designate the sort of  thing whose name the clan bears” (EFRL: 123). Any distinction might  seem to be arbitrary or happenstance, but it does show (non-hypothet- ically) the bond between “relatives” who distinguish in this way, and  so, in a sense, as related by virtue of the distinction. The ambiguity of a  distinction that withdraws in the face of the force of its profane referen- tial detail remains present as the connotative “aura” haunting this detail  in its every application. The totem then, is nothing other than a figure of  speech, a metaphor, for the signifier. This is the heart of Durkheim’s ruse.  The indistinction of the signifier must be a distinct beginning or focus of  attention in collective life for those who will be engaged by it and use it  in their different ways, making this very indistinction a riveting focus of  social life. Every indistinct distinction shows the distinctiveness of those  for whom it is indistinct; every intangible matter shows its tangibility for  those to whom it is intangible; every object of conflict and dispute shows  its relevance to those for whom it is a contentious matter. They might  disagree wildly but persist as relatives by virtue of being in position to  disagree about what unites them. Durkheim discovers the remarkable  “social fact” that indistinct contents are dramatic affirmations of the dis- tinctiveness of those for whom they are indistinct. Durkheim’s discovery  of ambiguity as a social force is a secular version of the “word” as a gift  of grace. As a gift the word itself is a condition offered as given which  we can let lie or redeem in action as an offering that invites development. Using a distinction is a way of doing or acting (participating in  “existence”) that in being done as it is, distinguishes (participates in “dif- ference”) as a means of showing togetherness or the common as such;  in distinguishing, it separates those who distinguish from those who do  not. The name is binding in this sense, just as I remain bound to those  </page> <page sequence="15"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             581 who I am now addressing in the face of all of the differences this might  arouse. In this way, the things distinguished or designated “resemble”  the name the group bears; that is, the distinction in being made is done  in the way of those who are bound by it, by those whose use of it is  disclosed as “mutually oriented”, because it is done according to a way  that “resembles” binding and so, those who are bound by distinguishing.  Distinguishing resembles the social because it discloses the action of  binding in the material form of those who are bound together: distin- guishing “resembles” mutually oriented action (it is not the same, but an  avatar, of binding).  Yet, if the name of the group is itself an image of the social bond of  the group, that is, if the distinction is not the social bond but an image of  it, distinguishing is not identical to binding, neither in its entirety nor in  its “totality,” but in one specific and differentiated way in which bind- ing is expressed. What Plato calls the separation and blending of forms  tells us that usages point to separable forms (contents) different in kind  (we would not analyze different specific contents in the same way), and  to separate forms that must be blended (different contents despite their  differences are expressions of bonding). This points to the fertility of the  social bond as if a gift of grace. In the same way, the totem (say, the material distinction marking  “religion” as a concept) is an image of the thing it designates; in being  constituted, it selects and abstracts from a complex sense that it intuits.  And so, it imagines the thing that is religion by abstracting and selecting  from everything thinkable about religion. These are the different “levels”  which Deleuze and Guattari (1994) speak: the openness of the whole,  and its relationship to the “closed set” in the way the totemic discourse is  closed and open at the same time. Totemic discourse is closed by virtue of  the interactions it “totemically/emblematically” posits and orchestrates  (its representation of the dissemination of contents), and open by virtue  of narratives that expose the ground of such circulation in the fundamen- tal ambiguity of the mobile connotative surplus. That is, the totem is an  image of “the thing” in two senses. First, the totem is an image of the  thing as a re-presentation of ritual action as, say, the thought of religion  is an image of religion that is not the same as the religion it imagines.  Second, the thought of religion is also an image of our ways of thinking  and our interpretive practices giving material shape to the social bond.  Collective distinctions are an image of the “thing” it is assumed to dis- tinguish, that specific “shape,” or relationship assumed to “stand for” re- ligion, that specific “transfer of meaning.” At the same time, distinction  expresses ways of distinguishing, and so, is an image of collective ways  and hence too, of the social bond (the “transfer of meaning” licensing it  </page> <page sequence="16"> 582 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 to “stand for” the social bond). As such distinguishing (of religion, truth,  any concept or distinction), the totemic character of the image shows our  relatedness to one another, the effervescence of our being-with each and  all, because it makes reference to our social bond (the openness of the  whole) and to the multitude of ways in which our belonging to our com- monness as such is disseminated in the practices of our life. Since Durkheim argues that such distinctions refer to a species of  material things that make reference to the social bond itself through  the very act of designation, distinguishing (or what we might call con- ceptualization), is a way of doing self-reference. The things named by  the distinction and the distinction itself unfailingly show the relatives  in their active relatedness. Distinguishing is self-referential because the  regime of the distinguishers shows itself as “sovereign” in the action of  distinguishing: the object of any classification is the social bond itself in  a way that makes a concept not simply a symbol of the material thing it  designates (as in reference), but of an image of society with its distinct- ive social bond. The topic/topos of any distinction is the sovereignty of  the social bond itself as reflected in images (distinctions) that play out  some of the many ways in which sovereignty binds. We can begin to recover the problem of distinguishing (as the con- ceptualization that is both our inheritance and phenomenon) for, if we  are correct in assuming the necessity and desirability of distinctions, it is  the same as suggesting that our distinctions appear as collective methods  through which self-understanding of the social bond (society) is formed  in concepts. Our distinctions are ways of giving material, actualized  shape to thoughts about the social bond. Because of the opacity of the  social bond (that it is only “reflected” in the common name we bear), it  can appear vague, insubstantial, and ethereal, while yet experienced as  an “impersonal force.” If the experience of the social bond is touched by  this aura of ambiguity, it is as if absent while present to us as a trace of  energy. To paraphrase Durkheim, distinguishing  is the religion, not of such and such animals or men or images, but of an  anonymous and impersonal force, found in each of these beings but not  to be confounded in any of them. No one possesses it entirely and all  participate in it. It is so completely independent of the particular subjects  in whom it incarnates itself, that it precedes them and survives them. In- dividuals die, generations pass and are replaced by others; but this force  always remains actual, living and the same. It animates the generations  of today as it animates those of yesterday and as it will animate those of  to-morrow...it is only the material form under which the imagination rep- resents this immaterial substance, this energy diffused through all sorts of  heterogeneous things, which alone is the real object (EFRL: 217). </page> <page sequence="17"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             583 If the insubstantial and immaterial social bond is an energy diffused  throughout collective life, as if an impersonal force that touches us or  reaches us throughout our wide and varied practices of distinguishing,  then it seems both imperceptible and yet visible to a discerning eye (the  eye of Durkheim) as a special quality even as it materializes in objectifi- cations. What shows itself in any such object (i.e., its being apprehended  in perception by the synthesis of the general idea, the psyche and in- dividual body), no matter how profane, is its connotative richness, its  character as a symbol, and so its site as a reflection of the social bond.  Durkheim suggests that the very power of the social bond mater- ializes through this experience of its anonymity and impersonality in  ways that distinguish those with a common name as a mortal collective  in contrast to the eternity of the social. Paradoxically, the “anonymity  and impersonality” of the social (its propensity to dissolve borders and  boundaries), by inviting actions of separation and distinction, is a gift of  collectivization that inspires distinguishing in ways that are themselves  distinctive: “discourse is marked by the appearance of formulae, of secu- lar and sacred and political kinds, which condense social knowledge.  They are characterized by all the attributes of social facts but particularly  by objectivity and externality, and, [Durkheim] notes, by the fact that as  codes their existence is separate from their application” (Gane 1983: 9).  That is to say that society and its writing (its scripts, formulae, conven- tions, distinctions) give body to Other, bring to view the tension in trying  to determine what is essentially indeterminate, making of each and any  study a work site for exposing such a collision, a site that particularizes  ambiguity through examples that identify ways of managing and dispos- ing of specific content. If, at critical moments or in crises, the social bond appears to and for  the many as a practical concern and matter for intense contemplation,  then it is on occasion and sporadically that the mortality of collective  life comes alive to the discerning eye of theorizing in the smallest details  and in profane practices. Durkheim’s conception of the effervescence of  social life and of its contagiousness suggests that this energy accentuates  the experience of the mortality of collective life in ways that are enervat- ing rather than deadly. If this is so, then totemism, and the name we share  with others, might be something other than an oppressive inheritance,  something celebratory. Thus, Durkheim’s conception of totemism is a figure of speech for  the unstated influence of the social upon all distinguishing. This shows  us, sociologically, how philosophy must be part of the multitude. Yet, at  the same time, it raises the question of how the multitude can be philo- </page> <page sequence="18"> 584 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 sophical if we are condemned to reiterate our totemic heritage in the  most subversive gestures, since we can only transgress whatever we “see  in advance” to require such opposition. The question continues to per- sist: how is theorizing possible if it is socially determined?  Totemism is the conception Lacan uses to ground his maxim that  the “unconscious is structured like a language” (1998 [1975]: 20). As  he puts it,  Before any experience, before any individual deduction, even before those  collective experiences that may be related to social needs are inscribed in  it, something organizes this field, inscribes its initial lines of force. This  is the function that Levi-Strauss shows us to be the truth of the totemic  function, and which reduces its experience—the primary classificatory  function (Lacan 1998 [1975]: 20).  But it is Durkheim and not Levi Strauss who enunciates this initial  determination of the subject, in medias res, inheriting “whatever nature  may offer as supports” (20), the structure of signification within which  the subject “situates himself...counting” in a way that eventually in- cludes “in this counting he who counts” (20). This is what Georg Simmel  intends when he says that we (the subject) not only have boundaries but  are boundaries (Simmel 1971: 353), that is, we not only distinguish, but  are distinguished in and by our manner of distinguishing. Durkheim’s  conception of the totemic web means that we always begin tasks like  identifying and differentiating, as subject to the “something” that organ- izes our counting, our experience, the “whatever” that “nature may offer  as supports.” This “classificatory function” is then accidental (“what- ever”), an interdiction (“lines of force”), and fragmentary (an expression  of the “classificatory function” that remains to be developed). Yet, for Durkheim, the totemic function is more, for if the “meaning- ful” connection between the linen and the flag is accidental and does  not have to be in the way it is, then its being done or made in this way  becomes normative for us: “we could not do the thing we call describing  (e.g. flag) if language did not provide (we had not been taught) words  normative for describing” (Cavell 1969: 22). The accident (this connec- tion) and the interdiction (its normativity) come together. Moreover, they  are a case of borrowed desire, and so, they are mimetic since our act of  identifying a “flag” is grounded in nothing other than this “fact” that this  is the way the other (everyone, anyone, the all) does it. The symbolic  order seems to limit us to treat the action of relating to the flag, of distin- guishing it in this sense, in terms of how it is done (by the others). This  vision of the symbolic order seems to limit desire to the relation to the  rule or the normative. </page> <page sequence="19"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             585 According to Durkheim, we are relatives because we relate by virtue  of the name (EFRL: 122). The name is an accident that makes us rela- tives, instanciating us as a “we” who are in contact, who are “mutually  oriented” and so, the accident (of the name, the thing whose name we  bear) creates us as a bond, bonded to one another. Note two qualifica- tions that Simmel has persistently emphasized in his work: each and all  of us conceive of ourselves separately as more than this bond because  this bond links us in the most general ways (as bearers of the name); that  is, we think of ourselves as “individual,” as having a little something  special and extra that sets us apart. And the bond is more than any one  of us in the sense that we think of the other from the place where we are  not, and we think that the other thinks of us from the place where it is  not. Any one of us is more than the collective and the collective is more  than any one of us. Yet this commonplace topic of religion can only  intimate its function as the totemic collectivization of a deeper concern  for Durkheim, namely, the secret story of the need to defer the question  of ambiguity in relation to the bond of individual to society, of identity  to difference, that in being taken up by theorizing, can only situate the  theorist as together and apart in relation to this order. the death drive in The Division of Labor and suiciDe  Durkheim’s ambivalence towards death is reflected in different places  and with often disparate implications. At the end of The Division of  Labor he remarks on how the fact that most people live displays a pref- erence for life as if the choice, if it is a choice, is similar to an election  result: “The only experimental fact proving that life is generally good is  that the great mass of men prefer it to death” (Durkheim 1933 [1893]:  245). As he elaborates, To be so, in the average life, happiness must prevail over unhappiness.  If the relations were reversed, neither the attachment of men to life, nor  its continuance jostled by the facts at each moment could be understood.  Pessimists...explain the persistence of this phenomenon by the illusions  of hope. According to them, if...we hold onto life, it is because we are  wrongly hoping that the future will make up for the past. But...hope... does not explain itself. It has not miraculously descended from heaven  into our hearts, but it has had to be formed, as all sentiments, within the  action of the facts. If...men have learned to hope...they have acquired the  habit of turning their eyes toward the future, and of awaiting compensa- tions for their present sufferings (Durkheim 1933 [1893]: 245). </page> <page sequence="20"> 586 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 Certainly, then, suicide would reflect the opinions of the losing party  or at least those who were out-voted (raising the interesting question of  whether those who are out-voted in life in any and all areas can rightfully  be called “the losers”). Most people choose to live, Durkheim says. But  then again is life really a choice at all? If we think this way, then when  people decide not to live, it is the exception to the rule that reminds us  of the rule. Simmel affirms that we never think of the normative except  in the presence of infraction, shown for example in the greeting, which  goes undetected as a social form until it is noticed as missing (1956,  400). Durkheim’s opinion that living affirms wanting to live is analogous  to his hard-hearted conception of the statistic and the rate (see Durkheim  1951 [1897]: 41-43, 57-103 for the logic of the rates) — a brute, inani- mate and undeveloped sign — as pregnant with an implicit connotative  surfeit that can only invite us to fill it in in ways that make it meaningful.  Here, Durkheim assumes not only that living is not wanting to die in  a way that makes living a choice, but he assumes living to be a course  of action itself meaningful rather than as merely existing or enduring  whatever conditions we happen to inherit as in survival or bare life. In  other words, Durkheim runs roughshod over all vital distinctions and the  categories we live by in our language, seeming to suggest that he is indif- ferent to whether language lives or dies (as if his decision to do empirical  sociology might be suicidal for any reflective interest).  But in Suicide, Durkheim seems to hold that it is death rather than  life that is natural, that life should not be taken for granted because the  natural propensity for death rather than life is only counteracted by the  mediation of the social, that in counteracting death, the social connects  humans to life, and by failing this, leaves them to their own resources.  Suicide then is a book on such abandonment, the conditions under which  the tie to life is weakened rather than strengthened (see Durkheim 1951  [1897]: 156-276 on the typology of egoistic, altruistic, and anomic rela- tions to suicide).  For Durkheim, desire becomes transparent as an impasse in his con- ception of anomie and its effects, revealing endless and ongoing striving  as a malady of modern life because of the fundamental irresolution of any  attempt at satisfaction. Derrida’s (1981 [1972]: 61-172) reformulation of  the pharmakon is an apt figure for depicting how any achievement sim- ply releases further problems in ways that make desire insatiable. The  production and reproduction of life as the production of the desire for  more than life, must inevitably result in ends that can only stimulate new  beginnings, as any problem solved makes the solution a new problem to  master in this unending cycle of desiring action. Thus, the addiction to  </page> <page sequence="21"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             587 life, almost corporeal or compulsive in The Division of Labor, becomes  more than this as desire itself, the desire for desire, to become its own ob- ject and of course, both a necessary and impossible attainment (Simmel  1971; Pippin 2011). Durkheim then poses as his fundamental problem to  be addressed in The Elementary Forms, the question of how this desire  for life can continue in the face of mortality, asking the question of the  meaning of life, or what makes life worth living. In the human way soci- ology must treat death indirectly, first by keeping in mind the difference  between existence and life (between “merely” existing and living with  a degree of zest), between hunger and love (as in Lacan), it could treat  existence as a kind of living death that “life” strives to avoid. We could  say that in this way sociology questions the self-evidence of life itself by  finding it queer or odd in Wittgenstein’s (1958 [1953]) sense, odd that  humans would keep on with life in the face of such inevitability. More important, Durkheim suggests that this “keeping at life” is un- canny because it is not perfunctory nor a matter of adapting with resigna- tion to bad conditions. Rather it is devoted and enthusiastic to the point  where it exceeds the expectations of these observers, that life and living  is embraced in ways that can have important worldly results. Life then,  takes on a charged meaning when it seems to be lived at the edge of the  border between living and dying, reminding us of Bataille’s formula for  the general economy involving action guided by the expectation of loss  as great as possible (e.g., war, gambling; 1985: 116-130). Living at the  edge (with an awareness of death in this sense) becomes the passion that  enters into the over-stimulated ambitious strivings both of anomie and of  the energetic enterprising activities of commerce. Whereas Durkheim more or less disregards the dynamics of this ex- cess, anomie arising out of the desire to heal or reconcile the tension  between the social and the personal, it seems that the instability of desire  is a function of the continuous frustration aroused by unrealized satisfac- tions. That is, life must stimulate desire that it cannot fulfill and can only  end up being displaced in the frustrations and aggressivity (in Lacan- ian terms), created by the desire of and for life, producing the constant  alienation of the subject fated always to fall short of his or her own ex- pectations. Durkheim’s interlocutor could only be embodied in the stoic  advice to limit one’s expectations as a way of erasing the possibility of  disappointment.  </page> <page sequence="22"> 588 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 the SeCret Story  Derrida’s reading of the Czech philosopher Jan Patocka elucidates Pa- tocka’s notion of how religion in some way engages the demonic, where  the secret refers to the trauma released by the fact of death and its mys- tery. Patocka criticizes the use of religion to act out or engage the un- known in irresponsible ways in contrast to the notion of self-monitoring  that he thinks that religion in the best sense makes possible. Derrida says: There is first of all demonic mystery in itself, one might say. Then there  is the structure of secrecy that keeps that mystery hidden, incorporated,  concealed but alive, in the structure of free responsibility that claims to  go beyond it and that in fact only succeeds by subordinating mystery and  keeping it subjugated... In short, waking from demonic mystery, surpass- ing the demonic, involves attaining the possibility of the secretum, of the  keeping of a secret. For it also involves gaining access to the individual- ization of the relation to oneself (1995: 20) As noted above, Durkheim identifies the mystery first in The Divi- sion of Labor, in ways that make transparent the impossible and neces- sary desire for life, the mystery of this problematic desire for life. It  amounts to disclosing life itself to be the mystery, and its demonic char- acter shown to reside in the havoc this can create if the secret is not kept,  keeping hidden but alive this secret while claiming to move beyond it.  Durkheim shows how anomie works in its way to conceal the secret and  yet, to preserve it in some sense, as the action of being responsible to  any present and its demands (see my discussion of death in Blum 2011a:  250-251; 2011b; 2013a forthcoming).  ConCluSion: the SoCial automaton; the automation of life If religion as a conceptual site is the material beginning of The Elemen- tary Forms, then this totemic attachment to its concept (i.e. the concept  of “religion”) must be capable of initiating a movement towards theor- izing the relationship that it masks. That is, the concept of religion re- mains a posit that begins inquiry by its provocative status as an opening  that invites working-through. If all are bound together by virtue of be- ing touched by the intelligibility of religion as a commonplace concept,  then all must be in position to desire more, to begin to work though the  analytic character of this relationship in Freud’s sense of durcharbeiten  or “working-through” (1924 [1914]). Working-through is the passage  in an analysis where the inquirer reflectively engages a concept used  </page> <page sequence="23"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             589 at the beginning, as an occasion for retrieving its grounds in unspoken  and forceful conceptions of a problematic situation. It is derived from  the Freudian conception of returning to the subject his/her message in  another form. In the case of religion, this working-through concerns re- turning to the member who orients to religion as a concept, a translated  version (making reference to its assumptions and grounds) in another  way. Durkheim shows that the secular cannot stand to the sacred as an  advance, (i.e., as a paradigm for the progress of modernization), because  the attachment to a sense of the sacred is integral to any secular society,  its elementary foundation. Here is what I have been proposing. In The Division of Labor in Society, Durkheim discovers that every- one chooses to live regardless of their happiness or unhappiness in ways  that suggest to him the corporeality of drive, the drive of life; this reson- ates with Lacan’s distinction between desire and drive. At this point, the  tie to life seems connected to the pleasure of work, the solidarity of its  occupational communities and the like, as if the commitment to life (that  seems irrational but driven) can only be accounted for in this way. Here,  there is an element of compulsion in the drive to live, as if anything else  is unintelligible. Suicide dramatizes this impasse not simply through the  inevitable failure of desire to realize itself in anything other than its own  infinite and unending perplexity (Benardete 1991; Žižek et al. 2011),  but in the failure of systems of social support to provide any essential  relief to anomic, disoriented self-representation. The Elementary Forms  then depicts how religion constitutes a response to the problem of the  value of life and the question of the grounds for living. The book seeks  to pose a dialogic response to the question of how the value of life can  be produced and reproduced as something other than the endurance and  survival of bare life, or by doctrinal salvation but as a commitment to the  value of life, as part of automated habitation to the social order that is  inherited, rather than as doing time. Durkheim shows in The Division of Labor that we live in spite of  unhappiness and not because of happiness, almost as if compelled by  a drive for life. Durkheim shows in Suicide that just as we cannot find  fulfillment in happiness and material progress, our ambition and desire is  continuously unsatisfied, only leading to unending repetitious and over- stimulated striving that fails to hit its mark. Yet, if we continue to live,  it is not clear that such continuation is a choice, a free choice. Could it  be religion that keeps us alive? The Elementary Forms teaches that it is  not religious doctrine at all that fortifies us but simply the compulsive  drive to be and remain in society; in this sense, we are driven by our  objectification in and of society, as those who must embrace their ob- </page> <page sequence="24"> 590 © Canadian Journal of SoCiology/CahierS CanadienS de SoCiologie 39(4) 2014 jecthood, their commitment to being nothing more than automated, to  being something that is nothing and yet capable of laughing, of being the  object whose freedom to laugh and cry is constrained by the inability to  do anything more. This is akin to what Mario Perniola (2004) calls the  sex appeal of the inorganic that makes addiction the paradigm of modern  philosophies of desire. In this view, the automaton is then one who is  addicted to the social as anyone must be, and who has the capacity upon  reflection for reflection and for the irony that this can make possible  (unlike, say, the robot, who is condemned to mindless addiction). In this  respect, Cioran is quite pertinent: A conformist, I live, I try to live, by imitation, by respect for the rules of  the game, by horror of originality. An automaton’s resignation: to affect a  pretense of fervor and secretly to laugh at it; to bow to conventions only to  repudiate them on the sly... The man who scorns everything must assume  an air of perfect dignity, deceive the others and even himself; thereby he  will more easily accomplish his task of counterfeit living (Cioran 1998  [1949]: 104). If modern views typically hold that the caginess of the calculating game  player personifies the up-to-date sensibility and the capacity to exercise  free choice within such limits of the game and its normativity, then Durk- heim’s sociology suggests that the model of addiction and its automation  is more apt.  Automation is similar to being possessed as in addiction, with the  subject driven in the grip of an imaginary hold of the “object” society  without respect to content. If the social constructionist model excludes  being possessed, leaves out the drive for jouissance under the spell of  the imaginary, we must still concede that theorizing, too, has to be pos- sessed and not simply strategic; theorizing has to be driven by the de- sire for truth or whatever, even for self-knowledge in the highest form  of Socratic mania, in the grip of possessiveness. This gives flesh to the  Lacanian conception of the elementary structure as delusional, not as a  critique or lament, but as the disclosure of our limits (Blum 2013b). Yet,  well before Lacan, we hear this comment of Durkheim: (I)f we give the name delirious to every state in which the mind adds to  the immediate data given by the senses and projects its own sentiments  and feelings into things, then nearly every collective representation is in  a sense delirious; religious beliefs are only one particular case of a very  general law. Our whole social environment seems to us to be filled with  forces which really exist only in our own minds (EFRL: 259). </page> <page sequence="25"> durkheim’S ruSe: the ConCept aS SeduCtion             591 Here is the final word on Durkheim’s ruse: if it seems as if we are study- ing religion, then this seduction points us towards a “proper” reflect- ive relationship to the imaginative foundation of the social order and its  elementary delirium. That the delusional foundation of life should not  be cause for lament gives ground to our need to resist agitation and to  cultivate a degree of impersonality that might, at its best, nurture subver- sive gestures in many shapes in the space (and hope) for improvisational  action. Durkheim’s symbolic order pictures the ceremonial underside of  the persistent and perennial struggle in life for wiggle room and recom- mends studying this environment and, at our best, if we have the gift,  helping our fellow beings manage its fluctuations of fortune. referenCeS Auerbach, Eric. 1953 [1946].

His current teaching and research is  informed by his work developed over the years on theorizing and methods for  the analysis of social forms, most recently in studies on the city, materialism  and idealism in everyday life, on institutions such as law, medicine, and the uni- versity, on the emotions, and particularly disease and suffering, and on voice,  humor, aesthetics and ethics as resources for inquiry. Prof. Blum’s recent work  on birth, death and dying, the city, and mental disease and illness is informed by  this interpretive framework. E-mail: blum@yorku.ca </page> </plain_text>
