<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY, PAPUA By B. J. Egloff* /^ OODENOUGH BAY, a large indentation in the eastern tip of Papua, is crowded ^J on all sides by abruptly rising mountains and steep hills. The people along its coasts are Melanesian language speakers and possess a complex of distinctive cultural traits which are common to the Southern Massim group (Seligmann, 1910). Stone groups and rock carvings are found in four areas along its coasts : Boianai, Meitepana and Radava; Wedau and Wamira ; Garuwai ; and Taupota (Map 1). For con- venience, these locations on Goodenough Bay are given the prefix God, to separate them from sites surveyed in other areas of eastern Papua, and serially assigned numbers. Letters are then used to differentiate features within sites. 0 · ^ TROWUA» - 4 «-' OvMuU I I y/C^^'^X^WOOCt ** » iS&gt;iA»lD ' ' Amphtott Group (Γ «^5 " ' GOOOCNgJJGH ISLAND ,*% ^^Vs^-^ Or^X - *O Ν ) «Ä6USS0W ISIANO i Ç^"^ V^SNORMANBY IStANO Τ»Μροϊϊ*ν&lt;ΛΟ ^^"^ * · ■ Geruw«*^ V_-^^^ U»t C*p· &lt;-^*„ ' ^*&gt; TUBE TUBE I SLAMO r' Mt$tM.A Si^wO S0UthCePe .WARMSLANO % ^ o : '&gt; DOSSIL ISLANO EASTERN PAPUA ^Γ^ν ^^^ k i lorn·« r· % ^^J^ Map i. * Department of Prehistory, Australian National University.</page><page sequence="2">148 ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY I· / i ζ- - φ l ψ ^ Η.

The rock carvings and stone groups within these villages have been known in part for a number of years and have features in common with other stone groups in the Massim. The arrange- ments and isolated boulders can be divided into four formal categories : arrangements, pavements, rock carvings, and stones associated with mythical beings. These often occur in combined forms. Figure 1. - Stone arrangements of Boianai, Meitepana and Radava (God 1). Three stone arrangements are found in Radava and Meitepana (Map 2). The most important of these is the legendary home of Wakeke in Radava (Figure 1 (a)). South of this monument is a pavement constructed of small stones (Figure 1 (b)) A roughly carved bowl, with a maximum diameter of 24 cm., sits in the centre of the ε</page><page sequence="4">150 ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY pavement (Plate I (A)). Wakeke, in the form of a snake, is said to have lived in this bowl, which once had a lid until it was stolen by mountain people (Ananias, 1959). In Meitepana, a second stone bowl is found in a circular arrangement with an attached pavement (Figure 1 (c)). Teruea, an old magician who practised on pigs and gardens, is said to be buried under this feature. To the north is a group of five stones which is said to be the talking place of the early missionaries (Figure 1 (d)). This arrangement has an ovoid basalt boulder backed by a calcareous slab as a dominant element. Three light grey porphyritic shafts of equal height are placed to the sides and front. Ten stones bearing petrographs were investigated at Boianai ; however, for reasons explained later other rock carvings were probably hidden by the villagers. God la. Two carved stones called riti are part of Wakeke' s Rouse and are said to be the foundation stones of the village. They are decorated with simple scroll and concentric circle motifs (Williams, 1931, PL X, Figs. 1 and 4). God le. This pyramidal shaped boulder has two of its faces covered with large concentric circles surmounted by a series of concentric arcs (Plate I (B)). God If. Concentric circles, both separate and conjoined, cover the north- eastern face of this large boulder. Figure 2 (if) illustrates a particularly clear and well-executed portion of the design. God Ig. This stela is decorated with a symmetrically rendered stylized face formed by three interlocking scrolls (Figure 2 (ig)). God lh. Elaborately carved interlocking scrolls and circles are found on the smoothest face of this large boulder. Figure 2 (ih) is a rubbing of a section of the carving which illustrates the complexity of design common to scroll work in the Massim. God li. This large dark basalt boulder has its eastern face covered with deeply carved concentric circles. God lj and Ik. These stones lie side by side in the bridge embankment, having been placed there in recent years, lj is decorated with a scroll and Ik bears a complex pair of interlocking scrolls (Figure 2 (17) and (ik)). God 11. This shaft is 45 cm. high and ovoid in cross-section. Except for a portion at the base, it is covered with concentric circles, interlocking scrolls and a series of nested hooks. A significant feature is the stylized face motif on the obverse side. The. croix à enveloppe on the reverse is of further interest (Figure 2 (1/)). Two öi||he carved rocks in Meitepana (le and if), as well as three uncarved boulders, arläelements of the cassowary myth. This myth tells of a woman's anger with a husband who did not bring home any food from the garden. She changed into a cassowary bird and ran into the bush. The stones that her husband threw at her as she ran away are the cassowary stones (Ker, 1910, 90-92). Williams (1931, PL X, Fig. 2) illustrates four carved stones from Boianai, one of which has a complex design composed of concentric circles with hooks enclosed</page><page sequence="5">THE ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY, PAPUA.

The remaining three stones have concentric circles, scrolls and meandering lines carved on their surface. These same stones are illustrated by Vogan (1937, Fig. 6), who states that they came from Dogura, the mission station at Wedau. Figure 3. - Stone arrangements of Wedau and Wamira (God 2). The carved curvilinear motifs are referred to as giripipina. This word in Boniki (the language of Boianai) is also used to refer to female facial tattoos which are often composed of intricate scrolls with attached hooks as well as the croix à enveloppe (Williams, 1931, 138-40). The stone bowls of groups b and c have parallels in the Massim, where there are reports of a ceramic bowl associated with the stone group at Taupota, and a hollowed-out stone bowl found in the stone group at Tagorewara, on the north side of Milne Bay (Murray, 1933, 18 ; Seligmann, 1910, 465). Williams</page><page sequence="8">ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY 153 found a hollowed-out stone at Lohomunidabu associated with rock carvings (Williams, 1931, 129). These bowls are generally said to have been used to mix pigments for body paint or as mirrors when filled with water. Wakeke's stone bowl could well have served as a mortar at one time, though there is no direct evidence for this. God 2 - Wedau and W amira In Wedau there is a stone circle which is said to be a clan burial place where known ancestors are buried (Figure 3 (a)). Immediately south of Wedau, in Wamira village, three ovoid pavements of dark grey to black basalt stones with upright slabs and shafts in their periphery are found (Figure 3 (c)t (d) and (e) ; Plate I (C)). Williams (1931, Fig. 5) illustrates both faces of the single carved stone in Wedau. Figure 2 (2b) gives a complete rendering of the design on one side of the stone. The other side is so badly worn that it is almost impossible to improve upon Williams' version. The lower portion of the motif is executed with V-shaped incisions rather than the U-shaped groove of the Boianai carvings. The concentric arcs and circles at the top are made with U-shaped grooves. The U-shaped grooves result from a pecking technique, while the V-shaped grooves are primarily incised. God 3 - Garuwai Approximately 1 km. inland from Garuwai are four stone circles. The circular groupings are constructed of boulders, perhaps 40 cm. in diameter and numbering from six to eight, arranged in a circle. The arrangements are from 4 m. to 5 m. in diameter and are dominated in every instance by a single large upright standing stone. Two of the circles are paved with small river pebbles. These circles are named Yogayoga, Modewa, Tem and Mongo. None of the stones are carved. The local villagers say that at one time their villages were near these circles, where the ancestors used to have council meetings. A few potsherds were found at Yogayoga and Morigo, but there appeared to be no depth to the deposit nor any noticeable concentrations. The identifiable sherds are similar to modern Wari Island ceramics. God 4-Taupota Circumstances made it impossible for me to visit the stone arrangement at Taupota. To the best of my knowledge this is the only stone group that I did not visit in a two months' survey of Goodenough Bay which extended from Boga Boga to Garuwai. Seligmann (1910, PI. LVII) presents a restoration of the feature. The circular arrangement of upright slabs in a ring of small rubble boulders differs in degree from the other stone groups of Goodenough Bay, but is of the same kind. Discussion The people of Goodenough Bay view these stones with varying attitudes. Unlike the stones at Wedau-Wamira and Garuwai, the Boianai people regard their monuments highly. At one time the arrangement at Wedau was regarded with more esteem than it is now (Seligmann, 1910, 329). In Boianai, the riti stones are regarded as the foundation stones of the village and no one during more traditional times lifted</page><page sequence="9">154 ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY his voice near the stones of Wakeke's House. The Boianai people say, " that while the stones stand firm the village will be secure, the gardens alright and the people strong in every way ". Forty-two years after Williams' (1931) excavation in Wakeke's House, where he found potsherds and human bones, the villagers regret his actions deeply. After obtaining permission from the village council, I commenced recording the carvings and locations of the stone arrangements. I then noticed the villagers covering various stones with pots and copra sacks to conceal them from my investigations. Hogbin (1935, 329) illustrates a stone shaft and pavement in the Schouten Islands off the north coast of New Guinea. To the Wogeo people this shaft represents a spirit which superficially is identical to the Boianai people's belief about the riti stone. To some extent Wakeke is believed to be residing in his house today. The concentric circles and scroll motifs of Goodenough Bay rock art have elements in common with petrographs found at Bisiai and Sisiana on Normanby Island (F. E. Williams, 1931, 131-33, Fig. 4 and PI. XVI ; H. T. Williams, 1954, Pis. Ζ and AA). The anthropomorphic figures found with the curvilinear motifs at Bisiai, a site north of Sewa Bay, have no parallels at Boianai but are somewhat similar to figures at Lohumunidabu in the Central District (Williams, 1931, PL XV). Rock paintings are found on Goodenough Island (Jenness and Ballantyne, 1920, facing 198) as well as outside the Massim in the Sogeri area near Port Moresby (Leask, 1943 ; White and White, 1964 ; Williams, 1931) and in the Buang area south-west of Lae (Girard, 1957). The Buang paintings are sophisticated representations of anthropomorphic figures which have no parallels in the Massim. The simple zoomorphic representations found with the anthropomorphic figures at Buang are like those found on Goodenough Island and the Sogeri sites, particularly the lizard motif. The ubiquitous croix à enveloppe is reported by the Whites (1964, Fig. 12) at Batari in the Eastern Highlands and near the Strickland River in the Western Highlands (White, 1969, Fig. 2). The Boianai rock art is amazingly similar to a number of examples which lie far afield. Rocks decorated with curvilinear motifs from the Sepik River area show remarkable resemblances to the Boianai carvings (Wirz, 1959, Pis. 33, 34). The rock art of Goodenough Bay has obvious parallels in New Caledonia (Chevalier, 1958-59, 1963-65 ; Luquet, 1926 ; Oriol, 1948), where the scroll, concentric circles, circle with rays or spokes, croix à enveloppe and face designs are recorded. Similar features are seen in New Hanover rock art (Bühler, 1946-49, Pis. 11, 12 ; Lampert, 1968). Van der Sande (1907, 45) records the spiral with hooks used as a scarification element on Humbolt Bay. This was said to represent a mollusc in its spiral shell. Golson (in press) discusses the incised stone at Wedau in the light of its having essential elements in common with the Dong-son ship-of-the-dead complex. Stone arrangements and pavements are regularly encountered in the Massim Islands and extend to its easternmost extremity of Rössel Island (Armstrong, 1928), but appear to be restricted on the Papuan coast to Goodenough Bay, Milne Bay and South Cape (Lindt, 1887, 78 ; Riesenfeld, 1950, Map IV ; Seligmann, 1910, 463-65).</page><page sequence="10">ROCK CARVINGS AND STONE GROUPS OF GOODENOUGH BAY 155 The stone arrangements of the Trobriand Islands (Austen, 1939) and to a lesser degree Woodlark Island (Forth, 1965) are carefully prepared arrangements of large calcareous sandstone slabs (Oilier and Holdsworth, 1968). These large structures represent the culmination, in terms of size and labour expended in construction, of the stone arrangement complex in the Massim. The similarities between the Goodenough Bay and New Caledonian petrographs and the absence of parallels in the immediately adjacent areas of Mainland Papua are striking. To consider the petrographs and stone arrangements as having a one-to-one cultural relationship is unfounded, but it is interesting to note that the stone arrange- ments of the Massim also have their closest parallels in island Melanesia (Riesenfeld, 1950, Maps I, II and IV).
