<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SF LITERATURE 271 Irena lantovska-Murray and Darko Suvin A Bibliography of General Bibliographies of SF Literature The following is a bibliography of general bibliographies of SF literature only, and does not include: bibliographies of individual authors; filmographies and bibliographies of comics; publisher checklists; library collections' catalogs and directories; SF cartographies or atlases. It aims to include bibliographies, indexes, and checklists of primary and secondary material concerning SF literature in books, periodicals, and dissertations up to and including 1975 (a few items from 1976 and 1977 have also been included). In a field abounding in unprinted fan items, only those which are still of interest and avail- able in one of the seven major libraries used (see below) have been retained. Otherwise we have aimed at the widest selection possible, though not for a quixotic total inclusive- ness (albeit of printed items only). We hope that this bibliography will be useful as an update of similar works, such as Briney and Wood or Osipov in our Section 1; that it will help to unify the efforts of English-language and European bibliographies by identify- ing for the English reader European sources of SF information, only infrequently known to him; and finally, that it will serve as a useful starting point to students and researchers, throwing a small light on "the multitude of books that is making us ignorant," as Vol- taire said. For more help in this endeavor, the fundamental items in sections 1 and 4 are preceded by an asterisk (*). The libraries and collections used to examine items in this bibliography were: The Library of Congress, Washington, DC; the MIT Science Fiction Society Library, Cam- bridge, MA; the SF holdings of the Special Collections Department, Temple University libraries, Philadelphia; the Spaced Out Library of the Toronto Public Libraries System; the John Robarts Library, University of Toronto; and the McLennan Library, McGill University, Montreal. Acknowledgements are due to the staff of all these institutions, with special affectionate thanks to the indispensable Interlibrary Loans Service of McLennan Library. We also gratefully acknowledge the financial support of a two- year Quebec Ministry of Education FCAC grant without which this project would not have been possible. 1. General Works and Bibliographies of Bibliographies. *Angenot, Marc. "A Select Bibliography of the Sociology of Literature." Science- Fiction Studies, 4 (1977), 295-308. Extensive survey of this important field done in view of SF criticism, but not listing works exclusively on SF. Ca. 200 entries are divided into: 1) Bibliographies; 2) Journals; 3) Literature and Society: Basic Works; 4) Ideology and literature (includes works on utopia as ideology); 5) Sociology of Literary Institu- tions and of Mass Culture; 6) Paraliterature. Especially valuable for its equal considera- tion of works in main European languages (mainly in English, French, and German, but also Italian, Spanish, and Russian) and for its clear and severe annotations. *Barron, Neil, ed. Anatomy of Wonder: Science Fiction. New York and London: Bowker, 1976. 471p. Supersedes the editor's bibliographic essays in Choice (Jan. 1970 and Sept. 1973). A critical guide to teaching, research, collection building, and reading. Priority is given to 20th-Century US book sources, although major foreign works avail- able in translation and essential magazines are mentioned. Citations offer full biblio- graphic information, inclusive of price, with preference for US imprints. Suggested core-collection titles are indicated. Annotations include outline of contents and plot summaries for fictional material. Part I covers the history of SF: SF up to 1870 (com- piler R.M. Philmus) is represented by 50 titles; 1870-1926 (T.D. Clareson) by 177; 1926- 37 (I. Rogers) by 73; 1938-75 (J. De Bolt and J.R. Pfeiffer) by 650 author titles plus 50 anthologies; juvenile SF (F.J. Molson) by 100 titles. Part n introduces and lists major critical, historical, and bibliographical reference tools, periodicals, and awards. H.W.</page><page sequence="2">272 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 5 (1978) Hall's section on major library collections of SF and fantasy in the US and Canada and a directory of publishers conclude the volume. Author and title indexes give additional access to material. This comprehensive reference tool is an indispensable complement to earlier SF bibliographies. *Briney, Robert E., and Edward Wood. SF Bibliographies: An Annotated Bib- liography of Bibliographical Works on Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction. Chicago: Advent, 1972. 49p. In four sections: magazine indexes; bibliographies of individual authors; general SF bibliographies and checklists; and foreign language bibliographies. Inclusions and bibliographies in periodicals are omitted. The entries are arranged by title, except for the section of individual authors where personal names serve as the main entry. Information includes author/compiler, publisher and place of publication, date, pagination, size, and method of production and binding; prices are included when available. Annotations are largely descriptive. Although far from complete in the individual authors section and lacking a systematic coverage in the foreign bib- liographies portion, this is a major effort to bring together a number of important SF bibliographies. Many items listed are either out-of-print or poorly accessible fan compilations. Lerner, Fred. An Annotated Checklist of Science Fiction Bibliographical Works. East Paterson, NJ: Compiler, 1969. 6 1. List of 19 titles, considered essential for col- lection-building. Superseded by Briney and Wood, and Barron, ed. *McGhan, Barry. Science Fiction and Fantasy Pseudonyms. Dearborn, MI: Misfit Press, 1976. 70p. Supersedes the 1971 edn. and the 1973 supplement. Collection of entries gleaned largely from Bleiler, Metcalf, and Tuck (q.v. all), covering 945 authors and close to 1,500 corresponding pen-names. Omissions and inaccuracies are partly due to sources. Listing is alphabetical in one sequence. Each entry is coded in reference to source. *Osipov, A[leksandr N.]. "Nauchnaia fantastika," Bibliotekar', No. 8 (1971), 45-50. Excellent overview of principal sources for SF theory, history, and criticism in USSR. Emphasizes the main exponents of post-1917 criticism. Special attention is given to publisher's series of SF and to bibliographies and bio-bibliographical sources of authors, including major foreign influences (Wells, lrapek). Pfeiffer, John R. Fantasy and Science Fiction: A Critical Guide. Palmer Lake, CO: Filter Press, 1971. 64p. Approximately half of the book is devoted to 20th-Century SF authors. Arranged alphabetically under the author's real name are representative titles, inclusive only of the first date of publication and the number of known editions or privileges. Most titles are further coded to denote the topic treated in each work; with ca. 40 codes available, this often results in a chain of a dozen letter symbols, totally confusing to the user. Subsequent, hardly representative, sections are assigned to: authors and works before 1900; periodicals; special anthologies, bibliographical works; "History and Criticism;" and fanzines. Title index follows. The overall selection seems haphazard and further damaged by poor organization. Superseded by Barron, ed. (q.v.). Sween, Roger D. Bibliography of Science Fiction. Milwaukee, WI: Wisconsin Council of Teachers of English, 1974. 28p. Introductory annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources covers close to 300 novels, short stories, and an- thologies, and supplies additional information on criticism, fan magazines, SF pub- lishers, and films. Omissions of important SF authors and brevity of scope are a major drawback. Superseded by Barron, ed., (q.v.) and SF filmographies. *Tuck, Donald H. The Encyclopedia of SF and Fantasy: A Bibliographic Survey of the Fields of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Through 1968. Vols. 1-2. Chicago, IL: Advent, 1974, 1978. 286p., 244 p. First 2 vols. of a 3-vol. work planned as a general reference tool; a completely revised and updated version of Tuck's Handbook of Science Fiction and Fantasy (1954; 2nd., enlarged edn. 1959). Emphasis is on the post-1945 period, partly in recognition of Bleiler (q.v.) whose checklist remains one of the chief sources used. Arrangement is alphabetical, by author: a brief bio- graphical note is provided, in each case followed by a wealth of bibliographical informa-</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SF LITERATURE 273 tion. Novels are covered comprehensively in the post-war period, with corrections and omissions for Bleiler included; ca. 1,550 collections and close to a thousand anthologies are listed under the author entries, inclusive of hard to find analytics. Entries for both fiction and non-fiction are frequently accompanied by brief annotations. Foreign translations relevant to author entries are listed with full publishing information. Paper- back editions, magazines, pseudonyms, etc., are here omitted as they will form a separate section in vol. 3. Although there are omissions, especially in the case of non- Anglophone writers, if and when completed this tool will be of primary importance to researchers in the field, above all for its attention to some difficult and confusing aspects of SF bibliography. *Versins, Pierre. Encyclopedie de l'utopie, des voyages extraordinaires et de la science fiction. Lausanne: L'Age d'Homme, 1972, 997p. Versin's ambitious attempt to write a comprehensive reference tool to SF, utopias, and extraordinary voyages is erudite, often exasperating, and particularly successful for modern European sources. Ca. 1,500 alphabetic entries include extensive author listings-often informal sketches-and a wide range of genre, thematic, and topical entries-at times substan- tial essays-e.g. on music, medicine, or even philately in SF. Almost 1,000 illustrations are included. A work of such magnitude by a single author cannot avoid omissions and oversights, which sometimes amount to arbitrariness (especially for modern English- language SF). Frequent cross-references do not make up for the most glaring omission, strongly curtailing its usefulness: an index which would permit access to precious and often fascinating information in the more extensive entries. Nonetheless an invaluable research tool. 2. Works on SF Periodicals. See also Barron and Briney-Wood in Section 1. Anderson, Leif. Index till de tio f6rsta arga'ngarna av tidskriften Hdpna! (Arg 1-10). Lind: Centauria Press, 1965, Suppl. by ...(Arg. 11-13). Ibidem, 1964-66. N. pag. Con- tents of the SF journal Hapna!, devoted mostly to translations of Anglophone authors and a few Swedish writers. The main index analyzes the first ten volumes (1954-63) by issue, by author, and by title. Register of secondary literature lists book reviews, film reviews, and some science popularization. Supplements maintain the original format for vol. 11-13, after which Hdpna! ceased appearing. Cockroft, T.G.L. Index to Weird Fiction Magazines. New York: Arno Press, 1975. 101p. Rpt. of the 1962-64 New Zealand edn. Two mimeographed indexes, by title and by author, cover close to 300 issues of Weird Tales between 1923 and 1954, also Golden Fleece (1938-39), Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror (1930-33), Strange Stories (1939-41), Strange Tales (1931-33), Strange Tales (British) 1946, 61 issues of Thrill Book (1919), Oriental Stories (1930-32), and Magic Carpet Magazine (1933-34). Verse is excluded. The index sections are introduced by a checklist of magazines indexed indicating date of issue, volume number, cover artist, and miscellaneous bibliographical detail if applicable. Also included are brief notes on reprints and translations. Day, Bradford M. The Complete Checklist of SF Magazines. Denver, NY: Science- Fiction and Fantasy Publications, 1961. 63p. Tabular listing of magazines from the 1890s on, having for principal content "super-imaginative fiction." Some foreign titles are included. The basic format is alphabetical, by title of each periodical, followed by chronological tabulation of existing issues and brief marginal genre description for each story (reprint, weird-horror, etc.). Title changes, mergers, and publication irregularities are indicated. Day, Donald B. Index to the SF Magazines 1926-1950. Portland, OR: Perri Press, 1952. 184p. Close to 50 magazine titles are analyzed by author and by title of the fiction included; both sections give full bibliographic information. Contains also a checklist of the magazines indexed, with additional publishing information: chronological se- quence of issues, size, pagination, and cover artists, where identified. A first major step towards a systematic coverage of the SF magazines; Metcalf's Index (q.v.) is an inde- pendent sequel to it.</page><page sequence="4">274 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 5 (1978) Desmond, William. The Science Fiction Magazine Checklist 1961-72. Cambridge, MA: Archival Press, 1973. N. pag. Loose sequel to Bradford Day's Complete Checklist of SF Magazines (q.v.), identical in format except for separating the magazines into those publishing original works and those devoted to reprints. The first category is arranged alphabetically by title, whereas the second is arranged alphabetically by publisher and then alphabetically by title. The grid arrangement allows coordinating year and month of publication in each case. Durie, A.J.L. An Index to the British Editions of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction," With a Cross-reference to the Original American Edition. Wisbech, Cambs.: Fantast, 1966. 44p. Rpt. of 1965 edn. Covers two series of selected reprints: the first (October 1953 to September 1954) covers 12 issues; the second (December 1959 to June 1964) covers 55 issues. Both series, indexed with the help of the Strauss and Lewis indexes (q.v. both), are here organized into four sections: chronological, by issue; alphabetical, by author; fiction only, by title; and articles only, by title. All sections have corresponding references to the American edn. of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Errata and addenda are made necessary by the secondary source ap- approach. Engel, Theodore. "Index," in Hugo Gernsback, Evolution of Modern Science Fiction. Chicago: World Science Fiction Convention, 1952, pp. 3-12. Index of early SF stories in magazines edited by Gernsback 1911-1928: Modern Electrics, Electrical Experimenter continued by Science and Invention, Radio News, and Practical Electrics continued by The Experimenter. The arrangement is chronological within each title, subdivided by individual issue. This index is complemented by T.G.L. Cockroft's Index to Fiction in Radio News and Other Magazines (Lower Hutt, New Zealand, 1970), which pro- vides the author/title access to the same magazines. Hoffman, Stuart. An Index to "Unknown" and "Unknown Worlds" by Author and by Title. Black Earth, WI: Sirius Press, 1953. 34p. Each title in this alphabetically arranged index is accompanied by brief description of place and characters involved. The characters are also accessible through a separate alphabetical checklist. There is an unnumbered Addenda sheet, in which the volumes and issues are listed with corresponding dates. Index to British SF Magazines, 1934-53. Canberra: Australian Science Fiction Association, no comp. given, no date [1968?1-. Checklist of magazine contents cross- indexed by author; cover and illustrators identified.

Index to the Science Fiction Magazines, 1966-1970. Cambridge, MA: New England Science Fiction Association, 1971. 82p. Supersedes annual issues for 1966, 67, 68, 69-70. Intended as a companion volume to Strauss (q.v.), the format follows his arrangement: by magazine, by title, by author. A separate checklist of maga- zines correlates dates, issues and volumes of magazine titles, inclusive of information on number and size of pages, and cover artists for each issue. Produced as an offset from computer printout, the format allows for an incorporation of additional cate- gories, specifying reprints, co-authored works, etc. Continued by The N.E.S.F.A. Index to the Science Fiction Magazines and Original Anthologies 1971-72, 1973, 1974, 1975 (q.v.). Metcalf, Norman. The Index of Science Fiction Magazines 1951-1965. El Cerrito,</page><page sequence="5">GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SF LITERATURE 275 CA: J. Ben Stark, 1968. 249 (251)p. A series of listings of contents in SF and Fantasy magazines. Bibliographic access is provided through author index, title index, artist index, and editor index, all alphabetically arranged. Pseudonym clues and cross- references are provided where possible. Unusual feature is an indication of the length of material in kilowords. Included is also a checklist of all major SF magazines published at the period, by volume, issue, number, size, number of pages and cover artists if known. Unlike Strauss's Index covering the identical period (q.v.), Metcalf's wealth of information includes also visual, biographical, and review contents of the magazines analyzed. Errata and addenda section is included for the period 1926-1950, to be used in conjunction with B. Day's Index... 1926-1950 (q.v.). The N.E.S.F.A.

The format is similar, although the con- cept is expanded to include "original series" anthologies, claimed to be "essentially magazines in different physical format." Comprehensive listing of new materials is accompanied by selected reprints. The annual or bi-annual volumes cover both British and U.S. magazines, adhering to the same triple-listing format as the Lewis/N.E.S.F.A. indexes, but supplemented by a checklist of items included. For anthologies, the check- list gives additional information regarding publisher, series, format, and editor. Strauss, Erwin S. The MIT Science Fiction Society's Index to the S-F Magazines, 1951-1965. Cambridge, MA: The [MIT SF] Society, 1966. 207p. Independent sequel to D.B. Day's Index to the SF Magazines 1926-50 (q.v.), limited to English-language material. Divided into a checklist of magazines indexed; an alphabetical listing of maga- zines and their contents chronologically analyzed; additional access is by story title and author. Period of coverage is identical to Metcalf (q.v.). Lacks information on series. No cross-references to pseudonymous works. Supplements 1966- have been com- piled by A.R. Lewis (q.v.) who is responsible for Strauss's checklist too. 3. Works on Primary SF Literature. A. On Titles in English or English Plus Other Languages.

Accompanied by a list of 37 fiction and non-fiction texts representing this interaction. Bishop, Gerald. New British SF &amp; Fantasy Books Published in Great Britain during 1968/69-. Lake Jackson, TX: J. Burger, 1970-. Supersedes Bishop's New SF Pub- lished in Great Britain: 1968, 1969 (1970). The first volume gives author listing only for both new and reprinted edns of SF material published in Britain. Publisher's information is part of each entry, inclusive of Standard Book Number. Later volumes incorporate a cross-listing by title and additions to signal certain types of material (juvenile, variant edns, hard or paper cover, etc.) Bleiler, Everett F. The Checklist of Fantastic Literature: A Bibliography of Fan- tasy, Weird, and Science Fiction Books Published in the English Language. Napierville, IL: FAX, 1972. 455p. Rpt. of 1948 edn. Fantastic prose literature after 1764 is listed by author in straight alphabetical sequence. Basic bibliographic information is provided with each entry. Pseudonyms are indicated in some cases, but omitted in others. There is a title index and a list of critical and historical reference tools, containing some scope notes. Still a basic tool, though the original errors (e.g. in dates and pseudonyms) and omissions have aged it heavily in the 1972 reprint. Supplemented by B.M. Day and George Locke's two addenda (q.v. all three). Bleymehl, Jakob. "Chronologie und Bibliographie," in his Beitrage zur Geschichte und Bibliographie der utopischen und phantastischen Literatur. Furth/Saar: Offizin</page><page sequence="6">276 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 5 (1978) Bleymehl, 1965, pp. 85-352. Extensive selective bibliography of and on world SF, with emphasis on rare, little-known, antiquarian titles, particularly strong in the pre-1900 material. Divided into chronological list (introduced by essays on aspects of the genre) from 800 BC up to the 1940s, and alphabetical author bibliography, with basic biblio- graphic data but no annotations. The author bibliography is subdivided into substantial primary and brief secondary book materials. There is an acknowledged discrepancy between the chronology and the bibliography, which does not include numerous 17th and 18th-century French utopias. A valuable checklist of German and foreign literature, especially for its treatment of scarce material. Blum, Irving D."English Utopias from 1551 to 1699: A Bibliography." Bulletin of Bibliography, 21 (Jan.-April 1955), 143-44. Chronological annotated bibliography of 26 basic titles published in Britain following the first English translation of Utopia. Recom- mended by Gibson and Patrick (q.v.) "despite inaccuracies." Burger, Joanne. SF Published in 1968-. Lake Jackson, TX: Compiler, 1969-. Useful series of mimeographed checklist of US SF and fantasy book titles. The main listing is by author and includes both hardback and paperback editions with full pub- lishing information. Cross-indexed by title. The 1968 and 1969 checklists went through two edns each, to include earlier omissions. Additional categories vary with each year, and range from separate listing for juvenile literature, anthologies, non-fiction, and poetry to publisher register and serialized stories. Information regarding pseudonyms is only available in the 1968 edns. Also lacking is distinction between new edns. and reprints. Clareson, Thomas D. "An Annotated Checklist of American Science Fiction: 1880- 1915." Extrapolation, 1 (Dec. 1959), 5-20. Preliminary listing of ca. 150 titles by "American-born" authors (plus "Canadian or European-born authors who published exclusively" in US) excluding "juvenile" SF. Descriptive annotations. Clareson, Thomas D. "Bibliography" in his The Emergence of American Science Fiction: 1880-1915. Diss. Univ. of Pennsylvania, 1956, pp. xvii-xxxi. Checklist divided into a larger section of primary sources and a selective listing of secondary titles of books and periodical material. Clarke, I.F. The Tale of the Future From the Beginning to the Present Day: An Annotated Bibliography of those satires, ideal states, imaginary wars and invasions, political warnings and forecasts, interplanetary voyages and scientific romances-all located in an imaginaryfutureperiod-that have been published in the UnitedKingdom between 1644 and 1970. London: The Library Association, 1972. 196p. Supersedes first edn. from 1961. Annotated list of ca. 1,200 entries arranged chronologically and containing publisher information but without city of publication or authors' full given names. With introductory essay, author and title indexes, and a short bibliography of secondary sources. Entries, limited to prose fiction without "juvenile fiction," include translations published in Britain and some British editions of US works. Cross-refer- ences are provided periodically for works written under a pseudonym, although omis- sions are in evidence. Entries are selected following Clarke's unclear definition of the utopian, political, and scientific "romance of the future." Clarke, I.F. "Bibliographies," in his Voices Prophesying War, 1763-1984 [sic]. Lon- don: Oxford University Press. 1966. pp. 213-49. Series of 3 separate bibliographies without annotations: A (213-16) is an alphabetical list of principal secondary works by author; B, "Select List of War Studies, 1770-1964," (216-26) is subdivided into three periods and then alphabetically by author; C (227-49) is a chronological "Check List of Imaginary Wars, 1763-1965" that covers British and US sources well, French and German sources less completely, and other languages only sparsely if at all. The main deficiency of this extensive list is its bibliographic stinginess: only rarely is the place of publication noted, and the publisher almost never. Cole, Walter R. A Checklist of SF Anthologies. New York: Arno Press, 1975. 374p. Rpt. of 1964 edn. Analytical index of other 200 anthologies published 1927-1963 in England and North America. Organized in four alphabetically arranged sections: a title</page><page sequence="7">GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SF LITERATURE 277 listing of anthologies, inclusive of editor; the principal listing of editor, accompanied by titles of anthologies, their publishing data and contents, and the magazine source in which they first individually appeared; a listing by the title of the story; and a listing by author. All sections contain cross-references. Same format is used for the supplement (1962-63) included under the same cover. A standard reference work. Collins, Len. Index to Fantasy and Science-Fiction Collections. South Porcupine, Ont.: Art Hayes for the N.F.F.F., 1970. 64p. Cross-index idem, ibidem: Hayes, 1971. 116p. Revised, expanded version superseding the 1961 index and based primarily on secondary sources. The arrangement is alphabetical by author, with the briefest of publishing information, followed by the titles of stories, novels, novelettes, poetry, or articles contained in each collection (i.e. anthology). Cross-index supplies additional access by title of each story. Many bibliographic inaccuracies. Crawford, Joseph H., James J. Donahue, and Donald M. Grant. "333": A Bib- liography of the Science-Fiction Novel. New York: Arno Press, 1975. 80p. Rpt. of 1953 edn. Brief synopses of 333 selected pre-1951 "Science-Fantasy" novels, grouped under eight frequently overlapping designations, defined by the compilers: Gothic romance, weird tale, SF, Fantasy, the lost race, fantastic adventure, unknown world, and the Oriental tale. Arrangement is alphabetical by author, with a title index ap- pended. Publication data are included, persumably for the first editions of works listed. Selection criteria are as unclear as the classification. Day, Bradford M. The Checklist of Fantastic Literature in Paperbound Books. New York: Arno Press, 1975. 128p. Rpt. of 1965 edn. Claims to be a comprehensive list of English-language paperbacks "with a sufficient tinge of the super-natural, or, the super-scientific." The coverage is predominantly American. The alphabetical listing by author includes information on publisher, date, and number of pages. One edn. is cited, with title variants noted for the first hardcover edn., ineptly referred to as "the Book." There are no cross-references to pseudonyms, variant series, edns, or even the British and U.S. version of the same edn. There is a supplemental listing by title. No indication of sources. Day, Bradford M. The Supplemental Checklist of Fantastic Literature. New York: Arno Press, 1975. 155p. Rpt. of 1953 edn. Includes some 3,000 items omitted in or published after Bleiler (q.v.), whose format is maintained but simplified to basic author listing and title index. Many mistakes in listings and very little SF content. Derleth, August. "Contemporary Science-Fiction." English Journal, 16 (Jan. 1952), 1-8.

Alhambra, CA: Fantasy Publishing Co., 1971, pp. 135-228. A series of lists, alphabetically arranged within categories and accompanied by substantial re'sume's of each title. The first list covers hardcover novels on Atlantis and Lemuria; titles not considered Atlantean by the author, although such content is implied; and magazine novels, novelettes, and short stories on Atlantis and Lemuria-all in the English language. The second list, devoted to foreign literature and organized by country, is without annotations and covers books on Atlantis in 15 languages. A bibliography of sources is included, as is a brief section on Atlantis in movies. Inadequate bibliographic citation and organization of unique information. Falke, Rita.

Annotations are mostly one-liners, indicating contents in the briefest of terms. "Utopian fantasy" is Gerber's term for social-science-fiction. Gibson, R.W., and J. Max Patrick, comp.

Gibson, St. Thomas More: A Preliminary Bibliography of his Works and of Moreana to the Year 1750. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1961, pp. 293-412. Excellent bibliographic overview of utopian materials including: 1) an introductory bibliographic essay on scope and methodology, with numerous brief citations not found in the third section; 2) a short-title list of British, German, and French reference sources, published mainly 1880-1940; 3) close to 200 selective book citations, extensive- ly annotated and with further references to related material, plus a listing of ca. 50 titles that contain references to More and his Utopia, the word utopia, and the genre of utopian literature. One of the most important bibliographies of utopian texts for 1500-1700. Gove, Philip Babcock.

The bulk of this chronologically arranged list is almost equally divided between English, French, and German titles, with other languages insufficiently covered and accounting for only 25 entries. Extensive annotations, with references to numerous bibliographic sources, give much useful background, mainly on publishing aspects. The checklist proper is introduced by a short-title index to the items describ- ed, arranged alphabetically by author (pp. 191-97). Following the checklist, a selective bibliography covers other related works, on the imaginary voyages in general or on two or more imaginary voyages. Indispensable both to bibliographer and general researcher, though by now badly in need of a supplement. Henkin, Leo J. "Problems and Digressions in the Victorian Novel (1860-1900)." Bulletin of Bibliography, 19 (May-Aug. 1948), 156-59; 21 (Jan.-April 1949), 202-05. Two parts out of a sequence of related bibliographies. Part XIII deals with the influece of the 19th-Century scientific discoveries on ca. 120 British novels of the period in two sec- tions: "Science and Pseudo-science," and "Utopia." Part XIV, dealing with the influence of psychic phenomena and further divided into fictional works on hypnotism and those on spiritualism and theosophy, is very little relevant to SF. Subject of each entry briefly described in annotations, which are often one-sided and at times not wholly trust- worthy. Hillegas, Mark. "Science Fiction as Satire: Selected Bibliography." Satire News- letter, 1 (Fall 1963), 20-22. Employing compiler-modified definitions of satire and SF, this is a partial checklist of novels, short stories and representative critical works of "professional" (i.e. commercial) postwar SF. Exceptional works are noted with an asterisk. Hutchinson, Tom. British Science Fiction and Fantasy. London: The National Bookleague, 1975. 52p.

It is preceded by a short chronological listing of about 20 influential titles published be- fore 1800. The bibliography proper includes 260 titles, divided into two parts: major books, represented by 216 titles, and some shorter writings, frequently serially pub- lished. Within the two divisions, entries are arranged alphabetically by author. Each annotation is divided into two sub-sections: the first part briefly indicates the subject and intent of the works whereas the second concentrates on the physical aspects of the edn(s) cited. An excellent tool for both the researcher and collector. Luna (formerly Luna Monthly), Nos. 1-64 (1969-76).

Selection criteria are unclear for it includes some revolutions, a World War novel, SF melodramas, etc. Annotations and data are not always reliable (the 1861 entry is from 1836). Selection is limited to titles available in the Imaginary Wars Collection at Colorado State University Libraries and lacks some titles from Clarke's bibliographies (q.v. both). Despite this, it can serve as a useful adjunct to them. Nolan, William F. "A Bibliography of Robot Fiction," in idem, ed. Pseudopeople: Androids in Science Fiction.

Selective bibliography of factual and fictional literature on "travel, adventure and SF," divided into broad chronological and topical divisions: about the early explorers of space, man's efforts to master Nature, mankind and future society, etc. Most entries are heavily annotated. SF criticism is included in a separate, albeit too brief section. Translations are also included, as is customary in Soviet bibliographies. Author and title index, an index of historical char- acters and a geographical and astronomical index make this guide, otherwise difficult to use, a useful bibliographical tool. Suvin, Darko.

Stuttgart: J. B. Metzler, 1974. XIII+94p. Individual sections in this lengthy bibliographic essay on utopian literature through the ages are accompanied by select unannotated primary and secondary titles. The latter contain books, articles, and dissertations (not distinguished from books). Titles are primarily in German and English, with some material in other European languages. Though the range of themes and topics is vast (theory, history of all times 4nd places, politico-economic and architectural aspects manifested in utopian litera- ture, forms, types, etc., including a scanty section on the secondary literature), the choice of titles is somewhat haphazard. No publisher and often no place of publication is indicated, and not all data are trustworthy. Nonetheless, a useful repository of out- of-the-way titles. *Clareson, Thomas [D.].

About 800 entries are covered in 9 subject categories designed to follow "the widely differing approaches to the genre": interdisciplinary writings, literary criticism, selective book-review materials (super- sceded by Hall, q.v.), literature dealing with SF in the non-print media, utopian literature, c:urriculum-oriented writings, publishing aspects, a special section on SF bibliographies (largely overlapping with Briney and Wood, q.v.), and finally selective bibliographical rnaterial on current representatives of SF writing and research. The criteria for compre- hensive coverage differ in individual categories, and are largely based on the avail- ability of identical or similar cumulated information in other sources of criticism. Titles not in English have been excluded. Many items are cross-referenced throughout.</page><page sequence="15">GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SF LITERATURE 285 Index of authors of items as well as of author-subjects is unnecessarily difficult to use as there is no continuous numbering. There is no title-index to articles, a number of articles have mistakes, annotations are at times idiosyncratic, the title should be "Criticism in English," and it partially overlaps with several other bibliographies avail- able. Nonetheless a valuable reference source, particularly for its multi-aspects coverage. *Dudley, Fred Adair. The Relations of Literature and Science: A Select Bibliography 1930-1967. Ann Arbor, MI: University Microfilms, 1968, 137p. Cumulation of annual bibliographies of secondary literature compiled between 1939 and 1967 by the ho- monymous MLA group, and since 1951 published in Symposium. Oriented toward the literary impact of scientific thought, the bibliography avoids history and philosophy of science as well as relations of literature and psychology. It is divided into: general studies, Antiquity and Middle Ages, Renaissance, 17th and 18th Century, 19th and 20th Century. These are further divided into general material pertaining to each period, and material on individual authors, indicated by marginal name headings. Entries are alphabetical by author of study and unannotated. Personal name index covers editors, translators, scholars, and critics cited. Articles prevail. Graaf, Vera. "Literaturverzeichnis," in her Homo futurus: Eine Analyse der moder- nen Science-Fiction. Hamburg and Duesseldorf: Claasen Verlag, 1971, pp. 217-32. Unannotated selective bibliography of and on modern SF with emphasis on the post- 1945 period, divided into primary and secondary sources. Primary literature lists British and American SF, plus 13 European titles. Secondary sources are more numer- ous and arranged in nine sub-sections, by topic or form; a number of Slavic items are included. Superseded by Rottensteiner (q.v.). *Hall, H.W. Science Fiction Book Review Index, 1923-1973. Detroit, MI: Gale Re- search Co., 1975. 438p. Comprehensive record of book reviews that appeared in the US SF magazines since 1929 (not 1923). As of 1970 also expanded for reviews in se- lected general literary and library periodicals and specialized fanzines. It is intended to provide access to reviews of SF literature, history, and criticism, SF bibliography, and reference tools. Close to 7,000 monograph titles are covered in approximately 14,500 citations. Basic arrangement is alphabetical by author of the works reviewed, subdivided by individual titles. In case of multiple edns, the publishing information is based on the earliest edn. available to the compiler. Following the main entry, references to reviews are listed under a unique code, with full bibliographical information. The basic listing is supplemented by a directory of magazines and the general-cum-fanzines category. The directory covers under each title the code, sequence of issues with corresponding dates, editor(s) if known, and basic SF indexes in which regular cita- tions appear from the title listed. Additional editors' index is followed by index to titles of the original works under review. This cumulation supersedes the first 4 annual vols. of Hall, SFBRI 1970-73 (q.v.); regrettably, the relationship is not made very clear in the retrospective volume. Although of great value for researchers, the index is entirely based on secondary sources and liable to numerous errors. *Hall, H.W. SFBRI: Science Fiction Book Review Index. Bryan, TX: The Compiler, 1970-. Annual guide designed to identify and provide bibliographic access to SF book reviews, both for primary and secondary literature. The first four volumes have been superseded by Hall's ...Index 1923-1967 (q.v.). Vol. 5, 1974 covers 1,310 books in 2,260 citations; its format is a simplified version of Hall's cumulative index. Directory of magazines provides identification of codes used to cover the source of reviews. The main arrangement is alphabetical by author, subdivided by title. Although a pub- lisher is given, dates are omitted in the annual sequences. Alternate access is available through title index. Vol. 6, 1975, covers 3,101 reviews of 1,474 books in the same format.

Skimpy listing of less than 20 "most useful" secondary titles with critical annotations. *Rottensteiner, Franz. "Literatur uiber Science Fiction: Eine Auswahl-Bibliographie," in Eike Barmeyer, ed., Science Fiction: Theorie und Geschichte. Muinchen: UTB-Fink Verlag, 1972, pp. 365-74. Selective but abundant listing of general SF criticism titles: over 20 standard reference sources; secondary historical, critical, and biographical sources divided into books and selective articles; and a brief mention of all periodicals featuring SF criticism and reprints. Items are predominantly in German and English, but the main Slavic, French, and Italian books are included. Ruttkowski, Wolfgang.

Bulletin of Bibliography, 31 (July-September 1974), 99-100, 106, 110, 116, 121. Retrospective of descriptive and critical material, unrestricted as to time or type of voyage. Individual author studies are limited to a group of voyage-related themes or a bibliography of essential significance to research. The straight alphabetical listing by author makes this useful bibliography slightly cumbersome, but coverage is comprehensive and includes special references to reviews of secondary sources. Scholl, Ralph., "Science Fiction: A Selected Checklist." Bulletin of Bibliography, 22 (Jan.-April 1958), 114-15. Critical articles in English dealing with "that imaginative fiction which is the result of extrapolations that take into account the so-called natural laws" from popular periodicals between September 1928 and May 1956. Excluded are SF magazines, fanzines, review articles, and SF film/TV criticism. Includes a very brief list of primary SF bibliographies. *Tymn, Marshall. "A Checklist of American Critical Works on SF: 1972-1973," Extrapolation, 17 (Dec. 1975), 78-96. Helpful supplement to Clareson's SF Criticism (q.v.), the checklist contains close to 150 annotated entries for books and critical articles published within the designated period in specialized SF journals, general litera- ture, library, and popular journals. Both general and individual author items are includ- ed, with full bibliographic information. Van Herp, Jacques. "Bibliographie," in his Panorama de la Science Fiction. Verviers: Ge'rard, 1973, pp. 407-30. Very selective bibliography divided into confusing cate- gories by period, geographical groupings, topics, and forms.
