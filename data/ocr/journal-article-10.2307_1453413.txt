<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SASSOON TREASURES THE BIBLICAL VERSE, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground," 1 comes to one's mind on visiting the book-laden scholar's haven that is the home of Rabbi Solomon David Sassoon. Here at No. I5 Sollershott East, in the Garden City of Letchworth, Hertfordshire, thirty-seven miles from London, reposes the world's greatest private collection of Hebrew manuscripts, priceless Scrolls of the Law, many incunabula, and I,290 Hebrew and Samaritan manuscripts including unpublished writings that cover a period of nearly a thousand years. The oldest manuscript is older than the British Museum codex 2 supposedly written between 820 and 850 C.E. There is hardly one facet of Jewish thought that is not well re- presented in the Sassoon collection. The student of art can feast his eyes on exquisitely illuminated manuscripts, Geniza fragments, machzorim, haggadot, marriage contracts, and other valuable docu- ments. Outstanding among them is the Farhi Bible (MS No. 368, Cat. pp. 6-I4) with more than 359 illustrations. On this biblical master- piece, consisting of I,056 fully vocalised and punctuated pages, illustrator Elisha b. Abraham Beneviste b. Elisha Crescas (b. I325) worked for some seventeen years. He began writing the book in I366 at the age of forty-one and finished it on Wednesday, Kislev I3, I383. It is one of the finest specimens of illuminated Bibles and of Hebrew calligraphy in existence. The author fully deserves the auto-dedication, "The work of my hands that I may be glorified." In addition to a list of haftorot for festivals and special Sabbaths, he includes plans of the Tabernacle and Noah's ark, lists of Chaldean, Persian, Greek, and Roman rulers, the names of biblical wives not mentioned in the Holy Writ, but found in rabbinic writings. (Amathelai, for example, was the mother of Abraham, and Naamah was the wife of Noah). Illustrated in Moorish-arabesque style are the seven walls of Jericho, musical instruments of the Temple, Aaron's rod, the jar of manna. The Farhi Codex is brief but eloquent testimony to the attainments of Spanish Jewry in the fourteenth century. 1 Ex. 3.5. 2 Oriental 4445, G. Margoliouth, Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan Manuscripts in the British Museum, London, I899, Vol. I, p. 36.</page><page sequence="2">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I37 Among the vast treasures of biblical codices is the remarkable "Shem Tob" Bible (MS No. 82, Cat. p. 2) one of the few known manu- scripts of the Bible in which the verses are numbered. Each parashah starts with verse one, and the verses of each book of the Prophets and the Hagiographa are counted separately. This 768-page codex, written in the fourteenth century by Rabbi Shem Tob ben Abraham Gaon, also has the geneology of the Exilarchs stretching back from Sar Shalom the Prince to Adam himself. At one time the manuscript was in the possession of the descendants of the Exilarchs in the East. Other great treasures include Maimonides' Arabic commentary on the second order of the Mishnah (MS No. 72, Cat. pp. 92-93), containing the first version of this work with the author's own corrections and additions. "I have never in my life boasted of not having made a mistake; just the reverse," Maimonides writes. "If I made either as my own or from other sources I always changed my views in my works as well as in my nature if I were convinced of my errors." 3I MS No. 73, (Cat. p. 93) is the third order of the Mishnah with the Arabic commen- tary of Maimonides in his own handwriting. It also has three signed glosses by Rabbi Abraham Maimuni ben Moses (II86-I236), the great commentator's son, probably written during the lifetime of his father. Of the six orders of the Mishnah there are now only five in existence: "Zeraim," "Nezikim," and "Kodashim" are held by the Bodleian Library, Oxford,4 and "Nashim" and "Moed" (I67 leaves) are in Sassoon's collection. Maimonides' note is revealing: "Know that I did not complete this work in order to strive for personal greatness among the Jews, nor in order to be glorified. God Almighty knows that I did not at first occupy myself with it except for my own purpose in order to find there ready what I wanted. Now, in my old age, which thank God I have reached, I have made an effort for the Lord, since I saw the nation without an acknowledged code free from errors and con- troversies, and therefore I did what I did for the glory of God." 5 The Machzor Vitry (MS No. 535 Cat. pp. 305-3I3) by Rabbi Simcha b. Samuel of Vitry (d. I003) is of great human interest. This twelfth century 596-page codex belonged to no less than twenty-one owners who each in turn, generation after generation, signed his name on the fly-leaf. The manuscript travelled form the Rhineland to Bohemia, where it belonged to a doctor in Prague by the name of Magister Zan- wil. During the persecution under the Emperor Ferdinand in I542, the members of the family settled in Cracow. "If this manuscript," sighed 3 "Some Maimonides Manuscripts," Jewish Chronicle, Lit.

Io8i) by a Yemenite scholar of the twelfth century is generally regarded as the first rabbinic work to emanate from Yemen. Ex- tremely valuable, too, is the Aramaic manuscript (MS No. 4I5 Cat. Pp. I12-I23) of the Sepher Sheiltot (The Book of Questions) of Ahai Gaon (c. 68o-c. 762) of Pumpedita. The manuscript, written in the twelfth century, consists of 256 pages. THE SASSOON DYNASTY "Oh East is East and West is west and never the twain shall meet," sang Rudyard Kipling, but this truism was falsified by the fortunes of the Sassoon dynasty. Founder David ben Sassoon (I792-I864) moved from Baghdad to Bombay, "the gateway to India," and laid the foundation of a vast mercantile empire stretching from Canton to Hong Kong, Turkey, Japan, Persia, England, Yokohama, and Naga- saki. His descendants left their manifold marks on Western Europe. Within a generation "the Indian Rothschilds" produced many colorful personalities. Of the eight sons and six daughters of David Sassoon, six settled in England. Albert Sassoon (I818-I896) was knighted by Queen Victoria. Sir Edward Sassoon (I856-I9I2) became Member of Parliament for Hythe Division, Kent, in I899. Reuben and Arthur Sassoon were made members of the Royal Victoria Order. Rachel, daughter of David and wife of Frederick Arthur Beer of Stratton Street, was editor of the rival newspapers the Observer and the Sunday Times. The Sassoons formed a cultural and social elite, and celebrities of the highest repute frequented the Sassoon mansions at Lancaster Gate, Belgrave Square, Kensington Gore, and the Shooting Lodge at Tulchan, Strathaspey. Even the Royal Family were on visiting terms, especially Edward the Prince of Wales, who was a frequent visitor. The third generation, too, made a notable contribution to British culture. Siegfried (Lorraine) Sassoon (b. i886), pacifist and literary editor of the Daily Herald, was a poet of note, recipient of the Haw- thornden Prize for I929. Philip Albert Sassoon (I888-I939) began his career as military private secretary to Sir Douglas Haig, Commander- in-Chief of the British armies in France during the First World War, 6 "The Book of the Month," Jewish Chronicle, Supplement No. I49, June, 1933.</page><page sequence="4">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I39 eventually becoming First Commissioner of Works and Trustee of the National Gallery, London. In the First World War, fourteen grandsons and great-grandsons of David Sassoon held commissions in the British Army.7 The bibliophile was David Solomon Sassoon (I882-1942). His mother Flora (I859-1936), daughter of Ezekiel Gubbay, of Baghdad, and granddaughter of Sir Albert Sassoon, married her relative, David Solomon Sassoon. For may years she engaged a rabbi with whom she maintained her Hebrew and rabbinic studies. She was, in the words of the late Chief Rabbi Herzog," a living well of Torah, of piety, of wisdom, of goodness and charity, of the staunchest loyalty to tradition, and out of her wonderful well, Israel could draw in abundance noble incentives and lofty inspiration." 8 Her fashionable Mayfair home (32 Bruton Street) was a meeting place for London's literati. She was a fine scholar herself. In December, I904, she presided at a lecture given by Marcus N. Adler, "On the Wandering Jews of the Middle Ages." On April, I3, I924, she presided at the annual "Speech Day" of Jews' College, London, where she delivered a learned discourse. An essay of hers on Rashi appeared in the Rosh Hashanah number of the Jewish Forum in October, 1930. She also wrote an essay on the number I3, which was based on forty- one references and appeared in the Jewish Forum in March, I931. Her son, David Solomon, "The Elkan Adler of the Sephardim" was one of the greatest Jewish book collectors and bibliophiles of the twentieth century. He learned "from early age," testified the late Dr. Isidore Epstein, principal of Jews' College, "to scorn delight and live laborious days. His life story is a real kiddush hashem, a veritable epic of consecration and dedication to God and his fellow men." 9 David Solomon was born in Bombay on December 8, i882. His father Solomon (i842-i894) died at the age of fifty-two. The widowed Flora took charge of her husband's business affairs, and supervised her son's education. In addition to his mother-tongue Arabic, he mastered English, Persian, and Hindustani, and at the age of eighteen knew the Bible by heart. In I902 Flora moved to London, where her home in the words of the London Daily Chronicle (March I7, I930) was "probably unique in the world." "She walked like a queen, talked like a sage, and entertained like an oriental potentate." 10 Bibliophile rather than businessman, David Solomon devoted his I Cecil Roth, The Sassoon Dynasty, London, I94I, p. 21I. 8 Jewish Chronicle, January 24, I936. 9 Ibid, August 2I, I942; see Meir Benayahuh, Masah Bavel, Jerusalem, I955. 10 Roth, op. cit., p. 329.</page><page sequence="5">I40 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW life to the accumulation of his great library. He inherited his great love of books from his great-grandfather Farja Hayyeem ben Abdullah Joseph, of Baghdad, whose large Hebrew library was partly destroyed when the Persians invaded Basra in I775.11 David Solomon's first acquisition, acquired in exchange for a kite in a boyish barter, was an Arabic translation of the Book of Ruth, printed in Bombay in I859 by David Hayyeem David. In I9I2 he married Sarah Selina, daughter of Moses Meir b. Rabbi Eliezer Lipmann Prins, owner of a famous library which later found a home in Jerusalem. David's first manuscript was a nineteenth century scroll of the Book of Ruth (MS No. i, Cat. p. 557) which belonged to one of his uncles, Abraham Shalom David Sassoon. This beautifully illuminated scroll contains the benedictions to be said before and after the reading of the Megillah. The young collector's first journey, in I902 from India to Damascus, bore choice fruit. He acquired the RSHBA Bible (MS No. i6, Cat. pp. I4-I5), a 951 codex written by the scribe Vidal b. Saul Satori on behalf of Astruc ben Isaac ben Solomon ibn Adret and finished in I383. The first word of each book is written in large gold letters on a colored background exquisitely illustrated. One exception is the Book of Lamentations, where as a sign of mourning color is omitted. Among the noted illustrations are those of the ark, the altar, the rod of Aaron, the menorah, and the Mount of Olives. To prove himself a Jew, David Sassoon was required by the owner of the manuscript to read certain portions and thus establish that his aims were bibliographic and not missionary. In I903 he bought for ; go a machzor on vellum (MS No. 23, Cat. pp. 289-293) which contained the liturgy for the whole year according to the Old Roman rite. Beautifully written in an Italian hand of the fifteenth century, the manuscript is illuminated with elegant borders of flowers, birds, animals, and biblical scenes. This work by the scribe Abraham b. Mattithiah Treves Safrati was utilized by liturgical writers like Samuel David Luzzatto (I800-I865) and Leopold Zunz (I794-I886). In I908 Sassoon paid a mere ; 30 for Maimonides' commentary on the Mishnah in Arabic, and for the "Shem Tob" Bible he paid only X 85. Two years later, visiting Baghdad, he purchased a small collection of manuscripts mostly from the seventeenth century. In Yemen, for a trifling five guineas he obtained Hdlachot Pesukot ("Decided Laws"), probably written in the ninth century by Yehudah Gaon. This manu- script (MS No. 263, Cat. pp. I23-I55) of 3I0 pages, complete with 11 A 32-page unpublished history of his collection entitled Me- Ohel Dawid and prepared for the Soncino Gesellschaft, p. 2.</page><page sequence="6">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I4I superlinear punctuation, was also known by the names of Hilchot Ketuot and Sepher Hilchot Katan. For more than ten years David patiently negotiated for the Farhi Bible. After a voluminous but non-conclusive correspondence, he went to Aleppo in I9I3, where finally on March 26 he acquired this coveted gem for ; 360. That year he paid ? I20 for the Arabic original of The Enclosed Garden (Ms. No. 4I0) by Rabbi Moses ibn Ezra (Io55- II35). This manuscript proves the author to be Rabbi Moses and not Abraham ibn Ezra (I098-II64), as many scholars had previously assumed. The work is divided into chapters. The first chapter defines reality; the second deals with the Unity of God; the third counsels the avoidance of anthropomorphism; and the fourth advises readers to avoid the name of the Diety. Ibn Ezra mentions more than fifty names of Geonim and grammarians, among them heretics like the Persian Bible exegete Hivi al Blakhi ibn Shakwiyah, who wrote a work con- taining 200 queries on the Bible. Recorded here is the saying of the founder of the Karaites, Anan ben David; "Search the Torah, and do not rely on thy knowledge." By I9I4 the Sassoon collection numbered 500 manuscripts. Between I914 and I932, when the Catalogue was published, the manuscripts grew to I,220, of which 1,I53 are fully described in the Catalogue. When David and his mother visited the Holy Land in I925, he acquired the Decisions of Rabbi Isaiah ben Mali di Trani the Elder (thirteenth century) on Hullin (MS No. 702, Cat. p. 697). In his North African odyssey he gathered prayerbooks with liturgies according to the rites of Algiers, Fez, Tlemenc, and Tunis. Other manuscripts came to him via private owners and famous booksellers like M. Lipshitz and David Frankel. He frequented public slaes and the auction rooms of Sotheby, and bought from the sales of Lord Amherst of Hackney, George A. Crawley, Lieutenant Lord Vernon, R. N., and the famous orientalist Silverster de Sacy. In I92I he acquired for ; 6o an 87I-page manuscript which is the complete talmudic compendium (MS No. 534, Cat. pp. I72-I93) by Mordecai ben Hillel (d. I298), the well known German codifier, who was martyred in Nuremberg. A particularly significant acquisition in September, I923, was the Diwan of Samuel Hanagid (MS No. 589, Cat. pp. 45I-460), which the Oxford University Press published with an introduction by Sassoon in I924. Samuel ha-Levi b. Joseph ibn Nagdela (993-I056) died ten years before the Norman Conquest. He was born in Cordova, and for a time was a spice-seller at Malaga. As a youth he emigrated to Granada, where he served the vizier of King Habbus of Granada. On his death bed the Vizier told King Habbus that he owed his success to his</page><page sequence="7">I42 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW secretary, who in I020 was appointed vizier. Until he died in I056, Samuel served King Habbus and his son Badis. Despite his concern with the weighty affairs of State, the Jewish vizier was a profilic writer who authored twenty books. He wrote grammatical works and an introduction to the Talmud. Moses Ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol, and Judah Alcharitzi (c. II70-c. I235) pay tribute to his creative poetic genius. Yet only fragments of Samuel's poetic writings are extant, some in the Leningrad Library, others in the Bodleian. The Diwan, which Sassoon acquired in Aleppo, was written in I584-5 by an Italian rabbi, Tam ben Gedaliah ibn Yachya, and was identified by Sassoon as the work of Samuel Hanagid. It contains I,743 poems, of which I,500 were previously unknown. They are divided into three parts called Ben Tehillim (pp. I-I46), Ben Mishli (pp. I47-300), and Ben Kohellet (pp. 303-374), after Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes respectively, and consisting of 203, I,I26, and 414 poems respectively. These poems not only establish Samuel as an outstanding poet but also shed new light on many facets of his every- day life. Ben Tehillim was collected by Samuel's son, Joseph, Ben Mishli, by another son, Eliasaph (b. I049); the compiler of the third part, however is not mentioned. We find a poem about the earthquake and eclipse of I047, and an elegy on the death of the Hai Gaon (939- I038), the last Gaon of Pumpedita, and on Rabbi Elhanan ben Hushiel of Kairouen. His son Eliasaph writes: "Say I, Yehoiasaph, son of the Nagid Rabbi Samuel the Levite, I collected in this book what came into my head of the poetical works of my father-may the Almighty raise him in honor. I wrote them out with my own hand when I was eight years and six months old, for I was born, according to the exact record of my father-may the Lord preserve him for good-three hours and threefifths of an hour and two-thirds of a fifth of the hour of the third night (Tuesday), Tishri II, 4796 in the year of the Creation (I033). This corresponds to the eleventh month Dhi Ka Dah in the year 426 according to the era of the Ishmalites, and I started with the compilation after Passover in the year 4804 (144)." 13 Another in- timate note, a warm human touch that rings true over the dead, dusty centuries, is revealed in poem No. 63: "My father-may God raise his honor-commanded me in my youth to copy a book, promising to give me a holiday for each poem. When he departed for one of the wars, I sent him what I had copied, and he wrote me these lines: 'Thy 13 The Newly Discovered Diwan of the Vizier Samuel Hannaghid, London, 1924: see also JQR, new series, Vol. XXI (July-October), 1930, Nos. 1-2, pp. 88-I50; also JQR, n.s., Vol. XXII (April, I932), pp. 4I7-428.</page><page sequence="8">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I43 writing is beautiful like chosen carbuncles, and its lines straight like embroidery on a mantle.'" In another poem we read about Ishmail ibn Abad of Seville, who fought the Vizier in a battle that took place on the thirteenth of Tishri. "I am in distress," grieves the poet, "and cannot multiply my sayings. Fulfil unto me the desire of my heart and hasten, I pray thee, to my help. And if I am not worthy before thee, do it for the sake of my son, Joseph, and for my Torah." It is not surprising that this Diwan was hailed as one of the great literary finds of our time. Sassoon recorded the prices paid for every item. From i888 to June I3, I919, he paid out a total of X 2,304 I35. 3d. for manuscripts I-507. After the First World War prices of manuscripts began to soar. In 1929 Sassoon paid X 1200 for MS No. I043, Cat. p. I084, the Halachic Code of Maimonides with glosses by Rabbi Meir Hakohen. The manu- script consists of i,o8o pages, and contains many variants from the printed text. He paid ; I,500 for the Guide to the Perplexed. The MS No. I047, (Cat. p. 996), consists of 496 pages, and has 229 illuminations. The lion represents the coat of arms of the royal family of Leon and Castile, for whom the manuscript must originally have been written. For a copy of the Latter Prophets (MS No. 1049, Cat. p. I092) he paid X 400. The manuscript ,written in a Spanish hand of the thirteenth or early fourteenth century, contains 44I pages. Yet these high prices were the exception rather than the rule. Sassoon was a careful buyer who obtained most of his treasures at almost nominal cost. Herbert Martin James Loewe (I882-I940) was inaccurate when he wrote in the Times Literary Supplement (April 27, I933, p. 294): "Unlimited re- sources enabled him to acquire any book that he desired, for no bidder could compete with him." Perseverance and true bibliographic zeal, rather than riches, were Sassoon's greatest assets. SUPERB CATALOGUE In I932 Sassoon published a two-volume catalogue of his collection, entitled Ohel Dawid. In these I,II2 pages (plus 276 pages of indices) he describes I,I50 manuscripts in learned yet lucid terms. The Catalogue, with its seventy-three illustrations, is a monumental piece of scholar- ship legitimately priced at twenty-five guineas a copy. The Catalogue contains quotations and minute literary and biographical details. The Indices, written in Hebrew, occupy 552 columns. They include a geographical index and a listing of some io,ooo works of poetry. The manuscripts are catalogued in fourteen logical sub-divisions. Among the biblical codices is the Merwas Bible (MS No. 508, Cat. pp. I-2), written by Joseph ben Judah b. Merwas in Toledo in the</page><page sequence="9">I44 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW I4th century. The British Museum manuscript (Or. 220I) was written by the same scribe. The statesman and biblical exegete Isaac Abra- vanel (1437-I508), in his commentary (Amos 5: I3) refers to this as "a model codex." Another valuable codex is the De Castro Pentateuch (MS No. 506, Cat. p. I9), an 840-page manuscript finished in I344, with the Pentateuch surrounded by Targum Onkelos and the commen- tary of Rashi. The Book of Esther has an illustration of a huge tree with Haman and his ten sons, all dressed in many colorful costumes, hanging from the branches. There are many midrashic commentaries on the Pentateuch and haftorot as well as excellent copies of Rashi's commentary to the Petateuch and Hagiography, Arabic translations and explanations of Saadia Gaon's (882-942) Ten Commandments (MS No. 269, Cat. p. 6i), and Geniza fragments of his Arabic translation of various books of the Bible (MS No. 529, Cat. p. 6i). There are many texts of the commen- taries of Rashi (MS No. 344, Cat. p. 73), Kimchi (MS No. I39, Cat. p. 73), Bachya b. Asher ibn Halaway (MS No. 40, Cat. p. 73), Rabbi Menachem ben Benjamin Rekanati (MS No. 67, Cat. p. 74), Jacob ben Asher (MS No. 46i, Cat. p. 75), and Sepher Moshav Zekenim (MS No. 409, Cat. p. 75), a superb commentary on the Pentateuch by Samuel b. David, in which the author used I43 authorities. In addition to valuable midrashic texts, the collection has a number of tenth century mishnaic fragments (MS No. 523, Cat. p. 9I) and tractate Pesachim of a Babylonian Talmud of the fifteenth century (MS No. 594, Cat. p. 98), in which Bible quotations are vocalised and punctuated. There is also a Geniza fragment (MS No. 526, Cat. p. ioi) of stories from the Talmud, with Arabic translation. A unique com- mentary on the tractates "Berachot," "Peah," and "Dmai" of the Palestinian Talmud (MS No. 592 Cat. p. I04) quotes such commentators as Rashi, Joseph Caro, Samson ben Abraham of Sens (c. II50-I2I6), and Obadiah (Yare) of Bertinoro (c. I450-C. I5IO). Outstanding among the many monumental works of Maimonides is his Halachic Code (MS No. 417, Cat. pp. I56-8) written in the fourteenth century, which has been acclaimed as a "magnificent example of Hebrew calli- graphy." The responsa literature too, is well represented, covering a period of nearly 8oo years from the Geonic responsa of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi and Rabbi Joseph ben Meir Halevi ibn Migash (Io77-I4I) (MS No. 593, Cat. p. I97) to the letter dated Tevet I4, I914 (MS No. 5I9, Cat. p. 205), addressed to the Sephardic rabbinate in Jerusalem. This letter refers to intermarriage with the Benei Israel, who did not practice the rab- binic law of divorce and halitzah. The collection is particularly rich in liturgical manuscripts. Twenty-</page><page sequence="10">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I45 four different rites, ranging from Avignon to Yemen and from Persia to Corfu, illustrate differences in synagogue services. The illuminated Passover Haggadot (MS No. 5II, Cat. p. 22I; MS No. 584, Cat. p. 223; MS No. 504, Cat. p. 223), demonstrate that the Jews were never de- ficient in artistic talent. Among the favorite subjects for the illustrators were Moses and Aaron, Moses before the burning bush, the four sons, Moses in the bulrushes, the ten plagues, Moses and the Israelites at the shore of the Red Sea, and Moses smiting the Egyptian. The liturgies reveal local customs. Thus, the Avignon rite has a special poem for the Pope and his officials. The Algiers rite records the practice of cele- brating a special Purim on Heshvan 4th in memory of the deliverance in I542. The North African rite contains elegies in memory of Jews harshly expelled from Spain and Portugal. The Carpentras rite con- tains poetic additions in the middle of the Amidah (MS No. 4i6, Cat. p. 254). The Roman rite incorporates a special service for the fast day held in Rome on Thursday, Sivan 2I, I32I, when representatives of the Jewish community visited the Vatican. The Sephardic rite lists special blessings for the celebration of a wedding between a widow and a widower. The Ashkenazi rite is represented by eight different manuscripts, some of them illuminated. The liturgies of Asti, Fossano, and Moncalvo (the French ritual which was discarded with the expulsion of the Jews from France in the fourteenth century, and was retained only by these three communities) have never appeared in print. A study of the Yemen rite reveals that the Yemenites were influenced by Persian Jewish usages, for instance the Yemenite ritual Tachlal, a fusion of Saadia's and Maimonides' orders. Vows played a great part in the religious life of the Bene Yisrael. In addition to the Diwan of Samuel Hanagid, there are poetic paraphrases of the Pentateuch (MS No. 6I7, Cat. p. 473) and other Biblical books (MS No. 6I4, Cat. p. 473) by the Judeo-Persian poet Shahin in the thirteenth century. He wrote on biblical themes in imitation of the Persian Book of the Kings of Firdausi, Shahin dedicated his works to the members of a leading f amily of Persia who acted as his Maecenas; namely, Ezekiel, called Khawajah Shams el Dim ben Ithamar. Shahin's manuscripts are enriched with illustrations of events and scenes described in the poems. His poetical paraphrases of the Books of Joshua, Ruth, and Samuel are unique. In the Sassoon collection there are ten manuscripts of Arabic folk songs, Jewish Per- sian songs, and Jewish Arabic stories of the Thousand and One Nights. One fragment (MS No. 4I9, Cat. p. 482) contains the stories of the 778th and 783rd nights. The historical writings throw light on many dark periods of Jewish</page><page sequence="11">I46 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW history. The statutes of the Jewish exiles from Castille who settled in Fez, I545-I7I4, form interesting documents on the social conditions in North Africa. The Takkanot of Candia describe Jewish life in the thirteenth century. People who think "rent control" is of recent origin would do well to study the ordinances, many centuries old, of the Island of Crete. "First we have ordained," quotes the Synod in I228, that henceforth no Jew shall be pernmitted for any reason to offer a higher rental for any house which is rented to another, without the consent of the tenant." 14 Other ordinances are meant to counteract the laxity of religious observance and worship. "Whereas we have seen that some of our people cast aside the righteous path, and on the eve of the Sabbath or Festival continue at their work until the setting of the sun, and their eyes and their hearts are set on the completion of the task in which they are engaged .. . therefore do we ordain and decide, under the penalty of excommunication, that no one of our community, whether male or female, shall be permitted to do any work after midday on the Sab- bath eve." 15 Religious worship, also neglected by some Jews, was deplored by the leaders of the community in terms which have a striking contemporary tone. "Many of us, at the time of prayer on Sabbaths, New Moons, Festivals, and appointed seasons, go about through the vineyards, gardens, and orchards; some of us turn towards the shore of the sea, to boats; and some of us go rather to the law courts, or even on the streets and in the market places, meandering uselessly, merely follow- ing the desires of the heart, satisfying the bodily cravings which pass away and are lost." 16 High standards of morality were demanded. "Our ancestors had the custom that no affianced man should pass the house of his betrothed until the time of the huppah. Even if they met on the street, they would turn in opposite directions. But it happened recently within ten years, that this regulation has broken down. Men of Belial have broken the hedge made by the forefathers, and have been so light-headed as to enter the house of their future fathers-in-law, and eat and drink there. It often happens as a result that indiscretions are committed, and this has led even to an attempt at abortion and to infant murder. There- fore, have we all agreed to bring the matter back to its original custom, 14 MS No. 407, Cat. p. 349; Hoffmann Festschrift, p. 267: Louis Finkelstein, Jewish Self Government in the Middle Ages, New York, I924. p. 276. 15 Ibid. p. 277. 16 Ibid. p. 278.</page><page sequence="12">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I47 that henceforth no affianced young man shall be permitted to enter the house of his father-in-law until the performance of the huppah. If for some compelling reason he must enter the house, he shall be obliged to take along two of the officers who will be appointed to look to the execution of these ordinances, or any two other people with him." 17 Nor were business ethics ignored. "We have further agreed," states the ordinance 18 "that no member of our community, whether young.or old, shall be permitted to lie to gentiles or to deceive them, whether in regard to what Jews buy from them or in regard to what Jews sell them." Manuscripts dealing with the history of the Jews in Cochin and Baghdad date back to the foundation of the city of Baghdad in 762. Fascinating facts emerge about religious and intellectual life, and about such colourful personalities as Sherira Gaon (906-I006) of Pumpedita, his son Hai Gaon, and Rabbi Saul ben Hofni, father-in-law of Hai Gaon, (d. I038) who spent many years there. Diaries, correspondence, marriage contracts (ketubot), and memoirs, provide meaningful insight into the customs and attitudes of changing times. There is a letter written by the pseudo-messiah, Judah ben Shalom, known as Mari Shalom Kohali (MS No. 26, Cat. p. 404), dated Iyar I7, I870, to Moses Enoch Hallevi of Aden. The one-time potter or cobbler decided that he was the Messiah. He maintained that the words in Isaiah 44, "to His annointed, to Cyrus," was a mistake, and should be "To His annointed, to Shooker." He wrote a letter to D. J. Ezra, of Calcutta, commanding him to pay a tithe of all his possessions."' In this letter the pseudo-messiah wrote: "I will send them a reply when my lord Elijah-may he be remembered for good- will give me permission to do so, for they have asked me to perform signs and wonders and to send them my replies by a flying bird. But I have no power at present to do so . . . God-may He be blessed-has forbidden me, and now if I do perform a sign or a wonder, there may be trouble for Israel. But be informed and infer that the time of the salvation is near, and thine eyes shall see miracles. With regard to what you mentioned (in your letter) about the building of the Temple, know thou, my brother and the beloved of my soul, that shortly we will all go up to Zion and will all be glad and rejoice in the building of the chosen House. As to what Rabbi Jacob Saphir wrote in his letter, that the Messiah is going to appear in the Chamber of the Hewn Stone (lishchat hagazit), surely there is no Beth Din sitting there, and 17 Ibid. p. 279. 18 Ibid. p. 280. 19 "An Autograph letter of a Pseudo-Messiah," Jewish Quarterly Review, N.S., XIX, I907. pp. i62-67.

In three letters dated November-December, I87I (MS No. 538, Cat. P. 400), Sir Moses Montefiore (I789-I885), president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews (I838-79), implores Reuben D. Sassoon to relieve the sufferings of Persian Jewry. The Sassoon collection contains valuable cabbalistic and philosophic works. In the lexiographical section are the Rabbinical Lexicon (MS No. 923, Cat. p. 49I) of Rabbi Nathan ben Yechiel of Rome (c. I035- IIO6); a fragment of an Arabic Hebrew Lexicon (MS No. 542, Cat. p. 492); a Hebrew Persian Dictionary (MS No. 7IO, Cat. p. 500) by Solomon b. Samuel of Gurganji; and an abbreviated Hebrew Italian Dictionary (MS No. 936, Cat. p. 50I). There is a special section for tombstone inscriptions, many of them meticulously copied out by Sassoon himself in the course of his travels. Among particularly noteworthy inscriptions are those of the shrine of the Prophet Ezekiel at El Kifil (near Hillah); of Ezra the Scribe at El-Ozeir, near Bsara (Cat. p. 569); of Rabbi Isaac Gaon (Cat p. 570); and of the cemeteries of Bene Israelites, Calcutta, Cochin, Bombay, Poona, and Surat. Sassoon was fortunate enough to acquire some seventy Samaritan manuscripts, consisting of Bibles, Arabic translations of Samaritan Bibles, conxmmentaries on the Pentateuch, treatises on the accents of Samaritan Pentateuch liturgies for the Sabbath and holidays, and compendia of laws. Other Samaritan writings include a genealogy of Samaritan High Priests (MS No. 389, Cat. p. 596), Samaritan marriage documents, and a treatise on the calendar (MS No. 722, Cat. p. 60I). NOT IN THE CATALOGUE The publication of the manuscript catalogue spurred Sassoon to gather yet more treasures. Between I932 and I940, he acquired inter- alia Midrash Haggadol on Genesis and Exodus (MS No. II66-67), on Numbers (MSS Nos. ii68 and II90), and on Deuteronomy (MS No. II69); copies of Ein Yaakov (annotated compilation of the aggadic section of the Talmud) by Jacob ibn Habib I460-I5I6 (MSS Nos. II70 and II71); copies of Yad Hachazakah (MSS Nos. II79 and II80-83), liturgies and scrolls. On November 5, I930, he bought for ? 288 6s. 6d. a Bible which originated from a monastery in Montserrat, Spain. This fifteenth century codex consists of 582 pages punctuated with vowels and accents, and with some beautiful illustrations. Sassoon paid ? 3I5 Isa. for a copy of the Latter Prophets (MS No. I209). This codex too is complete with vowels and accents, and illuminated initials of delicate</page><page sequence="14">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I49 workmanship overwrought in gold and many colors. In I939 Sassoon acquired, for ? 3I, the five-volume commentary (MSS Nos. I263-67) on the Pentateuch by Rabbi David Hannagid Sassoon. His last ac- quisition, MS No. I274, which he bought in London on June ii, I940, was a Passover Haggadah according to the Ashkenzi rite. In the last two decades, I942-I946, only sixteen items were added by his son. Among the notable additions were Nos. I28I-2, acquired in I955 for ? ioo, the novellae on Tractate Ketuboth by David Oppenheimer, and a Marriage and Circumcision Register kept by the Rev. Saul S. D. Cohen from Tishri 30, 565I. This was acquired from S. Howard of Calcutta on November 8, I960, for the sum Of ? 37 IOs. INCUNABULA The Sassoon collection has many books printed in the first half- century of printing. Among these rare books is the first edition of the Psalter, dated I477, and printed in Bologne. The colophon says that only 300 copies were printed. "For He who has prospered us in all that we have put our hands from the beginning to the end. On the 20th day of the month of Elul in the year 237 (August 29, I477) our work was finished. May the Rock of our strength hasten our Redeemer speedily in our days. This is the prayer of those who executed the printing, via Master Joseph and Neriah Chayim Mordecia and Ezekiel of Ventura." With the exception of Psalm I, 4, and 5, which have vowel points, the text is without vowel signs and accents. There are no fewer than of io8 omissions of whole verses.20 The edition princeps of the prophetical books with the Targum of Onkelos and Rashi's comnmentary, printed in I482, is another rare copy in the Sassoon collection. It also has the editio princeps of the Prophets printed by Soncino, I485-86, in two volumes. The colophon reads: "Verily it was finished in the year 5246 of the creation of the World, on the sixth of the month of Marcheshvan (October I5, I485), here at Soncino in the province of Lombardy, which is under the govemrnent of the powerful Duke of Milan." Volume I, "The Former Prophets," consists of i68 unpaged folios. One colum gives the Hebrew text, the other contains the commentary of David Kinxhi. Volume II, "The Latter Prophets," consists of 290 folios. The third edition of the Pentateuch, known as the Pentateuch Ixar, printed in I490, consists of 264 leaves without pagination. Each folio has three columns. The middle column exhibits the Hebrew text, the left column gives the Aramaic version, and the right column contains 20 C. D.

Sassoon is the proud possessor of the last three books of the Pentateuch, i.e., Volume II of the "Lisbon" Pen- tateuch printed in I49I. "It was finished," states the colophon "at Lisbon in the year 25I (I49I) in the month of Ab." Another rare book is the second edition of the Bible in Naples, I49I-93, which consists of 433 paged leaves, and whose text is provided with vowel points and accents. Another collecor's item is the first edition of the Pentateuch of Bologna I48a. The colophon reads: "And the Lord stirred up the spirit of the noble, intelligent, and wise, the great master Joseph Caravita ... He engaged the most skilled and experienced man in that art ... His name is known in the gates, Master Abraham-the Lord preserve him-the son of Rabbi Chaim de Tinteri, of Pozaro." Other collector's items are the commentaries on the Torah by Abraham ibn Ezra (Naples, I488), Moses ben Nachman (Lisbon, I489), Levi b. Gerson Gersonidos (Mantua before I480); Noffet Zuffim by Judah ben Jechiel, of Mantua, printed by Abraham Conat before I480; and two copies of Agur by Rabbi Jacob b. Judah Landau, a German-Italian codifier who lived in the second half of the fifteenth century. The Agur was the first Jewish book to be printed during the author's lifetime, and the first book to contain a rabbinical approbation. The bibliographer Aron F. Freimann (I87I-I948) lists I65 books printed on vellum. The Sassoon collection holds twenty-four such vol- umes. Among them are the lexicon, Sherashin, by David Kimch (Naples, 1490), and the Zohar by Simeon ben Yochai, with a decision by Isaac ben Immanuel de Lattes in three volumes printed in Mantua, ISS8-6o. Among Sassoon volumes not even mentioned by Freimann are Prayer Book, Venice, 1527; Mishneh Torah of Moses ben Maimon, Part III, Venice, I550-51; and Haggadah with Abravanel's com- mentary, printed in Wilhermsdorf, 1715.21 PRINTED BooKs "I hope that after finishing with the printing of my Catalogue of Hebrew and Samaritan manuscripts," wrote David Sassoon, "I will find leisure in cataloging or at least indexing my printed and litho- graphical books." 22 Unhappily he never found time to carry out this project. The Sassoon collection is particularly rich in books printed in the East. It contains 298 Hebrew and Arabic publications printed in Baghdad, from the oldest Haggadalx printed by Rahamim ben Hakham Reuben ben Hakham Mordecai and Company in I862 to the latest 21 A.

In the Baghdad Hebrew newspaper edited by Baruch Moses Mizrachi, which appeared as a bi-monthly from i868 to I871, are records of the con- secration of the Ohel Dawid Synagogue in Poona, and of the appearance of the pseudo-messiah Mari Yahya Mayyeeum Sherabi. Also in the Sassoon library are seven of the Hebrew publications published in Bombay by Mari Eleazar ben Aaron ben Seadya Iraki, a native of Yemen, and i99 books printed in Calcutta. Among them is an Indian drama in Hindustani which was printed in Calcutta before i88o. This is the only Hebrew illustrated book printed in Calcutta.23 Sassoon possesses igg Calcuttal publications.24 Among 148 publications from Bombay is a unique copy of a news- paper, the only issue to appear in print, which emerged on the Tishri 30, I885, to promise its readers "some very useful articles on medical science, as well as the wonderful and hitherto unknown curing pro- perties of certain plants." Poona produced ten works ,and all are in the Sassoon collection.25 There are also 260 volumes dealing with the life and literature of the Jews in Cochin. Sassoon gathered some valuable material on the Jewish community of Kai-Fung Foo. In an unpublished letter dated Heshvon 25, I856, we read: "I am Isaac Farja, the son of Reuben Jacob from Baghdad, and I came to the city of Shanghai in the year 5606. I have heard that there are Israelites in your city, and I am very pleased to be cognizant of your welfare, and to send you a letter so as to hear news of joy and happiness in your city; and I beg you to send me a reply to what I ask you. Let me know: Is there a scroll of the Law in your city? Do you read the Haftorot from the Prophets? Do you possess the Four-and-twenty Books of the Bible, and do you possess the Mishnah and the Zohar ? In what books do your children learn ? And from what tribe are you ? I beg you to excuse the trouble I am putting you to, and I request you to answer me, and further, to tell me all about your city, and let me know if there is another city wherein Israelites are to be found. And if you wish to have anything from me, such as Pen- tateuchs, Prophets, Hagiographia, and any other books. I have faith in His Name-may He be blessed-that He will fulfil your wishes and I will send you an answer and whatever else you wish for.

Maiiv of these were collected by Reuben D. Sassoon, and exhibited in the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall in London, I887. Among the exhibits were bells for scrolls of the Law, crowns, Passover dishes, etrog boxes, Hannukah lamps, scrolls of Esther, reading desk covers, binders for scrolls of the Law, eighteenth century shofrot and amulets. THE BIBLIOPHILE'S FAREWELL After the Austrian anschluss (March II-12, 1938), when Austria ceased to exist, and stormny war clouds hovered over Europe, Sassoon began to disperse his library. In his diary he noted, on April i i, 1938: "I was afraid lest the Nazis bombard London. I felt it my duty to preserve my manuscripts. I took a number of them to Winchester Safe Deposit, Broad Street, London. I placed them in the strong room. I embraced and kissed them, and I reflected whether I should ever set my eyes on them again." Five sealed cases were sent to the National Library of Wales at Aberyswyth, where they were kept together with the manuscript of Corpus Christi Church in Cambridge. On April 12, 1939, Sassoon wrote to the librarian: "I have heard from Messrs. Magg Brothers, Ltd., that you miost kindly consented to accept the custody of about twenty of my manuscripts." Unhappily Sassoon's premonitions were well warranted: he never saw his manuscripts again. Bombed out of his London home, he settled in Letchworth, where he threw himself with heart and soul into the task of helping refugees and other war victims. In one of his last letters, addressed to the London Jewish Chronicle (May 22, 1942), he stated: "I have just received a letter from India dated March 17. It mentions that the synagogue in Rangoon, Burma, has been burnt down by enemy action, and that ninety-one Holy Scrolls of the Law have been destroyed." Sassoon died on the Av 27, I942, at the age of sixty-one. His remains were later interred in Jerusalem, on Nisan I3, I947. His son Solomon David, who was awarded semichah by Rabbis Eliezer Dessler, Chief Rabbi Herzog, and Shem Tob Gaguine, reassembled the famous 26 "Inscriptions in the Synagogue in Kai-Fung-Foo," Jewish Quar- terly Review, N.S., Vol. XI., I920, pp. I27-I44.</page><page sequence="18">SASSOON TREASURES-RABINOWICZ I53 Sass oon collection. Two copies of early editions of Cicero were pre- sented by him to the National Library of Wales at Aberyswyth, in return for the custody of his father's treasures. Rabbi David Solomon Sassoon published his father's work on the history of the Jews of Baghdad, and also edited MS No. 409, moshav Zekenim (London, i95g), and the Bodleian manuscript (i66) of the commentary of Rabbi Abraham-Maimuni on Genesis and Exodus (London, I958), as well as one volume of a projected three-volume edition of the original manus- cript of Maimonides' commentary on the Mishnah. Volume j 27 covers the section "Zeraim" and "Moed". It contains the full text of Mai- monides' commentary written in Arabic but in Hebrew characters, with a 56-page introduction in English by Sassoon. Sixty years ago David Solomon Sassoon dreamed a dream, and today and tomorrow this dream may find fulfilment. For in the introduction to the Catalogue the passionate bibliophile wrote these words: "One may hope that the tent of David, will be like the tent of our forefather Abraham, which was open on all four sides so as to receive travelers from afar who are hungry and thirsty for the word of God." 27 Maimonides, Commentarium in Mischnan, Vol. I, Ejnar Munks- gaard, Copenhagen, I956.
