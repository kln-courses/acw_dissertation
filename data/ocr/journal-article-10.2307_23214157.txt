<plain_text><page sequence="1">Linguistics edited by Stacey Katz Bourns Burguy, Georges Frédéric. Grammaire de la langue d'oil ou grammaire des dialectes franqais aux XII' et XIII' siècles suivie d'un gìossaire. Vol. 1. Munich: Lincom, 2011. ISBN 978-3-8628-8035-5. Pp. xiv + 409. 74,10 €. At a time when young scholars with something to say are finding it increas ingly difficult to publish, the German publisher Lincom has chosen to reproduce verbatim, and at a hefty price, the first of three volumes of a work dating to the 1850s—the first edition of Burguy's long-forgotten grammar of Old French. In its catalogue, Lincom identifies this volume by three key terms: "historical linguis tics/' "language documentation," and "sociolinguistics." The third would appear to be wishful thinking; the other two are certainly more accurate. In fact, it is as a source of language documentation that Burguy's first two volumes are probably most useful today (except for those engaged in the historiography of Romance linguistics), while the third volume has value as a dictionary of Old French. After a thoughtful introduction, this volume presents chapters on derivation (21-44), the article (45-62), the noun (63-99), the adjective (100-07), numbers (108-20), the pronoun (121-97), and the verb (198-409). Burguy's goal in writing his Grammaire was to provide for the first time an "ouvrage complet, propre à faire connaitre les lois qui [...] régissaient [...] les divers langages parlés en France, au nord de la Loire, dans une partie de la Belgique et de la Suisse, depuis le IXe jusqu'au XIVe siècle" (iii). While many nineteenth-century grammars of French (and Occitan too, for that matter) adhere to Latin-based criteria, Burguy takes in stead apophony (as applied by Grimm to the Germanic languages) as his key to unraveling the complexities of the Old French verb. The use of "weak" and "strong" and other such anthropomorphic terms attests to the positivist world view embodied here. For Burguy, a form like the present tense expressing dura tion would be represented by "une forme longue et forte" (emphasis mine), while tenses expressing something momentary are represented by "une forme simple et courte." Where the Romance languages show a somewhat altered pattern, Burguy concludes: "le génie des peuples avait changé" (199). On the same page we read that "chaque langue est soumise à la loi de l'unité et de l'équilibre." A re liance on pre-Neogrammarian "laws" informs the entire approach taken by Burguy. While it may have been considered a standard source in its day, and while he</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 1217 was evidently the first to undertake such a comprehensive view of the dialectes d'oil, his is a work that has not fared particularly well in the annals of historical Romance linguistics. This is a study written when it was still necessary to refute that French derived from Hebrew. Suffice it to say that, while Diez's Grammatik der Romanischen Sprachen (1836) has endured to this day as a pioneer work in Romance linguistics, Burguy's oeuvre has not. The three editions of his work do testify to some measure of publishing suc cess. In any case, when a need arises to take a look at any part of Burguy's Grammaire, the curious Internet scholar has other choices, most notably Google books and the Bibliothèque nationale de France. On Google, with a bit of careful hunting, all three volumes of the third edition (1882) can be located and read on line, or downloaded for free in a variety of formats. The BnF's Gallica service also makes it possible to download all three volumes of the second edition. Should one need a print copy at a reasonable price, however, one might also consult Nabu Press through Barnes and Noble. Granted that there are few differences between the editions (1853-56, 1869-70, and then 1882), one is hard-pressed to understand the need for this new reprint of the first volume alone.
