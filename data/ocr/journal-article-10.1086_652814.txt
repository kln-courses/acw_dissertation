<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> JULIET KINCHIN Performance and the Reflected Self:  Modern Stagings of Domestic Space,  1860-1914  Since the late nineteenth century the themes of identity formation,  psychological interiority, authenticity, and voyeurism have been central  to discussions of the modern home—whether or not they have been  labeled as such.1 Frequently such issues have been articulated in relation  to metaphors of performance and reflection, which offer useful ways of  considering the dreamlike, irreal dimensions of domestic experience.2  This exploration of the shifting, permeable boundaries between psycho- logical and corporeal space considers a series of different "reflections" of  identities and "stagings" of experience within the modern British inte- rior, ranging in time from the 1860s to 1914- Inevitably there is a complex interplay between representation and  the spatial practices of inhabitation. The private enactments, reveries,  and fleeting intimate encounters discussed here have been reified for  public consumption and collective memory in a variety of forms—in  paintings (by James McNeill Whistler and Walter Sickert), cartoons  (George Du Maurier and Eliza Haweis), novels (Margaret Oliphant and  Catherine Carswell), or actual room settings (Charles Rennie Mackin- tosh and Margaret Macdonald). These modes of representation present  alternative modes of entering the complex aesthetic, symbolic, and  spatial world of the interior. Taken together, however, there is an  intertextual resonance between these imaginary and actual spaces which  are otherwise removed from each other in time and place. There is a  shared use of symbolic narrative and expressive conventions that suggests  a dialectical exchange among the viewers, the inhabitants, and their  environs. At the heart of these and other representations of the modern  interior during the period c. 1860-1914 is the somewhat paradoxical  tension between intimacy and publicity. While engaging with the inte- riors of the private home, the viewer also enters the public spaces of the  exhibition gallery, the magazine, and the artist's house. In this sense the  position or identity of the spectator adds to the already ambiguous  interchange between the authorial identities of the artist, the interior  designer, and those who once dwelled in the domestic spaces.

Stage arts were lively, flourishing in diverse  forms, from old-fashioned melodramas, burlesques, productions of Shake- speare, pageants, musical reviews, concerts, and modern dances, to the  problem plays of Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw, while the  drawing room itself often provided a setting for amateur dramatics,  tableaux vivants, and musical soirées. The Victorian theater was in many  senses a "home away from home" that deployed a shared knowledge of  furnishing conventions, on stage and off,4 and designers such as E. W.  Godwin, who, in the face of increasing specialization within the arts,  aimed for unity in cultural production, brought aspects of his theatrical  work into his architecture and interior design. Actresses such as Lillie  Langtry, Sarah Bernhardt, and Elsie de Wolfe all moved with ease from  the stage into the related sphere of interior decoration-5  At a practical level, the individual artists, designers, and authors  discussed here were all involved professionally in the performing arts to  a greater or lesser extent. Being seen at the theater was an important  element in Whistler's construction and "performance" of his public  persona, and, through his close association with E. W. Godwin and  Godwin's companion, the actress Ellen Terry, he was drawn into the  world of drama criticism, production, and performance.6 Within Aes- thetic Movement circles modern life itself was viewed as an art form, a  special way of being, a new form of sociability. George Du Maurier's  caricatures of Aesthetic Movement interiors, for example, informed the  staging of satirical musicals like Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience (1881).7  Walter Sickert worked on and off as a professional actor, and drew on  music hall culture in his art. "A painter is guided and pushed by his  surroundings very much as an actor is," Sickert wrote in 1910, "and the  atmosphere of English society has provided a school with aims and  qualities altogether different from those of the Impressionists."8 At  around the same time Mackintosh and Macdonald helped to stage a  number of pageants and participated in them: in 1898 Mackintosh  articulated the spatial relationship between audience and performers in  his design for an auditorium (part of a competition entry for the site of  Glasgow's 1901 International Exhibition) and his last recorded commis- sion (1920) was a theater for Margaret Morris, a pioneer of avant-garde  dance in Britain.9  </page> <page sequence="3"> 66 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  Like the metaphor of the theater, mirrors were metaphors for an  intensified concern with "sincerity," the nature of visual appearances,  and the perceived erosion of boundaries between people and things. The  reflected images contained within the mirror's frame were inherently  ephemeral, as was the theatrical performance of domestic life as an  artwork. Bringing together the two concepts of performance and reflec- tion in a cartoon entitled "Music and Aesthetics" (1878), for example,  George Du Maurier probed the stability of constructed identities, the  authentic self, and Ideal beauty (Fig. 1). Dressed aesthetically, the  "lovely and accomplished" Madame Gelasma is shown bending gracefully  over a piano adorned with sunflowers, warbling one of Schumann's  saddest melodies. Yet her distorted reflection in the convex mirror just  over the piano introduces an element of shocking ugliness (as registered  on the faces of some onlookers) into an otherwise exquisite harmony of  music, dress, and furnishings. Where does her "true" self or the authentic  aesthetic experience reside? Walter Pater, novelist, critic, and pioneer of  Aesthetic theory, whose writings Oscar Wilde described as "the holy writ  of beauty," focused on the idea of reality as flux, requiring a fluid form of  artistic expression, and on the interpretation of beauty as rooted in the  individual's sensory perception of the material world.10  Mirrors, long used as an element in interior decoration, featured in  the emerging debates around ideas of subjectivity and psychoanalysis.11  A push-pull fascination with the reflected image as alter ego was fa- mously expressed in Oscar Wilde's novel of 1891, The Picture of Dorian  Gray, and the epigrammatic utterances in the preface: "The nineteenth- century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in  a glass. . . . The nineteenth-century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of  Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass."12 Perhaps more than any  other domestic object-type, they appeared to encapsulate the spectral,  fantastical dimension of interior life, as popularized above all by the  publication of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice  Found There (London, 1872).  As optical devices, mirrors within the home objectified notions of  surveillance, reinforcing the regulation of behavior. For women in par- ticular, the feeling of being visible and observed was internalized, made  part of their self-conception. The experience was not exclusive to  women, however. Henry Treffry Dunn's most abiding impression of  Dante Gabriel Rossetti's home in Chelsea, for example, was of mirrors in  all shapes, sizes, and designs lining the walls, "so that whichever way I  gazed I saw myself looking at myself."13 In this somewhat disorienting,  closed environment, the individual was metaphorically fragmented, mul- </page> <page sequence="4"> Modern Stagings of Domestic Space 67  FBRUARY 16, 1878.] PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 71  FIGURE 1  George Du Maurier, "Music and  Aesthetics," with Madame Gelasma  reflected in a convex mirror.

The mirrors reflected a color here, a sign of  movement there, but as detached fragments with no specific embedded  context or larger coherence. (Similarly in the artist Frederic Leighton's  house, the backs and arms of two "old Arab chairs" to either side of the  drawing room hearth were inset with panels of looking-glass "fit to reflect  back the rows of jewels and broidery that might have adorned the  shoulders of their fair owners.")14 In seeking to capture the hallucinatory  quality of Rossetti's lifestyle and its overwhelming air of neurotic intro- spection, Dunn painted a watercolor of the bedroom as viewed on the  surface of a fashionable convex mirror (Fig. 2). Such bulging mirrors,  emblematic of Aesthetic Movement taste, served as instruments of  reduction, compression, and deformation of visual appearances in a way  that simultaneously addressed and attempted to control the experience of  modernity. Concerns about the impact of the alienating, fragmenting  </page> <page sequence="5"> 68 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  forces of modernity on the mental life of the individual were frequently  focused on the capacity of mirrors to organize, confound, confuse, and  dissolve objects and spaces.  In its transparent form, glass within the interior came to signify both  psychological or aesthetic liberation, but also stultification. The greater  use of plate glass helped open up the domestic interior, reinforcing a  conceptual link between transparency and modernity;15 "art seems about  to be released from her prison within the four walls of the house,"  proclaimed E. W. Godwin in his preface to Artistic Conservatories  (1880).16 Like conservatories, the glass bell-jars, fern cases, and aquaria  that adorned so many bourgeois interiors of the mid- to late nineteenth  century signified a Victorian obsession with the ordering and contain- ment of experience and the natural world, but could also express in  material form the sense of psychological suffocation and neurosis that  Freud identified as linked to the home.17  Aesthetic Reflections and Performance in the Drawing  Room  The representational trope of the watched woman watching herself  before the mirror was elaborated in countless novels, paintings, and  photographs of the late nineteenth century.18 A novel published in 1866,  Mrs. Oliphant's Miss Marjoribanks, presents a pivotal moment with just  such a self-regarding glance, as the author deftly charts her heroine's  coming of age in tandem with the transformation of the family drawing  room.19 "There is a great deal to choosing colours that go well with one's  complexion. People think of that for their dresses, but not for their  rooms, which are of so much more importance . . . I think," said Miss  Majoribanks, rising and looking at herself seriously in the glass, "that I  have enough complexion at present to venture upon a pale spring  green."20 Unexpectedly released from the confines of boarding school  following her mother's death, Lucilla Marjoribanks stands before the  mantel mirror in "this inner court and centre of her kingdom," contem- plating an imagined, empowered self as the future mistress of her father's  household. Later, in the shop of the upholsterer Mr. Holden, she once  again tries on her fantasy self, finding "among his stores a delicious  damask, softly, spiritually green, of which, to his great astonishment, she  tried the effect in one of the great mirrors which ornamented the shop."21  After years of being condemned to thinking about "verbs and chromatic  scales," Lucilla perceives the drawing room as a space of potential  liberation rather than passivity and confinement, as a means to an end of  </page> <page sequence="6"> Modem Stagings of Domestic Space 69  FIGURE 2  Henry Treffry Dunn, Dante Gabriel  Rossetti's Bedroom in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea,  London, c. 1882.

The narratives of many bourgeois domestic dramas like Miss Marjoribanks  unfolded in the drawing room, the place where most novels and maga- zines were also read by women.  </page> <page sequence="7"> 70 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  The processes of looking and being looked at were experienced with  particular intensity in the drawing room, one of the most obviously  theatrical spaces of the home, and one in which many values and  identities were contested.23 People knew they were being observed here,  and that their performances were crucial to social and material success.  Conventionally gendered as a "feminine" space, women within it were in  a sense actors, performing elaborate social rituals as "naturally" as possi- ble, without any signs of registering the analytical gaze of their audience.  It was important to appear "at home" and at one with the room in order  to stress the consistency between one's "true" character and one's pro- jected image. In the literature on household taste, women were con- stantly urged to arrange both themselves and their surroundings as a  FIGURE 3  "What Helen of Troy would appear in a pictorial composition. According to Jakob von Falke, the influential  convex mirror." From Mrs. Eliza Haweis, author and director of the Austrian Decorative Arts Museum, this was  The Art of Decoration (London 1881), 250. "Woman's Aesthetic Mission." "As the mistress of the house she must  Photo: Author. accustom herself to look upon her rooms in all their details as pictures in  which all things are so placed and so combined as to contribute to the  general artistic effect. . . . [N]o one object exists for itself alone, but in  reference to all other objects."24 Interior settings became a frame delim- iting the boundaries of a living artwork, which entailed matching the  female figure, dress, and complexion to the domestic environment. A  critic wrote in 1880: "Is she blond? Then let there be a modicum of pale  blue within her bower . . . rose will detract from a fair skin, pale turquoise  would be preferable, but it will not suit a fresh complexion. . . . We prefer  simple harmony here making the lady the concentration of the  scheme."25  The artifice involved in women presenting themselves as art objects  was made explicit in the drawing-room practice of staging tableaux  vivants.26 In Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, 1905, for example, the  character Lily Bart is temporarily transformed into the subject of Sir  Joshua Reynolds's Mrs. Lloyd in one such performance. This elicits gasps  of appreciation from the audience, and prompts her admirer Selden to  think that "for the first time he seemed to see before him the real  [emphasis added] Lily Bart, divested of the trivialities of her little world,  and catching for a moment a note of that eternal harmony of which her  beauty was a part." The audience is given "magic glimpses" into "the  boundary world between fact and imagination," Wharton writes.27 Yet  the stillness of the performance imposed by the format of the tableau  vivant also had a deathly quality that spoke to the impossibility of  preserving living beauty as part of an eternal harmony; and the tableau  </page> <page sequence="8"> Modern Stagings of Domestic Space 71  remained "in spite of every enhancement of art, only a superior kind of  wax-works."  The infinite number of momentary artworks created within the  illusory space of the mirror encouraged attention to their frames, and to  the fireplace as the "central point of the whole picture" and "natural  focus of the room, towards which every other object should converge."28  In Aesthetic Movement circles there was concern that, like paintings,  mirrors should be framed so as to allow the reflected image at their core  to blend in with the larger conception of the interior. A woman could be  considered intrinsically ornamental by her association with ideas of  beauty, but she required to be handsomely bound or framed by her setting  to become truly beautiful. There was a reaction against colossal mirrors  with "clumsy writhing frames in gold" that dominated many conven- tional drawing-room schemes, and the "unfortunate possessors" of such  objects were advised to cut the large plates of glass into pieces, or to add  an ebonized frame dividing the surface of the glass into compartments,  possibly with a trellis work of shelves and brackets for the display of  books and china.29 Writing in 1881, the interior design expert Mrs.  Haweis praised Whistler and Lawrence Alma-Tadema for their attempts  to simplify the design of "vulgar" frames, but was wary of the "Empire"  style of convex mirrors so favored in "aesthetic" households. There might  be "something dainty and amusing in seeing the liliputian world all alive  and changing, moving across the surface," but when allowed to come  into contact with the female form such mirrors could "make our faces  seem bloated with toothache or hollow with atrophy—our figures spent  and wasted, as with sore disease." Even Helen of Troy would look a fright  (Fig. 3).  Through a chain of associative thinking, mirrors were drawn into  the negative discourse around women, consumerism, and fashion. The  reflective surfaces of the drawing room were vilified constantly in the  literature on household taste as vulgar, ostentatious, and deceptive, and  in terms that communicated an underlying anxiety about a collapse of  distinctions between counterfeit and genuine, person and thing. The  Aesthetic female's relationship to commodity culture and the fashion- able drawing room is literally and symbolically refracted through a mirror  in George Du Maurier's 1873 cartoons, "The Contrast," addressed to a  knowing audience in Punch magazine (Fig. 4). The lure of the art object,  in this case one of those old-fashioned convex mirrors much admired in  the Aesthetic interior, has drawn a well-dressed woman to the salerooms,  where she sits gazing placidly at her reflection. Like the figure in Whis- tler's Symphony in White No. 2: The Little White Girl (1864), she appears  </page> <page sequence="9"> 72 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  motionless, inscrutable, and at ease with the ephemeral artwork she has  composed on the mirror's surface, a reflected image that remains hidden  from our view. The category of the Aesthetic that she represents,  however, is contaminated by association with the venality of the auction  room, "a reeking old place," and by the stereotyping of the bidders that  surround her as Semitic "descendants of Shem." Her self-absorbed gaze  renders her oblivious to both the distorted nature of her own reflection  and the leering ugliness of her admirers, and she remains apparently  locked in the regressive emotional state of narcissism that prevents  self-knowledge. For a present-day viewer the image calls into question  her ability to discriminate aesthetically between objects of beauty, herself  included, and ultimately implies that she has become interchangeable  with her abject self in failing to register the mismatch with her surround- ings. In the reflected image we cannot see, the convex mirror gathers and  abstracts the woman and contingent figures around her onto a single  surface bounded within a perfect circle, enclosing them all within a  transcendent idea that dissolves acceptable boundaries between pure  beauty and its abject "other."  Three weeks later Du Maurier presents us with a mirror image of the  same saleroom where we are told "a great change has taken place for the  better. Auction Rooms, where mirrors are sold, are now exclusively  haunted by fair Ladies (led there possibly by some vague hope of meeting  Mr. Punch, and being immortalised by his discreet and not unflattering  pencil)." The attraction of the commodity has been compounded by  women's susceptibility to the flattery and publicity in their apparently  obsessive desire to see their appearance reflected and replicated not only  in the public context of saleroom mirrors, but on the printed page. As  mindless followers of fashion, the females in the cartoon are seen to  circulate, like the commodities they resemble, in auction houses and  magazines, achieving self-definition through the visual enactment of a  kind of "gossip." The multiplication of the women since the first cartoon,  implying a repeated permutation of the act of looking, draws attention to  the voyeurism involved. At the same time another major change has  taken place, in the shift of the Semitic audience from the periphery to  the core of this visual encounter with the mirror. This inversion effects  a philosophical reversal like the frequent slurring between subject and  FIGURE 4 (facing page) object in the epigrammatic utterances beloved of Aesthetes.

Auction Rooms, where mirrors are sold, are now exclusively haunted by fair Ladies (led there possibly by some vague hope of meeting  Mr, Punch, and being immortalised by his discreet and not unflattering pencil).  On the other hand, those less ornamental beings, who have hitherto been the principal frequenters of such places, have altogether vanished  from the scene—with the exception, however, of one, whose manners, obliging, yet unobtrusive, and polite, without obsequiousness, lead one  to the conviction that he cannot be what he seems, and that his apparent calling and unmistakeably Semitic aspect are part and parcel of some  cunningly assumed disguise.  </page> <page sequence="11"> 74 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  eration, linking the image of the dissembling woman with that of the  dissembling Jew, thereby exposing the beguiling object's debased nature.  There is more at stake here than women's vanity. Fashionable women  have become the medium through which the corrupting presence of an  ethnic outsider has been imported to the center of artistic and national  culture. The caption implies that the women are taken in by his manners  ("obliging yet unobtrusive, and polite, without obsequiousness") which  convince them "he cannot be what he seems." Lurking beneath the  suggestion that his appearance is "part and parcel of some cunningly  assumed disguise" is an anxiety that assimilated Jews might remain  undetected, and its corollary—that women's love of commodities is  incrementally, and adversely, affecting society and culture more gener- ally.  Women were criticized for "dressing up" their interiors to be attrac- tive, a form of masquerade through which they dissembled a calculating  self-interest. Another cartoon by George Du Maurier, "Aesthetic with a  Vengeance" (1873), presents feminine beauty as an artistic commodity  seen by certain men as interchangeable with the furnishings of the  drawing room. It depicts a bachelor who owns a "stunning house" eying  two sisters as potential marriage material at a drawing-room soiree (Fig.  5). On the basis of looks he plumps for the short one on the grounds that  she "seems to harmonise better with the kind of furniture I go in  for—Buhl and Marqueterie, don't you know."30 A similar innuendo about  objectification and sexual possession was evident in a courtroom ex- change involving Augustus Howell, a collector and art dealer for Whis- tler and Rossetti:  Witness [Howell]: I produce a photograph of a room I fitted up, in  which everything is a work of art.  Mr. Bidder: Is the lady represented in the photograph a work of art?  (Laughter.)  Witness: The lady is the owner of the house and the gem of the  collection. (Applause and laughter.)  Mr. Bidder: She is not an old English lady. That is, I suppose, the  only old English thing you draw your line at. (Laughter.)  Witness: Certainly, on the most modest grounds, I prefer the young  ones, merely for the sake of contrast. (Great laughter.)31  Dating from around the same time as Miss Majoribanks, Whistler's Sym- phony in White No. 2: The Little White Girl (1864) also communicates a  sense of the seamless extension of the poised female subject-object into  her immediate surroundings, and the circuitous containment of the  </page> <page sequence="12"> Modem Stagings of Domestic Space 75  98 PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

The mantel mirror before which the  woman stands, and by extension the interior, becomes a space of con- templation and suspended animation, reconfiguring her form within the  idealized environment of Whistler's drawing room in Lindsey Row, and  dissolving her individuated self in an image that the title likens to the  musical performance of a "symphony."32 His female model is not an  active, individuated subject like Lucilla Marjoribanks, however, but an  objectified and passive cipher for the sphere of poetic and spiritual values.  Paradoxically the painting, in itself a fixed, unchanging object,  functions to fix an ephemeral, arrested moment so that it can be ob- served. In painting the model's reflected image Whistler captures and  freezes a momentary experience that would otherwise exist only as a  memory or fantasy, an element of the interior that could be seen but not  touched, and which emphasized the instability of the whole interior as a  coherent entity. The woman's psychological interior and her physical  self, as well as the reflected and actual spaces of the interior, are merged  on the same flattened and autonomous plane of the canvas. Firmly stuck  in the drawing room, she is subject to the visual control and aesthetic  judgment of both artist and onlooker. Like the interior and the painting  itself, she can be read as a composite held together by artifice, and  redolent of the artist's Aesthetic sensibility.

The painting and its reflected image, however, also became an  oneiric medium for the displaced fantasies and recollections of the  spectator, then and now; and the voyeuristic appeal of this private  introverted moment is heightened by its exposure to a steady stream of  strangers in the public, impersonal space of the art gallery.  From Bell Jar to Dunghill: Walter Sickert's Interiors  Like most Anglo-American artists of his generation, Whistler did  not attempt to penetrate the poise of the beautiful women he depicted in  drawing rooms, but a painting by his young acolyte Walter Sickert  </page> <page sequence="15"> 78 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  provides a glimpse quite literally "behind the scenes." In The Acting  Manager of 1885-1886 (originally exhibited under the title Rehearsal—the  End of the Act), Miss Helen Couper-Black, general manager of the  London d'Oyly Carte Theatre Company, is shown slumped on a sofa,  cradling her head in one arm.33 She had pursued an acting career before  joining the company, and the "Act" is possibly Whistler's notorious "Ten  o'Clock Lecture," of which she organized several presentations in 1885,  but it is also the end of her own "Act." Exhausted by the performance of  managing this event, she apparently can no longer face her reflection in  the small round mirror that looms behind the couch.34 Its erect outline  and anthropomorphic shape seem to stand for her composed self, an echo  of the performance just past.  As a professional actor and flamboyant character himself, Sickert  understood the nature of theatrical performance. In particular he reveled  in the transparently artificial, jingoistic, and popular art form of the  music hall, which had no pretensions to being "high art." The painting  he exhibited at the New English Art Club in 1888, Gatti's Hungerford  Palace of Varieties, caused a storm of controversy. The Artist said that it  embodied "the aggressive squalor which pervades to a greater or lesser  extent the whole of modern existence."35 By means of a title, Tipperary  (referring to a popular music-hall song), Sickert later transferred a hint  of this "squalor" into the domestic environment with an image of his  gawky, toothy model (one Emily Powell, known as "Chicken") rattling  out the rousing tune on a grand piano (Fig. 7).36 The raucous sounds of  this domestic concert served to rupture the "naturalized" performances  associated both with the classic theater and with the bourgeois home,  critiquing images of music-making in the drawing room that extended  back to Whistler's At the Piano (begun 1858, exhibited Royal Academy  1860) and ultimately to Dutch seventeenth-century genre painting.  By 1908, Sickert had become openly critical of Whistler, penning  the first of several damning articles.  Suppose we get the loveliest woman procurable and put her in the  finest robe imaginable! Suppose we even design the dress! . . . Let us  surround her with the most precious china! Let there be sprays of  azaleas, and so on! Perhaps we shall thus create a very Paradise of  art! Who knows? Ought not the product to be a very syrup of the  purest taste?37  Not as far as Sickert was concerned; "the lilies and langours of the  Chelsea amateurs" had sent Whistler into the cul-de-sac of the drawing  </page> <page sequence="16"> Modern Stagings of Domestic Space 79  FIGURE 8  Walter Sickert, The New Home, 1908.

"Taste" was the death of a painter; it got in  the way of observing and recording "ready-made life." His own painting  of 1908, The New Home, adopted the domestic subject matter that then  dominated British art, but, rather than featuring a bourgeois drawing  room, it depicted a working-class woman seated by the fireplace of her  "sordid" lodgings in Camden Town (Fig. 8).38 Here the old-fashioned  bell jar, white fire surround, and dingy wallpaper stood in deliberate  contrast to the props making up Whistler's "syrup of taste." There is an  apparent disjuncture between the woman's dress and environment and  her state of mind.

Sickert continued his critique of Whistler in 1910, suggesting that Sickert / DACS 2008.  the first stage in reorienting English art was to show the drawing room for  what it was, and to caricature the unspoken cultural values and out- moded social and aesthetic conventions for which it stood.  The more our art is serious the more it will tend to avoid the  drawing room.. . . The plastic arts are gross arts, dealing joyously  with gross material facts. They call in their servants for a robust  stomach and a great power of endurance, and while they will  flourish in the scullery, or on the dunghill, they fade at a breath in  the drawing room.40  Sickert's "gross arts" make reference to touch ("plastic"), taste ("robust  stomach"), and smell ("dunghill"), as compared to the scent of azaleas,  and the refined tactility of china and textiles in Whistler's art. This  contrasted register of sensory detail is carried through into Sickert's  depictions of domestic space in the years that followed. The dung- colored dinginess of his Camden Town interiors resists cooptation into  Whistler's hyper-refined aesthetic. Their aura of grime and sweat, sexual  desire and mortality, marks the return of the repressed—all those ele- ments that Whistler's Aestheticism had sought to suppress and subli- mate. Although the image of the dunghill alluded to decay and putre- faction, however, it also held within it the promise of fertilized, organic  growth, and of a more vital connection between life and art than the  Aesthetes could offer.  Sickert's most famous picture, Ennui (c. 1914), was elaborated from  preparatory drawings into five versions, the largest of which was exhib- ited at the 1914 New English Art Club (Fig. 9). It brings the viewer  closer to a messy, lived sense of domestic experience than does Whistler's  Symphony in White No. 2, despite the ambiguity of the apparent "realism"  and the equally staged nature of the scene. The setting was a room in  Granby Street in London's Camden Town, which Sickert had used as a  studio from around 1908. Unlike Whistler, he kept his home and work  life separate. "There is a constant snare in painting what is part of your  life," he warned two of his pupils.41 The alcoholic "Hubby" and Marie  Hayes, who had joined his unconventional household, served as models.  The implicit sociability of the bourgeois drawing room is critiqued in the  dislocated positioning of the two figures, each locked into a private  </page> <page sequence="19"> 82 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  reverie, their body language expressing alienation and psychological  discomfort. The bored stance of the woman leaning on the chest of  drawers and the man's gaze into the middle distance through a haze of  smoke and alcohol are suggestive of claustrophobia and enervation.  As in The New Home, the woman in Ennui seems to distance herself  mentally from her environment, rather than to merge her identity with  that of the living room. The focus of her contemplation, the bell jar, can  be viewed as representing her self-contained domestic world in micro- cosm, but psychologically she stands apart from it, observing its contents  from the outside. In the way she relates to the bell jar, she mimics, and  thereby draws attention to, the voyeuristic gaze of the onlooker peering  into her domestic space. Similarly, in a related drawing of the same  period, Sickert sets a young woman simultaneously inside and outside of  the scene depicted by means of a title, My Awful Dad (1912), directing  the onlooker to view the scene through the daughter's eyes.42 The  oscillation between viewer-subject-object becomes part of a continuous  interaction that turns the dynamics of viewing back on itself.  The most significant domestic object in Ennui is the glass bell jar on  the chest of drawers (which had already appeared on the mantelpiece in  The New Home, 1908; Fig. 8). Old-fashioned and containing dried  flowers and stuffed birds, it is a symbol of petrified life in which time and  space are compressed. It represents a miniaturized world—a mnemonic  universe—within the already self-contained environment of the interior,  its contents guarded from external intrusion by the glass, to be looked at  but not touched, like a young woman on display to potential suitors. The  implied journey of the woman's imagination does not take the viewer to  far-off cultures and places, however, but into this tiny mortuary of  organic life. The glass dome represents an attempt to collect organic and  authentic experience of the "natural world" within the confines of the  domestic interior, but paradoxically its contents—no longer connected  to anything vital—have become emblems of boredom and death. Like  the mantel mirror in Symphony in White No. 2, the bell jar acts as a  framing device or container for lived experience that can exist only at  the level of memory or fantasy.  Its contents signify lost time, unrepeatable experience, as does the  ephemeral reflection in Whistler's painting. For Sickert the stillness and  beauty of Whistler's female model were like that of a museum specimen  that had "faded at a breath" in the confines of the drawing room; she  functions as a paradigm of beauty but also of atrophy, the manifestation  of a quasi-taxidermic quest to resist extinction and preserve identity from  change and movement. Just as the domed glass encases its specimens, so  </page> <page sequence="20"> Modern Stagings of Domestic Space 83  Whistler's drawing room had entrapped the woman as a decorative  object to be ogled and visually possessed, as if in a fish bowl. In the light  of Sickert's ongoing critique of the bourgeois drawing room, there is a  provocative correlation to be drawn between the contents of the bell jar  in The New Home and Ennui and the experience of the domestic interior  as presented by Whistler. Life outside the bell jar in Sickert's studio  might confront viewers with signs of their mortality and decay, but at  least that life would be vital  Performance and Reflection in Motion: The Mackintoshes'  Glasgow Home  While Sickert was engaging with modernity through the "vulgar  degradation" of domestic life in Camden Town, in Scotland Charles  Rennie Mackintosh and his wife, Margaret Macdonald, were enacting a  very different form of domestic theater, one that pushed Aesthetic  idealism to its limit in the process of creating a three-dimensional,  walk-through work of art consistent with their artistic personae. The  setting was 6 Florentine Terrace (later renamed 78 Southpark Avenue)  in Glasgow, where the couple lived from 1906 to 1914. Working within  the preexisting architectural shell of a property that once stood at the  end of a terrace, they transformed the interiors, melding elements from  their former flat as well as earlier exhibition installations, tearoom  interiors, and private commissions, into a fresh spatial montage that  exaggerated the prevalent visual and material coding of the bourgeois  home.43 In these dreamlike interiors, all references to nature, history, and  everyday experience were processed through the artistic temperament.  Immersed as they were in the intellectual currents of Aestheticism,  Symbolism, and Theosophy, the Mackintoshes saw daily existence as a  critical act requiring transcendental intensity, and the test of their  domestic artwork was its completeness, the perfect unity of impression it  conveyed.44 The tenor of the spiritual milieu in which they lived and  worked is captured in the poetic language of Mackintosh's 1902 lecture  on "Seemliness," and in the rhapsodic account by their friend Major  Desmond Chapman-Huston of his visit to their home around 1910: "The  beginning and end of Art is to engender beauty, and devotion to beauty;  To make dreamers and stimulate our life of dream . . . I was thralled in  a mist of strange mysterious beauty; real, absolute, abstract, naked  beauty."45  In this case the drama was provided by a cumulative experience of  moving through the house rather than representing domestic theater  </page> <page sequence="21"> 84 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  contained within one room, as in the paintings of Whistler and Sickert.  Such a promenading gaze was also evident in pageants, a theatrical genre  popular with Mackintosh, Macdonald, and their Glasgow contemporar- ies, which moved between different sites, releasing performers and audi- ence alike from fixed viewpoints within the confines of a conventional  theater.46 At home they created a circuitous journey of the imagination,  aestheticizing the daily round of activities in a series of visual and tactile  experiences representing different facets of a metaphorical and spiritual  transformation. Theosophical thought aspired to the unity of spiritual  and material existence and the integration of gendered opposite to form  a unity of impression. The inhabitants circulated within this spatial  enclosure, between the dark nether regions of the "masculine" interiors  (the ground-floor hall and dining room) and the heightened spirituality  and lightness of the "feminine" rooms above (the studio-drawing room  and bedroom).47 In his lecture "Seemliness," in 1902, Mackintosh de- scribed "true art" as being "like an escape into the mountain air from the  stagnant vapours of a morass."48 There was a sense of the steady casting  off of vulgar sensation and the debris of the phenomenological world,  starting with the symbolic divesting of outer garments before a mirror in  the transitional space of the hallway, and ascending to the unclothed  intimacy and diffused eroticism of the white bedroom above (Fig. 10).49  Positioned at the top of the house, the space of the bedroom metaphor- ically and psychologically approached the realm of undifferentiated con- sciousness, representing a space for dreams, sleep, sex, and death. The  attenuated forms of the furniture, the impractical, increasingly ethereal  colors, and imagery of emaciated human forms all emphasized the pro- jection of spiritual values rather than material needs, eliciting behavior  full of body consciousness. "Whiteness" and "lightness" become expres- sive of a return to origins, and to a condition of pure potential, but at the  same time an Aesthetic strategy for keeping at bay the kind of unpalat- able realities and extraneous "matter" featured in Sickert's art. Viewed in  relation to the anthropologist Mary Douglas's classic definition of dirt as  "matter out of place," the Mackintoshes' interiors made a statement  about "matter" being controlled effectively, and threatened social and  psychological boundaries being redrawn.50 The specters of waste, disease,  sex, and death posed a threat to this elaborate projection of image, this  fragile sense of self within the home, particularly in the bedroom, which  was a setting for dreams and erotic pleasure yet also often a sickroom and  always adjacent to the site of daily ablutions, and therefore vulnerable to  "unpleasant associations of ideas" and signs of mortality.51  </page> <page sequence="22"> Modern Stagings of Domestic Space 85  Like the drawing room, the bedroom was connected inextricably  with the construction and performance of feminine identity: "the bed- room belongs essentially to the woman and it might almost be said that  the man enters it as her guest, as we have seen him doing in the drawing  room," wrote Hermann Muthesius in 1904.52 (Muthesius included pho- tographs of the Mackintoshes' previous flat in Glasgow in this study of  British interiors and domestic life, and he and his wife Anna were friends  of the Mackintoshes.) Only the wife had the prerogative of dressing  there, Muthesius continued, with the husband tending to use the bath- room in the absence of a separate dressing room. Apart from the bed, a  dressing table and/or mirror was considered essential, even in a maid's  room. The dressing mirror was used primarily for dressing the hair, an  aspect of her appearance to which Margaret Macdonald was certainly  attentive. Echoing earlier allusions by artists like Whistler to women as  living artworks, Chapman-Huston described her looks and her mass of  coppery burnished hair as like those in a Rossetti or Burne-Jones paint- ing, "except that she is an original; she has no poses, and does not seek  to copy anyone."53 Since Charles Eastlake's Hints on Household Taste  (1868), the dressing table had been consistently vilified as the reification  of feminine vanity, and an accessory to the concealment of the authentic  self. There was a persistent fear on the part of many design reformers that  decaying, corrupted beauty might lurk beneath a cosmetic surface. As in  the drawing room, feminine subjectivity was presented as an extension of  the toilette. Writing in 1902, H. J. Jennings likened a showy drawing  room to a rouged woman "dressed to kill." By the same token he viewed  the dressing table as being decked out in a white "frock of falsehood"; it  was "a fraud . . . unless you prefer the term 'whited sepulchre.' "54 There  was no allusion to feminine "frock" or shroud in the Mackintoshes'  dressing mirror, however, but, more shockingly, a sublimated reference to  the naked and eroticized female form in the sloping form and "pelvic  girdle" of the frame (Fig. 10).55 The new visual iconography developed in FIGURE 10  the 1890s by The Four (the Macdonald sisters, Mackintosh, and Herbert Charles Rennie Mackintosh, dressing  McNair) had been described by outraged critics as "ghoulish," and the mirror, designed 1900 for 120 Mains  emaciated human figures as "drawn on the gas pipe system."56 The Street, photographed in bedroom of  reconstructed Mackintosh House, Glasgow  structural reciprocity between frame and image, container and con- (opened 1980).

The use of the term "Psyche" to  </page> <page sequence="23"> 86 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  describe such mirrors points to their symbolic role in representing the  alter ego, and in psychoanalytic terms the frame is experienced as shoring  up the collapsing structure of corporeality.57  Traditionally such dressing mirrors were placed at the window so as  to take advantage of the incoming light, and in The English House  (1904), Muthesius even suggested incorporating the mirror in the win- dow plane (p. 229). Contemporary photographs of bedrooms designed by  Mackintosh for 120 Mains Street, Glasgow (1900), Windyhill, Kilmal- colm (1901), and The Hill House, Helensburgh (1903), all show full- length white mirrors occupying such a position (Fig. 11). Rather than  providing an opening onto external nature, however, these mirrors  project a landscape from the inside, turning the spatial flow backwards  into the interior. Like Tennyson's heroine in The Lady of Shalott (1832,  revised 1842), the viewer standing before the mirror cannot transcend  his or her reflection and commune directly with the outer world. A  boundary is signified, but ambiguously so, as was evident in the Mack- intoshes' installation of the same mirror at the Vienna Secession exhi- bition in 1900, where it stood flat against the wall, creating an illusion of  opening into the adjacent space (Fig. 12).58 The reflection marks both a  beginning and ending, metaphorically articulating the Theosophical  conviction that life is lived backwards after death. In this pattern of  moving through the house, time revolves rather than progresses, echoing  the eddying rhythms of the spatial enclosure.59  A dressing mirror plays a similarly pivotal and symbolic role in the  novel Open the Door! (1920) by Catherine Carswell (1879-1946). The  narrative describes the psycho-sexual journey of a young single woman,  Joanna, through an identifiably "artistic" Glasgow home.60 The act of  crossing the threshold and entering the Aestheticized interiors produces  a visceral response with physiological symptoms, and a heightened  awareness of her bodily as well as psychological state.  Even to herself Joanna did not admit how nervous she became in  the Lovatts' house. But from the moment the front door closed  between her and the street, there was always a tightening of all her  nerves. As she passed through the square entrance hall, so unlike  any other known to her . . . her very muscles would stiffen a little  with the involuntary effort which these decorations seemed to  demand.61  The sense of her transition toward an altered state of being is com- pounded by "the bizarre concealment of her ball-gown" beneath the coat  in which she has just attended a Presbyterian prayer meeting.

As conventions of the period dictated, she is shown to the  upstairs bedroom that often served as a ladies' cloakroom on occasions  such as "at homes" or evening dinner parties and musical entertain- ments.62 Here her passage through the house climaxes in an autoerotic  encounter with her reflection in the full-length mirror. "As she shook out  the voluminous skirt before Mildred's cheval glass she seemed to herself  as light as gossamer. She palpitated in response to the brightness in her  own eyes, to the wild colour in her cheeks." In an aroused, near hallu- cinatory state she floats back down the blue-carpeted stair toward the  drawing room, feeling "as if the vessel of her being were full to the lip  with incandescent flame." The description resonates with Walter Pater's  image of pure aesthetic experience burning with a "hard, gemlike flame"  that no longer differentiates between inner and outer, suggesting a fusion  of the psycho-sexual and the aesthetic. Once inside the drawing room  below, where she dimly registers the overall disposition of figures through  her wide-angle vision, she becomes conscious of a stranger pointedly  "staring at her through the strong lenses of his glasses with the painter's  intentness." Her image is "captured" once more, this time against the  backdrop of the drawing room, as if viewed through a photographic lens  or mirror, and framed by a painterly gaze.63  When Desmond Chapman-Huston first visited the Mackintoshes in  1910, the house was still part of a group on a terrace, and on climbing the  </page> <page sequence="25"> 88 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Fall-Winter 2008-2009  FIGURE 12  Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret  Macdonald, installation at Eighth  Exhibition of Vienna Secession, 1900.

Nowadays, however, no one can cross that threshold, as the front  door remains without exterior stairs, marooned in mid-air, in the 1980  reconstruction at the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Art Gallery.  The oblique entry of the modern visitor entering the house via the Art  Gallery shop not only undercuts the drama of the Mackintoshes' original  layout, but also underscores the disjunctive relationship between the  Brutalist architectural style of the gallery's exterior and the hushed,  air-conditioned intimacy of the Mackintosh interiors. Although visitors  have the chance to immerse themselves in the spaces, it is of course  impossible to recreate the process of dwelling there, or leave traces of  temporary occupation. Their behavior regulated by camera surveillance  and the gaze of uniformed security staff, visitors and furnishings become  </page> <page sequence="26"> Modern Stagings of Domestic Space 89  part of a new spectacle. In effect the Mackintosh House becomes another  form of illusory commodity, a spectral representation venerated by an  audience that is itself on display.  In each of the works discussed in this article, the theatrical perfor- mance of domestic life as an artwork resists completion or repetition. The  metaphorical allusions to the "staging" or "reflection" of experience  within the home serve to highlight the inherently unstable and ephem- eral nature of lived experience, whether that is reflected within Whis- tler's mirror frame, distorted within Du Maurier's cartoons, distilled  within Sickert's bell jar, or enacted in the spaces of the Mackintoshes'  house. The identities constructed in each case bring the spectator, then  and now, into ambiguous and constantly changing dialogues with both  the artists and the subjects depicted.
