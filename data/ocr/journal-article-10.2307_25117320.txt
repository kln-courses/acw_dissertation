<plain_text><page sequence="1">m&amp;?:m?Xsm;^mm:,ru BOOKS Thomas H. Thompson /Peter Cooley/Robert Phillips A Mock Encounter Beyond Freedom and Dignity, by B. F. Skinner. Knopf. $6.95 e reviewer of Beyond Freedom and Dignity has to face up to an embarrassing problem before he writes a single word. The question before him is: How is he going to take this book?as a serious scientific treatise or as a piece of semi-serious Utopian science fiction? Since B. F. Skinner comes before the reader trailing clouds of psychological glory based on his apparently sound, even preeminent stand ing among his psychological peers, the reviewer is tempted to call upon his psychological expertise and try to do a responsible job on Beyond Freedom and Dignity. I started to write in that vein, but I quit. What gave out was not my psychological knowledge?granted it is a couple of decades out of date?but rather my belief that Skinner actually had written the kind of book that would repay an innocently serious attempt to consider his arguments and his evidence and to derive some careful, prudent judgments about them. This may have been a wrong-headed decision. Skinner may be right in castigating his humanist critics for ignorance of the latest wrinkles of behaviorist psychology or for failing to realize in their eagerness to defend freedom against tyranny that there are some systems of total control that never generate what he calls "aversive consequences." I may belong in one or both of those unflattering categories. The reader who disagrees with my hard-won sense that this is not a wholly serious book should switch to another reviewer. I suggest Noam Chomsky. That already turned off reader may choose either the justly famous review of Skinner s more genuinely technical treatise, Verbal Be havior (reviewed in 1959), or Chomsky's recent review of Beyond Freedom and Dignity in the 30 December 1971 New York Review of Books. In either case, he will read essentially the same review, even though the reviews are about different books. Chomsky takes Skinner to task with a meticulous accuracy that stands in revealing contrast to Skinner's bluff arrogance. I think he shows that Skinner's approach, either to verbal behavior or to freedom and dignity, suffers from an eccentric notion of what the scientific method is and how one goes about performing an analysis of certain complex types of behavior. The path I have chosen is to treat Beyond Freedom and Dignity as a book written for the psychological lay reader but which, for Skinner, at least, is a thoroughly serious ef fort. I do maintain that there are some perhaps uninten tionally hilarious emphases and conclusions in the book. But that Skinner is serious in wanting to root out certain mistaken habits of thought now regrettably current among men of letters can hardly be doubted. Th Yet another equally apt way of characterizing Beyond Freedom and Dignity is simply to say, to those who have read Skinner's previous best-seller, Waiden II, that this latest book is a mildly technical commentary on the basic philosophical underpinning of the Waiden II Utopian community. The arguments between Frazier, Burris, and Castle, which were narrative modes of describing a concrete utopia are in Beyond Freedom and Dignity shorn of their literary trimmings and set forth abstractly for their own sake. Beyond Freedom and Dignity stands to Waiden II as Plato's Republic would have stood to a tale about Syracuse under Dionysus (if Plato could have whipped that young rascal into shape) or as the story of the Crot?n community under Pythagoras would have stood to a Pythagorean utopia, had he written one. If I am right in these perceptions, Beyond Freedom and Dignity really should have come first and Waiden II afterward. For Beyond Freedom and Dignity develops the theoretical framework and argues, like the first book of More s Utopia, that contemporary society is warped and corrupt because of basic conceptual misunderstandings and distortions. It would then seem logical that Waiden II should follow along after Beyond Freedom and Dignity to provide us with a concrete literary realization of the new and improved world system available if only the theoretical model were translated into visualized life forms. I am not sure why Skinner has chosen to provide us first with a utopia and then, more than two decades later, with a rationale for the same utopia. But I would not be much surprised if his purpose were inspired by recent revelations that the tendencies of present global civilization, extrapolated only a couple of decades into the future, are pushing that civilization straight towards the millennium. The first chapter of Beyond Freedom and Dignity invokes the familiar images of modern millennialists?the ninety-degree takeoff of the world population curve, the probable prospect of nuclear annihilation, the depletion of irreplaceable resources, and the pollution of the ecosphere by the progress of modern industry. And so he points out very early that What we need is a technology of behavior. We could solve our problems quickly enough if we could adjust the growth of the world's population as precisely as we adjust the course of a space ship or improve agriculture and industry with some of the confidence with which we accelerate high energy particles, or move toward a peaceful world with something like the steady progress with which physics has approached absolute zero. . . but a behavioral technology comparable in power and precision 70 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 197Z</page><page sequence="2">to physical and biological technology is lacking, and those who do not find the very possibility ridiculous are more likely to be frightened by it than reassured. That is how far we are from under standing human issues in the sense in which physics and biology understand their fields, and how far we are from preventing the catastrophe toward which the world seems to be inexorably moving [emphasis mine], (p. 5) The thrust of this and similar emphases in Skinner's book is clear enough and hardly original with Skinner. The evidence marshalled in sermons from the prophets of doom seems to be incontrovertible; we are all but surfeited with jeremiads. The prophets of doom are in considerable danger of having so prodigally expended whatever shock value they may have had at first that nobody is even listening much anymore. But Skinner has been alerted. It must have been the sense of impending tragedy for the race that carried him back to the subject of Waiden II twenty-three years later. I suspect that much of the dogmatic and declarative quality of Skinner's prose that so annoys Chomsky and which, judging from the sale of this book, must perversely attract many of his less sophisticated readers, derives from the sense of urgency that he feels in the year 1972. The quoted passage also reveals something of the tone of avuncular exasperation at the great humanistic unwashed who, however noble their intentions, are mindlessly cooperating in the "inexorable catastrophe" toward which Skinner sees the whole world heading. Preserve "freedom" and "dignity" as these noble savages adrift in a technological world insist upon it, and there will be no "beyond." Those liberal humanists whose structure of values is rooted in a vanished past are cooperat ing in the destructive character of physical technology which has given to the population explosion, pollution, the bomb, and resource depletion their terrifying capacity to exterminate the human species in just a few decades. So unless we cynically suppose that Skinner is merely massag ing his own ego by producing a shocking best-seller, or is greedy to preserve that juicy grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, it seems to me that he is taking up the stance of psychological missionary to educated heathen suffering from scientific cultural lag. He must think that only a person of his prestige has a chance of bringing home an understanding of the problem and what he takes to be the available solution. That solution, since it derives from the laboratory, will never be deduced without help by the literary and political types who will not read psychology and if they did would fail to draw the startling conclusions for humanity implicit in bar-presses by rats and peckings by pigeons. At any rate, building upon these assumptions, and before essaying any attempt to relate what I see in Beyond Freedom and Dignity any more closely to the actual text, I wish to try out my own pr?cis of the book's message on those cultured barbarians to whom Skinner is trying to bring the good news of behavioral technology. It goes something like this. The sciences of physics and biology began to clear up the vagueness and the mystery in which the behavior of everyday objects and creatures was enveloped when Plato and Aristotle dominated the pre scientific scene only when they rid themselves of the notion of purpose and restricted themselves to causes. Never mind that you may suppose that an explanation of sorts may be given for behavior in terms of needs and wants as well as in terms of "mechanical" pushes and shoves. Even the cultured barbarians have come around to the acceptance of straightforward causal explanation in the case of the neutral objects treated by physicists. More reluctantly, the pre scientific polloi have admitted and accepted the imminent reduction of organic life to physical and chemical processes treated by biologists and biochemists. But what about the behavior of human "objects"? Can they be analyzed in like fashion, their behavior predicted and manipulated, and their groups and their interrelations controlled as readily and as legitimately as a swarm of electrons and protons? Skinner's rough-and-ready answer is a rapid affirmative, and he is supremely confident that the very nature of science itself guarantees the reduction of the human "object" in precisely the same mode that the sciences of matter and life have pioneered. He sets up the opposition to his own scientistic certainties in the form of "defenders of freedom and dignity" who, in their petulant and reactionary opposition, dim the last and the only hope for mankind's survival. This seems to be the justification for Skinner acting as promoter in Beyond Freedom and Dignity for a heavy handed boxing match. In the one corner we have Science? a brawny young heavyweight on whose side is the smart money of the sports-minded minority. In the other corner we have an old fighter, Freedom, a bit wrinkled and leaden footed, veteran of a good many bouts, and once upon a time a fairly heavy swinger. Skinner clangs the bell and brings both fighters out, but only Science gets in any killing punches?not all of them above the belt. In a bout like this there can be little doubt about the identity of the winner. Apparently the promoter thinks the "autonomous man" should have had the sense to retire from the ring before putting on this pitiful exhibition. For, to change the metaphor, the contest between science and the autonomous man as Skinner masterminds it is like a set-to between one of Socrates' interlocutors and Socrates himself in one of Plato 's dialogues. Plato sees to it that the winner is already firmly decided before the dialectical horseplay begins. But I stray from my pr?cis, and given the weightiness of the matter I suppose I should be a little more serious about it. Even if the battle in Beyond Freedom and Dignity is what I claim, a mock encounter between a morality-play Science and a Moli?re-ish Traditional Freedom, why does Skinner bother to put the contestants to each others throats, and furthermore, how does the picture of Science mauling Traditional Freedom help to save us all from the approaching world disaster? I think we need to approach the answer roundabout rather than directly. Borrowing a page from William James, the question at issue can be put as follows: Is there a soul in man, and, even if there is, does it make any dif ference? James asked somewhere whether a "mechanical sweetheart," who behaved in every way like a real sweet heart, would ever betray her one blemish?namely that she had no soul? Skinner's answer is that one could never tell the difference and that the question itself is rather asinine, THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 197Z 71</page><page sequence="3">betraying as it does an old-fashioned view of the person. The answer Skinner attributes to the defenders of freedom and dignity is, Yes?glory be?soul makes the difference practically all the difference?between a real, human sweet heart and the most convincing automaton. Now the con notations of "soul" in the example are a little, though not altogether, misleading. The expression "soul" cannot be employed without implying the philosophical and religious meanings with which it is encrusted and which carry considerations of immortality, God, and spiritual values. Well, Skinner does believe that the reverberations of such an expression as "soul" are still confusing the outlook of the modern defenders of freedom and dignity, even though the notion of soul has been fairly thoroughly secularized. The real source of confusion comes from the liberal tradition of natural rights and natural law which identifies the human being?in contrast to the dead things of his non human environment?as a bearer of rights revealed by reason (and certified upstairs by the Deity). The defender of freedom and dignity primly restricts science and technology to the realm of physical things and insists upon preserving an enclave specifically "human" wherein the old dispensa tion still lingers. To put it as carelessly as Skinner actually does, one could say that the other side holds that man can mold and remold his environment by the use of the faculty of will which is a force innate to his mind and that where there is injustice, given the right attitude, free men may root it out and triumph over a hostile environment. But given this gross assumption, Skinner would say, the illusion is created that, regardless of the pushes and pulls of the environment and regardless of the Old Adam in the form of genetic inheritance, the free will of man can now and then supervene over the physical world and print his own mark upon it. Man is not a slave, says Freedom, he is an architect, a mover and a shaker. Matter, Freedom admits, makes for a tough road, but, with the help of Reason and an attitude of inner courage, man's will can triumph over outer adversity and material evil and exhibit the Promethean dignity of the human spirit. Toward this stance, Skinner is both contemptuous and compassionate. His ambivalence may be summed up in the old saw "Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do." Skinner agrees that the nub of the problem is the ignorance of his soul-intoxicated op ponents, but he is not about to "forgive" them while there remains the faintest hope of pumping in enough informa tion about behavioral technology to sober them up. There is yet another way of viewing the dream that Skinner dreams in Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It is the ancient dream of materially sophisticating a hunk of matter until it springs into life. In the Gilgamesh epic, Aruru did it by cleverly mixing some water and clay until man emerged from the goo. Genesis tells us that the "Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being." The Hebraic account already contains the conviction that the human being is dually constituted, an amalgam of mind and body, matter miraculously animated, and not merely a mechanical sweetheart. It is not far from Genesis to Pope's picture of man ambivalently placed somewhere between God and the rest of creation, doubting whether he is the more god-like or the more bestial. But whether we attrib ute the urge to original sin or derive it from man's natural cleverness, man has always had a yen to displace the Deity and play creator himself. Pygmalion desperately wanted his beautiful handiwork to come to life and?wanting it badly enough?she (it?) did. Dr. Frankenstein accomplished something similar even though the results of his laboratory work lacked the artistic quality of Pygmalion's animated stonework. Skinner's dream is not unrelated to all those that preceded his. Admittedly Skinner is modest enough not to see himself as the actual architect who materially sophisticates matter until it springs into life and begins to feel, discourse, and act. He gives to Evolution the "creative" urge and contents himself with the role of press-agent for untutored Nature's ability to bring forth without effort what to soul-clouded eyes seems a miracle. Something like this lies behind Skinner's irritation with mystification, naivete, faith, soul, "humanism" and its mythical trappings. They are all unconsciously intended to puff up a machine by installing a falsely potent ghost in its innards. "Mind steals the show." (p. 12) Yesterday all this story-telling was a harmless, even sometimes a useful, self-delusion. Today this romantic optimism, plus a half-way science and technology, means practical ineffectuality in an unforgiving environment. If we do not overcome our reluctance to seize and manipulate the real control-levers that lie available in life's environment we will soon be done for. It is because romantic optimism is so deadly dangerous in this world that Skinner intends his book to detoxify those?the majority apparently?who are still drunk with anthropomorphic fantasy about the human machine. bkinner, I believe, isolates the real threat in the mistaken notion of cause that clings to the "autonomous inner man" vaguely designated by "soul" or "mind." What isa cause? For Skinner, a cause is a force that produces a change, an effect. Again, a borrowed, non-Skinnerian example will suffice. A cue-ball strikes a stationary billiard-ball and the struck ball moves toward the pocket. The cue-ball's motion is the cause and the billiard-ball's observed motion is the effect. At the moment, the complications of the example are not particularly important, but they will be later. What causes the cause? Answer: A previous motion. Question: Can the effect also be a cause? Answer: Yes. While heading toward the pocket, the billiard-ball may strike another ball and cause it to move, and so on. It is true that this example is sorely defective if one has in mind the actual predictive formulae of modern science, including modern behavioral science. The fact is that the language of cause and effect is part of a vocabulary that, while it serves well enough in the crude early stages of scientific inquiry, tends to become un necessary and even irrelevant as the science becomes more sophisticated. Who can distinguish cause from effect in Einstein's formula for the space-time constant? And what purpose would it serve to try to do so? None. Skinner seems to be quite aware of this {e.g., p. 7) and is hugely confident that he could argue his position in terms of the defined constructs that occur in a statement of a complex 72 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 197 Z</page><page sequence="4">schedule of variable reinforcements of behavior, but the fact is that throughout his book he relies upon a simple, non dynamic reading of the cause-effect relation that accounts for a good deal of the hearty simplicity that makes his argument carry whatever plausibility it does. For the heart of Skinner's attempt to wipe out freedom and dignity comes in his frequent declaration that the contents of the human mind are the effects, never, never the causes of any modification of behavior. I repeat. Skinner declares that the human mind is a passive recipient of material causes. Let me elaborate by another example. I want to write a review of Beyond Freedom and Dignity, but being dilatory by nature and distracted by a thousand other things, I don't manage to get to the typewriter soon enough to prevent feeling a certain uneasiness, then a real worry. Finally, enough upset by the embarrassing and very real possibility that the deadline will actually arrive and that I must face my editor empty-handed as well as empty headed, I begin to push down the keys driven by a sense of duty, spiced with proleptic guilt, and I work fitfully, har ried by a combination of a forgiving and understanding ego and a sarcastic Simon Legree of a superego. The language of my description, although not foreign to any reluctant writers among my readers, is, technically, just backwards for Skinner. I say that my "wanting" to write moves me sluggishly to act and behave, and I say that my fears, guilts, and potential embarrassments interact with other half conscious and half-understood mental determinants to overcome the reluctance I feel and, finally, to produce some visible marks on the blank paper in front of me?which reduces my anxiety. No. All wrong. While I cannot recap what I just offered in "explanation" of my hesitant writing of this review in purely behavioral terms, neither can Skinner. His claim is that, in principle, the affective language used above contains an implicit claim that inten tions, feelings, wills, fears, senses of duty, and the like produce ("cause") the "outer man's" behavior. And the sequence is always translatable into what I shall call behaviorese. "Behaviorese"?a term I just invented?simply marks out a language which contains no place for any non observable mental words?words like "intention," "purpose," "desire," and the like. Skinnerism is the thesis that all the causes, all the "real" causes, occur (or someday soon will occur) in behaviorese. But there is a certain class of effects?the contents of mind?that never get expressed in behaviorese. The implication is that nothing fully real is missed by confining oneself to behaviorese. Put it another way. One can say in behaviorese everything that the old tradition thought it was saying. If this is not wholly clear to the reader, it is because it is not clear to this writer?and I contend it is not even clear to Skinner himself. To put it in terms of my earlier talk about the interaction of billiard-balls, what this view denies is that when we talk about behavior some "billiard-balls" can produce motion but others are sterile. While mind and matter are not fully comparable to a field of billiard-balls, the fact of interaction in both cases seems evident enough. If there is such a thing as a mind (which Skinner does not clearly deny) and it does have feelings, perceptions, and thoughts, why should behavioral science not be open to the possibility of causal interplay? How, given the relatively undeveloped state of behavioral psychology, can one be sure that none of its future laws will require a mental variable? Toward this, Skinner's stance seems to be that behaviorese will suffice to describe the whole person because it must. Otherwise, psychology would not be precisely like physics and chemistry, and otherwise Skinner's laboratory wisdom would not, in principle, be extendable to the whole human interaction with the environment. Let it be granted that this would be unhandy and messy for someone whose faith rests on the adequacy of behaviorese. But this is by no means the same thing as establishing behaviorese as the sole adequate language of psychology. Skinner makes the astounding claim that he could write his whole book in behaviorese (pp. 23-24) but he never tries even a paragraph or two as a demonstration. I conclude that the claim is empty posturing. I am willing to try the patience of my readers with another metaphor. Mind, for Skinner, is a motorless dinghy being towed by a powerful ocean-liner. In order to trace the course of the dinghy, one can ignore what the crew has charted for its course; they have no choice but to be carried along wherever the captain on the bridge of the ocean-liner wants to go. No matter how loudly the crew in the dinghy shouts, the captain never hears them and never alters his course. (The analogy is terribly defective. For one thing, though there are powerful diesels propelling the liner, there is no captain on the bridge?the course of both vessels is simply the resultant of the liner's responses to the wind and the water together with the characteristics engineered into the vessel.) So Skinner claims to know that what actually went on while I fidgeted about this review can be explained without any residue attributable to some "inner" causation. "I," says Skinner, refers to a certain focus of matter that is the resultant of a lengthy causal chain of behavioral modifica tions that now emerge as dispositions to behave out of a particular repertoire of ways triggered by outside stimuli. "I" is a name, simply, for the current residue of the im mensely complex existence-struggles of my earliest ances tors (a puddle of potent amino acids cauterized by a few flashes of lightning) down and around and through the adventures of the germ plasm until the result emerges as what I represent to be "me." But "I" isn't something I did or anything that, by taking thought or screwing up my courage, "I" helped to develop or that "I" could conceivably modify now. In this respect, though not in all others, "I" am on the same footing as the desk chair I now sit upon. There is no mystery here. While there is more complexity and a far larger behavioral repertoire associated with "me" than with the desk-chair, I should resist my superstitious feeling that the congeries of particles that constitute me are subtly inhabited by some active being that "steals the show" from the real causes, those operative during the whole course of evolution that has happened to slow to a temporary pause in this vibrating clump of molecules. The foregoing is only a part, though the biggest part, of the Skinnerian reduction and reversal of the situation. The THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 197Z 73</page><page sequence="5">complement to this set of causes is the schedule of positive and negative reinforcements constituting my life-history up to this moment as, at long last, I am actually manipulating typewriter keys. Put the two together?genetic endowment and reinforce ment history?and a complete explanation of my behavior is available, in principle. But it won't wash. Skinner's notion of a scientific psychology is, as we have said, something not argued but declared. If one tries to reconstruct what the argument must be, its crude assumptions come out clear and strong. And the joker in the deck is the hoary notion of "cause." The kind of causal relation upon which Skinner founds his entire critique of mentalism is itself prescientific in the following manner. It supposes that science is "materialistic" in a sense that excludes experience and the subject of experience, the self. Since I would assume that Skinner would admit, and even insist, that science is founded upon experience as its source of data, how we can at the same time exclude from its data the very experience on which it is founded is never explained. Whatever may be the stra tegic successes won by the so-called hard sciences in the purifying of their objects of study from projected purposes and intentions, the same strategy cannot be simply trans ferred by fiat to the science of behavior, for here, to put it paradoxically, the experiencing self studies and relates portions of experience to other portions of its own experi ence, part of which naturally is the experience of the behav ior of others. Behaviorese insists that only matter can interact with matter to produce a change. But this crude prejudice has long since been shown groundless. David Hume demonstrated in the eighteenth century the emptiness of the rationalist assumption of the assumed "necessary connection" between a cause and its effect, or at least showed that this dogma had no experiential basis. All that "cause" can mean, experientially, if Hume is right, is covered by statistical probability and involves no mysterious "power" in the cause necessarily to create the effect. If Skinner believes science is experiential, then, and if the connections of observed variables in psychology involve experienced and (inferentially) observed relations between intentions and behavior, between purposes and behavior, between feelings and behavior, then there is no good scientific reason for denying that such relationships cannot somehow enter into the laws of psychology. If this is so, then the "inner man" is not wholly autonomous, but neither is he necessarily merely the impotent receiver of material and behavioral causes. The evidence seems to suggest that man is a psycho physical complex, with his behavior and his conscious experience dynamically related and complexly interacting both within and without the person. Genesis is not as out-dated as Skinnerians may imagine. The truth seems to be that science itself?as science takes no position on the "reality of matter" or the "reality of mind." Science contents itself with what can be observed, with what can be worked out mathematically to function in a predictive law, and it does not methodologically exclude a class of observable or experienceable variables on the grounds that they cannot be expressed in a language that calls upon no vocabulary except that of physics-chemistry. There is an opposite danger of allowing psychology to get defined as "the science of consciousness," illegitimately excluding the behavioral variables and their influence upon consciousness and its contents. The "correction" of that error is not to deny the legitimacy of intention, purpose, and feeling as candidates for scientific explanation, but to encounter the phenomenon of the person in his experienced wholeness and to pursue the task of explanation of the entire complex person's experience as well as his behavior. But not excluding his experience. One of the ways that Skinner proposes to demonstrate the reduction of the mental to the material in Beyond Free dom and Dignity is the citing of statements that include apparent mentalistic components and then translating them into behaviorese. These attempts are apparently serious and at the same time quite amusing. The reader who has an appetite for examples of these embarrassing demonstrations of Skinner's inability to make behaviorese say what the original statement says is referred to Chomsky s two reviews of Skinner earlier mentioned. Though Skinner does not identify his own work as prophetic, it implies prophecy. A Superpsychologist of, maybe, a century from now could consult his book of formulae, get a reading on my genetic materials, accumu late the relevant variables in the history of the reinforce ments contributed to that genetic material by its environ ment up to the depression of these typewriter keys, and then code the composite data into a decent computer array and wait a few seconds for this review to be printed out. And if you and I could clamp on the electrodes right now and climb into a forward-geared time machine and search the data that the Superpsychologist had read into the tapes that fed the computer, we would discover not a single 74 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 1972</page><page sequence="6">instance of a variable that could be read out as "worry," "guilt," "inner needs" or anything of the sort. Indeed, there would be no category of variables in the data that corresponds to the "I" to which I have been earlier at tributing such purposes, frustrations, and fears. The behavior in question would have been "explained" in every and any legitimate sense of that word and it would not have been necessary to encode anything beyond behaviorese. Again we have touched in this example on the essence of Skinnerism, although he would have to regard me as a bad expositor since I read science fiction where he records scientific "fact." Vjnly one thing remains, and that is to generalize the result of the small excursion into science fiction in which I have indulged. In every case where a change in behavior is attributed to some mental cause, the real causes will turn out to be behavioral (stateable, that is, in behaviorese) and in no conceiveable case, past or future, will it be necessary to code into the computer any of the classes of alleged variables under the pseudo-rubric of "the mind" in order to summon up a truly LaPlacean power to map the course of human behavior from the crack of dawn to the knell of doom. While my examples and efforts at analogies have stressed the shape of the coming science of behavior as sketched by Skinner, Skinner himself?while implying that the theory has a shape something like that I have given it?is more interested in practice than in theory. Skinner is less interested in the pure scientist's dream of a completed theoretical account of behavior in neat behaviorese than he is in behavior modification. More bluntly he is?at least in Beyond Freedom and Dignity?far more centered on the control of behavior than he is in the dream of complete elaboration of theory that can be fantasied by spreading out the glory-road future of behavioresed psychology. So, for the purposes of understanding what Beyond Freedom and Dignity is driving at, we can be content with a simple sketch of op?rant conditioning. An "op?rant" is merely a piece of behavior which appears without any obvious stimulus having produced it. Op?rants are rein forced by some events and not by others. The objects associated with the reinforcing event are "reinforcers" and reinforcers can become associated with objects of secondary significance which then select the original responses. (That is, in non-behavorese, I want food but I need money to get it and so I want money.) The strength of an op?rant can be measured by the rate of the response during withdrawal of reinforcement. The eventual result is the extinction of the response. (That is, again in non-behaviorese, I come to a utopia where there is abundant food and no money, but my previous greedy habits hang on and I continue to squirrel away money and other valuables, until, one fine day, I simply cease to want money.) Skinner's experiments with rats in a box with a bar to press and his experiments with pecking behavior of pigeons seem to indicate that in a relatively short time, with attention to intermittent reinforcement according to careful scheduling, the behavior of these animals can be molded in a remarkable variety of ways under the experimenter's control. (Those readers who may find this skimpy summary of op?rant conditioning too sparse and want to know more are referred to Skinner him self in Verbal Behavior, The Behavior of Organisms, and Schedules of Reinforcement, or unless powerfully condi tioned to be reinforced by dense reading matter, they may find it possible to content themselves with Chomsky's definitive review of Verbal Behavior in Language, 35, 1959, available in a Bobbs-Merrill reprint, No. A-34.) A rather surprising fact is that the present review contains more detail about op?rants than does Beyond Freedom and Dignity. While Skinner directs the reader to plenty of references to his own works in the back of the book, the text is not cluttered up with detail about op?rant conditioning. Instead he merely warns the reader that he will discuss the issues from a scientific point of view but adds that "this does not mean that the reader will need to know the details of the scientific analysis of behavior. A mere interpretation will suffice." (p. 22) Skinner must have had in mind the character of his intended audience as well as the urgency of the world crisis. So he limits him self to cryptic declarations, never condescending to argue for those declarations or even to provide a summary of the evidence that might support them. I suspect that his decision also relieves him of some embarrassing discon tinuities between assertion and evidence. But perhaps we have already lingered too long on theory. Skinner leaps avidly toward the large implications he sees for the global concerns of human beings slumbering in their dogmatic humanism while in the midst of a threatened civilization. We shall now, having given a more than decent introduction, follow him in his extrapolation from rats and pigeons to the peculiar habits of the human organism. Adopting the heuristic assumption that the "autonomous inner man" has been expelled, the practical question becomes one of the arrangement of the contingencies of reinforcement that will assure survival. But this seems, at first blush, to involve a question of values. If the autono mous inner man is not available as the initiator of values, where do they come from? Skinner's answer bowls us over with its devastating simplicity. Good is merely positive reinforcement; bad is negative reinforcement. And the science of op?rant conditioning doubles in brass as the science of human values. This comes close to saying that good is pleasure and bad is pain. This amounts to classical hedonism and it will be convenient to speak as if he were a hedonist. The trouble with such a label, for Skinner, is not that it is substantively incorrect as a value system, but that it implies that the heart of the matter lies in certain qualities of feeling?and feeling, we are repetitively told, is only a "by-product." Thus the vital question is not the description of feelings?of any sort?but the production of techniques for controlling and changing behavior. Get the behavior changed and the feelings will track behind like the dinghy being towed by the ocean-liner. If someone positive ly reinforced feels pleased, it seems apparent to Skinner that to concentrate on the pleasure is to lose ourselves in prescientific irrelevance. Though I cannot recall a mention of Marx's name in the text of Beyond Freedom and THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 1972 75</page><page sequence="7">Dignity (incidentally, there is no index), the impatience Skinner feels with the traditional focus of ethical discussion is an impatience similar to that which Marx felt when con fronted with Feu er bach's abstract humanism: "The phi losophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it." To tell someone to love his neighbor is just plain irresponsible, Skinner holds. For if you want to produce behavior in someone that reinforces certain tendencies of another person, you must set about to control the contingencies of reinforcement so that the behavior is likely to occur. But to harangue the man about love, as if that mind stuffed with "by-products" could get off its duff and begin to practice love in a world where reinforcement of the opposite tendencies is common, is ignorant, even if well-intentioned, hot air. After this, the rest can be inferred easily enough. Here is a sample: ". . . The issue of fairness or justice is often simply a matter of good husbandry. The question is whether reinforcers are being used wisely." (p. 112) This tells us little about justice since the definition contains ethically-flavored terms that are undefined, like "wise" and "good." If we ask about the meanings of these terms, I gather we will be told more about arranging contingencies of reinforcements but little about how to recognize which ones are "wise" or "good." Or, as a sample of the translation of an ethical precept into behaviorese, consider the following: "You should tell the truth" is said to be the equivalent of "If you are reinforced by the approval of your fellow men, you will be reinforced when you tell the truth." (p. 112) While the translation is not even close to good behaviorese, neither does it come close to capturing the meaning of the statement it presumes to translate?which at the very least implies that one ought to tell the truth regardless of whether he is positively reinforced or negatively reinforced. A duty to tell the truth is said by some moralists to get its special character precisely from its independence of all reinforcing tendencies of the environment. Skinner could say that such a state ment is meaningless and thus would not appear in behavior ese; but purporting to translate it with an equivalent in terms of contingencies of reinforcement flatly fails. In the chapter on values, and for that matter throughout the book, Skinner retains his privilege of talking about the self and its feelings as if they were really relevant to the description. But apparently he does so with the tacit reservation that it could all be translated into the real stuff of behaviorese if only his audience were not so conditioned to a misleading mentalistic vocabulary. But these niceties are for Skinner's main thrust somewhat beside the point. His worries about survival in the face of our destruction of the conditions that could permit survival are dominant in the chapter on values as they are elsewhere. And so he insists on seeing the problem as one of arranging an environment wherein the personal reinforcers are linked by effective conditioning with the non-personally reinforcing circumstances that will make for future survival of the species, even though the individual is doomed to die. If all this sounds a bit clumsy, I must wearily agree. By promoting a bastardized behaviorese, Skinner has, to my mind, not clarified the problem of survival but befogged it. If one puts aside the attempt to frame things in the Skinnerian nomenclature, it is much easier to speak, but you must bear in mind that Skinner regards it as egregiously incorrect. If personal good is pleasure and personal evil is pain, and if self-sacrifice is required in order to serve the good of the group, how can the individual be persuaded to do what must be done to serve the social good? Freedom is the bug-bear, since to the prescientific savage it suggests that controls?of any sort?are bad things. But, if one's hangups about freedom are cured by the stiff dose of behaviorese earlier prescribed, then the answer clearly emerges. One simply finds a way to control the environ ment?the contingencies of reinforcement?in such a way that the controlled persons behave, without a visible lash or prod, to find personally reinforcing precisely the behavior which is necessary for social survival. It is an article of Skinnerian faith that such control can be exercised "without deferred aversive consequences." Again, if one may be allowed to desert behaviorese, it's not all that hard to say it. Benevolent despotism is better than egoistic freedom in the long run, even though it doesn't appeal to pleasure-seekers in the short run. Trying to condition readers to favor a world better in the long run is what the rest of Beyond Freedom and Dignity is about. For one thing, what one is sorely tempted to call Skinner's "brave new world" will be a world without punishment?as ordinarily conceived. The key point is once again the forced abdication of the "responsible" inner man. If it is the environment that is "responsible" (Skinner has no qualms about anthropomorphizing the environment?claiming that it gets the "credit" and the "blame"), the punishment of individuals, assuming falsely that they could have willed something other than to act as they did, is insanity. Nor is it of any real use to pussyfoot around with tender-minded therapy or pedagogical persua sion of the usual sort in order to induce behavioral change without imposing strong control. These weak measures of control, while they rationalize the queasiness of the defender of freedom overtly to control another, merely shift the actual control elsewhere. We see Skinner setting aside the retributive model of punishment that goes along with classical freewill, and adopting the utilitarian mode of punishment that goes along with classical determinism. The question whether someone deserves punishment is not really a question of "desert," but merely a question of the probable future results of countercontrol exercised because of a failure of the environmental controls in the first place. In a prudently organized world the environmental controls will operate effectively enough to make aversive counter control in the form of punishment quite unnecessary. The rest of the book is concerned with the elaboration, very little new being brought forward, of the problem posed in early chapters?survival. And the Skinnerian prescrip tion, based on behaviorese, amounts to nothing more but nothing less than the recognition of the desperate need for making Skinnerian philosopher-kings out of the holders of power in the society. All the other Skinnerian assumptions must be assumed to be enforced?the autonomous inner man displaced, the urge to ask who will actually exercise 76 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/SPRING 1972</page><page sequence="8">power and any doubts about his moral capacity dispelled, the reality of the crisis of civilization admitted, and the adequacy of the behavioral technology right now at our disposal recognized. Then, on some fateful day, we trade off the myth of freedom and dignity for the promise of survival of our civilization, even though we will not live to enjoy the allegedly "non-aversive" long-term con sequences of the prudently arranged contingencies of reinforcement. Perhaps the largest question that Skinner sees is the question he repeatedly returns to in Beyond Freedom and Dignity, the question of how to get people reinforced by the unselfish requirements of species survival. We're producing too many children because we're strongly re inforced sexually. Why should any individual reduce his gratification because of the population threat? There is no "good reason," of course, in the Skinnerian system; there is only the application of what an earlier tradition called sanctions. More bluntly, a way must be found gently to force individuals by reinforcement to do what they would otherwise rather not do. The same goes for all the other re inforcing things that individuals selfishly permit themselves ?industrial profits that wreck the very conditions for survival, but which are strongly reinforcing for individuals and for groups in the short run. Another way of presenting the same problem is the expression used by Richard Falk in This Endangered Planet. He calls it the paradox of aggregation. The depletion of resources, for example, through the uninhibited pursuit of individual (and national) aggrandizement is something that will eventually harm?or outright destroy?all of the commercial pirates who plunder the ecosphere. But individual restraint is, from the individual standpoint, absurd. Unless there is universal restraint in conservation, the individual who reduces his own greedy spending of irreplaceable natural resources simply opens the way for an increased exploitation by those less finicky than he. Skinner's solution for the paradox of aggregation is that we must begin to control by adequate positive sanctions what we can never hope to control by weak positive measures or even by the most brutal negative measures of punishment. There is no gainsaying the fact that Skinner, whatever you and I may think about the quality of his arguments, has highlighted a desperate and pressing human problem. But will men "freely" take the measures necessary to save them selves and their threatened civilization from Judgment? I greatly doubt it. Not because of having read Skinner's book, but because of the books of Ehrlich, Commoner, and Falk that he and I both seem to have read. The out come hangs on tortuous "ifs." If men are as foolishly greedy as I suspect?if the biosphere is as fragile as I am told ?if the ruination of the ecosphere is as far advanced as those who should know claim?then man's earthly nest is his coffin. Skinner's utopia offers a way out of the doom. Would you prefer to be controlled by benevolent Controllers manipulating people like trained pigeons in order to preserve the civilized world for a while longer, or would you prefer to take your chances with freedom and dignity? Coming in the NAR: Reviewing Skinner's Reviewers by Gordon Harrington New Fiction by Joyce Carol Oates, David Madden, and others A Special Poetry Supplement As I put the question, it is so weaselly that it probably fails to pose sensible alternatives. The civilization that could be preserved through Skinnerian controls will not be the present one. Precisely the elements that I most value must be destroyed in order to assure its survival. Thus, supposing the adequacy of the controls, they will fail to preserve what I take to be the distinctive values of human civilization. The ironic parallel with the explanation offered, apparently in innocent good faith, by the lieutenant who ordered the leveling of the village of Ben Tre is quite perfect. The village, he said, "had to be destroyed in order to save it." But I doubt that Skinner would be disturbed by the parallel. He seems to regard the question of a present person's willingness to live in a controlled society as irrelevant, perhaps meaningless. Conditioned by my past, my mind muddled by the myth of freedom and dignity, I will indeed report that I do not "like" the pros pect of a controlled society. Skinner would say that the real question is whether the people who actually live in that future society would "like" it. And, supposing it could all be brought off as Skinner envisages it, the answer will be that this "liking" is part of the program of the Controllers who arrange the contingencies of reinforcement in a way guaranteed to result in feelings of satisfaction in the minds of the citizens. The situation is illustrated by the horror of the Savage in Huxley's Brave New World at the habits of the soma-happy society to which he was abruptly trans ported by the Alpha-Plus, Bernard. Had the Savage been decanted instead of born, and properly conditioned by hypnopedia like the others, he would have found himself both controlled and satisfied. Shortly after Eve accepted the apple and offered it to Adam, their descendants began to work industriously to subdue the earth and to build in it a substitute for the paradise lost. And now the substitute seems to be failing us. Does Skinner offer an apple without a worm? Is he a Serpent or a True Prophet? -Thomas H.
