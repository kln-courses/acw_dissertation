Voltaire described England as a country with a hundred religions and only one sauce. In view of the size and estimated population of China, and of the common Chinese saying that " the three religions are one," he would probably have felt M. Granet's title to be a misnomer; but it is not. M. Granet's aim is to elucidate the religion par excellence of the Chinese, the official religion, now known as Con- fucianism, the beginnings of which date back to primeval times, and the development of which was effected through the great kings of old, through Confucius (d. 479 B.c.), Mencius (d. 289 B.C.), Chu Hsi (d. 1200 A.D.), and others, down to the present day. Thus we have a chapter on the religion of the peasant, as seen in the rural life of early ages, with its mysteriously sacred spots, its beliefs, and its popular mythology. This is followed by a chapter on religion under the feudal system, town-life as opposed to country-life, with its more highly developed worship of what M. Granet calls " le Ciel," just as for a long period English scholars spoke of the same object of worship as " Heaven." It has been shown, however, by Mr. L. C. Hopkins that the Chinese character in question, T'ien, is a picture of an anthropomorphic Being, and may therefore be more correctly translated by " God." This same chapter further treats of the all-important Ancestor Worship and of several local cults. Chapter III. is devoted to the official religion, an outcome in its beginnings from the feudal religion which had already begun to extend its scope and to become a national and no longer a class religion as heretofore. It was taught by scholars who accepted Confucius as their guide and who sought to explain his doctrines. Its ethics were based upon the ancient Canon, but its metaphysical teachings were derived from a variety of sources. Its ceremonial observances were in many cases survivals from feudal rule, adapted as time went on to the changed conditions of an empire. Chapter IV. deals somewhat unsatisfactorily with Taoism and Buddhism, and the work ends with a fifth chapter on religious feeling in modem China. The details given by M. Granet are multitudinous, and it would be easy to point out omissions, inaccuracies, and even contradictions; but it is fairer to regard the work as a whole, especially as it would be impossible to do justice either to M. Granet or to his readers in a brief notice like this. M. Granet rarely mentions the sources of his inspiration and never once gives a direct reference to his authorities. These are familiar enough to every advanced student of Chinese, his work being a digest of the Confucian Canon, with perhaps special drafts upon the Book of Rites, the Rites of the Chow Dynasty, and the Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial, trans- lated by Dr. Legge, M. Biot and Dr. Steele, respectively. He has drawn upon the researches and translations of previous writers, marshalling lucidly facts already known, without adding any new ones. The one great defect of a very interesting book is that there is no index, and that points which a reader may wish to recall cannot be easily recaptured. H. A. GILES.
