London &amp; New York: Rout- ledge, 1997. Pp. 301. Reviewed by RAUL ARANOVICH, University of Texas at San Antonio This is a revision of van der Wouden's doctoral dissertation, which he submitted to the Univer- sity of Groningen, The Netherlands, in 1994. The central issue in the work is the variation in the distribution of negative polarity items and the differences in strength among polarity triggers. The data are primarily from Dutch, but examples from English, German, French, Spanish, Afri- kaans, Kurdish, and other languages are also discussed. To account for the variety of negative contexts, W proposes a hierarchy of functions expressed by the triggers, based on their boolean properties. This is a refinement of the semantic analysis proposed in Ladusaw (1979), according to which negative polarity items must be licensed by monotone-decreasing operators. W extends this approach to constructions involving multiple negations, claiming that the expressions that trigger negative concord constructions, litotes, denial, and emphatic negation can be found among the whole range of monotone decreasing operators. The book presents a dual approach to polarity phenomena and to multiple negation constructions. W argues that whereas 'the mechanisms underlying the behaviour of polarity items are part of grammar, the specific behaviour of individ- ual polarity items is part of the lexicon' (80). This book presents a semantic theory to explain differences in the licensing properties of the triggers, but to answer the question of the nature of polarity sensitivity W suggests that this is a case of lexical limited distribution. The author treats polarity sensitivity as a collocational phenomenon. A discussion of the notion of collocation constitutes the topic of the first of the three sections that comprise the book. The definition of collocation presented in this section is used throughout the other two sections in the explanation of the limited distribution of the licensees in negative constructions. W's definition of collocation departs from the commonly accepted opinion that collocations are lexically restricted on the encoding side but not on the decoding side (Fillmore et al. 1988). He uses the term 'collocation' as the most general term, to denote any instance of lexical limited distribution which does not seem to be motivated by general principles of grammar. W argues that no taxonomy of collocations or other fixed expressions can be exhaustive, and that the expressions covered by the term 'collocation' are too heterogeneous to be classified as a particular type of dependency. W shows that collocations are not restricted to a single syntactic category or to a certain semantic class. Nouns collocate with adjectives, as in blond hair, and adverbs with verbs, as in sleep soundly. Collocations also occur above the word level, as in it's raining cats and dogs. W also shows that many polarity-sensitive expressions (lift a finger, give a red cent) are also collocational, an issue that will resonate through the rest of the chapters in this book. In the second section, W introduces a hierarchy of triggers for negative polarity based on their boolean properties. At the bottom of the hierarchy are antimorphic functions like Dutch allerminst 'least of all, not at all' followed by anti-additive expressions such as nooit 'never'. At the top of the hierarchy W places operators like nauwelijks 'hardly', which are just monotone decreasing. The hierarchy has a formal foundation since anti-additive functions are also monotone decreasing, and antimorphic functions are also anti-additive. This hierarchy, which is the most original contribution in this work, explains some generalizations about the distribution of negative polarity items in Dutch. If a polarity-sensitive item is licensed by a downward entailing operator, then it will also be licensed by an anti-additive and an antimorphic operator. Weak polarity items like hoeven 'need' have this property. On the other hand, if a polarity sensitive item is licensed by an anti-additive operator, it will also be licensed by antimorphic operators but not necessarily by downward entailing operators. Medium polarity items like ook maar 'at all' have this property. Finally, W identifies a class of strong polarity items, like the Dutch idiomatic expression mals 'tender' (meaning not hard in a negative context), which are only licensed by antimorphic operators. This chapter provides a detailed picture of the variation in strength and distribution among negative polarity items in Dutch, which is inspired by Ladusaw's (1979) analysis of 589</page><page sequence="2">LANGUAGE, VOLUME 75, NUMBER 3 (1999) negative polarity in English and by Zwarts's (1981) analysis of the distribution of hoeven and ook maar. W's book, then, is the continuation of a long line of work on the boolean properties of the triggers for negative polarity, which he acknowledges, and it makes a compelling case for taking boolean semantics into consideration in natural language semantics. In the third section W extends the semantic analysis of negative polarity to multiple negations. He distinguishes four types of constructions involving multiple negations: negative concord (or negative attraction), paratactic (or expletive) negation, denial, and emphatic negation. Each of these constructions is the subject of a different chapter. W strives to show that multiple negations are not limited to negation proper but that they involve all classes of monotone-decreasing operators. For instance, the Dutch monotone-decreasing expressions weinig 'little' can occur with Dutch mis 'wrong' to yield a positive evaluation, proving that litotes is not limited to negative particles. Even though this book does not offer a predictive theory of what constitutes a trigger for multiple negations, it identifies certain interesting tendencies. After analyzing negative concord constructions in French, Afrikaans, and other languages, W shows that negative concord triggers are usually anti-additive, antimorphic, or antimultiplicative but almost never just mono- tone decreasing. The insightful and detailed analyses of the semantic properties of the triggers in multiple negatives compensate for the lack of a conclusive semantic theory about multiple negations. This is not a shortcoming of the author but rather a product of the complexity of the subject he studies. Compared to the richness of the explanation for the different properties of the triggers in negative polarity and multiple negation constructions, W's reduction of polarity sensitivity to collocational behavior seems innocuous. After surveying different attempts to explain the nature of polarity sensitivity, W concludes that the class of polarity-sensitive expressions, like other collocations, is too heterogeneous to fall under a single grammatical generalization and that no semantic classifications of NPIs, no matter how detailed, can predict what will be a polarity- sensitive item on the basis of meaning alone. This position falls behind recent efforts to explain the distribution of polarity items as a result of their semantic and pragmatic properties (Kadmon and Landman 1993, Krifka 1995, Israel 1996). The behavior of polarity-sensitive items seems to be a matter of grammar after all. W also treats multiple negations as a special case of collocational behavior. W adopts the view that negative words are ambiguous between a negative universal reading and a positive existential reading. This ambiguity is contextually determined, with the existential reading limited to cases in which the negative word is in a negative context. In this sense, W claims, multiple negations are collocational since in a collocation the semantic contribu- tion of a lexical item is dependent on the presence of the expression it collocates with. However, no clear evidence is given for the claim that negative words in negative contexts are existential quantifiers. This hypothesis is not without problems either, as Zanuttini (1991), Vallduvi (1994), and others have noticed. These authors offer an alternative analysis of negative words as unambig- uously universal. W surveys their arguments and offers some criticism of the negative absorption theory (which is the mechanism that yields one negation out of multiple negative expressions in a sentence), but the reader will not be able to reach a verdict on the matter. In sum, the book shows that a fine-grained formal semantic analysis of negative contexts can account for the variation in the distribution of negative polarity items. The methodic extension of the semantic explanations of negative polarity to account for multiple negations makes for a coherent book which pushes this approach to its limits. This book puts forth a valid proposal for a general account of negative polarity and multiple negations, and it should be read carefully in all its detail by those working on the subject.

SHANKER, and TALBOT J. TAYLOR. New York &amp; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Pp. x, 244. Reviewed by ROBBINS BURLING, University of Michigan Several decades of disappointing attempts to teach human language to apes have taught lin- guists to be skeptical, but we should put our doubts on hold long enough to take a serious look at the famous Kanzi and the other bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees) that have been studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues at the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Georgia. This book is an always forthright and sometimes eloquent defense of the language and communicative ability of these remarkable apes. The first and longest chapter (3-74), by Savage-Rumbaugh, the primatologist of the group, is a sensitive narrative of Kanzi's behavior and linguistic achievements. S-R describes Kanzi's infancy during his mother's training, the sudden revelation of his communicative skills when he was left without his mother, his subsequent childhood, and finally, the series of careful tests in which nine-year-old Kanzi and a two-and-a-half-year-old human child were found to perform in remarkably similar ways to spoken English instructions. I do not see how we can any longer deny that a bonobo can learn to understand not only a large number of words of spoken English but also to use syntactic clues to interpret the meaning of sentences. Kanzi also uses a keyboard to punch out meaningful signs, and he puts the signs together in communicatively innovative ways. Kanzi cannot use his voice to speak, but S-R fills this chapter with striking examples of his ability to communicate easily with human beings in other linguistic ways. Here and there, I longed for more detail. How, exactly, did Kanzi's mother 'invite' someone to sit with her (19)? What did Kanzi do to let himself be described as having 'smiled and laughed' when tickled (31)? What sort of gesture did he use when he gestured 'come' (39)? When Jeannine (Kanzi's human caretaker) 'commented' (36), did she do so in English or with the keyboard? S-R describes Kanzi as having been, at one time or another, 'frightened', 'confused', or 'suspi- cious', as showing 'curiosity', 'fascination', or 'boredom', as 'wanting', 'wishing', 'trying', or 'objecting'. Some readers may be disturbed at this degree of 'anthropomorphism', but we do not hesitate to attribute such emotions and intentions to prelinguistic children, and I am untroubled about attributing them to Kanzi. The chapter is slightly marred by a rather garbled account of vowels, consonants, and vocal anatomy (12-13). S-R repeats a claim that I have heard from other primatologists, that vowels are more difficult to distinguish than consonants. This seems to rest on a misinterpretation of identification tests in which listeners judge intermediate phones. It is true that the transition in identification between, for example, voiced and voiceless homorganic consonants is more abrupt than between neighboring vowels, but since the vowels and consonants of running speech are rarely intermediate, these tests say nothing about identification during ordinary conversation. We also find the assertion that velar closure allows us 'to produce nasal sounds such as "m" and "n" ' as well as 'plosive consonants such as "k" and "g" '.
