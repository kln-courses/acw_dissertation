<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIGNIFICANCE OF RELIGIOUS DATA IN KAUTILYA'S ARTHAŠĀSTRA Dr. B. P. Sinha , Patna For more than half a century now the Arthasāstra of Kautilya has proved to be a veritable mine of precious knowledge about political and economic ideas and institutions of ancient India. However, the significance of the religious data scattered in the treatise has not received due attention even in some comprehensive histories of ancient India. A close study of the materials given therein enables us to have a glimpse into the contemporary religious ideas and practices. Considerable light is thrown on some aspects of popular religion and beliefs. The problem of the date of Kautilya's Arthasāstra in the light of the critical study of the religious material contained in it may be seen in fresh perspective. The Arthaśastra contains the names of a large number of deities, amongst whom Aparājitā, Apratihata, Jayanta, Vaijayanta, Śiva, Vaishravaņa, Asvins, Indra, Senapati, Brahmā, and Yama, may be mentioned.1 Apratihata is a name of Vishņu, but this epithet of Vishņu finds one of its earliest mentions here. Jayanta is a son of Indra, but we do not find him a deity worshipped in the Epics. Refer- ence to the worship of Indra, Yama, Brahmā or Prajāpati, or Kaśyapa,2 all these famous Vedic deities certainly, suggests quite an early period for the Arthasāstra. How far early the period be may be inferred from the examination of another list of deities and demons grouped together. In connection with the application of medicines and mantras, we find salutations to such demons as Bali, Śatamaya, Sambara, Bhandaripāka, Naraka, Vikumbha, Tantukacha, Ãmarlava, Pramīla, Mandoruka, Ghatotkacha, Kumbha, and saints such as Devala, Nārada, Savarņi-gātava, and also to Krishna and Kamsa and Jayanta.3 Some of these demons such as Samvara, Bali, Vairo- cana, Vikumbha, Naraka and Pulomā are known to the Mahābhārata. But many in the Arthasāstra are not known to the great Epic. It is 1. KA, II. 4. 2. II. 24. 3. XIV. Ü.</page><page sequence="2">62 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS - 1959 quite possible that by the time of the compilation of the Mahābhārata where Hinduism was fairly developed round great gods, memories about some of the demons and their powers were forgotten. But what is most significant is mention of Krishna and Kamsa together in this list with demons preponderating. Dr. Ray Choudhuri4 has proved that Krishna was a historical person to be identified with Vāsudeva, the most important prophet of Bhāgavatism or Vāsudeva -cult. Samkar- shaņa or Balade va was his elder brother who was associated with the Vāsudeva- cult. This cult was quite established in the time of Patañjali who in commenting on Pāņini's reference to worshippers of Vāsudeva says that by this Pāņini meant Vāsudeva, the deity. There is no doubt that Vāsudeva and Ar juna were known to Pāņini ; and that they had large number of followers long after their death. The Ghosundi and the Heliodorus inscriptions definitely show that in the 2nd century B.C. Vāsudeva and Samkarshaņa were popular deities in whose honour temples were constructed or pillars were dedicated. The Nanaghat inscription, slightly later than these, refer to Vāsudeva and Samkar- shaņa as gods. What is important to bear in mind is that there is nothing definite in Pāņini to prove that Vāsudeva-Krishņa was actually deified istadevatā of Bhāgavatisim. Pāņini's reference might suggest Arjuna's and Krishna's popularity as heroes or Mahāpurushas. It is Patañjali who flourished more than at least three hundred years after Panini, who believed that by this Pāņini must have meant deities. There has been actually gradual development of the Vāsudeva cult. The legends of Krishna's life appear to be known to Pāņini and Patañjali. And Kautilya is aware of Krishna and Kamsa. Megasthenes refers to the special honour in which the Sourasenians, who possessed Methore and Chisbera (Mathurā and Krishnapura-Gokul or Brindavana), held Herakles4 (identified with Krishna). So in the time of the First Maurya Krishna was an object of special veneration among the Soura- semians chiefly ; he might have been raised to the status of a deity as a result of the personification of the great hero of their race. So the cult of Krishna- Vāsudeva was neither by then fully developed nor extensively spread. The legends about his exploits, his rivalry with Indra, and his complexion may all lead some to suspect some non- Aryan element in the Krishna-cult.5 Now the reference to salutation to Krishna together with Kamsa and the other demons by Kautilya certainly proves that Krishna- Vāsudeva cult had not in his time reached that stage of development that is found in the time of Ghosundi inscription, or Patañjali (2nd Century B.C.) or Heliodorus. We should place Kautilya therefore much before Patañjali and nearer Megasthenes, may be even somewhat earlier than him. This hypothesis is strengthened by the manner in which Kautilya refers to Samkarshaņa. We have noticed that the Ghosundi and Nanaghat inscriptions refer to Krishna 4. Indika , VIII. o . J. Gonda, Aspects of Vishnuism , p. 7.</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT INDIA 63 and Samkarshaņa close together. Patañjali also refers to Krishna and Samkarshaņa (1-426) and the palaces of Rāma (Balarāma) and Kesava together (I • 436). Kautilya refers to Samkarshaņa but not with Krishna ; moreover the reference to the worshippers of the god Samkarshaņa as ascetics with shaved head or braided hair6 points to time earlier than when Samkarshaņa was a full-fledged member of Vaishņava Vyüha inalienable with Krishna. This also points to Kautilya having written his treatise much earlier than Patañjali or the inscriptions referred to above. There appears to be some reason to believe that images of deities were fashioned and worshipped in the Arthasästra. Patañjali also refers to images made by the Mauryas for the sake of money (v. 3 • 99, Bhasya II. 429), and we are also informed that such images were for worship, for livelihood and for sale. There is a torso of a Tirthankara with characteristics Mauryan polish in the Patna Museum which can safely be placed in the Mauryana period. Aśoka in his inscription refers to celestial sights including the spectacles of Vimina, elephant etc. that he showed to the people (Vimāna-darsana ca hasti-dasana ca, agiknamdhamic. anāni ca divyâni rupāni dasayitpa).7 On interpreta- tion or significance of these phrases there is much controversy. But it is reasonable to suppose that showing certain religious scenes was a part of the religious propaganda, and Aśoka might have modified or utilised for his purpose the popularity of such religious faith in representation in the form of images or symbols. We find in the Kautilya's Arthasãstra the reference to the image of a nāga god (Nāga Prati mā) 8 for the purpose of worship. Another indirect reference to the acquaint- ance with the anthropomorphic images of gods (Daivatapratimā) is to be inferred from Kautilya's advice to the conquering king to frighten his enemies by holding conversation with, and worshipping, the spies, 4 who pretend to be the gods of fire or altar when through a tunnel they come to stand in the midst of fire or altar or in the interior of a hollow image, or by deluding the enemy's people by magical tricks conversing with the Varuņa and Nāga maidens.'9 At another place it is said that ' any person disguised as an ascetic and living under water in the interior of an idol ; entered through a tunnel or an underground chamber may be said by his disciples to be Varuna or king of Snakes.'10 Images of gods are again referred to.11 Worship to Naga gods and goddesses mentioned again.12 But it is important to note that by far 6.

KA, XIII, j .</page><page sequence="4">64 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS- 1 959 Kautilya's references are about images of Nāgas and Varuna for worship. There is no clear reference to images of the more important gods. Kautilya refers to some specific Brahmanical sacrifices such as Asvamedha13 Mahākachavardhana,14 Agnistoma, Consecration of the purchase of Soma (Somavikraya), Madhyamopasad, Pravargya- odvāsana, Maya, Suta, Prātasavana, Medhyadina, and Brihaspatissa- vana.15 There is possibility of human sacrifice as well.18 It will be interesting to find if all the sacrifices specifically referred to by Kautilya were observed in the post-Mauryan period. In Kautilya's time faith in magic and belief in superstitions were widely prevalent. Witchcraft was resorted to for not only personal ends but also for purposes of the State. Atharvaveda was the root of these beliefs and practices for the purpose of warding off the danger from demons. Kautilya observes, ' Persons acquainted with the rituals of the Atharvaveda and experts in sacred magic and mysticism shall perform such ceremonial as ward off danger of demons.'17 Belief in astrology and interpretation of dreams was commonly shared and there- fore experts in magic (mäyäyogavidah)18 astrologers who divined the future,19 and experts who interpreted dreams20 were held in great esteem. Science of magic was developed to such as extent that a type of it was known as Jambhaka.21 Sometimes even to delude credulous people spies by resorting to tricks would demonstrate (seemingly) supernatural powers to apprehend criminals.22 Kautilya advises the king to honour and house such ascetics who are experts in magical arts and are endowed with supernatural powers because they can ward off providential visitations in the kingdom.23 Witchcraft may be properly applied to arouse love in an indifferent wife and in a maiden by her lover. But if the man practised witchcraft for anti-social and injurious ends, he could be punished by the court.24 Witchcraft was also made use of for bringing inexhaustible wealth, or to get entry into the king's palace, to put an end to the life of one's enemy, to win the love of any woman, to lengthen the the duration of one's life and to obtain a son.25 Even in war the parties resorted to 13.

However, it may be interesting to mention some of the innocuous superstitions referred to by Kautilya such as milking of cows on crema- tion grounds, burning the trunk of a corpse, waving light in cow-sheds for combatting cattle diseases. It was certainly a superstitious belief that placing on a verandah offerings such as an umbrella, the picture of an arm, a flag and some goat's flesh will help in warding off the danger from demon.30 It is nothing but superstitious to believe that if a figure of an enemy carved out of rājavriksha is besmeared with the bile of a brown cow killed with a weapon on the 14th day of the dark half of the month, it causes blindness to the enemy.31 The underlying belief was this : - 4 By the power of the mantras and other magical perform- ances one should protect one's own people and hurt those of the enemy.'32 We may now consider evidences, if any, regarding the prevalence of different religious sects in the Arthasāstra. Kautilya refers to ascetics who were living in āshramas and Pāsaņdas33 who thus did not live in āshramas. These might be the wandering acetics all of whom were not necessarily Buddhists.34 There is no clear reference to the Jainas. Only the Buddhists and the Ājīvikas are mentioned.35 Kautilya says that the Āshramakas and the Pāsaņdas could chat in a large area without disturbing one another.36 Kautilya was a champion of orthodox Brahmanism and believed in the Varnãshrama Dhrama. It appears that in his time there was religious ferment and different sects of wandering ascetics were propagating in favour of their beliefs, and some had even organised as he refers to Pāsaņdasangha, which may actually suggest the Buddhist monastic order. Kautilya was very much displeased with these people, who were not to be fed on some 26. X. 3. 27. X. 6. 28. XIII. 1. 29. XIV. 3. 30. IV. 3. 31. XIV. 3. 32. Ibid . 33. III. 16. 34.

Only the Vānaprasthas according to orthodox Hindu scheme of life were allowed to settle. Aśoka appears to have revoked this ban, as he says that the Brāhmaņas and Šramaņas are to be found every- where, and he met them in his tours throughout the empire. The reference to Ājīvika is also significant. We do not hear of the Ajivikas in the Northern India after Daśaratha. The picture of religious situation as indirectly glanced from KA certainly places it in the Mauryan period, and probably before Aśoka when Buddhism had not developed to such an extent that Kautilya could mention it casually as he has done. 37.
