<plain_text><page sequence="1">The John Birch Society: A Profile BARBARA S. STONE THE POLITICAL CONSERVATISM, especially the extreme conservatism, which has characterized much of the contemporary milieu has been an object of considerable interest for students concerned with the- orizing about direct political action. American scholarship seems to have produced a fairly consistent image of the radical rightist. Socially, he tends to be an older, less well-educated individual; eco- nomically, he is usually a person of lower-income and occupational status. He is likely to belong to a fundamentalist religious denom- ination. Psychologically, he exhibits such socially undesirable traits as authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, submissiveness, hostility, rigidity, and compulsiveness.' The extreme conservative is usually identified by certain beliefs which are presumed to indicate radicalism: notably, a belief in a communist conspiracy which has infiltrated the government and institutions of the United States, or by membership in or sympathy with acknowledged rightist groups-particularly the John Birch 1 See T.

On a more academic level, he may be discovered through a priori ideological measures which presumably distribute respond- ents along a liberal-conservative continuum. While the validity of these scales has been questioned, the over-all category of irrational, uneducated, lower-status groups on the extreme right seems to be generally accepted.2 Even critics of the traditional measures of conservatism accept the definition of the extremist. Robert Schoenberger, in an analysis of the membership of the Conservative Party of New York, discov- ered that his findings seriously contradicted the conclusions of other students of conservatism, particularly McClosky and the "Berkeley group." He nevertheless preserved the image of the radical rightist, while distinguishing him from the conservative: . . .two major strains of right-wing attitudes and behavior are distinguishable on the basis of (1) political grounds-one concerned primarily with questions of economic and social policy, the other with a powerful and conspiratorial domestic communist threat; (2) social differences-one a segment of the young, educated, technologically competent and economically successful middle to upper-middle class; the other older, less competent and less "successful" on these dimensions, and (3) psychological differences-one reasonably well ad- justed to their environment and able to cope with, though dissenting from, the major political tendencies of their time, the other hostile toward many of the social forces of the era and less able to keep their social-psychological balance when confronting them.3 Among the several exceptions to this general approach, the most important is Seymour Martin Lipset, who has tied radicalism more to problems of status.4 Most writers, however, seem to accept the social, economic, and psychological homogeneity of the far right which Schoenberger suggests. For Schoenberger and other students of the subject, the second category of less-successful, less-well-balanced individuals is epito- 2 See particularly Richard Christie and Marie Jahoda, Studies in the Scope and Method of "The Authoritarian Personality" (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1954); Rokeach, Open and Closed Mind, 3-30; Willmore Kendall, "Comments on McClosky's 'Conservatism and Personality,"' American Political Science Review, 52 (December 1958), 1,111-1,112; Schoenberger, "Conservatism, Personality, and Political Extremism," American Political Science Review, 62 (September 1968), 868-877. 3 "Conservatism," 876. 4 See his "The Sources of the Radical Right," in The Radical Right, ed.

This organization is probably the most frequently cited example of extreme conservatism translated into concrete political activity. An analysis of the Society's mem- bership would, therefore, represent one test of the coincidence be- tween accepted political categories and their representatives in the political arena. Comparatively little analysis, however, has been directed toward the membership of the Birch organization. Popular literature has concentrated on the group's more sensational publications and ac- tivities.5 Academicians have been limited by the Society's adverse reactions to scholarly inquiries; they too have been compelled to confine themselves primarily to the literature and the utterances of the group's spokesmen. Most studies of the Birch Society, there- fore, become studies of its leadership, of the works of Robert Welch, or of such atypical samples as those members who publicly disclose themselves in letters-to-the-editor.6 The major exception to this practice has been the work of Fred W. Grupp, Jr.7 His study, however, was limited to written contact with an anonymous sample selected by the Society. The question- naires were sent and received by the Society, a process which de- stroyed all possible marks of identification, such as postmarks. The need for more direct contact with and identification of the member- ship of the group is apparent. This paper is an attempt to make some of the necessary contacts and to discover some of the elusive information.

As has been suggested, however, access to the group's membership has been severely limited. The Society does not release its membership lists, and other efforts to identify Birchers are blocked by both the organization and the members themselves. Most members are un- willing to be interviewed, preferring to defer to their leaders as the group's spokesmen. The organization has, furthermore, adopted a very protective attitude, believing that the membership needs and desires protection from unsolicited questionnaires that they view as prying into matters which are not of public concern. The problem of access to the Birch Society has not been properly solved. With the reluctant co-operation of the leadership, how- ever, some satisfaction was achieved in the present study. The sample was selected by the Society itself, but with assurance that it was a random sample. Observation convinced the author that the selection was at least haphazard if not random.8 The sample consisted of 50 members of the John Birch Society in California. A majority came from Southern California, where Birchism has been strongest in both numbers and influence. As others have said, "Southern California is the undisputed center of Birch activity in the United States."9 Each respondent was interviewed for an average of 90 minutes during late 1967 or early 1968. The sample was limited to the low- er, volunteer levels of the organization. Members are organized into chapters of from seven to twenty members, directed by a chap- ter leader, who is also a volunteer. Another volunteer, known as a "section leader," supervises the activities of several chapters. These three groups, members, chapter leaders, and section leaders, were included in the sample, although the leaders occasionally were dif- ferentiated for analytical purposes. The John Birch Society is organized along pyramidal lines. Above the section leaders in the hierarchy is an intermediary group of full-time, paid employees. They in turn are directed by Robert Welch and the council, a core group of advisers appointed by Mr. 8 Conversations with the respondents frequently revealed that they had been called at the last minute by co-ordinators who neglected or forgot to make plans. Apparently the author interviewed whoever was available on short notice rather than a carefully selected sample. 9 Scott C.

Neither the professional staff nor the top leadership was considered representative of the general membership. They were not, therefore, included in the sample. THE FINDINGS Age Contrary to expectations, the respondents to this survey did not represent the older age groupings in the population. The median age was 44 years. An even more significant figure, however, is the mode, or most frequently occurring category, which is represented by the interval 30-39 years. As Table 1 illustrates, this especially characterizes the leadership-chapter and section leaders-within the volunteer group. The remarkable frequency of young persons in positions of leadership might not have been expected in a group with the reactionary image of the John Birch Society, although it is consistent with other investigations of this particular group.'0 The youthfulness of the Society is even further emphasized by the age of the respondents at time of recruitment. Of the individ- uals interviewed, 58 percent were under 40 when they joined the organization. This result seems to indicate an attraction to younger people which has not formerly been attributed to right-wing groups. Education The members of the John Birch Society represent a reasonably well-educated group.

No particular relationship was discovered between level of edu- cation and position in the Society. As might be expected, however, a relationship was found between the sex of the respondent and his educational achievement. The men in the sample tended to be more highly educated than the women. Two-thirds, or 66.6 per- cent, of the men had a college degree or more; about 38 percent had some sort of graduate training. Only about 31 percent of the women held a bachelor's degree, and none of them had advanced work. Occupation and Income The Birch Society members examined here tended to be either housewives or men with white-collar, upper-status occupations (see Table 3). A large proportion of the sample, 42 percent, were housewives, while 34 percent, or about 65 percent of those gain- fully employed, worked in business, management, professional, or technical capacities." Most of the latter group were corporate em- ployees. No lawyers or clergymen were among them, although there were three teachers, including one college professor. The high incidence of housewives may be explained by the string- ent time demands imposed by the Society. Furthermore, house- wives do not hold jobs which they believe might be threatened by 11 The great majority of the women in the sample were housewives. The figures conceal only four women who worked.

This last problem was cited by several women as the reason for the nonparticipation of their husbands, although one might perhaps conjecture that this was an excuse used by some husbands to placate their more zealous spouses. As might be anticipated from the number of professional and management occupations in the sample, the level of family income of the respondents was quite high. None of those who answered had an income of less than $8,000 a year. The median income was $11,000; slightly more than 40 percent of those responding to in- quiries regarding their family income received $15,000 or more a year.

In the Blue Book, Robert Welch ex- tensively discussed the religious background for the morality he preached. While he claimed to appeal to all faiths, his emphasis on evangelism and a belief in an anthropomorphic God who metes out punishments and rewards is an appeal to modern Protestant fundamentalism. It was not, therefore, surprising to discover a high incidence of fundamentalism among the California membership of the Society. As Table 5 reveals, Protestant groups commanded the allegiance of the largest number of respondents, with various fundamentalist sects a fairly popular second choice.13 Furthermore, several of those who nominally belonged to Protestant groups like the Epis- copal Church indicated that they were "searching for a new church." The reason usually given was the connection of their present church to the "liberal" National Council of Churches. Memberships Political activism has been frequently correlated with membership in voluntary organizations.'4 It was, therefore, anticipated that 13 Those designated fundamentalists either attended or belonged to the fol- lowing churches: Apostolic Christian Church, Calvary Bible Presbyterian Church, Churches of Christ, Christward Ministry, Congregational Free Church, Conservative Mayflower Church, Covenant Church, Evangelical Free Church, Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Orthodox Presbyterian, Grace Community Church, First Christian Church, Spiritualist Church. 14 See William Buchanan, "An Inquiry into Purposive Voting," Journal of Politics, 18 (February 1956), 281-296; Robert Agger and Vincent Ostrom, "Political Participation in a Small Community,"' in Political Behavior, ed.

Contrary to expectations, a large portion of the sample belonged to no other voluntary organizations, not even those identified with right-wing causes. When asked if they belonged to any political, community, or national organizations, 48 percent denied any mem- bership at all. Another 24 percent belonged to only one other group -usually a political or professional group-while only eight per- cent reported four or more attachments. Table 6 illustrates the voluntary associations of the sample. The findings demand an explanation. Grupp, in his study of the Birch Society and the Americans for Democratic Action, found that all his respondents belonged to at least one other organization.'5 These results, in combination with more general studies of partici- pation, offer too great a contrast to the findings presented here to be ignored. About half of those who listed no memberships indicated that they had at one time belonged to various groups but had resigned due to the tremendous demands of the Society. This explanation fails to account for the others in the sample who stressed their "individualism" and claimed with pride that they had never been "joiners," despite the fact that they were members of an activity- oriented group such as the Birch organization. It appears evident Eulau, Samuel Eldersveld, and Morris Janowitz (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1956); Herbert Maccoby, "The Differential Political Activity of Participants in a Voluntary Association," American Sociological Review, 23 (October 1958), 524-532; Robert Lane, Political Life (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1959); Wil- liam Erbe, "Social Involvement and Political Activity," American Sociological Review, 27 (April 1964), 198-215. 15 "Social Correlates," 175.</page><page sequence="10">A PROFILE OF THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY 193 that the stresses of modern life are such that individuals who would ordinarily be "loners" feel compelled to political activism. Aliena- tion here leads to activity rather than withdrawal. Their choice of the Society may indicate a disillusionment with the more widely accepted avenues of participation. The existence of this group of nonactivists may explain at least some of the deviation from Grupp's study. People who stress their individualism logically might be assumed to be among those who would fail to return a mailed questionnaire (and Grupp's return rate was only 35 percent).16 These people might resent what they regarded as prying into their private affairs and refuse to respond to such invasions. Hence, they would not be represented in that sample. CONSERVATISM The relationship between conservatism and the radical right has been a matter of considerable debate. Certain authors suggest that political conservatism is one characteristic of the far right and that radicalism is one possible deviation for conservatives who are un- able to match their skills and abilities with new social demands.'7 Others, notably Herbert McClosky, view the far right as being re- lated to conservatism but more extreme on a spectrum ranging from the political left to right.'8 Still others, while not always clear as to the exact nature of the relationship, strongly insist that conserv- atism and radicalism are two distinct phenomena which must be analytically separated's While the present paper cannot settle this debate, it may cast some light on a segment of the subject. The author was able to administer McClosky's scale of classical conservatism to the sample. Since the Birch Society, by universal accord, belongs on the far right, the responses of its membership might reveal a great deal about both McClosky's measure and the subsequent inferences he drew regarding the characteristics of extreme conservatives. 16 Ibid., xxv 17 See, for example, Mark Chesler and Richard Schmuck, "On Super- Patriotism: A Definition and Analysis," Journal of Social Issues, 19 (January 1963), 31-50. 18 McClosky, "Conservatism and Personality," 29-34. 19 See Schoenberger, "Conservatism;" Rohter, "Social and Psychological De- terminants."</page><page sequence="11">194 THE JOURNAL OF POLITCS, VOL. 36, 1974 TABLE 7 DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSES OF BIRCH SOCIETY MEMBERS ON MCCLOSKY'S SCALE OF CONSERVATISM Number of Birchers Number of Affirmative Responses 40 35 30 Liberal &lt; Conservative 25 20 Median 15 10 9 11 10 5 5 4 5 0 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The McClosky scale is composed of nine items with which the individuals in the sample were asked to either agree or disagree. Each affirmative answer was a conservative response. Of the 50 Birchers interviewed, 49 responded to the items. The overwhelm- ing majority clearly were not conservative as the term was opera- tionalized by McClosky. When affirmative answers are accepted as an index of conservatism, respondents who disagreed with more items than they agreed with must be categorized as liberals. Nearly 80 percent of the Birchers responding were, therefore, liberals on the scale (see Table 7). Furthermore, four of the others concurred with only five of the items-hardly an indication of extreme con- servatism as used in this context. The results certainly tend to cast some doubt upon the validity of McClosky's scale. They must, therefore, cast further doubt upon the other results of his study. McClosky examined the relationship between his dependent vari- able-the "conservatism" of the subject-and the independent vari- ables-those social and psychological attributes which produce con- servatism or rightism in the subject. He discovered that those who were personally maladjusted were the ones who tended to be ex- treme conservatives, by his definition. The fact that the extremists do not include the great majority of this sample of Birchers, how- ever, raises some questions concerning their identity. Because of limitations imposed by the Birch hierarchy, it was im- possible to administer a conclusive battery of psychological tests to the respondents. Since, however, McClosky is one of the major</page><page sequence="12">A PROFILE OF THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY 195 sources for such data on the far right, insights into his study might be regarded as insights into the validity of common assumptions concerning the nature of extremists. While it is apparent that Pro- fessor McClosky did indeed discover a group which tended to be psychologically unsound, it is far from clear that these persons can be identified with the political right. Despite the size of the current sample, the results are so overwhelming as to be a fair indicator that many Birch Society members do not fall into the category of extreme conservatives, a finding which in turn leads one to ques- tion whether that category has much relationship to the generally acknowledged phenomenon of political rightism. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Members of the John Birch Society, as represented by this Cali- fornia sample, differ in many ways from the usual image of the radi- cal rightist. They are for the most part, well-educated, reasonably young individuals with substantial family incomes. The men are employed in upper-status occupations, although they are rarely self-employed. This picture does not fit the prototype of an older, less well-educated person of lower-income and occupational status. The major apparent parallel is the tendency toward membership in fundamentalist religious groups. While the characterization of radical rightists as low-status indi- viduals dominates the literature, certain limited studies have voiced some dissents. Wolfinger and his associates found members of the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade to be primarily upper-status individuals in terms of education, income, and occupation.20 Grupp found his national sample of Birchers to be of similar standing.21 The explanation for these variations may lie with the methods some researchers use to discover rightists, or it may lie with the changing nature of rightism. As American society becomes increas- ingly politicized and as more people become discontented, distrust- ful, and frustrated by the political establishment, it may be that the appeals of right-wing, activist groups such as the John Birch Society are extending far beyond the narrow group which used to constitute 20 Raymond E.

Whereas the ranks of the discontented may have formerly been filled by those who could no longer cope economically, they are increasingly swelled by those who find dis- illusionment in the social, political, and moral climate of America. This sample of Birchers was remarkable not only for its rather high status but also for the surprising absence of multiple organiza- tional memberships which it exhibited. Apparently, certain indi- viduals who are basically apolitical feel so threatened by the un- certainties of their world, with its rising taxes and inflation, its civil turmoil, and its international instability, that they are goaded into this nontraditional form of activity.22 The lack of coincidence between the responses of the sample and the phenomenon identified by McClosky as extreme conservatism raises significant questions concerning the meaning of classical con- servatism. Either the scale fails effectively to operationalize con- servatism-which may indicate a lack of understanding of conserva- tism-or the Birchers are political liberals, which seems ridiculous. This latter possibility, while probably unacceptable within today's political framework, should be examined briefly. Analysts have ac- tually identified two types of conservatism, the classical position and a more popular one based on attitudes towards the transient issues of the day.23 In the second sense, the respondents certainly exhib- ited conservative tendencies. They overwhelmingly accepted the international conspiratorial theory of history espoused by Robert Welch. They opposed any expansion of governmental activity into economic or social realms; they vigorously attacked the United Na- tions and the Supreme Court as agents of collectivism. As opera- tionalized in terms of current issues, the respondents were clearly on the conservative if not radical side of the political spectrum. The problem of the Birchers' liberal responses to a scale of clas- sical conservatism is, therefore, very difficult to solve. One may wish to say that the respondents were modern conservatives but classical liberals. This statement, however, so confuses the relationship be- tween the two concepts that the author feels compelled to reject the 22 It may not be too ridiculous to suggest a parallel to the expansion on the Left, where the new leftist radicals include many members of the middle and upper classes, not the traditional working classes'. 23 McClosky himself makes the distinction. See his "Issue Conflict and Consensus Among Party Leaders and Followers," American Political Science Review, 54 (June 1960), 410.</page><page sequence="14">A PROFILE OF THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY 197 assumption that such radical variations are likely. Other explana- tions must be sought. One possibility is that McClosky's scale identifies certain economic or, even more likely, educational levels. Our sample was, on the whole, too heavily represented in both areas to fall into the extreme conservative category; those few who came close may simply have been exceptions who would have been insignificant in a larger sample. Another possible conclusion is that McClosky used terms and concepts which appealed to the respondents but stated them in such a way that most educated, intelligent individuals would feel obli- gated to disagree. Absolute assertions that something always hap- pens may have elicited negative responses even though the respond- ents fundamentally agreed with the sense of the proposition. Still another possibility, of course, is that McClosky has (or his readers have) completely misunderstood the relationship between conservatism and extreme conservatives, or radical rightists. This study could lend support to the proposition that conservatism and radicalism are separate phenomena and that a scale designed to identify conservatives says little or nothing about extremists. While problems with the size of the sample and the method of administration of the questionnaire obviously exist here, the results are so clear that they should at least suggest the need for further study. That the sample was atypical is possible but not probable. Much more research into the nature of political rightists is needed.</page></plain_text>
