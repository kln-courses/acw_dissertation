<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINS OF WAR: BIOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL THEORIES DOYNE DAWSON ABSTRACT This article surveys the history since the Enlightenment of the controversy over the origins and functions of warfare, focusing on the question of whether war is caused by nature or nurture. In the earlier literature (before 1950) five positions are distin- guished. (1) The Hobbesian thesis: war is part of human nature and serves both the internal function of solidarity and the external function of maintaining the balance of power. (2) The Rousseauean thesis: war is not in human nature but was invented by states for the functions mentioned above. (3) The Malthusian thesis: war serves the grand function of reducing population, quite apart from its conscious proximate functions. (4) The Spencerian thesis: a combination of Hobbes and Malthus-war serves the grand function of human evolution. (5) The cultural anthropologists' thesis: an extreme version of Rousseau -war is a dysfunctional historical accident. Most of the article is devoted to recent controversy, distinguishing three major theo- ries: (1) sociobiology, an updated version of the Spencerian thesis; (2) cultural ecology, an updated version of the cultural-anthropological thesis, combining Rousseau and Malthus; (3) cultural Darwinism, which holds that the process of cultural evolution mimics natural selection. The last theory is favored here. It implies that warfare has no grand functions, either sociobiological or ecological. War is neither nature nor nur- ture, but nurture imitating nature. Hobbes was right in thinking war has always been around; Rousseau was right to think primitive warfare was not the same thing as the wars of states. During the International Year of Peace 1986 an international conference of natural and social scientists at Seville University issued the Seville Statement on Violence, modeled on the UNESCO Statement on Race, and since adopted by the American Anthropological Association and other professional organiza- tions. The scholars wished to "challenge a number of alleged biological findings that have been used . . . to justify violence and war" and to affirm that "biology does not condemn humanity to war." They specifically pronounced the fol- lowing anathemas: IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that we have inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors.... IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that war or any other violent behavior is genetically programmed into our human</page><page sequence="2">2 DOYNE DAWSON nature.... IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behavior. . . ' Despite these capitalized assurances, it is doubtful that there existed in 1986 a genuine consensus on these questions in any of the disciplines concerned. Cer- tainly there was none among the general public. Soon after the publication of the Seville Statement a survey revealed that fifty percent of American college students affirmed that war is "intrinsic" in human nature.2 And since then there has been a noticeable revival, in both the academic and the popular press, of speculation that many aspects of human nature-personality, intelligence, gender differences, sexual orientation-are inherited. Clearly the debate between nature and nurture, perhaps the longest-running controversy in the history of science, is still vigorous. Its two main battlegrounds have always been warfare and gender, two closely related subjects that raise so many interesting questions about human nature that to take a scientific position on these issues is usually thought to imply a political agenda: the authors of the Seville Statement take it for granted that to say warfare is in human nature is "to justify violence and war," while to call these products of human nurture is to suggest they can and should be easily controlled. The issue is complicated by the fact that in the twentieth century it has tended to become a war of the faculties, with biologists, including many biological anthropolo- gists, on the side of nature and cultural and social anthropologists flocking to the banners of nurture. Much of it is a dismal story of inconclusive and repeti- tious rounds between passionately held half-truths. But certain recent developments in anthropological theory hold out some hope that the gap can be bridged and at least justify a fresh look at the problem. The purpose of this article is to survey current theories in the natural and social sciences about the origin and functions of war, to bring these to the attention of a wider audience -particularly historians, whose discipline is traditionally more concerned with warfare than any other but poor in theories about it - and to suggest some tentative conclusions. It seems useful to begin with a short sketch of the history of this controversy in modern Western civilization. The current debate is so polarized because of the common assumption that to accept the proposition that war has been in some way a norm of human nature must imply a second proposition, that war is necessary and justifiable. A review of the history of the controversy shows that this association of ideas, though common, is by no means so inevitable as many people think, and that the extreme politicization of the nature-nurture question is a fairly recent development. It is convenient to begin this review with the Enlightenment, before which the question hardly existed. The Enlight- enment set the terms of this debate, establishing the two contrary approaches which have been labeled ever since with the names Hobbes and Rousseau; to 1.

THE NATURE-NURTURE CONTROVERSY BEFORE THE SECOND WORLD WAR (a) The Hobbesian Thesis: War is Human Nature In early modern Europe it was widely assumed that mankind is innately warlike and has been so always, the warfare of civilized states a direct continuation of the wars of savages. This assumption we call "Hobbesian" because Hobbes formulated it with memorable force, but he only stated systematically a view- point found everywhere in the classical Greek and Latin authors, above all in his cherished Thucydides.4 "So that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, competition; second, diffidence; thirdly, glory. The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation." The three causes are from Thucydides, and there is nothing new about the assumption that war is in the nature of man. What is novel about Hobbes's analysis is his insistence that war virtually is the nature of man. The state of nature is a "State of Warre." He is the first modern thinker to analyze the function of war and develop a coherent theory about it, which I will call the balance of power theory, though the phrase was not yet invented. (I imply here none of the un-Hobbesian connotations of international order and stability found in some later balance-of-power theories, only the fundamental Hobbesian vision of a world structured by amoral power relationships.) Hobbes starts with a deterministic assumption about human nature: all people are uniformly egotistic, controlled by an animus dominandi comprising the three passions mentioned above, which puts them eternally at odds with one another. Then he adds a corollary about the nature of the human environment, or the structure of interstate politics: this kind of human nature necessarily produces a pervasive insecurity and a generalized expectation of warfare in which the only sound strategic logic is that of the preventive war, attacking potential enemies before they can attack you. And from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to secure himself so reasonable as anticipation; that is, by force or wiles to master the persons of all men he can, so long, till he see no other power great enough to endanger him; and this is no more than his own conservation requireth, and is generally allowed. 3. Among earlier attempts to sketch this history two essays by J. M. G. Van der Dennen deserve mention: "Origin and Evolution of 'Primitive' Warfare," in Sociobiology and Conflict: Evolutionary Perspectives on Competition, Cooperation, Violence and Warfare, ed. Van der Dennen and V. Falger (London, 1990), 149--188; and "Primitive War and the Ethnological Inventory Project," ibid., 247-269. Martin Ceadel's Thinking about Peace and War (Oxford, 1987) is concerned with contemporary theories but provides a useful perspective. 4. On Hobbes's debt to Thucydides (1.76) see Gabriella Slomp, "Hobbes, Thucydides, and the Three Greatest Things," History of Political Thought 11 (1990), 565-586; and L. M. Johnson, Thucydides, Hobbes, and the Interpretation of Realism (DeKalb, 1993).</page><page sequence="4">4 DOYNE DAWSON This is the approach to international relations that today is called "Realism," and Realist theorists of international relations have always acknowledged Hobbes as their spiritual father. We notice that Hobbes, like most of the later Realists, sees only an external function in warfare. His state of war-actually a state of cold war-is totally anarchic and antisocial, but it does serve the purpose of achieving gain, safety, and reputation, anticipating enemies to prevent imbalances and thereby main- taining the balance of power in one's own interest. Hobbes is rightly thought the founder of the naturalist school of warfare. He framed the big question in the form we still use-was the state of nature a state of war?-and answered it in the affirmative with a reductionist logic that, in the words of the Seville scientists, condemned humanity to war as rigorously as any later Darwinist. But it is not clear that Hobbes thought the state of nature had literally been a historical period. His analysis has the deliberate ahistoricism of most early modern theories of social contract. He makes some glancing use of ethnographic evidence: It may peradventure be thought, there was never such a time nor condition of war such as this; and I believe it was never generally so, over all the world; but there are many places where they live so now. For the savage people in many places of America . . . live at this day in that brutish manner, as I said before.5 Later writers confidently assumed the historicity of the state of war and realized that if it had been a historical period it could not have been anarchic. There had never been a "war of every man against every man" as Hobbes thought, rather a war of every society against every society. One later Hobbesian deserves special mention here. In 1767 the Scottish philosopher Adam Ferguson published an Essay on the History of Civil Society, which has been called the first attempt at an empirical investigation of the origins of war using ethno- graphic data. This data seemed to confirm Hobbes: the primitive state was indeed a state of war: "We have had occasion to observe, that in every rude state, the great business is war; and that in barbarous times, mankind, being generally divided into small parties, are engaged in almost perpetual hostili- ties."96 Ferguson's interpretation of these hostilities presages certain develop- ments in later anthropological theory. Among the Hobbesian motives for war - competition, diffidence, and glory-Ferguson assigns priority to glory. He thinks that both cannibals and kings fight for honor more than for booty or any other material interest: "Mankind not only find in their condition the sources of variance and dissension: they appear to have in their minds the seeds of animosity, and to embrace the occasions of mutual opposition, with alacrity and pleasure." The basic cause of war is simple "rivalship." And Ferguson sees positive values in it, where Hobbes had seen only a necessary evil. Ferguson points out that warfare enforces civic unity, engenders civic virtue, promotes 5. Hobbes, Leviathan [1651] (Oxford, 1958), 1.13. 6. Ferguson, Essay (reprinted New York, 1971), 3.5.</page><page sequence="5">THE ORIGINS OF WAR 5 civic organization, and in fact may be an essential condition for the very exis- tence of civilization. In addition to maintaining the balance of power, Ferguson ascribes to warfare the function of maintaining civic solidarity and morale. This idea could also be found in classical authors, especially the Romans, and many early modern writers paid tribute to it,7 but I do not know that it had ever been put so lucidly. Ferguson describes what later social Darwinists and sociobiologists would call "ethnocentricism," though it seems unlikely any of them were directly influenced by Ferguson. The idea imparts such subtlety to the Hobbesian thesis that if usage had not credited it to Hobbes we might better call it the Fergusonian thesis. To Hobbes there was only an anarchical egotism in human nature, though that made it impossible for him to explain where "glory" comes from, as this is by definition a social motivation and people living in an asocial state of nature ought not to be concerned about their reputations. In the more plausible reformulation of Ferguson, warfare serves two complementary functions, the internal function of maintaining solidarity and virtue and the external function of maintaining the balance of power. The two require each other because we cannot feel rivalship without rivals, nor will our rivalship be successful unless the word "we" carries a deep meaning for us. In-group amity depends upon out-group enmity and vice versa. (b) The Rousseauean Thesis: War is Human Nurture But the classical tradition contained an alternative view of the origins of war, best known from Ovid and Seneca: the primitive and natural state was a peaceful golden age, and warfare was one of the consequences of the rise of property and inequality.8 It was a pessimistic tradition which held out no hope for the revival of the golden age: the classical authors thought of it as a transient phase in which peace was made possible by small populations and ample resources, considered the advance of civilization a good thing on the whole, and assumed that in the world we live in warfare is as inescapable as its causes, property and inequality. Some eighteenth-century philosopher, especially Montesquieu, turned this tradition into a serious anthropological theory and made the golden age a historical epoch rather than a myth. Montesquieu's version of this theory was not that different from the Hobbesian thesis, for he shared the pessimism of his classical sources. He believed the state of nature had been a time of peace but showed little nostalgia for it. He took it for granted that the rise of civil society was an improvement and approved of "just wars," even of just con- 7. The theme that Rome began to decline after the destruction of Carthage because she had no more enemies to keep her united and virtuous is repeated by several Latin authors. A locus classicus is Sallust Bellum Iugurthinum xli.2: "metus hostilis in bonis artibus civitatem retinebat" (fear of the enemy kept the city in good character). Cf. Sallust, Bellum Catilinae vi-xiii. 8.

It meant that war must be the creation of states, not individuals or societies or peoples. It meant that war issued from politics, not from human nature. It invited those who had doubts about the benefits of the state or civil society to condemn war as an unmitigated evil. Rousseau did not hesitate to proceed to that conclusion. 0 He is rightly consid- ered the philosopher of peace, as Hobbes is the philosopher of war, for he did more than anyone else to turn the golden age tradition to the uses of pacifism. In Ovid the golden age is an etiological myth explaining - and justifying - the existence of inequality, warfare, and other injustices; in Rousseau it is a utopian model of what society should be. It is true that his pacifism remains negative and pessimistic. He did not hold out much hope for the abolition of war. His state of nature is an ideal standard not to be confused with social realities, and belief in it is a matter of faith rather than politics. In general the philosopher execrated warfare while remaining skeptical about the possibility of escaping from it. But Rousseau had encouraged such hopes, and they grew stronger toward the end of his century. Kant declared the aboli- tion of war a necessary ethical goal-in typical Kantian fashion, necessary to uphold as a moral imperative regardless of its practicality -while Bentham had no doubt that the practical implementation of the goal would follow quickly upon the adoption of utilitarian principles. Perhaps the most significant change in the climate of opinion was a growing suspicion of the ancient doctrine of preventive war (taken for granted not only by Hobbes but by Montesquieu and Ferguson) and a growing conviction that "just wars" should be limited to self-defense, which they defined in a much more restrictive way than in the past." As to the functions of war the nurturist school seems to have added little. Hobbesians were concerned with the functions of war, Rousseaueans more with the origins of war. Hobbesians asked how war is best practiced, Rous- seaueans how it is best avoided. Hobbesians try to explain the place of warfare in society; Rousseaueans want mostly to deplore it. We notice, however, that the camps of nature and nurture were not sharply polarized in the eighteenth century. One could think war natural to mankind yet an evil, and hope to limit its ravages; one could think it the artificial creation of states and yet a beneficial instrument. 9.

Gallie, Philosophers of Peace and War: Kant, Clausewitz, Marx,</page><page sequence="7">THE ORIGINS OF WAR 7 (c) The Malthusian Thesis: The Grand Function of War All the theories discussed so far assumed war has certain ends or functions and that the "function" of war is more or less identical with the "origin" of war. By "function" all meant more or less "intent": they assumed the causes of war must be conscious and deliberate. They distinguished two types of function, one aimed at external aggression and the other at internal cohesion. Most, both Hobbesians and Rousseaueans, emphasized the external function, though Ferguson thought the internal function primary. Then in 1798 Thomas Malthus suggested an entirely different approach in his Essay on Population, one which rendered the earlier controversies nugatory. Perhaps warfare has a higher function that is not intentional on the part of the human actors but is invisible to them. The function Malthus attributed to it is so high as to be called cosmic: warfare is part of the plan of God and nature to reduce excessive human population at necessary intervals. This theory too had its classical antecedents. The ancient Stoics and Renaissance neo-Stoics had speculated that warfare belongs to a providential scheme designed to keep populations from outgrowing their food supply. 2 Malthus did not speculate about the low-level or proximate functions of war because from his grand perspective they had become irrelevant. Whatever the conscious motives of the human actors they were only puppets manipulated by the transcendent laws of demography, which when population pressure reached a certain point would pull on the strings of gain and safety, honor and glory. This notion of a grand function for warfare was to become extremely influen- tial during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Because it suggested warfare is ultimately beneficial it would appeal mostly to Hobbesians, but eventually there would also be Rousseauean versions of it. Malthus directly inspired much of this speculation, but his own theory did not represent much of a departure from classical ways of thought because he saw warfare as an instrument, how- ever grim, of a rational and orderly cosmos. Like others in his century he thought of warfare as everpresent, recurring endlessly throughout history to unify this society, or extend the frontiers of that one, or correct population imbalances for all, but tending always to promote the status quo, a repetitive cycle going nowhere. Some Enlightenment historians had discerned a certain unilinear evolution in human history, usually a simple progression from one stage to the next (in Ferguson, from savagery to barbarism to civil society), and had toyed with the notion that warfare was one of the causes of this develop- Engels, and Tolstoy (Cambridge, Eng., 1978); Azar Gat, Origins of Military Thought: From the Enlightenment to Clausewitz (Oxford, 1989). 12.

The latter was the most influential neo-Stoic treatise of the Renaissance.</page><page sequence="8">8 DOYNE DAWSON ment. But it was left to nineteenth-century thinkers to formulate sweeping visions of progress, sometimes making warfare the chief instrument. (d) The Spencerian Thesis: Neo-Hobbesianism The prevalence of unilinear stage theories of anthropological development made it easy to believe that warfare was on its way out, for it could be consigned to a savage or barbarous stage of human evolution soon to be obliterated by the spread of commerce and civility. From that point of view the Hobbes-Rousseau controversy became irrelevant. Whether or not savage man had practiced war, civil man need not. Hopes for the abolition of war were rosier than ever before or since in the Utopian Socialist literature of the early nineteenth century. They soon wilted. Before the century had reached its midpoint the nature-nurture controversy was revived and assumed a central place in political theory. Following common usage, I will use the expression "social Darwinism" for all Victorian social-conflict theories based on evolutionary biology, though aware it is something of a misnomer for what might better be called "social Lamarckism" or just "Spencerism." The question of why the nineteenth century was so fascinated by this paradigm of progress-through-violent-struggle can hardly be engaged here. It long antedated Darwinism. Doubtless it owed its popularity to tapping two established trends: the cult of scientific/technical progress that spread over Europe with the railroads, and an older Romantic cult of heroic conflict that accompanied Napoleon's armies. All came together in the seductive formulas put forward by Herbert Spencer about 1850: relentless Malthusian population pressure produces recurrent competition between socie- ties, war is the ultimate arbiter and the main agent of evolution, and evolution means progress in the sense of improvement. "From the very beginning the conquest of one people over another has been, in the main, the conquest of social man over anti-social man; or, strictly speaking, of the more adapted over the less adapted.""3 He soon coined the value-laden phrase "survival of the fittest" to describe this process. In later writings he explored the several ways that warfare led to progress: it improved the species by elimination of the unfit and by selective breeding for intelligence and courage; it promoted the habits of cooperation, which made possible civilized life; and it forced the evolution of larger and more complex societies. "Everywhere the wars between societies originate governmental structures, and are causes of all such improve- ments in those structures as increase the efficiency of corporate action against environing societies. "14 Spencer is now so little read that such language may easily be taken out of context and misunderstood. He was in fact an opponent of the militarists and imperialists of his age. He retained the optimistic Enlightenment view of history as a rational unilinear progress and he was sure this progress led from the "egoistic" stage of "aboriginal man" to the "altruistic" stage of civilization. 13.

(London, 1906), I, 520.</page><page sequence="9">THE ORIGINS OF WAR 9 Progress had been triggered by warfare, but warfare had served its purpose and had become obsolete in modern society. In the long run it was the altruists who were the fittest and would survive. The publication of The Origin of Species in 1859 seemed to Spencer and others to provide striking confirmation of Spencer's theories. Quite independently of Spencer, Darwin had developed a similar theory of evolution based on Malthu- sian laws of population pressure, and had applied it to the entire biological world. Their language sounded alike. Darwin, like Spencer, frequently used military metaphors, though Darwin insisted they were only figures of speech. When Darwin borrowed from Spencer the phrase "survival of the fittest" he made it clear that he meant the struggle for survival was usually won by those who are fittest in endurance or in cooperativeness (neither necessarily for mili- tary purposes). Still, much of the struggle for existence that Darwin described was not metaphorical. He changed the popular image of primitive humanity. When Hobbes used the word "brutish" to describe the state of war, he employed a metaphor; but after Darwin to say that war is in human nature was to suggest literal connections with our animal past. These were dramatized in the 1860s by the discovery of Neanderthal man, who was usually depicted as a violent and bloodthirsty apelike brute. And in The Descent of Man (1871), Darwin explicitly suggested that warfare had been at one time an agent in human evolu- tion: We can see, that in the rudest state of society, the individuals who were the most sagacious, who invented and used the best weapons or traps, and who were best able to defend themselves, would rear the greatest number of offspring. As a tribe increases and is victorious, it is often still further increased by the absorption of other tribes. ... When two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition, if (other circumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other. Let it be borne in mind how all-important in the never-ceasing wars of savages, fidelity and courage must be."5 In this passage Darwin acknowledged his debt to the journalist Walter Bage- hot, a disciple of Spencer who has been called the first self-proclaimed social Darwinist because of his explicit attempts to link Darwinian biological evolution and Spencerian social evolution, obvious in the title of his famous work- Physics and Politics: Or Thoughts on the Application of the Principles of "Natural Selection" and "Inheritance" to Political Society (London, 1872). In spite of this title, the principles of Bagehot, like those of Spencer, were Lamarck- ian rather than Darwinian. The ease with which the Victorians linked social and biological evolution will scarcely be intelligible today if we do not bear in mind that almost everyone in that century accepted the possibility that acquired characteristics could be inherited. Even Darwin thought this possible, though of less importance than natural selection. Spencer and his followers assumed 15. Darwin, Descent of Man, 2nd ed. (London, 1874), 145-147.</page><page sequence="10">10 DOYNE DAWSON the inheritance of acquired characteristics was common, and hence all cultural evolution must be linked to biological evolution. They perceived human evolu- tion as a rapid, readily diffusible, largely purposeful Lamarckian process. Like Spencer, Bagehot assumed war had been a major agent in this process: "progress is promoted by the competitive examination of constant war." 16 Like Spencer, he emphasized that warfare succeeds not so much through the geno- cidal elimination of rivals as by promoting superior organization. The tamest are the strongest. "The compact tribes win, and the compact tribes are the tamest. Civilisation begins, because the beginning of civilisation is a military advantage."17 On the other hand, he did not seem quite so certain as Spencer that warfare had become obsolete. He wrote Physics and Politics at the end of the American Civil War, and he did not ignore its lessons. He commented with some unease on the possibility that modern industrial democracies with their mass armies might make warfare a more decisive evolutionary instrument than ever before. In late-Victorian and Edwardian times many popular versions of social Dar- winism proliferated. Many used Darwinian theory on behalf of militant nation- alism, the new imperialism, and the arms races that accelerated at the end of the nineteenth century. They did not hesitate to describe pugnacity as a programmed behavior immune to nurture, or to claim for warfare a continuing evolutionary role, sometimes carried to fantastic lengths. One cannot resist quoting the British major who wrote in 1914 that even particular military strate- gies were inherited: the counterattack came "as naturally to the British race as the crescent impi to the Zulu, the concealed stockade to the Burman, sniping and the ghazi charge to the wild Pathan, or the dense, thrusting advance by hordes to the modern German."18 After the discrediting of social Darwinism it was remembered chiefly as an ideology of the right, but this is an oversimplification. For one thing, its influence on the right has been exaggerated. Many old-fashioned imperialists and nation- alists have been called social Darwinists simply because they wrote after 1859, or at most used bits of fashionable biological jargon to render "scientific" no- tions that owed far more to Machiavelli or to Clausewitz than to Darwin. For another thing, it is often forgotten that social Darwinism affected thinkers of every political stripe in the later nineteenth century. In the words of a recent scholar, it was "translatable into almost every available idiom of political and social discourse." 19 It appealed to feminists and to patriarchalists, to Marxist 16.

The Lamarckian flexibility of the paradigm made it suitable for any purpose. The Darwinian-based war biology was countered by a Darwinian-based peace biology which emphasized the evolutionary advantages of cooperation, and at least in the English-speaking world the latter was perhaps more influential. The commoner version of peace biology, held by Darwin and Spencer and popularized at the end of the century by T. H. Huxley, was still a neo-Hobbesian thesis: they thought warfare had been an adaptive evolutionary force throughout most of human history but had become dysgenic under modern conditions, and called upon civilization to transcend the violence of nature. But there was a more radical version of peace biology, best represented by the Russian anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin, whose Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution was written in England in the 1890s in response to Huxley. Kropotkin may be described as a Rousseauean social Darwinist. He argued that primitive man, though not quite a noble savage, was naturally peaceable and cooperative, and that warfare was an artificial cultural creation promoted by states and class structures that appeared late in human history. The debate over whether warfare was, or had been, a eugenic or a dysgenic force went on for decades before the World War broke out, with much use of dubious biology by both sides. We notice how the more militant social Darwinists synthesized all the older notions about the functions of war. Most of them believed that warfare served both external functions - maintenance of the balance of power - and internal functions - promotion of social cohesion. (The latter was labeled "ethnocen- tricism" by the American social Darwinist W. G. Sumner in 1906, and the label would stick.) In addition they ascribed to warfare a Malthusian grand function much grander than Malthus's: Ares not only kept population down but pruned it; he had been the maker and breaker of nations and the agent of progress, and some thought he had not relinquished that role even in the modern world. (e) The Cultural Anthropologists' Thesis: Neo-Rousseaueanism20 Early in the twentieth century nature fell and fell hard, thanks to Mendelian genetics. By around 1900 biologists had generally accepted the doctrine that acquired characteristics could not be inherited. The immediate effect of this discovery was only to add further complications to the nature-nurture contro- versy, in fact to generate some extreme brands of biological determinism. But in the long run it undercut the main premise of social Darwinism. The social 20.

Unfortu- nately, the vigorous antiwar social Darwinism was thrown out along with war biology, and one result was to put an end to the promising start the social Darwinists had made toward developing theories of cultural evolution. The reaction against social Darwinism was led by the new university-based profession of anthropology. Through the first half of the twentieth century American anthropology was quite dominated, and all other anthropologists strongly influenced, by the cultural determinist school of Franz Boas and his disciples, especially Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict, who set their faces against anything remotely suggestive of hereditary influences on culture. They conceived "culture" as a superorganic entity with enormous power to shape the minds of individuals, who seemed to have no feedback into it whatever. In some extreme formulations of this view human nature was made to seem a blank slate on which anything at all might be written. The cultural determinists were highly skeptical about so-called laws of be- havior which might limit the power and autonomy of culture, and therefore scarcely admitted the existence of regular "functions" in the sense in which I have used that word. They especially did not believe that warfare performed any regular functions either proximate or grand. They tended to describe warfare (if they did at all, for mostly they preferred to ignore it, which is why 1 have not attempted to identify this thesis with any one author) as a relatively superficial adaptation or maladaptation, with the implication that it might easily be got rid of. Margaret Mead made this explicit in a 1940 essay entitled "War is Only an Invention-Not a Biological Necessity" in which she argued that warfare is a "historical accident" persisted in (apparently) from force of habit. She admitted that primitive warfare served a variety of purposes, but to her that seemed to establish its superficiality. It might "accumulate prestige or avenge their honor or acquire loot or wives or slaves or sago lands or cattle or appease the blood lust of their gods or the restless souls of the newly dead."21 And she saw no pattern in any of that. Much the same assumptions underlie the 1986 Seville Statement on Violence. War had no real functions, nor did it have an evolution. Anthropology had begun as an evolutionary science, but in the nineteenth century its theories of social evolution had never gone much beyond the unilinear stages in which humans march lock-step from savagery to barbarism to civilization. Now evolu- tion became a suspect term because of its associations with social Darwinism. Anthropology, once almost confused with biology, parted company with it abruptly, and the link between organic and social evolution was snapped. This still left open the possibility of a theory of superorganic cultural evolution, but the cultural determinists were too suspicious of grand theories to produce one. 21.

Anthro- pology had by now come to the seminal realization that much primitive warfare is very different from the kind of warfare practiced by civilized societies. In 1941 Bronislaw Malinowski published "An Anthropological Analysis of War," arguing that primitive war was so different from modern war that it was hardly the same institution." The most primitive type of warfare he described as a "juridical mechanism" without economic or political purpose. During the 1940s, a decade that for obvious reasons saw renewed interest in the origins of war, this view became something of an orthodoxy among social scientists. In 1942 Quincy Wright brought out his massive A Study of War (2nd ed., Chicago, 1965), in which he concluded that four percent of primitive people fought wars only in self-defense, and fifty-nine percent for what he called "social" reasons (revenge, prestige, sport, ritual), but only thirty-seven percent for economic or political motives; the last group included the more advanced societies. On the basis of this data Joseph Schneider argued that on the most primitive level warfare is "a matter of crime and punishment within populations where systems of public justice are undeveloped. That is not war." 23 This amounted to an ingenious new twist upon Rousseaueanism. One was needed. Enough reliable ethnographic data had been accumulated to make it difficult to believe that primitive peoples are inherently peaceful. The major anthropological studies on warfare produced in the early twentieth century, M. R. Davie's The Evolution of War: A Study of Its Role in Early Societies (London, 1929)-one of the last products of social Darwinism-and Wright's Study of War, both supported Hobbes on this question. Still, one might retort that primitives practiced an innocuous sort of conflict that was not really war. What Wright meant by "social" warfare was close to what Hobbes and Ferguson meant by "glory." But of course Hobbes and Ferguson never thought of glory as an innocuous motive. Modern anthropologists tended to trivialize the motives of honor and glory, making them sound like a mere "juridical mechanism," forgetting that ethnocentric solidarity is in the deepest interest of any social group, probably as important as any economic or political advantage. One could think of primitive war as utterly different from the wars of advanced societies only if one ignored the internal functions of warfare. Anthropologists continued to ignore the problem of the evolution of war, though the distinction between primitive and complex warfare seems to raise at once the question of how the second developed out of the first. This question was forcefully posed by H. H. Turney-High in 1949 in Primitive War: Its Practices and Concepts (2nd ed., Columbia, S.C., 1971). But apart from such dissenters as Turney-High, the new Rousseau, as late as around 1950, seemed victorious over the new Hobbes. 22.

THE NATURE-NURTURE CONTROVERSY SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR (a) The Sociobiological Thesis The vision of nature red in tooth and claw would never quite go away. The founders of modern psychology did not think the human mind a blank slate and did not support the view that human culture is infinitely malleable. In his essay "The Moral Equivalent of War," written in the militaristic climate of 1910, William James concluded that "The war-party is assuredly right in affirming and reaffirming that the martial virtues, although originally gained by the race through war, are absolute and permanent human goods. Patriotic pride and ambition in their military form are, after all, only specifications of a more general competitive passion." The only hope for peace lay in redirecting this passion into other channels.24 In the even bleaker climate of 1932 Sigmund Freud wrote to Albert Einstein that war is rooted in a "death instinct," a "lust for aggression and destruction," arising from "a good biological basis."25 Earlier, in Totem and Taboo (1913), Freud had presented a fanciful anthropological theory of the origins of group aggression, which was never taken seriously by anthropologists, but which foreshadowed certain features of later sociobiological theory in linking warfare to primitive family structures and sex roles. Psychologists in Freud's time might speak of a biological basis for warfare, but they received no support from biology. Darwinism as a social and political theory was in eclipse in the West between the World Wars. Not until after World War II did new advances in biology unexpectedly revive the nature-nurture controversy. In quick succes- sion, two major offensives opened on behalf of fallen nature: the "ethologists" of the 1960s and the "sociobiologists" of the 1970s. At the time Freud wrote to Einstein, another Viennese scientist, the young Konrad Lorenz, was conducting research on the social behavior of jackdaws. This developed into the new field of "ethology" or animal behavior. In the 1960s a series of popular books disseminated its findings among a wide audience.26 All tried to establish connections between warfare and aggressive animal instincts and to suggest a genetic basis for warfare, drawing support from the discovery of apparently predatory hominid ancestors in Africa. Ever since Hobbes popu- larized the word "brutish," naturalists had assumed human warfare was linked to the animal world, whether they understood this as a metaphor like the original Hobbesians, or, like the social Darwinists, as a literal biological inheritance. The connection seemed self-explanatory, until the collapse of social Darwinist theory in the early twentieth century. After that some explanation of the connec- 24.

This is what the new ethological school provided. Its main thesis was summed up in the title of an article published in 1953 by Raymond Dart, the discoverer of Australopithecus: "The Predatory Transition from Ape to Man."27 They placed a new importance upon the fact of predation, drawing attention for the first time to the significance of hunting in early human societies. Aristotle (Politics 1.8) had suggested that warfare originated as an offshoot of hunting, but later writers paid little attention to this idea. Since the eighteenth century anthropologists had generally believed that hunting was everywhere the primal stage of human society. After Darwin, it was understood that early man had differed from all other primates in being a hunter. The discovery of Australopithecus, which Dart believed had been a big-game hunter, seemed to push the hunting culture back millions of years into the past. Finally, in the writings of the ethologists there emerged full-blown what we may call the "hunting hypothesis." Hunting was assumed to play a formative role in hominid evolution because of the premium it placed on intelligent cooperation. Warfare, the hunting of men, was an obvious adaptation of the beast-hunt. Hunting and warfare, both almost exclusively male activities in primitive groups, were explained as products of the sexual division of labor and associated with the ubiquitous human social patterns of male bonding and male supremacy. The male tendency to bond with other males for hunting and war was assumed to have an instinctual base.28 The ingenuity of this solution lay in stressing the differences, rather than the similarities, between human and animal aggression. The ethologists understood that what needs explanation is the unique humanness of warfare. Other animals do not make war. Predation is not war and not really aggression. Cougars do not hate deer any more than fishermen hate trout. Predatory animals are not particularly aggressive toward members of their own species, indeed less so than many herbivores like bulls and stags. How was it that human predation could be so easily turned against other humans? The ethologists thought this adaptation a by-product of the transition from peaceful vegetarian apes to hominid killers, who lacked the real carnivores' instinctive inhibitions against intraspecific violence, and were made even more bloodthirsty by the distancing effect of artificial weapons. The evolution of war was made to seem not so much a continuation as a perversion of our animal heritage. Man was more brutish than the brutes. In retrospect it is not hard to spot the merits and limitations of the ethological school. It drew attention to major problems long neglected by orthodox anthro- 27.

Lee and Irven De Vore (Chicago, 1968).

The image of the "killer ape" has been blurred by later research, but the hunting hypothesis remains a seductive theory with which any account of human evolution must come to terms. On the other hand, there were major weaknesses in ethology. The ethologists' notion of "instinct," though an improvement over the social Darwinists' faith in Lamarckian inheri- tance of acquired traits, remained extremely vague. They generally disavowed biological determinism: they recognized the importance of culture and denied war is inevitable, usually falling back on the Jamesian strategy of finding other outlets for aggressive instincts; they thought the instincts of war could not operate without certain environmental triggers. But their metaphors did suggest that aggression is some kind of continual or intermittent drive that presses for discharge, and they could not explain what triggers or contains it. Their theories accounted for the ubiquity of warfare, but not for its equally obvious con- tingency. A second major weakness was their inability to account for altruism. Even the social Darwinists had been divided on the question of whether warfare was eugenic or dysgenic. After the rise of modern genetics and the overthrow of Lamarckism, it became difficult to explain how such an obviously dysgenic pattern of behavior as warfare could evolve. In the struggle for survival, selfish individuals should have such a clear advantage over self-sacrificing individuals that altruistic behavior ought not to exist; and warfare, which kills off the ablest young males before they have had much chance to reproduce, was one of the hardest forms of altruism to explain. The solution emerged in the 1960s, when evolutionary biology was trans- formed by a series of new theories, especially the notion of "inclusive fitness." In brief, this means that "survival of the fittest" applies not only to the personal fitness of individuals (as in classical Darwinism) but also to the fitness of their close relatives. Darwin himself had flirted with the possibility of group selection but could not explain its operations. The neo-Darwinist synthesis of the 1960s explained it in terms of "kin selection." An individual need not ensure his own survival and reproduction so long as he secures the survival and reproduction of his kindred. Genes may be passed on either by parentage or by "nepotism," the protection of kindred. Nepotistic traits may be highly adaptive for the genotype even if- especially if- they lead the individual to sacrifice himself for his clan. This theory appeared to solve the old problem of the evolution of altruism, and made it possible to theorize in Darwinian terms about the evolution of social behavior. One social behavior particularly illuminated by the new synthesis was warfare. Now it became easy to explain how warfare could systematically kill off the best and yet be eugenic. Young men who die in war have enhanced the survival chances of their kin group. A number of ancient notions about the functions of war now fell into place. In the 1 970s there emerged a new field of biology attempting to apply neo-Darwinist theory to animal (including human) social behavior. It might have called itself</page><page sequence="17">THE ORIGINS OF WAR 17 neo-social-Darwinism, but its creators preferred to distance themselves from their social Darwinist predecessors, who were now remembered chiefly as tools of reaction, and settled upon the more politic label "sociobiology," a word popularized by Edward Wilson. His Sociobiology (Cambridge, Mass., 1975) contained only a few pages at the end about specifically human evolution, as did Darwin's Origin of Species, and aroused an almost comparable storm of controversy. Wilson quickly followed it up with On Human Nature (Cambridge, Mass., 1978), his equivalent of Darwin's Descent of Man. In both treatments the evolutionary problem of the origin and function of warfare looms large. In brief, Wilson combined two ancient notions about the function of war - the internal or civic function, and the external or balance of power function- and tried to account for them in terms of kin selection, which had the effect of merging these proximate functions into an evolutionary grand function. Though he avoided the association, it amounted to a genuine and thorough revival of social Darwinism, in fact the first real social Darwinism, its Victorian predecessor being more aptly called a sort of social Lamarckism. The civic function of warfare, called "ethnocentricity" by social Darwinists, occupied a central place in Wilson's system. He argued that every human group has a natural tendency to close its ranks against outsiders and display hostility to them, thereby cementing the loyalties of the group and deflecting aggression away from it; and that this ethnocentric, xenophobic tendency has a genetic base, which has evolved through kin selection. To recapitulate the total argument, human aggression cannot be explained as either a dark-angelic flaw or a bestial instinct. Nor is it the pathological symptom of upbringing in a cruel environment. Human beings are strongly predisposed to respond with unrea- soning hatred to external threats and to escalate their hostility sufficiently to overwhelm the sources of the threat by a respectably wide margin of safety. Our brains do appear to be programmed to the following extent: we are inclined to partition other people into friends and aliens, in the same sense that birds are inclined to learn territorial songs and to navigate by the polar constellations. We tend to fear deeply the actions of strangers and to solve conflicts by aggression. These learning rules are most likely to have evolved during the past hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution and, thus, to have conferred a biological advantage on those who conformed to them with the greatest fidelity. 29 Wilson's synthesis lent new weight to the hunting hypothesis, because it was no longer necessary to connect hunting behavior with some vague "killer instinct." Hunting and warfare now seemed more the products of in-group amity than out-group enmity, for they promoted male bonding, aggressive male leadership, and social cohesion. But Wilson and his followers also emphasized the external functions of war- fare. Like Hobbes, they assumed the seeds of warfare are in human nature but have to be triggered by certain environmental forces, especially competition for resources and the need for a margin of safety. Richard Alexander (Dar- winism and Human Affairs, 1979) called this external function the balance 29. On Human Nature, 119.</page><page sequence="18">18 DOYNE DAWSON of power, a phrase normally used to describe modern international relations, thereby suggesting that the familiar Machiavellian game of Realpolitik has deep roots in human nature. Alexander argued that warfare must have had a long period of preadaptation: hominids first formed small bands for defense against predators; then increasingly turned to the hunting of game; then at some point the primary purpose of group organization became defense against other hom- inid bands. At the last stage escalation of warfare became necessary to achieve a margin of safety, setting up the self-perpetuating chain reaction known as the balance of power. Alexander revived Herbert Spencer's notion that warfare explains why large groups are advantageous and why human groups have tended to increase in size throughout history. The sociobiological school thus absorbed all the earlier versions of Hobbes- ianism with many new subtleties. They rejected the Freudian/Lorenzian idea of a unitary aggressive instinct. Even more than the ethologists they emphasized the humanness, not the animality, of warfare. The ethnocentric pattern clearly required a degree of cognitive ability sufficient to distinguish "us" from "them" - to ponder the significance of the Other, to decide to eliminate him. They stressed the cooperative aspects of warfare. To paraphrase Clausewitz, they made war sound like an extension of kinship by other means. Herbert Spencer had thought warfare an evolutionary strategy fit only for the egoistic stage of humanity, which is to become obsolete as we evolve toward altruism; but the sociobiologists thought warfare a successful evolutionary strategy precisely because it had always been a supreme expression of altruism. Different varieties of sociobiology appeared in the fast-proliferating literature on the subject.30 There was a "hard" sociobiology that did not hesitate to speak of causation by genetic selection in terms that sounded like genetic determinism, as though (to borrow one of the computer metaphors they favored) there is hardware in the human mind that specifies the software. More common was the "soft" sociobiology of Wilson and Alexander, who preferred to say that the genotype has only a probabilistic influence, setting limits on the evolution of culture and biasing it toward certain programs. The soft sociobiologists knew that the differences between cultures must be overwhelmingly the result of cultural selection, not natural selection. They thought warfare had ceased to be adaptive. Nevertheless, even soft sociobiologists thought general cultural practices must be generally adaptive in the Darwinian sense, and that warfare too, for a long time, must have been adaptive. Wilson suggested warfare might have continued to serve this adaptive function well into historic times: 30. It has gone on proliferating at a rate that makes it impossible to list here even an adequate sample of the literature. The core works of soft sociobiology are those of Wilson and Alexander, and as an example of harder sociobiology one may mention David Barash, The Whispering Within (New York, 1979). The following collections of articles will provide some guide: The Sociobiological Debate, ed. A. L. Caplan (New York, 1978); Sociobiology Examined, ed. Ashley Montagu (Oxford, 1980); Sociobiology, Beyond Nature/Nurture?, ed. G. W. Barlow and James Silverberg (Boulder, 1980); The Sociobiological Imagination, ed. Mary Maxwell (Albany, 1991); and the collection edited by Van der Dennen and Falger (see note 3 above), which is particularly relevant here.</page><page sequence="19">THE ORIGINS OF WAR 19 By current theory, genocide or genosorption strongly favoring the aggressor need take place only once every few generations to direct evolution. This alone could push truly altruistic genes to a high frequency within the bands. . . . The turnover of tribes and chiefdoms estimated from atlases of early European and Mideastern history [referring to The Penguin Atlas of Ancient History, Baltimore, 1967] suggests a sufficient magni- tude of differential group fitness to have achieved this effect.3' Wilson's synthesis immediately raised a storm of protest. In spite of the sociobi- ologists' disclaimers of political implications and of determinism, many left- wing intellectuals assumed that sociobiology was reviving all the reactionary tendencies of social Darwinism. To explain away the prevalence of war some critics fell back upon Rousseauean pieties: wars are caused by states and not by peoples; or if there was a primitive, pre-state warfare, it was a harmless institution and not really war.32 The nature-nurture controversy may have reached its nadir at a 1978 meeting of the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Science when demonstrators affiliated with the International Committee against Racism threw a pitcher of water over the speaker, Edward Wilson, chanting "Wilson, you're all wet."33 Many distinguished scientists, such as Wilson's Harvard colleague Stephen Jay Gould, from the start kept up a formidable critique of the more grandiose claims of sociobiology which was quite disassociated from these antics. This controversy is far from over, but it does not appear that sociobiology has won the field. It has by no means convinced all biologists; nor most cultural anthropologists.34 Sociobiology has not absorbed social science, let alone history, and it seems likely that they will escape its "imperialism." Two objections to the sociobiological thesis seem especially cogent. First, Wilson and his followers did not fully account for the element of historical accident in evolution. Wilson did acknowledge that factor: The cultural evolution of aggression appears to be guided jointly by the following three forces: (1) genetic predisposition toward learning some form of communal aggression; (2) the necessities imposed by the environment in which the society finds itself; and (3) 31. Wilson, Sociobiology, 573-574. 32. "It is a reflection of the reductionist program of sociobiology that organized political aggres- sion is seen as the collective manifestation of aggressive feelings of individuals. . . Yet warfare among state-organized societies has little to do with prior feelings of aggression. War is a calculated political phenomenon undertaken at the behest of those in power in a society for political and economic gain" -from Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature, ed. R. C. Lew- ontin, S. P. R. Rose, and L. J. Kamin (New York, 1984), 250-25 1. "Much of the sociobiological literature is marked by a general approach to human behavior that can easily be used to support harmful views," Philip Kitcher, Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature (Cambridge, Mass., 1985). The assumption that arguments not consonant with the authors' ideology ("harmful views") should be evaluated by a different standard of evidence seems philosophically questionable; and in any case his assumption that Darwinian arguments have always been socially reactionary is historically questionable. 33.

Recent biological discoveries have tended to magnify the accidental element in the evolutionary process, both in anatomy and in behavior. To quote Stephen Jay Gould: the standard misapplication of evolutionary theory assumes that biological explanation may be equated with devising accounts, often speculative and conjectural in practice, about the adaptive value of any given feature in its original environment (human aggres- sion as good for hunting, music and religion as good for tribal cohesion, for example). Darwin himself strongly emphasized the multifactorial nature of evolutionary change. . . . Natural selection is not fully sufficient to explain evolutionary change . . . many other causes are powerful, particularly at levels of biological organization both above and below the traditional Darwinian focus on organisms and their struggles for reproduc- tive success.36 He suggests that biologists in general, and sociobiologists in particular, tend to assume practices are adaptive simply because they have been around a long time and invent "Just So" stories to make them seem adaptive and functional. Second, the evolution of warfare raises a special sort of problem, which we may call the boundary question. Inclusive fitness works only within a small group of closely related organisms. Yet warfare, according to the balance of power theory, automatically makes groups increase in size. Therefore warfare should rapidly promote a level of group size that no longer promotes inclusive fitness. Sociobiologists have recognized this difficulty and have got around it by supposing that warfare promoted inclusive fitness only in small "nuclear ethnic groups.""' When these groups reach a certain size, culture takes over from biology. The original nepotistic kinship system turns into a system of reciprocal altruism in which the individual exchanges benefits with society at large and not just with his biological kin. Culture does this so easily because it taps the genetic predisposition to ethnocentricity, turning the original and innate group-identification into a learned anthropomorphic symbol. The terms "altruism" and "nepotism," which are only metaphors in biological usage, now assume their ordinary human meaning. This seems plausible enough, but there is also the fact that the most primitive human groups known to us follow a nomadic pattern called "fission and fusion": they wander about in small open groups that constantly split and merge, a process that makes it difficult to say what the "nuclear ethnic group" is, and who benefits from inclusive fitness. 35.

But before we turn to this alternative, let us consider a rival grand functionalism that has arisen in recent decades. (b) The Ecological Thesis In the 1970s, while sociobiology was capturing public attention, cultural anthro- pologists were quietly developing their own grand-functionalist theory of war- fare, often described as cultural ecology.38 Marvin Harris is perhaps its best- known exponent. In brief, he and his colleagues suggest that primitive warfare is a mechanism for population redistribution: it corrects environmental imbal- ances by scattering population over a wider area, thereby reducing pressure on the land and at the same time creating buffer zones that serve as game sanctu- aries. Some have gone further, suggesting that warfare not only redistributes population but reduces it, not by killing off young men (whose fertility is almost irrelevant demographically in a polygynous society) but by killing girl babies. We are told that militaristic societies prefer to raise warriors and therefore have high rates of female infanticide.39 The materialist assumptions of the cultural ecologists resemble Marxism in some ways, but they generally play down that connection. Their materialism, which owes more to archeology than to Marx, is not dialectical: they do not suggest that evolution moves in any predictable direction. They have stronger 38. Anthropological studies of warfare, a once-neglected subject, have proliferated in the last thirty years, as witness the titles listed in The Anthropology of War: A Bibliography, ed. R. B.

They may perhaps be described as cultural determinists who want to restore the evolutionary perspective that generally dropped out of anthropology around the turn of the century. They think of culture as a behavioral pattern whose evolution is shaped by adaptation to the environment; and they have seized upon the concept of an evolutionary grand function, heretofore associated with biological determinism rather than cultural. Like social Darwinists and sociobiologists they speak of warfare as a major instrument of evolution, but they mean cultural evolution rather than biological: selection of norms and practices, not genes. A blind force called culture plays at random upon varia- tions in human norms and practices in just the same way that the blind force of nature, in Darwinian theory, plays upon genetic variations. They suggest warfare can be compared to the agonistic territorial displays found in some other animal species, which appear to function so as to ensure optimal population dispersal; and that this may account for the worldwide distribution achieved by Homo sapiens even in the Paleolithic era. Cultural ecology may also be described as a new version of Rousseaueanism. Anthropologists had already bought the notion that primitive warfare was not " real" war. The ecologists went further and declared primitive warfare to be a beneficial institution, not only for the human race but for the whole natural world. Theirs is a pacifistic evolutionism: the dominant metaphor is not survival of the fittest but maintenance of an equilibrium; the main implicit value is not progress but stability. The theory allows them to admit the universality of war without endorsing modern warfare because modern war can serve none of these beneficial ecological functions and seems wholly dysfunctional. This theory has been called the dominant paradigm for explaining primitive war among cultural anthropologists for the past twenty-five years. But by no means all anthropolo- gists have accepted it and it has drawn many cogent critiques. The following objections seem particularly persuasive. Ecofunctionalism is open to the same objections that have been brought against sociobiology.40 These authors tend to discount the element of historical accident in evolution and they neglect the boundary question. It is meaningless to speak of "functions" unless we are clear about who and what they are func- tional for. Both ecological and sociobiological functionalists write about "socie- ties" as if these were unambiguously definable in extent. But in fact the bound- aries of primitive groups are notoriously fuzzy. Warfare must always benefit somebody, so if we keep shifting focus it is easy to claim warfare is good for society. Cultural ecology raises also some special problems. There is the old problem surrounding the fundamental premise of cultural determinism, to which the 40.

The ecologists reify culture as thoroughly as Margaret Mead, speaking of it as an independent variable that is somehow superorganic. In addition they seem to reify ecology. They speak of ecosystems having "needs." They speak of these evolutionary forces pulling the strings of human puppets - the warriors who believe they fight for pigs or honor or something - but receiving no input from the puppets. The basic theoretical problem is more serious than in the case of sociobiology because there is a body of generally accepted Darwinian theory that makes sociobiology at least theoretically plausible; but there is no such theory behind cultural determinism, and it is difficult to imagine just how ecosystems express their needs and how cultures respond to these. It is easy to see how primitive warfare might sometimes have beneficial environmental effects; it is not clear how they could amount to a cause of primitive warfare. Finally, how could warfare always be good for the environment? All admit that warfare is a self-escalating process. Therefore once the militaristic pattern gets started it will continue of its own momentum, and will tend to go on until it has reduced population far below the carrying capacity of the land. Survival of the biologically fittest is one thing; survival of the ecologically balanced is rather harder to accept. It is admitted that the meager existing data do not support it: there does not seem to be any clear correlation between warfare and overpopulation in those primitive cultural areas that have been studied.4' (c) A Proposed Solution: Cultural Darwinism Neither of the two grand-functionalist theories has a compelling case. But to- gether they have drawn attention to the fact that the processes of cultural evolution bear a curious resemblance to those of biological evolution. Certain recent developments in anthropological theory may help to explain this. There is a growing consensus among cultural anthropologists (outside the materialist school described above) upon an ideational concept of culture.42 They speak of culture as primarily a system of public symbolism or pool of shared information, distinct from social behavior. This definition is more pre- cise than the older notions of culture, which did not clearly distinguish ideas from behavior, and may make it easier to develop models of cultural evolution as distinct from biological evolution. It avoids also the tendencies toward a vague reification of culture that fill older anthropological literature. According to the new consensus, culture is indeed autonomous, but it is an autonomous code of information that receives constant input from individuals who are continually reprogramming it. The theory of cultural evolution has not yet found its Darwin. Evolutionary anthropology is approximately where evolutionary biology was before the Or- igin of Species. Yet many anthropologists now apply Darwinian terms and concepts to purely cultural change, without any sociobiological implications. It seems obvious that there exists a system of cultural selection that mimics 41. Vayda, War in Ecological Perspective, 38ff. 42. See n. 20 above.</page><page sequence="24">24 DOYNE DAWSON natural selection, only in a rapid Lamarckian fashion that is largely conscious and deliberate on the part of the actors. Why are individuals constantly changing the public code? Surely in large part to enhance what biologists call their inclu- sive fitness. All sociobiologists have recognized that human society must evolve by a dual inheritance system in which genes and culture interact. But if cultural inheritance does everything that genetic inheritance does, why is it necessary to bring in the genes at all? If "genetic" is shorthand for "resulting from genetic variation" then all culture has a genetic basis, because the human capacity for culture is itself a product of natural selection. It is natural selection that has made cultural selection imitate it. But that means that at some point culture has taken over. As Eibl-Eibesfeldt said, "biological development and cultural development obey the same functional laws, and . . . to a certain extent cultural evolution thus repeats biological evolution at a higher level of the developmental spiral."43 Actually the "soft" sociobiologists admit that at the higher levels of the spiral nurture has largely escaped from nature, but they think nature still holds it on a leash: natural selection continues to act upon cultural selection to maximize inclusive fitness. But they do not seem to take account of the sheer speed of cultural evolution, which must make it easy to outrun its master. How long is this leash? A leash a hundred miles long ceases to be a leash for all practical purposes. These considerations make it unnecessary and improbable to assume a genetic base for particular cultural adaptations. They also make the question seem unimportant. It remains possible that there exists some hereditary tendency toward ethnocentricism, in-group amity and out-group enmity, in human na- ture. But if so it is easily controlled and manipulated. It does not condemn us to either war or peace unless we decide to go in one of those directions. This theory I have called "cultural Darwinism." It has also been called "evolu- tionary anthropology," "biocultural anthropology," "Darwinian cultural theory," "the new sociobiology."'44 It means that the primary means of cultural evolution is the rapid, collective, sometimes rational and calculating diffusion of norms and values for the promotion of inclusive fitness. The theory does not suggest that all cultural change is adaptive in this Darwinian sense. Much change is purely accidental, the analogue of genetic drift and genetic mutation. Much of it, especially in complex societies, is coercively imposed by authorities and is maladaptive from the point of view of most of the population. Much of it is the result of cultural lag, the persistence from force of habit in practices that were once successful adaptations but are so no longer. Still, a great deal 43.

Human behavior, in short, is neither nature nor nurture. It is mostly nurture imitating nature. In the case of a phenomenon as pervasive as warfare we must assume the behavioral pattern was at one time generally adaptive. Why then was it selected? Here we run again into the debate over materialistic versus "social" motives. Do primitive peoples fight for gain or for glory? Some anthropologists, among them Eibl-Eibesfeldt and W. H. Durham, think the primary motive behind primitive warfare is competition for food resources. Durham argued that the Munducuru headhunters of Brazil, though they deny that they ever fight for land, and think of themselves as fighting to collect heads (that is, for honor and glory), really fight to eliminate competitors for their main food resource, which is the peccary. He also argued that this motive is partly conscious: they express it symbolically, in their own terms, by saying that a warrior who acquires enemy heads has pleased the spirit of the peccary. He suggests, in other words, that primitive warfare may have a provi- mate materialistic and environmental function that is intentional on the part of the warriors, though not the grand function proposed by some cultural ecologists.45 Napoleon Chagnon, on the other hand, has argued that the main motive is reproductive success, pointing out that among the Yanomamo Indians of Venezuela whom he has long studied, successful warriors tend to have more progeny and to build up larger kin networks.46 It seems possible to combine these interpretations. Aggression brings access to resources, of all kinds, and the kind of resource most in demand will depend on circumstances. Hobbes thought men fought wars to "make themselves mas- ters of other men's persons, wives, children and cattle"-mastery is key, not what one is master of. One of the most valuable insights produced by the new anthropology of war is the extent to which primitive warfare tends to fall into a multiphase pattern, starting as a ritualistic duel with few casualties, and, if not settled by arbitration, gradually escalating into more serious battles with hand-to-hand weapons and sometimes into murderous raids and ambushes. The motives can change from one stage to the next. The usual proximate motives are those described by Adam Ferguson - honor and glory. But there is probably always some awareness of the possibility of gaining material resources. Among these material resources it is probably misleading to make clear distinctions between food and females, or between territorial and non-territorial wars. Terri- tory contains both food and females, and most primitives do not appear to fight to take or defend territory so much as to reduce their competition. Their 45.

The solidarity of the primitive group and the ritualization of its war patterns would prevent clear separation of these interests. The new approach confirms both Hobbes and Rousseau. The primitive condi- tion was indeed a state of war. Human societies were prone to competition and hostility, because cultural selection diffused these traits. But Rousseau was right to emphasize the gulf between this type of competition and the "real" wars of the state system. Any general theory about the origins and functions of warfare must accept both its ubiquity and its flexibility; the theory need not be cast in terms of the old nature-nurture controversy. A cultural Darwinism, open to the fact that cultures evolve by adaptation, may be the most useful intellectual framework now available to address the problem of the origins of war. This is not, of course, the place to develop such a theory.47 But some observations about the problem may be offered. (d) The Evolution of Watfare We know far less about prehistoric warfare, especially its prevalence, than one would think from reading many military histories, which leave the impression that primitive tribes are almost constantly at war. But the fact is we know practically nothing about the war habits of the vast majority of primitive peoples even in recent times.48 Several considerations prevent us from supposing that early Paleolithic war- fare was very common or very serious: the puny manpower resources (recent hunter-gatherer bands have an average size of forty), the probably frequent intermarriages and fissionings and fusions, and above all their thin distribution. All theories of primitive warfare have recognized that whether or not it is "innate" it has to be triggered by competition. Warfare may have helped to account for the wide dispersal of early Paleolithic humanity, but at the same time it would have limited the possibilities for effective competition. When did the escalation of warfare begin? One possible turning point was the rise of the Upper Paleolithic hunting culture some thirty-five thousand years ago, now recognized as a breakthrough in social evolution perhaps as significant as the better-known Neolithic revolution.49 By that point a fully modern type of human (H. s. sapiens) had occupied all Africa and Eurasia and would soon fill up Australia and the Americas. He was armed with formidable stone-headed spears, hunted the biggest game, and could have hunted men if he chose. Often he had little choice, for bands could no longer easily avoid their neighbors by moving away from them. Population density would have brought increased 47.

It may have been around this time that primitive warfare and primitive militarism became common features of human society. A second turning point surely came at the dawn of Neolithic culture, begin- ning in the Middle East some ten thousand years ago: fixed settlements depen- dent on agriculture, with concentrated and vulnerable food supplies and a population density many times that of the Paleolithic. Population growth would have multiplied opportunities for competition while making manpower a more expendable resource. Archeological evidence leaves no doubt that warfare of an often lethal intensity was common among Neolithic communities the world over. It was probably in Upper Paleolithic or Neolithic times that primitive warfare intensified into a permanent balance of power or Hobbesian state of war, self- perpetuating and self-escalating. But until the rise of the state the escalatory pressures seem to have been contained. If the process of escalation had been inexorable, the Stone Age could not have lasted as long as it did, nor the state taken so long to rise. For as long as the Neolithic era lasted the option of migration was often open, and communities might escape the pressures of warfare and militarism by moving away from undesirable neighbors. The his- tory of prehistoric warfare, if such a thing were possible to write, would prob- ably be cyclical rather than linear. The breakthrough to the political wars of history probably began in the later Neolithic period with the rise of organized chiefdoms or ranked societies capable of conquest, but the process did not become inexorable until the rise of civilized bureaucratic states some five thousand years ago. In these early states and empires warfare still served the function of solidarity, but now to avenge offenses against a theocratic monarch rather than against the community; and its priori- ties shifted, for the major functions of war were now economic ("gain") and political ("safety") rather than social ("glory"50). The political balance of power has not followed any clear line of evolution either. Just as a tribe might occasion- ally strike a bonanza in the game of primitive warfare, sometimes a state might do the same, given the opportunities offered an Alexander the Great or a Hernain Cortes. But the historical pattern of warfare remains inconclusive, frustrating, endlessly cyclical. States persist in warfare because the mechanics of the balance of power rarely permit escape from it. If these conclusions are correct, we should amend the Seville Statement. There has been in the course of human evolution a selection for aggressive behavior, not a biological selection but a cultural and political selection. Biology has not condemned us to war, but it is possible culture and politics may do so. Or they may not. The wars of culture could be limited by escape. Primitive 50.

And the wars of politics can be limited by diplomacy. All theorists of raison d'eitat, from Thucydides to Clausewitz, assume that there is no permanent escape from warfare; but raison d'Jtat implies that states must use reason, and can bring warfare under such degree of control as they see to be in their clear interest.
