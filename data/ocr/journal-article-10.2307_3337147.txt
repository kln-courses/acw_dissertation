<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAK'ART 92 Where Internationalism Falls Apart On December 14,1992, approximately 300 crit- ics, artists, gallery owners, and art lovers from Africa, Europe, Asia, and the United States arrived in Dakar, Senegal. This city of culture, well remembered for its 1966 Festival of Negro Arts and for the successful Biennale des Lettres in 1990, was now to play host to what promised to be the most important and recent international fair dedicated to contemporary African visual arts. An unexpected rainstorm raged over the city. President Diouf, sheltered by a panoply of umbrellas and cameras, offi- cially inaugurated the Biennale des Arts, known informally as Dak'Art 92, at the Theatre Daniel Sorano and opened the exhibi- tion at the newly constructed pavilion on the grounds of the IFAN on the Place Soweto. Built by the North Koreans as a gift to the Biennale des Arts, this brash exhibition space replete with hundreds of spotlights and shiny white marble floors provided the necessary prestige to the official overview of painting and sculpture from Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy, Canada, the U.S., Martinique, Mauritius, and a handful of African countries including Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Zaire. It was an incongruous affair by all ac- counts. The expectations that art could pro- vide a source for cultural dialogue were high in the minds of the Senegalese organizers. With a budget of 300 million CFA (approxi- mately ?780,000) from the Senegalese govern- ment and French sources, and elections very close by, the Biennale could be nothing but complicit with official structures. If there was a political agenda behind the manifest dedi- cation to art by Diouf's socialist government, it was to coopt "international" strategies in view of establishing a more successful distri- bution and commercialization of contempo- rary art in Africa. The economic imperative was ingrained in the figure of the artist as someone who would not only need but also benefit from the author- ity, expertise, and protection of critical as well as mercantile structures. A subjacent memory and legitimate apprehension of aesthetic exploitation as the dark side of European "Primitivism" soon developed over the course of the Biennale into violent outbursts of neo- colonial discord. Art was clearly the issue, but 18 african arts</page><page sequence="2">0 V1 0] a- L.KRHN GALLERY INC 560 BROADWAY-SUITE 508 NYC 10012/966-1138 art was conceived as a powerful cultural com- modity which needed to be properly initiated, presented, evaluated, invested in, purchased, and preserved. Control was at stake, and bitter arguments between French and African art brokers constantly threatened to demolish the entente cordiale of internationalist collaboration. In a shadow play of Langian bombastic cultur- al policy, the actors behind the Biennale des Arts had never seriously considered the ex- traordinary potential of such an event to bring together African artists practicing both at home and abroad to discuss the present surge of interest in new art from Africa. This made it one of the most interesting yet complex expressions of the interconnectedness of art and society in recent history. The Dakar Biennale, which lasted for seven days, was divided into several forums of exchange organized around the central exhibitions at the IFAN, the Galerie Nationale d'Art Moderne, the satellite shows at the vari- ous foreign cultural institutes, and an exhibi- tion of children's work at the Lycee Blaise Senghor. During two days of conferences, an international panel of experts was asked to consider the reception and distribution of African art, the future form art criticism might take in Africa, modernity in contemporary African art, and finally, popular art and popu- lar creativity. The workshops which followed brought patrons, gallery owners, dealers, and curators together with artists in an effort to realize specific artistic projects. Giving the whole event a festive air were stalls of arts and crafts at the Village de la Biennale and the outdoor stage on the Place de l'Obelisque, which offered the Dakarois the chance to experience their favorite stars for free, from Youssou N'Dour to Baaba Maal, Omar Pene to Aicha Kond and the Zairean Soukous Stars. Thirty thousand people pressed the streets at night, crushing forward to the central plat- form, to see Baaba Maal perform his vibrant mix of mbalax and reggae barely kept under control by a dozen young soldiers swinging their rubber truncheons like bull-roarers over the crowds. At the five-star Hotel Teranga on the Place de l'Independance, the guests com- plained among themselves of the Biennale's disorganization, the insufficient hotel rooms, poor selection criteria, and the shoddy and cramped presentation of work of generally bad quality. Gathered together in the restau- rant or mulling around the lobby in between the snapshot salesmen, a strange mix of inter- ested parties seemed unable to communicate with one another. Many artists felt betrayed by the organizers; works had been lost, badly stored, damaged, or more acutely, just ne- glected. Ery Camara, a Senegalese painter and museologist based in Mexico City, resort- ed to private showings of his work in the confines of his hotel room. Ousmane Sow, a leading Senegalese sculptor who recently took part in "Documenta IX" in Kassel, hav- ing decided not to participate in the Biennale for personal reasons, was made to witness the insensitive and debatably illegitimate lending of his work by a collector. Iba N'Diaye, the revered founder, together with Papa Ibra Tall and Pierre Lods, of the tcole de Dakar and honorary artist of the Biennale, never received his airline ticket and was noticeably absent from the cast. A Belgian artist's explanation of how he had received the official invitation to exhibit his works centered more around personal connections than around the quality of his art. There were two essential flaws in the Biennale's conception. First was the misguid- ed faith in the so-called international art cir- cuit, which deterred the organizers from developing a pan-African focus. Such an arts festival might have succeeded in breaking down the isolation experienced by young artists and critics working at different ends of the African continent. It would have helped solder stronger ties with colleagues from the Diaspora and undoubtedly would have attracted substantial African-American finance. Moreover, a pan-African Biennale would have been an aesthetic and cultural bombshell, exploding at the heart of current Euro-American interest and speculation in contemporary African arts. There was overall consensus on the topicality and appropriate- ness of the conference themes, which needed to be debated immediately, before "contem- porary" art, like earlier "traditional" art, became encapsulated by outside interests. A A FRICAN ART JOHN FALCON BY APPOINTMENT ONLY: (212)321-2885 20 african arts</page><page sequence="3">number of French art critics displayed a marked resistance to releasing their hold on expertise in both specialist art-historical sub- jects and more general domains, such as how to chair a session or preside over the jury. This led to outright confrontations which would have been unimaginable in such neo- colonial form had there been greater partici- pation from within Africa itself. The second oversight was perhaps more tragic; yet it was clearly symptomatic of pres- ent conditions. It can be best described as a gaze diverted from its object, blind to the source of its interest. For where in all the pomp and circumlocution of the Biennale des Arts were the artists? In what manner could one sense their presence, hear their concerns, and savor the oblique precision of their visu- al and conceptual agendas? The main exhibi- tions did provide an enormously diverse survey of contemporary art, but the uneven quality and jumbled presentation dismayed artists and public alike. Through the organi- zational and conceptual confusion, the artists were given short shrift on several accounts. Souleiyman Keita's anger at having his large triptych ?tude des Signes confined to a pas- sageway in the entrance to the IFAN was publicly reported in the Dakar newspaper Sud-Hebdo. It indicated the total absence of the artists' participation in the presentation of their works, an exacting and creative activity ideally negotiated between curator and artist. Zoulou Mbaye, another Senegalese artist now based (like many) in Paris, ferociously con- fronted a French critic on her interpretation of African art with the result that the session rapidly turned into a brawl and police were called in to restore calm. No one, it seemed, was prepared to listen to the artists and give them a specific visionary authority within the Biennale over and above the mob of critics and bureaucrats from Europe and Africa. Not willing to accept the position of back- benchers, certain respected and ground- breaking Senegalese artists refused to take part in Dak'Art 92, among them Joe Ouakam (Issa Samb) and El Sy (El Hadji Moussa Babacar Sy). Working independently, yet united in their activities around the Lab- oratoire Agit Art, both artists felt deeply ill at ease with the heavy-handedness of the Ministry of Culture. While Ouakam showed small works in independent spaces alongside other more mildly dissident artists, El Sy flat- ly refused to exhibit in the Dak'Art 92 envi- ronment at all. Instead he participated with the magazine Revue Noire, which produced by far the most exciting survey of current Senegalese art, including features on portraits by Mor Faye and Sdrigne Mbaye Camara, Joe Ouakam, and the outstanding photographers Mama Casset and Bouna M~doune Seye. A CD with the latest in Senegalese jazz and soul and featuring some hot sounds by Abi N'Dour (Youssou's sister) and the Wolof rap duo Positive Black Soul came free with the review. Transtel Television flew over from Germany to cover the Biennale and do a fea- ture on El Sy's work.

At the inaugural speech of Dak'Art 92, President Diouf regretted that the former president, who lives in France, could not be with them this time and spoke of Senghor's heart "beat- ing to the rhythm of the Biennale." Senghor's influence is still strongly appar- ent in the unbelievable profusion of visual artists in Senegal today. No other neighboring country except for Nigeria can boast so many painters, sculptors, and mixed-media artists crossing over into film, music, theater, dance, and oratory. There were several distinguished Senegalese artists in the Biennale, including Amadou Sow, Babacar Sedikh Traore, Fode Camara, and Viyd Diba. In addition Fon- dation Afrique en Creations sponsored a magnificent wall hanging measuring approxi- mately six by twenty meters, painted by Babacar L6, Cheikh Niass, Fode Camara, and Ibou Diouf. Stretched across an entire comer of the Place de l'Independance, this spectacu- larly colorful backdrop, which recounted the Legend of the Spoken Word, provided an instant reminder to passersby of the vivacity and continuity in African art today. In the main exhibition hall, Senegalese artists outnumbered their colleagues from Southern, Central, East, and North Africa, whose participation had been neglected by the organizers in favor of a Western Euro- pean and African-American slant. With the subheading "Arts et Regards Croises sur l'Afrique" suggesting a crossover of artistic</page><page sequence="5">perspectives on Africa, several French and Italian artists had delved freely into Africana with more or less a measure of grace. Claudio Costa's collage of bones, earth, patinated "trib- al" markings and musical instruments was an insult to the sophisticated mixed-media ex- pressions so characteristic of twentieth-cen- tury African art from Senegal's own Younousse Seye to Nigeria's Jimoh Buraimoh. A French artist initiated a happening in the Maison des Esclaves on the slave island of Goree ("where tears of granite are wept"), which involved slitting his wrists and the wrists of the elderly museum curator, mixing their blood with red pigment in a calabash, and then using it to paint an inverted triangle on a white canvas. As observers scurried to find plasters to ban- dage the men's veins, the artist refused to answer the pertinent questions of fellow col- league Ery Camara, who sought to establish why the Frenchman, in a location loaded with hundreds of years of human anguish, had dis- empowered the triangle, "the potent symbol of cosmological unity in Africa" (Camara). Whether or not the inversion was a reference to the scourge of AIDS is a post-hoc interpreta- tion which hardly excuses such an insensitive action. In an exhibition dedicated to the rights of man, the presupposition that art could tran- scend cultural difference was laid bare. Of the African-American participation, the young artist Leonardo Drew received the most attention. Shortlisted for the Grand Prize of the Biennale, his softly layered works made of rust and linen were a seductive material alternative to the more conventional paintings and sculpture on display. With an academic posse from Howard University, including Jeff Donaldson, the founder of AFRICOBRA and current Dean of the Visual Arts Department, as well as Kwaku Ansah and the Nigerian Odita, the African-American presence was prominent though strangely out on a limb given the meager participation of continental African artists and the lack of central focus on Africa and the Diaspora. Nevertheless it was Moustapha Dime of Senegal and Zerihun Yetmgeta of Ethiopia who jointly carried off the Grand Prize and FF100,00 (?12,000). Working with driftwood and tarnished metal, Dime created sea- washed women who, propped on rusty poles, held perfect balance, gently swaying to the suggestion of African wood sculpture while defying the polished idiom of modernist form. Yetmgeta's woven parchment and bamboo paravents made on narrow strip looms and infused with Coptic and modernist iconogra- phy had been an immediate success at the opening of the exhibition. One reason why the prizewinning work was so convincing was the ability of both these artists to master their cho- sen medium to the point of its poetic dissolu- tion in the piece. As the Senegalese Alioune Badiane, who works in appliqued fabric, remarked at one of the workshops, African artists are still under the European dictator- ship of painting to the detriment of all other media (Wal Fadjri, no. 344, Dec. 18-24, p. 7). This is one of the dilemmas currently at the core of contemporary African visual arts. It introduces a specific aesthetic and cultural complexity into the discursive yet ultimately superficial crisis surrounding the current clas- sification of stylistic diversity in Africa today. For beyond the curatorial disputes about whether one can speak of "popular art" or "international art" lie the concerns of painters and sculptors in Africa whose histories are firmly rooted in European as well as African art, a dialogue which runs back 500 years or more and extends beyond questions of style and medium. Underlying the negotiation at the Biennale of prospective international com- mercialization and distribution was a much more pressing issue having to do with the translation in art of the relationship between the artist, the work, and the public. How to bring the creative curve back to Africa and instill in the work, in all its heterogeneity, a natural significance akin to the earlier status of "traditional" art, yet clearly for the present and without the habitual projection of nostal- gia, is a text woven into the material of con- temporary African art. To read signs of such engagement you have to look away from the glare of spotlit galleries, where interaction is increasingly bankrupt, and focus once again on the seams of art and society. A wooden stretcher once used on the island of Goree, rice sacks made of thick jute, and blocks of wood in rounded shapes too bulky to discern play into the hands of El Sy, who rubs paint onto the surface of the sack- ing, molding it to his ideas. Neither tapestry nor painting (though reflective of these forms in Senegalese modern art), they hang from wooden poles reaching forward into the room in an extension of volume, line, and color. A dusty turquoise blue and bright orange shine clear against the tar-stained blacks, grays, and browns. These works with their vaguely anthropomorphic references and curvaceous symbols stand between walls of sight, where dimensions are recast and the fallout of mod- ernist art history is recycled into unforeseen shape. And yet there is no incongruity in El Sy's work; it carries no sense of displacement or clues of visible struggle. Each painting rests on another painting both in time and space. Shrinking the orthodox measure of dis- tance between exhibits, El Sy ingeniously acti- vates a vernissage in his studio, merging and overlapping one work with the another, and calling into doubt the formal security of dis- cemrning white walls. If the gallery space is showing increasing signs of incompatibility with the new, more socially site-specific work produced by artists in Europe and America, then Africa could well be at the core of a transformation, one which begins to challenge entrenched aesthet- ic and social concepts of visual history. Perhaps El Sy's art is about returning the curve back to Africa, and perhaps the orga- nizers of the Biennale des Arts were not mis- taken in emphasizing the economic protection of African artists amid growing speculation. The difference in their approaches is to be judged in context, as individual yet connected responses to the growing fragmentation of late-twentieth-century edifices of cultural value. For there may well be another Biennale des Arts in Africa in the near future, only next time national representation is likely to be decentralized, to embrace simultaneous sites of action in locations all over the African con- tinent and the Diaspora. More important, it may well be led by artists, voiced by artists, and made visible to the public through chan- nels which once again reestablish the fine line of communication between the artist, the work, and the public.
