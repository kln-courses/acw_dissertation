<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUME AND THE DEISTS: A CONTRAST IN RELIGIOUS APPROACHES c CLEANTHES in Hume's Dialogues on Natural Religion has been variously identified with Joseph Butler, George Berkeley, and certain of the members of the Royal Society.1 Demea, the un bending dogmatist, certainly, in one passage at least, represents Samuel Clarke, but he has also been identified, with some justification, with the theologians of the school of William King, Archbishop of Dublin, William Law, and Peter Browne.2 Philo the sceptic is most frequently associated with Hume himself, although there is a good deal to be said for the point of view which asserts that all these characters express, in varying degrees, the conflicting opinions of their creator. But all three also have certain characteristics of the Deism of the earlier part of the century. In his letters Hume writes of the 'cry of Deism' which was raised against him and, writing to Dr. John Clephane in February 1757,3 he seems to imply that there was a 'tincture of Deism' in his History of England.England. He never, he said, had 'imagined that it would dampen the sale of a book'. But he uses the word in a popular sense, as the equivalent of unbelief. Between Hume and the Deists there lay a considerable gulf, though there were similarities between his opinions and theirs. It is both of interest and instructive to examine the relations between the two, to see how they differed and what they had in common. It has been said that Hume argued himself out of religion. It might equally or with more truth be held that he argued himself out of Deism. It was not by accident that he entitled his most notable theological work Dialogues on Natural Religion.Religion. What is probably the most complete analysis and definition of Deism was given by Samuel Clarke in his Boyle Lectures of 1704/5.4 He divided Deists into four classes: into those who held the existence of God but denied that he concerned himself in the government of the world; those who held the existence and material providence of God but denied that he was concerned with the morally good and evil actions of men; those who believed in God and his providence and in his 1 Anders Jeffner, Butler and Hume on Religion (Stockholm, 1966), pp. 131-43. 2 Ibid., pp. 185, 186, 196-8. 3 National Library of Scotland., Acc.

O'HIGGINS insistence on man's obedience but denied the immortality of the human soul; and those who believed in God, in providence, in Natural Religion and a future life with rewards and punishments, but who denied Revelation. The first class, that of men who considered God immeasur ably remote from the world he had made, was most typical of French Deism, of both the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the last, with its emphasis on Natural Religion, and, by consequence, on reason, and by its denial of Revelation, was characteristic of Deism as it was to be found in England. Hume's cast of mind was more to resemble that of the first type of Deist than that of the second. But the way by which he was to reach a conviction of the remoteness of the Deity was to be very different from that of the Deists. It is worth considering the attitude of the French philosophical Deists. It was influenced by the new science, with its mechanistic picture of the universe, though one should note that, certainly in seventeenth-century England, the scientists were on the side of the angels. Even the secretly highly unorthodox Sir Isaac Newton regarded science as a strong support to religion. Descartes, with his mechanistic explanation of the laws of motion, received a share of the blame for encouraging Deism. '1 cannot forgive Descartes;' wrote Blaise Pascal, 'he would have liked, in the whole of his philosophy, to be able to by pass God. But he could not help making Him give a shove to set the world in motion; after that he has nothing further to do with God.'1 It was not entirely a fair judgement. Descartes insisted that, by his con tinual recreation or rather conservation of the universe, God was in constant intimate contact with it.2 Genuine Deism, however, appeared in more popular works and in particular in the imaginary voyages of the time; in, for example, Les Avantures de Jacques Sadeur of the ex-monk Gabriel de Foigny of 1676 and in L'Histoire des Sevarambesoi the Protes tant Denis Vairasse d'Alais of 1677. Both were fictitious accounts of journeys to an imaginary Australian land and both were deistic propa ganda. D'Alais said of the religion of the Sevarambians that, if it were not the most reasonable, it was that which was most conformed to human reason,3 while Foigny, in Jacques Sadeur, regarded God as the 1 'Je ne puis pardonner a Descartes; il auroit bien voulu, dans toute sa philo sophie, pouvoir se passer de Dieu; mais il n'a pu s'empecher de lui faire donner une chiquenaude, pour mettre le monde en mouvement; aprfcs cela, il n'a plus que faire de Dieu'; B.

English Deism did not emphasize the remoteness of the Deity. Its target was Revelation, the clerical order—though one should notice that some of the Deists, Woolston and Morgan, for example, were Protestant ministers themselves, while John Toland once had aspirations to the dissenting ministry and Anthony Collins had some very close friends among the clergy—and supernatural religion. Religion had to be brought down to the level of and to be fully comprehended by human reason. Moreover, it could be worked out by unaided human reason. One similarity with the continental Deists can be seen. A revelation would be a particular Divine intervention in human affairs. In denying it God was being kept at a distance. Deism in England did not spring out of the blue. In its early eigh teenth-century form it can be regarded as coming from within English Protestantism. It is for this reason that Hume's Demea and Cleanthes can be seen as reflecting not only Clarke and Butler but the English Deists as well. The reaction against the enthusiasm, which it was con sidered had led to the civil war, with a corresponding emphasis on the part that reason should play in religion—an emphasis that dated from even before the civil war, among the friends, for example, of Lucius Cary, second Viscount Falkland—the attention paid by protestant divines to Natural Religion and the stress on morality rather than on dogma all could lead in the direction of Deism. Science could play its part. The Honourable Robert Boyle, the founder of the Boyle lectures, that were intended to defend Christianity against unbelief, in his reli gious writings had a great deal to say about God the Creator but sur prisingly little about Christ.7 His argument for the existence of God was that derived from the order to be found in the universe and his favourite comparison was that of this cosmic machine to the great clock 1 G. de Foigny, La Terre australe connue (Vannes, 1676), p. 115.

From two of the works of the wealthy Essex squire Anthony Collins, one can gather something of an idea of the English writers who had affected the Deists. In the Discourse of Freethinking he gives a list of men whom he considers to have been freethinkers.2 Admittedly his list is a a very mixed bag. He seems to have wanted to include everyone who ever had had an original thought. A freethinker he defined as 'a man who did not take up his opinions upon the authority of any man, or encourage others to do so'.3 In the Introduction to the Grounds and Reasons Reasons of the Christian Religion, he gives a second list of 'men of learn ing, penetration, and integrity' whose 'intimate thoughts' one should 'be glad to know'.4 Again he was defending the freedom of publication. Both lists included Hales, Chillingworth, Whichcote, More, Cudworth, Tillotson, and Locke. To Tillotson, in the earlier work, he devoted a separate section of six pages in a book of 178,5 the longest single treatment of any single indivi dual in the book. It might be asked whether he was sincere in his admiration or whether he was using great names to defend his point of view. It would seem he was not simply feigning admiration. Locke had been his very close friend. Pierre Desmaiseaux, the refugee Huguenot journalist, another man who was very close to him, wrote the lives of Hales and Chillingworth. Collins gave him some assistance, invited him to his house at Great Baddow near Chelmsford to complete the work6 and of Hales wrote, in connection with the biography, in a letter to Desmaiseaux, that 'he was a man, with whose life and character and writings one would desire to be acquainted'.7 Tillotson was the man whom he held in special admiration and it would seem, on balance, that this admiration was quite genuine. He quoted Tillotson's strictures on Church Councils8 and on what he 1 R. S. Westfall, op. cit., pp. 73-5. 2 A.

But Collins seems to imply more than this; that Tillotson was hinting that Revelation should not go beyond or above Natural Religion. Collins was a careless, though not a dishonest reader, a fault for which he was severely mauled by Richard Bentley. He was not alone in his misinterpretation. Gilbert Burnet, in his funeral sermon on Tillotson said of him that 'his endeavouring to make out everything in religion from clear and plain principles, and with a fulness of demonstrative proof, was laid hold on to make him pass for one that could believe nothing that could lay beyond the compass of human reason'.3 It was in Tillotson's defence of human reason and in what Collins considered was his bringing of revealed at least very close to natural religion that the Deist considered lay the merit of his opinions. A final major influence on Deism that needs consideration was that of John Locke. His Essay on Human Understanding was used by the Deists to destroy the idea of mystery in religion. In it he regarded substance as an unknown substratum of the qualities of objects. The real essences of things we do not know, only their nominal essences, their appearances. And in his Reasonableness of Christianity, though it was intended, as its title suggests, to show the reasonableness of the Christian religion, he reduced the essential dogmas of Christianity to a single article, that Jesus is the Messiah, mentioned no Christian mystery, and even though he expressly denied that Christ is 'nothing but the restorer and preacher of pure natural religion',4 made this latter and Christianity look remark ably similar. When taxed with rejecting the doctrine of the Trinity and of the Incarnation he seemed remarkably evasive, said that 'Socinianism is not the fault of the book',5 but avoided making any positive declara tion of his belief in these mysteries. From a letter of January 1700 to Philip van Limborch6 it can reasonably be argued that he was in fact in a state of uncertainty. 1 A Discourse of Freethinking, p. 174.

O'HIGGINS It was precisely on this question of mystery in religion, of truths above reason, that the main Deistic controversy began, with the publica tion, in 1696, of Christianity not Mysterious. Locke's epistemology was directly involved. John Toland, the author of the work, is ranked as one of the leading Deists. It may well be questioned how far he de served the appellation, though his treatment of the part that reason should play in religion, in 1696, certainly merits the term. He was an Irishman, born a Catholic, almost certainly illegitimate, was educated probably at the expense of Dr. Ezekiel Hopkins, the Anglican Bishop of Derry, became a Protestant probably before the age of sixteen, went to the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, where he failed to gain the patronage of the Archbishop of Glasgow, became a Presbyterian, in indignation at the latter failure, and then went to London where a number of Dissenters decided to send him to Leyden to become a Presbyterian minister. However, after a year at this University, and after a quarrel, the nature of which it is impossible to verify with certainty, he returned to London in 1693. Now, to use his own words, he began to allow him self a latitude in religion1 and, in 1696, he wrote Christianity not Mysterious.Mysterious. By 1704, from his Letters to Serena, published in that year, it would seem that his religious position had undergone a further change. Two of the Letters or essays—dedicated to Sophia Charlotte, Queen of Prussia—deal with the philosophy of Spinoza. He criticized Spinoza on the ground that his theory gave an inadequate explanation of motion. Motion, he said, must be essential to matter. He was aware that this theory might seem to make God unnecessary. Certainly he directly rejected the Cartesian idea that God continues to impart motion to the world every moment.2 God, he said, could have created matter with motion as one of its essential qualities, but a creation by God was necessary to explain order in the world; to explain, for example, the formation of plants and animals.3 By 1707, in Adeisidaemon, a work dedicated to Anthony Collins and an ostensible defence of Livy from the charge of superstition, he was, like Bayle, in his Pensees sur la Comete,Comete, defending the good atheist, who, he said, does good for the sheer love of virtue and not out of hope of future reward or fear of future punishment. Most organized religion he equated with super stition. But before his death in 1722 he had become a pantheist. He, in fact, coined the word. His Pantheisticon, printed privately in 1720, was less akin to the philosophy of Spinoza than to the pantheistic im manentism of Giordano Bruno, whose life he wrote, whose Dialogues 1 J.

His attitude towards the place that reason should play in religion can be seen in such works as Hodegus, written in 1708, but published in the collection of works entitled Tetradymus, in which he gave a rationalist explanation of the pillar of fire which guided the Israelites in the desert, and in the second of the essays in the Letters to Serena, in which he derived the idea of survival after death from the ancient Egyptian burial rites. He safeguarded himself by asserting also the revealed Christian doctrine of life after death, but both works show his extreme rationaliz ing inclinations. But it is in his earliest and best-known work, Christianity not not Mysterious, that he made his most effective contribution to Deistic thought. In it he declared that in the New Testament the word 'mystery' meant something hidden but something that can be fully comprehended when revealed. But it was from Locke that he took his philosophical argument, '1 distinguish, after an excellent modern philosopher,' he wrote, 'the nominal from the real essence of a thing.'2 Real essences are quite unknown to us, he said, and he went on: 'nothing is a mystery, because we know not its essence ... so that the divine being himself cannot with more reason be accounted mysterious in this respect, than the most contemptible of his creatures.'3 His position was made clear in his Introduction to the book. 'We hold that reason is the only foundation of all certitude; and that nothing revealed, whether as to its manner or existence, is more exempted from its disquisitions, than the ordinary phenomena of nature . . . there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to reason nor above it; and ... no Christian doctrine can properly be call'd a mystery.'4 Locke had considered that human reason unaided could not even attain to the perfection of Natural Religion. Toland had admitted that 'If by reason be understood a constant right use of these faculties'—the faculties of judging 'according to clear perceptions' and desiring what is 1 Among the Toland MSS. in the British Museum, there is a list of Toland's 'Manuscripts of mine abroad'. This list includes a life of Bruno and a translation of his Dialogues (Add. MS. 4295, f. 43). On the flyleaf of a copy of the rare translation of The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast (London, 1713), which be longed to James Martineau (1805-1900), and which is kept in the library of Manchester College, Oxford, there is a manuscript note in Martineau's hand, to the effect that the translation had been made for Anthony Collins by W. Morehead. Collins had not intended to have the translation published, but it was 'removed' by Toland and he had a few copies printed. 2 J.

O'HIGGINS truly good—then 'it is extremely corrupt'.1 Matthew Tindal, the fellow of All Souls, who became a Catholic in the reign of James II and reverted to Protestantism shortly before the Revolution of 1688 and who died in in in 1733, still, in spite of his writings, holding his fellowship, was more optimistic with regard to reason. In his Christianity as Old as the Crea tion,tion, of 1730, he was probably the most complete exponent of Natural Religion. This work represents a point of view that was, in many respects, flatly contradicted by David Hume's Natural History of Religion.Religion. In 1717 Tindal had published his Rights of the Christian Church Church Asserted, a book of extreme anti-clericalism, that would have completely subordinated Church to State. Now, in his later work, only the first volume of which was published, the manuscript of the second being destroyed by Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, after Tindal's death, he developed his theory of Natural Religion. Man by his unaided reason can prove the existence of God,2 demonstrate his attributes, and work out for himself the whole of religion. All men are capable of doing this and the religion they so discover has been perfect and immutable from the beginning of the world. Revelation, it would follow, is un necessary, and it is true only if it fits in with the original conclusions of reason. 'By Natural Religion', he wrote, '1 understand the belief of the existence of a God, and the sense and practice of those duties, which result from the knowledge we, by our reason, have of him and his perfections.'3 'Our reason, which gives us a demonstration of the divine perfections, affords us the same concerning the nature of those duties God requires, not only with relation to himself, but to ourselves, and one another.'4 'By living according to the rules of right reason, we more and more implant in us the moral perfections of God'5—a sentiment very different from that of Hume, who held that God has no reference to our moral lives. 'This law'—of Nature—'like its author, is absolutely perfect, eternal and unchangeable; and . . . the design of the Gospel was not to add to, or take from this law; but to free men from that load of superstition, which had been mix'd with it. So that true Christianity is not a religion of yesterday, but what God, at the beginning, dictated and still continues to dictate to Christians, as well as others.'6 This religion, however, as one would expect from Tindal's premisses is in no way supernatural. To him faith was simply the acceptance of a historical proposition and quite unnecessary for salvation. 'When we say, Caesar conquered Pompey,' he wrote, 'we, having no idea of either can only mean, somebody conquered somebody; and have we more distinct 1 Christianity not Mysterious, p. 57. 22 M.

'Could those philosophers, who did not imagine any virtue in sacrificing of beasts, to wash away the sins of men,' he asked, 'easily conceive a human sacrifice, which they believ'd human nature abhorred, to be an expiation for sins?'2 'Can anything be more evident, than that, if doing evil is the only foundation of God's displeasure; ceasing to do evil, and doing the contrary will take away that displeasure ?3י 'In religion there are no nostrums, or secrets, but all may know what God requires of all; and there is but one universal remedy for all sick persons, repentance and amendment.'4 Mysteries in religion he dis missed as 'the ravings of an enthusiast'.5 Prayer of intercession, as distinct from contemplation—though Tindal hardly strikes one as being a very contemplative soul—he rejected. 'There are few so gross as to imagine, that we can direct infinite wisdom in the dispensation of providence, or persuade him'—God—'to alter those laws he con triv'd before the foundation of the world for putting things in a regular course?'6 This, at least, was a Deistic sentiment with which Hume would have found himself in hearty agreement. Only one thing clouded Tindal's optimism, superstition manipulated by the clergy. Each species, he held, had an 'innate weakness'. 'Now the peculiar foible of mankind is superstition, which at all times had made them liable to be practis'd on, not by creatures of different species, but by those of their own.'7 From this, it would seem, comes the greater part of the ills of mankind. 'Yet men, tho' they can't subsist but in society, and have hands, speech, and reason to qualify them for the blessing of it above all other animals; nay, what is more, have religion, design'd to unite them in the bonds of love and friendship ... and the good natur'd laity too have, at a vast expence, hired persons to inculcate these generous notions; yet alas! in spite of all these helps and motives, religion has been made by these very persons, a pretence to render men unsociable, fierce, and cruel, and to act everything destructive to their common welfare.'8 Whatever one may say of the consistency of his system and, given its premisses, it was beautifully consistent, his approach to the problem of evil was a little naive. But Hume, perhaps without directly adverting to Deism, put his finger on the rationale behind the theory. 1 Christianity as Old as the Creation, p. 48. 2 Ibid., p. 419. 3 Ibid., pp. 417-18. 4 Ibid., p. 49. 5 Ibid., p. 222. 6 Ibid., p. 44. 7 Ibid., p. 169. 8 Ibid., p. 165.</page><page sequence="10">488 J. O'HIGGINS It was anthropomorphic, and therefore the supernatural could be excluded. When Tindal, orthodoxly enough, talks of God making man in his own image, one might well ask whether he was not, in fact re versing the creative process. He wrote: 'We may contemplate the great dignity of our rational nature, since our reason for kind, tho' not for degree, is of the same nature with that of God's; nay 'Tis our reason which makes us the image of God himself.'1 This anthropomorphism— an assertion of the idea that God's attributes are univocal with ours— comes out most clearly in one of the early works of Anthony Collins. It implies a Deism very different from that of the remote God of Jacques Sadeur, but it led to the same conclusion, the elimination of the supernatural in human life. Anthony Collins was one of the most colourful of the Deists. A very wealthy man, with one of the largest private libraries in England, he was educated at Eton, Cambridge, and the Middle Temple. He did not take his degree nor was he called to the Bar. In 1714 he moved from London to Essex, where he became the leading figure in the county administration, Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant, and County Treasurer. In his late twenties and in the last period of the life of John Locke he became the latter's very close friend. Locke had a high opinion of his ability and seems to have considered his religious position, then, to be the same as his own. From 1707 to 1727 he was to write voluminously, on Church history, philosophy, and theology. In 1709, in a pamphlet, Priestcraft in Perfection, and again in 1724, in An Historical and and Critical Essay on the Thirty Nine Articles, he asserted that the first clause in Article 20 of the Thirty-nine Articles, 'The Church hath power to decree rites or ceremonies and authority in controversies of faith' was a forgery, inserted in the Articles in the seventeenth century. He put up a solid argument, though not one that proved his contention. In 1713 appeared his notorious Discourse of Freethinking, a defence of free thinking as such. Richard Bentley and Jonathan Swift dealt so savagely, the one with his scholarship, the other with the logic of his argument, that for a time his literary reputation seemed totally destroyed. This did not succeed in stopping his writing. His most significant works were a number of shorter writings on philosophy and three longer ones on theology; A Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion,Religion, The Scheme of Literal Prophecy considered and A Letter to Dr.Dr. Rogers. In Collins's philosophical writings human reason was paramount. His first work, The Use of Reason in Propositions, the Evidence ■whereof 1 Christianity as Old as the Creation, p. 24.</page><page sequence="11">HUME AND THE DEISTS 489 depends depends on Human Testimony, of 1707, took up the same position as that of Toland's Christianity not Mysterious. Its line of argument was rather different and it was less provocative. Francis Gastrell, later Bishop of Chester, whom Collins criticized in the work, considered that Collins believed in the Scriptures; 'whatever', he added, 'you may do seven years hence'.1 The argument was again based on the epistemology of Locke. The propositions we frame, he wrote, 'stand for known ideas, or ideas that we are capable of forming; for if they stand for ideas that we know not, or want faculties to perceive, there are then no objects for the mind to exert itself upon'.2 This was pretty clearly a restatement of Locke's declaration that 'we can have knowledge no farther than we can have ideas'.3 Like Locke, Collins gave no precise definition of what he meant by the term 'idea'. We cannot believe, he said, anything that is contrary to our perceptions and by this latter term he meant anything that involves a logical contradiction or is contrary to the evidence of our senses. He was not using the word 'perception' very precisely. Moreover he took up, on occasion, a very subjective view of what we should accept. 'We can only govern ourselves by seeming relations and ap pearances, because real relations and appearances can but seem to be relations and appearances.'4 The centre of his argument was this, that we cannot be expected to believe anything that does not come within the field of our perceptions. He conceded, in dealing with the mystery of the Trinity, that God might have ideas peculiar to himself but un known to man. He wrote 'If our belief consists only in this, that God has ideas to such and such words, and that those ideas do agree to one another; what can be more plain or less hard to be understood than this? Do we not meet with men every day that use words for ideas peculiar to themselves, and that may for aught we know perceive a relation between those ideas ?5י Earlier he had used a comparison of men speaking an un known language. But it was clear from his rather confused analysis of the phrase 'above reason' that he considered that Revelation could only be divided into truths according to reason and truths contrary to reason and that by the former class he meant propositions that can be fully comprehended by man. There was no room in any creed for a truth above reason. Rather curiously he declared that certain things that Hume would also say are unknown to us are above reason. 'Things are said to be above reason, when we are ignorant of the manner, or of the 1 Francis Gastrell, A Defence of some Considerations concerning the Trinity (London, 1707), p. 26. 2 A.

O'HIGGINS physical cause of their existence: As for instance we know not how matter exists, nor how the parts hang together . . . here it is visible the words "above reason" do not stand for any thing that is the object of the understanding; for whenever the manner or physical cause of a thing is unknown we can frame no propositions about it.'1 The charge that Locke's theory led to scepticism would, one might expect, seem to be substantiated by statements such as these, but in fact Collins's principal opponent, John Witty, used a Lockean argument to confute him. We do not have ideas of real essences, he said, but we can assent to their existence. Why should we not be able to do the same about mysteries ? The general line of reply was that of Francis Gastrell, who said that a legitimate meaning can be attached to the words 'above reason', namely 'such things as by the utmost stretch of our faculties we can know but imperfectly and in part'.2 In this Essay Collins already showed himself a determinist. He eliminated the mystery of the reconciliation of Divine foreknowledge and free will by denying the latter. Again reason was paramount. His full position was developed in his Philosophical Inquiry into Human Liberty of 1717. In the earlier work he talked of the will being causally deter mined according to the 'appearing agreeableness or disagreeableness'3 of the object. In the Inquiry he wrote 'willing or preferring, is the same with respect to good and evil, that judging is with respect to truth or falshood. It is judging, that one thing is upon the whole better than another . . . Wherefore as we judge of truth or falshood according to appearances so we must will or prefer as things seem to us, unless we can lye to ourselves.'4 He identified the act of will and judgement and had man necessitated to act as his reason judged appearances. There was what can be regarded as a sequel to the Essay on the Use of Reason.Reason. This was the brief work entitled A Vindication of the Divine Attributes,Attributes, of 1710. It was a reply to a sermon given by William King, Archbishop of Dublin, on the question of the reconciliation of Divine foreknowledge and man's free will and in it Collins joined in a minor role in the controversy on analogy in which were involved, among others, King, George Berkeley, and Peter Browne, Bishop of Cork. Hume, as Jeffner suggests, may well have had King in mind when he created the Demea of his Dialogues. Collins had some of the characteristics of both Demea and Cleanthes. Like Demea, Collins considered that one can demonstrate the existence of God. Unlike Demea, he declared we have 1 An Essay on the Use of Reason, p. 29. 2 A Defence, p. 14. 3 An Essay, pp. 48-9. 4 A.

Like Cleanthes and like Tindal his concept of those attributes was anthropomorphic. Tindal, it is worth noting, used the same argument as Cleanthes to prove God exists, that from design, but, unlike Hume's character, he thought it was a demonstration.2 The essence of God, said Collins, we do not know and in this he was arguing, not from the mysteriousness of God, but from Locke's doctrine of real essences. 'We do not pretend to have any positive direct notion of his being', he wrote, 'but only of his attributes; and our notion is, that he is an eternal, immaterial, infinitely perfect being; and more particularly that he is infinitely wise, powerful, just and good. The way whereby we arrive at this notion of God, is by observing the several perfections that are everywhere display'd in the parts of the Universe; and knowing that these perfections observable in the Universe have a beginning, and knowing that what has a beginning must receive its existence from another being (for no being can give itself a perfection which it has not) we conclude that all the perfections visible in the world must be attributes of the eternal being, from whence all particular perfections that exist in time proceed.'3 He was not de veloping a theory of pantheism. He said God cannot be the universe itself 'but a being distinct from the universe, which we call immaterial'.4 However, in contradistinction to King, he considered that God's perfec tions are univocal with ours, though of a different degree. The Scrip ture, he asserts—and here he is giving his own opinion—'When it came to give him such moral attributes as wisdom, justice and goodness and such natural attributes as will and foreknowledge, it was with design that we should take them to be really in God as they are in us, and of the same kind, only that he has them in the highest degree possible.'5 This was exactly the position in which Hume placed Cleanthes in contra distinction to the opinion of men such as King. And again, in the case of Collins, a mystery was eliminated and God's attributes brought within the comprehension of human reason, even though he said that 'our con ceptions of those attributes do not reach the full extent of them as they are in God'.6 Collins's later works were better written and more important. They were also more opposed to Christianity, though Collins remained a com municating member of the Church of England till his death—this, of course, was a necessity for a Justice of the Peace—became genuinely outraged when he was accused of hypocrisy for receiving the sacrament in the Church, and died, apparently, associating himself with what he A.

In Grounds and Reasons and The Scheme Scheme of Literal Prophecy he attacked the basis of Christianity pre cisely as Locke had defined it. Using a scheme of prophecy that was currently associated with the Arminians, namely that there was a double fulfilment of the Scripture prophecies, the first almost immediately after the prophecy was uttered, the second later and more fully in Christ, he, in fact, denied that Christ was the Messiah. The prophecies, he said, having an almost immediate fulfilment, could only be realized in Christ allegorically or figuratively and it was plain that such a fulfilment he regarded as absurd. A prophecy to him was simply a prediction. The cold rationalism of the Deist comes out in what is possibly the most significant passage in the whole of Deist literature. 'To suppose that an author has but one meaning at a time to a proposition (which is to be found out by a critical examination of his words) and to cite that proposi tion from him, and argue from it in that one meaning, is to proceed by the common rules of grammar and logick.'1 Applicable to scientific writings, this approach would rule out the vast body of artistic literature, all poetry, and it certainly would not apply to Scripture. He, in the Scheme Scheme of Literal Prophecy and the Letter to Dr. Rogers, gave his own beliefs on Natural Religion. They were similar to those of Matthew Tindal. The Natural Law he regarded as basic, the measure by which Christianity should be judged, and Christianity but a republication of that Law.2 Religion, he said, was a personal affair, for which man was personally answerable to God alone. The Natural Law could be en forced by the magistrate,3 and if religion were regarded as a personal affair, in which each man reached his own conclusions by means of his own reason, the result would be 'a greater agreement, a greater and better Catholicism'. 'If men were not, as they are now, conducted by others ... they would hardly fail of agreeing in the most fundamental and obvious truths of religion.'4 To the Deists human reason was supreme; by it could be demonstrated the existence and attributes of God and all the fundamental truths of religion ; religion could not rise above the level of human reason; and reason meant, in practice, ratiocination. David Hume's approach to religion was not that of the Deists. He was sceptical about the possible achievements of human reason.5 1 A.

Its origin was the propensity to believe in 'invisible, intelligent power'. And this propensity, which he describes as universal or almost universal, is a basic fact of human nature. Morover, he was forced to the conclusion that popular religion, and by this term he meant the religion of the generality of mankind, as distinct from the 'genuine theism' of the few, would not be destroyed by argument and that very frequently this would be true, not only in the case of the masses, but also in that of men whose intelligence and integrity he respected.1 Religion was, in other words, not a product of ratiocination. It corresponded to something other in human nature.2 What he might consider its ill features he might regret, but he could not explain them away. His view of nature was very different from that of the Deists. This problem he attempted to face in the Natural History of Religion. Moreover, his own religious development had not been a smooth and simple process. Born a Calvinist—a fact that, considering the nature of the Scottish Calvinism of that time, would help to explain the part that fear was to play in his explanation of religion—as a child he seems to have had a pious or perhaps a scrupulous inclination. He told Boswell, at the end of his life, that he used to read the anonymous seventeenth century religious work The Whole Duty of Man, made a list of the cata logue of vices at the end of the book, 'leaving out murder and theft and such vices as he had no chance of committing, having no inclination to commit them', and examined his conscience by it. In the same interview he said that 'he had never entertained any belief in religion since he began to read Locke and Clarke'.3 The reading of the Boyle Lectures had had a similar but less enduring effect on Benjamin Franklin.4 Hume, strange infirmities of human understanding even its most perfect state, . . in the section On the Sceptical or Academical Philosophy, part iii.

Writing to Gilbert Elliot of Minto in March 1751, on the subject of his Dialogues Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, he gave a more accurate account. He wanted Elliot to suggest arguments to strengthen the case of the theist Cleanthes. He wrote: 'any propensity you imagine I have to the other side, crept in upon me against my will; and 'tis not long ago that I burnt an old manuscript book, wrote before I was twenty; which con tained, page after page, the progress of my thoughts on that head. It began with an anxious search after arguments, to confirm the common opinion; Doubts stole in, dissipated, return'd, were again dissipated, return'd again; and it was a perpetual struggle of a restless imagination against inclination; perhaps against reason.'1 The Dialogues were written in the 1750s, received a revision in 1761 and final additions just before Hume's death. His other important work on religion, The Natural Natural History of Religion, was published in 1757. The latter is what its title suggests, not anti-religious propaganda, although it contained a good deal that was critical of religion or, as Hume termed it, 'popular religion', but a natural history, in the eighteenth-century style, intended to explain the irreducible phenomenon of religion. The former is the exposition of Hume's own position. In his letter to Elliot he described Cleanthes as the hero of the work, but it is clear that he associated him self with the sceptic Philo. But it would seem correct to hold, with Jeffner, that all three characters represent part of Hume's position.2 In the passage quoted Hume implied that Cleanthes's position had been near what had once been his own. If Cleanthes's arguments were made to appear less telling, it was not because Hume wanted to discredit him, but because he thought them less effective. And it was Hume's habit, in for example the last chapter of his Inquiry concerning Human Under standing,standing, to develop the full strength of sceptical arguments and then qualify them. The Dialogues are an argument that had gone on within Hume's own mind. And his attitude was very far from that of the Deists. The centre of the Deist position was that reason can demonstrate the existence and attributes of God and that every man can, by using his reason, work out his own religious duties towards both God and man, religion being equated with morality. It was the dogmatist Demea who advanced the proof from reason of God's existence. This was a proof from causality. It was Cleanthes and not Philo who replied to him.3 1 The Letters of David Hume, ed.

Nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradic tion.1 We can conceive any being as not existing. Therefore it cannot be demonstrated that there is a necessary being. It is Hume's usual line of argument. Reason, therefore, could not be used to demonstrate the existence of God. It is worth noting, however, that Philo had said that the existence of God is unquestionable. 'Nothing exists without a cause; and the original cause of this universe (whatever it be) we call God; and piously ascribe to him every species of perfection.'2 But he went on to say that we should not conclude that the attributes of this cause 'have any resemblance to these qualities'—wisdom, thought, knowledge— 'among men'.2 Hume denied the metaphysical principle of causality, but he did not deny causality itself. His point of view was brought out in a letter that was probably written to John Stewart, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh. '1 have never asserted so absurd a proposition as that anything might arise without a cause; I only maintained that our certainty of the Falshood of that proposition proceeded neither from intuition nor from demonstration; but from another source. That Caesar existed, that there is such an island as Sicily; for these proposi tions, I affirm, we have no demonstrative nor intuitive proof. Would you affirm that I deny their truth or even their certainty ? There are many different kinds of certainty.'3 The certainty in this case came, he held, from custom or habit derived from experience. It is interesting to com pare this passage with one from Tillotson, 'Is Mr. S. sufficiently assured that there is such a part of the world as America ? And can he demon strate this to any man without carrying him thither?... We can have no demonstrations for these things, and we expect none; because we know the things are not capable of it ... It is possible the sun may not rise tomorrow morning, and yet, for all this, I suppose no man hath the least doubt but that it will.'4 This latter was the very example given by Hume in his Treatise on Human NatureJ Both men belonged to an 1 Dialogues on Natural Religion, part ix; bound in Treatise, ii, p. 432. 2 Ibid., ii, p. 391. 3 The Letters of David Hume, i, p. 187, Hume to John Stewart, Feb. 1754.

O'HIGGINS empirical tradition but the difference is that, whereas Tillotson would derive his non-demonstrative conclusions from reason, which he would regard as a faculty working on experience, Hume's attitude is summed up in the sentence: 'All our reasonings concerning causes and effects are deriv'd from nothing but custom; and belief is more properly an act of the sensitive, than of the cogitative part of our natures.'1 Tillotson used his theory of certainty against atheism, arguing that because we have not a mathematical proof of God's existence it does not follow that it cannot be held with certainty.2 Hume was to say that in spite of the arguments of the sceptics against the reliability of reason or the senses we are not obliged to live our lives in a continual state of doubt. '1 have already shewn', he wrote, 'that the understanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general principles, entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any proposition, either in philosophy or common life . . . Most fortunately it happens, that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose ... I dine, I play a game of back gammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends; and when I wou'd return to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strain'd, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any further.'3 The needs of life, in fact, for all practical purposes, destroy scepticism. Why, however, did he not apply this same method to the proof of the existence of God and produce, not a metaphysical, but an empirical proof based, not, as that of Cleanthes, on the argument from order, but on his practical certainty with regard to causality ? The fact was that in the Dialogues he faced this problem. 'In vain', says Cleanthes, 'would the sceptic make a distinction between science and common life, or between one science and another ... And shall Philo, a man of so liberal a genius affords us.' He divides 'human reason into three kinds; viz. that from knowledge, from proofs and from probabilities'. The examples given he regards as 'proofs' i.e. 'those arguments, which are derived from the relation of cause and effect, and which are entirely free from doubt and uncertainty'. 1 Treatise, i, p. 475 (Bk. I. iv. i). 2 Cf. Works, seventh edition (London, 1714), Preface, p. iii and Sermon I. The The Wisdom of being Religious. He held that it is most likely (his own words) that creation by God is the explanation of the world; that theism is very credible and atheism incredible—a result of examining probabilities. The argument from order and, in so far as he used it, the argument from causality, he regarded as advancing difficulties that made atheism incredible. The 'external and visible effects', he said, 'our reason tells us must be attributed to some cause' and 'we cannot without violence to our understandings attribute them to any other cause but such a Being as we conceive God to be'. This conclusion, he said, was not a mathematical demonstration, but we have 'as great assurance that there is a God as the nature of the thing to be proved admits of.

I. iv. vii.</page><page sequence="19">HUME AND THE DEISTS 497 and extensive knowledge, entertain any general undistinguished scruples with regard to the religious hypothesis, which is founded on the simplest and most obvious arguments . . .?1י Cleanthes's arguments were empirical. They were the commonest religious arguments of the time, those based on design. Hume replied precisely to this argument. If we come across a man-made machine, he said, we reasonably argue to its artificer, as we have repeated experience of both men and man-made machines; but 'we have no experience of divine attributes and opera tions',2 and the machine in question—the universe—if it can be called a machine, about which he has some doubt, is unique. Its creation is something which has not come within our experience. 'Have worlds ever been formed under your eye ?',3 he asked Cleanthes. In other words while we can apply the common sense engendered by everyday ex perience to dispel scepticism with regard to our own reason, we cannot apply it in this unique case. Demea and Philo join forces to declare the incomprehensibility of the Divine perfections and Cleanthes is forced by Hume into anthropomorphism. When Cleanthes says of the world that 'it is still the image of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects', Philo replies, 'Add, a mind like a human.' '1 know of no other', says Cleanthes. 'And the liker the better', insists Philo. 'To be sure', says Cleanthes.4 These words were put into his mouth by Hume, but he considered them the logical conclusion of that school of thought which he was representing under the guise of Cleanthes. And, as we have seen, it can be regarded as a fair comment on the Deist position. God's intellect, in their opinion, is like ours, though they would have jibbed at saying 'the liker the better' if by this had been meant equally limited. Hume's God, therefore, is utterly unlike man, and most of all unlike —and here again he would differ from the Deists—with regard to the moral qualities. This was a conclusion he reached from studying the problem of evil. 'We have no more reason to infer, that the rectitude of the Supreme Being resembles human rectitude than that his benevolence resembles the human',5 a sentiment enormously remote from that of Anthony Collins when he was, for example, quoting Tillotson on our ideas of the goodness of God. Moreover, the acknowledgement of the existence of some creative force has no bearing on morals or the conduct of human life. At the very end of the Dialogues, in a passage that was probably added towards the end of his life, Hume gives what would 1 Dialogues, part i, in Treatise, ii, p. 387. 2 Ibid., p. 391; Dialogues, part ii. 3 Ibid., p. 400; Dialogues, part ii. 4 Dialogues, part i, in Treatise, ii, p. 412; Dialogues, part v. 5 Ibid., pp. 452-3; Dialogues, part xi.

O'HIGGINS seem to be almost certainly his own opinion; 'If the whole of Natural theology... resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous proposition . . . that the cause or causes of order in the universe prob ably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence ... if it affords no inference that affects human life ... and if the analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence ... if this really be the case, what can the most inquisitive, contemplative and religious man do more than give a plain, philosophical assent to the proposition ... and believe that the arguments, on which it is established, exceed the objections, which lie against it?'1 This comes at the end of the section which began with a restatement, by Philo, of the argument from design. But it is an argument which involved causality and, therefore, in Hume's opinion, comes from the sensitive rather than the cogitative parts of our nature. As Cleanthes had asked, in an earlier part of the work, 'Tell me from your own feeling, if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation ?2י Neither the manner of argument nor the conclusion, with regard either to God or to morality, is one with which the Deists would have agreed. Hume had still got to explain the phenomenon of religion. This he attempted in his Natural History of Religion. At first sight the Natural History History seems to read like a Deist Tract, with its ridiculing of super stition, which it equates with most forms of religion, and of what Hume considered to be scholastic absurdities, and with its emphasizing the element of terror in religious belief and its lack of conformity to 'sound reason'. However Hume's account of the origin of religion is very different from that of the Deists. It arises, he says, not from reason con templating nature but from the passions; in the vast majority of men not from the 'calm' passion of 'speculative curiosity' but from 'the ordinary affections of human life'.3 To base religion on the passions is not, from Hume's point of view, necessarily to criticize it. Morality itself, says Hume, arises from senti ment, not from reason—another point of difference from the Deists. ,Reason is', he wrote, ,and ought to be only the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.'4 A peculiar feeling of approbation and disapprobation tells us what is good and bad. Reason only judges on circumstances. Now religion, he held, is not a primary instinct. It is secondary. Man, he says, is ,placed in this world as in a great theatre, where the true springs and causes of 1 Treatise, ii, p. 467; Dialogues, part xii. 2 Ibid., pp. 402-3; Dialogues, part iii. 3 Essays, ii, pp. 315-16; Natural History of Religion, sect. ii. 4 Treatise, ii, p. 195 (Bk. II. ill. iii).</page><page sequence="21">HUME AND THE DEISTS 499 every event are entirely concealed from us'.1 But men feel themselves influenced by these 'unknown causes', and by the passions of hope and gratitude but more especially by that of fear they are led through their imagination to 'labour to form some particular and distinct idea of' these causes. They personify them. 'There is an universal tendency', he says, 'among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves.'2 Again one should remember that the term 'imagination' was not necessarily used by Hume in a contemptuous sense. Our belief in the continued existence of the external world is due, he held, to our imagination.3 Now the normal result of the use of the imagination in religious affairs, he says, is not monotheism but polytheism, as the unknown causes are ap parently not one but many. Only the rare philosopher, moved, no doubt, by the passion of speculative curiosity, and, it would seem, reflecting on the element of design in nature, reaches what Hume calls genuine theism—a belief in a single intelligent creator. And even here, on Hume's principles, he would not reach demonstrative certainty. His religious position would be, in fact, that of Cleanthes in the Dialogues and still, bearing in mind the Dialogues, anthropomorphic, though not in as gross a form as would be the religion of the common man. Mono theism as a popular religion arose, Hume held, again out of fear, out of a desire to placate the most powerful of the unknown causes by way of adulation. 'While they confine themselves to the notion of a perfect being, the creator of the world, they coincide by chance, with the prin ciples of reason and true philosophy; though they are guided to that notion, not by reason, of which they are in a great measure incapable, but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar superstition.'4 This is a picture very different from that drawn by Tindal in his Christianity as as Old as the Creation. The philosophic theists are led to join forces with popular monotheism, but, in Hume's opinion, with disastrous results. 'Philosophy will soon find herself very unequally yoked with her new associate; . . . All popular theology, especially the scholastic, has a kind of appetite for absurdity and contradiction. If that theology went not beyond reason and common sense, her doctrines would appear too easy and familiar.'5 And yet Hume has to admit that men whom he respects, such as Locke, Newton, and Clarke, 'were very sincere in the creed which they professed'.6 He castigates both intolerance, to which he considers monotheism is particularly susceptible, and superstition, but, unlike the 1 Essays, ii, p. 316; Natural History, sect. iii. 2 Essays, ii, p. 317; Natural History, sect. iii. 3 Treatise, i, p. 483 (Bk.

O'HIGGINS Deists, he does not lay the sole blame for such vices on priestcraft. 'The artifices of men aggravate our natural infirmities and follies of this kind, but never originally beget them. Their root strikes deeper into the mind, and springs from the essential and universal properties of human nature.'1 Hume talks of reason but his approach, to both morality and religion, was basically arational. What is his final conclusion? In the Dialogues, in philosophical de tachment, he concludes by formulating his tenuous creed, but faced with the religious phenomenon, rooted in human nature, which he views with high distaste, but which he feels it is virtually impossible to eradicate, he is thrown into some confusion. In his Treatise and in his Inquiry Inquiry concerning Human Understanding he alternated between a deep scepticism, doubt about human reason, and a robust common sense, based on human nature.2 But here human nature seems to be betraying him by what he thinks is a deep inbuilt weakness. In the final corollary to the Natural History he faces another problem. On the one hand, he sets 'the universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power', which, he says, 'if not an original instinct' is 'at least a general attendant of human nature'.3 Of the argument from design he says, 'What a noble priviledge it is of human reason to attain the knowledge of a Supreme Being; and from the visible works of nature, be enabled to infer so sublime a principle as its Supreme Creator . . . What so pure as some of the morals, included in some theological systems ?4י On the other hand, he asks: 'Examine the religious principles which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded that they are anything but sick men's dreams.'5 He returns to the problem of evil. 'Good and ill are universally intermingled and confounded; happiness and misery, wisdom and folly, virtue and vice.'6 It is a contrast presenting a question to which he finds a solution hard to discover. 'The whole', he said, 'is a riddle, an aenigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt, uncertainty, suspence of judgement appear the only result of our most accurate scrutiny, concerning this subject.'7 Yet even this is hard to sustain. 'But such is the frailty of human reason, and such the irresistible contagion of opinion, that even this deliberate doubt could scarcely be upheld; did we not enlarge our view, and opposing one species of superstition to another, set them a quarrelling; while we ourselves, during their fury and contention, happily make our escape into the calm, though obscure 1 Essays, ii, pp. 360-1; Natural History, sect. xiv. 2 Treatise, i, pp. 472-505, 544-53 (Bk.

It is an escape but not a solution. Human nature, in the great majority of mankind, remains, in his opinion, wildly aberrant and human reason, in most men, will reach no satisfactory conclusion. He admits the universal propensity to believe in invisible intelligent power. He seems to accept the argument from design as one that cannot be rejected, once it is proposed to 'anyone of good understanding'.2 But what he was to say in the Dialogues on Natural Religion casts doubt upon his acceptance of this argument. His true position can perhaps best be seen in his letter to Gilbert Elliot. 'The propensity of the mind towards it'—Cleanthes's argument—'unless that propensity were as strong and universal as that to believe in our senses and experience will still, I am afraid, be esteemed a suspicious foundation . . . We must endeavour to prove that this propensity is somewhat different from that to find our own figures in the clouds, our face in the moon, our passions and senti ments even in inanimate matter.'3 These were almost the words with which, in the Natural History, he had spoken of man's tendency to personify the hidden powers.4 The tendency to believe in invisible intelligent power he did regard as universal, but not in the form it took in Cleanthes. But it would seem clear from his letter that he had doubts about the belief even in what he would consider to be its more reason able form and from the Dialogues that he rejected it. He still felt 'the frailty of human reason' and the 'irresistible contagion of opinion' and he took refuge in Philo's declaration of belief. This certainly was an 'obscure region of philosophy'. It was very far from the self-confident and rationalistic certainty of the English Deists. J. O'Higgins J.
