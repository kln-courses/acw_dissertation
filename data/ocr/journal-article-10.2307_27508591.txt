<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sydney Labour History Group : What Rough Beast? The State and Social Order in Australian History. George Allen and Unwin, Sydney, 1982. pp. 282. $22.50 cloth, $9.95 paper. The success of the Australian Society for the Study of Labour History's special publications project is already evidenced by four fine collections of essays and by Wendy Lowenstein's Under the Hook. The appearance of What Rough Beast? adds another important volume of essays to this shelf. An indi cation of the growing interest of historians in the role of the state in capitalist society, its authors demonstrate that rich veins of material are available in Australian history to test both the familiar hypotheses of pluralist and in strumentalist theories and also those developed more recently by writers such as Poulantzas, Althusser and Balbus in the course of investigations into the state's extent and its 'relative autonomy'. What Rough Beast? is geographically limited, concentrating on the eastern states, but topically diverse. Because its authors share a common orientation toward social history the volume contains no material representative of what might be termed 'legal-economic' history. Consequently, the evidence upon which most of the essays rely is drawn from fields of inquiry which should be familiar to Australian social historians: immigration (Paula Hamilton), Aborigines (Anne Curthoys), sexuality and patriarchalism (Mark Finnane), family and marital relationships (Judith Allen, Susan Tiffen), adolescence (John Shields), crime and insanity (Stephen Garton). In each case the author focuses on the state's attempts to resolve a particular problem of social order ing. Other contributors address the state's role through analysis of more overtly conflictful episodes?the suppression of the IWW during World War I (Verity Burgmann) and the Victorian police strike of 1923 (Andrew Moore). Finally, 129</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews John Docker attempts a wide-ranging analysis of the international crisis of classical liberal hegemony which occurred at the end of the nineteenth century and of the varied responses of Australian intellectuals to that crisis over the succeeding 40 years. Notwithstanding its considerable promise, particularly the encouragement its empirical content offers to those who may be planning to develop and/or test social scientific hypotheses through investigation of specifically Australian socio-legal phenomena, What Rough Beast? suffers from a number of serious defects. The first is a problem of function. If the intent of the volume is to provide a theoretical definition of the state which is of use to historians?to test empirically a number of alternatives and to offer conclusions as to their explanatory force and coherence?then it clearly fails. Each author has her own idiosyncratic approach, not all bother even to make their hypotheses explicit and, apart from a commitment to Marxism, no collective conclusion emerges. Perhaps there is virtue in diversity, as the introduction claims, but it is hard to see how the authors could have hoped that the 'more adequate historical theory of the state' which they wish to see established would emerge from such a pot-pourri as this. In short, the interrogative in the title is not answered. A second and related problem is that the theoretical apparatus of most of the individual contributions is inadequately developed. Some authors seem entranced by the anthropomorphism of that collective title. For them the state has opinions and beliefs; it thinks, decides, acts (see the essays by Curthoys, Tiff en and, in particular, Burgmann). Introductory disclaimers notwithstand ing, such writing conveys the impression that the state is a humanoid monolith. Other essays simply demonstrate that at present their authors altogether lack access to a body of theory which would allow them fully to exploit what is undeniably fascinating material. The piece by Moore is in this category. A few, however, are much more satisfying. Allen, for example, shows consider able sophistication in her analysis of the range of conflicts and ideologies which existed within the state in late nineteenth and early twentieth century New South Wales. So do Finnane and, less consistently, Garton in handling the absolutely crucial question of the extent to which the state has institutionalised boundaries. Despite its overall defects, the collection achieves much which is of im portance to the further development of a historiography of the state in Aus tralia. It provides historians with at least the beginnings of a definition of the Australian state which includes much more than just the usual and obvious public agencies; and it also provides them with some examples of modes of analysis which can accommodate the contradictions existing in profusion within this extended state. Finally it demonstrates that the legal and institutional phenomena out of which the state is constructed are vulnerable to historicist criticism. Two other features of the book deserve brief comment. Unfortunately it is marred by an unusually large number of typographical errors. On the other hand, it is graced with an unusually thorough index.
