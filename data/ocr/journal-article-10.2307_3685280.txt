<plain_text><page sequence="1">Epistimocritique: A Synthetic Matrix Paul A. Harris THIS ESSAY ASSEMBLES A SYNTHETIC MATRIX around the term Epistimocritique in order to set out several problems, issues and categories that explore its possibilities, potential methods, and proper domains. I center the analysis around the schematic framework of a matrix to collide two modes of procedure: to delineate the underlying principles of space, time and the subject according to an overtly structural analysis, and then to fold this analysis back on itself, so that from the matrix a texture emerges. Texture here stands for what is irreducible to system, to grammar, perhaps even to language; a moment or site where the code becomes self-referen- tial, opaque, an overly dense composite of possible trajectories; where discontinuous digital algorithm slides into continuous, qualitative analog. The matrix may be represented by the simple plan of its components, below. The larger purpose in laying out this schema is to set up a network in which other routes could be pursued, other connections traversed, and substitutions made freely. The matrix is synthetic in two senses: it gestures toward totality, a synthesis, yet remains only a (synthetically) manufac- tured texture, subject to reworkings. The matrix metaphor thus collides not only two modes of procedure, but two notions of system: on the one hand, the system of philosophy, defined by propositions, rules, and the synthesis of perception in the idea; on the other, a dynamic system governed by the properties of chaos, that evolves as a thickly braided bundle of possible trajectories. I do not seek to replace the former with the latter, but to cross over from one to the other. The rubrics across the columns of the matrix are merely convenient names taken from the 1992 conference title, "Epistemocritique et Cogni- tion." My method will be to work down column I, explicating theoretical notions, and then work out these ideas in terms of textual theory (Critique) and an encounter with one text (Cognition), Don DeLillo's The Names.

Fractal Object The space in which this operation unfolds, as well as the spatial con- figuration of objects in the matrix, is defined by a topological phase space found in a variety of current discourses. Three properties of fractals bear emphasis. First, fractals are discontinuous, composed of points. Yet despite this discontinuity, fractal shapes resemble a continuous liquid form. They always appear to be melting, transforming into self-similar iterations of themselves. Third, fractals are scaling objects, that is, they retain self- similarity across different scales. 2. Interlaced Space(s) This notion of the fractal determines the status of "the subject" in relation to space. Space is usually construed as external to the subject and the body-image. While daily habits of thought and movement through the physical object world figure space as the container of that projected self, the body actually functions at a constantly shifting intersection of several spatialities. We may imagine how the fractal conceptual model accom- modates this condition in pragmatic terms: the way that we can move around across scales inside a fractal creates the impression of an interlacing of space, of the interior stretching of space; we enter into a multilevelled domain that seems to be a surface. Space ceases to have a Cartesian, con- tainer-like quality; it flows across all scales, spinning out to the cosmos or centripetally into our bodies. Perhaps this proliferation of spaces explains why cultural critics such as Baudrillard (1983) and Jameson (1992) emphasize the invasion of space SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="3">A Synthetic Matrix 187 into the subject. Their narratives of the implosion of space within the sub- ject may be situated within a wider cultural phenomenon: the mapping of spaces across vastly differing scales, from genetic mappings at the microbiological scale to tracking the large-scale flow of galaxies at the cosmological level (Hall 1992). We thus experience a double effect: scaling uproots us from our anthropomorphic anchoring in the scale of our bodies, while mapping vastly different magnitudes of space stretches the spatial orders of this phenomenon. 3. Visualized Interiors The shift in perspective, or rather the way in which perspective is rendered dynamic, induces a fundamental reconsideration of "space," not only because a scaling space stretches the microscopic and cosmological limits of space, but also because, through the computer, phenomena across all scales of space may be turned into data given visual expression. Thus on the one hand there is a visual display of quantitative information; on the other, these images place on display the innermost domains of the human, including the neocortex, the genetic code, and various receptors in the brain. The external representation of internal territories has the uncanny effect that we are both exposed to others and transparent to ourselves, an uncanniness that produces the agitated, perhaps nostalgic retreats of critics like Jameson and Baudrillard. To come to terms with this situation, rather than recalling the metaphors of the schizo or the switching network, we may recall Roger Caillois's discussion of mimicry. In the mimicry process, the organism effaces the traces of differentiation from its environment, creating a kind of trompe l'oeil that results in what Caillois terms "deper- sonalization by assimilation to space" (26). In Until The End of the World, Wim Wenders represents the mimicry process as a mapping of the private space of dreams. Wenders used a video-computer device called SDTV to encode home movies taken from the lead characters' childhoods onto computer screens; he then superim- posed several layers of information, seen as washes of color and distortion, over the original movies. These home movies represent the dreams of characters; the characters then grow addicted to watching their own dreams. At the sight of their own most intimate realm, then, people become zombies, depersonalized by their assimilation to a space that expresses the ecology of their psyche.

Surface-Depths We arrive at a seemingly debilitating juncture, where the subject is assimilated into space, where an uncanny visual representation of their own interior absorbs the viewer, where the distinction between organism or system and environment breaks down. However, this stage is not static, for it induces the next transformation. The next step is to recognize that the spatial representation, while indeed a pure surface, harbors a multivalent depth. This depth comes in the form of self-embedded, discontinuous levels, as in Wenders's layers of information swimming over an image, or the self-similar levels within a fractal. The surface, then, is actually an agglomerate, a series of self-embedded surfaces, each produced by bundles of trajectories. The perceptual space, the surface, becomes a conceptual space, a many-dimensional phase-space. We no longer inhabit a fixed ex- ternal surface that mirrors us back to ourselves; we are set in motion, scaling the spatial dimensions that extend inward and outward at the same time. 5. Surface-Incursions (Space and Language) If we pause for a moment in this flight through fractal space, we realize that we face a new dilemma: rather than being transfixed by as- similation to space, we are now in a freefall through scales that extend infinitely in any direction. How then, given the vertiginous effect of traversing scales of dizzyingly different magnitude, does one anchor oneself in this space? What language roots us in this space-a space where the wrong language becomes sheer noise, a trail of nonsense characters spewing across a computer screen? One desires, in such a landscape, to etch a mark on one step in the discrete sequence, in order to halt the flow or distinguish one place from another. We might think of this effect in discourse as incursions in or on space. We witness, in other words, a historical shift in the relation between language and space: discourse no longer traces an itinerary (following Serres [1982], discours et parcours) that weaves together subjectivity and culture, as, for example, in the Odyssey. If, as Serres asserts, "the semiotic is above all a topology" (1977: 179; his emphasis), then the linkage between language and space must change in accordance with the emergence of new topologies. In our fractal scaling space, the space/language relation is marked by a sequence of incursions of discourse on space: the signifier SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="5">A Synthetic Matrix 189 turns material, etched to a spot. If the place where space and language connect to one another is called "home," then the problem is no longer that we have to complete a journey to get home, but that we must halt the flight through a potentially infinitely regressive space to create a home. 6. Surface-Recursions (the Time of Space) And now at this juncture we seem to arrive at a fragmentation of both the subject and language in tattered space. If we picture this situation in our imagination, language appears scattered onto space in a style reminis- cent of pointillism. However, this image is still incomplete, for it lacks the element of time. Time has lost its itinerary, its linear, continuous, coherent character, but it reappears in two forms: the iterations, the orbits traced by discrete values of points, and the movement across scales. The now virtual- ly standard claim that postmodern space subsumes time (see Jameson 1992, Hayles 1990) cannot "see" time because, paradoxically, our visual displays let us literally see time in a different form. Time is no longer an internal, "subjective" process, but the dynamic immanent to spatial trajec- tories. From this perspective, the spatial metaphors for time evoke a motion through a multidimensional, computer-generated space, as if we move through some virtual reality. Yet to describe fractal time this way is decep- tive, for motion and thus change manifest themselves not as a trajectory but as iterations of the fractal configuration, as shifts in the contours of the topology. Temporality is mapped by a dynamic map, a process of "time- lapse cartography" (Hall 1992: 13). Or, as science-fiction author and graphic artist Herbert W. Franke puts it, with this type of imagery "the time dimension has been unlocked for pictures" (181). Time takes on a topological texture, with both an internal and external aspect. Temporality is an iterative process that generates shifting parameters and movements across scales through the interior of the virtual object; simultaneously, that "internal time" (Prigogine and Stengers 1984) expresses itself in external form in a visual display as a bundle of trajec- tories. We arrive at a contrast between Bergsonian, psychological, or phenomenological time-time as a continuous heterogeneity-and the ex- ternal time projected on a surface: a discrete continuity, a sequence of recursive operations. "Time" now carries with it a dual aspect: the incur- sions that characterize the relation of language to space, the discrete steps of each iteration; and the folding of these iterations through recursion. If SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="6">190 Paul A. Harris incursion marks linkages between language and space, then recursion produces the time that traces the subject's pathways on the landscape. 7. The Combinatoric Subject What, then, could we mean in evoking "the subject"? The continuity of Bergsonian time guaranteed the identity, the presence of the subject. But once time becomes a sequence of recursive operations or a movement across different scales, the stability of the continuous is undermined by the co-presence of a fundamental discontinuity. The subject then has a provisional or processual existence; it is the product of a differential, a difference located at the seam dividing the purely discrete from the smoothly continuous. The subject emerges as a fluctuating, meta-stable entity whose contours change as discrete components are shuffled through different combinations and into different configurations. It is memory that re-reroutes seemingly discrete experiences or impressions into recursively connected loops. The incomputable, unknowable totality of possible con- figurations that comprises one's life is like a sprawling fractal, and one's own self-knowledge and the events in one's life take shape as routes one may follow through the fractal. Fractals provide an efficient metaphor for this idea of the subject be- cause they are structures without a center; they offer an image of form that remains inextricably bound to its formative process. The appeal of drawing on fractal form as a metaphor for subjectivity is seen in Lyotard's formula- tion: "Thoughts are clouds. The periphery of thoughts is as immeasurable as the fractal lines of Benoit Mandelbrot" (1988: 5). This "immeasurable periphery" retains the dual qualities of jaggedness, discontinuity (at a single scale, within a given series) and continuity (in the self-similarity of form across scale). Thought processes are discrete, punctuated by ruptures, fissures; yet at a different scale (of the whole) they also take on a distinct shape of their own. We have shifted from Bergson's stream of consciousness as the basis of duration to a bank of clouds, carried by the wind, forming through chaotic convections. Lyotard extends his fractal thought metaphor to a definition of time: As postponement itself, time does not allow the full synthesis of the mo- ments or positions the mind crossed through in approaching a cloud of thoughts ... Time is what blows a cloud away after we believed it was SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="7">A Synthetic Matrix 191 correctly known and compels thinking to start again on a new inquiry, which includes the anamnesis of former elucidations. (7) Lyotard's notion of anamnesis marks time as a looping, self-referential process: a movement both forward and wrapping around itself. At the moment where looping back through returns to itself, we have not a coin- ciding of paths, which would bespeak the full presence of consciousness to itself; rather, as Peter Nicholls expresses it, we have "not a dialectical move toward synthesis but rather an internal displacement-spatial and tem- poral-against a system of meanings" (5). Epistemocritique, then, may be mapped out according to a systemic analysis; however, this system includes its self-referential capacity, the ability to turn its own code opaque and break out into a different itinerary altogether. Categories belonging to systematic philosophy, including time, space, and the subject, are recuperated in this form of analysis not as fixed or metaphysical entities, but as metastable conceptual categories that pro- vide a point of departure. II. CRITIQUE - III. COGNITION My next loop through the matrix moves across its remaining columns: it traces connections among these theoretical notions (I), an idea of the text as matrix (II), and Don DeLillo's The Names (III). I filter the notion of text back through the theoretical categories I have set out above, and then develop a brief reading of DeLillo's novel in keeping with this approach to textuality. 1. Fractal Object/Text-Matrix The text as matrix has the features of a linguistic analogue to the combinatoric subject. The text-matrix differs from how one pictures a mathematical matrix in that one should imagine the text-matrix combining components with one another across fractal dimensions; the matrix serves as a convenient metaphor for a cognitive process (reading) irreducible to schematic representation. Here critical discourse posing as a metalanguage becomes particularly cumbersome, for to imagine textual components combining with each other already places us in a phenomenological realm where there exists a separate reader who performs these operations with the text. In this ecol- SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="8">192 Paul A. Harris ogy we rather submit a fractal textual object to an incessant reshuffling process; the reader becomes an anachronism, a literary ghost of Maxwell's Demon, immanently located as a recursive processor of time and informa- tion. Stanislaw Lem (1987) imagines that conceptual ecologies may be modelled as topological spaces. Because a given topology places con- straints on the range of forms that may emerge without predicting which ones will take shape, topology allows one to map developments in com- plex systems such as a text. A topological ecology of reading would model textual forms as melting motions within a guiding fractal configuration. The act of reading is refigured as scaling the virtual realities that emerge at the interpenetrations of reader and text. The work, conceived as a human technology for organizing and processing poetic language in time, is a matrix through which the retrodictive events of the past recursively flow into a multidimensional present. The chaotic web on interconnections that emerge in this present indicate that once we introduce "information" into a human or textual processor, information loses its strictly digital under- pinnings. As William Paulson argues (1988), poetic language is com- munication that is extremely difficult to encode as information. While one may draw on topology to model the text-matrix, it is impor- tant not to take the fractal metaphor as a reductive or static formalism. We should rather take the fractal metaphor more radically, keeping in mind that the text traverses many levels of reality, at least in a virtual sense. That is, the geographical, physical spaces depicted in the text take shape for a reader, to the point that simulated places materialize for a moment. Don DeLillo's The Names may serve as a model of a text that, within its virtual text-space, keeps moving across topological, textual, architectural, and archaeological spaces. Tom LeClair has written that The Names in its structure and form, is like a veiled Venn diagram, composed of multi- ple crossed hemispheres [i.e., hemispheres of both the earth and the brain], overlapping loops .. . of action, setting, and time, [. . . and] the ongoing, shifting relations among the novel's components, (1987: 179). To trace the combinatorics in DeLillo's book, we must become like certain of its characters who sift through archaeological clues to reconstruct a culture's story. In working our way through The Names, we become like the character Texier, an archaeologist "working backwards through curves of time, arc after arc of fragments set on the ground around his chair" (De- Lillo 149). The way that the reader's perspective identifies with those of charac- ters is mirrored by the reverse fact that DeLillo's first-person narrator in SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="9">A Synthetic Matrix 193 The Names is himself in the position of a "reader" who attempts to process temporal events and information. James Axton's occupation as a "risk analyst" already puts him in the position of an archaeologist of the geopolitical present: from his home base in Athens, he uses bank state- ments, newspapers, military intelligence and personal contacts to calculate the risks multinational corporations take in sending money and/or execu- tives to different countries in the world. Much of the novel recounts Axton's friendships with Americans in Athens involved with multination- al corporations. At the same time, the narrative is retrospective; the book is also Axton's attempt to use memory and narrative to make sense of his emotional failures, his broken marriage and his tenuous relationship with his son Tap. And so just as I am treating the novel form as a processor of past information that opens up a multidimensional present, Axton's narra- tive seeks to become a Durcharbeitung, a working through of past events that breaks a temporal loop of debilitating repetitions. 2. Interiorized Space/Geopolitical Space Textualized I view the text-matrix as a fractal object, what David Porush (1985) calls a "soft machine," a technology enabling reader, text and cultural context to combine within an encompassing ecology. The relations among reader, text and cultural space reflect what I called "the interiorization of space" in that the boundaries among these entities are fractal: they inter- penetrate and fold through one another in complex ways unrepresentable in conventional (Euclidean) spatial terms. Thus the interactions among text, reader and context reconfigure the interiorization of space. An important dimension to this seemingly formal model is the way in which the literary work engineers a dynamic exchange in the reader be- tween cultural space and textual space. DeLillo's book is important from an ideological standpoint, because it not only depicts in some detail the struggles for geopolitical power being fought across Europe, the Baltic, and Mid-East; it also demonstrates how these power relations are, un- beknownst to him, controlling the actions taken by Axton. Axton retains a cynical detachment from his work as risk analyst, yet he discovers in the end that his company has associations with the CIA. His desire to "try to force events, to find out how complete [he is]" and his naive excitement in discovering that "we're right in the middle [of the world]," that "events have weight" (49; 98) express the faulted perception that in a geopolitical system, a single person or node has a linear, causal effect. The revelation SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="10">194 Paul A. Harris that Axton is an unwitting CIA informant reveals the gap between the level of the system and the individual experience. At the same time, however, the book's thematic concern with language and its relation to space produces a complex map whose contours keep flexibly changing, for the map results from the interactions of characters and space. In other words, there is not a static ideological determinism in DeLillo's book, where geopolitical lines of power simply subsume and dictate the internal lives of people. Instead, these lines of power, while they do determine individual subjectivities, are also rewritten by the actions taken by these same people. There emerges out of the global network a set of possibilities, a space where ethics and decisions receive a "weight" of their own, far different from the uninformed conception of the "weight of event" Axton formulates. We return then to the relationship between language and space. Exter- nal historical and geopolitical forces are fed through the matrix, while the paths these forces trace in the text etch out the textual space. Classic literary examples of the mutual influence between geographical and textual space include the hero's itinerary in the Odyssey, the catastrophic crossroads in Oedipus, or the inn where Tom Jones crosses paths with Sophia in the middle of Fielding's novel. In The Names, geographical routes and strands of plot in textual space are wrapped through one another across several levels. The multiple geographical crossings we witness through Axton's trips send out a net- work of airline connections emanating from Athens, the hub of terrorist departures-not the least of which are American forms of terror. His circle of friends become vehicles of a plot that maintains its own grammar, as stories within it develop, are dropped, and picked up again. Layers of plot are embedded within a multivalent system: These mass dinners [with Axton's friends] had shifting patterns, directional changes of conversation, and I found myself involved in an intricate cross- cut talk with the German, to my right, on air cooling, and with David Keller and Dick Borden, at the other end and other side of the table, on famous movie cowboys and the names of their horses. David was going to Beirut the next day. Charles was going to Ankara. Ann was going to Nairobi .... Stahl was going to Franfurt. Dick was going to Muscat, Dubai and Riyadh. (55) The movements in space here involve both communication and geography, and this passage shows how the book constantly traverses different scales and kinds of space. Moreover, the flat style, the deceptively matter-of-fact tone in which these facts are reported also exemplifies a different concep- SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="11">A Synthetic Matrix 195 tion of the novel form and narrative voice as a tool for exploration. The passage is an index to how DeLillo addresses complex themes such as geopolitical shifts in power, the nature of multinational corporate lives, the problems of communication posed when one's spatial life stretches so far so quickly, and so on. 3. Visualization of Space/Visual Text In moving through theoretical notions, I noted that the interiorization of space is accompanied by the visualization of new geographies, from the genome to the cosmos. The notion of a textual matrix, in which lines of relation intersect across several spatial scales and domains, has an immedi- ately visual quality, for the simple reason that re-assembling a text as a matrix brings the many kinds of spatial relations depicted in a work to the surface and thereby makes them visible. And of course, our relationship to texts, as it becomes increasingly transformed into computer spaces, takes on a more and more immediate, visual quality. Beyond this assertion about textual form, DeLillo's mode of descrip- tion in the novel often seeks to mimic the camera. Passages that record Axton's experiences in cities especially read with the neutrality and move- ment of a camera panning a scene. This stylistic device is given explicit expression through the character of the avant-garde filmmaker from Berkeley named Frank Volterra, through whom the visual representation of intimately human "spaces" becomes a crucial theme in the novel. The title of The Names refers to a cult which chooses a victim, waits for the person to wander to a place where the initials of his or her name match the initials of the name of the place, and bludgeons the person to death. The cult "creates a system equal to the terror" of death-they devise their own plot within which to contain and control death. And as soon as the territory of death is mapped in this way, there is the desire to put it on visual display. Volterra decides he wants to shoot a film of the cult, because, he says, "what they do seems so close to something on film, so natural to film ." His film is an idea they might have thought of themselves, an idea involving lan- guages, patterns, extreme forms, extreme ways of seeing .... Film is part of the 20th century mind. It's the world seen from inside. We've come to a certain point in the history of film. If a thing can be filmed, film is implied in the thing itself ... The 20th century is on film. It's the filmed century. You have to ask yourself if there's anything more important than the fact that we're constantly on film, constantly watching ourselves. (200) SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="12">196 Paul A. Harris DeLillo clearly uses Volterra to express an insight of his own here. When asked to name major influences on his work, DeLillo first mentioned Godard; this was followed by an explanation of how cinematic effects in fiction allow the space to work on characters, to reveal characters by the nature of the space in which they move (LeClair and McCaffrey, 84). Rather than conceiving of either a subject completely determined by space, or a subject as an entity separate from spatial constraints, DeLillo's concep- tion of character and setting entails an interactive relation where the char- acter both shapes the space, chooses routes through it, and is influenced and even given form by that space. 4. Surface Depths/Palimpsest Translated into textual terms, the notion of a fractal surface that har- bors self-similar depths would assume the form of an evolving text-ure of fractional dimension: a work that continually loops back through itself, that interweaves strands of narrative across an enmeshed, recursive sur- face. John Berger articulates a notion of the novel along these lines: It is scarcely possible to tell a straight story sequentially unfolding in time, because we are too aware of what is continually traversing the story lateral- ly ... instead being aware of a point as an infinitely small part of a straight line, we are aware of it as an infinitely small part of an infinite number of lines, as the centre of a star of lines. (40) Berger situates this shift in the novel in the context of global communica- tion networks and geopolitics, where "prophecy now involves a geographical rather than a historical projection; it is space not time that hides consequences from us" (ibid.). This conception of the novel and its relationship to geographies of power is borne out almost schematically in DeLillo's execution of The Names. Rather than unfolding the development of personal or political relationships over a sustained period, the book traces back through the events of a single year. But the characters and events marked in the text traverse the globe several times; sections are set in different geographies (Athens; the desert of India; the obscure, mountainous Peloponnesus, the near- and mid-East). At regular intervals, the narrative voice abruptly steps out of its present to register a sequence of global political developments (the fall of the Shah in Teheran, Iraqui unrest). More generally, the composition of the book draws attention to its palimpsest form in theme and structure alike. In theme and setting, we SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="13">A Synthetic Matrix 197 have the depths of time and the surfaces of space: DeLillo juxtaposes the geological timescales of archaeology, a stratification of histories buried in the earth, with the geographical timescales of global travel, an instan- taneous mode of movement that plunges the American into the unfamiliar, the archaic, the exotic. These several concerns are braided into a text that unfolds in discrete sections marked by simple breaks; the narrator hardly registers passing time, so that these different strands of plot (the multina- tional-corporate cast of friends in Athens, the dystopian family romance, the tracking of the cult) do not progress but layer themselves on one another--one might call this the sedimentation of the postmodern novel. 5. Surface-Incursions/Material Signs When language creates such a verbal surface, and when it seeks to both represent and traverse a global network of multiple spaces, it must compensate for this motion by making discursive incursions on space: sites where the signifier turns material, etched to a certain spot on a landscape. To function in this way, the signifier materializes when it takes on a formal opacity of its own-it ceases to signify in its usual way. This disruption, this moment of play or dMlire (Lecercle 1985) or this intrusion of the figural (Lyotard 1988), confronts the syntactic, global functioning of language as a sign-system with a local site, marked by its own strictures. This kind of linguistic site is a subtle fluctuation that enables the sign to materialize and emerge from the system, creating a noisy passage from local to global. In this context the conjunction of the archaic with the contemporary plays a special role in The Names. The cult's ritual expresses their deeper obsession with language, especially the physicality of language. The cult makes literal incursions on the landscape--attacks that join signifier to a site with the mark of death. The archaeologist Owen Brademas, as he pursues the cult through the novel, comes to share this obsession. At first Brademas deciphers stones and discovers that writing originated in the need to compile lists. His interest then shifts to the material aspect of the stones themselves, the shapes of the symbols. The materiality of the archaic signifier contrasts with the proliferation of information and resultant immaterialization of signs in contemporary culture. As risk analyst, Axton sifts through endless tables of statistics, communiques, rumors and facts to try to discern some pattern by which he can make a probabilistic calculation of danger. The masses of information, combined with how far they place the risk analyst from the real risks SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="14">198 Paul A. Harris involved, characterize Axton's cynicism, his distance from the world, his friends, and himself. The list form has fallen from simple accounting to secret global power networks, or to Axton's "27 Depravities": his list of his personal faults he compiled from fights with his wife. At the same time, as the narrative proceeds Axton turns more and more to incursions of language, to simple marks or phrases as a means to represent more complex matters. As the text proceeds, more and more memories of his marriage intrude, juxtaposed with quotations from the 27 Depravities. The shift in Axton's sense of himself from inflated, safely bounded ego to a person composed of experiences largely dictated by external constraints occurs when, walking up out of a city while waiting for a plane, he suddenly realizes that "in the reason and ease of these sweeping curves, [he's been] approaching a point all morning long" where geographical initials match those of his name. With the cult, then, Axton finds the power of linguistic incursions in space. In general, Axton comes to realize that among all the failures of his life, the cult is the one thing he connects with. 6. Surface-Recursions/Textual Loops The recursive loops that string together moments of linguistic incur- sions are very apparent in textual space. This is because a particular textual component that materializes can only do so within a topos, a field of discur- sive vectors. The nearly self-referential quality of recursion--of taking out- put as subsequent input--is intimately related to the materialization of signs, for it is when the linguistic code becomes opaque to itself, caught in self-referentiality, that language becomes material. Puns, complex metaphors and figures all retain this quality. If we consider recursive loops over the longer span of a book, they entail the many loopings across various scales that spin themselves out with the play of the text. Recursions may involve crossings in an itinerary a character follows, the reappearance of characters, the recollections of events. A member of the cult in DeLillo's book sums up the larger cultural dimensions of this perspective: ... the world has become self-referring.. .For thousands of years...the world was where we lived, the self was where we went mad and died. But now the world has made a self of its own .... This is my vision, a self-referring world, a world in which there is no escape. (297) The central conflict in The Names, Axton's journey into himself through memory and narrative, stretches over the temporal loop of one year, which SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="15">A Synthetic Matrix 199 in turn is played out on a long spatial loop in the text. Encompassing all the circlings of Axton and others in the plot is a single itinerary: Axton expres- ses his desire but inability to make his homage to the Acropolis in the first pages, and his narrative concludes with his visit there at the end. There are several interesting aspects to this recursion in the text. It shows how in global space, the itinerary is now a given; that what is needed is the discourse to complete the itinerary, to mark the space with one's own encounter. Axton's search in the book is one for a proper lan- guage, and his discovery at the Acropolis is at one level simply that "everyone is talking;" DeLillo describes how "hearing one language after another, rich, harmonious, strong," Axton realizes that "what we bring to the temple . .. is language" (331). This insight, which concludes Axton's narrative, is in itself dissatisfying-it does not pose as a culminating answer for Axton or the reader. Yet this very lack of culmination at the level of the protagonist-subject signals the crucial openendedness of the recursive loop, an openness that looks forward to a different form of lan- guage. 7. Combinatoria Subject/Textual Memory In the looping of the matrix, to work toward a conclusion is also to re-iterate one's initial steps. The theoretical column of the matrix concludes with a notion of the subject whose "identity" rests only in a constantly recombining collection of information and experience. The permutations that emerge from this multiplicity do nevertheless imbue a subject with an identifiable quality, no matter how nebulous. The same could be said for texts: that out of their operations they develop a certain quality unique to themselves, though this quality cannot be expressed in any simple way. My term for this quality is textual memory. Textual memory is, at the level of the work, analogous to the singular linguistic disturbance that disrupts the flow of the sentence, and creates an immediate, nearly uncan- ny effect. The textual memory effect is necessarily much more complex, because it emerges from the interpenetrations of text, reader and cultural context. To offer a schema of textual memory, I will sumperimpose my text-matrix model on Italo Calvino's (1970) notion of literature as a com- binatoric process: After the process of literary composition has been taken to pieces and reassembled [as a matrix], the decisive moment is bound to be in the act of reading.

Literature is a combinatoric game ... which may suddenly register an unexpected meaning: one that comes sliding down from a different level, one that is capable of bringing into play... a specific effect of one of [its] permutations on a person in their historical perspective. (96, 99-100) The specific effect Calvino notes here would be a privileged moment, a kind of clinamen in the textual system, which then reshapes the work as a whole (Harris 1990). Textual memory would be the virtual text that is projected from this momentary slippage, this uncanny friction caused at a site that traverses many levels of the human mind, many textual scales, and grafts this moment to a particular cultural moment. While the phenomenon of textual memory is produced by a human subject, it simul- taneously creates a thrust or trajectory from the subject through language onto a landscape. The concluding portions of The Names exemplify the thrust of this route in several complicated ways. Axton's search for self-realization ends in an empty, jarring fact: he has been duped in his occupation as risk analyst; the company he works for has close ties to the CIA. It is as if, in his search for a subjective agency that led him to take such an influential job, Axton's agency is illusory, playing into the hands of the Central Intel- ligence Agency. So the knowledge of himself Axton gains is negative: he feels that his cynical distance on things in fact implicates him in matters he considers distasteful, unethical. The "subject" in this text does not achieve a self-realization, he does not complete himself; rather he experiences him- self as a discontinuity, a fissure between his projected self and his acting self. Thus the closing journey to the Acropolis does not bring Axton to a final word or some crystallized knowledge of himself. It is instructive to compare this experience to Freud's "Disturbance of Memory on the Acropolis." Freud records the Entfemdungsgefuhl he felt in seeing the Acropolis, in finding "So all this really does exist, just as we had learned at school" (44). The disturbance lay for Freud in an unconscious city that had displaced the real city. This unconscious counterpart created an uncanny experience, a deja vu. The early twentieth-century archaeological digs un- derneath cities, contemporaneous with Freud's probes into the depths of the unconscious, express the modern journey through physical and psychological strata in search of archetypal depths (Kuberski 1991). Axton, by contrast, is not at all surprised by what he finds in the architecture of the Acropolis itself, for he had anticipated the "rational, timeless, pure" qualities of it, its "sacred height, intact in its Doric order." SubStance 71/72, 1993</page><page sequence="17">A Synthetic Matrix 201 But what does jolt Axton is the emotional immediacy of the Acropolis: it is "a thing ... to feel .... It wasn't a relic species of dead Greece but part of the living city below it" (330). The inverse of Freud's experience: not a deeply uncanny experience structured by an unconscious, but an emotion- al experience that feels the various spatial and temporal strata encom- passed in the view from the Acropolis as part of a many-dimensional surface. The event of the Acropolis carries no signature of ddja vu, no sense of repetition; it is rather memory on the surface, an event that brings into simultaneity a set of heterogeneous temporalities and languages. The ar- chaeology performed at the end is one, finally, of the present, and specifi- cally of the languages of the present. For Axton, this end point is rather empty. His narrative as a whole may enable him to move on in a different vein in his relationships, but this is only a debatable point at best. From within the first-person narrative, the search depicted in the book ends unfinished. But in terms of textual memory, the work is more complex. For The Names may also be read as a book about a search for a language that would restore something of the power of naming capable of making incursions on an uprooted geopolitical world, a language that points toward a future. And the text's resolution is the language that is its own "offering": just as Axton realizes that "our offering is language," the book's epilogue proffers a language with its own signature. The epilogue is a segment from Axton's son Tap's novel that depicts Owen Brademas's boyhood experience in church, where he was unable to gain the ecstasy of pentecostal speech. The boy stumbles out into a storm on the prairie, gets caked with mud; the book ends: "It was the nightmare of real things, the fallen wonder of the world" (338). At one level, the tale is a parable on the fallenness of humans and language. Yet the invented language it is told in, full of idiosyncracies that give new resonances to old words, that force us to encounter the sign as new material, is the payoff, the result of the narrative's working through its own textual memory. As Axton says, Tap's "mangled words are exhilarat- ing. He'd made them new again, made me see how they worked, what they really were. They were ancient things, secret, reshapable" (313). To risk a conclusion: DeLillo's words may serve as a metaphor for the potential of Epistemocritique. a method of reshaping the languages of cul- ture into new forms that reveal something unseen within their makeup. This method follows routes among conceptual models emerging in cultural discourses, cultural artifacts, and theoretical metalanguages.

Harris become artifacts that contain contemporary evolutions of knowledge. While my analysis here has blunted the edges, the differences among these different levels of culture, it has done so only as a preliminary conjecture. On closer inspection, the synthetic matrix will fragment into several self- contained cells, each with their own intricate internal composition. But the beauty that emerges will be of the same order; the scale alone will change. Irvine, California WORKS CITED Baudrillard, Jean. "'The Ecstasy of Communication," in Hal Foster, ed.
