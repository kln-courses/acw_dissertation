PAILIN Senior Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion, University of Manchester THE HUMANITY OF THE THEOLOGIAN AND THE PERSONAL NATURE OF GOD In his autobiographical-biographical study, Father and Son, Edmund Gosse describes how one evening, during his childhood, while his father was praying at - or, rather, over - his bed, a rather large insect dark and flat, with more legs than a self-respecting insect ought to need, appeared at the bottom of the counterpane, and slowly advanced... I bore it in silent fascination till it almost tickled my chin, and then I screamed 'Papa! Papa!'. My Father rose in great dudgeon, removed the insect (what were insects to him!) and then gave me a tremendous lecture.' I suppose one moral of this story is that we should keep our eyes shut during prayers. Then we will not see the horrors that assail us. Another, more interesting moral is that drawn by Edmund Gosse himself: The theory of extreme Puritanism can surely offer no quainter example of its fallacy than this idea that the omnipotent Jehovah could be seriously offended, and could stoop to revenge, because a little, nervous child of nine had disturbed a prayer by being frightened at a beetle.2 The moral which Edmund Gosse draws from the story highlights one fundamental characteristic of any satisfactory theology. Such a theology must not only be concerned with what may be described as ontologically, valuatively and rationally ultimate. It must also treat its object in a way that is appropriate to its ultimate status. The error of father Gosse, as seen by his son, was that his understanding of God trivialized God by ascribing to him morally questionable values and self-concern.3 Indeed, as Anselm recognized, it is not even appropriate to describe the object of religious faith as what happens in fact to be the best or the most powerful or the most wise reality. The greatest being in fact could conceivably be a cosmic Hitler. As such it would not be 'God', the proper object of worship. The object of religious faith and worship - and so the primary object of theological understanding - must be conceived in Anselm's phrase as 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived'.4 It is not simply unsurpassed in positive value by anything 1 E.

PAILIN that exists: it is essentially and necessarily unsurpassable in positive value by anything, other than later states of itself,' that could ever be coherently conceived as actual. This characteristic of an adequate theology cannot, however, avoid being in tension with another equally fundamental characteristic. Theology, as man's attempt to grasp what is ultimate, is limited to and controlled by the structures of understanding available to man. Thus while in the ordo essendi God is primary and determines all reality, in the ordo cognoscendi man is primary and man's intellectual possibilities and limitations determine what can be grasped. Theologians, therefore, who maintain that 'faith does not understand revelation in terms of human possibilities of knowledge' but 'just the contrary', do not simply prepare the ground for what Buri describes as 'irresponsible theological outrage'.2 They also, and most disturbingly, fail to recognize adequately their own inescapable humanity. When God lambasts Job for attempting to rise in understanding above his human limita tions,3 those who study theology should remember that God is here portrayed as condemning not the doubts of a philosopher but the presumptions of a believer and would-be theologian! Job's response was to fall silent: I put my finger to my lips. I have spoken once and now will not answer again; twice have I spoken, and I will do so no more.4 This response, however, is as little possible for the theologian as the presump tion which forgets the mysterious otherness of God. It is not just for economic and professional reasons that the theologian has to speak about God. Refusal to speak about God is also - and importantly - intellectually unacceptable. The question of God - as the question of what is ontologically, valuatively and rationally ultimate - is the inescapable question posed by man and to man by his consciousness of being and, in particular, of his own being. He cannot abandon the quest for understanding of the nature of and his relation ship to the ultimate ground, values, unity and goal of reality without abandoning his fundamental understanding of himself as homo sapiens. While, therefore, we may have epistemological doubts about our ability to find answers to the questions of being, we cannot, without declaring the meaning lessness of life, abandon the search for those answers. The second fundamental characteristic of theology, then, is that it is man's attempt to perceive the nature of the ultimate. Anselm indicates the 1 For the significance of this qualification, cf. Hartshorne's notion of God's perfection as 'dual transcendence', in, e.g., Logic of Perfection (Illinois: Open Court, 1962), pp. 40 if. and Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method (London: SCM Press, I970), pp. 272 if. 2 F.

' Job 40: 4 f.; cf. 42: I-6 (NEB translation).</page><page sequence="3">THE THEOLOGIAN AND THE NATURE OF GOD I43 problematic character of this task when, from the premise that God is 'that than which a greater cannot be conceived', he concludes that God is 'a being greater than can be conceived' whose 'attributes' belong to him in an 'ineffable manner'.' The corollary of this conclusion, accepting that it is valid, is not that theology is impossible in principle but that when the theologian attempts to answer the question of being in terms of God, he must remember that his understanding of God is significantly determined, both essentially and culturally,2 by his own questions and structures of understanding as a man.3 Although it is possible to speak with C. A. Campbell of 'that aura of the supra-natural, the supra-human, the supra-rational in which the numinous experience is enveloped throughout',4 such expressions do not describe what we apprehend as 'God' but provide, rather, qualifiers which remind us of the problematic anthropologicality that inescapably marks all theology as our talk about God just because it must be our talk. The little ducks who went into the ark prayed: Dear God give us a flood of water. Let it rain tomorrow and always. Give us plenty of little slugs and other luscious things to eat. Protect all folk who quack and everyone who knows how to swim.5 In the end, for all our sophisticated intellectual manceuvrings, our under standing of God may well be as anthropologically determined as that of those ducks was nettalogically (or, perhaps, nettariologically) determined! Who are we to claim a privileged status for our knowledge of God? The mention of prayer introduces the third fundamental characteristic of an adequate theology. The two characteristics of theology which we have noticed so far are basically metaphysical. Theology, however, is not just another name for metaphysics - man's attempt to perceive what is ultimate. Theology is also concerned with explicating the content and implications of religious faith. It is thus a discipline which seems to combine two apparently distinct sources of understanding - the metaphysical insights of man's 1 Anselm, Proslogion, chapter I5, I7. These conclusions did not, of course, prevent Anselm from describing the nature and attributes of God! Few theologians, indeed, who have affirmed the 'ineffability' of God have consistently followed the implications of their affirmation. 2 The qualification 'essentially' refers to what is determined by man's nature as man's while the qualification 'culturally' refers to what is determined for any particular man by his contingent cultural inheritance and situation. 3 For further on the characteristics of an acceptable theological position, cf.

PAILIN rational speculations and insights contained in his religious experience and faith. The attempt to unify these two sources of understanding is not sur prising, though, since believers affirm that in their religious faith they are in contact with, committed to and responding to the ultimate reality. Indeed, some such unification is essential if believers are not to suffer an intellectual schizophrenia. The religious element, however, reminds us that for some major groups of religious believers there is a third fundamental characteristic of theology - namely, the claim that the ultimate reality is in some appropriate and significant way to be understood as a personal reality. This claim, as I see it, distinguishes religion for these groups of believers - and so theology - from the theory and practice of a purely metaphysical understanding. It is with some of the problems of this third characteristic - and, in particular, with its relationship to the other two characteristics - that I am concerned in the rest of this paper. In brief, I want to consider whether it makes sense for us to talk of God as personal when we take seriously both the ultimacy of God and the anthropologicality of our theology. In this way, then, I want to investigate some of the implications of 'the humanity of the theologian' for the theological enterprise. The notion of God as personal, indeed, raises in an acute manner the problem of the reconciliation of the ultimate and the anthropological characteristics of theology since the notion of the 'personal' is derived from our own awareness of our personal mode of existence. Before we start the investigation proper, though, it is probably advisable to consider the assertion that religion and, therefore, theology are necessarily concerned with ultimate reality as personal - or, as it could be put, that religion is a response to and theology is about a necessarily theistic being. Such justification is needed against the charges both of those who hold that this definition wrongly excludes some faiths which are widely regarded as religious and of those who maintain that this definition improperly restricts the essence of religion to its cruder anthropomorphic forms and self understanding. In relation to the latter charge, I find it perverse to argue that the personal nature of the ultimate reality belongs only to cruder forms of religion and therefore, presumably, to forms which can be abandoned without loss, when so much of religious thought and practice apparently presupposes such a personal nature of God and would be impossible without such a pre supposition. Prayer, for example, as widely practised is not only contempla tion of, meditation on some ideals: it is in form and, I suggest, in intention personal address to a being that is expected to respond. The 'theologians of the post mortem Dei' may, as Buri puts it, consistently replace prayer with meditation but theologians of living religion must see that for many believers in practice 'the praying man has to do with a transcendence which is not</page><page sequence="5">THIE THEOLOGIAN AND THE NATURE OF GOD I45 silent but which speaks to him and hears him." The point at which prayer is wholly converted into meditation or contemplation is, for the religious belief which we are investigating, the point at which religion is converted into metaphysics, not the point at which the true essence of religion is released from misleading personal forms. These religious believers, further more, do not only pray to God but also seem to be essentially committed to holding that God 'acts' in some personal kind of way. Highly problematic as both the meaning and the justification of these claims may be, religious belief cannot, as they see it, be divorced from the use of active verbs after the noun 'God' without abandoning something crucial. God is said to save, love, create, call, judge, punish, reward. To say that these verbs reify and personify what are really impersonal forces in the ultimate structure of reality is not to clarify their meaning but to hold that the religious faith expressed by them is basically wrong and must be replaced by a funda mentally different kind of understanding. It is not, therefore, the crude, primitive forms of religion but the essence of their religion that presupposes the personal nature of God. Bertocci seems to me to sum up this personalistic religious position when he concludes his paper 'The Person God Is' with the sentence 'Only in mutual love is there that fellowship-in-creativity-with-God that is God's highest goal for himself and for every man.'2 Such love, fellow ship and creativity, however, require both men and God to be personal beings in reciprocal relationships. But while it is relatively easy to maintain that personal notions of God cannot be removed from some forms of religion without destroying their very essence, it is not so easy to show that no non-theistic faith should be classed as 'religion'. Arguments about definitions, however, are among the less useful kinds of academic conflict. In reply, then, to the charge that by holding that religion is response to a necessarily theistic being I wrongly restrict the applicability of that term, I merely want to point out, first, that the word 'religion' is so variously used that any definition of it must be stipulative to some extent - though it ought not to be tendentious; secondly, that the description 'religious' and 'non-religious' is not a basis for praise and blame and so to exclude any faith from the class of 'religion' is not in any way to condemn it. As others, however, may not want to restrict the term 'religion' so closely, I only ask that the personalistic and theistic use of the term be accepted as specifying what is at least a large group of faiths and, therefore, that my concern in this paper be recognized as dealing with the relation of the elements of ultimacy, anthropologicality and personal being that are essential to those faiths. Since on this basis I will be concerned with the basic structure of the common self-understanding of at least Judaism, Christianity I Buri, op. cit. p. 33; cf. pp. 33 f. Note the reference to Ebeling on p. 34n as 'correctly' emphasizing 'that knowledge of God "stands or falls with the possibility of prayer" (Word and Faith, p. 352) '. 2 P.

PAILIN and Islam, I do not feel my 'stipulative' definition makes my concern trivial or tendentious. This identification of 'religion' is also one in which I happily find myself in good company. C. C. J. Webb, for instance, on the basis that 'Philosophy of Religion is an attempt to understand Religion as it ... really exists', holds that, in terms of Christian insights, the 'general nature of religion' involves belief in God 'as person or spirit, existing in the completeness of a personal or spiritual nature '.' Collingwood speaks of 'the instinct of religion' as 'the deliberate procedure of philosophy at its best' when it 'demands a personal God, a God who has a definite character of his own and can ... take sides in the battles of the world' in contrast to 'a sham "philosophy".. of abstractions'.2 For Aulen the notion of personality 'brings out vividly the voluntary and active character of the idea of God'. It is thus crucially im portant since it both affirms the reality of 'the spiritual character of the relationship between God and man' and condemns 'the tendency to trans form the conception of God into an abstract idea' or 'some force of nature '.3 H. H. Farmer bluntly begins The World and God with the statement 'The conviction that God is personal, and deals personally with men and women, lies at the heart of Christian experience and thought '.4 Farmer refuses to surrender the idea because it is old-fashioned.5 In his later study of religious types, Revelation and Religion, he defines 'living, essential religion' in terms of a reciprocal personal relationship between man and God.6 Finally, for this collection of authorities by which I am attempting to support the claim that a personal ultimate is fundamental to religion, I remind you of Gollwitzer's assertion that the personal way of speaking is unsurpassable for Christian talk of God. It is not a first step that could be followed by a still more proper way of speaking which expresses a relationship no longer of a personal kind. Personal ways of speaking are so much the life-blood of Christian faith that in abandoning them it would abandon also itself.7 Reference to authorities, however, is a selective and tendentious business 1 C. C. J. Webb, Problems in the Relations of God and Man (London: Nisbet, I 9 I I), pp. 245 f.; cf. p. 27I. Later, in his Gifford Lectures, Webb, prefers to speak of 'a God with whom we can stand in personal relations' rather than of 'a personal God' because he does not 'think that Religion is concerned with the nature of the divine self consciousness, except so far as this may be involved in the reality of our personal relations with God' (C. C. J. Webb, God and Personality (London: Allen and Unwin, I919), p. I53; cf. pp. 73, I28 if.). 2 R. G. Collingwood, Religion and Philosophy (London: Macmillan, I9I6), p. I I5; cf. pp. I I5 f. 8 G.

But even if we agree that for some major religions at least the personal nature of God as the ontologically, valuatively and rationally ultimate is a fundamental characteristic, the crucial problem is how to justify talk about God as personal. How, that is, can we justify the claim that the word 'God' can refer to an actual personal agent and is not just a cipher for some abstract principles, valuative ideals, autonomous laws, impersonal structure of reality or the gracious 'Encompassing of all encompassing'? This question seems at first sight to be divisible into two questions: first, What meaning can we give to statements about God as personal? and, secondly, How can we verify such statements? These two questions, however, are not distinct. The answer to each affects and is affected by the answer to the other. Thus while in this paper I will be considering problems basically concerned with the meaning of talk about God as personal and not with considering problems about the verification of such talk, this is to be considered as a heuristic device to impose a certain apparent clarity on what is really a messy interaction of ideas and also to restrict the length of this paper. In order to consider problems arising from the attribution of personal being to God, we need first to apprehend what such a description attempts to express. In formal terms it roughly indicates that God is to be regarded as a being which can properly be described as having the following overlapping qualities: self-identity, intelligence, consciousness of self and of others, volition, freedom as the choice between genuinely open possibilities, apprecia tion and enjoyment of value, relationships with other personal beings, the ability to act and to react positively and effectively to situations, and responsi bility for its actions. When Bertocci puts it that 'a person is the kind of being who is a knowing-willing-caring unity in continuity' and H. Richard Niebuhr that God's revelation of himself as 'First Person' is of 'faithful, truthful being',' they express only part of what it means to speak of God - or anyone else - as personal. To be personal also involves activity. Not only the kind of personality that a person has but the very fact that he is a personal being at all is revealed by the manner in which he acts in ways that are not determined by natural laws. According to C. C. J. Webb the use of the word 'personal' to describe this aspect of the nature of God, but not the concept of God thereby expressed, is relatively modern.2 While this is true on the whole, it should not be for gotten that Aquinas, for example, states that 'this name person is fittingly applied to God... in a more excellent way' since God is 'the supreme self I Bertocci, op. cit. p. 20; H. Richard Niebuhr, Radical Monotheism and Western Culture (London: Faber and Faber, I96I), pp. 46 f. 2 Webb, God and Personality, pp. 6I ff.</page><page sequence="8">148 DAVID A. PAILIN subsisting being, and the most perfectly intelligent being'.' As he goes on to indicate, though, this use of the word 'person' in relation to God is uncommon in classical Christian theology because of the word's use for a different purpose in Trinitarian formulae.2 Internal relations within the Godhead, however, are not the problem for this paper and I gladly follow I. T. Ramsey's remark that to attempt to overcome difficulties about a personal God by reference to the doctrine of the Trinity is to fail to distinguish the frying-pan from the fire.3 Granted, then, the understanding of God as personal which I have outlined, what problems arise when we examine more closely its attribution to that which is ontologically, valuatively and rationally ultimate? Here, at last, we begin to see in practice some of the implications of the tension between the anthropologicality of theological understanding and the ultimacy of its object. The first - and obvious - problem is that of the legitimacy of applying the notion of personal being to God when our apprehension of this notion is derived from and totally dependent upon our understanding of our own human mode of being. Is not the attribution of 'personal' to God, the critic might ask, a crude anthropomorphism which reduces God to the status of a big man and cannot be warranted as a consequence of the inescapable anthropologicality of theology? A Barthian theologian might seek to answer this question by holding that we do not properly understand what it means to be 'personal' by examining our own natures. We understand the term, rather, by reference to God 'just because He and He alone is a true, realfand genuine person'. We must, therefore, 'not try to conceive God ... according to our conception of personality', for this would be to 'make an idol out of God', but reach our conception of God from God's own revelation of himself and, presumably, derive our notion of personal from 'His being the archetypal Person'. Barth himself indicates the difficulty of such a derivation when he admits that God is ' personal in an incomprehensible way, in so far as the conception of His personality surpasses all our views of personality'.4 This difficulty need not make it impossible, though, since what is incomprehensible may yet be partially apprehensible. Where this solution to our problem breaks down is in its failure to see that 1 Aquinas, Summa Theologica, I, 29, 3. Aquinas' ascription of 'personal' being to God here must be understood, however, in terms of what he elsewhere says about the nature of God. In view, for example, of what he says about God's perfection as totally impassible actus purus, it is questionable whether he can really be said to describe the living God of Christian faith - cf. on this point 'Process Theology - Why and What?' in Faith and Thought (I972-3), voL. I00. 2 Cf. Aquinas, op. cit. i, 29, 4 and I, 30, i ff. Aulen, op. cit. p. 256 reminds us that the Fathers would regard us as heretics if we understood our modern concept of personality in their trinitarian formulae. Cf. I. T. Ramsey, op. cit. p. 56. ' K. Barth, The Knowledge of God and 7he Service of God (London: Hodder and Stoughton, I938), pp. 31 ff.; cf. Church Dogmatics, x, i (Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1936), p. 157 and also the similar treatment that Barth gives to the notion of fatherhood: 'we do not call God Father because we know what that is; on the contrary, because we know God's Fatherhood we afterwards understand what human fatherhood truly is. The divine truth precedes and grounds the human truth' (K. Barth, The Faith of the Church (London: Collins, I960), p. 37; cf. also Barth's Dogmatics in Outline (London: SCM, 1949), p. 43).</page><page sequence="9">THE THEOLOGIAN AND THE NATURE OF GOD I49 the ordo essendi of 'person' is not the same as the ordo cognoscendi for us of God as a personal being. The Barthian stress on the primacy of revelation for true knowledge fails, that is, to see that the notion of God as personal, and so as able to encounter us and reveal himself, is the presupposition of our ability to accept anything as revelation from God. Since, therefore, our acceptance of God's revelation depends upon our view that God is the kind of being who is able to reveal himself, we must start with a notion of God as personal derived from our human experience and understanding of personal being. And while God's self-revelation may modify and develop our notion of personal being, it cannot cease to be parasitic upon it without making itself impossible. A different response to the problem of the legitimacy of applying the notion of personal to God is to claim that God is not personal but supra personal.' The problem with this solution is that our range of understanding is limited to the personal and the impersonal modes of being and, therefore, the only description we can apply to beings that are not personal is imper sonal.2 The description of supra-personal is not one to which we can give any content except so far as we regard it as a way of describing what is perfectly personal by contrast with the imperfections of our experiences of personal being.3 Thus we might say that whereas we as persons are able to respond only to a limited number of others in a given space of time, the supra-personal being is not so restricted. This, however, is to understand God, as supra-personal, as different from us not in respect of the personal quality but in respect of the finitude and imperfections of our being.4 In the end, as Rashdall puts it, the word 'person' is 'no doubt inadequate to the reality' of God 'but it is at least more adequate than the terms employed by those who scruple to speak of God as a Person. It is at least more adequate and more intelligent than to speak of him as a force, a substance,. . . a collec tion of things, or a vague substratum of things, or even a mere totality of minds like our own.5 In himself and from the standpoint of absolute 1 Cf. K. Jaspers, Philosophical Faith and Revelation, trans. by E. B. Ashton (London: Collins, I967), pp. 141 ff.: 'even as the best that man knows in the world, as personality, Transcendence is still debased, so to speak, into his own kind of being. What is more than a person .., and surely not less than a person, is pointed out to man by what he is as a person' (p. I4I). 2 Cf. Gollwitzer, op. cit. p. I89, referring to the significance of Buber's Iand Tlou; cf. also P. Tillich, Theology of Culture (Oxford, New York, I964), pp. I31 f. - note that when Tillich says that the personal is a symbol for God, he regards a symbol as participating in the reality of that which it symbolizes. 3 Cf. G. Galloway, The Philosophy of Religion (Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1914), p. 504: 'to say that God is supra-personal' is to say that 'God is personal in a deeper, richer, and more perfect way than man is'. 4 Cf.J. R. Illingworth, Personality Human and Divine (London: Macmillan, I894), p. 2 I6 (and p. 53 quoting Lotze) who sees our finitude as limiting our development as persons. Our finitude certainly limits us but the limit is on the range of our personal being rather than on its quality as personal being. 5 Hastings Rashdall, Philosophy and Religion (London: Duckworth, I909), p. 56; cf. alsoJ. B. Cobb, A Christian NKatural Theology (Philadelphia: Westminster, I965), pp. I8892 for a convincing argu ment that the Whiteheadian notion of God, contrary to Whitehead's own indications, makes more sense in terms of 'an account of a living person than of an actual entity'.</page><page sequence="10">I50 DAVID A. PAILIN knowledge, God may be neitherimpersonal nor personal. From our inescapable situation, though, we have no way in which to know or to conceive him as such.' To deny that he is personal as we understand the notion in terms of our experience of personal being is to conceive him as less, not more, than our selves and therefore to conceive him as less than God, not more than our inadequate grasp of him as personal. Here, then, the anthropological structure of our understanding more than the ultimacy of God determines what we can meaningfully say about him. The necessity of basing our understanding of God as person upon our own experience of personal being raises fundamental problems for understanding what it is for God to be personal. One of these concerns the relation of the freedom intrinsic to a personal being to the perfection that is necessarily attributed to God as the object of worship and as the valuatively ultimate. On reflection there seems to be at least a tension between the freedom and the perfection of God's personal being for the necessity that God always be perfect seems to take away from him any real freedom of choice. Buri, for example, suggests that we discover our own personal being in our awareness of guilt and dissatisfaction that accompanies our sense of responsibility for our actions.2 But while this may be true of us, it does not seem possible to apply it to God. Since he is perfect, it does not seem possible to attribute to him any awareness of guilt or dissatisfaction so far as such an awareness reflects his own judgements on his own intended actions. Further more, can God even feel responsibility for his actions? Although this seems to be the fundamental condition of actions being personal actions, it is not easy to see what it can mean in God's case. I am not impressed with the argument that God cannot be said to be responsible for his actions since, as the ontologically, valuatively and rationally ultimate, there is no-one to whom he is 'responsible'. I suspect this argument of playing with words. What does impress me is the argument that a person is only responsible for his actions when he is free to choose for or against them. If, then, God must, qua perfect, choose always the best, in what sense is he free? He seems no more free, and so responsible, than an automatic heating system which is set to heat or cool a room so that the air is constantly at a given temp erature. The mechanism is not free and responsible for what it does: its actions produce the 'best' temperature on a purely mechanical (that is, impersonal) basis. Is not God similarly 'programmed' always to act in the 'best' way possible? - for if he could cease so to act, he would not be necessarily perfect and so would fail to fulfil one of the conditions of 1 Cf. M. Buber, Eclipse of God (New York: Harper, 1952), pp. 6o, 96 for the suggestion that God becomes a personal being in order to allow man to have a personal relationship with him. Such a suggestion, though, is highly problematic because we cannot conceive of a being choosing so to transform himself except in personal terms. 2 Buri, op. cit. pp. 20 f.: 'awareness of responsibility and realization of personhood are always bound up with the experience of dissatisfaction and with the knowledge of it'.</page><page sequence="11">THE THEOLOGIAN AND THE NATURE OF GOD I5I being 'God'. How, then, can we attribute the freedom of personal being to him? Another way of posing the basic question here is to point to the tension between the constancy, reliability and trustworthiness of God's character with the freedom of a person to act in new and even unpredictable ways. We all take a risk when we write or act upon a reference to someone's character because, since that person is a free person, he is not compelled to act always in the same way and for the same ends. One of the joys and excitements of personal relationships is that the unexpected may always happen and sometimes does. When it does in certain cases we excuse it by saying 'Well, we're only human' or praise it by talking of 'creativity'. But can we envisage any being, human or divine, that could never do the un expected and yet could be called a person?' I think not. Being a person means having the freedom to change, to develop, and even to make oneself. But if existence must precede essence to a significant extent even for God if he is to be a personal being, how can it be reconciled with his unchanging perfection? An unsatisfactory solution to this question is to preserve God's personal being at the cost of holding that he is perfect. It may be that the specification of God as inter alia a being that is valuatively ultimate in principle is not satisfied by any actual being. If this is so, it does mean, I think, not that our concept of God is wrong but that there is no God. Just as unsatisfactory in the end is the attempt to preserve God's personal being at the cost of denying that he is necessarily perfect. It may be argued that God is perfect because he contingently chooses to be perfect, not because he is coerced by his own structure of being. But to say that God is actually, by his own choice, perfect though he need not necessarily be so is to make 'God' the proper object for admiration, praise and emulation but not, I suspect, the proper object of unreserved adoration and worship. The latter characteristics, though, are essential to the concept of God both as the object of religious faith and as the valuatively ultimate. 'That than which a greater cannot be conceived' cannot, that is, be consistently thought of as having the possibility to be other than perfect, even if the possibility were never to be actualised, for if it had that possibility it would always have to be checked against some standard to see that it still were the greatest conceivable in value. In that case it would be the standard that was valuatively ultimate and the object of adoration. A more promising line of investigation is to reconsider the notion of perfection. In his important studies on this question, Hartshorne has shown the importance of using the appropriate model of perfection when we talk of God as perfect.2 God's perfection, at least so far as he is a personal being, is 1 On the unpredictability of personal being, cf. Webb, God and Personality, pp. I IO ff., 124 if. and especially pp. 266 ff. where he uses the analogy of artistic activity. 2 Cf. C. Hartshorne, Man's Vision of God, The Logic of Perfection and Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method for various discussions of the notion of God's perfection.</page><page sequence="12">I52 DAVID A. PAILIN not to be modelled on the unchanging perfection of a correct multiplication table or the abstract perfection of a regulative idea or the unrealized perfection of a goal or the mechanical perfection of a heating regulator. All these kinds of model are inappropriate to the perfection of a being that is personal - and so free. But is there a model for a situation in which a person can make a free choice and yet be perfect whatever he chooses? I think that there might be! I have two passions in food: thick, juicy, tender T-bone steak from a young, Texan, hand-fed, black Angus bull and vast portions of fresh, rich Scots salmon. I also cannot manage both at one meal and am completely satisfied if I have either. I do not in any way regret that I have not had the other. Now, take the ideal state that I am presented with a menu on which there are both items and someone else is paying for the meal. I may choose either: there is no reason why I should choose the one rather than the other. I will have no regrets afterwards that I made the wrong choice by choosing the one rather than the other. In such a situation I think we can see that I have a free choice and yet the resultant state, at least for me, will be perfect which ever is chosen. This is a facetious example of what I consider may be a way out of the problem of reconciling God's freedom as a person with his perfection. We can reconcile the two if we can consider that God's choices are always between equally valuable but noncompossible values. Since not all values are com possible,' it seems that this situation is possible. Whichever value God chooses, then, will correspond to a perfect will in God but lead to a state different from that which would have followed from a different choice. All I want to maintain now is that there is no necessary incompatibility between holding that God as a personal being has freedom to choose in a non-trivial way and that God as the valuatively ultimate is perfect.2 The coherent conceivability of freedom and perfection in God as a personal being may, however, be challenged on the grounds that such personal free dom is incompatible with the eternity of God. Notions as such as those of willing and creating imply temporal activity whereas God, as eternal, is outside any temporal order. C. A. Campbell, for instance, holds that to assert that God exists 'even everlastingly, in time, is incompatible with the conception of Him as a being that is self-complete' and makes him 'con ditioned in existence by something beyond Himself'. He therefore suggests that God's mode of existence is 'time-transcending'. But, in an attempt to have his cake and eat it, Campbell goes on to hold that this time-transcending 1 When, therefore, Campbell, op. cit. p. 264, states that 'to lack any kind of power or excellence is to be to that extent imperfect', he makes the notion of perfection an intrinsically inconsistent one. The notion that to be absolutely perfect means to have all possible values is one of the persistent errors in thought about God. 2 We can probably maintain the constancy and non-randomness of God's activity by under standing his choices in terms of the unending quest for increase in value.</page><page sequence="13">THE THEOLOGIAN AND THE NATURE OF GOD I53 state is not a timelessness that excludes time but 'somehow includes Time'., Here again, though, further reflection on the notion of perfection appropriate to God suggests that we do not need to try to make sense of such tortuous combinations of time-transcendence with the inclusion of time or, even less satisfactory, of the timeless total simultaneity of more traditional views of God's eternity. The eternity of God as God is an attribute that is required by God's religious role as the object of faith (for a God who could cease to be could not be an ultimate object of trust) and by his intellectual role as the ground of being, value and rationality. These roles are adequately fulfilled by the notion of God as the unique temporal being for whom there never was a time when he was not nor will be a time when he will not be since he is the ground of all possible reality. Time is thus no threat to him nor a struc ture that inappropriately conditions his activity as God. The consequence of attempts to go beyond this to assert some time-transcending or timeless character to God is either to offer strictly meaningless metaphysical compli ments to him or to deny the reality of this temporal world as the object of God's concern and action or to make God the cipher for some abstract principle or value. Since these consequences are not acceptable in a theistic understanding, and since nothing is lost by attributing to God 'eminent temporality' (except the inability to will, create, know temporally successive events as such and have reciprocal relations with temporally ordered beings like ourselves),2 I do not consider that there is any overwhelming religious or metaphysical reason for holding that God's eternity denies him the temporality implicit in personal being. Another objection to the ascription of personal being to God asserts the incompatibility of personal being with the infinity that is held to be a neces sary characteristic of God. Fichte, for instance, suggests that the self-identity or self-consciousness essential to personal being is inconceivable in the case of God because since in God as reflected upon, everything would be in one and one in everything, and would similarly be so for God as reflecting, there would be no distinguishing, in and through God, between the reflecting and the reflected, between conscious ness itself and the object thereof.3 Similarly Bradley, as one basis for his argument for the 'super-personal' nature of the Absolute, asserts that 'a person is finite or is meaningless'.4 The 1 Campbell, op. cit. p. 265. 2 Cf. the similar argument of H. R. Mackintosh, The Christian Apprehension of God (London: SCM, 2934), p. I46: 'Which limits God more - to say that He does have the capacity for fellowship .., or to say that He does not have it?' Traditional theology contains many claims about what are held to be intuitively obvious divine attributes. On reflection, however, some of them turn out not only to be not obvious but also intrinsically improbable. 3 Fichte, Science of Knowledge, translated by P. Heath andJ. Lachs (New York: Appleton-Century Crofts, 1970), p. 242. 4 F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality (Oxford, I969), p. 471; D. F. Strauss held a similar view - cf. H. R. Mackintosh, op. cit. pp. 142 ff.</page><page sequence="14">I54 DAVID A. PAILIN argument, however, is not all one way. Lotze, in contrast, argues that 'Perfect personality is reconcilable only with the conception of an Infinite Being; for finite beings only an approximation to this is attainable." The solution to this problem of the compatibility of the infinity and the personal being of God is to be found through a reconsideration of the notion of infinity that is required by and appropriate to God. Since one requirement of personal being is self-identity and since identity requires some form of determinateness, it does not seem possible to conceive of God as a personal being without any bounds and so without any determinateness whatsoever. But is boundlessness in all respects entailed by the ultimate status of God? If it is, then Spinoza would be correct in affirming that there is no reality that is not God. This unbounded and unboundable notion of infinity is not, however, what is required by a religiously and metaphysically adequate notion of God. What is required is, first, that there be nothing which is beyond God, no event or reality in time or space which is not immediately present to him and he to it, and, secondly, that there be no bounds to and no reality other than God's being and activity except those which he has willed directly or indirectly. The infinity of God, that is, is not absolute limitlessness but the state of being limited only by his own decisions. If these conditions are satisfied, then the concept of infinity appropriate to God is satisfied. But the satisfaction of these conditions is fully compatible with the limitation, boundedness and consequent distinguishability from others that is required for self-conscious self-identity. The Fichtean objection to the notion of God as personal may thus be held to be based upon a misunderstanding of what is meant by the proper attribution of infinity to God. The infinity of God's personal being is to be understood in two ways. First, God's consciousness is all-embracing. Unlike us with our restricted percep tions he is the individual who is aware of and responds to every other indi vidual, incorporating all their experiences within his own without loss or confusion. Nevertheless God is not to be identified without remainder with the world for he is the subject who both has all those experiences and also has his own purposes for the world and acts upon it in accordance with them. This characteristic of God's nature is well-expressed by Hartshorne. In his exposition of the panentheist position he 'distinguishes God from the " all " and yet makes him include all' and goes on to argue that this ' apparent paradox dissolves when we see that the "all" which is in God, yet not all of God, is the ordinary totality of actual, contingent existence, while the all which is God is that totality (stretching through infinite past time, and nearly all unknown to us) as involving, besides ordinary causes, the whole as an 1 H.

As the onto logically, valuatively and rationally ultimate, he creates and is not simply identical with the creatures that he creates,2 even though in his creative activity he also partially determines his own being by choosing which of non-compossible possibilities he will actualize and which will then forever be actualised objects in his experience. The second characteristic of the infinity of God's personal being is his limitless potentiality for creativity. At first sight Pannenberg might seem to be laying down impossible conditions when he holds that we can know God's reality and nature by revelation3 in view of the fact that a few pages later he suggests that the only acceptable revelation of God is of his infinity.4 How, we might ask, can we know the nature of God by revelation if such revelation can only declare his infinity? The answer lies, I think, in the revelation of God as the infinitely creative. Pannenberg himself speaks of the 'inexhaustibility' of God whose infinity is seen 'in the changes of history through the repeated break-up of existing religious forms of life and their displacement by new ones'5 while Hartshorne speaks of God as the 'neces sarily all-inclusive... whose potentiality for change is coextensive with the logically possible'.ff The attribution of unending creativity to God, though, does not reflect a vacillating pursuit of contradictory ends. Its unending variety can be understood as the expression of a constant intention for the actualization of value. Having tried to meet certain major objections to the possible meaningful ness of talk about God as personal, I now want briefly to indicate certain characteristics of God's personal being which I have not yet mentioned. These characteristics follow from the nature of God either as ultimate or as the proper object of religious faith. They do not show that it is improper to speak of God as personal but the peculiarity of his personal being. As the ultimate ground of reality, some at least of God's personal actions will have the odd quality of being contingent for him while their effects appear as necessary to us since they establish what are for us universal facts about reality. Hartshorne puts it that God is 'individual, but the individual with strictly universal functions, the all-encompassing and yet not merely universal principle of existence '.7 Let me try to illustrate the point I want to I C. Hartshorne, Man's Vision of God (Connecticut: Archon, I964), p. 348; cf. pp. 251 ff. where he considers God as 'the subject of all change'; cf. also 0. Pfleiderer, The Philosophy of Religion (London: Williams and Norgate, i888), III, 278 ff. It is this concept of God which meets H. W. Richardson's demand for a 'God of a sociotechnic intellectus' (Theology for a New World (London: SCM, I968), p. 23) and which at the same time meets the needs of 'the modern intellectus' in terms of a personal God (cf. pp. 9-I9). 2 Cf. Bertocci, op. cit. pp. 32-4 on the significance of the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo in this respect, and W. R.

God's primal creative activity, which establishes the fundamental structure of reality, is probably to be thought of as personal activity. This seems to be part of what the notion of God as creator means: to deny it would be to imply that the structure of reality in which we find ourselves is either absolutely necessary so that no other structure is really conceivable and the ontologically ultimate has no choice but to produce it or absolutely absurd. But if God's primal creative activity is personal, we must presumably think of it as a personal activity in which he actualizes one particular series of compossibilities out of an un known number of other possible series of compossibilities. Yet while we can inadequately envisage the kind of situation facing God by considering, for instance, an architect's choice between various alternative and equally attractive ways of fulfilling a commission, we cannot, I think, envisage the possibilities which God rejects. This is because our understanding of reality - probably even what seems to us to be a priori thought about truth and reality - is a product of and governed by the nature of the actual reality in which we find ourselves. By imaginative projections we may envisage possible worlds different from our own but it seems on examination that even the most inventive writer of science fiction or theoretical mathematician cannot do much more than tinker with the basic structure of being without his material ceasing to be intelligible to us. God, however, as the limitless ground of possibility, presumably can envisage universes with fundamentally different structures of reality and, consequently, with the actualizability of different compossibilities of value even though we cannot even imagine what he can thus envisage. This view of the personal activity of God has certain corollaries. First, as we have already indicated, what are brute and unalterable, even necessary, facts for us are the product of contingent choices for God. We cannot, how ever, know that they are the product of contingent choices by God through examining them but only through drawing inferences from our view that they were actualized by the personal activity of God. Thus we cannot argue from the contingencyofthe world to the personal activity and so to the personal nature of God. The only valid argument in fact is probably in the reverse direction. We can only know the contingency of the world if we know that God is personal and that the world was created by his personal act. A second corollary, which follows on from the first, is that, contrary to some criticisms, there is an important distinction in the kind of reasoning found in the cosmo logical argument for the existence of God between holding that the world is its own first cause and holding that God is this first cause. To hold that God is its first cause is to hold that its structure is finally dependent on a deliberate personal choice - and so can be approached as possibly rationally intelligible. Though the structure of reality may present itself as necessary, brute fact to us, ultimately it is as it is because of personal decisions by God. The problem,</page><page sequence="17">THE THEOLOGIAN AND THE NATURE OF GOD I57 as we have already indicated, is that we cannot use this understanding in arguments advanced to justify belief that there is a personal God because such understanding is a product of such belief. The third corollary, then, is that we cannot expect to see God's personal nature evidenced by contrast with the structure of reality. Whereas we perceive another human being's personal nature by considering where his actions are in contrast with the natural order of reality, in the case of God there is no structure against which we can similarly contrast his actions and so discern the fact and nature of his personal being. Even less can we hope to perceive God's personal nature by contrasting the decisions which he makes with those which he might have made since we cannot envisage in any significant way the alternatives rejected by God. I can reasonably use John's decision to follow this course of action to determine something about his personal nature because my knowledge of the possibilities open to people in his situation allows me fairly safely to compare the course chosen with those that were eschewed. With God the theologian has no such comparable situation. At this point a critic may well be thinking that I have quite illicitly moved from holding that some at least of God's personal actions have effects with the quality of universality and necessity for us to holding that all of his actions are so characterized. Let me disabuse him. I do not see that the ontologically ultimate status of God implies that all his actions must have for us the status of universal laws of nature. To hold this, furthermore, would be to deny that God can have the individual-person-to-individual-person reciprocal relationships that are essential if his personal being is to be personal for us. At the same time we must not forget that God is the valuatively ultimate. Consequently his actions must never be less than perfect - which would be the case if his non-universal actions involved partiality in the sense of favouritism. It is on this theological and moral ground that the claim that God effects particular miracles seems to me to be highly suspect in view of the apparent absence of comparable activity in other cases. The particular activity of God must be understood, rather, as the activity that at any and every point seeks the greatest value through bringing each individual to the maximum satisfaction that is compatible with the highest satisfaction of all other actual and possible individuals.' Here again, though, our limited and regrettably self-interested perspective is not likely to provide us with a very revealing standpoint for perceiving the activity of God. Furthermore, it is at least cogent to consider that if God intends us to develop as personal beings, he will largely act incognito. This view may be a theological excuse for the theologian's failure to specify any actions as clear manifestations of God's personal purposes but I think that it can be defended on the grounds that if God's involvement were not so obscure, there would be serious practical Cf. Hartshorne, Logic of Perfection, p. 142.</page><page sequence="18">158 DAVID A. PAILIN restrictions on man's ability to respond freely and personally to God's purposes. It may be possible to speculate, that is, that a less obscure mani festation of God as personal would inhibit, if not prohibit, our development as persons and so the possibility of our coming to have personal (rather than slavish) relationships to God. Such a situation, however, increases the difficulty of verifying claims about God's personal nature because it seems to follow that the kind of evidence that would show God to be personal is ruled out in principle by God's personal purpose that the creation should contain persons besides himself.' The question now arises whether there is any conceivable evidence that may be offered significantly to verify the claim implicit in the third funda mental characteristic of an adequate theistic theology, namely, that God, the ontologically, valuatively and rationally ultimate, is an actual personal being. This question, however, must be left for another occasion even though its investigation will probably reciprocally interact with our pre-under standing of God's personal nature. This is because, as I have already suggested, personal being includes freedom to change. Consequently any determination of the nature of God's personal being in the light of past actions must not be allowed to preclude the possibility of change in any way that is appropriate to his ultimate nature. Barth rendered theologians an important service when he reminded them that God, the transcendentally other, was not confined to the structures of any previously valid apprehension of him. If God is personal, he is neither dead not abstract - and so he is not unchange able nor unchanging. The theologian, happily then, can never be out of a job for he must constantly check that his understanding of God still holds good! In a processive reality he must expect not eternally valid but continually changing insights. A theology which is not open to change, even radical change, may be presumed to have lost contact with the living God.2 1 Cf. C.
