<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAN'S STUDY OF LIGHTNING By F. HEPBURN, M.A., M.Sc. Lecturer in Physics , Nottingham, University The story of man's investigation of lightning phenomena begins in pre-history and yet, as so often with those occurrences which have existed from the dawn of time, it proved an intractable problem from the viewpoint of the natural philosopher until he performed some meagre experiment in his laboratory and discovered the clue to the more majestic manifestation. It tells of his ceaseless quest for " understanding " with its perennial round of observation, analogy, experiment and explanation, which was almost completely baulked until the availability of new techniques in the last half- century enabled the subject to be probed with renewed enthusiasm. We may be tempted to regard the ancients as naïve, but they had discovered just what lightning was. A blinding light, only to be compared with the sun in its brilliance, associated with noises most terrible in their grandeur - what human agency could be their cause ? - it must be a manifestation of the Gods. The fury of the elements and their highly respected destructive power were obviously an indication of the concern and displeasure of these anthropomorphic beings - and that was putting it mildly ! They more resembled insane or drunken rage - but these Gods were rather fickle and highly strung creatures, and could be expected to be overdemon- strative at times. However, such being its nature, lightning had indubitable applications, if it were granted that Jove used his thunderbolts not only as punishments but also as warnings. Thus lightning divination became part of Roman statecraft for many centuries. As early as 300 b.c. the College of Augurs was entrusted absolutely with the observation and divination of lightning, upon whose reports the Magistrates were legally bound to cancel all public assemblies for the day. Just as with atomic energy in this present age, it seems to have taken little time for the new skill to be pros- tituted in the cause of expediency - that name given to the short- cut method whereby the end justifies the means and is made respect- able to the squeamish - so, in those times, the words " I will watch 635</page><page sequence="2">636 SCIENCE PROGRESS the sky " became the accepted formula for announcing opposition and applying the veto. At the time Caesar was exploring this countryside, some rather satirical things were being said about these abuses in Rome, but more surprising still is Lucretius' funda- mental enquiry, based on closer observation. He wanted to know why if Jupiter sent the lightning he should scatter his bolts so wastefully and unreasonably on the sea and even on his own temples, why he showed preference for high mountains and trees and why he waited for thick clouds before manifesting his opinions. Despite this leadership given to enquiring minds, the climate of opinion changed imperceptibly and lightning was an object of superstition in Europe into the eighteenth century. It was custom- ary to supplement prayer with the violent ringing of church bells, the poor believing this pious exercise dispersed the evil spirits, whilst the better informed said the undulations it produced broke the continuity of the lightning path. Mediaeval bells are frequently inscribed " Fulgura frango " - I break the lightning. Such calling of the bell-ringers to the ropes when thunderstorms were approach- ing proved highly dangerous in view of the frequency with which church steeples were struck and damaged by lightning. A publica- tion by Fisher in Munich in 1784, states that, in 33 years, 386 church towers were struck and 103 bell-ringers killed at the ropes. Several edicts were issued in France making the custom illegal, in an attempt to reduce the mortality rate due to lightning. In Schleswig-Holstein, over a 10-year period from 1874, churches came a close second to windmills and together constituted 95 per cent, of the 405 buildings struck. Several well-known churches have had interesting case histories. In a region where thunderstorms are more frequent than anywhere else in Europe, the bell-tower of St. Mark's in Venice was nine times severely damaged in less than 400 years, three times being completely destroyed. Since a Franklin lightning rod was installed in 1766 no further trouble has been experienced. One April evening in 1718 no less than two dozen church towers on the Brittany coast were damaged and 52 years later a French abbey was struck three times in 20 minutes and burnt to the ground. With the advent of artillery in the eighteenth century it was natural to use vaults and crypts as powder magazines, since churches had long been used to store weapons and food in wartime. Tall steeples and explosive contents made churches highly undesirable residences during thunderstorms. One disaster at Brescia in N. Italy destroyed one-sixth of the city and caused the death of 3000 persons. Amongst the most pathetic occurrences is the destruction</page><page sequence="3">man's study of lightning 637 of Fort Malaga in Sumatra in 1782, when lightning set off 400 barrels of powder, the lightning conductors having been removed by the East India Co., who had been advised that they were more of a danger than a protection. The lightning conductor is the monumental practical outcome of the diligence and insight of Benjamin Franklin, who stands as the lone fore-runner in the modern scientific investigation of the phenomenon ; so outstanding that some of his conclusions stood for 170 years as the only direct and reliable evidence about the electrification of thunderclouds. The mid-1700's were years in which electrical machines were drawing-room novelties, but Franklin put his experimentation to good account. Many had commented upon the similarity between the short electric sparks such machines could give and lightning discharges. Franklin observed closely and listed a dozen points of similarity, including that of " destroying animals." On one occasion he went beyond the ceremonious killing of a turkey at a picnic outing and almost despatched himself, so the investigation was not without its hazards. He had also investigated the peculiar ability of pointed conductors to discharge electrified objects without the accompaniment of a spark. As he expressed it : " The electric fluid is attracted by points. We do not know whether this property is in lightning, but, since they agree in all particulars wherein we can already compare them, is it not probable that they agree likewise in this ? Let the experiment be made." In this way he attempted to test directly whether " clouds that contain lightning are electrified or not." What Franklin intended may be expressed thus : When an isolated rod of metal is near an electrified object, such as a thunder- cloud, the electrification draws charge of opposite sign to the near end of the metal and repels charge of the same sign to the far end of the conductor. This is known as " electric induction." If in addition, the electrification is great enough, charge will stream off the near end of the rod as a glow discharge and be carried by air molecules to the object to neutralise its charge. In small-scale experiments the glow discharge is enhanced if the rod has a sharp point. The process continues until the rod has a measurable excess charge of the same sign as that on the original object. If the rod is connected to the earth it will continue to discharge the object as long as it is near enough. Franklin suggested the erection of a long insulated pointed iron rod at the top of some high tower or steeple, but delayed the experiment for want of an appropriate building. However, the experiment was performed at ground level by d'Alibard, a French physicist, near Paris, and on May 10, 1752,</page><page sequence="4">638 SCIENCE PROGRESS a stream of sparks was obtained between the iron rod and an earthed piece of wire, showing that the iron rod had become electrified from a thundercloud overhead. Doubting the significance of this result in Europe, Franklin decided to experiment with a kite in the absence of a suitable tower and obtained a gratifying result. The unexpected success of a comparatively low rod simplified his experi- ments and only a few months later he was able to conclude that " the clouds of a thundergust are most commonly in a negative state of electricity, but sometimes in a positive state - the latter, I believe, is rare." The only improvement we can now make is to replace " clouds " by the words " the bottom of clouds." Franklin was unable to explain the occurrences adequately, and it was perhaps largely because of this that the utilisation of the knowledge had such an unsettled history. He was quick to suggest that by connecting the rod to the earth it might be possible - to quote Franklin's own words - " to draw the electric fire silently out of a cloud before it strike and thereby secure us from that sudden and terrible mischief," but it seemed very unlikely that a pointed rod 30-40 feet high would be able to discharge an immense thunder- cloud a mile above it. Moreover, he himself could not decide whether a lightning rod would neutralise the cloud charge or attract it and conduct it safely to earth, but he had the courage to try the experiment and persuade others to do the same. The dilemma was not without some relevance, since any encour- agement of a discharge might do more harm than good, and great controversy raged amongst the experts about the desirability of pointed conductors. Would knobs not do just as well to conduct the discharge if it did strike, without involving the attractive properties of points ? This view was considerably supported by the observation that lightning discharges occasionally did strike these pointed conductors, rather than being dispersed by them ; so that which encouraged the silent glow discharge appeared to have the same effect upon the more violent lightning, although frequently in these cases the discharge was safely conducted to earth. Dis- astrous consequences have always been traced to faulty or ill- advised installations, in which a low resistance path to earth was not maintained. Much heat and emotion went into the weighty discussions of " Knobs versus Points " and even the use of either. Personal affront at the overthrow of cherished ideas on the part of scientists and opportunism on the part of the politically, financially and economically minded - both served more than sincere concern for truth, to stem the growing tide of evidence and bring the subject</page><page sequence="5">man's study of lightning 639 into such disfavour. After Franklin assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence of the American colonies in 1776, the subject became so confused with politics that even George III entreated the President of the Royal Society to use his influence in rescinding resolutions in favour of pointed conductors ; however, he had to content himself with the removal of the points on the Palace of St. James and Sir John Pringle 's integrity remained unblemished. The scientific difficulties of the controversy were immense enough without the introduction of personal and political issues and, as so often happens in such circumstances, each of the protagonists had part of the truth, but was unable or unwilling to admit it in his antagonists. The Abbé Noliet in France was right in maintaining that these paltry rods had no appreciable effect on the electrification of the cloud and Wilson, here, was correct in saying blunt conductors were as good as pointed ones, but both were wrong in fearing the attractive influence of the rod, for it is this virtue which bestows upon the conductor its protective property over neighbouring buildings. Though Franklin might be said to have had his eyes on the clouds, his feet were firmly set on the solid ground of experi- ment and experience and probably it was because he was able to keep them there that his work was so fruitful. With the passage of time the suspicion and superstition of the general populace was gradually broken by the ever-increasing list of successes, and Franklin's " heretic rods " became the normal protection for high or isolated buildings. During the subsequent century experiments continued, with few outstanding discoveries. Bigger and better kites were flown, carry- ing " knobbed and pointed " conductors, in an attempt to discover their relative merits. Since sparks up to 10 feet long were obtained, it is remarkable there are no more recorded fatalities. Probably the death of Prof. Richmann in St. Petersburg in the earliest days of the work was a timely warning to others. One sideline led to an interesting and important discovery. Galvani used the classical frog's leg as a sensitive detector while investigating the disappearance of the induced charge on the end of an earthed Franklin rod when the cloud is suddenly discharged by a neighbouring lightning flash. He stumbled upon the principle of the electric battery when he found he could make the leg twitch without thunderstorms being present if some of the connecting wires of dissimilar metals accident- ally touched together. Any released charge upon an exposed earthed rod must flow back into the earth through the rod when the cloud charge inducing it is neutralised. A person standing</page><page sequence="6">640 SCIENCE PROGRESS beneath a thundercloud behaves in the same manner, and the sudden flow of charge through the body from the head to ground can give a " return shock " quite capable of causing death without any direct connection with the lightning flash. Investigation of sudden changes in the amount of induced charge on exposed conductors at various distances from a thundercloud led to the conclusion that a thundercloud was not simply an object charged up with electricity of one sign. By 1926 it had been decided that such clouds had a large positive charge situated a mile or two above the negatively charged base of the cloud, and that lightning flashes could take place entirely within the cloud between these two centres of charge. This conclusion became necessary because only so was it possible to explain how a single flash could release charge of one sign from a nearby conductor and the opposite sign from a more distant one. Close to the cloud the lower charge is more able to induce charges, but at greater distances the upper charge has greater effect and induces charge of the opposite sign, since the effectiveness for inducing charge is a function of both distance and height above ground of the cloud charges. So that upon neutralisation of these cloud charges opposite signs of induced charge are released. This interpretation agreed well with the visual observation of two types of lightning : Cloud flashes when the actual discharge path is masked by cloud particles and diffuse illumination of the sheet of cloud results, and flashes to earth in which the actual path is visible and sometimes appears to fork near the ground. Another conspicuous feature of the flash to ground is the flicker- ing light emitted and the reason for this was shown when photo- graphy was used to supplement visual observation. One of the earliest lightning photographs taken, in 1884, showed that several discrete discharges, or strokes, occurred at short intervals of time in the same track, which was moving sideways due to a strong wind. Such wind displacements of the track resolve the flash into its individual discharges. The effect can be made more obvious by moving the camera during the exposure, giving greater separation of the component strokes. It is frequently found that the lower part of a subsequent stroke takes an alternative path, producing forked appearance of the flash. Photography also showed that the track was generally much more branched than judged visually ; and that this prolific branching - very like the roots of a tree - was restricted to the first stroke in the flash. As well as showing that a lightning flash was frequently composed of a number of separate strokes, as many as 30 or 40 in rare instances, occurring at intervals</page><page sequence="7">man's study of lightning 641 from ^ to Ýo sec-&gt; an(l that any forked appearance of the flash was due to these separate strokes taking slightly different paths, such photographs provide the only direct evidence for the diameter of the actual lightning channel. It is a curious thing that man's knowledge of the behaviour of electricity and his applications of it should have advanced so rapidly, yet until 20 years ago his knowledge of one of its earliest manifesta- tions - the lightning spark - was negligible. Practically nothing was known of the mechanism whereby the normally insulating air could be converted, in a fraction of a second, into a six-inch white- hot conductor. From the circumstantial evidence of photographs showing tree- like branching of the initial stroke, always away from the cloud, it seemed certain that the initial disturbance travelled towards the ground, but it could not be decided that the subsequent discharges, along the same channel, travelled in the same direction ; and nothing was known about the rates at which they travelled, except that they were very great. When it is realised that the mile or so of air between cloud and ground is crossed by these discharges in times as short as a ten-thousandth of a second the ambiguity as to which way they went is understandable. In 1902 Sir Charles Boys designed a camera which was ultimately to solve the problem. If a discharge were to travel vertically and were photographed with an ordinary camera, the result would be a vertical line on the film ; but if, during the flash, the photographic material was pulled sideways the result would be a distorted photo- graph, a line sloping to the left or right, depending on which way the discharge travelled and which way the film was pulled, the amount of distortion measuring the time taken for the process. Since lightning flashes have twisting paths rather than vertical ones it is necessary to have a reference photograph from which to measure these distortions. For technical reasons, Boys obtained his two photographs from a pair of lenses, one at each end of a rod, which was rotated at high speed in front of the stationary photographic paper rather than keeping the lenses fixed and moving the paper. This simple form of the apparatus could only be used at night, away from bright lights, and for 30 years Boys tried unsuccessfully to obtain a satisfactory photograph. However, a team of workers under Schonland in S. Africa tackled the problem in a more favour- able area and have been very successful in working out a detailed timetable of the various stages in a discharge to ground. They discovered that the discharge process starts at the base of the cloud in the form of a faintly luminous streamer, which advances TT</page><page sequence="8">642 SCIENCE PROGRESS in a series of jumps, each about 50 yards long, taking about 2 mil- lionths of a second and repeated at intervals of 70 millionths of a second. Each advance into the air below is accompanied by the emission of light from the newly created portion of the streamer as the originally non-conducting air is split into electrified particles. This provides a highly conducting extension of the streamer channel which allows more negative charge in the cloud base to pass along it and produce further ionisation of the tip of the streamer. This leader streamer shows frequent twisting and branching, like the roots of a tree growing downwards to the earth at the rate of 500 miles/sec. As the negatively charged branches of the leader streamer get nearer the earth, the induced positive charges on any nearby projecting objects, such as trees, steeples or houses, become so great that the last few yards of the gap are bridged by streamers travelling upwards to meet the downcoming channel. A lightning conductor is able to initiate an upwards streamer earlier than other projecting objects in the vicinity because of its elevated position. The occurrence of an upward streamer decides the point at which the flash will reach earth ; hence a lightning conductor has a protective action over nearby objects. The enormous discharge currents are led safely to earth through a low resistance metallic path instead of causing large explosive heating and high voltages by flowing through timber or masonry, which offer very much greater resistance to the discharge. However, it is to be noted that this action only takes place when it is almost certain that something within the very restricted region below the advancing streamer is going to be struck. Immediately the connecting link is established, some of the enormous induced charge beneath the streamer rushes into the foot of the lightning channel and up it towards the cloud, and also out along branches of the leader streamer which did not reach the ground, neutralising the negative charge which had come from the cloud. This return streamer travels much faster than the leader, starting at roughly 20,000 miles /sec., and is responsible for the intense light of the lightning flash caused by the particles of air being bombarded by other fast moving electrified particles. The intense heating causes the air channel to become white hot (a temperature of 15,000° C. can be reached in a fifty-thousandth of a second) and the sudden expansion of the hot air gives the sharp crack to the thunder. In a matter of a few ten-thousandths of a second the sudden surge of current is over and the channel illumina- tion fades away. It frequently happens that the cloud base contains several charged cells, only one of which is discharged by the first</page><page sequence="9">man's study of lightning 643 stroke, and another leader streamer develops between the discharged cell and one of its neighbours. In this case a second streamer travels down the channel a few hundredths of a second after the return stroke has passed. This streamer travels about ten times as quickly as the original one, and does not hesitate or branch the way the first one did, but goes straight along the channel with a bright luminous tip. Once again when this streamer reaches the ground, having restored the channel to its highly conducting state, a second surge of current flows up the channel towards the cloud. As subsequent centres of charge are tapped each produces the dart leader and return stroke, giving the flash a typical flickering appearance. This sequence of events, with minor modifications, is applicable to discharges to ground generally. The magnitudes quoted are for those flashes which are easiest to photograph ; more typical flashes have leader processes which last much longer, even to as much as ' sec. But major differences are observed when lightning strikes very high buildings. The Empire State Building, in particular, projects half-way from the ground to the cloud base to a height of 1250 feet, and in three-quarters of the flashes the first leader streamer starts from the building rather than the cloud, but subsequent streamers travel downwards. Almost silent discharges from this building have been reported, thus justifying Franklin's early idea of " drawing the electric fire silently out of a cloud before it come nigh enough to strike," though in this case it is certain that the building encourages discharges which would not otherwise occur. These photographic studies have given considerable insight into the problem of the discharge, by providing a detailed timetable for the processes, but have had very little to tell us on two fundamental issues, namely the quantities of electric charge involved and their positions at various stages of the flash. This information has been provided by two distinct techniques. With the advent of electronics it became possible to observe just how the induced charge on an exposed conductor varied during the course of a flash, and to cor- relate the results with those obtained by direct photography. By these means, it became possible to estimate the amount of charge involved in the various stages. Perhaps the most outstanding results of such investigations was the discovery of the enormous amount of preparatory work which precedes a lightning flash, and the extent of the mopping-up operations associated with the few brief instants of splendour. It has been discovered that, for as long as ' sec. before a flash occurs, the ionised air produced by high speed electrons accelerated in the intense electric fields near the</page><page sequence="10">644 SCIENCE PROGRESS streamer is lowering very large static charges, of the order of 10 coulombs, into the air below the cloud, some remaining in the leader channel and some being sprayed into the surrounding air by means of corona discharge processes, causing a steady change in the induced charge. During this stage a current of the order of 100 amp. flows from the cloud down the leader streamer into the air. When the streamer reaches the ground the small amount of charge immediately available in the channel is neutralised by the rapid surge of current from the induced charge on the ground. This freely available charge remaining in the streamer channel may be less than one- tenth of the total charge lowered by the streamer, but is neutralised so rapidly that very large currents are involved, and the brilliant stage of the discharge is produced. The rest of the available charge in the cloud and the air surrounding the streamer channel is gradually removed by a continuing current persisting for sec. or longer. The estimation of the actual currents flowing at the foot of the lightning channel from induced charge measurements are inaccurate and ambiguous ; and for this reason such evidence has been obtained by the most direct and daring method - that of catching the light- ning and measuring it. The Empire State Building is so frequently struck - about two dozen times a year - that it has been worth installing elaborate measuring apparatus. Unfortunately, dis- charges to such very high structures are not typical, but the general results of the experiments there agree reasonably with those from other methods. In Russia, measurements of currents in balloon cables suffer from the same criticism. As the observing site becomes more typical, it becomes less worth while installing elaborate apparatus, as the number of flashes intercepted each year becomes negligible. Less questionable results are from measurements of current surges on electric power transmission lines or from rods of magnetic material placed at the feet of a great number of electric pylons. When one of these pylons receives a discharge, the material becomes magnetised proportionately to the maximum current flowing in the nearby girder and can be collected for laboratory measurement. A critical survey of all these results leads to the conclusion that the current in an average return stroke builds up to 30,000 amp. in about 6 millionths of a second, gradually falling to half this value in 25 millionths of a second, thereafter gradually falling to zero, though in certain cases currents of a few thousand amperes persist for a few thousandths of a second. The total charge transferred from cloud to ground in a flash averages 20-30 coulombs, and, since the difference in voltage is around 50 MV., the energy involved is</page><page sequence="11">man's study of lightning 645 something like 400 kWh. - enough to keep two or three hundred electric fires going for an hour. A really active thunderstorm can produce two to three flashes a minute for an hour, and the average dissipation of energy for this period is 50 MW. - equivalent to one of the generators commonly installed at power stations. Man's greatest satisfaction in discovery and understanding of the occurrences around him is generally to be found in his successful utilisation of the knowledge by applying it to relevant outstanding problems. Probably the greatest interest in the nature of lightning has been shown by those responsible for distributing electric power by overhead cables, for most breakdowns are due to this cause. The design of insulators and transformers to withstand the enormous voltage and current surges necessitates a detailed knowledge of what to expect when power lines are struck by lightning, to which they are particularly prone because of their elevated position and wide spread over open countryside. Apart from direct damage, due to strokes to earth, lightning can be a considerable disturbance in radio broadcasting, especially on the medium wave band, where it is the main unavoidable source of interference with good reception. A study of this nuisance led to one important use of lightning flashes - that of indicating the positions of thunderstorm areas, which is of importance to aviators and meteorologists. By means of radiolocation techniques it is now possible to have warning of thundery conditions thousands of miles out over the Atlantic or over sparsely inhabited areas, without the need for isolated observation posts. Thundery regions can be very dangerous to low-flying aircraft, because the extreme turbulence encountered there can strain the aeroplane structure to the breaking point. Persistent thunderstorms travelling across the Atlantic give the weather forecaster early warning of the occurrence and position of cold frontal storms, of use in forecasting not only the arrival of rainy conditions but the head-winds expected for aircraft flying to America. This latter information enables more accurate estimation of fuel requirements and pay-load capacity. In the more academic realm, the radio waves from lightning can be used to explore the underside of the ionosphere - the electrified layer 50-60 miles above the earth, which is responsible for the absorption of short wave radio transmissions. The higher regions of this layer can be explored with pulses from radio transmitters, but to obtain radio waves reflected back from the lowest regions would require enormous transmitters of impossible power. Light- ning flashes would be almost ideal transmitters, if only they would occur in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, they do</page><page sequence="12">646 SCIENCE PROGRESS not, so the best use has to be made of them, accepting their unco- operative nature as unavoidable. In conclusion, it is of interest to notice how the heretical ideas of one age become the antiquated curiosities of another as sluggish, ill-informed popular opinion has yielded to the encouraging, some- times despairing, beckoning of a thread of visionaries. We are all willing to throw ideas of Jove's thunderbolts, and drawing of fire from clouds with pin-points, into the land of limbo, but when it comes to such " real " things as atoms, electrons and electricity our minds balk at the effort. The lesson of the story is that we must be ever open and receptive to those facts which disagree with our hard-earned and cherished ideas of the world around us. Only by allowing these difficulties to stimulate our minds can we truly prepare the way for further progress. References Appleton, E. V., et al. (1926). Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 111, 615 and 654. Boys, C.
