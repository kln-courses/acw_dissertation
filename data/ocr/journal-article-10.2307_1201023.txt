<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Problem of God in Philosophy of Religion. By HENRY DUMERY. Translated by CHARLES COURTNEY. Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1964. 135 pages. Though Henry Dumery has been writing incisive studies in philosophy and in the phi- losophy of religion since 1942 and has now completed at least a dozen major works, this translation of his Le probleme de Dieu en philosophie de la religion (Paris, 1957) is the first appearance of his thought in the English language. Charles Courtney, the Drew Uni- versity theologian and philosopher of religion who has also studied with Dumery, has thus provided a timely and meticulous translation which serves several purposes. It offers to the English reader a kind of comprehensive sam- pling of the manifold interests and facets of the thought of this student of Maurice Blondel who is also one of the ablest representatives of the French tradition of "l'analyse rdflexive." Also, as included within the Northwestern Uni- versity series in phenomenology and existen- tial philosophy, Dumery's work must be re- garded as the first extensive critical effort to utilize Husserlian-oriented reductive techniques for purposes of clarifying the peculiarly reli- gious form of intentionality. There have been phenomenologists of religion before, to be sure, but none which drew such particular attention to the formal and categorical aspects of reflec- tion-concerning-faith in religious consciousness. Nor, does it seem, have many approached this</page><page sequence="2">308 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION methodological task with the critical sensitivity and analytical skill which Dumery's works manifest. The focal point of The Problem of God is twofold. On the one hand, Dumery seeks to clarify the relationship between religion and philosophy. And, on the other hand, this phi- losopher of religion attempts a kind of "mon- stration" concerning the presence of God which, while susceptible to none of the dom- inant criticisms raised against "anthropomor- phism" or "objectivism," nevertheless provides the opportunity for genuine divine-human dia- logue. The focal point is twofold, and not simply duo: the development of the argument for God depends upon carefully measured dis- tinctions between (1) the religious and (2) the philosophic ranges of concern. Dumery refers to the method by which this differentiation is secured as a "critical dissolution," the elabo- rate precedent for which is presented in the foundational work Critique et Religion: Pro- blames de mithode en philosophie de la religion (Paris, 1957). As one might expect, the "critical dissolution" has reference to distinct levels of consciousness and points ultimately to the dis- tinction between spontaneity and reflection. The formula is as follows: religion is related to philosophy as spontaneity is related to re- flection, or as intention is related to analysis, or as prospective action is related to retro- spection. Dumery belabors the point that "the affirmation of God is a work of free and spon- taneous consciousness. The work of philosophi- cal reflection is to state in what way this affir- mation is coherent and obligatory or on the contrary, vain and superfluous" (p. 8). Hence, in order to free an occasion for a "living spir- ituality," this reflexive analyst discloses the veritable fictitiousness of the "God of the phi- losophers" who is frequently nothing more than the determinative pole within a concep- tual series or the necessary implicate of sys- tematic reflection. Again, there is novelty in the way in which Dumery calls attention to that frequently made distinction, a novelty which is more fully elaborated in Critique et Religion, in which Dumery compares and contrasts his own in- terpretation of the relation between philosophy and religion with other dominant or classic ones. Though his fundamental interest is in securing the distinction between the two ranges of activity and in assessing their responsibili- ties toward each other, his thought must also be viewed as a reproach of all "dualisms." Hence, the ultimate goal of his "dissolution," or of his analytic, is the establishment of har- mony-indeed, unity--between religion and philosophy, and, in a certain sense, between the God of spontaneous faith and of retrospec- tive reflection. The rule by which distinctions of this sort can be maintained within a context whose final purpose is establishment of rapport is described in the following formula (which also refers Dumery's study to a not always congenial, classical, theological past): "non plus seulement intellectus quaerens fidem, ni fides quaerens intellectum, mais bien: intellec- tus, media fide, quaerens intellectum" (Cri- tique et Religion, p. 233). Understanding phi- losophy, then, to have the task of "criticizing the products of spontaneous consciousness" (p. 6), Dumery can apply this critical reflec- tion to living spirituality without vitiating the distinction between criticsm and spontaneity. "Philosophy simply procures for religion the means of a recovery of the latter's categories and schemes, the advantage of a reflection on itself, that the religious man does not attempt and is not able to attempt at his level of be- havior" (p. 31). At the same time, even though religion's categories and schemes (when faith formulates itself) are taken from the logico- rational context (p. 10), the source of religious affirmations is the life of interiority and not properly the context of conceptual formaliza- tion. Hence, the affirmations of faith can be transposed onto the retrospective-reflective plane, just as a primary intention is amenable to structural order. This procedure is a com- mon one and, in intent, entirely justifiable. Yet the transposition is, indeed, transposition: nei- ther faith or the affirmations of faith are pro- duced from the logico-rational order. On the contrary, it is spirituality which allows intelli- gible order which is transcended by the God who is transordinal. Spirituality thus estab- lished and confirms retrospective reflection and isolates a context wherein it is both appropri- ate and necessary. When intelligible order con- tains the categorization by which affirmations of faith are made to cohere, theology itself can be described as "the choosing of a philosophy in view of faith's reflection." Dumery's use of his carefully drawn distinc- tions is neither simply analytical nor method- ological. In addition, the book The Problem of</page><page sequence="3">CRITICAL REVIEWS 309 God is an exercise (or, more precisely, a part of a larger exercise) in theological construc- tion. The differentiation between reflective and spontaneous consciousness is referred to Hus- serlian-derived levels of intentionality, within which context Dumery argues for an additional reduction by which to secure a unity which transcends all determination. The stages of re- duction imply a kind of schema by which the ranges of prospective and retrospective activ- ity can be distinguished. Beyond that, the rec- ognition that the reductive process itself im- plies successive forms of determination which, in turn, depend upon a series of specifications of the one-many relationship can be utilized to support a theistic hypothesis The advance in this argument, as Dumery conceives it, is that theism is referred to certain requirements of the reductive technique and, hence, no longer needs to rest upon the "objectivity" implicit in the many attempts to "demonstrate the exist- ence of God." (In this regard, Courtney cites Jean Lacroix's comment: "Dumery's whole originality--more traditional than one would think-is to separate modern humanism from its atheist context.") But, while theism seems confirmed by a kind of reductionist entailment, that support is in keeping with the more par- ticularly religious aspiration for unity. God, therefore, is in series with no "order": meth- odologically, this means that God is the perfect unity which both transcends and is required by determinateness; religiously, this means that God is pure spontaneity, utter creativity, sim- ple unity who abides with intentionality, and, while transcendent, is amenable to projection, in appropriate forms, upon other levels of con- sciousness. In affirming a "transordinal" and "transcategorial" God, Dumery rejects "par- ticipation" (for which he substitutes a Ploti- nus-derived doctrine of "procession") as the relation between the divine and the human order. And he selects "henology" over "ontol- ogy" as the structure by which transcendence is explicated. God, then, is not in continuity with being, since being does not "appear" until one reaches the level of the created, the mul- tiple, the finite, and the imperfect (p. 87). Rather, the One transcends being just as spon- taneity falls outside the proper range of the order called "reflection." However, in order to safeguard the distinction from developing into a thoroughgoing dualism, Dumery pro- poses a form of reciprocity whose purpose is to insure "that the inferior receives from the superior the means to be what the superior is not" (p. 89). "Knowledge" of God, therefore, will be construed as an accurate implemen- tation of the "procedures at the disposal of consciousness for both realizing itself and re- lating itself to its principle, accomplishing it- self, and offering itself" (p. 104). All of this is an articulation of the central affirmation: the spirit produces the theistic affirmation, and the philosopher judges or criticizes it. These are provocative responses to large and persistent issues. There is no question but that our author has utilized a vast range of new materials in approaching perennial problems in strikingly creative ways. It is not enough, for example, that he should simply undertake an exposition of the problems concerning the reality of God and the relation between reli- gion and philosophy: Dumery possesses the further ingenuity (indeed, the audacity!) to couple them and to make them interdependent. And this, it appears, is somewhat unfortunate. The reader's criticism in this regard must be qualified by the recognition that The Problem of God in Philosophy of Religion is one seg- ment of a more comprehensive religious phi- losophy; hence, seen as part of a larger whole, the topics dealt with in this particular book seem more congenial to one another than they could were one to attempt to establish their affinities on the basis of this singular effort. This will account in part for the abruptness the reader senses when a phenomenologically ori- ented approach to methodology in religion moves with such apparent alacrity to typical Neoplatonic jargon and interests. Surely Ploti- nus is not yet quite that implicit in the phi- losophy of religion for which attention to in- teriority, intentionality, and distinct levels of consciousness is responsible; or, if he is, then the difference between the understanding of reduction by Husserl and Dumery is much greater than this particular writing indicates it to be. By referring an unusually novel per- spective to concerns for a "monstration" for the reality of God, Dumery appears to have placed his critical methodology in almost crip- pling dependence upon the results it may or may not be able to achieve vis-h-vis a problem for which it, perhaps, is not quite ready. We suspect that the God issue enters by another door and would not have been introduced in</page><page sequence="4">310 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION precisely this way had its appearance depended strictly upon phenomenological directives. It appears to this reviewer, therefore, that materials of extreme suggestiveness and erudi- tion will perhaps pass unrecognized because of the overcomplicated context in which they oc- cur: a context which not only joins Neopla- tonism with a refined Edmund Husserl within a tradition issuing from Descartes and further shaped by Maurice Blondel and in deference to Thomistic doctrine, but which also makes an articulation of the relations between religion and philosophy almost incidental to an argu- ment for the reality of God which attempts to steer clearly and cleanly between all forms of agnosticism and anthropomorphism on the basis of a transcendence which is neither ob- jectivistic nor illusory. Much of the apparent overcomplication derives from the English lack of familiarity with the French literature (as Courtney notes, Dumery makes only one bibli- ographical reference to an English author), which is assumed in the theological and philo- sophical problems which are addressed. But, beyond that, this virtual proliferation of thought in manifold directions is what one might expect to result from a starting point of such provocation. Now that the field has been cited and its pathways charted Dumery's students must cultivate a caution, a temperate- ness, perhaps even a reverence, which is un- willing to avoid penetrating all leads, step by step, and measure by measure.
