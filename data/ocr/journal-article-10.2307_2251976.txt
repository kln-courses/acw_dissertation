<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-TELEOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS By ROLF GRUNER THE purpose of this paper is to point out some of the differences between teleological and functional explanations. To do sor seems to be of some importance since so far many authors have written about this topic in such a way as to imply that both kinds of explanations are more or less the same. Professor Nagel, e.g. lists ' IIunctional or teleological explanations' as the third of four types of explanations, and in a chapter on biology his first section bears the title 'The Structure of Teleological Explana- tions' while actually containing a lucid analysis of functional explanations.' The reason for this is obvious: in both cases, it seems, we are concerned with what has been called ' goal-direct activities', i.e. a teleological explanation is understood to specify ' a goal or end towards the attainment of which the event or activity is a means ',2 and so is thought to include functional explanations. But having started with this concept of a specific type of explana- tion what usually follows is a sub-division distinguishing between (a) cases in which the goal is consciously pursued and (b) cases in which it is not consciously pursued. This, however, is accom- panied by some uneasiness for it is generally assumed nowadays that only in the sphere of human actions are we justified to speak of goals and purposes, whether conscious or not, and to say that also in other fields behaviour can be goal-directed has too much of an anthropomorphic flavour. To avoid this difficulty the word ' functional' comes in very handy and by using it the associa- tions with purposes, desires, intentions, etc., are eliminated. So in the end functional explanations become teleological explana- tions but purged of all teleological content so far as this is pos- sible: ' We shall therefore assume that teleological or functional statements in biology normally neither assert nor presuppose in the materials under discussion either manifest or latent purposes, aims, objectives, or goals.' 3 But does it really make sense to introduce the name 'teleolo- gical explanation' only to throw out later on, when it comes to the field of non-human activities, nearly everything that makes an explanation teleological ? I propose that it does not make 1 Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science, London, 1961, pp. 23, 401. 2 Richard Bevan Braithwaite, Scientific Explanation, Repr., New York, 1960, pp. 322-323. 3Nagel, op. cit. p. 402. 516</page><page sequence="2">TELEOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS 517 sense and that it is better to distinguish from the start between two different kinds of explanations in their own right, teleological and functional, and I shall try to show that such a procedure would also be justified from a logical point of view. First, then, let us explain what in the following is meant by a teleological and by a functional, explanation. By a teleological explanation I understand an explanation in terms of purposes, desires, motives, intentions, etc., and since, strictly speaking, only human beings can have purposes, desires, motives and intentions teleological explanations are only to be found in the field of human actions. I am, of course, aware that often words like ' purpose ' are also applied in other fields, e.g. to artefacts, social institutions and even to objects of nature, but here I shall delimit their use in the sense indicated. Further, I think that in the light of some modern psychological theories we are justified in using' purpose ', 'motive', 'desire', etc., not only in those cases where an end is consciously pursued by a human agent but also where it is sub- consciously pursued. The explanation in the latter case will then be in terms of the psychological theory adopted and will stand and fall with this theory. But in this respect there is no differ- ence from many non-teleological explanations. By a functional explanation I understand here an explanation in terms of the contribution made by something, a thing or a process, to the future maintenance of a system of which it is a part, or to the future maintenance of the present state of such a system. This needs some clarification. It is obvious that there are many uses of the word 'function '.1 The mathematical sense has to be excluded from the start but even in an example like 'The function of a saw is to cut wood' the word does not refer to any system, unless one labours very hard to find one. Never- theless, I think we can restrict the meaning of 'function' in respect to functional explanations to 'function within a system' for the simple reason that this is the meaning nearly everybody has in mind when he speaks of a functional explanation. As to the type of system I shall make no restrictions. The function may occur within a mechanical, biological, social or any other system. The reasons why actually functional explanations are found foremost in biology and the social sciences and hardly anywhere else do not concern us here. What is important, how- ever, is that in teleological explanations as specified above the reference to systems is absent: 'John went to the bank' is explained by pointing out that "It was his purpose to cash a 1 Nagel, ibid. pp. 522-526, lists six, pointing out that his list is by no means exhaustive.</page><page sequence="3">518 R. GRUNER: cheque ' but it can hardly be explained by saying that the action had a function within a system. Of course, the regular habit of visiting banks exhibited by a certain group of people may serve a certain function in the social system concerned but it would be far-fetched to assert that John Smith's visit to a branch of Lloyds in London on 3.10.1959 had such a function. As a rule, it hardly makes sense to replace words like ' purpose ', ' desire ', *'_ inten- tion ', etc., in a teleological explanation by the word 'function' while on the other hand it does make sense to replace 'function' in a functional explanation by ' purpose ', whereby, however, a shift in meaning is unavoidable. Instead of ' The function of the heart in a human body . . .' it is quite possible to speak of ' The purpose of the heart in a human body. . .'; everybody will know roughly what is meant. It has frequently been pointed out that any explanation which is teleological in the old and wider sense which includes 'func- tional ', can be translated into a non-teleological one without any change being involved logically.' This is perfectly true but it is not enough. For asserting only this, one suggests that both kinds of explanations, teleological and functional, can be rendered into the same type of non-teleological explanation, and this is true only in certain respects but fails in others. Let us see why. The common type of a deductive explanation of a singular fact or event is also called 'causal explanation' in that one or more of the initial conditions appearing in the explicans can be re- garded as a cause of the fact or event stated in the explicandum. To take an example from Professor Popper, 'This thread broke' can be explained by stating at least one universal law (' Whenever a thread is loaded with a weight exceeding that which character- izes its tensile strength it will break ') and two singular state- ments serving as initial conditions (' The weight characteristic for this thread is 1 lb.' and 'The weight put on this thread was 2 lbs.'). From a conjunction of the law and the initial conditions, i.e. from the explicans, follows deductively the explicandum, and the explanation is said to be causal in that 'the initial conditions describe what is usually called the " cause " of the event in question. (The fact that a load of 2 lbs. was put on a thread with a tensile strength of 1 lb. was the " cause " of its breaking.)' 2 1 Authur Pap, An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science, London, 1963, p. 360; also Nagel, op. cit. p. 421. 2 Karl Raimund Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, London, 1959, p. 60; similar Carl G. Hempel and Paul Oppenheim, 'The Logic of Scien- tific Explanation ' (article repr.) in Herbert Feigl and May Brodbeck, Eds., Becadings in the Philosophy of Science, New York, 1953, p. 325.</page><page sequence="4">TELEOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS 519 It can be shown that a teleological, but not a functional, explana- tion follows exactly this pattern. 'John went to the bank' can be explained teleologically by stating that 'It was his purpose to cash a cheque '. Instead of adopting the doctrine of final causes by saying that the later action ' cashing a cheque ' caused the earlier one ' going to the bank ' it is now commonly acknowledged that the purpose, desire or intention, to cash a cheque should be regarded as a psychological state which, together with other factors, causes the action ' going to the bank '. This means that we have a perfectly efficient cause existing, in John's mind, before the effect takes place. That it would be wrong to see in ' cashing a cheque' the cause of' going to the bank' also follows from the fact that it is by no means certain that the later action takes place at all. John might have an accident and never reach the bank; he might change his mind on the way; he might forget his cheque-book, etc. In this case we would be left with the effect, ' going to the bank', without a cause, ' cashing a cheque'. So we have to regard the purpose as a cause and the action as an effect, and if we do this the whole acquires the form of a normal deductive causal explanation in which the explicans -con- sists of at least one universal statement (L), e.g., - L1 Anyone who has some money on an account at the bank can cash a cheque. L2 Anyone who wants to cash a cheque has to go to the bank. Ls Anyone with sufficient time and opportunity can go to the bank. and at least one initial condition (C), e.g. C( John had some money on an account at the bank. C2 John wanted to cash a cheque. C3 John had sufficient time and opportunity to go to the bank. From L1-L3 and C1-C3 jointly the explicandum 'John went to the bank' can be deduced by modus ponens. What is important is that the original teleological statement p, 'It was John's pur- pose to cash a cheque ' appears now in different form as an initial condition, under C2. And since the initial conditions together can be regarded as the cause of the fact expressed in the explicandum, C2, and thereby also p, states part of the cause. What, however, is the position when the fact to be explained is not singular but general ? In this case one usually speaks of the 'explanation of a law' and the name ' causal explanation' is not applied. Teleological explanations of general facts are perfectly possible although rather rare. To choose a simple example, the fact that ' All Europeans wear clothes' (E) can be explained by saying that ' It is their purpose to protect themselves</page><page sequence="5">520 R. GRUNER: against the cold' (p). There are other purposes as well but we can ignore these. If this explanation is set out formally we get a deduction L1 Whoever wants to protect himself against the cold wears clothes. L2 All Europeans want to protect themselves against the cold. E All Europeans wear clothes. iR which the conclusion follows by Hypothetical Syllogism from the premisses. p appears here in different form under L2 while L1 has been added as a further premiss. The question is whether in this case too the purpose stated under L2 can be regarded as a cause of the fact expressed in the explicandum. Can we say that one law is a cause of another law or, to be more exact, that the general fact stated in one law causes the general fact stated in another law ? I think we can, for if we employ causal language at all there is no reason why only singular facts should be regarded as having causes, not general facts. If John's purpose to cash a cheque can be regarded as a cause of John's going to the bank then, surely, there is no reason why the Europeans' purpose to protect themselves against the cold should not be regarded as a cause of their wearing clothes. So irrespective of whether a singular or a general fact is expres- sed in the explicandum the position can be summed up as follows: (I) In a teleological explanation a fact or event e stated in an explicandum E is explained by pointing out a purpose P which e is supposed to serve. P can be regarded as one of the causes of e, e as one of the effects of P. P is stated in the explicans from which the explicandum E can be deduced, i.e. the explicans of E contains a statement of at least one of the causes of e (of a necessary condition of e). As to the analysis of a functional explanation, this is somewhat 'more complex. In more recent publications on the philosophy of science it is generally recognized that 'to specify a function served by a process is merely to call attention to an effect of the process.' In other words, 'A serves the function F' is logically equivalent to ' A is a cause of F ' or ' F is an effect of A ' which translated into non-causal language yields 'A is a necessary con- dition of F ' -or ' F is a sufficient condition of A ' which in turn are equivalent to 'F, only if A' or' If F, then A'. So the state- ment ' The presence of chlorophyll in a plant serves the function of enabling the plant to perform photosynthesis ' has logically the same meaning as ' A plant's performance of photosynthesis is an effect of the presence of chlorophyll in the plant ' as well as ' If a</page><page sequence="6">TELEOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS 521 plant performs photosynthesis, then chlorophyll is present in the plant'. From this exercise in successive translation the differ- ence between a teleological and a functional explanation can be seen already. However, let us go into the matter in some more detail. To do so the distinction between an explanation of (a) a singular fact and (b) a general fact is again of importance. If the func- tional explanation concerns, e.g. the presence of beating hearts in human beings then the information asked for may be universal ('Why do all human beings have beating hearts ? ') or particular in scope ('Why does this particular human being have a beating heart ? ', e.g. ' Why do I have a beating heart ? '). A further distinction to be made is that between (1) functional explanations which, so to speak, come straight to the point by declaring directly that the item to be explained serves the function to main- tain the system of which it is a part,' and (2) those which proceed in an indirect way by pointing out one or more processes which in their turn ensure the maintenance of the system. ' The presence of a beating heart serves the function of maintaining life' is an example for a 'direct', 'The presence of a beating heart serves the function of circulating the blood and, thereby, of maintaining life ' an example for an ' indirect ' functional explanation. If the cases (1), (2) and (a), (b) are combined with each other we get the following four functional explanations: (la) E All human beings have beating hearts is explained by F The presence of a beating heart serves the function of maintaining life. (lb) E This human being has a beating heart is explained by F The presence of a beating heart serves the function of maintaining life. (2a) E All human beings have beating hearts is explained by F The presence of a beating heart serves the function of circulating the blood and, thereby, of maintaining life. (2b) E This human being has a beating heart is explained by F The presence of a beating heart serves the function of circulating the blood and, thereby, of maintaining life. 1 Or a particular state of a system. This difference need not concern us here. In some cases, moreover, ' system ' and ' state of system ' indicate the same, e,g. the living organism and its living state.</page><page sequence="7">522 R. GRUNER: For all those cases it can be assumed that 'life' is meant in the biological, and not in the theological or any other, sense, i.e. ' human being ' can be replaced by ' human body ' which in turn obviously means here 'living human body' for dead bodies have no beating hearts and, therefore, can be excluded. If it is further borne in mind that ' A serves the function F' is logically equiva- lent to ' F is an effect of A ' or ' If F, then A ' the four cases can be analyzed as follows: Case (la)-E can be reformulated as E(1) If anything is a living human body then it has a beating heart or (if we regard 'living human body' as being equivalent to 'case where the life of a human body is maintained') E(2) If the life of a human bady is maintained then the body has a beating heart. F can be reformulated as F(1) The presence of a beating heart in a living human body is a necessary condition of the maintenance of the life of that body or F(2) If the life of a human body is maintained then the body has a beating heart. E(2) and F(2) are identical, i.e. E and F are equivalent. In other words, (la) is a purely verbal explanation, a pseudo- explanation that explains nothing.' Case (lb)-Let us reformulate F again as F(1) If the life of a human body is maintained then the body has a beating heart. If to F(1) a further statement S The life of this human body is maintained as an additional premiss, then E(1) This human body has a beating heart (a reformulation of E) follows by modus ponens. F(1) (orF) and S together are the explicans while E(1) (or E) is the explicandum, and since F is equivalent to ' One of the effects of a beating heart is the maintenance of life ' we can say that the explicans contains a statement asserting an effect of the fact stated in the explican- dum. 1 I do not assert that in all instances of (la) the explanation is verbal. Moreover, in this instance, i.e. for the example chosen, the explanation is only verbal because no distinction is made between the present and the future maintenance of the system. For my purposes, however, this dis- tinction is not important and, therefore, has been neglected.</page><page sequence="8">TELEOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS 523 Case (2a)-F is an abbreviation of F(1) The presence of a beating heart serves the function of circulating the blood, and the circulation of the blood serves the function of maintaining life. Interchanging the members of this conjunction (FI) can be reformulated as F(2) If the life of a human body is maintained then the blood is circulated in the body, and if the blood is circulated then the body has a beating heart. From this follows by Hypothetical Syllogism E(1) If the life of a human body is maintained the body has a beating heart. In other words, without the addition of a further premiss the explicandum can be deduced from the explicans. Again, if we regard F, the explicans, as stating that one of the effects of a beating heart is the circulation of the blood and that this circu- lation in turn has the effect to maintain life then some of the effects of the fact expressed in the explicandum are stated in the explicans. Case (2b) Here, once more, F has the meaning of F(1) If the life of a human body is maintained then the blood is circulated in the body, and if the blood is circulated then the body has a beating heart. To this one of the following statements is to be added as a further premiss S(1) The life of this human body is maintained S(2) The blood is circulated in this human body E(1) This human body has a beating heart can be deduced. In this case too, with the same interpretation of F as above, the explicans, formed by F and S, can be regarded as stating some of the effects of the fact to be explained, the effects 'circulation of the blood' and 'maintenance of life'. I do not claim that this analysis of functional explanations is in any way exhaustive. The example chosen is highly simplified and it is questionable whether all functional explanations follow exactly the pattern indicated. Many complicating features have have been ignored, e.g. factors of time, place, environment, etc. I also have not taken into account the difference between the maintenance of a system as such and the maintenance of a specific state of a system, and, further, between the necessity of a part of a system for the fulfilment of a certain function and the necessity of a function for the maintenance of a certain system.</page><page sequence="9">524 R. GRUNER: Nevertheless, I think certain conclusions can be drawn. In all the cases apart from the first one we find a clearly deductive pattern but if the explanations are formulated in terms of cause and effect what is contained in the explicans is not a statement of a cause of the fact to be explained, as it is the case with teleo- logical explanations, but an statement of an effect. Functional explanations, therefore, cannot be regarded as causal explana- tions in the sense in which this term is usually understood in the philosophy of science although, of course, they are causal in the wider sense in that they can be formulated in causal language. So instead of the formulation given under (I) we have to say now: (II) In a functional explanation a fact or event e stated in an explicandum E is explained by pointing out a function F which e is supposed to serve. F can be regarded as one of the effects of e, e as one of the causes of F. F is stated in the explicans from which the explicandumn E can be deduced, i.e. the explicans of E contains a stateimient of at least one of the effects of e, of a sufficient condition of e. But (I) and (II) do not indicate all the major differences bet- ween, or, for that matter, all the major similarities of a teleological and a functional explanation. Lef us try, therefore, to show by means of formalization their bare logical structures using the simplest possible cases and the smallest number of premisses as well as ignoring verbal explanations and neglecting the differences between ' direct ' and ' indirect ' functional explanations. I also shall not take into account relations and shall not make any dis- tinction between a singular and an existential proposition taking existential propositions to stand for both. On the other hand, it will be necessary to distinguish between cases where from a statement asserting a another statement asserting b is inferred because a is regarded as a cause, or as an effect, of b and other cases where from an explicit assertion 'a is an effect of b ', or 'a is a cause of b ', another statement asserting b is inferred. Teleo- logical explanations have the pattern of the first, functional explanations of the second kind. Bearing this in mind and look- ing back at the examples and their analysis given above the following can be said: (1) In the case of a teleological explanation of a singular fact we infer a particular statement of the form (3x)+x from at least one other particular statement of the form (3x)0x asserting that (3x)0x states a cause of the fact stated in (3x)0x. In order to give the explanation the structure of a valid deductive argument, i.e., in order to make it 'complete', at least one universal premiss of the form (x)(+x D bx) has to be added:</page><page sequence="10">TELEOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS 525 (x)(qx :) Ox) (added) (3x)0x (cause) .'. (3x)+x (2) In the case of a functional explanation of a singular fact we infer a particular statement of the form (3x)0x from at least one universal statement of the form (x)(+x D bx) which explicity states that the fact expressedhby (3x)Ox has a certain effect. In order to complete the explanation at least one particular premiss of the form (3x)+x has to be added: (x)(qx :) 3bx) (effect) (3x)ox (added) ... (3x)0x (3) In the case of a teleological explanation of a general fact we infer a universal statement of the form (x)(+x : wox) from at least one other universal statement of the form (x)(0x D bx) asserting that (x)(0x D bx) states a cause of the fact expressed in (x)(+x O wox). For completion of the explanation at least one further universal premiss of the form (x)(+x D ox) is necessary: (x)(qx D bx) (cause) (x)(bx ( ox) (added) (X)(0X D Xx) (4) In the case of a functional explanation of a general fact we infer a universal statement of the form (x)(ox D ox) from at least one other universal statement of the form (x)(bx D (ox) which explicitly states that the fact expressed by (x)(ox :) wx) has a certain effect. In order to make the explanation complete at least one further universal premiss of the form (x)(0$x D x) has to be added: (x)(qx D bx) (added) (x)(Ox D (ox) (effect) .f. (x)(q(x D xx) From (1) to (4) the following conclusions can be drawn: (A) Teleological and functional explanations are both incom- plete deductive arguments where the explicans serves as conclusion. (B) However, a teleological explanation is an inference from a cause to an effect while a functional explanation is an infer- ence from an effect to a cause. (C) While in a teleological explanation the cause is simply stated, 'a', not ' a is a cause of b', in a functional explanation it is</page><page sequence="11">526 R. GRUNER explicity stated that ' b has an effect a ', and not simply ' a'. I.e. teleological explanations have the structure 'a. There- fore b ' but functional explanations assert ' b has an effect a. Therefore b ', or ' b serves a function a. Therefore b '. (D) From (C) it follows that in a teleological explanation the cause can be expressed either in a particular statement, if a singular fact is to be explained, or in a universal statement, if a general fact is to be explained, while in a functional explanation the effect can only be expressed in a universal statement. (E) Comparing the cases (1) to (4) with each other it can be seen that (1) has the same structure of a deductive argument as (2) and (3) the same as (4). But, assuming the arguments to have two premisses each, we also find that in case (1) the cause is expressed in the existential and in case (2) the effect is expressed in the universal premiss while in case (3) the cause is expressed in the minor and in case (4) the effect is expressed in the major premiss. In short, although teleolo- gical and functional explanations have the same deductive pattern, cause and effect are always stated in different parts of the explicans. So teleological and functional explanations set out as argu- ments have the same structure. But that is not a sufficient reason to consider them to be basically the same, for if that were the case then several types of explanations listed in the textbooks as different should be regarded as identical. If we meet with a teleological or functional explanation in science, or, for that matter, in ordinary discourse, it is not a complete explanation in the sense that it is given the form of a complete deductive argu- ment. If it were it would lose immediately its teleological or functional character and become simply deductive. Actually, the explanation is incomplete, an inference from a purpose to an action, i.e. from a cause to an effect, in the case of a teleological explanation, and an inference from a function served to the item that serves the function, i.e. from an effect to a cause, in the case of a functional explanation. In both cases it is, so to speak, as if from -an existing complete deductive explanation for some reason or other only one premiss were selected in order to explain the fact expressed in the conclusion, i.e. in the explicandum. And in the case of a teleological explanation this selection is not the same as in the case of a functional explanation. That is the difference between the two in a nutshell.
