Reader Reactions to German Text Samples EBERHARD FREY, Brandeis University O NE OF THE MAJOR AIMS in teaching literature, especially a foreign literature, I think, is to develop in the student an apprecia- tion for the stylistic quality of a literary work by showing him why and in what way its particular style is good, so that he may eventually be able to make quality judgments about the literature he is reading. But what if teachers themselves cannot agree on what is good style? And, if they agree, will their students agree with them? Are there objective observations that can be made about style, or do all stylistic observations de- pend on individual preferences? In his article "Criteria for Style Analysis"- Word 15 (1959), pp. 154-174-Michael Riffa- terre assumes that even literary scholars vary greatly in their evaluation of a certain style or style feature, but he observes that "once the widely conflicting value judgments are weeded out, we find they all sprang from relatively few points in the text," (p. 166), and that at these points we will usually find a stylistic device or a convergence of stylistic devices, i.e., of "unpre- dictable elements" in the text. With Riffaterre's statements and the questions above in mind, I devised a questionnaire to get a variety of reader responses to ten short samples of German narrative prose. The text samples were chosen to be of similar length and on simi- lar topics in order to facilitate stylistic compari- son. Descriptions of weather and sky can be found in almost any longer narrative, and they are usually independent enough to be read and understood as small units by themselves. Using this general topic, I tried to choose text samples which I considered widely differing in style and literary quality, including well-known authors as well as relatively obscure ones, even some trans- lations. All style samples, however, were taken from twentieth-century authors in order to avoid as much as possible any misinterpretation of forms which have now become archaisms or 310</page><page sequence="2">WHAT IS GOOD STYLE? cliches. The identity of the texts was not given so as not to influence the judgment of those re- sponding to the text, and it will not be given here until the end of this article to permit the reader to view the results without prejudice and, if he wishes, to compare the results of his own analysis of the sample texts with the findings of this in- vestigation. Here are the text samples and the question- naire as they were presented to the participants in the survey. It is important for the understand- ing of this paper that they be read carefully and kept in mind. Style Samples: DESCRIPTIONS OF WEATHER AND SKY I In der Morgendiammerung war ein Gewitter nieder- gegangen und hatte die Nacht mit weissen Fackeln und dr6hnenden Posaunen verabschiedet. Nun spriihte das Sonnenlicht uiber die alte Weide und sprang in griinen Wellen an den H;angezweigen nieder. Der erste volle Tag des Neugeborenen hatte mit Pracht und Glanz begonnen, (...) II Der Regen ist hier absolut, grossartig und er- schreckend. Diesen Regen schlechtes Wetter zu nennen, ist so unangemessen, wie es unangemessen ist, den brennenden Sonnenschein schones WXetter zu nennen. Man kann diesen Regen schlechtes Wetter nennen, aber er ist es nicht. Er ist einfach Wetter, und Wetter ist Unwetter. Nachdrucklich erinnert er daran, dass sein Element das Wasser ist, fallendes Wasser. Und Wasser ist hart. III Blutig ist die Sonne untergegangen, silbern und blass schwimmt der Mond hervor... Der Himmel spiegelt sich in kristallklarem Wasser. Das Spiegelbild sieht schoner aus und echter als der Himmel selbst. Leider wird es zu oft zerrissen! Der leiseste Windhauch verzerrt und zerreisst das Bild ... Leise raschelt das Laub, leise rauscht das Wasser ... Leise atmen die Blumen ... In der Ferne trillert leise ein Vogel... IV Eine Woche lang hatte sie (.. .) gearbeitet an dem Drachen, den sie nun tanzen liess an dem riesigen zerschrundeten Himmel iiber ihnen. Er war sehr hoch, ein schriages Blauviereck mit einem gelben Schwanz. Wenn Sonne aufkam, leuchtete der ganze Himmel wegen des Drachens, und ihre Augen wur- den unruhig: die Wolkengebirge erschienen dann ganz weiss, kunstreich waren die Grate gebaut mit ihren Randern, sie waren raumlich, betretbar. V Schnee war ilberall, und der Himmel war grau, und da unter ihm lag der Hof, (.. .) Da begann es zu schneien, und er ging schnell den Weg wieder zuruck, als furchte er, der Schnee, der schnell und dick herabwirbelte, kinnte das Haus mit einer weis- sen Haube ganzlich zudecken, und dann miisste er in der Nacht unter dem blauen, kalten Himmel wie ein Hund immer rund um das Haus traben, eine Gasse rund um das Haus traben, rund um den braunen Ofen tief drinnen im Herzen des Hauses. VI Es war ein Tag heller Winterdiammerung mit Nebel und Gestober. Der Atem des Raumes um die Dinge und Menschen war flockig und milchig sichtbar geworden. Die Uhr schien stillzustehen: als brachte der frihe Abend in den schneeverhangenen Nach- mittag die weisse, weite Zeitlosigkeit. VII Es war Sommer. Als der Abend kam, fiihlte man die Luft gerade so warm wie das Gesicht und die Hlande, und wenn man im Gehen die Augen schloss, glaubte man sich aufzuloisen und ohne Grenzen zu schweben. VIII Herrlich ging die Sonne auf. Zuerst erschienen ein paar blassrosa Strahlen auf den Wolken, die be- wegungslos unendlich hoch am Himmel standen. Dann farbte sich das Licht allmihlich r6ter und breitete sich langsam aus. Und indem es immer weitere Bereiche eroberte, wuchs der Glanz zu tiefem Purpur. Jetzt schien der Schauplatz bereit zu sein fur die Majestat der Sonne, denn im nachsten Augenblick stieg sie hervor in feuriger Pracht, und der ganze Himmel im Osten entbrannte wie ein Flammenmeer. 311</page><page sequence="3">EBERHARD FREY IX Wenn mir Horen und Sehen verging in Rom, kam der Schirokko und hatte iiber den Adlerwind aus den Bergen gewonnen. Die Sonne trug dann ein Hemd und leuchtete in falschem Licht. Es ist die Zeit, in der die Ungliucke zunehmen und ein liebloses Wort leicht gesprochen wird. Denn der warme Wind greift zuriick auf die Wiiste. Manchmal lasst er's wissen, streut roten Sand ilber die erschlaffte Stadt und haucht sie an, dass sie besinnungslos wird. x Das gute Wetter hielt an. Weiss, hart und sauber, in Windstille und lichtem Frost, in blendender Helle und bliulichem Schatten lag die Gegend, lagen Berge, Haus und Garten, und ein zartblauer Him- mel, in dem Myriaden von flimmernden Leuchtkir- perchen, von glitzernden Kristallen zu tanzen schie- nen, wolbte sich makellos iiber dem Ganzen. QUESTIONNAIRE ON "STYLE SAMPLES" Personal data: Name: Mr./Mrs./Miss Age: Country of birth: Time spent in German speaking country (if any): Cities or areas where you spent major portions of that time: Last time you were in a German speaking country: Do you have German speaking parents? Do you speak German at home?

Read the sample passages carefully once (or several times, if you wish): Which passage do you like best , second best , least ? (Give spontaneous answers). 2. On the basis of your general impression about its stylistic quality, grade each passage by giving it up to a maximum of 10 points (do not hesitate to give low grades), and characterize each passage with one or a few words (e.g., factual, cool, sober, confusing, humorous, sentimental, depressing, stilted, artistic, tense, etc.). (You may use German). 312</page><page sequence="4">WHAT IS GOOD STYLE? 3. In each sample passage, underline every stylistic device that you recognize as such, and any word or phrase or grammatical construction that strikes you for some reason (positively or negatively), give a number to each device (you might have to repeat the number if a device consists of several parts), char- acterize it with one or two words (e.g., beautiful image, short sentence, unusual metaphor, "mot juste," ambiguous wording, parallelism, rhyme, exclamation, etc.), you may use German, and indicate by +, -, or 0 whether you think that this particular device improves, diminishes, or is neutral to the stylistic quality of that passage. Add general style features under a), b), c), etc. (Use attached sheets).

If your close stylistic analysis of the passages caused changes in your opinion expressed under (2.), add revisions above in brackets. The personal data were necessary to find out ed- ucational and language background. Names were optional, and students of mine were told their an- swers would have no bearing on their grades. The first question is intended to elicit spontaneous subjective reactions. With the second question I sought the kinds of general, impressionistic de- scriptions and evaluations of the texts that are quite common in literary discussions. The third and most extensive question is aimed at getting readers' responses which might lead to the clear identification of stylistic devices in the text. At the same time the reader is forced to take a closer look at the text, getting a chance to revise his ini- tial impression, if necessary. The fourth question provides for such revisions. Of about 180 questionnaires distributed 82 were completed and returned, most of them by students of mine, but a sizable number by col- leagues in the field of German literature (12 per- sons) and by native speakers of German in a va- riety of other professions (31 persons). All par- ticipants had some advanced education beyond the secondary school level and 28 persons had the equivalent of a B.A. or higher. Since all par- ticipants had at least the equivalent of six semes- ters of college German, we can safely assume that they all had been exposed to a fair amount of contemporary German prose. For purposes of comparison I have divided the participants into three basic groups. Group 1 (30 persons) consists of native speakers of German who have spent 17 or more years in a German speaking country and of university instructors in German who studied for several years in Ger- many. Group 2 (32 persons) consists of students of German in Canada and the United States who have spent their early years (up to age 14) in Germany or speak German at home or have learned to speak German fluently and have had a chance to practice it in a German speaking coun- try for at least 1 year. Group 3 (20 persons) con- sists of students who, after 3 to 4 years of college German (or the equivalent), have a good class- room knowledge of the language. I am limiting my presentation of the results to a number of graphs, because they are easier to in- terpret and less space-consuming than long col- umns of numbers and percentages.l 1 For a more extensive and detailed documentation of a similar survey see Chapter II of my book: Franz Kafkas Erzdhlstil: eine Demonstration neuer stilanalytischer Methoden an Kafkas Erzihllung "Ein Hungerkinstler" (Bern: Lang, 1970). 313</page><page sequence="5">EBERHARD FREY No.of Persons 30- 25 20 15 10 5 o LI'm 'mm I F"1 I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X Text I i Best W^M/X// Second Best Least FIGURE 1. Preference Ratings of the Text Samples by all Subjects. Figure 1 shows the results from Question 1 compounded from all 82 participants. The height of the columns corresponds to the number of per- sons who have liked a certain text best, second best or least. Our first observation is that there is no unity in the judgment about the texts, each of the 10 samples is both liked as well as disliked by one or more of the participants. The only clear tendency seems to be the positive evaluation of Text VII. This text is the shortest of all and con- centrates on one sensual impression. "Good sen- sory image, poetic, clear and simple" are the most frequent comments to this text. Maybe it is too short to reveal potentially irksome idiosyn- cracies. Or is it the prime example of universally acceptable good style? Texts II, III, and VIII appear to be the most controversial because they are mentioned consid- erably more often, positively or negatively, than any of the other texts. A look at the readers' comments seems to indicate that these texts ap- peal to certain strong emotions in the readers, and their reaction to this emotional appeal is ei- ther strongly positive or strongly negative. The comments range from "striking, sober, cool" to "depressing, monotonous, inane" for Text II; from "beautiful, majestic, artistic" to "trite, pompous, nauseating" for Text VIII; from "sen- sitive, lyrical, dreamy" to "sentimental, cliche, trash" for Text III. Thus it may not come as a complete surprise that the most liked text (VIII) and the most disliked text (II) are among these three controversial texts. One preliminary conclu- sion may be that both the chances and the risks of reader acceptance are higher for strongly emo- tional texts. But it is also important to remember that each of these three texts receives a good share of strongly opposing voices: the texts liked best and least by a majority of readers are also the most controversial ones. A closer observation of the readers' reactions within the three lan- guage proficiency groups shows that Group 2 and 3 do the major share of praising Text VIII and condemning Text II, while Group 1 is mainly re- sponsible for the "least" ratings of Texts III and VTIII, but even within each group there is no full agreement about these texts. Besides the three most controversial style sam- ples, Texts VII and IV get a good deal of atten- tion, however, their evaluation is more clearly positive than that of the other three. Comments to these texts are much more detached; "good sensory image, poetic, clear and simple" for Text VII, "artistic, factual, vivid image" for Text IV are words with little emotional connotation. Most comments on the remaining texts are similarly detached, with the exception of the occasional use of such adjectives as "depressing" and "mel- ancholy" concerning Texts V and IX and of "pompous" and "stilted" about Text I. The lat- ter text, by the way, is the one mentioned least among the ten texts. It has one peculiar charac- teristic in common with Texts V and VI: while their ratings as "best" are somewhat higher than their ratings as "least," they have their highest ratings as "second best." This, if at all signifi- cant, appears to be the mark of good craftsman- ship: most readers find these texts fairly good but few are particularly disgusted or enraptured by their style. In general, reader responses to Question 1 seem to support the wide-spread assumption that style judgments are a matter of individual taste and therefore always controversial. One of the main objectives of this article is to qualify such an assumption. The relatively uniform responses to Text VII already indicate an exception to the rule, and more such distinct patterns of prefer- ence appear within the three language proficiency groups. These patterns will be more closely in- ^i ^'^ ll I I 314 'M</page><page sequence="6">WHAT IS GOOD STYLE? vestigated in the discussion of Question 2. An- other aspect of the reader responses to Question 1 is that, in spite of the disagreements in value judgments, we can get an idea about the amount of attention that each of the texts receives. If we give one point for each mention of a text as "best" or "least" and half a point to each men- tion of "second best," the texts will rank in the following order: II (38), VIII (33.5), III (26), IV (20.5), VII (20), IX (16.5), V (15.5), X (15), VI (12.5), I (9). The same principle of analysis can be applied to the reader responses solicited by Question 3: the number of underlinings which each word or phrase receives by a group of readers is indica- tive of the amount of attention this word or phrase has drawn from the readers, be it positive or negative. Since Riffaterre sees literary style as an "emphasis" ("Criteria," p. 155), which is ba- sically designed to catch the reader's attention and to focus it on certain points in the text, we should be able to use the number of underlinings to identify stylistic devices in a text, and to de- termine their relative intensity, i.e., effectiveness. In a previous extensive study of such underlin- ings (cf. Franz Kafkas Erzdhlstil, pp. 110-142), I have already demonstrated that, in spite of all the conflicting value judgments, there is strong agreement among readers on which portions of a text they underline. Thus a definite pattern of emphases, of stylistic devices with different de- grees of intensity, emerges from each text. Such emphatic patterns are vital for the interpretation and understanding of a text. It is beyond the scope of this article to analyze all the reader responses to Question 3 in detail- they provide enough material for several separate investigations-, but Figure 2 may give an idea of the kind of agreement in the readers' underlin- ings. I have deliberately chosen the least "contro- versial" (Text I) and one of the most "contro- versial" (Text VIII) of the ten sample texts. The width of the black bands under the text corre- sponds-on a percentage basis-to the number of underlinings each word received by members of Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 respectively. Thus, for instance, in Text I, the word niederge- gangen was underlined by 17 members (52 per- cent) of Group 1, 21 members (66 percent) of Group 2, and 10 members (50 percent), of Group 3, while Posaunen was underlined by 30 members (100 percent), 32 members (100 per- cent) and 18 members (90 percent) of the re- spective groups. We find strong agreement of the underlinings, not only within each group, but also among the three groups, and we can clearly identify a number of places in the text where sty- listic devices must be present. This agreement appears to be equally strong in the "controver- TEXT: 1 In der Morgendammerung war ein Gewitter niedergegangen und Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 _I _ _ _ _ II F W m hatte die Nacht mit weissen Fackeln und drohnenden Posaunen verabschiedet.

In addition, we can get an idea of the intensity or effectiveness of the stylistic devices in the text. For example, the metaphoric use of spriihte elic- ites almost universal response, the mot juste niedergegangen with Gewitter strikes a majority of readers, and, even though only a minority (40 percent) appreciates the almost technical pre- cision of the coinage Hingezweige, it still has a definite stylistic impact. We have strong agreement of readers on the presence or absence of style in the sense of stylis- tic "emphasis"; little agreement in their value judgment about style: how is it possible that some of the works from which the ten samples are taken met with much wider acclaim than oth- ers? Are the sample passages too short to reveal stylistic quality? Or is it the taste of specific in- dividuals or groups that determines the fate of a work? Our discussion of Question 1 did raise the pos- sibility of certain tendencies of evaluation if we group the readers according to language profi- ciency. Other groupings according to age, sex, ed- ucation, profession might bring out different ten- dencies. Question 2 is designed to bring these tendencies into better focus. Here the reader does not just concentrate on what he considers the best and worst text, therefore his evaluations of the "intermediate" texts do not get lost. The ten point evaluation scale allows for a finer gradation of judgment so that the reader can take into ac- count the smaller merits and weaknesses of each individual text. The answers are presumably the result of some deliberation, especially since they include the possible revisions requested in Ques- tion 4. Figure 3 shows the average evaluation of each of the ten texts by all 82 participants. The re- sults were computed from the revised grade points if revisions were made. (The unrevised values are entered with a dotted line.) We can see there is not that much difference in the aver- age ratings of the texts. They fluctuate within a range of a little over 2 points (4.7 to 7.0). As could be expected from the results of Question 1, Text II has the lowest rating. The highest rating, however, does not go to Text VIII but rather to Text VII, which so far has been conspicuous mainly through a relative lack of negative evalu- ation. The eight remaining texts fluctuate within less than 1 point (5.6 to 6.5). When we observe the three groups separately, Points 10- 5- 0 I II III IV V VI vII vIII IX x Texts Revised Values .---.--.

On the other hand, if we divide Group 2 into native speakers and non-native speakers of Ger- man, as shown in Figure 6, we find that the na- tive speakers are in much stronger contrast to the educated Group la than the non-native speakers. This should not surprise us since the non-native speakers spent their relatively short time in a German-speaking country on a much higher edu- cational level than the native speakers, who sel- dom had more than a few years of elementary ed- ucation in Germany. Again, the level of educa- tion appears as the decisive factor. Of course, one could argue that students of German traveling to Germany must be more highly motivated than students who study German becacause they are native speakers, but most of the non-natives in Group 2 also took German because they had been to Germany. The age factor in the style judgments is hard to determine because age and education are strongly interrelated, especially in Groups 2 and 3, which consists almost exclusively of college students with little difference in age. My investi- gations showed no clear-cut distinction of age and education correlations in Groups 2 and 3. Figure 7 shows a comparison of the older and younger members in the highly educated Group la. The older group (12 persons over age 30) has a median age of 33, the younger group (10 per- sons 30 years and under) has a median age of 26.5 years. The two evaluation curves are quite similar, with the exception of Text IV, and maybe Texts V and II (in such small groups changes of about one point are not necessarily significant). The topic of a flying kite in Text IV may just appeal more to the younger group, 10 Group la, over 30 years Group la, under 31 years FIGURE 7. Text Evaluations: Older and Younger Members of Group la. 318</page><page sequence="10">WHAT IS GOOD STYLE? while the differences in Texts V and II, if at all significant, could reflect a genuine stylistic pref- erence of the older group for the predominantly repetitive stylistic devices in these texts. But if we consider the fact that there are twice as many Ph.D.s in the older group than in the younger group, even these differences in evaluation could be ascribed to a difference in education. At any rate, as long as a certain educational standard has been reached, age differences seem to have little effect on style judgments. A commonly voiced assumption is that men and women have different literary tastes. This does not seem to hold true, judging from their reactions to our style samples. Figures 8 and 9 show the comparison of male and female readers as a whole and in Group la respectively. While in general the women readers seem to give slightly higher marks than the men, their relative evaluations are practically the same. In this con- text it seems almost ironic that the women give second lowest rank to Text IX, the only one written by a woman author. Such a faux pas can, of course, not happen to Group la (Figure 9), but the general observations made above also hold true for Group la. In fact, if we consider the small number of persons involved (14 male, 8 female), the similarity between male and female scores appears to be even more striking here.

All in all, whether a reader is male or female appears to have little bearing on his or her evalution of lit- erary style. If style judgments depend mainly on the amount of education a reader has had, the most important aspect of this educational factor must be his exposure to German literature and his training in this field. Figure 10 shows a compari- son between such specialists and the more gener- ally educated reading public. The comparison is restricted to native German speakers in the highly educated Group la: 8 German majors (4 professors and 4 graduate students) vs. 8 mem- bers of other professions. The differences are not very striking: both groups show even more strongly the tendencies already displayed by Group la (cf. Figure 5), but the German majors do so in more cases (Texts I, II, IV, V, VIII, IX, X) than the non-German majors (Texts III, VI, VII), thus providing us with the most highly de- veloped judgment. This, I think, is the outer limit to which we can carry the differentiation of groups of readers without spreading the data too thin. Fortunately, among this group of German professors and graduate students, evaluations are in stronger agreement than in any other group. Thus their evaluations can give us an idea of the literary taste towards which German and foreign students of German literature are educated. 319</page><page sequence="11">EBERHARD FREY 1I III IV V VI VII VIII IX German Majors .. Other Iajors FIGURE 10. Text Evaluations: German Majors and Other Majors Among the Native Speakers of Group la. Figure 11 gives a little evaluation profile for each of the ten sample texts. The profile shows evalutions of a text at four different educational levels. The straight line stands for native speak- ers of German, the dotted line for non-native speakers. In such a profile, not only the stylistic standards of the specialists in German literature are shown, but also the ways in which native and non-native students of German literature ap- proach these standards. The four educational lev- els signify, on the one hand, native speakers of German a) from Group 2, b) from Group lb (which are all native speakers of German), c) from non-German majors in Group la, and d) from German majors in Group la; on the other hand, non-native speakers of German a) from Group 3 (which are all non-native speakers), b) from non-German majors in Group 2, c) from German majors in Group 2, d) from Group 1. These respective groupings appeared to be most closely comparable, even though it is hard to draw comparable lines of demarcation within an educational continuum. For instance, it may ap- pear foolish upon first consideration to pit native German speakers of Group 2 against Group 3, who are all not native speakers. But, as far as German literature is concerned, we have already seen in Figure 6 that they are at a more primitive state of development than the other members of Group 2, and now we see in Figure 11 that in Texts I, II, IV, VIII, IX they may even be at a more primitive state than the members of Group 3. On the other end of the scale, the non-native specialists in German literature have not quite reached the developmental stage of the native specialists in their evaluation of Texts I, II, VIII and X. In this context, the larger discrepancies of evaluation on the intermediate educational levels are probably quite real, but the problems of demarcation have introduced an additional el- ement of chance. Now let us look at the general characteristics of the profiles. We find three basic types: strongly rising (Texts II, IV, IX), about level (Texts V, VI, VII, X) and strongly falling (Texts I, III, VIII). It is interesting to know that the texts with rising profiles, which are rated best by the native specialists of Group la, are written by well-known contemporary writers who made their names in the post-war period, while the four texts with about level profiles were written by more traditional authors who started their ca- reers earlier in the 20th Century. Two of the three texts with strongly falling profiles (Texts III, VIII), which are rated lowest by the native specialists, are translations from a foreign lan- guage and obviously lost some of their original qualities in the process; the third one (Text I) is by a rather obscure German author. Obviously the judgments of the native specialists are closely in tune with the judgments of the modem liter- ary public, even though the sample texts are much too small to reveal concrete evidence of au- thorship. I think it is now appropriate to reveal the names of the authors in a final brief discussion of each individual text. Text I is from Unweit vom Strom by Willi Gutting.2 Some of the young na- tive speakers and most of the non-natives are im- pressed by its rather lush metaphoric language, which however is mostly rejected by the native specialists. Text II is from Irisches Tagebuch by 2 Willi Gutting, Unweit vom Strom: Aus der Chronik der Familie Holsch (Karlsruhe: Volksbund fur Dichtung, 1961), p. 85. 320</page><page sequence="12">WHAT IS GOOD STYLE?

Heinrich Bll.3 Young native readers found this style much too dry and repetitive while both na- tive and non-native specialists had some appreci- ation for the sober and rational approach and found it appropriate to the topic of rain. Text III is from "In der Sommerfrische," a short story by Lejb Perez, translated from Yiddish by Alexan- der Eliasberg.4 Its simple, straightforward sen- tences with certain repetitive patterns are espe- cially appreciated by the less advanced non-na- tives, who occasionally still have to struggle with German syntax, but also by the native speakers on this level, who like its "poetic sensitivity." The latter is seen negatively as "sentimental" on more advanced levels and, on the most advanced level, a few native speakers seem to discover a certain romantic charm in this sentimentality. Text IV, the favorite text on the advanced level, is taken from Uwe Johnson's novel MutmaBung- en iiber Jakob.5 Its carefully chosen metaphoric language gives native and non-native readers a very vivid impression. Ambiguity as to the cor- rect referents of some pronouns in the text cre- ates much confusion on the lower levels.

Some beginners find this feature depressing and confusing, while some "experts" consider it slightly forced. Wilhelm von Scholz wrote Text VI as the beginning of his "Plauderei einer Dammerstunde."7 Readers from the rather ad- vanced Level c liked his impressionistic use of comparisons and metaphors to create an atmo- sphere, but on the "expert" Level d the tortuous logic of the sentence structure was sometimes criticized. The short Text VII is the longest weather description I could find in Robert Musil's "Tonka."s Its clear sensory description of a summer evening receives almost unanimous praise, only a few advanced readers find it a little contrived. The author of Text VIII, Joseph Nemes, is a Hungarian who emigrated to New Zealand. Our selection is from the first book he wrote in English, a religious novel entitled Signs in the Storm (in German: Zeichen im Sturm).9 Its German translation by Dr. E. Gauhe appears to be rather an improvement on the original (see below). Native "specialists" gave it the lowest rating and described it as a collection of pompous cliches. Readers from lower educational levels praised the "artistry" of this "well-balanced, vivid" description. Non-natives followed the same dual tendencies, praise from the less edu- cated, rejection by the more educated, but most felt rather unsure about their judgment. The ex- tended metaphors in Text IX, which is taken from Ingeborg Bachmann's essay "Was ich in Rom sah und h6rte,"1 seem to fascinate the edu- cated readers, but confuse the less educated ones. The specialists, native and non-native, rate it second best. The relatively high rating from the non-native non-German majors on Level c seems to originate more from a feeling of awe than of delight about this text. Text X, a passage from Thomas Mann's "Tristan,""' is the only one for which the evaluation tendencies of native and non-native readers run contrary. While the na- tive readers show a slight decrease in evaluation with increasing education, the non-native readers show strongly increasing scores. It seems that Thomas Mann's artistry, still striking to the non- natives, has lost its novelty appeal. Expressions like "Myriaden von flimmernden Leuchtk6rperc- hen" may already have become cliches. For some "beginners" in German literature, Thomas Mann's elaborate sentences are still too complex. This, at least, is the only way to explain the fre- quent remark in Group 3 that Text X is "confus- ing." So far we have observed correlations between educational levels and stylistic tastes, and we have concluded that tastes change with increas- ing education. But we have not yet observed this process of education and refinement of taste ac- tually going on. While it would be a monumental task to follow all 82 subjects of our investigation through many years of educational and profes- sional development, one seemingly incidental ex- ample for this educational process may more eas- ily serve to corroborate our conclusions. The dot- ted line in Figure 3 shows the average unrevised scores for all the readers. Even though only a small minority of the readers felt the need to re- vise their evaluations, and the resulting changes are almost negligible, it is fascinating to observe that the revisions for all ten texts move in the direction of the values of Group 1. Under the prodding of the questionnaire, the readers had to take a very close look at their texts, and this re- sulted in the "refinement" of some readers' taste without the guidance of an educated opinion.

At first a few rays of reddish light appeared on the clouds that stood motion- less at a tremendous height. Then gradually the light grew redder and spread over a large area. And as it spread there was a display of colours changing continually and finally moulding into a deep, dark red. By then the scene seemed to be set for his lordship the sun, because he came into sight in a glorious flame-like colour, and it looked as if the eastern sky had changed into a burning fire." 10Ingeborg Bachmann, Gedichte.

First of all, it depends on which group of readers a book is intended for. The highly educated reader seems to be strongly impressed by the novelty of stylistic devices. But these have a ten- dency to become traditional and eventually cliches, only appreciated by readers of a lower level of education. It is also the liberal use of stylistic devices that makes texts "controversial" and draws the reader's attention to them, but it does not assure the reader's sympathies. The most durable and most universally accept- able texts appear to be the ones written in a simple, clear, concrete, unaffectated, precise man- ner similar to the selection from Robert Musil's "Tonka." What have we learned about the reader? Along with the basic grammatical mastery of the lan- guage, he already acquires the ability to recog- nize style, i.e., stylistic devices, but only through a long process of education and exposure to liter- ature does he acquire the ability to evaluate and judge style the way the educated literary public does. This does not mean that a small minority of educated readers dictate the official literary taste; it does mean that with increasing literary sophistication a reader becomes hungry for new, unusual stylistic stimuli, for the latest in stylistic refinement, and that he thus contributes to the constant production and rapid turnover of new stylistic devices. In this process, a simple, re- strained style may have the best chances of sur- vival, but the "controversial" style will have the best chances of success in the literary world.l2 12I would like to thank my wife Mitsue for her help in the statistical compilations and graphs, and my col- league, Professor Laura Hourtienne, for her valuable criti- cal comments. American Doctoral Research on the Teaching of Literature JAMES R. CHATHAM, Mississippi State University AND ENRIQUE RUIZ-FORNELLS, University of Alabama THE APPEARANCE in print, in recent years, of bibliographies of dissertations in the fields of lan- guages and literatures indicates phenomenal growth in numbers of those engaged in teaching literature, although few of the titles in these works deal with matters of pedagogy.' The field of foreign language teaching has expanded at doctoral level in a similar manner,2 but attention in this area has been focused almost exclusively on the four basic language skills. The teaching of literature, therefore, has been se- verely neglected in doctoral research. The develop- ment of graduate programs leading to the Master of Arts in Teaching and the Doctor of Arts degrees ap- pears to be an attempt to equip those preparing for a teaching career with instruction and practice in effec- tive classroom techniques. Since this is an area of contemporary concern, a bibliography of disserta- tions already completed on the teaching of literature is urgently needed. The list below, which has been compiled from all known printed sources and numer- ous library card catalogues, is the first accumulation of titles in this area. The entries are arranged in two groups: (I) dis- sertations dealing with any aspect of the teaching of foreign literatures and (II) those written on the teaching of literature in general or literature in En- Howard R.
