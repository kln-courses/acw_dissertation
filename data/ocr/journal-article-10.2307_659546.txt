<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Lower ziger and its Tribes. By ARTHUR GLYN LEONARD. London: Macmillan and Company, Ltd. New York: The Macmillan Company. 19o6. 80, xxii, 564 pp. We wish that we could speak words of unreserved praise for the third of the African books before us, Major Leonard's Lower Nziger anzd its Tribes. But here we have two glaring faults: (i) The author lacks clearness in statement; (2) he aims to give an appearance of profound and technical knowledge to his argument when he would do better to seek the most simple expression of views. Major Leonard has long lived in the region studied, knows the people well, and has thought long and seriously upon his material. The discussion is almost confined to religious ideas and practices, as is shown by the division headings--Section I. Part I. - A geographical and traditional outline. Part II. -The Phi- losophy of the People as expressed in words, names, proverbs, and fables. Part III. - The Natural Religion of the various Tribes. Section II. - The Naturism of the Delta. Section III. - The Dualism of the Natives. Sec- tion IV. - Spirit-land and Spiritualism. Section V.- The Spiritualism of the Physical. Section VI. - Emblemism or the Embodiment of the Spirit. Section VII. - The Ceremonials and Practices of Naturism. Section VIII. - The Demonology of the People as practised in Witchcraft. In the Niger delta dwell many small tribes differing from each other in language, life, and to some extent in religions, though presenting on</page><page sequence="2">6oo AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 9, 1907 the whole a notable uniformity. Major Leonard reduces these many tribes to two chief and original groups - the Ibo and the Bini. Unlike Dennett's Bavili, who are Bantu in speech, these tribes are negroes. akin to those of the Sudan. Still there should be much in common in the religious thought of the Niger delta tribes and the Bavili, and Dennett and Leonard should mutually cast light on dark points. This they really do, and when we find them in accord, or easily harmonized, we are war- ranted in giving weight to their ideas. In Leonard we find no evidence for the vast importance attributed to categories or for the pervasiveness of six as a sacred number, asserted by Dennett. Yet Dennett claims to find the whole system as well defined at Benin as at Kabinda. It seems impossible for one who has gone as deeply into native thought and religion as Leonard, to overlook a series of ideas so important, funda- mental, and pervasive, had they really existed. Here our confidence in Mr Dennett's observations is diminished by disagreement. Among his Bantu friends Mr Dennett finds the sacred grove to be of the utmost sig- nificance and importance, though he does not clearly show why it should be so. Leonard brings out clearly that the tree becomes the receptacle of a dead man's soul and hence is sacred. Here the, agreement of the authors gives confidence to the belief that groves are truly and importantly sacred. When Major Leonard is not clear, it is because he uses too many words, introduces unnecessary clauses, or employs technical or semi-tech- nical terms inexactly; Dennett's obscurity is due to actual obscurity in thought or inability to supply words to keep up with his thought. Major Leonard divides his matter about equally between facts and theories. His theoretical suggestions provoke both thought and dissent. He recognizes, as Dennett does - and in fact all students of African religion seem to do - (a) a chief god, the creator, (b) dualism existing throughout nature, exhibiting itself among other ways in sex ideas and phallicism, and (c) the presence of spiritualism. For him the religion presents itself as an ancestor worship, which recognizes the father-ancestor of the family as the great object of practical worship and maternity as divine. All religious thought and practice center around this. Prayer, sacrifice, fetich-using, idol-making and worship, witchcraft, are all examined and explained with this fundamental conception in mind. For Major Leonard the sacred crocodile is a beast in whom an ancestral spirit is embodied; the idol, made by human hands and usually anthropomorphic, is a spirit's dwelling-place; a fetich (for him a natural, not an artificial object) has been selected as a resting-place by a human spirit. The choice to rest</page><page sequence="3">BOOK RE VIE WS 60 I in another human being, in a tree or other plant, or in an object, may be made and publicly expressed during the life-time of the friend or ancestor, Embodiment in human beings, in plants or in objects, is often desired and desirable. Embodiment in animals is not desired and is due usually to unsought and hostile influences. While thus, Major Leonard is plainly committed to Spencer's gh/os/-theory as distinguished from Tylor's animism, he finds room for animismu (personalism, he perhaps would call it) but considers it subsequent to ancestor and linga cult. While his attitude in this matter is clear, and repeatedly stated, it seems as if his facts can be quite as well fitted with the belief that personalization was coincident with the birth of the idea of one's own separable soul and antecedent to the idea of an ancestral spirit or of embodiment of spirits, ancestral or otherwise, in new resting-places. Of particular interest and abounding in suggestive ideas, new or stated in new form, are the discussions of burial and funeral customs, human sac- rifice, significance of blood, cannibalism, transmigration, embodiment of all sorts, spirit possession, "medicine," twins, and witchcraft. The author makes much use of the term emblemism, which he considers to be the totemism of some authors. Both because of the importance of the question at issue and because the passage fairly represents the author's style and mode of argument, we present his own words: " If the term totem, said to be of Chippeway origin, denotes an object, usually but not invariably an animal, between which and his tribe the savage believes that there exists a close kinship - as according to Dr. J. G. Frazer it does - then totemism expresses in one word the cult as it prevails among one and all of these Delta tribes . " But, however, if totemism implies that the savage in the kinship alluded to traces his descent from the totem in question, irrespective of the fact that it is an animal, vegetable, or material object, then totemism as it is now ac- cepted, and the emblemism of the Delta are two separate or at least different features. For, as I have more than once explained, it is not to the emblem itself, i. e., to the actual animal or object, but to the ancestral spirit inside it- in other words, to the human father with whom the spirit has been associated - that the Delta natives trace their descent. Their belief is that these sym- bols were chosen by their ancestors as suitable and convenient objects to reside in, with a view to repose and adoration, or in accordance with the ruling jurisdiction, and that it is in consequence of this spirit-residence that the emblems are treated as sacred, and not by any means on their own account. . . Speaking merely from general knowledge and a wide experience of Ori- ental and African nationalities, I have no hesitation in stating that, in my humble estimation, totemism, regardless of nationality or race, is nothing more</page><page sequence="4">602 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 9, 1907 or less than emblemism pure and simple, as it now exists among the tribes of the Niger Delta." While we regret the author's diffuseness - he might state all he has to say in one third the space he uses - and while some of his theoretical conclusions fail to appeal to us strongly, we consider the book one of the most serious contributions that has long been made to anthropology and the study of primitive religion.
