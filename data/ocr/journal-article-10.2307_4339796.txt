<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion in Virgil. By Cyril Bailey; pp. 337. Oxford: At the Clarendon Press, 1935. $5.00 Few books published in recent years will be more welcome to the student and teacher of Vergil than Cyril Bailey's Religion in Virgil. Studies on the subject, as Bailey says (Intro- duction 1-4), have been hitherto largely re- stricted to Vergil's conception of Jupiter in his relation to fate and to accounts of the under- world as found in the Sixth Book of the A]neid. Scholars have regarded the anthropomorphic deities merely as part of an 'epic machinery'-a mere literary device. Vergil's allusions to old Italian religious forms and places have hitherto been regarded as mere antiquarian interest on his part. Our author does not disagree in the main with these conclusions, but he does not consider them finally satisfactory because, as he writes (Introduction 1) 'in the works of so im- personal a poet as Virgil it is not easy to dis- tinguish with certainty between belief and interest, between acceptance and understanding, and to say with confidence, "Here we have Virgil the historian and antiquarian, there we see Virgil the man of religious convietion".' Bailey disclaims any notion of discovering Vergil's personal religion: his avowed purpose is 'to conduct a rather more detailed examination than has perhaps hitherto been made into the religious ideas and practices which find their place in his poems,' in the belief that 'just as he designed the 1Eneid to be an epitome of the history and character of the Roman people and of their civilization, as he intended to enshrine in it by way of imitation and recollection what was best and greatest in Roman literature, so on the religious side he wished it, and to a less degree his other poems, to recall beliefs and practices which at one period or another had been alive and vital at Rome or among the Italian peoples.' This, Bailey holds, was no mere antiquarian interest, but was part of the poet's design to forward the fusion of the Greek and Roman elements in religion which it was part of Augustus' purpose to fix. He further suggests that it may have been a part of Vergil's design 'to reconcile or to put into juxtaposition the conclusions of philosophy and the beliefs of the religious tradition' (2). With these purposes in mind, then, our au- thor proceeds to analyse the religious element in Vergil's works. His method should serve as a model for other investigators who plan to analyse the religious element in classical authors -a much needed service for students of Horace, Cicero, Propertius, Petronius and others. First, he divides his subject into four 'strains': 1. the magic and superstitious elements; 2. the belief in 'vague spirits' of place and function-ani- mism-the foundation of the whole Roman re- ligion; 3. the Graeco-Roman anthropomorphism which dominated the State-religion of the Re- public; and 4. the element of philosophy. The Romans themselves, of course, were not aware of the distinction between the first three elements; but it is Bailey's contention that Vergil himself was conscious of the double source of the Graeco-Roman religion of his own day and that he was at pains to separate the Roman from the Greek element. With the oriental cults Vergil will have nothing to do. He, like Augustus, held them in contempt. On this framework, then, Bailey builds his book. He first gives the generally accepted be- liefs with regard to a particular deity or form, avoiding all controversial matters. Then he dis- cusses each subject, meticulously analysing each</page><page sequence="2">CLASSICAL WEEKLY 49 pertinent passage, to determine the magic or superstitious elements, the presence of animism, the purely Roman as distinct from the Greek elements and, finally, summarizes his findings on each subject under discussion. This detailed analysis of all the passages in Vergil's works and the separation of the magic, animistic, Greek and Roman elements is of first-rate importance; but he has made another contribution which is of inestimable value to the student of Vergil. He is not content merely to translate the words omen, auspicium, monstrum, fatum and the like. He studies meticulously in the context each word of religious significance to determine the precise shade of meaning which that context must yield. This material, naturally, is of lexicographical importance, for investigations into the termi- nology of religion are few. His studies, too, are bound to influence text-book makers and trans- lators of Vergil for he clears up many misunder- standings and misinterpretations. For example, he studies the troublesome word numen which means, firstly, the 'will' or 'decree' of the deity and, secondly, the 'deity' itself, not, however, in the sense of deus but in the animistic sense of 'vague power' of place or function. With these two fundamental meanings as a starting point, Bailey determines the specific meaning of the word in its context. Numen, then, comes to be equivalent to deus; the numen of a god may be a mere periphrasis for the deity itself; or numen may mean the 'majesty' 'presence' 'power' 'in- spiration' 'influence' 'oracle' of the deity. Bailey performs the same service for us in the words religio, religiosus, superstitio, sacer, sacratus, sanctus, sollemnis, pius, pietas, piare, piaculum, votum and other troublesome words in Vergil. Bailey hesitates to ascribe definite religious belief to Vergil: the farthest he will go is to conclude that Vergil has an 'affectionate devo- tion' (29) for the old Roman deities and forms. He further, on the philosophical side, believes that to Vergil fate is 'the will of the gods, and the will of the gods finds its expression in the fate which decides a man's actions and sufferings and guides the whole course of events' (226), or, as he says more specifically, 'he is feeling towards a monotheism in which Jupiter is supreme and, like the Stoic world-god, expresses his will in the decrees of fate' (233). To repeat, Bailey has written a book which, this reviewer believes, will set the path for future investigators of the religious element in Greek and Latin authors. He has made a definite con- tribution to our understanding of the religious element in Vergil and has made important addi- tions to the religious lexicography of Vergil. His book is a model of clarity and orderliness although he occasionally falls into a curiously involved sentence structure. Controversial mat- ters are rigidly excluded. There are few refer- ences to modern works on Vergil, although in the body of the text he mentions favorably Lily Ross Taylor's Emperor Worship. 'Religion in Virgil' purports to be an independent study. On the whole it is so, but where other scholars have covered the field before him, as, notably, in the chapter on Fate and the Gods, Bailey naturally leans upon their results; but even here he has shown an originality of treatment and has made a more thorogoing analysis of the passages involved than his predecessors. Every teacher and student of Vergil should have this book on his shelves. ELI E. BURRISS New York University</page></plain_text>
