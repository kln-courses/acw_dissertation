<plain_text><page sequence="1">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE I he tenth book of the laws, which contains Plato's last word on cosmology and theology, has often been considered as presenting Plato's views in a more exoteric way in contrast with the more esoteric style of the Timaeus. And there are good reasons to think that this view is correct. Whereas the Timaeus stresses that "to find the maker and father of this All is difficult, and, having found it, it is impossible to communicate it to the crowd" (28c),1 Plato is in Laws 10 intending to establish a "proemium" (prooimion, 887a-b) or rational foundation for his laws against impiety, which are supposed to be known by all. In this proemium Plato tries to argue for three propositions: (1) that the gods exist (887c-899d); (2) that they take care of human affairs (899d-905d); (3) that they cannot be bribed by sacrifices or prayers (905d-907b).2 The underlying assumption is that learning these facts about the gods will also help to prevent impiety which, like any kind of vice, is often due to ignorance (885b). If this is so, what most surprises us is that Plato does not however have qualms about introducing in this apologetic discourse a reference to an evil soul as an alternative candidate to a good soul ruling over the universe (896e). This has provoked the most varied reactions, from ancient Platonists attributing to Plato a dualism that would ap pear manichean to our eyes, to recent interpreters who have denied that Plato is at all concerned with the World-Soul in the Laws. It has also been very much debated whether the general account of Laws 10 is consistent with the Timaeus. This requires us to examine the status of soul and its connection with evil in Laws 10 against the background of Plato's cosmol?gica! account in earlier dialogues.

This rejection, however, does not do away with the existence of an "evil kind of soul," nor does it do away with the problem of evil in general, about which Plato seems to be worried probably more than ever, though at the same time he wishes more than ever to be convinc ing about the existence of teleology. This, as we shall see, gives the Laws a fluctuating tone between optimism and pessimism, which could nevertheless be resolved as pessimism about individual human affairs but optimism about the victory of goodness in the whole that will subsume any partial evil. I The priority of soul over body. Why does Plato need to "prove" that god exists? It is obvious that this need arises when god's exis tence is no longer evident or a matter of consensus, as it used to be (885e-886a), but has now been controverted by modern theories. It will no longer be sufficent to point to the "sun, moon, stars and earth, as instances of divinity," because many people would say "that these things are simply earth and stone" and bulks of inanimate things (886d-e, cf. 12.967c). These materialists claim the priority of body over soul (891c) and posit nature (phusis), chance (tuche), or chance by necessity (tuch? ex anank?s) (889c) as the main cause of every thing: the random motion, collision, and admixture of opposite proper ties of water, earth, fire, and air (like hot-cold, wet-dry, soft-hard) gave rise to the heavenly bodies and the universe in general (889b-c). "And all this, as they assert, not by reason (nous), god (theos) or art (techne) but... by nature and chance" (889c). It is these materialists, then, who provide the scientific support for atheism. Plato purports to attack them by conversely establishing the priority of soul over body. To phusis understood as chance and necessity, Plato opposes his own principles, namely god and design (techn?) and intellect (nous) as things akin to soul (889b-c, cf. 892a c). The latter should be prior as the first cause of generation and corruption of everything and, if by "nature" the materialists mean "the productive source associated with the first elements" (genesin ten</page><page sequence="3">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN UU/VS 10 277 peri ta pr?ta, 892c), it should be soul (psuche) and not fire or air that deserves to be first "by nature" (phusei), since soul is the first source of all things (pr?te genesis pant?n, cf. 896a).3 Against this background, we see that it is vital for Plato to estab lish a connection between god and soul, understood as purposive intelligence (cf. techn? and nous). The struggle between theism and atheism becomes then a struggle between teleology and chance (or random mechanism) as the key factor in explaining the universe.4 Proving the existence of god turns out to be equivalent to proving the priority of soul to body, and that the soul in charge of the universe is intelligent and therefore good. This then is Plato's next task. At Laws 893b Plato starts his proof of this priority of soul over body with the following steps: 1. Of all the things in the universe (ta panto), some are in motion, some are at rest. 2. It is in a place (en ch?r?i Uni) that the static things rest and the moving things move. 3. Among the things that move we can distinguish ten kinds of motion5, the last two of which are: (a) "That kind of motion 3 That is, phusis is here to be understood as natura naturans?rather than as natura naturata?being therefore a synonym of arche. Similarly, genesis should be translated as "productive source"?rather than as "produc tion," as taken by E. B. England, The Laws of Plato, vol. 2 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1921), 26; T. M. Robinson, Plato's Psychology (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1970), 147; R. G. Bury, Plato. Laws, vol. 2 (London: William Heinemann, 1968), 323. In this light it becomes more intelligible why soul should be the proper phusis of everything. Compare also with G?rard Naddaf, L'origine et r?volution du concept grec du phusis (Lewiston: Mellen, 1992), 492, 500. 4 As we shall see, the notion of teleology, or that all events are arranged toward a good end, appears thus in Plato's thought deeply connected with the notion of a designing mind, and this applies not only at the human but also at the cosmic level. For the kind of goal pursued by the designing mind see note 48. 5 For motion Plato uses kinesis and metabol?, meaning not only locomo tion but every kind of motion. The first eight may be summarized as follows: rotation, locomotion, division, mixture, increase, decrease, corruption, and generation (893c-894a). For a detailed explanation of the different kinds of motion in the Laws and a comparison with the Timaeus see J. B. Skemp, The Theory of Motion in Plato's Later Dialogues (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1942), 100-7. Let us add that the account of the ten motions in the Laws should not be taken to contradict the six rectilinear motions that characterize anank? at Timaeus 43b. For these could be included, in</page><page sequence="4">278 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE which can always move other things, but is unable to move itself" (894b). This is to be understood not as another kind at the same level as the preceding eight, but as the way in which every kind of corporeal change takes place, that is, as a mechanical series in which each member is "constantly moving something and being moved by something else" (894c).6 (b) "That motion which can always move itself and other things" by way of corporeal changes (894b). This kind turns out to be the condition of possibility of all the corporeal changes, qua their first mover. "Self-motion" (ten aut?n heaut?n kinou san [kin?sin]) thus turns out to be the principle of all motion (arche kinese?n pas?n, 895b). It is therefore the first (pr?te) not only in the logical?and metaphysical?order, but also in dignity (presbutat?) and efficacy (krauste, diapheront?s Prak tiken) (894d, 895b), whereas the motion that is moved by some thing else and in turn moves other things is secondary (dent era, 895b). Plato then proceeds to give the name of soul to this self-motion (which is literally defined as t?n dunamen?n aut?n hauten kinein kin?sin, or as to heauto kinein, 896a), and to refer secondary motions to "the motion of an inanimate body" (s?matos apsuchou metabol?) (896b). Thus soul, being self-motion, is the cause (aitia) or arche kinese?s of everything, having priority over body and ruling over it (896b-c). Soul is, in the first place, the cause of its own motions, which are states of mind such as "moods, dispositions, wishes, reasonings, true opinions, concerns, and memories" (896c-d). Consequently, it is the cause of every kind of secondary motion of the corporeal, which in turn gives rise to the sensible qualities of things (cf. 897a-b). If soul is prior to body, then, the properties of soul (ta psuch?s) will also be prior to those of the corporeal (ta tou s?matos), such as length, width, depth, and strength (896d). We might therefore infer that nous, techn?, and nomos, which at 892a-b had been settled as akin to soul, should also be prior by nature (phusei). the scheme of the Laws, as different kinds of locomotion, according to their different directions. 6 Cf. Joseph Moreau, LAme du monde de Platon aux Sto?ciens (Hildes heim: Georg Olms, 1965), 62.</page><page sequence="5">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 279 As we can see, this account so far shows many points of contact with the Timaeus. The distinction between primary and secondary motion, referred to soul and body respectively, is parallel to that between primary and secondary causes in the Timaeus (46c-e; 68e 69a). Primary motion operates by making use of secondary motions (cf. kata at Laws 894bl0 and chr?mene at Laws 897bl), and there is a similar relation between primary and secondary causation in the Timaeus (68e). Even though the Timaeus does not explicitly say that the first kind of causes (that is, souls) are self-movers, it seems to be implied by the context: secondary causes are those "which occur by other things being moved and moving other things by necessity" (46e), so we can infer that primary causes are those which move themselves. The account of soul as self-motion is also parallel to that in the Phaedrus (245c-246a).7 This definition of soul was in the Phaedrus established in close connection to the body which is moved by soul: "All body which has its motion from inside, for itself and by itself is animate, as if this was precisely the nature of soul" (245e); this in turn matches the further assertion that "all soul takes care of all the inanimate" (246b). The consequences of this definition of soul as self mover are therefore of the utmost importance. As J. B. Skemp has remarked: "The passage seems to imply a close union of psuch? and s?ma ... In spite of what seems a sheer dichotomy ... it is clear that Plato thinks of the two as conjoined in reality and implying one another."8 The same results could be applied to the Laws, since, despite Plato's efforts to distinguish soul and body in order to make the former prior, it is from the very beginning established in universal terms (cf. premise 2 above) that "whatever moves . . . moves in a place" (893c); this will apply to every kind of motion, including the tenth, which is psychic motion. This means that the motion of soul takes place in space (ch?ra, cf. Timaeus 52a-b) and, therefore, in the corporeal that fills in space (since there is no void, cf. Timaeus 58a). Soul, though invisible (898d-e, cf. Timaeus 36e, 46d), seems 7 For the apparent incompatibility between Phaedrus and Laws that would result from comparing the account of soul as arche kin?se?s and ungenerated in the Phaedrus and generated in the Laws, and the possibility of their conciliation, cf.

Soul also appears as "inhabiting" and "administering" a body (cf. 896d-e).9 II The evil soul. We have seen that Plato has so far (893b-896d) tried to prove the priority of soul over body as a priority of first motions over secondary motions, the former being the arche. Now, if soul is the principle of all change and quality, Plato concludes that soul is the cause of everything (t?n pant?n aitia), including therefore "good and bad, fair and foul, just and unjust and all the contraries" (896d). Although we have thus far been speaking o?psuch? in general, qua soul, Plato now wishes to show that whatever applies to soul in general also applies to soul or souls ruling over the universe: "Should we not say that psuch?, which administers and inhabits all things which are moved everywhere, also controls the universe (ouranos)?" (896dl0-e2). It is at this stage that we have to face a difficulty arising from the previous arguments, for (1) soul is the principle of everything, and therefore of all the contraries (including good and bad), but (2) an incautious application of (1) could lead us to violate the principle of noncontradiction, which Plato had applied to the law of causality at Republic 4.436b: "It is evident that the same thing will not admit to produce or undergo contrary effects in the same sense, with respect to the same thing and at the same time." 9 Certainly, Plato seems to leave the soul-body relation as regards the gods much more open at 898e-899a, where he allows for three possibilities, namely that the soul of the sun conducts it (1) from inside its body, as the human soul does; (2) from another body outside moving the sun's body by force, and (3) without a body but with some marvellous powers. We can suppose that the reason for leaving this question, among others, open is that to solve the very difficult problem of the soul-body relation (which he so clearly poses here) is not crucial for his argument against atheism. Cf. note 26 below. However, he seems to reject (2) in the Critias (109b-c), and to be very worried here about (3) (cf. dunameis huperbaUousas thaumati, 899a); whereas (1) seems to be supported not only by the other passages mentioned above in Laws 10, but also by the parallelism between macrocosm and microcosm established in the Philebus (29a-30a).</page><page sequence="7">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 281 How, then, can one thing such as soul be the cause of all the contraries at Laws 896d? The passage of the Republic already men tioned concluded that if we find that that happens, "we shall know that it was not one thing but more than one"; and on this basis Plato proceeded to distinguish different parts, faculties, or "kinds" (eid?, gene) within the individual soul. The principle settled in the Republic seems to be implicit in this discussion in the Laws, and an attempt to keep to it is suggested by the conclusion that it cannot be just one soul (or kind of soul) but more than one (pleious, 896e4): "Let us postulate not less than two: the b?n?ficient soul (tes euergetidos) and that which is capable of producing the opposite results (tes tanantia dunamen?s exergazesthai)" (896e5-6), afterwards called "the evil soul" (t?n kak?n, 897dl). The text goes on to say: "Soul leads all things in heaven and earth and sea by its own motions, the names of which are: wish, reflection, concern, counsel, opinion true or false, joy, grief, boldness, fear, hate, love, and whatever motions akin to these, or primary motions, take over (paralambanousai) the secondary motions of body and lead everything to increase and decrease and separation and combination, and to the things derived from these: heat and cold, heaviness and lightness, hardness and softness, whiteness and blackness, bitterness and sweetness, and all those things which soul employs, both when, having acquired divine reason it is rightly god10 and always governs things rightly and happily, and when conversely, associated with un reason (anoi?i sungenomen?) produces all the effects contrary to those" (896e8-897b4). Plato then wonders "which kind of soul (pot eron psuch?s genos), whether the one which is wise and full of excel lence or that which has neither quality, is in control of heaven, earth, and the whole revolution" (897b7-cl). Several problems result from different interpretations that might be given of this text. I shall first present them before offering my own solution. Ill Problems concerning the evil soul at Laws 896e-897b. We may first wonder whether Plato is speaking here only of soul at a cosmic 10 The first four words of 897b2 present philological difficulties. We can read, among various possibilities, either "aei theon orth?s theois" (Burnet,</page><page sequence="8">282 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE level. If so, we cannot help being struck by the way he presents it. As to the psychic motions here referred to, we find that soul cannot only have right opinions?as in the Timaeus at 37a-c?but also false ones; something that Plato does not admit of the World-Soul in the Timaeus, which seems to be essentially rational (cf. 41d, 36e4-5). Neither had Plato there spoken of hate and love, though this could be understandable as predicated of more humanized gods ruling over the cosmos?like the Olympians?who in the Republic (10.612e), according to Plato's purified version, are said to love the just and hate the unjust (cf. Laws 901a). Plato had in the Philebus already con nected the World-Soul with "Zeus" (30c-d), so there should be no wonder if he is now thinking of the power or powers ruling over the universe in similar terms.11 "Fear" and "grief?and "joy"?could be fitted into the same kind of anthropomorphic picture. The Demiurge feels joy in the Timaeus when perceiving the similarity of the copy with the model (37c). In the Politicus we read that god becomes "worried" (k?domenos) that the world might fall into dissolution and destruction (273d); and at a further passage in the Laws Plato wonders whether we can compare god with peasants who await with "fear" the usual barren periods for the production of plants (906a). There is on the other hand no need to explain states such as wish, reflection, concern, and counsel, which recurrently characterize the provident activity of the Demiurge in the Timaeus (for example, 29e-30b, 32c, 37c). Now, even though these states of mind in the Laws could be explained as anthropomorphic ways of presenting god, or the ruling soul or souls of the universe, there still remains the difficulty about "false opinions" and, what is worse, the postulation at the end of an evil soul, or a soul invaded by folly.12 Piatonis Opera, 5, which would call nous "rightly god for the gods," or "theion orth?s theos ousa" (Auguste Dies, Platon. Les Lois (7-10), [Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1956], 160). My translation follows Di?s's reading, but nothing decisive in my interpetation depends on it. 11 In fact, Plato will further on call the latter "the gods who dwell in Olympus" (Laws 904e). 12 False opinions can in fact be the cause of soul's misbehavior. As we shall see, in the Timaeus (86b) Plato had treated anoia as a disease of the soul that has two kinds, namely, madness (mania) and ignorance (amathia). We can see how the evil soul in the Laws fits both descriptions, since it is said both to lack wisdom (897b-c)?and is therefore ignorant?and to pro duce crazy effects (cf. manik?s, 897c-d). It is then clear that, as usual in Plato, evil cannot lie but in lack of knowledge (which may be due to sheer ignorance, or to disorders in the soul such as illness or madness; cf. Prota</page><page sequence="9">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 283 The latter picture seems to be so contradictory to Plato's views on the World-Soul as completely rational in the Timaeus and Philebus, that this has led some interpreters to think that Plato is not speaking of a cosmic soul at all in this passage, but just of human individual souls.13 It is certainly true that subrational or irrational affections (path?mata) like love, fear, boldness, pleasure, and pain correspond in the Timaeus to the mortal part of the human soul and result from the implantation of the immortal soul in mortal bodies (42a, 69c-d), and that false judgements have to do with the same fact (44a). In addition, anoia is at Timaeus 86b analyzed as a disease of human soul, due to physiological disturbances, and at Timaeus 92c the possi bilities of nous or anoia determine the different transformations of human being into animal or vice versa. But, if it is just the human souls that Plato is speaking of here, it is hard to understand why he says of them that only they "rule everything in heaven, earth and sea" (896e)?or, as Plato will say afterwards, are "in control of heaven and earth and the whole revolution." (897b-c). That is why many people have kept to the view that, at Laws 896e-897b, Plato is just concerned with soul at a cosmic level, which has mainly been taken to be the World-Soul. If this were so, the "evil" soul could be taken at least in three different ways, each answering to ambiguities in the text. We could in turn present them as different ways to solve the contradiction that, as we saw, would emerge if only one soul, at the same time and in the same respect, were the cause of all the contraries. We could take one of the following views: 1. We are dealing with two distinct?and coexisting?souls, the one good and the other one bad?as suggested by Laws 896e4 (plei ous). 2. It is the same soul that can be associated both with nous and with anoia (as the singular psuch? at Laws 896e8 might suggest), either (2.1) at different moments (as suggested by noun proslabousa anoi?i sungenomen? at 897b 1-4, if we take the participles not only conditionally but also temporally) or (2.2) in different respects. We goras 332a, Republic 444a-e, Timaeus 86b, Sophist 227e-228e), and it is according to this knowledge or ignorance of truth that soul sets phenomena either in orderly or disorderly motion. 13 Cf. for instance John Rist, Eros and Psyche (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964), 107.</page><page sequence="10">284 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE could thus think that there are different faculties or parts within the World-Soul?which produce contrary effects?as suggested by the term genos at 897b7.14 (1) was the view paradigmatically held by Plutarch, who thought that the Laws was postulating an "evil soul" as a soul of matter,15 this principle competing with the (good) World-Soul for the governance of the universe.16 The notion of a cosmic battle could also be sug gested by the striking passage at Laws 906a where we read of an athanatos mache perpetually taking place in the universe, though, as I shall try to argue, in this case it is clearly human beings who are the protagonists of this drama. In addition, we know that god is essentially good for Plato and that cosmic disorder in general tends to be ascribed not to the agency of god but to his absence (cf. Timaeus 53b, Politicus 273c-e). Finally, this kind of dualism is overtly rejected in the Politicus myth: "We should not say that . . . two different gods, with opposing designs, turn the universe" (269e-270a). (2.1) could conform to a "cyclical" view of Plato's universe, by which the latter exhibits alternating periods of cosmic order and disor der, as mythically presented in the Politicus.17 If this were so, the 14 The use of the term genos can here be related to the attempt in the Republic to keep to the principle of noncontradiction there stated by positing different aspects or kinds (eid?, 437d, 440e-441a; genos, 441c) within the one soul. (cf. Part 2, paragraph 2 above.). The term genos is also used in the Timaeus, as well as eidos, for the different "parts" of the soul (cf. 69c d, 89e, 90a). 15 He also compared this evil soul with Ariman in Persian dualist religion and called it "Hades"; cf. Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride 370b-d and 370f-371a. For the evil soul as a soul of matter, cf. Plutarch, De animae procreatione in Timaeo 1014d-1015f, though here, in comparison with the former text, Plutarch's account is unsurprisingly inconsistent, as has been pointed out by Harold Cherniss, Plutarch's Moralia (London: William Heineman, 1976), 13:136-40. 16 Such an atttempt to give matter a principle of its own as different from the World-Soul has often been made by scholars from the nineteenth century onwards. This view was strongly defended by Ulrich Von Wilamow itz-Moellendorff in Platon (Berlin: Weidmann, 1919), 2:321 (following Plu tarch); though more moderately by Hans Heiter in "Bewegung der Materie bei Platon," Rheinisches Museum 100 (1957), 327-47; E. R. Dodds, "Plato and the Irrational," Journal of Hellenic Studies 45 (1945) 21; and, following Dodds, W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press 1978), 5:97 n. 1. This possibility is also allowed by G. M. A. Grube, Plato's Thought (London: Athlone, 1980), 147 n. 1. 17 This cyclical view was suggested to me by Conrado Eggers Lan. Note also that we could include here the temporal?though not necessarily cycli</page><page sequence="11">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 285 Laws could be remitting to a single animic source both the orderly and disorderly cosmic motion described in the former dialogue though I have argued elsewhere against the notion of cosmic cycles as such in the Politicus.18 We could now add the inconveniences that would result from thinking that in the Laws soul can pass from "acquiring" nous and being "god" (on Di?s's reading of 897bl-2; see note 10 above) to being invaded by folly, for in that case "god" would be just an accidental property of soul which comes into being and perishes according to soul's association with nous or anoia respectively, something that con tradicts the very notion of god as immortal (904a-b, cf. Laws 12.967d) and unchangeable in its essence.19 In addition, let us stress that the concession of periods of absolute disorder?and therefore of tuche? seems incompatible with Plato's radical attempt at refuting atheism and the materialists at the very beginning of Laws 10. Now, (2.1) might be thought of as a subcase of (2.2), insofar as the possibility that soul becomes associated with nous or anoia at different times could be explained by the fact that soul has an irratio nal faculty. (2.2) could then say that the "evil soul" is a subrational faculty of the World-Soul, liable to unreasonable behaviour by which it produces undesirable effects. This possibility of "partition" in the World-Soul, analogous to human soul, might be suggested if we inter pret some of the allusions in the Laws in the light of the treatment of the partition of human soul in the Republic.20 As we have seen, at cal?view of those literalists who claim the existence of a precosmic chaos (in the Timaeus, for example) and try to look for an animate source for it. In this line, cf. R. Hackforth, "Plato's Cosmogony (Timaeus 27d ff.)," Classical Quarterly 9 (1959), 21. 18 Cf. Gabriela Roxana Carone, "Cosmic and Human Drama in Plato's Statesman," Polis 12, nos. 1 and 2 (1993), 99-121. 19 Cf. Republic 2.380c-381c. It could certainly be argued that this con clusion is valid only if nous is just a faculty immanent to soul (and if we follow Di?s's reading of Laws 897b 1-2) though not if nous is a separate entity as god (as Burnet's reading of the text might suggest). Not even this could be so, however, for if nous is separate and has no intervention in the universe when it falls into disorder?as a literal reading of Politicus 273c d could suggest?then this would contradict proposition (2) in the Laws about god essentially and always (905e, cf. 903b) taking care of the whole universe. 20 As suggested by R. Hackforth, Plato's Phaedrus (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1952), 75-6; cf. L?on Robin La th?orie platonicienne de l'amour (Paris: Alean 1908), 164. I myself defended this view as an explanation of natural disorders within the orderly cosmos in "El problema del 'alma mala' en la ?ltima filosof?a de Plat?n (Leyes 10, 893d ss.)," Revista de Filosof?a 3, no. 2 (1988), 143-63, though I now find it more problematic.</page><page sequence="12">286 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE Laws 897b where it is asked "which kind of soul is in charge of the universe?" the word genos could be translated as "faculty" or "part."21 However, if it is the World-Soul (and also the heavenly bodies, which share its same nature)22 that has different faculties and therefore is said to be the cause of good and bad, but in different respects, then we could not say of the whole of the World (-Soul) and the heavenly bodies, but only of their nous, that they are gods, since, as Plato repeatedly stresses in the Laws, gods are only the cause of good (for example, 899b, 900d). Yet Plato does say explicitly in the Laws both that the whole universe?including therefore its whole soul?is a god (Laws 7.821a;23 also cf. 10.897b on Dies' reading), and that the souls of the heavenly bodies, taken either individually or collectively, are gods (10.899a-b); which suggests that they are essentially and exclu sively rational, as in the Timaeus (given the fact that the goodness of the gods lies in their rationality, cf. Laws 900d, 897b). None of these interpretations of the evil soul seems to be convinc ing. However, I wish to show that these are not the only possible ways of resolving the problem: (1) As to the scope of "soul" at Laws 896e-897b, I will try to show that it need not refer exclusively either to cosmic soul or human soul, but Plato may be also keeping a more general sense, o?psuch? as soul qua soul. (2) As far as the ontological status of the evil soul is concerned, I will point out that the text explicitly shows that there is no evil soul in charge of the whole universe, so that in this respect the latter is just a hypothesis. This however does not dismiss the existence of a kind of evil soul as such, which will require further investigation. IV The scope of soul at Laws 896e-897b. The fact rather seems to be that, in the passage starting at 896e8, Plato has certainly fused two 21 In addition, we could interpret the athanatos mache at Laws 906a as a conflict between functions within the World-Soul, seeing that the conflict between the parts of human soul was compared in the Republic to political strife and described in these terms (cf. polemein, stasiazein, summachos at 440a-b), though, as I have said, I shall argue that this passage should be read differently. 22 As is clear from the fact that in the Timaeus they have not given rise to a new mixture. 23 Cf. ton megiston theon kai holon ton kosmon at 821a2. I take the kai as epexegetic, given that Plato is speaking here in an astronomical context</page><page sequence="13">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 287 senses in which he speaks of soul. On the one hand, he is keeping the general and abstract sense, qua soul, in which he had been speak ing before, in the passage concerning the priority of soul over body (894b-896d).24 This sense would a fortiori include any kind of psy chical motion, like false opinion, nous, or anoia. On the other hand, he is introducing psuch? as concretely referring to soul or the "kind of soul" (cf. psuch?s genos, 897b7) ruling over the universe.25 The latter can include not only the World-Soul but also the heavenly bod ies, as 898d will suggest.26 and refers to the "sun and moon" as great gods (megaton the?n) at 821b, something that suggests that the greatest god is the whole universe. 24 This view of the passage, restricted just to soul qua soul, is taken for instance by Harold Cherniss in "The Sources of Evil according to Plato," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 98 (1954), 26 n. 29; Friedrich Solmsen in Plato's Theology (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1942), 141; Moreau in L'Ame du monde, 69; Robinson, Plato's Psychology, 148-51; though I think it is only partially correct, since Plato is adding here a second sense as I will now show. On the other hand, I do not think there is any allusion to the World-Soul before 896e?as is however claimed by Claude Gaudin, "Automotricit? et auto affection: un commentaire de Platon Lois, X 894d-895c," Elenchos 11 (1990) 178, 183?nor any identification of soul with reason or mind at 893c -896e, as supposed by William Craig, The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz (London: Macmillan, 1980), 8, 13. 25 It is 896dl0-e2 that marks the fusion, since Plato there suggests that soul should be considered not only as administering all things that are moved anywhere (which I take to be soul qua soul) but also the ouranos, thus giving "soul" a more specific connotation. This reference to soul administering the ouranos would immediately suggest the World-Soul to any reader of the Timaeus, as much as the allusion to the ouranos at 896e8 does. 26 In fact, when Plato asks which "kind" of soul rules the universe (897b), and further concludes that it is good soul, "either one or many" (mian ? pleious, 898c; cf. psuch? ? psuchai, 899b), we could think at first sight that for him the question about the unity or multiplicity of souls ruling the universe is left open (as claimed by the first four authors quoted in note 24 above). And he may have reason to do so, since to decide this problem is not crucial for the point he is making in this kind of exoteric discourse, namely, that the masses should believe in god, be it one or many. However, a careful reading of the text suggests that in fact both levels of divinity?the singular and the plural?are maintained here, and that he is thinking of both the World-Soul and the heavenly bodies, as in the Timaeus (without either ex cluding the Olympians as their traditional counterparts; cf. Laws 904e). In fact, at 898d Plato will say of the sun, moon, or other stars, that psuch? periagei panta kai hekaston; in other words, that soul conducts the whole astronomical system (as a World-Soul) and each heavenly body individually, which should also have its own soul (cf. 898d on the soul of the sun). This would in turn be consistent with the question about what "kind of soul" rules over the universe, since both World-Soul and the soul of each heavenly body</page><page sequence="14">288 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE So, if we interpret that Plato is speaking both of soul in general and of soul at a cosmic level here, we need not incur either of the difficulties involved in the two partial views mentioned above, the one being that if the passage at 896e8-897b4 refers exclusively to the World-Soul, it could not speak of its being associated with anoia or having false opinion; the other being that if only human souls were meant, they could not be said to rule everything in the universe. The point rather seems to be that when Plato speaks of false opinion or the possibility of anoia, he is mentioning states of soul as such, and the question from here onwards will be to decide which states of soul, either nous or anoia, prevail in the universe as a whole.27 V The status of the evil soul at a cosmic level. At 897b-c Plato wonders: "Which of the two kinds of soul is in charge of heaven and earth and the whole revolution (poteron psuch?s genos enkrat?s ouranou kai g?s kai poses tes periodou)? The one which is wise and full of virtue (to phronimon kai aret?s pl?r?s) or the one which lacks both things?" Plato does not give a direct answer, but poses a condi tional alternative which appeals to the study of heavenly motions: If the whole course and motion of heaven and everything in it is akin to the motion, revolutions, and reckonings of reason?that is, if it is regular, in the same place, around the same point, and in the same direction (pros to auto), according to a unique proportion and order (logon kai taxin) 898a?then it is the best soul that leads and cares for the whole cosmos. If, conversely, the universe marches in a mad and disorderly way (monik?s kai atakt?s), then it is the evil soul (897c-d). To this alternative Clinias answers that it would not be pious to say anything but that it is the soul which is full of all virtue that drives the whole revolution of the universe (898c). This conclusion in fact are shown in the Timaeus to be of the same kind or nature. Thus the mian ?pleious of 898c turns out to be a mian kai pleious. Cf. Francis Cornford, Plato's Cosmology (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1956), 108; A. J. Festugi?re, "Platon et l'Orient," Revue de Philologie 21 (1947), 21. 2 It is then from 897b7 that Plato will delimit the scope of soul specifi cally to soul in charge of the universe, as we shall now see.</page><page sequence="15">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 289 supposes a second premise, namely, that the motion of the universe is orderly. Though this premise is only implicit here, it is explicitly posed as the basis of the same kind of "physico-theological proof both in the Philebus (28e, 30c) and in Laws 12.966e. In this latter text two reasons are given for our belief in the existence of the gods: first, the priority of soul over body; secondly, "the order of the motion of the stars and all the other things under the control of nous which has ordered everything."28 It is, then, astronomy in the light of its recent discoveries?which shows, for example, that planets do not "wander" but follow a single regular track (cf. Laws 7.821a-822c)? and not superficial and commonsense arguments, which comes to support the belief in gods ordering the universe.29 This is how Plato can then reassert in Lows 10 that it is one or several souls that are good in respect of every excellence and therefore theoi, which conduct all the stars and cause years, months, and seasons (899b). With this Plato concludes his demonstration of proposition (1) concerning the existence of the gods after having shown, first, the priority of soul over body, and secondly, that the kind of soul in charge of the universe is absolutely good. From this perspective, what has the status of the "evil soul" proved to be so far? It is clear from the argument at 896d-898c that an evil cosmic kind of soul was just a mere hypothesis, which Plato posed as an alternative to the good soul at the beginning, but only to reject it. However, we should not think, with some interpreters,30 that with this the case of the evil soul is absolutely closed, for the argument does not dismiss the existence of "evil soul" as such. What the conclu sion clearly shows is that it is not an evil soul (but an excellent kind of soul) that rules over the universe, taken as the whole astronomical system (cf. ouranou periphora, 898c3). In this respect, the crazy and 28 It is, as we have seen before, a recurrent principle of Plato's thought that order is due to nous (nous diakosm?n pauta, Phaedo 97c.) Cf. Cratylus 400a, Philebus 28e, Laws 12.967b. For god as ordering cf. Phaedrus 246e, Politicus 273d-e, Laws 12.899b.

Clearly not, for Plato recurrently goes on speaking of the existence of evil in the universe even after he has proved the existence of the gods (903d 906c). If we keep to the principle according to which an evil kind of soul is the cause of bad effects in the universe, we should admit that there exists an evil kind of soul. This kind of soul will certainly not rule over the whole astronomical system?as the argument has just shown. That is why in that respect "false opinions" or soul's associa tion with anoia were also hypothetical. However, these become ac tual states of soul when we come to explain the existence of evil that is still present?especially at the sublunar level?within an orderly universe ruled by god.32 What is the status of this actual evil kind of soul? VI Human souls as responsible for partial evil. Plato seems to give an answer to this question in the section that follows the demonstra tion of the existence of the gods, where he now purports to prove that they care for human affairs and cannot be bribed (899d-907b). In fact, we find there that the only kind of concrete evil souls which Plato speaks about in Laws 10 are human souls (903d-904c). In addition, he says that whereas excellence lies in moderation, nous, and courage, evil (kakia) lies in their opposites, namely, folly (aphro sune), unreason (anoia), and cowardice; and he adds that "whatever is bad (phlaura), if anything, corresponds to us (pros?kei h?min)" (900d-e). Therefore we should think that soul associated with anoia at 897b, if it is present in the universe at all, corresponds to human soul (cf. 906a-c), of which however Plato also says?though to a lesser degree?that it has a share in the government of the universe, 31 Similarly, I have interpreted a-cosmic disorder as a hypothesis in the Timaeus (cf. 53b) and Politicus (273c-e). Cf. my publications referred to above in notes 7 and 18 respectively. 32 Here we can make use of the ambiguity of the participle in the phrase anoi?i sungenomen? at 897b3, which can be read both conditionally and temporally.</page><page sequence="17">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 291 as is claimed for "soul" at 896e8. In fact, we have seen that it is mainly the gods who are in charge of this government, but we also read further on at 903b -c that "the one who cares for the universe has arranged everything towards the preservation and excellence of the whole," the parts of which also have rulers (archontes) in charge of achieving that end even in the smallest fraction. Amongst these rulers we can certainly read an allusion to lesser gods accompanying the main divinity (cf. Politicus 271d, 272e, Timaeus 41a-d, 42d-e, Philebus 30d; and which in Plato's own cosmic religion could be the heavenly bodies ruled in turn by the World-Soul); but Plato clearly adds that "one of these portions [which have archontes] is also yours, and, however small, tends towards the whole and always looks to it" (903b-c). Thus human beings too are archontes of the small portions (moria) that are allotted to them in the universe, since they have responsibility (aitia) for the changes, whether good or evil, that they provoke (cf. 904c-d).33 Their souls could therefore be implicitly in cluded in the scope of "soul" conducting the universe at 896e8, and only the government of their small portions?for example, whole cities, families, or just our own lives?could turn out to be bad.34 I have said that Plato speaks only of human soul as a source of evil. He in fact tries to show how god has arranged everything so that goodness might prevail and evil be defeated in the whole (nik?san t?n aret?n, h?tt?men?n de kakian, 904b). It is clear in this context, however, that Plato is speaking of human affairs (anthr?pina prag mata 902b) or souls conjoined now with one body, now with another, which can be better or worse and, accordingly, achieve a better or worse destiny (903d). It is whatever is bad in our soul that tends to harm (blaptein). It is we who have the responsibility (aitia) for good or bad behavior according to our will (boul?sis), though the conse quences of this behavior are established "according to the order and law of destiny" (kata t?n tes heimarmen?s taxin kai nomon, 904b c), these laws having in turn been established by the gods (904e, cf. Timaeus 41e). This passage can be taken as a clue to distinguishing 33 Let us remember, in the light of Laws 896b-c, that the notion of soul's being an arche in the sense of aitia is inseparable from that of archein as ruling. The pleious of 896e4 would thus refer to 896dl0-e2 as a conjunction. Although only one kind of soul (the good one) administers the heaven, human souls, including bad ones, are responsible for administering their part of hapanta ta pant?i kinoumena.</page><page sequence="18">292 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE two levels of ethical teleology, which we may call human and cosmic. The former, as we shall see, depends for its fulfillment on the right use of our freedom, this being a task for us to achieve; whereas the latter is the given framework of cosmic justice for any kind of action. This system of cosmic justice, based on the principle of like to like, guarantees that "if you become worse, you go to the company of worse souls, and, if yon become better, you go to the company of the better souls," so that "both in fife and in every death you do and suffer what it is proper that like should do toward like" (904e).35 In this respect, it is very interesting to see how, even though the allusion to god's concern for human affairs suggests his personal intervention, the actual achievement of cosmic justice is in fact much easier (cf. 903e-904a) and, so to speak, "automatic."36 As Paul Fried laender and E. R. Dodds have remarked, at Laws 904c-e reward and punishment are not so much parts of a myth as special cases of a universal law, namely, that like should go with like. The law of cosmic justice turns out to be a law of spiritual gravity, for every soul both in life and after death gravitates naturally towards the company of its own kind, and therein lies its punishment or reward. This means giving a cosmic background to Plato's former eschatological views and to his belief that the punishment for the wicked is having to live with the wicked (Laws 5.728b), or that wrong-doing is its own worst punish ment (as we could infer from Laws 10.899e, 905b-c).37 In this respect, god (mainly, the World-Soul) controls as a "draughts-player" (903d) the consequences of actions which have their aitia in our own soul.38 35 Emphasis added. That the consequences of these conditional decrees for the destiny of human souls apply in life clearly shows that ethics for Plato does not necessarily depend on eschatology?though it does not exclude it either. For the same suggestion cf. Apology 30c-d, Gorgias 470e, 478d, 527b-e, and Republic 10.621c-d. 36 On this point cf. T. J. S?unders, "Penology and Eschatology in Plato's Timaeus and Laws," The Classical Quarterly 23, no. 2 (1973), 234, 237. 37 Cf. Paul Friedlaender, Plato, trans. Hans Meyerhoff (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969), 3:438, E. R. Dodds The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), 221 (Dodds also quotes Plotinus [Enneads 4.3.24] as a development of this idea of cosmic justice; cf. 233 n. 76). 38 As we said above, there are several personal allusions to god in this section of the Laws (899d-907b). For example, we are reminded of the Demiurge when god is compared to those artisans who, the better they are, the more perfectly they realize both small and large things (902e), making the part for the sake of the whole and not vice versa (903c). God is also compared to a pilot (905e), as in the Politicus (272e). In addition, the god</page><page sequence="19">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 293 This emphasis on human responsibility is worth noting. In the preceding section (893b-899d) Plato had spoken of soul as the aitia of everything, both good and bad, and proved that it is only the gods that are the cause of the goodness or order in the universe as a whole. We may call this an argument for natural teleology based on the regularity of the astronomical system, which is a given fact. Futher more, when Plato discusses evil in the section beginning at 899d, the notion of aitia is again remitted to soul when dealing with evil, specifically in the sense of moral responsibility (cf. 904b-d). Here more than ever Plato shows that in the ethical domain it is a task for us to give to our lives a teleological orientation, and contribute to wards the goodness of the whole. We are encouraged to learn that whatever is good for the whole is also best for us by virtue of our common origin (903d). Thus teleology is shown to be present at every level, and soul is the agent responsible for its fulfilment. On the one hand, the soul of the god or gods at the natural level, and also at the ethical level with respect to cosmic justice, secures the teleological arrangement of the whole as something given; on the other, human souls at the ethical level are responsible for the task of giving a teleo logical orientation to the actions stemming from their (free) will. Plato's tone becomes quite dramatic at 906a-b, a passage that is most important in illuminating the problem of evil and its cosmic implications in Laws 10: Since we have agreed among ourselves that the universe (ouranos) is full of many good things, but also of their opposites, and that those which are not good are more numerous (pleion?n de t?n me), such a battle, we say, is immortal (mache . . . athanatos) and requires an extraordinary vigilance, the gods and daemons being our allies (summa choi), and we in turn the possession of gods and daemons. And what corrupts us is injustice and arrogance (hubris) together with folly; and what preserves us is justice and moderation together with wisdom; and or gods who establish the conditional decrees of destiny are indifferently referred to in the plural as theoi hoi Olumpon echousin, giving them a traditional face (904e), or in the singular, as our "king" (904a) or as "the one who cares for the whole" (903b), or even as the "draughts-player" (903d). Despite all these "personal" allusions, however, it is in any case clear that this god who takes care of the universe cannot be other than the god, that is, the good soul (World-Soul or the soul of the heavenly bodies), whose existence and governance has been previously proven. In addition, having seen how "automatically" cosmic justice works, we can suppose that this (World) Soul in fact operates much more impersonally than the personal allusions suggest.</page><page sequence="20">294 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE these reside in the animate powers of the gods, though one can see clearly a small vestige also dwelling here in us. Although the allusion to an immortal battle between good and evil taking place in the universe could again make us think of an evil cosmic soul, this possibility is immediately dismissed as soon as we realize that we are the protagonists of this battle, the gods and dae mons being just our summachoi and only on the side of the good. Folly, injustice, and arrogance are again left on our side. Plato's pessimism about the existence of more evils than goods in the universe is certainly astonishing, particularly within a kind of discourse which is devoted to emphasizing the existence and triumph of teleology. But we should notice here how Plato has come to see the ouranos more and more as the stage of human life, and it can only be as regards the latter that he says that there are more evils than goods (as he had explicitly affirmed at Republic 2.379c).39 This pessimism?or rather, realism?is however only partial, for Plato has already shown above, again in martial terms, that god has arranged everything so that "goodness might win and evil be defeated in the whole" (904b).40 We have said that Plato speaks only of human souls as the source of evil. This, however, does not mean that the only kind of evil he speaks about is human, for he also speaks about natural evil in the terrestrial domain. Continuing on we read at 906c that "the vice 39 Certainly, one could also read Plato's statement about the existence of more evils than goods in the universe as just making a point about the numerousness of evils. Evil human souls or their effects may be much greater in number than the good souls?including those of the gods?in the universe (after all, we find more multiplicity at the earthly domain than in heaven), but this need not dismiss the fact that the latter have predominance, since "more evils" does not imply "more evil." For the numerous individual evils may each be small compared with the much fewer but much greater goods. However, it is interesting that Plato does not mention here the pre dominance of good. Rather, he stresses that between the forces of good and evil there is an immortal battle which is human-centered. 40 As we said above, cosmic justice is one level of ethical teleology, and could be seen as a consolation for the just man who cannot stop the existence of evil in the universe (cf. 899e, 905b-c). This, however, should not lead us to inertia; on the contrary, it should stimulate us to fight better on the side of the gods, since knowledge of cosmic justice?as an aspect of cosmic teleology?could not but make us act virtuously and therefore fight for the good (in accordance with 885b). But even if we do not succeed, we have at least the consolation that we have done our best and that teleology after all prevails from the perspective of the whole.</page><page sequence="21">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 295 (hamart?ma) now mentioned, namely excess (pleonexian), is what is called illness in bodies of flesh, pestilence in seasons and years, and injustice ... in cities and states." What then is the cause of "pestilence in seasons and years and illness in bodies of flesh"? This question about natural disorder could be answered by saying that it is an incidental random result of corporeal motions imparted by the purposive action of soul (mainly the World-Soul).41 However, here in the Laws the stress seems to be different. Plato does not focus on any cosmic source of disorder in Laws 10, probably because he wants conversely to stress the pervasive presence and concern of the gods against atheism. So, we could explain Plato's silence about any cause of natural evil other than human by the kind of exoteric and protreptic discourse we are dealing with here,42 which is meant to exalt the existence and providence of 41 This explanation could be given in the light of Timaeus 57d-58c, and has actually been attempted with respect to the Laws by Harold Cherniss in Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy (New York: Russell and Russell, 1962), 444-5; Cherniss, "The Sources of Evil," 28-9, n. 44 (where also Politicus 273b-d is brought in in support of this view); followed by Luc Brisson, Le M?me et l'Autre dans la structure ontologique du Tim?e de Platon (Paris: Klincksieck, 1974), 503-4. (For different explanations cf. Gregory Vlastos "The Disorderly Motion in the Timaeus," in Studies in Plato's Metaphysics, ?d. R. E. Allen, [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul 1965], 394-8; and, in his line, Robinson, Plato's Psychology, 95-7; H. J. Easterling "Causation in Timaeus and Laws X," Erarios 65 [1967] 31, 37-8; Richard Mohr, The Platonic Cosmology [Leiden: Brill, 1985], 159-70, 184-8.) Even though it seems to me the most adequate explanation of the existence of a residuum of chance or necessity in Nature?as suggested in Timaeus (46c7 dl, 48a) and Politicus (273b-c)?I find it more problematic as regards the Laws. For, strictly speaking, we should keep to the suggestion that whatever is bad is due to a bad kind of soul (896e, 897d). But, if there are natural disorders or evils in Nature, and if their ultimate source of motion is soul, then the (World)Soul should be evil at least in that respect (for it is the ultimate "cause" and hence "responsible") and so, it or the universe could not be said to be god as in Laws 7.821a. (cf. 10.897b if reading theos ousa). This explanation of natural evil could perhaps be saved if we qualify Plato's assertion at 896e by distinguishing between causation of evil and moral re sponsibility for it. Though Plato does not seem to do so in Laws 10 (for reasons that we shall see shortly), he does suggest so at Laws 9.863e-864a: If, when an action is performed, the opinion for the best prevails, even if some harm is done the action performed can be said to be just. In the light of this we could distinguish between a soul which is just but "capable of producing contrary effects" to the good ones (896e), and an "evil soul" as such (cf. 897d), though Plato does seem to identify them in Laws 10. On this feature of Laws 10 cf. Vlastos, "The Disorderly Motion," 392-3.</page><page sequence="22">296 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE the gods?to an extent that may present them as rather more powerful than in the Timaeus?43 and to make people aware that the goodness of the gods is such that only humans seem to be responsible for evil.44 For Plato had already asserted that whatever is bad corresponds to us (900e). According to this, we should also have moral responsibil ity for what seems to be natural evil, and this would accord with the allusions to illness and pestilence as examples of hamart?ma or pleonexia at 906c, both words having a strong anthropological and moral implication, which is in addition given here a cosmic import. If this is so, Plato would then be stressing in the Laws, with overt ecological resonances, the cosmic implications of human behavior. Human disorder is thus seen to be a pleonexia or cosmic disturbance insofar as it trespasses the limits of the portion (meros, morion, mer ismon) established for each thing (cf. 903b-c, 906a-c).45 The uni verse, in turn, has become more and more centered on the importance of human life as a part of the whole ouranos. In this regard there are some interesting conclusions to draw. 43 It is in fact noteworthy that whereas the Timaeus pointed out that nous guides (only) the majority of things (tapleista) towards the best (48a), here Plato says that god has arranged everything (panta) for the excellence of the whole (903b) and emphasizes that it is easier for god, as for any demiurge, to care for the small parts than the large ones (902c-903a), thus suggesting that there is virtually nothing that is beyond his control. This has led scholars such as Mohr to believe that in contrast with the Timaeus, Plato's god in the Laws is omnipotent; see Mohr, The Platonic Cosmology, 185. This might in fact be suggested by 901d ("the gods are capable of doing everything which is in the power of mortals and immortals"); though perhaps we are dealing here with a difference of stress rather than with a difference of thought. In fact, we must not forget the qualification at 901d that god does nothing which is beyond the power of immortals. This phrase itself does not suggest omnipotence, for the power of immortals might be limited in some ways, as seems to be the case at Laws 7.818b. Neither must we forget some other occasional qualifications on god's power such as eis dunamin at 903b. 44 The problem of evil in general in Plato's philosophy seems to be in fact one of the most difficult ones. Cherniss has rightly pointed out that it is shown to have not one, but many sources throughout the dialogues. (See Cherniss, "The Sources of Evil," and Brisson, Le M?me et l'Autre, 449-52.) Thus, Cherniss distinguishes between negative evil (due purely to the inevita ble imperfection of the sensible world as a mere reflection of the Ideas), incidental evil (as the indirect result of the purposive action of soul; this is how he tries to explain natural evil; cf. note 41 above), and positive evil, produced directly by morally responsible evil souls. However, we should again note here that, at least as far as Laws 10 is concerned, the only explicit source of evil given is the last one. 45 Cf. Friedlaender, Plato, 3:439.</page><page sequence="23">TELEOLOGY AND EVIL IN LAWS 10 297 Joseph Moreau has proposed that in contrast with the Timaeus, Laws 10 lacks the idea of an organized whole (holon), for it deals only with ta panta (895a, cf. 896d-e).46 This suggestive idea, however, could apply at the very most to the first section of Laws 10,47 which deals with the universe in general terms before introducing the role played by human beings in it (as happens from Laws 899d onward). However, it is most remarkable that we do get the desired notion of the universe as a unified whole as soon as human beings are intro duced into the description. Thus we are said to be the possession of the gods, to whom also ton ouranon holon belongs (902b). In an eschatological context we read that the one who cares for the whole (ton pantos) has arranged everything toward the preservation and excellence of the whole (ton holou, 903b). The happiness of the life (bios) of the universe as to pan is the aim (hou heneka) of every partial generation (903b-904a), this indicating more than ever an or ganic whole. What matters is to secure the victory of goodness and the defeat of evil in the whole (en t?i panti, 904b).48 And we have just seen the ouranos as the battlefield of human good and evil (906a). All these things suggest that Plato does not seem to think of the universe as a complete whole unless we include human affairs as a central part of it.49 46 Cf. Moreau, L'Ame du monde, 67. 47 In fact, even here there are references to the ouranos or kosmos, though Moreau is right to say that to holon does not appear in this context. 48 This immanent goodness of the whole is thus the goal aimed at by soul as the agent of teleology (cf. 903d, 12.967a). This is not very different from the aim to which the Demiurge tends in the Tima us, namely, "that everything should be good, and nothing bad as far as possible" (30a), that is, that the universe should be as similar to the model (the teleion auto z?on) as possible (39d-e). In the Timaeus, however, the notion of a unified organic whole was given its Ideal counterpart by positing the auto z?on, which is teleion (30c-d), as the model that guides the Demiurgic activity to produce just one visible world as a zoon (32d-33a). Though Laws 10 does not seem to make any explicit allusion to the Ideas, it very much stresses the notion of an immanent good of the whole that does not exclude any further meta physical foundation. We can again guess why Plato has not spoken of the Ideas in Laws 10, for the citizens are not required to have this accurate kind of knowledge?as the guardians will conversely be required to possess it in Laws 12.965b-966b?to live justly. Despite these differences between eso teric and exoteric tone, however, we can discover both in the Tima us and in Laws 10 the same effort to assert teleology by virtue of an intelli gent cause. 49 This does not mean that Plato does not conceive of the universe qua astronomical system as a unity (for he does at Laws 7.821a, for instance).</page><page sequence="24">298 GABRIELA ROXANA CARONE In the light of this, it is now not so surprising that Plato says that there are more evils than goods in the ouranos, or that we are archontes in it. Neither should we be surprised at the importance of our cooperation with god for the fulfillment of teleology. For his conception of the universe or kosmos has proved to have an anthropo logical tone; and what Plato is showing to us in Laws 10 is that, in the end, cosmology has significance as the framework and stage of human life. So whatever we do is reflected in the cosmos and affects it and in turn triggers its alloted cosmic consequences so that every thing can be subsumed in a teleological design, which gives the conso lation that in the end goodness triumphs from the perspective of the whole. From this standpoint, the purpose of doing cosmology or understanding the cosmos is to understand better our place in the cosmos. This is also the point, if any justification is needed, of our investigating Plato on cosmology.50 University of Buenos Aires and King's College, University of London But it does show that Plato is emphasizing here that the human world must form part of any complete account of the World. * I would like to thank Richard Sorabji and Luc Brisson for their illumi nating comments, as well as the members of Richard Sorabji's seminar in ancient philosophy at King's College, University of London, to whom an earlier version of this paper was presented.</page></plain_text>
