<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCIEN RUDRAUF Perfection* A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Keats Zum Erstaunen bin ich da. Goethe PERFECTION BELONGS to a world other than ours: I have been told this since childhood as a safeguard against illusory desires and chimerical hopes; and without a doubt, paternal wisdom was justified in pointing out imperfections in the order of human things, whether physiological, social, or moral. But very soon, to the extent that my wondering eyes opened on reality, I discovered a thousand perfections, each more admirable than the other, and I learned to say: "That is beautiful," long be- fore I learned that I was formulating judg- ments of aesthetic value and that day after day I was entering into a prodigious world of forms where perfection reigns supreme in spite of internal or external flaws which are always accidental by nature. The world of form is indeed ruled by a law of perfection, by the very principle of formative creation which is victorious over chaos. The child is enraptured by the beauty of flowers, butterflies, and shells, and proceeds gradually, if he is well gifted with sensitive and intellectual faculties, toward a knowledge of the formal world which is more and more tasteful and correct. The road to be travelled is long. In fact, there are immense regions to be explored whose limits no one can hope to reach without leaving our earthly confines. More- over, two worlds are superimposed on each other: that of natural forms, and that of art forms. Now a preliminary question appears. *Translated by G. Schueller and J. Toy. Do these two worlds stem from the same aesthetic laws? That they do has been de- nied. Charles Lalo considered the forms of nature as "an-aesthetic," as not soliciting aes- thetic appreciation, and as not submitting to the categories which rule art forms. With the best will in the world, I have not to this day succeeded in grasping the depth of his thought, which is probably of a religious nature. That of Etienne Souriau is clearer to me when, not without good reason, he holds that aesthetics is essentially a science of forms-of all forms, natural or artistic. It goes without saying that this, to my mind very rational, viewpoint is incompatible with an aesthetic which actually makes great ravages on the brain and which wants forms of art to be perfectly autonomous and devoid of standards held in common with the world of natural forms. The two laws are not superimposed; nor do they overlap. They are entirely separate and do not submit to rules which are reducible to any common legislation. Some adventurous minds push this autonomous claim to a kingdom of art still further and well beyond the limits of my feeble understanding: They proclaim that every work of art is a unique object, supremely original, amenable to its own law which is born at the same time as itself in the course of creative evolution. It comes from nothingness completely con- stituted, completely armed and triumphant, unimpeachable, set apart from all exterior laws, whether intellectual or moral. This bewildering concept, unintelligible to common sense, is assuredly in the logic of the "heterogeneous times" dear to Bergson.</page><page sequence="2">124 LUCIEN RUDRAUF It is clear that it puts beyond the pale all science of forms and renders useless the idea of perfection, which agrees necessarily with a system of references defined in advance. It is valid, in the eyes of those who believe in it, in both a figurative and a non-figurative sense. A picture vainly representing trees, flowers, animals, men, buildings, pieces of furniture, kitchen utensils; it has necessarily lost all agreement with exterior reality, be- ing uniquely and essentially painting, pure painting, Nurmalerei, as the Germans say, who can legitimately claim a respectable role, in the quantitative sense, in the diffusing of this audacious doctrine-auda- cious and proud, because it pretends to show that human genius is generated only by its own law. It does not imitate; being of a divine essence, it creates a nihilo. But, alas, this doctrine does not help us take one step forward in the true knowledge of things. Approaching the matter discreetly and in a down-to-earth manner will lead us a little further. M. Charles Lalo had a beautiful white cat. One day when I was visiting him, I admired the grace of her poses and move- ments and the perfection of her muscular structure. "You speak of her," the maestro said to me with an indulgent and gently ironic smile, "as you would of a work of art which would presuppose the hand of an artist"-a presupposition tainted in his eyes with anthropomorphism. A cat is not a work of art, I grant, any more than is a dog, a horse, a gull, a beetle, or any form of animal, vegetable, or crystal. I am willing to admit by hypothesis that all of these belong to the realm of "an-aesthetic" forms. But how can one not be struck with admiration before so many wonders, when the least attention shows us astonishing, stupifying perfections which multiply staggeringly under our eyes to the extent that we study them systematically? We admire; but we are excused from applauding since there is no artist and no work of art. These perfec- tions are "natural," "existential," as one likes to say in our time, in order to please Sartre. They have no aesthetic aim. They are by nature purely physical, chemical, or physiological. In the realm of living forms, they are truly a vital necessity, for the very life of a living being is compromised as soon as organic perfections are disturbed by ac- cident or illness. It is true that living organ- isms victoriously support enormous internal and external lesions. This is a proof of more of their essential perfection, independent of aesthetic perfection, the latter being pure form, completely superficial and, from a practical standpoint, negligible. The pro- found structures of living organisms are prodigiously complex. In the molecular or cellular scale, their complexity is such that it might seem to us exposed to perpetual risks of derangement or disaggregation, or at least submitted to a functional control at every moment or, as it were, endowed with an absolutely infallible automatism, truly marvellous and admirable. It is in the cellu- lar scale that perfection is a vital necessity. In truth derangements do occur and somatic life is put in danger. In view of the enor- mous number of cells of which the superior living organisms are composed, these de- rangements are extremely rare. Are they spontaneous or provoked? Both hypotheses must be examined by men of science with- out prejudice. If they are spontaneous, one must give up the idea of total perfection and renounce the hope of a definitive victory over the cancer (cellular derangement). If they are provoked by exterior agents, the divine perfection of living organisms is be- yond discussion. At our present stage of in- tercellular knowledge the most urgent con- cern of medical science will be in every way to reestablish order where it has been dis- turbed. I apologize for intruding into a domain where aesthetic speculations seem in vain. I have done so in order to arrive at the question of knowing if formal beauty (that which immediately strikes the senses, and about which certain minds make so much) is of a vital interest for animal and vegetable species which have developed, one does not yet know how, on our earthly globe. It does not appear that the perfection of visible organs, their harmonious propor- tions, their thriving appearance, that which Ruskin called "vital beauty," can be indis- pensable to the normal functioning of vital organs (heart, stomach, lungs). A face dis- figured by disease or accident, or a</page><page sequence="3">Perfection 125 naturally ugly one, is compatible with the most vigorous health, and the same is true of limbs badly disproportioned or ampu- tated. A cripple and even a hunchback can be gifted with a remarkable potential of vital energy. On the one hand, attractive appearances are often deceiving and do not guarantee functional perfection. On the other hand, the latter does not necessarily command harmony and vital beauty in the Ruskinian sense of visible organs. Does not nature, however, produce animal and veg- etable forms, perfectly constructed and adapted to their surroundings, which are displeasing to the sight, not aesthetically indifferent, but anti-aesthetic, such as fish with frightful mouths, birds with dispro- portioned beaks, woodlice of repugnant as- pect, cockroaches which give one goose flesh, not to mention slimy mollusks which crawl in the fluvia under sea mire? Is not creative or evolutionary nature totally indifferent to beauty? It seems in any case that what we call functionalism in art and in industry has no aesthetic efficacy in the productions of Nature, this source of life, strangely and diversely prolific, having peopled the uni- verse with innumerable species, many of which astonish us and often frighten us by their strange forms. There is a whole world of living creatures and also of inanimate objects which Victor Hugo calls "difforme." This notion would be interesting to define precisely, to define in connection with the imaginary world of the poet; being always in deep and intimate communication with the real world, I feel it my duty to point this out to the "autonomists" of human nature. The creature "difforme" is not the unformed. It has distinctive structures re- turning to definable and classifiable types and, by this fact, stemming from aesthetic judgment. Hugo calls the spider, the octo- pus, and other submarine monsters "dif- formes"; in reality, they are not monsters but living creatures perfectly constructed and perfectly adapted to their surroundings and their way of life. Quasimodo is a true monster by reason of the deformation of the nature of a normal human type. His de- formity is monstrous, the same as that of The Man Who Laughs, but the latter's de- formity is the effect of a deliberate and criminal disfiguration. A monstrously "dif- forme" creature releases aesthetic uneasi- ness, a feeling of painful ugliness, intoler- able to the hypersensibility of morbidly delicate spirits. And in the meantime Hugo does not exclude it from his poetic universe. One knows that in his literary doctrine it constitutes an essential element, indispensa- ble, according to him, to the perfection of art. In the sphere of the plastic arts, as in that of literary art, the "grotesque" and the caricatural have assuredly given birth to admirable works of art. Whoever says "work of art" says "perfec- tion." Would perfection even belong to this world? By this I mean aesthetic perfection in art and in nature. If it does, by what criterion can we recognize it? The con- formity of an object with an eternal arche- type, as the mystic Platonist would have it. But the archetype is only a mental construc- tion a posteriori, though its existence be postulated antecedent to all concrete reality. It is an article of faith, placed beyond pal- pable knowledge. How could it serve as a model for created objects and as a standard of aesthetic judgment? Nevertheless, we con- sciously or unconsciously refer to it every time we are struck with admiration in the presence of an object or beauty. Thus a little five-year-old girl, Therese, (which is her given name), who saw a marvellous but- terfly asked her grandfather (whose name is unimportant), "How was it made?" And he answered, "God made it." "Oh, I know that, Grandpa, but there must have been a model"-an archetype, she will say when she has graduated from the lycee. Appar- ently this idea of an archetype is an ancient notion (innate) of which it would be impos- sible to rid oneself. I often try to rid myself of it, but I am always resubjected to it by the irresistible beauties of this world-which, I realize, overpower only naive people such as our Alsatian housekeeper, who, seeing a "marvellous" cactus, cried out, "D'Natur isch doch a Kunschd" (literally, Nature is an art in spite of everything). This cry of a dazzled heart, which it would be useless to translate into philosophical terms, reminds me of the wonderful cat of Charles Lalo, which gave me the effect of a work of art made by a certain demiurge gifted with an</page><page sequence="4">126 LUCIEN RUDRAUF infallible sense of grace and elegance. I am entirely ignorant of the nature of demiurges and their processes of creation. Perhaps each demiurge is a specialist in one species: cattle, dogs, cats, in the situation which concerns us, and other classes, families, genres, and species of the animal and vegetable king- dom, whether known or unknown, existing or contemplated-unless as universal gen- iuses, they are capable of everything. The hypothesis of a unique creator, supremely intelligent and all-powerful, would not be passed over by philosophers and men of science. It plunges us into the middle of anthropomorphism and, by this fact, is more accessible than anything else to our human understanding. However that may be, one fact is certain: it will leave us on this side of the bounds of the knowable. No means is given us to force open the doors of the un- knowable behind which will remain eter- nally hidden the mystery of creation, nat- ural or divine-two words for the same thing. Furthermore, that is not our problem. When we see a beautiful object, whether natural or artificial, we experience a joy, if we are at all gifted with aesthetic sensibility, which is perhaps not the case for all of us- but, I am convinced, for most of us-a strange ravishment mixed with admiration, which is translated necessarily by a value- judgment: "This is beautiful," "this is per- fect," "graceful," "harmonious," "sublime." This grace, this harmony, this perfection captivates us, but instead of putting our judicial, reasonable, analytical faculties out of commission, quite, to the contrary, stimu- lates them and singularly sharpens them. It leaves us in the sphere of the knowable, of the explicable, and there opens to us vast perspectives: not infinite perspectives, but, for practical purposes, limitless ones, the brevity of our earthly existence being given. Aesthetic perfection is concerned essen- tially with formal structures: spacio-metric or chrono-metric, visual or auditory. As we have said, it stems from a knowledge both sensitive and rational. Through it we have an experience immediate, enthusiastic, and at first irrational, which gives rise to pas- sionate discussions, indeed to trenchant dis- putes. But people will object that aesthetic perfection is no more of this world than is moral or social perfection. The archetype alone is perfect. When it is embodied in earthly conditions it loses something of ideal beauty. You have let yourself be dazzled by Charles Lalo's cat. In examining it more closely, you would discover therein many imperfections of detail. And so it is with all concrete objects produced by nature or art. The argument is worth examining. To begin with, I retort that thousands and thousands of perfections escape our notice every day because we do not pay attention to them or because we look at them only superficially. You are reading under your lamp. A tiny moth or gnat falls on your page. If, instead of brutally crushing it, or stupidly chasing it, you take time to look at it carefully, you will discover a great marvel, a stunning perfection, in which a magnify- ing glass would not reveal any flaw, but would reveal to you new perfections in the whole and in detail. Daily and hourly you can provide such wonders for yourself at the cost of a little attentive effort. One spring day I was looking at a clump of begonias in the modest garden of my Alsatian house. The begonia is a really fantastic flower, one must admit, because it rather capriciously sets its archetype at defiance. I noticed one because of its exceptional dimensions which made it lean towards the ground. I lifted it to see it better and it broke off in my hand. This was one of the great moments of my stay in an earthly paradise so fright- fully shaken and troubled by sinister catas- trophes. What choked me at first with ad- miration was the dazzling "vital beauty," the sensual fullness of this exceptionally healthy flower. I laid it in a plate filled with the proper amount of water, and it lived thus for several days, displaying its en- chanting "formal beauty." Perfection, per- fection. I tried in vain to scrutinize its structure and its texture with the most sustained attention; I could not find the tiniest flaw in it as long as its bloom lasted, much more than "'espace d'un matin." It gave me a large share of contemplative blessedness, and I abandoned myself to it without scruple, finding therein the observ- ance of a sort of duty, aesthetic enjoyment being a deeply serious thing, whatever one</page><page sequence="5">Perfection 127 may pretend. This begonia was of a regu- larity unusual for that species. In the veg- etable kingdom perfection of organic struc- ture is not a vital necessity as it is in the animal kingdom, where survival is condi- tioned by an aptitude for changing location through crawling, walking, running, leap- ing, climbing, flying, swimming. The sup- pleness of deer, their agility, constitutes for them a functional beauty without an aes- thetic purpose. The beauty of flowers is use- less, pure luxury, entirely gratuitous. Is not this beauty also conditioned by a biological function, that of reproduction? Does not its radiant beauty serve to attract the bumble- bee or the honey bee, whose intervention is necessary for the work of fertilization? There would therefore be, as with animals, a functionalism not aesthetic but practical. But the bee makes its honey just as well in the fir trees whose organs of reproduction do not attract the sight in so aggressive a manner. It seems that although the beauty of roses is completely gratuitous, it still happens that their floral opulence develops to the detriment of their reproductive func- tion. In my begonia, pistils and stamens were totally reabsorbed by the exuberance of the corrolla. Thus everything happens as if an aesthetic finality presided over the marvellous blossoming season whose spec- tacle of beauty is offered us each spring, summer, and autumn. Everyone, I believe, with rare exception, loves and admires the beauty of flowers. I know only one person who does not love them, and this is a woman. (By an odd co- incidence, her given name is Rose.) Is not Nature itself indifferent? Its own purpose, if it has one, is perhaps above all the glut- ting of carnal appetites, the freeing of the will of power. Let us not be entangled by this aspect, although it takes us back by a detour to fundamental aesthetic problems under their psychological, moral, and social aspects, of which we do not lose sight. At present I am holding to the idea of formal perfection, which calls for further remarks. I have said that I find it every- where and every day in nature. My begonia was a rare thing, however. I have never found its equal again. This is because the species is extraordinarily variable and sub- ject to unusual morphogenetical caprices which produce specimens often bizarre, dis- ordered, and far removed from the normal type. As a rule floral species are more true to their specific type and to formal perfec- tion at the moment of their opening and also as long as their bloom lasts. I am thinking of tulips, of narcissi, of fuchsias, of coeurs de Marie, of snapdragons, of col- umbines, whose forms, ingeniously fantastic and nevertheless clearly defined, are nearly always impeccably flawless. When the apple tree and cherry tree are covered with a superabundance of blossoms, the perfection of detail is a pure loss, for no one pays any attention to it. One could wager that per- fection is everywhere, however, and per- suade oneself by samplings made at random. This perfection and this specific unity al- ways fill me with astonishment. It is "nat- ural," you will tell me, but "natural" in itself is only a word which has no explana- tory value. In view of the prodigious com- plexity of living matter, the variability of its species, its instability, its morphological deviations, and the corruptibility of its typical structures would seem to me much more natural. The constancy and the in- definite transmissibility of specific aspects during thousands and millions of genera- tions astonish me and arouse my admira- tion; but for biologists they pose a problem whose solution is perhaps more fundamen- tal and more urgent than is that of their so-called "evolution," which has remained purely theoretical up to the present day. This constancy testifies to an unshaken physiological and biochemical perfection with which an irreproachable aesthetic per- fection often, if not always, coincides. So-called aesthetic perfection is only an illusion resulting from the imperfection of one's perceptive faculties and with the pre- sumptuous weakness of one's judicial fac- ulties. Here is the objection which has lain in wait for me since the beginning of my survey. By this reckoning our aesthetic pleasure is inversely proportional to our discernment. The less we are capable of seeing imperfections, the more and the bet- ter we are predisposed to aesthetic felicity. The meanest object suffices for our delecta- tion. Surely there exist amateurs in art who</page><page sequence="6">128 LUCIEN RUDRAUF are satisfied with little-a fact which is a bit distressing. Let us not despise them for that. It is something to care for or to have a feel- ing for the beautiful even if one is not a great expert. There are people who are hard to please, however, and their existence is necessary if the level of art is to be raised. There are "connoisseurs" and "experts," a fact which presupposes an ideal of aesthetic perfection and the mental faculty to conceive it and to discover its presence in reality. These great sensitive and intellectual faculties are by no means illusory, and many people are fortunate enough to be gifted with them, even though they are not named Goethe, Diderot, or Baudelaire. Great artists possess them to a marked degree, and they possess even more the privileged gift of making use of them. If we are thus gifted at birth, our duty is to cultivate these gifts at the risk of losing something to our naivete and our youthful spontaneity. We will gain by submitting to higher and more perfect joys. Let us not fear the difficulties and let us not recoil from exact and minute methods of analysis. But let us not be either pedants or maniacs. In the realm of natural forms, perfec- tion is a fact which it would be foolish to dispute. Perfection is exposed to damage from internal and external causes. These degradations, which make us feel the pri- mary excellence of perfection (for we judge it by reference to an ideal form known by numerous examples), can be serious and de- structive of all beauty. They are more often faint and almost imperceptible, not seri- ously prejudicial to our visual pleasure. A wart on an ideally beautiful face sadly af- fects our aesthetic susceptibility. Fortu- nately it is by nature superficial and easily remedied; one may even discover in it a new charm, as it was considered in good form to do in the siecle galant. Beauty is not synonymous with absolute perfection either in nature or in art, and it is stupid to deny its seductions and its joys because of some slight faults which disfigure it only in the eyes of extremists. It is in the art-forms of the hand crafts, however, that one may exact the highest degree of tech- nical perfection-in jewelry, for example, and in engraving where the cutting follows a rule so clearly defined and so rigorously systematized that the least deviation from and the least departure from the drawing are felt as intolerably bad work by every amateur, however lacking in knowledge and finesse he may be. Aqua fortis suffers less by accidents of biting and of inking, and skilled masters can sometimes achieve un- foreseen effects which even so it is wise not to abuse. In all skills which depend on manual dexterity it is advisable for the worker, for his client, to be hard to please. Thus it is with cabinet work, with tapestry, with ceramics, with metal casting, and with iron work, wonderful skills which comprise the glory of several periods of history, and the excellence of numerous styles which have succeeded one another in Europe and elsewhere since remote antiquity. Ruskin, very meticulous in the observation of details and graphic reproduction, held that perfec- tion in the decor sculpted in architecture is useless since it is impossible to examine it from close up. But in that case, the ability of the sculptor consists in foreseeing effects at a distance and adjusting his technique in the interests of the perfection of the whole. In every way, manual skill in the artists' crafts is a virtue which admits of no sabotage and fortifies itself to its utmost against the weaknesses to which our feeble nature is always exposed. Such was certainly the thought of Ruskin, who never coun- tenanced negligence and who all his life preached the high obligations of profes- sional conscience. It is good to remember that he did not have a rigid idea of perfec- tion and knew how to bend it to the re- quirements of the concrete. An excessive finickiness might be a fault in an object which is part of rustic suroundings. In this point of view there is an aesthetic relativism for which one ought to thank him. What we have said about perfection with reference to certain techniques of engraving and sculpture applies to the other domains of art; the dance, for example, and music, with respect to the execution of a serious amateur who wishes to perform well. The skill of the pianist, the violinist, the flutist is a manual skill which requires a long and difficult apprenticeship and constant prac-</page><page sequence="7">Perfection 129 tice to raise it to the point of virtuosity and to keep it there. To appreciate its perfec- tion, one needs an ear, as one needs an eye to appreciate painting. In great musical centers, the public at great concerts is gen- erally very sensitive to technical perfection, more so perhaps than the public at mu- seums, whom one sees pass absent-mindedly before astonishing works of art It really seems that in aesthetics there are more blind people than deaf ones. Attention is more concentrated in concert halls than in art galleries, especially on days when crowds are great. There is something fascinating about the prestige of a great virtuoso who performs so as to stress auditory pleasure and qualitative perception. Everyone does not benefit in the same degree, however, from the perfection of a superior execution. In this respect a remark of Eugene Dela- croix, who was devoted to music, is very instructive. Returning from a concert by Viardot, the famous singer, he noted in his Journals of January 15, 1856, "A magnifi- cent concert by Mme. Viardot: 'L'Air d' Armide,' Ernst, the violinist, pleased me. Telefsen told me at the princess' [Czar- torisky, I suppose] that he was very weak. I acknowledge my inability to distinguish any great difference between different per- formances when they have reached a certain standard." I do not know who Telefsen is, but without a doubt in the circle of the princess he had the reputation of being a great connoisseur, since Delacroix bowed to the superiority of his judgment without, however, depriving himself of the pleasure which he felt. That is very wise, I think, and seems to mean that in his opinion tran- scendent perfection is not indispensable to good and wholesome enjoyment of art. The feeling which we carry away from a concert at which the execution has been excellent must suffice to put us in a state of peace with our aesthetic conscience. An unhealthy sus- ceptibility in that respect wrongs both the composer and his interpreter. Love of perfection is surely a noble pas- sion provided that it does not turn into an obsession. One must strain in its direction and make an effort to approach it as closely as is humanly possible. I have said, and I am persuaded, that perfection exists in nature. In art also I know works which give me perfect satisfaction. But in both nature and art we can discern hierarchies of per- fection which justify the "beauty contest" which we set up for all sorts of animate or inanimate objects and in which our critical sense has an opportunity to exercise itself usefully. Our judgments, it is understood, are affected by an individual coefficient which conforms to the diversity of our per- ceptive and sensitive faculties, but also by one part of the totally intellectual idea of archetypes which we form for ourselves, such archetypes as we construct when we begin with concrete forms. Archetypes (that is to say, perfect models) are anterior to existing forms as they fall on our senses. They are co-eternal with the Creator of all things. However purely men- tal and withdrawn in their essence with re- spect to our visual or auditory perception, they are conceivable in their perfection and recognizable in real forms, thanks to the instruments of human science. They are the object of choice of what Thomas Munro calls "aesthetic morphology," which unites natural forms and forms of art. This "sci- ence of forms" already possesses a strongly developed theoretical apparatus composed of correct definitions and efficacious meth- ods of analysis. One could hope to make of it an exact and rigorous science, basically geometric and arithmetical, to begin with in the school of natural, biological, chemical, crystallographical sciences, subject to uni- versal laws valuable in the work of art forms, which it is foolish to want to make a universe apart since one recognizes no other law than that of human genius. I have the greatest respect for masters of art-painters, musicians, or poets. I admire them for their work, but I do not prostrate myself before their "divinity." They are neither gods nor demigods. The best of them would have avoided such adoration. Delacroix and Poussin would feel ill at ease to see their names inscribed at the head of a list of publications which a contemporary editor had undertaken to dedicate to the "demi- gods" of painting. These two classic masters, each in his own way, pursued a high ideal of perfection and tried to attain a degree of perfection from</page><page sequence="8">130 LUCIEN RUDRAUF which one could subtract nothing and to which one could add nothing without falsi- fying the sought-after effect, without com- promising the aesthetic viability of the work. Perfection for the man of the seventeenth century as for the man of the nineteenth- two high epochs in art-was a serious affair, heavy with noble human and professional scruples. Free as they doubtless were of material necessities-for they lived by their talent, but also free of low commercial speculations which, in our day, violate the normal play of supply and demand and the correct idea of artistic values-neither the one nor the other let himself be carried away by manual virtuosity, by palette phan- tasies designed to seduce merchants and clients. Let us in conclusion find it advisable to place under the aegis of these two masters these few reflections on aesthetic perfection. Their high example, their intellectual and professional honesty, testifies to the serious, at times pathetic, character of the great vocation of the artist. Art is a serious thing. Even under its pleasant and enjoyable as- pects, when it aims at perfection, it is not a frivolous game, a way, for better or worse, of filling our leisure time, of beguiling boredom in our idle moments. In the order of human activities, it answers to a vital need at the level of the highest spiritual as- pirations. Thomas Munro, and others with him, have dedicated their lives to make it an instrument of education. Who, then, would dare to say that such men have wasted their time and that of others in use- less games? Have not these so-called "games" developed man's highest faculties, sensitive, intuitive, and inventive, even among the most gifted of our race? In truth it is unsound to deny beauty or to debase it to a secondary role of pure luxury. "Le monde est plein de merveil- leuses choses." Not to wonder is stupidity and blasphemy. Were you the most power- ful writer of France, you would give proof of mental infirmity by casting a "blaspheme a Florence." Seeing the beauties of the world it is good and wise to say with Goethe: "Zum Erstaunen bin ich da." A free translation into French is: "Admirer la beaut6 est ma raison de vivre."
