The figurine, made from fired clay, about 11.5 cm high, represents a woman with a plump figure. More than 75 years after its discovery, a fingerprint on the left side of the figurine back was analyzed. The dimensions of the fingerprint are 3×5 mm and it is possible to recognize seven lines. The structure was identified as a negative of human friction skin based on the minutiae, ridge breadth, and other markers. Epidermal ridge breadth correlates with the age during growth period of an individual. We elaborated the original method for age estimation from fingerprint ridge breadth and used it to estimate the age of the fingerprint owner. The ridge breadth varies from 0.34 to 0.43 mm with an average of 0.37 mm. The estimation of age is 11.13 years. With respect to the preciseness and limits of the method the age of the fingerprint maker was somewhere between 7 and 15 years. This estimation is valid if the age/ridge breadth relation in the Paleolithic was similar to the present day one. It is also important to realize that the maker of the fingerprint may not be identical with the creator of the artifact. It is quite hard to believe that such a figurine as the Venus of Dolní Věstonice I could have been a work of beginner or even of a child. However, this approach has great potential to specify social circumstances of ceramics production. KEY WORDS: Fingerprint – Venus of Dolní Věstonice I – Gravettian – Epidermal ridge breadth – Age estimation INTRODUCTION In summer 2000 there was an article by Dr. Slavomír Brodesser in the daily newspaper Mladá fronta DNES The Venus of Dolní Věstonice I (Figure 1) was discovered dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the discovery of the on the 13th of July 1925 in Dolní Věstonice (Figure 2), Věstonice Venus (Brodesser 2000). The author cited one South Moravia (Czechoslovakia) during the Moravian of the discoverers, technician Emanuel Dania, who Museum's excavation directed by Professor Karel Absolon. mentioned the "obvious dactyloscopic imprint at the spine, It is a figurine made of fired clay, about 11.5 cm high, where the ancient artist left a fingerprint before the firing" representing a curvaceous female form. The figurine was (Dania 1962). We have been researching fingerprints on found in the central fireplace in the upper part of the Dolní ceramic materials for some time, and we considered Věstonice (locality of DV I) settlement. It was discovered ourselves competent to verify the newspaper's information, split in two unequal pieces, resting about 10 cm apart and to analyze this feature with the help of the original (Absolon 1938, 1939, 1945, 1949). The figurine has been methodology developed by Králík (2000), with a systems dated as Upper-Paleolithic of Gravettian Culture, whose approach (Novotný 1991), and to add to this prior research peak period was between 27 and 24 thousand years ago. on Gravettian art (Oliva 1997). The fingerprint is The Věstonice Venus became world famous because of the interesting because it had not yet been described in any exceptionality of the used material (world's oldest ceramics, relevant literature. As far as we know, the fingerprint was first ceramics ever!) and its typological uniqueness (Figure 3). neither mentioned by Karel Absolon, nor appeared in any 107 </page> <page sequence="2"> Miroslav Králík, Vladimír Novotný, Martin Oliva work analyzing Upper Paleolithic ceramic fragments or figurines. Yet the fingerprint is on the surface of one of the most famous archaeological finds in Moravia, one that was discovered more than 75 years ago. As a part of the Moravian Museum's research, the Věstonice Venus was screened and an analysis of the images was conducted from the paleodermatoglyphic perspective. (N.B. Paleodermatoglyphics is the study of fingerprints, palm-prints or footprints – so-called papillary terrain or friction skin – on prehistoric objects, mostly ceramics, with the hope of gaining some biological or other characteristics of the people who made the prints. Bartsocas 1982). METHODS Because the figurine is priceless, it can only be studied by nondestructive methods. For scanning we used macrophotography (a Praktica B100 electronic camera with macro, Olympus SZH 10 stereoscopic microscope with an Olympus zoom and a Kodak DS 260 digital camera). Lighting was provided by a halogen lamp and pointed source of light from a microscope. Calibration of the images was provided by square of calibrated paper. The area of the fingerprint was screened in several enlargements FIGURE 1.

We photographed the Věstonice Venus in its original case, sometimes adjusting its posture by inserting mustard seeds in an appropriate container. DESCRIPTION AND TRASEOLOGY The original surface of the figurine was polished; the present surface is complex, with many irregularities, traction lines, scratches and unstuck places. Although there are many structures that resemble epidermal ridges, only one of them is positive. At the back of the figurine, there is a compilation/sequence of several parallel lines, which truly suggest a print of epidermal ridges (Figure 4). From the paleodermatoglyphic perspective it is a fragmentary FIGURE 2.

This supports the evidence that the fingerprint originated before the firing of the PALEODERMATOGLYPHIC IDENTIFICATION figurine (Figure 5). After its discovery, the surface of the Venus was covered Without any apparent dermatoglyphic pattern there is no (conserved) with a varnish layer. This caused further direct evidence that the print is a real fingerprint.

The ridge breadth of the Věstonice Venus fingerprint ranges between 0.34 to 0.43 mm, which is within the range for contemporary populations (Figure 7).
