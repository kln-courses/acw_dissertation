<plain_text><page sequence="1">Racket Worship By J. M. Nolte Is our destiny to be the thug among the peoples of the earth ? Years before the War, M. ?mile Faguet, a brilliant French student of democratic institutions, wrote a criticism of the popular notion in his native country that the rule of the many is neces sarily wholesome. He called this study, The Cult of Incompetence. His observations were of such general application that the work was trans lated, and was widely read in Eng land and in America as an adequate statement of the shortcomings of democratic government. One of M. Faguet's dicta might be taken as the text for an after-the-War comment on the failure of American civiliza tion. "A principle," wrote M. Faguet, "has disappeared, a prejudice, if you like to call it so, the prejudice in favor of competence." To many, this may seem a flat understatement of what ails us, and there certainly have not lacked eloquent tongues to tell us wherein we have sinned, and to give high sounding and mystifying titles to the current diseases of the body politic. It is often in the easy de partures from simple verities, how ever, that the true causes of our ills must be sought. We all know the lazy hypochondriac who listens to the Latin names of his disorders with a martyr's ecstasy, and who forth with tries every sort of easily ad ministered medicament to cure him self. Any well-living child of twelve or fourteen could tell him in plain language that the cause of his bodily unease is indolence, but would he listen? Just so, I submit, have we persistently refused to look at the facts of our existence. As with the hypochondriac, it is to be doubted whether we shall be cured without a return to first principles. There is no road to health but the practice of health. To all such strictures as the fore going, our answer latterly has been a destructive cynicism which shrugs them aside as bromidic; and it is with a full realization of this mis fortune that the statement of M. Faguet is again emphasized: we have lost our prejudice in favor of com petence. Bromide or no bromide, that is the dose America must sooner or later swallow. The long descent of all those indexes which have become our clinical thermometers and cardi ographs of national well-being ought to be evidence enough that some new treatment is imperative.</page><page sequence="2">RACKET WORSHIP 511 America has a bad case of the rackets. This disease is the most insidious, the most elusive, the most degenerating, the most enervating that has ever become endemic in a civilization. It includes in its effects all that was most reprehensible in the latter fatuity of the Roman State, all that was most repulsive in the lethargy of the French of the ancien r?gimey all that we sneer at in the stodgy dry-rot of Victorian England. It is worse, because the fat and inert population of Rome was interlarded with sound, fibrous barbarian streaks of lean; the soft ness of the luxurious court of the Bourbons was offset by the avari cious hardness of an energetic and progressive bourgeoisie; and even the smug upper classes of Queen Victoria's England were matched and outwitted by laboring middle and lower classes still responsive to the call of old traditions bred of Elizabethan assertiveness and Puri tan industry and common sense. America presents to a disordered but somewhat complacently malicious world the spectacle of an entire people divorced not only from its traditional and still reiterated moral ity, but also from those policies and precepts which its own prosaic eco nomic experience has abundantly justified. Uncle sam has the rackets. And like the old Southern mammy with her jumping fits, he might well exclaim, "When I has 'em, I has 'em!" There is no class or part of our society exempt from the disease. It afflicts high and low, well-born and base, rich and poor, young and old, Democrats and Republicans, Wets and Drys. That is the real Twentieth Century tragedy. Let us describe the disease. To the ordinary citizen, a "racket" is simple enough. It is just a situation in which a person is forcibly compelled to pay an extra price for a com modity or a service to one who has no legitimate function to perform in the production or distribution of that product or service. This defini tion is warped a trifle in the case of the big bootleggers, who are also popularly supposed to be producers, but even here the meaning of the term racket contains a large element of forcible and uneconomic control. The racket is the game or business of eliciting this unmerited reward by means of force or fraud, and a racketeer is one who makes his living by a racket. This concept held by the man in the street is accurate, and will serve as well as any. But the man in the street does not see, and apparently can not be brought to see, that much is included in the definition to which he has given an approval by no means grudging or qualified. He sees his neighbor as a racketeer, but seldom himself. When he sees him self, it is through the rose-colored glass of mitigation or condonement. Least of all does he understand that his attitude of compliance, whatever the excuses he may make for it, is a way of telling the world that he has lost his prejudice in favor of com petence. Who, then, are the real racketeers ? Not only Al Capone, who is figu ratively "taking the rap" for a much more numerous class than his gangster friends. Not only the host of parasites battening on the gross</page><page sequence="3">512 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW body of organized crime ? lawyers and judges and bailiffs and policemen and enforcement officers and what not. Not merely these and the entire mass of citizens who buy the wares that the bootleggers have to sell. Nor even the business men who think more of their livelihood than of their self-respect and who there fore let themselves be browbeaten and bulldozed into unlawful tribute to gangdom. One must look farther; for it is one of the axioms of polity that the mores must sanction an in stitution before it can succeed, and the racket as we know it has become an institution and has succeeded. There was a broad public employ ment of the theory involved in racketeering before the days of Capone. We all know about the birth of that sanction, if we will only reflect. It was not Prohibition that con ceived it, although there is evidence that Prohibition played midwife at the delivery. You will find the life cell of racketeering alive in America from the days of the clipper ships and the legend of the Yankee and his wooden nutmegs. You will be able to trace the multiplication of that cell through the supply scandals of every war in which we have engaged. The latest war was only one of many: 1917 was like 1898, only there was a career open to more talents; 1898 was true to the tradi tions of 1861; 1861 was only 1812 on a grander scale; 1812 was scarcely more flagrant than 1777. Weevily biscuit and shoddy clothing and em balmed beef and useless spruce: they are equally inglorious chapters of our history. You will find a coin cidental growth of racketeering in the tales of railroad building, in the episodes of land stealing, of timber theft, of mineral theft, of water power theft. You will find it in the story of freight rebating, of railroad rate making, of corporate finance. Particularly will you find it in the industries supplying coal and electric power and gas and water to our cities. The racketeer was with us long before the gangster carried the implications of the racket to their logical conclusion, which is open warfare with society, Ishmaelism. The new element is not the racket; it is our avid acceptance of it. It is an unescapable truth that the uneconomic use of a power which is monopolistic in nature must breed one of two things: it must breed repugnance and rebellion and hate, or it must breed compliance and acceptance and love. We had our age of moral indignation, witness, The Man of the Hour, the Sher man law, Theodore Roosevelt, Gif ford Pinchot, Charles Evans Hughes. Really, very little came of it. Char acteristically, love of the racket fol lows enjoyment of a portion of its gains. We bought our common stocks and ceased to cast stones. The word "love," perhaps, with its softly sentimental connotation, is less appropriate than desire or lust, but if you think these terms are too strong to describe our devo tion to the racket, try to separate a political hanger-on (be it a janitor or an undersheriff or a schoolma'am) from part of his too easily earned wage. Try to convince a power mag nate that it is a sin to buy a hydro electric site for a song and then to capitalize it and recapitalize it and</page><page sequence="4">RACKET WORSHIP 513 re-recapitalize it in multiples of the actual cost. Try to reduce the budget of an American city. Try to induce a manufacturer of an article of pat ented utility to market his product at a reasonable cost plus a reasonable profit. A further testimony to our unholy worship of the racket is the fact that a large percentage of our cur rent comment about it makes a literature of condonement. People don't bother to excuse what they are determined to extirpate. It is glibly explained, as though the ex planation could somehow make us feel better, that there have been good causes for our departure from the ways of common honesty. La borers became racketeers, we are told, because there appeared to be no other way in which they could obtain a living wage. Entrepreneurs became racketeers because the fiction of corporate life fastened upon them the necessity of dominance in their lines of endeavor. Corporations be came racketeers because the vicis situdes of existence in a world of popular control of law compelled them to provide a hidden cushion against the blows of outrageous fortune in the form of unprincipled taxation. Freeholders became rack eteers because an outworn tax sys tem loaded upon them an uncon scionable share of the burdens of government. All of these things are doubtless true. They represent, in all probability, an analysis of our his tory which traces accurately the progress of our disease. But in the main they accentuate our hypo chondria. They are the words of doctors who say to us, " Your manner of living has been wrong, all wrong, for years and years." There they stop. Our physicians diagnose, but do not prescribe. At best, such prescription as is offered is of a palliatory nature. Sedatives are recommended: "Try a little more protective tariff." We are told to take a physic: "Inflation of the currency, with a consequent higher price level, will start things moving again." We are advised to do a little blood letting: "A minor war would be the best thing in the world right now." Some of our doc tors insist upon giving us stimulants: "The return of liquor will bring back prosperity." None of these medicines is a specific for our con dition. The fundamental reason why we get these unsatisfactory answers from those to whom we apply for advice is simply that the political and eco nomic physicians have themselves become racketeers. They know that we are not ready for really curative treatment. Like our bankers, our lawyers, our preachers, they have become merchants merely. They give us what they know we want. Deep in the dear agony of our hypochondria, we prefer pills to sound clinical counsel. We have not yet succumbed to that terrorizing fear which makes submission to sur gery the only practicable course. In this so-called year of our Lord, 1932, every department of our life, individually and as a nation, is disordered and chaotic. It is not yet apparent to the unthinking that we are going to wallow in the doldrums until we are once more integrated; but in the course of a few more months we shall all realize that such</page><page sequence="5">514 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW is the unavoidable truth. Whether we like it or not, the world has reached a point in its development where human solidarity is the great prerequisite of any national life whatsoever. The unintegrated state is doomed. It appears that there is a more general recognition of this fact in Russia than in any country o Western civilization, with the possif ble exceptions of Italy and England; and it further appears that in the long run the success of the Russian experiment will depend not entirely upon the effectiveness of the nation as a diligent steward of natural resources, but mainly upon the na tion as a group imbued with a philosophical conception and gal vanized by it into practical activity. There are many things that we as a people can do without. We have learned hundreds of them in the past years of distress; we shall no doubt learn hundreds more in the months immediately to come. Philosophy, a philosophy, is not one of them. The most minute ramifications of our so-called business life will be found dependent, not in any abstruse or recondite significance, but in the soberest of sober truth, upon a national philosophical conception of our place in the world as a nation, and our part in the scheme as in dividuals. This philosophy, moreover, must necessarily begin by wiping from the slate many of our present ideas of what is tolerable in the behavior of individuals and of states. There is no alternative that we dare to contemplate. The Malthusian proph ecy is near enough to fulfilment to insure that the world, at least the civilized world, the division-of-labor world, is on the threshold of sociali zation of many services and com modities formerly assigned to private endeavor by a recognition of pre scriptive right. If we do not grasp this revolutionary trend and utilize it, we may have a temporary boom in our fortunes, but our degeneracy as a people will continue, and we shall find ourselves at the beginning of a very dark age indeed. What might be termed our na tional subconscious mind is already in accord with this thought, as is shown by the tendency toward State regulation, control and partici pation in affairs hitherto exclusively private, accompanied by a relative increase in the percentage of national income spent for taxes. This trend, and the increase in taxes, have con tinued in spite of the bad times which we have had since 1919 (and not merely since 1929, as many journalists would have us believe). They will continue still, in spite of our present frenzy to get a dollar's worth of materials and labor for our tax dollar. The phenomenal growth of life insurance investments during recent years may be taken as another index of our intuitive or subconscious realization that some distributive system must be devised which gives a chance to the man of consistent thrift but limited opportunity and attainments ? the "forgotten man" of Sumner's immortal essay. A moment's reflection will make clear the fact that all this is just another way of saying that the racket must go. The racket is the modern epitome of particularism, and particularism can not thrive in the cooperative milieu brought about</page><page sequence="6">RACKET WORSHIP 515 by community enterprise. All of the paternalistic and cooperative plans nourished by taxation and by life insurance involve fiduciary relation ships; and such relationships by their very nature exclude the dishonest individualism which is responsible for racketeering. To continue to per mit the dominance of the racket is national suicide, unless, perhaps, we frankly call the worse the better reason, jettison the old principles of character, and become a nation of racketeers, a thug among the peoples of the earth. The path of racketeering is the path of license. It has always led directly to the graveyard of forlorn hopes, where vain ambitions are buried and the bones of those supreme particu larists, the gigantic saurians, lie em bedded in the sedimentary deposits of prehistory. Each succeeding generation be lieves that the conditions sur rounding its endeavors differ from the conditions of each other genera tion. Of course that is superficially true. It is also indubitably true, however, that the wisest and sanest students of mortal conditions in all ages have agreed upon one thing: that for the ordinary human being life is a precarious, tedious and toil some occupation. Because scientific pursuits have latterly accelerated almost beyond comprehension the rate of consumption of natural re sources in the world, the impression has spread through the civilized countries that this axiom of the ages is false. The multiplication of things, it is assumed, will result in the dis semination of those things through out society, so that all will enjoy an abundance of everything. It is gen erally overlooked in the discussion of our material well-being that dis semination does not inevitably follow easily upon production. We have recently discovered to our intense distress that those who control production have a contrary idea. We have been edified by the pathetic picture of a countryful of food and clothing and luxuries, and a popula tion ready to consume, but denied the privilege. What is responsible for that de nial? Most writers upon the subject seem to beg the question by saying that the monetary system has proved faulty. The monetary system has emphasized the ineptness of our dis tributive machinery, but to allege it as a responsible cause of anything is the veriest bosh. It is as intelligent as if we were to blame the sea for not floating a ship which we made too heavy for the water it displaced. It is another concession to hypo chondria. The failure of finance, national and international, is at tributable to a failure of responsi bility on the part of the human beings who manipulated the engines of finance. The wreck of our dis tributive machinery is directly at tributable to the selfish carelessness of the engineers who manned it. It is attributable to the racket and to the racketeers. That includes all of us. It includes the worker who suc cumbed to the temptation to exact high pay for inferior work just as surely as it includes the banker who substituted avarice for judgment in the investments he urged upon his clientele. We all knew better a gen eration ago. But the racket seemed to work, and we all became racke</page><page sequence="7">5i6 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW teers. We became thing-minded. The deepest pathos of our present state is that we have tried our best to rear a new generation which has no conception of the world except in terms of things. To the rising youth of today, the racket is a national institution. If you do not think so, watch your children as they play "cops and robbers" in the yard, as they listen to the radio, as they choose their movies, as they read the daily comics in the news papers. It is a harsh thing to say that America has been a seminar of dis honesty throughout its later his tory. Is it not the fact? The old prejudices in favor of plain forth right love of truth are pretty well gone ? let us hope not beyond possibility of recovery. "How one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets what destroys him among so much that is evil. Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity." So wrote Machiavelli in 1513. Where would he find himself and his philosophy more at home than in present day particularist America ? The apologists for our wayward ness insist that the old ideas of hon esty were the by-products of the benighted superstition that paraded as religion before we grew up and became wise. It was easy to draw a line between right and wrong when the fathers told us what was right and what was wrong, and no one had gumption or sense enough to question the authority of the fa thers. It was easy to be honest when honesty was really the best policy. It was easy to live the upright life when the delusion of free will and the myth of election by faith were realities to a simple-minded and gullible people. But when psycholog ical study has cast overwhelming doubts upon the percentage of indi vidually controlled thoughts and actions permitted to any one, when man has descended from his godlike state and become the creature of the centuries, what then? If the roots of morality are nourished by the spring of tender, personal devotion on the part of an anthropomorphic God, ever flowing through the rich soil of assuredly benevolent predestination ? and then some one suddenly proves that an anthropomorphic God is as much a myth as Santa Claus and predestination an un predictable and ugly mortmain, what is left to the formerly devout save bold and cynical apostasy? The modern point of view admits two possibilities: self-hypnosis by a denial of intelligence, and clear eyed agnosticism through consecra tion to fact. "Given the premise," the new thoughters might say, "that age long determinism guides invisibly our destinies, stretching its long, powerful, gripping dead fingers down the years, fashioning the cell-reser voirs of the race unpredictably into a plasm of beneficence or of offense, alliance with traditional ideas of honesty is at best a marriage of con venience. Integrity becomes an im possible idea, both for conduct and</page><page sequence="8">RACKET WORSHIP 517 for soul. We have no right, indeed, to claim a soul; we possess at the most an enigmatic congeries of diverse emotions and impulses. Why quarrel with circumstance? What price honesty?" It is asserted that this new view of the destiny of our race ? which in cidentally enfranchises fraud and the rule of force ? involves a real devotion to truth, whereas the wor ship of the forms of outworn religious idealism would today be treason to truth. There is something to be said for this hypothesis. It includes all that is noblest in the battle cry of those positivists of the last century, who cried aloud in real anguish, "Under the bludgeonings of Chance, my head is bloody but unbowed!" Better the rigors of disillusion than the opiate of superstition. Better Ingersoll than Pollyanna! But would it not seem upon re flection that this modern view is perhaps too belligerent, too assertive, too lacking in a sense of humor? For if it is to be demonstrably true that the dead hand of heredity guides and governs us, surely the affair is not worth all the fuss that the unbending agnostics make over it! And by no twisting of logic can it be made to appear reasonable that heredity can be fortuitous and de luding only in those impulses which we inwardly recognize as spiritual. Granted that free-will may be an illusion; must it therefore be a futile illusion? Granted that our im pulses come from behind the be yond, why should we distrust those impulses which urge us to ratify the conclusions of the elder race, even when those conclusions are vitiated by long association with supersti tion? God is still the unknown, and the blank wall of his mystery, al though far removed, still confronts the aspiring seeker after the ultimate truth. Exchange the specific inter ference of a personal deity for the vague and apparently random in terference of an hereditary strain; after all, we have only altered the name of a concept which still re mains unexplained. If heredity nudges us and whispers, "This do; this believe!" why must we refuse to heed? May not the quiet tone, the frequent still small voice be quite as authentic as the stentorian impera tive that actuates us when we go berserk and smash the ten com mandments? From whatever angle the ap proach to our modern imbro glio, all paths lead to the premise that those who exhibit power in the world have become dishonest. Car lyle dared to thunder, "I find one strong thing here below, the just thing, the true thing." Disregarding the fact that his statement was a credo rather than an observation, it is doubtful if Carlyle could justify his optimism by a glance at the world today. We have lost our prej udice in favor of competence; we have bestowed the accolade upon the audacious and the clever; we have re-crucified Jesus and set up Til Eulenspiegel. The modern psychological icono clasm has still left us, however, an idealistic conception worth preserv ing, the most plausible of them as well as the grandest: that which envisages the solidarity of the hu man species. Whatever mistakes we may have made in our long history</page><page sequence="9">5i8 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW as a race, it is at least true that we are triumphant mammals because we have been cooperative. With God discounted, that irreducible minimum remains as a bulwark for faith in honesty. Solidarity is just as necessary today for humanity, for America, as it was for the little mammals in the Cretaceous who learned to break the eggs of the tyrannosaur and to feed their fam ilies upon the contents. Human solidarity is not possible without honesty. Chesterton once wrote, "Every man seeks for the truth, but God alone knows who has found it." That is perhaps as much as one can say about eternal verity today. But honesty does not imply that the truth must be known. Honesty im plies no more and no less than utter loyalty to our vision of the truth. We have not lost our vision, al though it is for the present obscured by a vicious astigmatism. It is our loyalty that we have lost, as a peo ple and as a civilization. Without it, all is chaos. Until it is regained, there is small hope for us, in the mass, as individuals. Our return to the ways of honesty is retarded by our devotion to the racket. We are almost all benefi ciaries, in an ephemeral sense, no Ci^S doubt, of racketeering in some form or other. An overwhelming majority of us lack the courage to make our revolt against dishonesty serious enough to interfere with our jobs or our incomes. "Better to bear the evils that we have than fly to oth ers that we know not of." In spite of illusive fluctuations in trade and on exchange, however, and even in America, the land of the golden spoon, conditions will be sufficiently bad in the next few months to make the revolt possible for most of us. We shall suddenly see clearly once more, and we shall believe that he, and he alone, who does his work well shall be fairly paid for that work. We shall resume our prejudice in favor of competence, and conduct our lives by it. There will be a few stalwart souls to start the custom, and we shall probably incontinently stone them; but the seed of their example will remain deeply planted, warmed by the sunlight of racial conviction that illumines all of us, watered by the tears of our adver sity. Some day it will wax and burgeon, and much that we today tolerate in the way of economic and social privilege will wither in its shade. We shall worship at another tree Yggdrasil, the Yggdrasil of integrity. 'e^iD</page></plain_text>
