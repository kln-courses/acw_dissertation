IT IS one of the ironies of architectural history that the understanding of the High Gothic cathedrals, those unparalleled examples of clarity and manifestatio, should re- main clouded by confusion and contradiction. More than its sister cathedrals of Reims and Amiens, Chartres has defied compelling analysis. The venerable history of the site has been enveloped in a literary mantle of mystery and romantic legend woven from the phantasms of Druid priests, the blood of early-Christian martyrs, and the lofty faith of the thirteenth century. Moreover the maze of changes in the architectural fabric coupled with the absence of direct documentation presents a formidable chal- lenge to even the most rigorous scholar. It is only in the last twenty years that the impasse of the east-west or west-east construction debate, embodied by the interchange between Paul Frankl and Louis Grodecki during the 1950s and early 1960s, has been broken. In his landmark study of 1965 ("Histoire de la construction de la cathedrale de Chartres apres 1194/Die Baugeschichte der Kathedrale Notre-Dame de Chartres nach 1194," Memories de la Socite' archeologique d'Eure-et-Loir 23 [1965], 79-126), Jan van der Meulen boldly proposed an east and west sequence of campaigns, suggesting that the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 957 building rose as a whole with a slight advance of work in the nave, a position that has now gained general currency. Chartres: Biographie der Kathedrale and Chartres: The Masons Who Built a Legend ad- vance their respective authors' earlier work. The former draws together studies of the past quarter century, while James's book can be viewed as an abridgment of his highly controversial Contractors of Chartres (2 vols., Dooralong, Australia, 1979-81). In that book he argued that the cathedral was the product of a series of individual contractors who worked in short, disjointed campaigns with little overall guidance or supervision. Despite points of convergence - the writers agree that the building is a "mess," that the nave rose before the choir, that a new west facade was planned then abandoned fundamentally different assumptions underlie their views of the process by which the cathedral was shaped. For James, Chartres is a pristine Gothic building erected be- tween 1194 and 1225 and its final form the result of the accumulated contributions of strongly defined personalities. Just as Wilhelm Voge read in the fall of drapery or the curve of a lip the character of a particular artist, the genius of a Headmaster, the archaism of an older master of Saint-Denis, James creates individuals from masonry joints, dimensional changes, molding profiles, and stair tower windows. Ruby "is a mason with a quarryman's sense of solidity," Bronze is "a dreamer," and Scarlet a "cunning geometrician and a profound philosopher." The problems inherent in James's anthropomorphic approach have been signaled in other reviews, most sensitively by Lon Shelby, "The Contractors of Chartres," Gesta 20 (1981), 174-80. The hypothetical edifice of the system of contractors is raised on a foundation of circular argument: the formal variations are interpreted to suggest the activity of numerous crews whose rapid succession is revealed by these same changes. However, validation of this theory, which finds its most eloquent support in the Babel- like confusion of stone shown in illustration 76 (page 118), must come from other and external types of evidence. For example, Edson Armi's study of Burgundian Romanesque masons and sculptors advanced a convincing argument, based upon the converging indices of exacting masonry analysis, sculptural details, and the "documen- tation" afforded by a pool of masons' marks, for a relatively stable regional workshop engaged in several simultaneous projects. Unfortunately James applies his Chartres results to other buildings, such as Amiens and Reims, as a means of confirming his earlier conclusions. Yet Dieter Kimpel has demonstrated in his innovative articles on the evolution of stonecutting techniques the variety of procedures among the major High Gothic ateliers and, significantly, that irregularities may result simply from im- perfections in the techniques of prefabrication rather than from a change of personnel. It is the lack of historical rigor and context that most seriously undermines Chartres: The Masons Who built a Legend. The bewildering explanation of each contractor's system of design barely and only arbitrarily acknowledges the presence of the earlier cathe- dral structures whose partial retention profoundly affected the Gothic edifice. Like- wise the topography of the site, the situation of the cathedral as part of an episcopal- capitular complex, and its particular relation to and patterns of use by town and visitors are not considered seriously as factors that shaped the monument. In a larger framework James has not availed himself of the extensive literature on the organiza- tional, technical, and sociological aspects of construction against which his theories might have been checked. James's book is studded with acute observations, and its insistence on the importance of stair towers and door copings as construction indices is valuable. But the attempt to</page><page sequence="3">958 Reviews humanize each stone, to individualize every anomaly results in a book that moves uncertainly from accessible, but serious, scholarship to historical novel and personal meditation. Read with care, it stimulates questions concerning High Gothic building methods; taken at face value it deepens the mysteries of Chartres. Jan van der Meulen and Jurgen Hohmeyer plead for a new beginning in the study of Chartres, freed from the formal and aesthetic preoccupation that has led to the manufacture and enshrinement of artistic personalities. Close reading of the cathe- dral's lithic text allows the deciphering of a sequence of decisions taken during con- struction and an understanding of subsequent alterations. For these authors "Ruby," "Olive," and "Bronze" did not rapidly succeed one another in consecutive years, but were spread across centuries. Chartres reveals "the deformations and scars of a devel- opment to which it was subject almost like a living organism." The book begins with a warning that sounds a keynote of its argumentation: neither the religious nor the visual experience of Chartres in the late twentieth century is the same as that of the Middle Ages. The present transcendental gloom of the interior is the result of a marked dulling and darkening of the glass and the loss of the original wall paint (red joint on white ground) and of the lively yellow, green, and red embel- lishment of ribs and keystones. Moreoover the exterior sculpture has been stripped of its vivid polychromy and the cathedral itself freed from its satellite buildings. Not only must we reconstruct these losses, but we must subtract the additions, alterations, and restorations if an accurate picture of the process of construction as well as the charac- ter and purpose of Chartres is to be retrieved. The biography begins on 11 June 1194 with the famous fire that reportedly devas- tated church and town. However, it seems likely that significant portions of the old cathedral survived. After decoding the conception and symbolic significance of the plan and elevation within the framework of Western architecture since late antiquity, van der Meulen and Hohmeyer move rapidly into a terse sketch of the stages of construction in chapters 4 and 5 based upon masonry breaks, irregularities in plan, sculptural decoration, and the remains of tie beams. Chapters 6 to 8 focus upon the radical modifications that the decision to preserve the twelfth-century portals and towers effected in the original scheme. Elaborating on the theories of Hans Kunze, the authors offer a detailed reconstruction of the intended west front by drawing upon the parti of the nave and the architecture and sculpture of the transept terminals which initially were intended for that facade. Chapter 9 investigates the choir, chapters 10 and 11 the transept. The problems presented by the lateral arms of Chartres are particularly difficult to grasp, as shown by the antipodal conclusions reached by the authors. For James, the transept was built as planned, each facade with three monumental portals and porch. Hohmeyer and van der Meulen hypothesize that the transept was first envisioned to be one bay shorter, was then extended but begun with a single central portal to be flanked by windows in the aisle bays, transformed once again into a triple entrance and twin tower format, and finally enriched with the addition of the foreportals. The later history of these facades is no less complex, for they bear the traces of fourteenth-, sixteenth-, and seventeenth-century work. The evidence marshaled is impressive and the conclusions generally plausible, although it is difficult to concur that the statue of Ste. Modeste of the north-transept porch is the product of historicizing restoration rather than of bona fide Gothic artistry or the north rose a design of the Flamboyant period. While the tracery of the great wheel is unprecedented in the thirteenth cen- tury, it might be remembered that experimentation was rife during that period, from</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 959 the centripetal designs of Laon and Reims, to the radiating network of Paris, to the unusual square and triangle pattern of Lausanne. The final chapters include a valuable survey of the buildings that once surrounded the cathedral, the evolution of the crypt from Gallo-Roman to modern times, and an outline of the sculptural program. The fascinatingly tortuous history of the crypt, transformed in a series of cloak-and-dagger campaigns in the seventeenth century aimed at obliterating pagan reminiscences, was explored at length in van der Meulen's Notre-Dame de Chartres: Die vorromanische Ostanlage (Berlin, 1975). The proposition that the masonry which mantels the now-subterranean chapels and fits so maladroitly with the superstructure dates possibly to the episcopacy of Fulbert in the eleventh century solves a host of problems. The reinterpretation of the west portal Ascension as a Creation summarizes the substantive case presented by van der Meulen in The West Portals of Chartres Cathedral, 1: The Iconology of Creation (Washington, D.C., 1981). The authors describe their work as "a guidebook to the real cathedral," but it is much more and challenges established opinion at every turn. Before modern scholar- ship can dissect the thoughts of the thirteenth-century architect, before it can weave webs of geometry, venture an explanation of the dynamics of choice and change, or pronounce on the stylistic personality of an atelier, an accurate image of the medieval structure must be won through archaeological, archival, and historical research. By calling every stone into question, van der Meulen and Hohmeyer have returned Chartres to this purer form and cleared the way for a lucid comprehension of the most charismatic of Gothic cathedrals.
