MYCENAEAN RELIGION By MICHAEL JAMESON Much has been written about the religion of the people who lived around the Aegean in the prehistoric period. Together with their art, religion seemed to be that aspect of their culture about which purely material remains could tell us most. Scenes on rings and seal- stones, on carved stone vases, on palace frescoes and on sarcophagi, shrines in houses and palaces, cult places on mountain tops and in caves, and the specialized ritual furniture have all been studied in detail. Attempts have been made to combine this information with the tradi- tions of the later Greeks (starting with Homer in the late eighth century b.c.). For all its skilful reconstruc- tion the picture of "Minoan-Mycenaean" religion - for it was inevitable that on the basis of art the Cretan and mainland religions should seem to be one - remained, without comprehensible texts, speechless and motion- less, a still photograph of anonymous performers in a lost pageant. Since the last war archaeological research has enlarged and enriched this picture. On Crete, for instance, it has become clear that shortly after 2000 B.c. cults flourished on a number of mountain tops where great bonfires were lighted, and various offerings, especially clay figurines of men and animals, were thrown into the fire. One purpose, at least, was the invocation of supernatural help against destructive pests, to judge by figurines of clay beetles (Figure 1) ; another was to benefit the health of the wor- shipers by throwing into the fire images of parts of the human body afflicted with disease. In the course of time the bonfire rites were replaced by small chamber shrines, and then the cults declined, to revive again only near the end of the Bronze Age. From the Greek mainland have come new and vivid illustrations of the ceremonies that accompanied the burial of the noble dead. From the fifteenth to the twelfth century B.c. they were buried in tholos or "bee- hive" tombs set either in hillsides or in the ground with a mound of earth and probably a stone marker placed on top, and approached by a long, straight pas- sageway. During the course of cleaning and restoring such a tomb at Marathon in Attica the skeletons of two horses were found carefully buried in a shallow depres- sion near the beginning of the passageway (Figure 2). They were the dead prince's horses, which drew his chariot for the last time when they brought his corpse to the tomb. After rich gifts and a last meal had been de- posited, the horses were killed and buried, and the en- trance to the tomb closed until another member of the prince's family should need burial. In the Homeric poems, whose heroes are kings of the Mycenaean period, the beehive tombs are forgotten ; instead of being laid in trenches in the floors of tombs, the great dead are burned on funeral pyres and their ashes gathered in urns, but we still read of "four strong-necked horses," along 33</page><page sequence="2">2.

Religion continued with two of the dogs that used to be fed from the hero's table, and twelve Trojan captives, all slain at the pyre of Patroclus ( Iliad xxiii. 171 ff.). The most important contribution of archaeology to prehistoric Greek religion has been in another direction. Archaeology has shown more and more convincingly that in the second millennium b.c. the mainland of Greece was the home of an independent Mycenaean cul- ture, whose members probably spoke Greek and were ethnically related to other speakers of Indo-European languages, such as the Italic, Germanic, Hittite and Indie speakers. The veneer of a Cretan-inspired Minoan art might conceal a different religion among the Greeks of the mainland. This distinction between Crete and the mainland paved the way to the decipherment of the clay tablets inscribed in the syllabic Linear B script. In con- trast to the earlier Linear A, found only on Crete, these texts are Greek and are found at Pylos and Myce- nae, as well as at Knossos. (Incidentally, religious evi- dence does much to confirm the decipherment - the occurrence of six obviously divine names out of thirteen "recipients" on a single tablet cannot be put down to coincidence, especially when the name of Zeus is fol- lowed by that of Hera [Pylos Tn3l6] ) . Despite the diffi- culty in their interpretation these tablets give us much information about the religion of the Mycenaean Greeks, and this information is of a totally different kind from what had been available before. For this the most important tablet is the one from Pylos known as Tn3l6 (Figure 3), which lists offerings of gold vessels and of men and women to various di- vinities at a series of shrines. The gift of men and women may show the origin of the "slaves of the god" mentioned elsewhere in the tablets. Every translation of this text so far proposed has aroused serious objections, and the one that follows will be no exception. It will at least suggest what a wealth of information is to be found in these texts. This tablet I take to be an inventory of benefactions made by Proitos in the kingdom of Pylos, while other benefactions elsewhere may have been recorded on other 34</page><page sequence="3">3.

Photographs by Alison Frantz. tablets with corresponding regional designations in large letters on the left. The blank spaces may be the result of preparing the tablet and then copying out the Pylian section from a master list, the copy then being sent to or left at Pylos. In myth the name Proitos is as- sociated with the kings of Argos. The scope of his bene- factions suggests a supra-regional position, perhaps as one of the Mycenaean overlords of the Argive plain. There are records of the assignment of oil and ointment for his use to two groups of courtly functionaries, the wanassoi , i.e., the "royal attendants," and the di-pi- st'O(i), during his stay at Pylos. An alternative rendering of the heading (po-ro-wi-to-jo) is "in the month of sail- ing," and it has been suggested that the gold vessels were displayed on this occasion rather than donated, the men and women being cupbearers. This last, at any rate, will not work: sometimes there are more cups than bear- ers, sometimes more bearers than cups.

Photograph courtesy of Sp. Marinatos. Religion continued The gods' names themselves are of interest. Zeus and Poseidon, who (with Apollo) are the leading male gods of Homer, are already prominent at Pylos - particularly Poseidon, whose Pylian attachments are also strong in the Odyssey. The familiar Hera, Hermes and Artemis (to mention the more certain examples) are found at Pylos; Athena, Ares, and Paian (a healing god for whom a Cretan home had already been postulated) at Knossos. Eleuthia (Eileithyia), a goddess of childbirth whose cave at Amnisos near Knossos is mentioned by Homer and the geographer Strabo, receives a pot of honey sent to Amnisos. The cave has been explored and shows evidence of cult use in prehistoric and historic times (Figure 4). It may be pure accident that the sur- viving tablets are silent about some well known Greek THE AUTHOR, now Associate Professor of Classics at the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania, studied at the University of Chicago, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and the Institute of Social Anthropology, Oxford University.

Platon, who are, however, not responsible for the views expressed here. To others he hopes to make acknowl- edgement, with a defence of his own views, in a fuller study. gods such as Apollo. Dionysos, whose name is read once on a Pylos tablet, appears earlier than most scholars had expected. Clearly, much of the later Greek pantheon was already established by the thirteenth century b.c. and very likely much earlier. Alongside familiar gods are names previously un- known such as the goddesses Ma-na-sa and Posidaeia and the gods Triseros and Despotas (the "Thrice-mighty Lord" and "The Master") of Tn3l6. This is not sur- prising, for even in historical times there were many divine names peculiar to a locality, and many more can be recovered from the titles given to more familiar gods: for instance Chthonia, "She of the earth," is shown by inscriptions to be the earlier name of the goddess later called Demeter Chthonia at the little town of Hermione in the Argolid; Di-ri-mi-jo(s) , a "son of Zeus" (?) at Pylos, may survive in the form Drumnios, as a title of Zeus. Probably many Mycenaean gods were completely lost in the disturbances that followed the Mycenaean Age. Other gods were only half -forgotten : Persa, Iphe- medeia and Diwia, known in myth - the last two also in cult but only in barely Greek Pamphylia and Caria - are found together in the third paragraph of the text trans- lated above. These three, and Zeus, Hera and Di-ri-mi- jo(s), and the three goddesses at Pa-ki-ja-na (in the first paragraph) may all occupy "triple shrines" such as are known on Crete (at Knossos and Vathypetro) and rep- 36</page><page sequence="5">5.

The heads of worshipers fill the whole field. resented in one of the frescoes at Pylos (Figure 5). This is by no means a primitive stage of religion. Diwia and Posidaeia are obvious female versions of Zeus (stem Diw-) and Poseidon and yet they are not paired with them. The situation is already complex. Zeus' s chief consort is clearly Hera, who follows him in the list. This may not have been the case everywhere in My- cenaean cult - it was not in Classical cult; it could indi- cate, rather, the strong ties between Pylos and the Ar- give plain (the region of Mycenae, Argos and Tiryns), where Hera was preeminent, and confirms the close connection between the Homeric poems and Pylian tra- ditions. The presence of Athena at Knossos shows that if she was once simply the local goddess of Athens her influence had spread, even if her Knossian title should be translated "The Mistress of Athana." Only Zeus, as a divinity associated with the sky, has ever had an unquestioned claim to an Indo-European origin. Forms found on the tablets rule out attempted etymologies for Hera and Hermes. Like other Indo- European speakers, the Greeks must have developed or borrowed their gods - or at least their gods' names - after they became a separate people. Minoan Crete and the pre-Greek peoples of the mainland are likely sources, though of course every inexplicable name does not mean an Aegean deity. Besides adopting gods'' names the Greeks may have translated a number of titles into their own language: "The Mistress" (Potnia), "The Master" (Despotas), who was probably much less important (later the Arcadian goddess Despoina had a cognate title), "The Thrice-mighty Lord" (Triseros), "The Di- vine Mother" ( Mater theia, if she is not rather "The Godlike Mother," an honorific title for some royal dowager), "All the Gods" ( Parties theoi), a group of gods worshiped together at various shrines in and around Knossos, and "The Augur" ( Qerasijas , a form that could be ancestral to the name of the legendary seer Teiresias) who seems always to be associated with them. "The Priestess of the Winds" at three different sites in the Knossos area is likely to have officiated in a cult al- ready established when the Greeks came to Crete. It is tempting to try to see through the religion of the Mycenaean Greeks to the still more obscure pre-Greek Aegean cults. To judge from Cretan art, the dominant concept of deity was female, though we should also al- low for the possibility of less anthropomorphic, more universal, aniconic concepts of male deity - one would never guess, for example, the virtual identity of Zeus and the os, "God," in important areas of Greek religion if one had only the clay figurines of popular cult to go by, for the vast majority of them are female. But was there one great goddess or many, local, lesser goddesses ? The tablets suggest at least as great variety as in Classical 37</page><page sequence="6">6.

Photograph by Alison Frantz. Religion continued times, and many divine names probably escape detection because we have never seen them before. At first sight the frequency of the term Potnia ("The Mistress") might seem to support the theory of a great goddess. On examination we see two chief uses of the name: (1) preceded by a qualifying word (a genitive or adjective), as Da-pu2-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja , "The Mistress of the Lab- yrinth (?)" at Knossos, or Ne-wo-pe-o po-ti-ni-ja, the "Mistress of Ne-wo-pe-o(i) a place in the region of Pylos, and (2) at Pylos (there is no sure example at Knossos) without any qualification, most clearly in our text Tn3l6, above. She is there "The Mistress" at the place Pa-ki-ja-na; in this paragraph alone the name of the shrine is not given. Other shrines are named after their gods; she is simply "The Mistress" of her place. And so these unqualified references to her name are probably comparable to the first class. Were there any chance of confusion (in non-Pylian records, for in- stance), she would be "The Mistress of Pa-ki-ja-na but for Pylians she is "The Mistress" par excellence. Ad- jectives meaning "attached to the Mistress" (po-ti-ni-ja- we-i-jo ) no doubt refer to the mistress of whatever place is involved. So instead of one great goddess we have rather mistresses of a number of establishments, one of which, thanks perhaps to its size and proximity to Pylos, seems to be much the most important. This pattern of many local goddesses, distinguished from each other primarily by their location, must have deep roots in the Aegean world, for it is essentially an immovable religion of particular places. The establishments themselves do not survive but the religious feeling continues in Classi- cal times, when for Athenians "The Goddess" was simply Athena, and for Argives Hera (and already at Pa-ki-ja-na "The Mistress's" slaves were simply "slaves of the god"). Although later a pan-Hellenic art and poetry standardized a pantheon with distinct personal- ities and attributes, it is often not easy to tell one local goddess from another. Divine and human are often hard to distinguish on the tablets. Sometimes the context shows that "The Mistress" of an establishment is divine; at other times, it must be admitted, she might as well be human. From a bookkeeper's point of view it made little difference whether an item went to (or came from) man or god; in either case it was income and outgo. In the accounts, gods constantly rub shoulders with priests, cult officials and others who, as far as one can tell, are laymen. The interpénétration of sacred and profane is characteristic of Mycenaean life. The masters of the palaces were in- timately involved in ritual and ceremony, as can be seen in the arrangements of the throne room at Pylos : a chan- nel for the flow of libations ran by the side of the setting for the royal throne (Figure 6) ; in frescoes on the wall behind the throne supernatural griffins protected the king (see page 56) ; before the throne was the great cere- monial hearth on which offerings and even animal sacri- fices were made; near the hearth was a stuccoed offering table on which were found quantities of small cups for libations (Figure 7). The king's hearth was the center of ritual and social life, as it continued to be later in 38</page><page sequence="7">8. Stuccoed altar in front of a small shrine in the palace at Pylos. Photograph by Lord William Taylour. different forms - as the indoor sacrificial altar of early temples or the city's public hearth in the town hall. Elsewhere in the palace, in an area that served for work- shops (perhaps for the royal cavalry) a stuccoed altar stands in the open air before what may have been a small shrine chamber (Figure 8). At Knossos, records kept in the palace show that honey and oil were supplied regu- larly (the latter, at least, monthly) to various shrines in and around Knossos. Tablets at Pylos record expendi- tures for entertainments or feasts that very probably in- volved sacrifice to the gods. Pylian oil is assigned now to men, now to gods. All in all, it is no wonder that men and gods are so inextricably entwined in Mycenaean bookkeeping. The other side of the picture is the temporal influence of the gods. They held land, slaves, craftsmen as well as priests and other officials who, in turn, held land and slaves; they received tribute most of which, no doubt, was at the disposal of the gods' functionaries. Their es- tablishments must have had considerable effect on the economy of the kingdoms. The most striking instance is the community of male and female "slaves of the god," approximately equal in number (something over twenty each), plus a priest and a priestess, all in the service of "The Mistress" of the sanctuary at Pa-kt-ja-na. It seems that at some time in the past land had been taken from the community as a whole and assigned to the personnel of the god's sanctuary. It may be that we owe our knowl- edge of this arrangement to a dispute that broke out over the nature of the priestess' holding. These elaborate religious establishments, with their specialized personnel and their various classes of cult officials, and the kingdoms' intricate, palace-centered or- ganization reveal a complex centralization of power that is closer to Minoan Crete and the great kingdoms of the ancient Near East than anything Greece was to know again for many centuries. With the fall of the palaces at the end of the Mycenaean period the system collapsed, and with it the religious structure which, as so often happens, mirrors the social. Out of the wreckage of My- cenaean glory the epic poets created an image of an heroic age that dazzled Greece ever afterwards; and out of the motley hierarchy of Mycenaean gods, a few well defined individuals emerged to serve in the cast of di- vine characters and to be illustrated in Greece's nascent art. The gods of poetry came to represent a pan-Hellenic pantheon to which most local, particular divinities were assimilated. But it was a process that was never complete. Epic poetry with its heroes and its gods was the flower of Greece's Mycenaean heritage. The more intimate gods of local cult, as well as the needs and the ways of thought they reflected, were its root and stock.
