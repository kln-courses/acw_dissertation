<plain_text><page sequence="1">Current and Forthcoming Exhibitions The exhibition of sculpture, paintings and drawings by the Swiss artist, Alberto Giacometti, which has been organized by the Arts Council, will remain open until 9th July. It is to be welcomed as the artist's first one-man show in England and as one of the most comprehensive yet held in any country. The earliest work on view, Head of a Boy, c.I917-18 (No. i) already hints at the artist's rare sensibility, and not the least important of Giacometti's gifts is an ability to caress his material so as to produce the subtlest nuances of form. Rather than make a positive statement, however, he prefers to evoke and suggest an image which, in turn, will stimulate the mind to complete or perhaps more exactly to amplify it. His sculptures are even more dependent upon careful lighting to emphasize and clarify their volumes than most, and yet in his most recent work he presents little beyond the bare framework of the human figure. It is startling to contrast the Tate Gallery's almost life-size Pointing Man, 1947 (No. 14) with an actual human figure standing alongside the statue, a comparison now made possible by ex- hibiting the work off its plinth in the paved garden courtyard of 4 St James's Square. Giacometti has admitted his artistic aim to be the perpetuation of the transient, and to a certain extent he has attempted to translate into sculptural terms ideas first put forward by the Impressionist painters. But this is not all, for he also strives to capture the mood or sensation experienced at the sight of an object. The point perhaps becomes clearer when one com- pares The Square, I948-9 (No. I7) with Seven Figures and a Head (The Forest), 1950 (No. 2 I). In the former, the sculptor has observed a group of figures crossing a square from different directions, he has noted that often in brilliant sunshine the outlines of an object (especially the human figure in movement) are blurred, leaving only an ever-varying silhouette of the rudimentary structure - an elongated skeleton in fact. The very title of the other work suggests the analogy uppermost in the artist's mind. Visitors to the exhibition will find the drawings and paintings easier to understand, if only because they are less exaggerated in style, yet in them also Giacometti attempts to resolve problems of space, contour and volume, and they provide a necessary key to his sculptures. Turning to the exhibition of 'American Primitive Art 1670-1954' (organized by the Smithsonian Insti- tute, Washington, D.C.), at theWhitechapelArt Gall- ery (until 3rdJuly), one is confronted by two types of painting. Although it is not always easy to make a sharp division between the two, yet it should be noted that many of the earlier artists represented here were artisan-craftsmen, whereas those of the more recent generations may properly be classed as 'Sunday painters'. The various 'limners' of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries earned part of their livelihood by painting, and it was by an accident of geography that they found themselves cut off from the more sophisticated European in- fluences and opportunities for formal training. Among these must be numbered the Freake Limner's portrait of Henry Gibbs, I670 (No. I). Winthrop Chandler is rightly classed as a painter of the transitional period, and it is interesting to recall that he and Ralph Earl (who was also a landscape and historical painter) were active at the same time as Gilbert Stuart, Singleton Copley, R.A., and Benjamin West, P.R.A. Many of the paintings have great charm and felicity, and a few of the artists were aware of the conventions of European por- traiture, such as the late eighteenth-century anony- mous painter of George Washington in the circle of his family (No.i i). The names of Edward Hicks the Quaker, of Anna Mary Robertson Moses ('Grand- ma Moses'), and John Kane may be familiar to some of the public already, and they are all represented by good examples. Hicks' The Peaceable Kingdom is one of a series of this subject, and it is amusing to see how anthropomorphic his creatures have become; the same is true of the cockerel in Gertrude Rogers' Summer Morning (No. 129). Generally speaking, the American folk artist has been interested and stimulated by man-made situa- tions and achievements. The emphasis is on domesticated nature rather than on the vast un- tamed tracts of the United States. One of the most macabre subjects is John Brown Going to His Hanging, 1942 (No.97) by the negro artist, Horace Pippin, and it strikes a different note from the prevailing optimistic gaiety of the exhibition. There is an interesting exhibition of paintings by Angelica Kauffmann, R.A., at the Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood, open until September. It is the first opportunity in recent years to see so large a collec- tion of her work, and in addition to twenty-eight paintings there are examples of engravings and ceramics executed after her designs. Although she is known primarily as a decorative and history painter, yet she appears at her best as a portraitist in this exhibition. The gem of the collection is un- doubtedly Angelica hesitating between the Arts of Music and Painting, probably 1796 (No.14), from Nostell Priory, a large and strongly composed picture. Among the earlier portraits is one of Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1767 (No.18), a competent piece showing the future P.R.A. in his studio, but its true quality can only be guessed at, since it is in a very dirty condition. Many of the decorative pieces, whether mythological or allegorical, are characterized by a mannered elegance and pretty sentimentality which often charms, such as the two pictures (Nos.8 and 9) of Beauty tempted by Love and Beauty yielding to Love. It was an excellent idea to stage a joint exhibition of the work of Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley as the Marlborough Gallery have done (open until I6th July). Sisley's work appears to evolve with tranquil, lyrical ease, and it now seems incredible that during their lifetime both Pissarro and Sisley should have been even less successful than most among the chief impressionist painters; although Pissarro's advanced political views were undoubted- ly responsible for estranging influential patrons. The earliest painting on show is Pissarro's La Maison du Pare Gallien, Pontoise, i866 (No. i), still very much in the style of Corot, with lush, heavy greens pre- dominant; but La Seine a Marly, 187I (No.4) marks a new stage in landscape painting. The colour is more brilliant, the brushwork broad yet precise, and the whole work sparkles with light. Pissarro's experiments in the pointillist technique although not entirely successful were not without their value, for enriched by the experience thus gained he could paint a work such as Kew Green, 1892 (No.I8). Monet's influence on Pissarro's style regains its hold in the glorious late Gelee blanche, Jardin des Tuileries, 1900oo (No.26), or again, in Sisley's Le pont de Moret, et les Moulins (effet de neige), I890 (No.5o). There are also two interesting late Pissarro interiors (Nos.22 and 25). While on the subject of impressionist paintings mention should also be made of two fine pictures on show at Gimpel Fils in their exhibition 'Collectors'ChoiceV'.They areMonet's La barque rose, c. I885 (No.20), and Sisley's Jardin Potager a Louven- ciennes, 1873 (No.26), Also in this very mixed show are four Degas drawings, a G6ricault pen and ink study of horses for the lithograph Adelphi Wharf, and Mintchine's Portrait of a poet (No.I8). Graham Sutherland has added another portrait (the fourth) to the series which began with the Somerset Maugham. The sitter this time is Arthur Jeffress, and the portrait can be seen along with other Sutherland paintings at Mr Jeffress' gallery until 9th July. The preliminary study (No.2) was painted at Venice in July 1954, and is of the head alone. In the final picture Mr Jeffress is shown seated in reverse on a metal garden chair, his legs and feet tucked in underneath it as he leans his arms and chin over the top of the chair back. It is a comfortable pose and makes an ingenious composi- tion; behind the figure hangs a gold figured crimson tapestry. The lower limbs are only sketchily worked in, and Sutherland has concentrated upon the head, shoulders, and hands, which are done in meticulous detail. Although the head lacks some of the sparkle and spontaneity of the study, it makes up for this by an impressive solidity and effective characterization. The rest of the exhibition is a brief survey of the painter's career since 1940, and is composed mostly of small paintings. There is an early Blast Furnace picture and the British Council have lent their Green Tree Form, I940 (No.22). Train Disaster, Trappes, 1944 (No.20) demonstrates Sutherland's gift for making even smashed railway engines look like fossilized remains, while Monkey, 1955 (No.6) and 234</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS Man Walking (No.9) show that the influence of Francis Bacon's style remains as strong as ever. A large retrospective exhibition of over eighty paintings and drawings by Ben Nicholson has opened at the Tate Gallery and will remain until 2nd August. This exhibition has toured Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Ziirich, and will have greatly enhanced the artist's reputation. Works dating from 1921 to 1954 have been included, but there are no paintings of 1911-20 (a few of which still survive) and the artist has not wished us to see his first painting, the Striped Jug of 191 i. This is a pity, for it would have made the exhibition truly retrospec- tive; as it is, we are presented with a view of Nicholson's style at the time when it is already more than half-formed in the Still Life, Villa Capriccio, Castagnola, 1921-22 (No.i). All the basic elements are here: the incisive draughtsmanship, the sharply defined areas of colour, and the pruning away of all inessential detail. Then comes an increased aware- ness of texture and atmosphere as in Pill Creek, Cornwall, 1928 (No.6), and the landscapes painted between 1947 and 1948 have a wonderful complexity of colour and texture, particularly Jan. 29-48 ( Towed- nack) (No.43). The exhibition reveals a development that is measured, logical, and inevitable. It is characteristic that Nicholson should have turned to Braque for inspiration (e.g. the two still lifes of 1933, Nos.I3 and i5), and yet have infused an austere discipline into his interpretation of Cubism, stamp- ing it with an inimitable individuality of style. The large white reliefs of 1935 so scrupulously designed, have played a necessary part in the tempering of this discipline, although now they no longer make the same appeal to us. Instead, one turns to the recent still lifes such as Nos.58 and 63, Sept. 6-53 (Aztec) and Feb. 28-54 (vertical seconds) for a more lyrical and colourful form of abstraction. The least satisfactory painting is perhaps No.47, where the lower third of the picture is empty and unresolved. The catalogue has been prepared most carefully, but the deliberate 'archaism' of typography is irritating and sometimes (in the actual entries) difficult to read. The new Lawrence Gowing Exhibition remains open at the Leicester Galleries until 7th July. His recent landscapes done in the South of France represent a new departure and combine most happily sturdiness of structure with vitality. The latter is apt to be absent from his rather self- consciously posed models. Roland, Browse and Delbanco have an exhibi- tion of drawings by Henry Moore (until mid July) which they have collected over the past two years or so, and which date from 1928 to 1950. It is good to be reminded of some of Moore's early work; especially interesting is the Studies of Woman and Child, I928 (No.37) with its close links to Mexican art, and the Portrait of Stephen Spender (No.30) with its curious double profile. There is also Two Shelter Sleepers, 1941 (No.25) which is a version (in chalk and wash only) of the better-known Pink and Green Sleepers, 1941. At the same gallery there is the first one-man show in England of work by Alexandre Garbell, a Russian domiciled in Paris since I928. He has been compared with Bonnard because of his talent as a colourist, although he carries his work to a greater degree of abstraction than the older artist. View of Dieppe, 1954 (No.8) and Beach at Le Triport, 1954 (No.I6) are perhaps the most accomplished things there. The Redfern had a show of 'Twenty-four Jewish Artists' last month, which was an occasion to display some fifty-five works of good professional standard and taste. There were also fifteen colour lithographs by Marc Chagall. In complete contrast, the same gallery also showed seventeen works by Victor Pasmore. The greater part consisted of elaborate combinations of wood, metal and plastic construc- tions or 'reliefs' which were capable of being repro- duced in limited editions. The de Stz'l movement still has adherents. A Brazilian artist, Antonio Bandeira, had his first London exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery (Crawford Street, w.I) last month. He has a typical Latin-American eye for brilliant, and sometimes strident, colour; his work is reminiscent of da Silva and of Klee: it is decorative and easily assimilated. The Polish artist and book illustrator, Katerina Wilczynski, showed the fruits of her travels in Greece, Italy, Spain, and London at the Hanover Gallery. Her delicate drawings are roman- tic evocations of the genius loci, whether it be Athens, Venice, or Trafalgar Square, and the result is more often a personification of a place rather than an accurate topographical record. D. L. A. F. A selection from the exhibition of works by James Tissot, which closed at the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield, on 26th June, will probably be shown through the Arts Council in several other centres during the summer. Of note were several surprising items from his earlier period prior to 1870, and some idea of his precocity can be gained from his In Church of 1854, done at the age of I8. An even more accomplished work is his Girl in Black of I86I, a sensitive and quietly satisfying study in the manner of Ingres, of whom little trace survives in his later work, except perhaps an abiding skill in the tasteful use of black offset by decorative textures of fabrics. One can see that Tissot arrived in England with a formidable professional ability. His picture Les Adieux (1871), if we care to look beyond its anecdotal quality, is an impressive and carefully wrought structure with sustained interest in its muted tones. Without doubt his best English work was produced at this time, including, as it does, such canvases as the Coming Aboard of 1873, and The Parting, 1872, which contains subtleties enough of painting though heavily overladen with incident. Even as late as 1876, in his Gallery ofH.M.S. Calcutta, he could still produce a highly original and well- integrated design with a warm and pleasant colour scheme. The rot, however, had set in and ironically it is in some of his most famous and popular works that he is seen at his lowest ebb. His ballrooms and salons have now little to commend them above the photo- graphs he came increasingly to rely on and which presumably helped to debase his talents. His atmospheres become sleepy, tricks of design borrowed from Japanese Art are repeated to a monotonous degree, and his colour tends to an anaemic quality until it flares forth again in the uncontrolled vulgarity of the early I88o's. That an artist who had sunk to such mediocrity could con- tinue to turn out sketches of great vivacity and charm is one of the pleasanter surprises of the exhibition, and his small panels portraying Mrs Newton in scenes of arrival or imminent departure, subjects to which the artist continued to turn with almost obsessional regularity, have a fluency and immediacy lacking in much of his earlier work. A number of etchings and drawings are also included, the latter being consistently good. The facts of Tissot's tragic later years in England are now known. Kathleen Newton finally died of tuberculosis in 1882, and Tissot returned to Paris. That his loss was a double one is well brought out by this exhibition. H. F. CONSTANTINE The exhibition Charles-Quint et son temps at Ghent, reviewed in the June issue, was to have closed at the end of June, but owing to the very considerable interest it has aroused, the exhibition has been extended until the end of July. The Scorel exhibi- tion at Utrecht, which promises to be extremely revealing, opens on 3oth July. An exhibition of works by Ren6 Princeteau, an animal-painter, particularly of horses, who made a decisive contri- bution to the formation of Toulouse-Lautrec, has been organized at Libourne (Gironde) and remains open until this month. From 19th June through 25th September there will be on view in the Boymans Museum, Rotter- dam, an important and extensive exhibition of Art Treasures from Private Collections in the Netherlands. There will be about 200oo paintings from the fifteenth to the end of the nineteenth centuries, among them works by Van Eyck, Geertgen tot SintJans, Gerard David, Jan Gossaert, Q. Matsys, P. Bruegel the Elder, A. Moro, H. Avercamp. A. Bosschaert, Jan Brueghel, Ad. Brouwer, Jan van de Cappelle, A. Cuyp, Jan van Goyen, Frans Hals, Jan van der Heyden, M. Hobbema, Ph. de Koninck, Gabridl Metsu, A. van Ostade, Rembrandt, Rubens, Jacob van Ruisdael, Salomon van Ruisdael, P. J. Saen- redam, Jan Steen, Gerard Terborch, Emanuel de Witte, Fr. Boucher, Guardi, Lancret, Pater, Boudin, Daumier, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Jongkind, Monet, Sisley. There will be, moreover, an in- teresting group of medieval sculptures and an important series of bronzes by masters such as Reinier van Thienen, Bertoldo di Giovanni, Andrea Riccio, Pierino da Vinci, Giovanni da Bologna, Alessandro Vittoria. The silversmiths, especially of the Netherlands during the seven- teenth century, will be represented by some of their masterpieces. The famous Delft earthenware from the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries will be represented by rare examples of the highest quality (Hoppesteyn, Frytom and 'black Delft'). It has been possible to organize this exhibition thanks to the very generous co-operation of almost every collection of importance in Holland. A fully documented catalogue with 256 reproductions will be published of this exhibition, the largest of its kind since the exhibition of 1938 in the Boymans Museum. An exhibition entitled Ingres et ses Mattres, de Roques a David will be held at the Mus6e Ingres at Montauban from 6th July to 21st August, after having been shown at Toulouse. The study of the relationships between these various artists has been chosen as the theme, and as an excuse for showing the public, besides a number of neo-classic compo- sitions, an admirable series of portraits, many of which are virtually unknown, and a large group of drawings. Among the most important exhibits are the portraits of Bartolini and Gilibert by Ingres.</page></plain_text>
