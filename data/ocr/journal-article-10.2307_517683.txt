<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARK LOVERIDGE. A History of Augustan Fable. Pp. xiv+280. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. ?40. In this study, Mark Loveridge seeks not only to bring together a large and varied body of material, from classical antiquity through to the later eighteenth century, but also to recuperate and indeed enact a lost, 'Augustan' way of reading fable. The difficulty of this project is only fully acknowledged in the closing pages, where he observes that the intellectual work required of readers of fable, who have to 'bring half the entertainment along with them', is uncongenial to readers from the early Romantic period onwards, 'where imaginative creation was characteristically imaged, as Cowper himself [one of the last practitioners of fable] began to image it, as a cross between solipsism and reverie, and as beyond the power of thought' (p. 261). It might have been helpful to have grappled with this problem earlier on, but Loveridge's procedure is habitually and, one has to assume, deliberately topsy-turvy. It is not until Chapter 4 that we are offered a survey of the genre's origins and transmissions. The introduction and Chapter 1 argue for the persistence of Augustan fable within later eighteenth-century fiction-as subversive, intellectual interruptions of the novel's sentimental trajectory-and might have made more sense as a conclusion to the study, since the reader by then would feel better placed to understand the significance of these fabular moments. The range Loveridge tackles is impressive: ancient Greek and Roman fable, biblical parable, medieval and Renaissance European fable, as well as full-blown 'Augustan' work by Ogilby, Dryden, Mandeville, Swift, and Gay. Works of 'high' literature, of middle- brow popularity, and of fringe eccentricity are nicely integrated. This range enables Loveridge to construct a 'poetics' of the genre, which operates transhistorically: 'the natural condition of literary fable is to exhibit a double capacity which both shatters and works with various dualisms of discourse and readership' (p. 39). This in turn allows for the operation of fable within any given historical or political context. The doubleness and paradox inherent in the genre make it ideally suited to an age of indirection, irony, and The Review olfEnglish Studies, New Series, Vol. 51, No. 201 (2000) C Oxford University Press 2000</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 129 controversy such as the English Augustan, and Loveridge's explication of Ogilby's 1651 Fables in this light is perhaps the strongest and most cohesive section of the study: although his claim that the Fables represent 'the defining work of the English interregnum' (p. 102) may be straining things a little, he is right to observe that 'the Civil Wars were fought over the English language and its transmission quite as much as for control of other sources of power, and Ogilby's "various languag'd Host" of different animals provides a running echo or motif of this arena of linguistic combativeness' (p. 103). The range and variety of Dryden's Fables are elegantly explored, and Loveridge argues convincingly that their exploration of the mind's versatile energies within spatial and historical contexts anticipates the absorption of fable into the novel. A History ofAugustan Fable is characterized by intricate close readings (often wittily done, sometimes impenetrable) set against a background commentary of gnomic generalizations which are occasionally mystifying. Take this, for instance: So the fable, as well as belonging to the dunghill world, belongs to those who would like to pick up and wear the Pearl, the Truth that comes with the social status of being able to read (fables). It is the paradox of pastoral, transferred consciously to the matter of reading. Only the blackest of slaves, the basest of Indians, would throw a precious, white, unreadable Pearl away, richer than all his tribe and proud of his own speech: but as his position as black slave now aligns him with Aesop, he may also be able to moralize on (read) this in his poignant self-reflexive epimythium. (p. 38) Arguing that fable in Augustan England was a coherent but idiosyncratic literary mode, Loveridge emphasizes its capacity to make mischief, to undermine, and to disorientate. He illustrates this tendency in relentless and intricate detail, enacting his own argument that it is difficult to demonstrate how English fable is a 'coherent mode' (p. 5) other than by enumerating examples and allowing a pattern to emerge. There are plenty of good jokes and witty aperCus, but the overall vision of the study is not always clear. Despite some interesting observations on the etymology of 'fable' and its frequent use before the nineteenth century for what we would call 'myth', the precise boundaries of the form and its relationship to other genres or sources-classical myth, classical or topical allusion, personification or anthropomorphism, and proverb-are not fully clarified. For example, discussion of the 'Choice of Hercules' labels the story (within one paragraph), as, variously, a fable, a mythical apologue, an episode, an exemplum, a figure, and an example. Similarly, the theoretical premisses of the study are somewhat confusing: the ambitious intersection of a poetics with a historical reading is generally successful, but is occasionally invaded by anecdotes of dubious relevance, as when the question of 'industrious zeal' in Gay's Fable 8 (1738) is described as 'ludicrously inappropriate to Gay's residence in Burlington Gardens' (p. 250); or we are inexplicably advised that 'As in Emma, though for different reasons, there are practically no metaphors in [Gulliver's] narrative' (pp. 214-15). A History of Augustan Fable certainly establishes that fable has adaptable and subversive energies: but so, surely, do many other genres at this time, which are equally significant and more accessible. Accessibility is an issue which Loveridge addresses, largely in fact to stress the importance of informed and wise ('Augustan') readers over sentimental and straightforward 'Victorian' (or indeed modern) readers. Augustan fable likes to work 'with, or between, imagined constituencies of readers who can and cannot read fables' (p. 25). It is unclear whether Loveridge's own imagined reader is inside or outside this club.
