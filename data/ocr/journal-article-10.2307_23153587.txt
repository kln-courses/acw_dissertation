<plain_text><page sequence="1">OUR POLITICAL SYMBOLS FRANK WEITENKAMPF* In our game of politics symbols or emblems have been found convenient and useful aids in stirring up popular emotions and enthusiasms and promoting ideals and party aims. A considerable number of such symbols have appeared in the course of our history. Some are so national in scope that they at times trenscended mere party expedi ency. Of these, some came early, and all served to tie our people more firmly together in the conception of a strong union with central authority, as well as in national pride. Thus served the flag ("flag cerulean, with orbs of night dap pled" wrote Walt Whitman), Brother Jonathan, Uncle Sam, Columbia, the American eagle. These conceptions further ed the idea of a united country and played their part in forming patriotic sentiment. Later, slogans such as "54-40 or fight" were coined to fix popular opinion and to make it clear that we were the biggest nation in all creation. There were many special symbols—preserved in cartoons, slogans and nicknames—brought about by the rise of some popular hero, the entrance of some special movement in political life, the need of politicians for some form of descriptive expression to catch public attention. Generally these ideas found pictorial form in cartoons. That brought the appeal to the eye, resulting in a sort of visual instruc tion to the power of which Boss William M. Tweed once paid feeling tribute when he was galled by the attacks of Thomas Nast. Pictures caught the public which might per haps not have been reached by discussion carried on at a * The most recently published production from the pen of Mr. Weiten kampf, retired Curator of Prints of the New York Public Library and an outstanding authority on the subject, is his Political Caricature in the United States in Separately Published Cartoons: An Annotated Listing, now appear ing serially in the Bulletin of the New York Public Library. Mr. Weiten kampf's last appearance in the pages of New York History was in July 1951. 371</page><page sequence="2">New York History higher level. Symbols were a godsend to the cartoonist intent on direct, summary expression. Even more so to the politic ian, who would find a laughable neckname for the opposi tion party or candidate more effective than a statement or analysis of principles; a slogan such as "Tippecanoe and Tyler too," used in the whooping log cabin and hard cider cam paign of 1840, more appealing than a forthright stand on slavery or other questions; or a picture of a full dinner pail in the 'nineties more cheering to the public than a frank discussion of economic or social conditions or the tariff. The point was to assure the voter that "Codlin's the friend, not Short." When a candidate was defeated, the other side gleefully sent him up "Salt River." Many of the symbols died out when the situation which called them forth no longer existed. Others had a longer life. Nicknames were useful in increasing the popularity of aspirants to office, or holding them up to ridicule. Andrew Jackson became "Old Hickory," Martin Van Buren "The Little Magician" and "the fox;" Zachary Taylor "Old Rough and Ready," Winfield Scott "Fuss and Feathers," Buchanan "Old Buck," Lincoln "The Rail Splitter" and "Old Abe," General McClellan "Little Mac," Blaine "The Plumed Knight" and "The Tattooed Man." Benjamin Harrison was pictured by Keppler in Puck as quite lost under the capa cious beaver hat of his grandfather W. H. Harrison, and Theodore Roosevelt was often caricatured as wielding the "Big Stick." Animals cut a notable figure in our array of emblems. Those most apt to come to mind are the familiar Democratic donkey, the Republican elephant and the Tammany Tiger. R. L. Duffus, in The New York Times of Nov. 27, 1932, traced the first two to Harper's Weekly, Nov. 7, 1874, where both appeared in a drawing by Nast. Probably the first in this symbolic menagerie was the'terrapin of the "Terrapin Policy," a name given by the opposition Federalists to the embargo enforced during Jefferson's administration. This was remembered at the time of the embargo of 1813, when 372</page><page sequence="3">Our Political Symbols Alexander Anderson, the wood engraver, personified the Act of that year by a monstrous turtle. It has seized a viola tor of the law, who yells "Oh! this cursed o-grab-me!" (em bargo spelled backwards). The repeal of the measure was marked by Anderson in another engraving, To the Grave go sham Protectors of Free Trade and Sailor's Rights, in which the terrapin's head has been cut off, apparently by Madison. In the caricature A New Map of the United States (1828) the Jacksonian party is symbolized by an alligator, while a tortoise stands for that of Adams. One is reminded of the phrase "half-horse-half-alligator" with which the brawl ing, bragging flatboatmen of the old Ohio Valley and the hunters of Kentucky described themselves in their rhapsodic and bombastic tirades, full of opulent metaphor. This sym bol of the Southwest, odd composite beast, is ridden by Henry Clay in E. W. Clay's cartoon The Great American Steeple Chase for 1844, in which Calhoun bestrides the "Nullification Coota Turtle." So were symbolized the oppos ing ideals and purposes of the West and the South in those days. The hybrid creature referred to confronts a much dis turbed politician in James Akin's An Unexpected Meeting of Old Friends (about 1831) and it turns up as late as 1852 in the comic paper Lantern, in "a portrait of a distinguished Mississippian, half horse, half alligator, with a touch of the snapping turtle." We are told that a song, "The Hunters of Kentucky," sung by an actor in New Orleans in 1827, cele brated the Battle of New Orleans as won by backwoodsmen and Kentuckians,—"every man was half a horse and half an alligator." (And, by the way, a query in American Notes and Queries as to the origin of the phrase brought no answer.) About 1846 "Tadpoles" was a name given to "pro gressive Democrats" of the Middle West. And in 1862 Cur rier &amp; Ives issued a lithograph, drawn by Ben Day, entitled Breaking that "Backbone." It shows Davis holding a dragon like personification of the South, the "Gyascutis," whose back McClellan, Halleck and Stanton are trying to break; Lincoln seems to have a more effective means in his "Eman 373</page><page sequence="4">New York History cipation Proclamation." However, as this monster apparently only made this one appearance, it hardly attained the status of a symbol. In this zoological parade all are topped by the American eagle, "bird of freedom," a lasting conception, not dependent on any temporary movement in politics, and which has fre quently appeared in cartoons when the moral superiority of the nation was to be stressed. When Jefferson, often a target for bitter attacks, was lampooned in The Providential Detection (about 1800), his alleged designs on the stability of the Republic are shown thwarted by the national bird. Since then the noble creature has repeatedly stood as a sym bol, second only to Uncle Sam, of all the best that the coun try means to us—or of what party expediency would desig nate as the best. Sometimes he and our Uncle were combined and we got an Uncle Sam with an eagle's head, or an eagle in the Uncle's garb. Sometimes, too, the bird became an expression of spread-eagleism, shrieking lustily. There is still more of the fauna of our political symbol ism. In the 'seventies and 'eighties the rise of corporate capi tal aroused attention, and fear of this growing power found pictorial expression. The caricaturists had "Monopoly" figure at various times as a python, a hydra, an octopus, a hog, and once, at least (1882) as a vulture tearing the life out of the "Modern Prometheus" Uncle Sam. Then the conception began to take on anthropomorphic form. Kep pler (1889) used huge moneybags with human heads; Homer Davenport saw the "Interests" as an uncouth giant with bulging muscles and a small head, a sort of prehistoric mon ster. Finally the idea settled down to the figure of a corpu lent elderly gentleman with side-whiskers and a somewhat camouflaged malevolence. In F. B. Opper's series "An Alpha bet of Joyous Trusts" an air of rather brutal geniality gave the figure a humorous turn that partly hid the underlying bitter irony. A be-sidewhiskered old gentleman, with a capitalistic suggestion, and with an air of senility, was used by Rollin Kirby to represent the G.O.P., a type of the stand 374</page><page sequence="5">Columbia Upbraiding Uncle Sam.

And at one time the Democratic Party was frequently pictured as an Irishman with chin whiskers of the "Galway" kind. That was in the days when some one characterized the Republi can Party as the "party of organized greed" and the Demo cratic Party as that of "organized ignorance." Connected with the matter of trusts and monopoly was the figure of the immensely overgrown tot, the "Infant Industries," effective in pictorial arguments against the high tariff. Labor, in the 'eighties and 'nineties, appeared regularly in the guise of a stern, wise-looking, middle-aged man, usually with heavy chin whiskers without mustache, and generally wearing the square paper cap once used by workmen. Symbols change with changing customs; where do you see the paper cap today, in reality or among the cartoonist's devices? As to Anarchism and Socialism in those days, there seems to have been some fumbling in the search for an adequate symbol. While the conflicting claims of capital and labor thus found symbolical expression in cartoons, the demands of the West—the activities of the Grange, the movement for juster railway rates, and other operations against the "citadels of finance"—began to be "viewed with alarm." Populism ("Popocracy") and Free Silver were violently attacked in the comic press of both parties. Ridicule personified this western rural movement in figures related to the familiar caricature of the countryman, the "rube" or "hick," with long chin whiskers and an air of mingled shrewdness and vacuity. Senator Peffer's super-long beard lent itself well to this kind of derogatory symbolism. After various ideas of the Populists had found their way into the statute books, the use of such devices waned, and those Western agitators seem far off today. The times of this urge toward change in legis lation dealing with railway rates and other matters which the farmers considered harmful to their interests, brought also the greenback movement. Nast in the 'seventies lam pooned that in the form of a rag baby, for instance in Har per's Weekly for Aug. 26, 1876 and March 16, 1878. Antag onism, or at most lukewarmness, toward such early attempts 375</page><page sequence="8">New York History at social and economic betterment were apt to result in sym bols which did not bring out the real intentions and prin ciples of those striving for change. The question of temperance and prohibition has come up at various times for over a century. An early temperance cartoon, The March of Death (1820), pictured the liquor traffic as a skeleton with various articles connected with the manufacture and serving of strong drink. That symbol did not come into use. But when Louis Maurer, in The Great Republican Reform Party (1856), introduced as one of the supporters of Presidential candidate Frémont a stern-visaged opponent of tobacco, animal food and beer, he applied the conception of a glum-faced fanatical reformer, which had already occurred, to the definite picturing of a supporter of the Maine Law. In our days there has developed the symbol of enforced abstinence in the form of a tall gaunt man, dis reputable, red-nosed, hypocritical, in long frockcoat and bat tered high hat. Probably its earliest appearance was in Joseph Keppler's "member of a temperance society" (Die Vehme, St. Louis, Sep. 19, 1869). The same artist, after having in 1886 used a stern, be-spectacled female to represent pro hibtion, returned in 1889 to his original idea and evolved a striking figure. Later, Kirby in particular, and also Fitz patrick and others impressed this conception by frequent reiteration on public consciousness. A. B. Maurice wrote about this in his How They Draw Prohibition (1930). Carpet-bag government in the South during the Recon struction period after the Civil War, brought the term "Bloody Shirt" as a symbol of irreconcilability. In a cartoon in Puck 1876, Blaine and Evarts are trying to force this garment on an unwilling Hayes. When Hayes became Presi dent he withdrew Federal troops from the South, and in 1880 J. A. Wales showed him plowing under the "Bloody Shirt." However, it made sporadic appearances for some time after that, for example during the Cleveland-Blaine cam paign of 1884. In that Presidential contest came the "Mug wump," the independent voter, that uncertain element in 376</page><page sequence="9">Our Political Symbols elections, whose importance C. A. Beard has stressed. In 1882 Puck had already offered the figure of a fine-looking, stalwart young man, with red shirt and high boots, wielding an axe, to represent this vote on the fence. When this famous comic weekly was supporting Cleveland in 1884 this pic turesquely effective figure frequently appeared in its pages, in one cartoon undergoing a blood transfusion for the bene fit of old Democracy, the latter, with the "Galways" already referred to. Columbia made a fairly early appearance in our carica ture record, but in the last thirty years of the century there was an outbreak of female figures to represent various con ceptions: Liberty, Public Opinion, Justice, Vigilance, Peace, Law, Credit, the Republic, The Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the North, the South, New York, and what not. Always the same beauteous, stately female in flow ing classic garb, often with a coronet inscribed with the name of the idea represented. Columbia was similarly at tired, and save for details such as stars and stripes on her garment or perhaps a shield or a Phrygian cap, differed from the others hardly more than they differed from each other. The only essential change was in the label. Today this con geries of adaptable femininity has pretty well passed into oblivion. Symbolism has taken on a realistic, everyday form. Public Opinion, for instance, is now represented by a some what bewildered, be-spectacled little man who stands for "the public" or "you and me." As for Columbia, she, like Uncle Sam, gradually develop ed into a set form, with occasional deviations. During the War of 1812 William Charles etched his Bruin becomes Mediator, or Negotiations for Peace. In this Britain and Russia appear as the familiar lion and bear, and the United States as a female with the America flag and a pole topped by a Phrygian cap, the "liberty cap." In later cartoons, too, she occasionally took Uncle Sam's place as the national sym bol; sometimes the two appeared together. Keppler and Nast at times presented the two in married relation, Nast 377</page><page sequence="10">New York History once showing her as laying down the law to the Uncle in the matter of irregularities at Washington. There were ex ceptions to her usual appearance, as when Keppler occas ionally clad her in contemporary dress, or when Matt Mor gan drew her with legs partly bared, with a suggestion of Lydia Thompson's stage dress recalling the Black Crook. But generally, from the 'seventies on, she bore the classic costume that was long to remain familiar. The one symbolic figure that has steadfastly persisted and is likely to continue doing so is the one to which we all swear allegiance, and which, naturally, both our major political parties claim as their own—for the purposes of the particular argument—Uncle Sam. He grew from Brother Jonathan, that lanky somewhat rural, shrewd Yankee who may be traced to Yankee Doodle. In the early 'seventies, as told in Antiques for July 1944, Uncle Sam finally took on his present aspect. Old-fashioned as to dress, in swallowtail coat, with tall beaver hat and chin whiskers, he applies good old moral principles to modern problems, and has held his own with a dignity that makes him lovable. Columbia seems to have ι always remained a symbol, while Uncle Sam grew into a living figure based on traditional racial characteristics. In foreign caricature he is not infrequently a comic figure standing for cunning and greed. To us he is the recognized model for national thought and action, representing our country at its best in intention and endeavor. 378</page></plain_text>
