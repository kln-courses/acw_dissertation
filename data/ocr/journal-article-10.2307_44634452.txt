Spencer Martin Marietta Thomas Depkovich Denver Aerospace ABSTRACT The re-emergence of interest in onorbit satellite servicing is evident by the increased relevant activities by potential space users. This new interest could be attributed to the explosion in all robotics technology areas or the increases in overall space program costs. Either is substantial in itself but may provide a synergistic benefit when considered together. This paper presents a new look at an old subject with a prime objective of using emerging state- of-the-art technology to hold down program cost projections. Program constraints include using current state-of-the-art and telepresence con- trol from a ground control station with minimum implementation of automation. The space system proposed for this application consisted of a Remote Orbital Servicing System (ROSS) with man- ipulator arms, viewing cameras, and a replacement module stowage rack; and a ground control station with stereo viewing and two 6-degree-of-f reedom (6-DOF) hand controllers. INTRODUCTION Current interest in onorbit spacecraft ser- vices has provided a considerable increase in activity in related technology areas. These technologies are the same ones now going through an explosive emergence for application to robots and automation. Benefits of applying this tech- nology to onorbit spacecraft servicing are docu- mented in other studies. One of the major trade- off areas is the efficient envolvement of humans in the overall servicing process. Present ser- vicing projections require that it be done in close proximity to the Shuttle, using either the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) or by man in the extravehicular activity (EVA) mode. This con- straint restricts spacecraft services to the Shuttle orbital capabilities. Spacecraft requir- ing orbit modification capabilities need an inte- gral orbital maneuvering system (OMS) or an orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) to retrieve it to the Shuttle for servicing and then return it to its operational orbit. Considering the tremen- dous versatility of humans, it will be a few years before intelligent machines displace them. However, by using a human at a ground control station and sending a small remote-controlled servicing vehicle out to a disabled spacecraft, it could serve as a very cost-efficient contin- gency mode. A new concept capable of performing this type of mission has been proposed. This paper presents the proposed conceptual design of a Remote Orbital Servicing System (ROSS) that uses the STS capabilities. The ROSS concept investigated consists of two major elements - a Servicer Kit and a Ground Control Station. An artist's concept of the servicer kit is shown in Figure 1.

The capa- bility of the human operator to make decisions and perform tasks from a remote location pro- vides considerable advantages. Many of which can be resolved as either cost savings or crew safety. The human-in-the-loop control mode is a key element in this concept. Their flexibility in interfacing with machines provides a wide range in useful work performance through the capability to control mechanical devices equipped with sensory feedback. The availability and sophistication of sensory feedback, along with the command change capability inherent with the human operator, allows for the reduction of systematic errors in actual task performance. In other words, the human in the loop, or tele- presence, does not necessarily limit performance of a mechanical system that is soft or lacks rigidity. In contrast, autonomous systems are usually victims of equipment operational accu- racy in that position errors tend to be cumula- tive. This cumulative error can be corrected by the human operator in the telepresence concept and usually results in accomplishing difficult space activities with simpler and more reliable equipment as opposed to a totally-autonomous system. A totalljr-autonomous system to accom- plish the wide range of space operational tasks envisioned for existing spacecraft is currently and for the foreseeable future, beyond the state of the art. The concept most often recommended as a cost-effective approach is one that ini- tially designs for the human in the loop with growth capability to incorporate autonomous fea- tures over a logical period of time. This in effect sets an evolutionary goal to reduce the human workload and increase productivity through an elevation of operator involvement into a more- supervisory control mode. A key technology area associated with this concept is the communica- tions link required to send command signals from the control station to the space machine and return sensed data back to the control station. The control center thus provides the physical interface between the human and the orbiting machine. The communications link may be direct via STDN or through relay satellites via TDRS. The remote machine, carried to orbit by the Shuttle as a free-flying element, would be cap- able of transferring to different orbits from that of the Shuttle. For increased utility, the spacecraft could either remain in orbit or return to the Shuttle after performing the required orbital operations. The study resulting from the basic idea of telepresence investigated the adaptability of a free-flying remote orbital servicing system (ROSS), being able to match servicing activities similar to those provided by an astronaut in an EVA mode. This seems more reasonable if one realizes the limitations on motion for an astro- naut performing EVA. To represent servicing activities, three existing spacecraft were spec- ified and assessed for serviceability with the intent of providing the design rationale for a general-purpose servicer concept. Results from three prior ef forts^» 3) that were particularly applicable to the current ROSS system concept are shown in Figure 2. Each of these efforts was performed by Martin Marietta under contract to NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center during the 1970s. Simulations, mockups, and prototype hardware developed as part of these studies significantly increase the confidence level in the major ROSS subsystems and in the overall feasibility of onorbit servicing. ROSS CONFIGURATION The ROSS concept consists of two major ele- ments: the flight hardware (servicer kit) and the ground hardware (control station) . Addi- tional support equipment required includes a launch vehicle, space carrier vehicle, communi- cations link, and ground support equipment. Fig. 2 ROSS related efforts 4601</page><page sequence="3">4602 R. A. SPENCER AND T. DEPKOVICH Guidelines The study guidelines applied to this effort are: 1) Use state-of-the-art technology; 2) The servicing system shall be capable of ser- vicing the Space Telescope, Solar Maximum Mission, and Long Duration Exposure Facility; 3) Extent of servicing shall be the same as a man in EVA or in the STS payload bay; 4) A government-furnished equipment (GFE) propulsion/navigation/ power module will pro- vide transportation and stabilization of the servicing system to the approximate area of the satellite; 5) Control of the combined maneuvering system and attached servicing kit shall be provided through ground control with manned inter- action. The overall emphasis was on developing a feasible remote orbital servicing system con- trolled from a ground station using state-of-the- art technology. Three serviceable vehicles rep- resenting various modes of maintaining existing spacecraft designs were specified. The specific objective was to conceptualize a single servicer design that would be compatible with these three specified spacecraft and possi- bly many more. This required that the selected configuration use current technology and be cost effective in terms of orbital operations and minimum modification to the spacecraft. Spacecraft Serviceability Features The three spacecraft specified for the ser- vice missions model are shown in Figure 3. Each of the three is the responsiblity of a different NASA center - Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) , GSFC; Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) , LaRC; Space Telescope (ST), MSFC- and each reflects a different aspect of servicing requirements. Combined, the model represents an overall broader range for servicing activities than that afforded by any single spacecraft. The combination of the three models expands the servicing requirements of ROSS. At the same time, the number of modules, the sizes, the weights, and the attachment mechanisms impact the ROSS design. The SMM spacecraft is expected to be ser- viced by the orbit er/EVA several years prior to ROSS flight availability. The spacecraft is composed of an instrument module mated to the Multimission Modular Spacecraft (MMS). An RMS grapple fixture is attached to the MMS portion; however, the Shuttle RMS can only dock to MMS if the solar panels are jettisoned. In the event the solar panels are left intact, NASA has been developing a special grapple tool to attach to the trunnion pins on the transition adapter. Manned servicing plans include the primary objec- tive of replacing the MMS attitude control sys- tem module and, secondarily, three repair activ- ities to eliminate anomalies on the instrument module. For ROSS study purposes, the servicing requirements were restricted to the replacement of any of the three standard MMS modules, since the MMS is representative of a generic- type vehicle intended for a variety of missions. The MMS is typical of a small spacecraft which has been designed for onorbit serviceability and would be a prime candidate for future servicing using ROSS.^ Servicer System Configuration Some of the key questions in the area of system configuration are the basic control mode (manned or autonomous) and the distribution of computer resources between the servicer kit and the ground control station. There are several tradeoffs involved in determining an optimal configuration. These include cost, performance capability, flexibility for system alterations, and reliability. The state-of-the-art in manipulator control has progressed to the point that both autonomous and man- in- the- loop satellite servicing are feas- ible. The benefits and limitations of each mode are described below. The benefit of man-in- the-loop control lies in the simplicity of the required system. The simplicity stems from the fact that the human operator represents a powerful combination of mass storage and error correction capability. Because of this, the manned system has a minimal storage requirement and can tolerate misalign- ments in servicer craft/satellite orientation. An obvious drawback to the telepresence approach is the large time delay that is expected in ground control station/servicer kit loop (1-2 sec.). The impact of time delay could increase the time for an average operation by a factor of 6:1. The manned approach requires very little in the way of servicer kit computational capa- bility. Processor requirements consist of joint stability processors and an "executive" pro- cessor that acts as a communication interface and status monitor. These are minimal functions; another might include an auxiliary system for active compliance control in lieu of force feed- back through the ground control station. A totally-autonomous system would require a substantial increase in computational support over a manned system. The full requirements are not well defined but would include a large data base of spacecraft data and an advanced task planning/intelligent capability. This alone forces at least part of the system to be located on the ground due to memory requirements ( 10CK). The time delay problem is not as severe as in the manned case since entire paths could be generated off-line and transmitted to the servicer kit. An additional drawback to autonomy is the need for more precise position- ing of the servicer craft and satellite. This can be handled in two general ways - a more pre-</page><page sequence="4">SATELLITE SERVICING 4603 Fig. 3 ROSS S/C mission models cise mechanical docking mechanism or additional intelligence to determine the orientation using vision, laser ranging, or other position and attitude sensors. In either case, the result is increased system cost. Probably the most signif- icant drawback to full scale autonomy is the fact that not all contingencies can be planned for.* Configuration Driving Rationale The ROSS configuration driving rationale developed from the spacecraft serviceability assessment are: o Manipulators - Match EVA Capability-- Anthropomorphic Features - Number of Arms - Two, Distributed Actuators, 6-DOF System - Length and Joint Motion - Function of Kinematic Analysis o Module Stowage Rack - Module Rack Depth - X-Large ST Module - Module Rack Diameter - Orbi ter Bay Diameter o Viewing /Lighting - Mount Stereo Cameras to Simulate a Normal Head Position - Provide Camera Positioning Devices for Servicing and Docking o Docking System - Baseline System Provided by Carrier Vehicle with Minimum Modifications Due to Servicing Function o Carrier Vehicle/Servicer Interface - Attach to Forward End of Carrier with MMS Adapter Ring - Communications from Servicer Kit Through Carrier Vehicle to Ground Control Station o Ground Control Station - Baseline Communication to Ground vis TDRSS - Configure Station for Man-in-the-Loop Control The key elements of this rationale are driven by the spacecraft models, the requirements to match the manned EVA capability, the carrier vehicle, and the ground control station. Servicer Kit The servicer kit (Figure 4) would be attached to a carrier vehicle by means of a standard multimi ssion modular spacecraft (MMS) adapter ring. Basic flight support services, where prac-</page><page sequence="5">4604 R. A. SPENCER AND T. DEPKOVICH Fig. 4 Servicer kit tical, are provided through this connection by the carrier vehicle. The three main subsystems making up the servicer kit vehicle include man- ipulator arms assembly, video assembly, and module stowage rack. The docking probe shown on the forward surface of the servicer kit provides the mechanical attachment for the spacecraft being serviced. This probe is considered to be part of the carrier vehicle and has access through the servicer kit struc- ture. However, a few unique probe requirements follow from the servicer requirements. One most critical is that the probe have a telescoping capability of 2.4 m (8 ft.), which is dictated by the clearance required between the servicer and spacecraft for handling and orienting the replacement modules. Specific descriptions of the main subsystems are presented in the follow- ing paragraphs.5 Manipulators - A dual manipulator arm configura- tion was selected. The manipulator arms (Figure 5) are mounted on a T- section 360 rotating Fig. 5 Manipulator arms carriage which significantly increases the over- all reach envelope. Each arm has six degrees of freedom; shoulder pitch and yaw; elbow yaw; and wrist roll, pitch, and yaw. Each arm section is 1.22 m (4 ft) in length, measured between drive axes, or 2.44 m (8 ft) overall from the shoulder yaw to wrist yaw axes. The joint ordering and arm lengths were established by a kinematic analysis, which also considered the docking probe length, of the servicing required on the three model spacecraft. The end effector adds about 0.36 m (15 in.) to the arm length. Both the drives and arm segments are modular to facilitate changes in lengths, drive sizes, torques, and order. Each joint has a fail- safe brake which is nor- mally off when power is on and vice versa. The automatic braking function can be overridden by ground command. Manipulator drive sizing for 6.8-kg (15 lb.) tip force is shown in Table 1. The torques are based on attaining the accelera- tions shown; stall torques are approximately twice those indicated.

One, shown in Figure 6, from the IOS S study (1) . The power takeoff is used to drive special tools designed to fit the end effector grasp . If the same end effector is intended for general-purpose use, care must be taken in the design to preclude interference from the power takeoff and tool alignment cone when grasping other objects. Video System - A visual system, analogous to man's eyes, is an obvious requirement for remote servicing and inspections. Even as future ser- vicing systems evolve toward automated activi- ties, slight variations in the initial relative orientation between the servicer and the space- craft being serviced could require visual aids to establish a reference orientation prior to initiating automated servicing. Considering the current state of the art, a video system is the only viable candidate for the vis- ual system. The system considered here is black and white, since no specific requirement for color was identified. The system is a combined</page><page sequence="6">SATELLITE SERVICING 4605 Fig. 6 Wrist roll interface mechanism stereo/monocular system. Stereo is primarily a display aid allowing absolute and relative judg- ments of depth, a significant factor for the ground operator. This significance has been sub- stantiated by previous studies involving simula- tions that concluded stereo minimized basic depth alignment errors and allowed smoother, faster operations that two separate monocular views. Stereo was also easier to use and provided a higher level of confidence for the operator (3). The cameras selected are charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays. The CCD camera offers certain advantages over other types of cameras for this application. It is not subject to permanent damage if inadvertently pointed toward the sun and does not utilize a scanning beam with the attendant long sensor tube and high voltage. Thus, the sensor with the lens and preamp are separable from the electronics and form a small, compact video sensor for inclusion on the man- ipulator arms near the end effectors. This allows viewing in areas inaccessible to the other cameras while maintaining common electronics. The CCD sensor readout is digitally controlled. Combined with the geometric accuracy of the sensor structure, this allows the signal output from each photoelement to be precisely identified for use in the ground-based computerized image processing system. This also allows readout of a subarray of the full CCD array to facilitate scene sizing (field of view) as a function of resolution and bandwidth. The video downlink is digital rather than analog for compatibility with available Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) channels. Four-bit quantization of each pixel provides 16 gray levels with a resolution of 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) minimum. The frame rates, resolution, field-of- view, and bandwidth are all interrelated. A question concerning acceptable frame rates for stereo must be answered before the bandwidth can be specified. Work area scenes that contain the manipulator's end effector will often have trans- lational and rotational motion imbedded in the scene. While flicker caused by frame rates less then 30 per second can be eliminated by a scan converter on the ground, motion in the scene will appear as a rapid series of discrete steps if frame rates are too low. The point at which this j erki nes s in the scene will cause the ground operator to lose the eye-brain stereo accommoda- tion is not currently known but will be resolved in a future simulation effort. The camera locations on the servicer are shown in Figure 7. The basic system consists of the stereo pair (cameras 1 and 2) and a peripheral camera (No. 3). Cameras 4, 5, and 6 are mission dependent options. All cameras except those on the end effectors are mounted on pan/tilt mech- anisms and use zoom lenses. Each has an associ- ated small incandescent light which provides a good spectral match with CCD responsivity. The size of the EVA helmut-mounted CCD camera, which uses a 488 x 380 CCD array, is shown to illus- trate the compactness which can be achieved with CCD arrays. Stowage Rack - The stowage rack is the basic system structure as well as the holding fixture for modules to be exchanged during on-orbit ser- vicing. The design reflects on optimum tradeoff for stowage volume, weight, module accessibility, and a minimum Shuttle payload bay length require- ment. The 12-sided envelope is approximately 4.6 m (15 ft.) in diameter and 0.9 m (3 ft.) in length. The stowed video and manipulator assem- blies increase the overall envelope to only 1.1 m (44 in.) with the docking probe retracted. A variety of replacement modules must be accom- modated by the stowage rack. For just the three spacecraft models assessed, module weights ranged from 7.7 kg (17 lb.) to about 454 kg (1000 lb.) and module sizes of up to 0.91 x 0.91 x 2.2 m (36 x 36 x 87 in.). There is no reason to expect these modules to bound the requirements for all spacecraft. The mechanical attachment techniques used to mount the modules to the spacecraft are as diversified as the weights and sizes. There- fore, unless some degree of standardization is imposed in the near future on spacecraft modules intended for onorbit replacement, the following design criteria are suggested: a) A modular stowage structure, where the cross members and supports may be changed (shortened, for example) to accommodate modules too large to fit within the basic structure or separate module containers used within the structure for multiple smaller modules. b) In general, mounting the modules to the structure by the same technique used to</page><page sequence="7">4606 R. A. SPENCER AND T. DEPKOVICH Fig. 7 Number and locations of cameras mount them in their host spacecraft. By tailoring the stowage rack to fit specific missions, the servicer can usually carry a full complement of modules for most spacecraft. Although shown open, the rack requires covering for thermal control purposes. The servicer kit weight, excluding replacement modules, is esti- mated at about 386 kg (850 lb.). Ground Control Station After initial deployment checkout near the Orbit er, the carrier vehicle and servicer are under ground control until rendezvous for the return mission Or the system may be left in orbit, with replacement modules and expendables provided by the Orbit er on subsequent flights. The primary ground- servi cer communication link is via the TDRSS. The limited coverage of the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN) will restrict usage of that system, except as a backup to TDRSS, until a high level of automation is implemented. Then the STDN can provide a periodic monitoring function for the automated servicing. With either system, round trip uplink and downlink time delays can range between one and two seconds. The transmission time delays associated with the uplink and downlink communi- cations are shown in Figure 8. The most signifi- cant single contributor to the overall delay is the 4800-bit block formatting in NASCOM. The 1.0 second délay is the maximum specified in the NASCOM User's Handbook; the 0.25 seconds shown as the minimum is an approach developed by TMS. The command data would be shifted into the block format at a much higher rate than the nominal 1000 BPS transmission rate. The remainder of the block would be filled in a "burst" mode with filler bits. The feasibility of this approach and the hardware /software impact on NASCOM are not yet known. However, this delay is not expected to be a major problem. The ground control station includes two 6-DOF hand controllers, a monocular screen, and a fresnel stereo visual system. Controls are mounted in functional groupings bordering the display screens. CONCLUSIONS All current and previous studies have indi- cated the feasibility of remote orbital servicing and that it is within the state-of-the-art. For general-purpose servicing, designing service- ability into spacecraft is not considered a major cost or weight impact. Accessibility to the equipment, including locations and number of docking ports, use of captive retention hardware, module handling, and connector mating/demating are some of the obvious considerations. A feasible approach to onorbit servicing is one that combines full human-in-the-loop capa- bility with limited autonomy. A limited autono- mous function might be automation of movement to the approximate work area for a given task.</page><page sequence="8">SATELLITE SERVICING 4607 Fig. 8 Ground control roles It is not possible to accurately predict all future servicing requirements, although areas such as refueling and construction of large structures are prime candidates. Original ser- vicer designs should incorporate a high degree of flexibility and design margins such that future requirements can be accommodated with minimal system impact. Similarly, onorbit main- tainability and repair of the servicer indicates a modular design concept. Repair could be per- formed by the servicer itself or with EVA, using spare parts carried in the Shuttle payload bay. REFERENCES 1. DeRocher, Jr, W.
