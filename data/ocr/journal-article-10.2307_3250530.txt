<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTIBUS ASIAE LIII, 3/4 (I993), BOOK REVIEWS Damrong is his preface to an account of the three trips to Indonesia by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, I853- I9IO). It is reputed to throw new light on the acquisition oftheJavanese statuary that is now kept in the National Museum and in several temples in and around Bangkok. A translation of this travelogue, together with the extensive official Dutch correspondence concerning the trip of i896, would help to put the at one time quite controversial trip in its proper historical perspective, but it is difficult to imagine how it could provide the same level of insight as that gained from Prince Damrong's preciousJourney through Burma in 1936 His book has been occasionally utilized by western specialists (e.g. Jean Boisselier in the article referred to above), but the Diskul Foundation, established in Prince Damrong's memory in I979, the translator and the publisher River Books are all to be commended for having made this rich and interesting text, previously only accessible to readers of Thai, available to a wider public. Jan Fontein Carol Radcliffe Bolon, Forms of the GoddessLajjda Gaunr in Indian Art, The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, I992, xiii + 9Ipp., 52pls., 30o black-and- white photographs Forms of the Goddess Lajja GaurZ in Indian Art is a definite contribution to the understanding of a fascinating image in Indian art. It is a remarkable collection of basic data on the culture of Lajja Gauri. The study is objective, penetrating, sympathetic and at the same time critical in the true scholarly tradition. The author has brought to light a fundamental fact about the image that "though it shows the sex organ, it is not primarily erotic, but has a profound spiritual message couched within a seemingly erotic display." That certainly is the essence of this image. Having surveyed almost all the Laj j a Gauri images so far known, the author has done a signal service by classifying them into four broad categories. She has also focussed the attention of scholars on the fact that Lajja Gauri was important to the Early Chalukyas. The reference to the inscriptional material and the fact that the goddess was worshipped as Nandd is interesting. The discussion of the frog type is illuminating. The names of the sites where the images are found are associated with 'Ela' and Bolon rightly points to the association of place names with the grdmadevatd function. Thiripyitsaya Hotel at Pagan was being excavated. One of the most important parts of Prince Damrong's book is chapter 5 in which he provides detailed commentary on the remnants of the Mandalay Palace. He was, in all probability, one of the last knowledgeable visitors to this historic monument before it was completely destroyed during the Second World War, and his account offers valuable information not found anywhere else and describes buildings now irretrievably lost. One ofthe most surprising passages in this chapter deals with Prince Damrong's enquiries concerning the fate of the Burmese regalia. It is amazing how much disinformation was given to him about the dis- appearance of these precious objects, and he seems to have remained unaware of the fact that they had all been "requisitioned" as "indemnity" by the British at the end of the Third Burmese War and that they had all been held "in safekeeping" in the Victoria and Albert Museum since I886. They were returned to Burma in I964 and are now on display at the National Museum in Yangun. Most of the literature on Burma consists of books either written by westerners providing a European or American perspective or by Burmese who represent a native point of view. What makes Prince Damrong's account of such special interest is that these are the astute and sympathetic observations of a great scholar from a neighboring country, who managed to avoid the mistake Burmese scholars sometimes attribute to their Thai colleagues, i.e. that they - for obvious historical reasons - tend to emphasize the role of the Burmese as destroyers rather than that of bearers of a great ancient culture. Literature of this type, written by Asian scholars about other Asian countries, is relatively rare (in the field of Buddhist art Sivarama- murti's Le Stupa du Barabudur comes first to mind). Prince Damrong's book was ably translated by Kennon Breazeale in a smoothly flowing style which captures some of the urbane and civilized tone of the original. The translator and Dr. M.C. Subhadradis Diskul have added useful footnotes, explaining many of the details that are self-evident to educated Thai but obscure to ignorant foreigners like this reviewer. These notes also add up-to-date information in those instances where the situation described or the facts mentioned by Prince Damrong have been superseded by later events or discoveries. It is to be hoped that this publication will not be the last travel memoir of the Thai royal family to be translated. Among the many publications of Prince 494</page><page sequence="2">ARTIBUS ASIAE LIII, 3/4 (I993), BOOK REVIEWS Discussing the English names given to Laj ja Gauri, the author points out the misconceptions and erroneous translations of the functions and names of the goddess. She also agrees with the suggestion that "the ideas embodied in and the textual descriptions of Aditi seem to correspond to the appearance of the image of Lajja Gauri." When the Laj ja Gauri image at Darasuram was noticed by me, I suggested that it is a twelfth-century Chola image. Bolon has suggested it might be a Chalukyan work, brought to the distant site like other Chalukyan sculptures by the Cholas. However the possibility that it could still be a Chola piece is not ruled out. We have a few instances of Ganesa - in bronze cast by a South Indian craftsman but modelled on the Pala sculpture of Bengal, now in the Nagesvara temple, Kumbakonam. It was probably made for a portion of the people who hailed from the region where the cult was popular. In my article already cited, I have drawn attention to the Saurashtra, people of Darasuram, being specially devoted to the goddess. However, I will not assert that it is not Chalukyan, similar to the example now kept in the Alampur Museum, in the light of Bolon's description. Her rejection of the suggestion that the image was inspired by Roman prototypes is convincing. The following observations are not out of place in this connection. (I.) Bolon has noted my reference to Lalitd Sahasra Ndma and also the modern name of the goddess as Cakraraji (Cakrdyi), which she considers "possible but not incontrovertible" (p. 37, No. 85). When other lines of identification are not positively clear, one has to take recourse to local tradition. Bolon herself refers to the local names of villages like Ellama, Yellala Yellesvara, etc. After all what is the antiquity ofthese names? Here only the modern names are taken to drive home a concept. (2.) I.K. Sharma's reference (p. 29) to an image in the Kamakshi temple, Kanchipuram, as (a) Lajja Gauri, (b) pre-Chalukyan in date, and (c) the original image for worship in the Sakti pitha, is incorrect. Although that sculpture is badly worn, it is a Gajalaksmi, a Pallava image akin to those in Pallava monuments. The goddess is seated on a high lotus seat as in the Gajalaksmi sculpture at Mallapuram. She is not in spread-leg pose, one of the most important criteria for Lajja Gauri images (Bolon, p. 5), but both legs are pendant as at Mamallapuram. Her two hands are in the position of holding lotuses and by her sides are the remains of elephants proper for a Gajalaksmi image. She is seated and has a human face. One conversant with Gajalaksmi images will have no doubt about its identity. It has, however, a vertical cut from the face to the seat that obviously occurred in later times, which obscures the original identity of the image. It is locally called 'Argpa Laksmz' and was later built into the wall. To suggest that it is Lajja Gauri as Sharma did, to assign a pre-Chalukyan date to it, and to assert that it was the original image of worship is erroneous. Bolon has done well simply to quote Sharma with a note that the image has neither been illustrated nor described. (3.) The author's statement that "the nornmal birth pose in India is supine" (p. 6) is incorrect as there are sculptural and mural representations showing women giving birth while standing. (4.) It is suggested that perhaps Lajja Gauri was a grdmadevatd that got absorbed into Hindu pantheon (p. 48). There is no clear definition of the concept of grdmadevatdaoffered in the book. If the concept is similar to the Madhurdpurz devatd, Compdpati, or Kdnchzpuri devatd, then they are highly classical deities, identi- fied with Durga, Kali, Saptamatas, Jyesta, etc., who are generally called grdmadevatds, but deities codified in texts. If the ideas echoed in Vedic Srauta and Smdrta traditions "are given form in the image" (p. 6) then the concept of grdmadevatd does not hold good. This suggestion has not been properly explored or sustained. (5.) Bolon accepts that (a) the concept of Aditi must be considered to foster, philosophically, the idea of Laj ja Gauri (p. 65); (b) the name Gauri includes Parvati, Tripura, and Sri (p. 64); (c) the various forms used to represent the idea of Fortune - Sri, Srivatsa or Lajja Gauri - draw from one pool of forms (p. 58); (d) there seems to be a relationship in meaning as well as form of Lajja Gauri and Srivatsa, thereby kinship with Sri (p. 56); (e) the lotus symbolizes cosmic consciousness or the idea of perfect wisdom (p. 52), that is Vakdevi. All these concepts clearly demonstrate the truth behind the suggestion I have made (p. 37, fn. 85) that this image further evolved or merged with the figures of Mahddevi, MahdlaksJmi, and Mahd SarasvatZ, all being shown seated on a lotus, with elephants pouring water over their head. This image is further identified with Tripura as in Lalitdsahasranama. It is therefore not clear what points contravert my suggestion. Bolon has not pointed out any controvertible points beyond suggesting that "they are not incontrovertible." (6.) The Kesarigutta plaque (p. 45) is said to have been found under the base of an altar of a Siva temple, 495</page><page sequence="3">ARTIBUS ASIAE LIII, 3/4 (I993), BOOK REVIEWS a location that would suggest the form of the temple ritual directly rather than Vedic ritual. (7.) There seems to be aslip in 'the date ofassimilation of this culture into Saiva theme'. (a) "By the mid sixth century the early auspieces Uttanapad, 'pot-Goddess' in a new anthropomorphic form, seems to have become identified as a Sakti of Siva" (p. 40, contra see p. 48). "There is no doubt that at least by the fourth century Lajja Gauri had become accepted into the Hindu Pantheon as a Sakti of Siva." There is a gap of two centuries between these two dates. Perhaps it is a slip. (8.) That Kartikeya carries a trident in his hand is not irreconcilable (p. 46). It is in fact the earlier form of Sakti, and Kartikeya is Saktidhara. In the South Indian context two tridents, one inverted and joined, are called Sakti in later times. These are some of the questions that I would like to raise for purpose of clarity. But I must hasten to add that all my comments are peripheral in nature and this is a masterly treatise, the main thrust of which is unassailable. I am extremely happy to record that this book is absolutely scholarly and will remain a standard reference text on the subject. R. Nagaswamy Kirit Mankodi (with introductory remarks by Michel Postel), The Queen's Stepwell at Patan. Project for Indian Cultural Studies, III, Bombay, Ip99, 252 pp., site plan, Io + 26drawings, and 24 + 2II colour and black-and-white photographs. In ca. A.D. Io64, Queen Udayamati of the Solanki dynasty of Gujarat, in western India, ordered that a giant step-well be built near the great Sahasralifiga reservoir in Anahillapataka (Anhilwad-Patan) to memorialize the death of her husband Bhimadeva. During its construction, the scale of the project required structural compromises such as bolstering cross-bridges and buttressing walls, and within two centuries of its completion a great flood of its neighboring Sarasvati river had silted in this remarkable example of India's royal water-architecture. Of seven, only the upper three storeys of this "Ranki Vav" ("the Queen's Stepwell") remained visible above the silt and stagnant pond. These exposed portions, over the centuries, were subject both to incessant weathering as well as to plunder.I The many hundreds of sculptures of its lower four storeys, however, had been returned by nature to a watery grave within India's rich alluvial soil. There they remained safe even from the Islamic forces who took power in the region by ca. A.D. I3oo00. From this womb they only recently have been reborn - still remarkably intact - under the supervision of a team of excavators from the Archaeological Survey of India.2 Over the past decade, Mr. Michel Postel of Franco- Indian Research Pvt. Ltd., Bombay, has substantially promoted and encouraged scholarship on the art of India through a series of publications under the auspices of the "Project for Indian Cultural Studies." Two previous publications, on Antiquities of Hizmachal and Ear Ornaments of A ncient India, have preceded the present one. Each of these monographs has been lavishly produced at Bombay's leading art-printers, Vakil &amp; Sons, Ltd., using a large double-columned format with interspersed color and black-and-white plates. The entirety of each volume has been printed on art paper. No other scholarly monographs in India can compare with this high quality of production and few art books in the world exceed them in level of scholarly conviction. It is a credit to India that a project of such high seriousness has been so successfully initiated in the private sector. If Queen Udayamati's great act of patronage was forever memorialized by her enormous stepwell, so also has Mr. Postel's in this series of publications. A cosmology rooted in water has informed most monumental architecture in India, seeing the source of fertility and parturition first on earth rather than in the heavens. In so agriculturally oriented a world, it should be no surprise to us that the major structures were made that gave access to water or that, as "negative" architecture, these excavations were given a monu- mental frame. Tanks and wells have survived from a very early period in India and continued to be built - still as symbolic as much as functional monuments - after the coming of Islam to India. Perhaps the most famous and widely visited stepwells in the Ahmedabad area, in fact, were built under Islamic patronage.3 No other structure, however, can match the impact of Udayamati's stepwell at Patan. Its seven storeys were originally lined by over 500 images, making one's descent toward water an entry into the cosmos unequalled by any other Indian monument (and the flooding and reflooding cycles of water a cycle of cosmic birth and rebirth). The first stage of this descent was marked by images of the Regents of the Quarters and their consorts. A 496</page></plain_text>
