<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "KUO/KA," GUARDIAN SPIRITS OF FAMILY AND CLAN AMONG THE NGANASAN* A. A. POPOV (Translated by L. L. Sample) The numerous zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines of Siberian peoples so richly represent- ed in the collections of our museums are usually regarded as representations of spirits and dei- ties. But study of religious concepts among some Siberian tribes forces us to the conclusion that this is not always the case. The majority of these figurines are not representations of spirits and deities but of their containers. For example, there is a unique collection of Dolgan religious sculptures in the Museum of the Institute of Eth- nography of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. V. N. Vasil'ev assembled this collection, and in one of his published works 1 he describes them as images of spirits, which, however, falls short of the truth. Such erroneous interpretations of certain zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figur- ines are the result of mechanical carry-over from conceptions in religions standing at a higher evolutionary level, where, in fact, they could be representations of spirits and deities. Many Siberian peoples are not yet at this stage of development in religion. This holds even for the Yakut, among whom religion had reached a rather high level of development. We know that ideas concerning spirits and deities had evolved to such a degree among them that many of these things had taken on an entirely concrete form - only in thought, however, for the Yakut made no figurines. Some second-rank spirits, as for example the Eheke hunting spirit, may have formed an exception. In these cases, too, however, the question still remains open whether these figures were not actually containers of the spirits (or * spirit placings" - Ed.). The concepts we want to report on were widely diffused among the other Siberian tribes, specifi- cally among the Nentsy (Yurak Samoyed), Entsy (Yenesei Samoyed), Evenki (Tungus), northern Yakut, and Dolgan. We studied them far more in detail among the Dolgan than among the Nganasan, and we intend to treat them in a general work on the religion of the Dolgan. We decided to publish our far -from -complete Nganasan folklore, because it confirms the particular conclusions we reached in our studies of Dolgan folklore. For further confirmation, let us cite one ex- ample of Dolgan folklore about familial guardian spirits. What the Nganasan understand by the word kuoika is called haitaan among the Dolgan. Like the Nganasan, the Dolgan believed that you can settle a spirit in any object you want, for ex- ample, in an ordinary woman's cap. If you cause the cap to accept a good spirit, then it can become the haitaan (kuoika), i.e., the tutelary spirit of the family, and this common thing becomes a cult ob- ject. If, however, you transfer the spirit into an- other article -then the hat becomes an ordinary utilitarian object again. In this case, we have an ideal notion of the incorporeal nature of the spirits according to which they can be settled in a select- ed material object. The good spirits and deities of the Nganasan, on which the most important necessities of life not only of clans and families but of the whole tribe depend, are known by the category name nguo; the bad spirits bear the name barusi. Neither the one nor the other found any real embodiment in the form of any sort of figurine of wood, stone, metal or other material. In Nganasan spirit lore, also, the deities and spirits of higher rank did not al- ways take on a definite form. It was quite differ- ent, however, with the kuoika- the guardian spirits of the clan and family. These regularly had a material embodiment, occurring not only in the form of artificially produced zoomorphic and ♦Translation of A. A.

From this we may conclude that the Nganasan, by the name kuoika, meant any material embodiment whatever of the minor spirits which protected the members of a family or clan. In this sense (in the sense of the material embodiment of the spirit) the Nganasan gave the name kuoika to the orthodox ikons of the Russians. They called the little village of Kha- tanga, Kuoika Madu, i.e., kuoika dwelling or house, because there was a church there. The concept kuoika had a much broader mean- ing, however, for, by kuoika, they meant also just any natural object in which a spirit dwelt as master. Thus, for example, certain mountains and boulders or large stones were considered kuoika. In these cases the distinguishing feature for the presence of the host spirit was either its unusual strange outer shape or else some unusual event which had taken place in its neighborhood and was attributed to the influence of the host spirit of the kuoika concerned. In the middle reaches of the Logata River there is a lake. On its bank are two upright stones which are honored as kuoika. People were afraid to pass between these stones, since the in- dwelling spirit recognized "unclean" persons and brought them misfortune as punishment for the "defilement." When the Taimyr -Nganasan drove past these kuoika, they always offered reindeer to them as a sacrifice. Smaller objects, as well as those of wholly unusual appearance, became kuoika (i.e., dwelling places of the spirits) only in a certain circum- stance. They only accepted the spirit if it was lodged in them by the shaman. To make a kuoika out of an object, the shaman had to intervene and supplicate the spirit and master common to all kuoika to dispatch a special spirit. When a person found a rock or any other object of unusual shape, he would ask the shaman, *Can this thing become my kuoika?" If, because of a distinctive sign known only to him, the shaman gave a positive decision, a shamanistic seance would be held in order to let the spirit enter into the object and transform it into a kuoika. According to their origin, we can classify kuoika into natural ones not worked by the hand of man and artificial ones fashioned by man. Natural kuoika are, for the most part, stones of any unusual shape. The Vadeev- Nganasan venerated stone kuoika especially. They ex- plained this in the following manner. If a kuoika is made out of wood, then the spirit and master of wood demands, as recompense for the tree felled for the purpose, the death of a person from among the kin of the kuoika' s possessor. Because of this the Vadeev -Nganasan tried to obtain a stone kuoika which demanded no man's life. Among natural kuoika belonged objects such as the antlers of a wild reindeer with misshapen tines, an animal skin of unusual color, a branch of extraordinary shape and so forth. It is not necessary, however, to cite an exhaustive list of all natural objects which could become kuoika» Artificial kuoika were zoomorphic and anthropo- morphic figurines of various sizes fabricated out of wood, bone, or metal. Iron kuoika, which could display all imaginable shapes from animals to heavenly bodies, frequently served as metallic appendages to the shaman's costume. Usually the appendages were ones which dying shamans had bequeathed to relatives and housefellows for pro- tection against various diseases. Since the sha- manistic appendages had already held spirits during the life of the shaman, no special cere- monies were necessary for their settling in. There were universal and special kuoika ac- cording to their function. They turned to the first for help in the most various circumstances: in case of illness, in case of loss of reindeer, when it was a question of avenging oneself on an enemy and so forth. So in case of illness, for example, they would go into the road, knock lightly on the sled with the stock and say, * Since we have you, why are we sick? Help us." But the kuoika did not help unselfishly; they received presents for their help-glass beads and all kinds of little trinkets, and, in more serious cases, reindeer which were provided with special brands (Fig. 1). If the sick person got well, often the kuoika *ate up" the reindeer, which thus perished in lieu of the sick person. Urannik, a Nganasan, explained to us, * Recently when my wife got sick, I turned to my kuoika for help. My wife got well, but the next day a wolf killed a reindeer; the kuoika had de- voured it." Because the kuoika spirits commanded no very great power, they neglected to turn to them in cases of serious illness, because, possibly, they might not be able to help; the spirit of the serious illness, however, could become angered and aggra- vate the illness if one did not turn to it. To the special kuoika class belonged those which brought success in hunting and fishing, pro- tected the family, the home, and so forth. Among the anthropomorphic kuoika belong two male figur- ines carved from wood, which we gave to the Mu- seum of the Institute of Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Leningrad. One of the figures (a hunter) displays clear sexual</page><page sequence="3">124 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 characteristics. The figurines were supplied with iron and copper attachments, which were sup- posed to protect them from the attacks of bad spirits (Fig. 2, 3). After a successful hunt, the hunter "fed" the kuoika-- smeared them with blood or smoked them with the bone marrow of captured wild reindeer. If this was not done the kuoika felt slighted and there would be no game. "Dyutadie Nergo has caught nothing this year," the Nganasan told me, "it is his own fault, though. Before he went on the hunt he asked his kuoika to grant him good suc- cess in hunting. They fulfilled his wish and he killed two wild reindeer. Afterward, however, he failed to feed his kuoika, and since that time he has not been able to catch any more wild rein- deer." Hunting -kuoika were not always anthropomor- phic; the hide of a wild reindeer head with unusu- ally shaped antlers still attached was often a kuoika, also. Fishing -kuoika were made out of iron or wood in the shape of fish. Iron kuoika were kept in a whole undamaged fish skin cover. The two fishing kuoika we deposited in the Museum of the Institute of Ethnography in Leningrad are carved from wood and are 36 and 33 cm. in length respectively (Fig. 4a, b). They were kept in a pouch especially serving this purpose, 36 cm. long and 30 cm. wide, which was sewed up out of reindeer skin, the skin turned inside out. The pouch was rec- tangular and ornamented on one side with red ochre (Fig. 5). After success in fishing, they "fed" the kuoika -smeared them with fish blood and slime. In one version, fire -kuoika were fashioned in human form out of a forked branch, but in the other, out of the skin of a bear's head. Fire- kuoika were stowed in a little sled which was bound upon a large sled (Fig. 7). Some families possessed shaman kuoika in shaman costume. They turned to them to ask for divinitory dreams. The mistress-of-the-tent kuoika was made from a forked branch in the form of a two headed female figure2 clothed with a tiny woman's pelt which was sewed up specially out of wild reindeer hide. The example of this kind of kuoika that we brought to the Museum of the Institute of Eth- nography in Leningrad has a small girdle with appendages of glass beads and little buttons, representing gifts (Fig. 6). The mistress-of-the- tent kuoika was kept in the interior of the tipi in the women's place; only very seldom were any other kuoika brought into the tipl. Since the mistress-of-the-tent kuoika was of female sex, they conducted themselves in respect to it in the same manner as to a woman. Thus for example, when the tent was struck, her figure was brought out last together with the women's belongings which, as is well known, were held to be unclean. It was carried out wrapped in a woman's blanket and laid on the "unclean" sled where the clothes and so forth of the women were. Some kuoika were especially reverenced, as, for example, the kuoika of the Ngoybuo clan, which were, in reality, cult objects of all Vadeev- Nganasan. These kuoika were kept by the family of Bultschu, the youngest of the Ngoybuo brothers. They were two stones, one of which was con- sidered a male and the other a female. There was a bow and arrow with the male stone, and with the female, one, a needle, thread, and a little woman's purse of skin with all kinds of rags. Besides this, they also had a "bear" in the form of a bear skin. Both kuoika were kept in a round chest whose in- ner wall was embellished with diagonal black and red lines. Tuymi, Bultshu's older brother, told me, "Our kuoika are of Tungus origin. They appeared at the time when heaven and earth were created and are derived from the Tungus with the * sewed up' 3 faces. Once I got sick with measles; my whole family was sick in bed, too. In daylight, when I was wide awake, the master of the kuoika appeared before me in the flesh. An old Tungus came in who began to say something in his dialect. I didn't understand a word. Then he said to me in Yakut language, ' Three days from now you must move on, then all will be well.' I didn't even notice how he disappeared again." This same Bultshu complained to me, "Some years ago, Dyatobie got sick on the hunt after he had eaten of a sick reindeer. When I heard of this, I sought him out, brought him home with me half dead, and began to entreat my kuoika to bring about his recovery, promising that, after restor- ation of his health, Dyatobie would definitely give them a good reindeer cow. When Dyatobie re- covered, however, he withheld the reindeer cow from the kuoika. I reminded him of it again, but he refused. The next day a wolf ate up this same reindeer cow which I had asked him for for my kuoika. So little do people honor the kuoika these days I Moreover, Dyatobie almost came to grief 2. Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish why these kuoika have two heads because of the great reticence of the Nganasan, especially in regard to their religious ideas. 3. Tatooed.</page><page sequence="4">POPOV: GUARDIAN SPIRITS AMONG THE NGANASAN 125 himself. He was chasing this reindeer cow's calf out on the ice. The ice proved very thin; Dyatobie broke through and we pulled him out with a looped rope just in the nick of time." One day my host, Urannik, said to me, tfYou live in the neighborhood of the famous kuoika of the Ngoibuo clan. Perhaps you could give them a coin.'' And then, somewhat later, he added, "By the way, don't give them a coin. You evidently went into a tent where there was a woman in childbed. When you visited Konguptie, whose wife was delivered of a child a short time ago, you probably had coins in your pocket, and after your departure, the parturient tramped in your foot- prints. Such coins are unclean; the kuoika don't want them at all. Rather, give the kuoika a big piece of paper; then you will have luck. It's too bad that you don't know how to shoot; the kuoika would bring you much success. When you are driving to Bultshu's tent, at least bow many times from a distance in the direction where the kuoika sled stands and ask that the kuoika may bring you luck. If you give them paper, don't do it yourself, deliver it through Bultshu." When Bultshu's nephew, the young hunter Tyi- moro, accidentally shot himself through the hand, the incident was explained by the fact that after his return from a successful hunt he had not brought the customary present to the kuoika of his kin, which he had formerly been accustomed to do. Bultshu sent a messenger to the shaman on May 12, 1937. In the winter everyone had been stricken with measles and they had promised, in case of fortunate recovery, to build a new sled for the kuoika after arrival at the Balakhnya River. Unfortunately, they concealed the sled-making ceremony from me. I succeeded, however, in taking a photograph of the skin of the slaughtered reindeer, together with the hitched-up new sled (Fig. 8). I made the photograph in the daytime when all the men were off hunting. As was to be expected, however, those remaining in the tent reported the happening to Bultschu. That evening he came to me in the yurt and said, "Your action was not right. We are very frightened that you looked at the kuoika sled and took its shadow (photographed it). If only the kuoika don't get angry and something bad happens to us and to you, too!" When the time of confinement of a woman from our camp approached, her family moved to an- other nomadic camp in order not to defile the Ngoibuo kuoika. ^ The following fact shows us 4. Childbirth was considered unclean among the Nganasan. what great respect the kuoika of the Ngoibuo clan enjoyed among the other families of the Vadeev- Nganasan. At the beginning of June 1937, all nomadic camps were hastening to move to the north in order to cross over the Balakhnya River before the spring flood. The encampment of Mandyuptie, a Nganasan of the Kuptyik clan, waited a full three days until our camp, where the kuoika of the Ngoi- buo clan were located, should start out. They did not want to cross the path of the kuoika, since they believed this would insult them. Also, the repre- sentatives of other clans often applied to these kuoika, which displeased the people of the Ngoibuo clan very much. One day they complained to me, "We aren't at all pleased that strange people like Balda and Urannik of the Okuo clan come to our kuoika and offer presents to them. That way they steal the luck which the Ngoibuo kuoika intended for us." When the large nomad groups split up into smaller ones in the spring, it happened within one group that two households, one of which possessed the more honored kuoika, went off in opposite di- rections. The one household really moved far away, while the other remained at the place and only pretended to break camp, but in reality set up their tents again after they had traveled a kilometer or even less. This was done so that the sacred kuoika should not believe the household just stayed behind and neglected them but that it had been necessary for them to go in another di- rection. In general, they avoided having two families with especially esteemed kuoika live in one camp, because the kuoika allegedly did not get along well with one another, which was not without effect on the fate of the owner. From all the things said, it is evident that the kuoika, although they brought advantages to man, did things entirely out of selfishness, expecting a reward for everything, even the smallest service. Moreover, each kuoika owner always had to take care not to insult his kuoika since then they showed themselves to be ruthless and could punish with sickness or death. The Tasyadya Nganasan of the Taimyr Peninsula had a wolf kuoika. This was a wolf skin with head and claws intact. This kuoika was hostile to children, and if they touched its sled, it punished them with death. Fonarantu Forbin, a Taimyr -Nganasan, had a natural stone kuoika which looked like a man' s head with protruding eyes. Once when his house- hold got sick, he asked his kuoika to help him. In order to insure that the words of the petition reached the kuoika, it was usual to tap it with a stick. There was no stick close at hand, however, and Fonarantu began to strike the kuoika with the</page><page sequence="5">126 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY 1, 2 iron spear point of a khorey^ and in doing so he struck out one of its eyes. Immediately there- after he, himself, became blind in one eye. By virtue of these peculiarities, the kuoika often changes from a protector and helper to a heavy burden. Once a person has established a kuoika for himself, he can not get rid of it in any way. If he throws it out, then its spirit comes back anyhow and devours its owner for such a contemptuous act. Tasyadya, the above mentioned Nganasan, repeatedly lamented that, despite the fact that his kuoika was useful to him, he would be glad to get rid of it, only he was afraid to do so. It must be mentioned that great respect is paid only to such kuoika as are believed really to ren- der this or that help when turned to in cases of need. Not all kuoika fulfill their function consci- entiously, however, and in such cases people complain about them frankly, throw them here and there, and even toss them out. In order for no misfortune to ensue, neighbors usually put them back in the sled again. My host Urannik habitually complained about his kuoika, *My kuoi- ka are worthless. They don't help at all." When I reproached him, u Why do you talk so disparag- ingly of your kuoika; look at your neighbor, Bult- shu, how he honors his kuoika/' he told me in answer, *No, I'm not afraid. My kuoika really are very poor." In spite of all this he neverthe- less deemed it necessary "to feed" his kuoika after a successful hunt in the autumn. He took a ladle, put glowing coals in it on which he laid pieces of wild reindeer fat, and he put the filled vessel on the ground under the sled in which he kept the kuoika. Among the Avam -Nganasan- in contrast to the Vadeev-Nganasan- the kuoika are tended by the women exclusively; men substitute for them only when they are ill or pregnant. Among the Vadeev- Nganasan they only allowed non-pregnant women to yoke reindeer to the sleds of kuoika that were not especially honored. The kuoika were kept and transported in special sleds usually having three uprights for the sled box. The sleds were covered with wild reindeer skin. The sled covers were renewed annually in case of successful reindeer hunting. If a new sled was built, it, also, got a new reindeer -skin cover. Among the Nganasan it was even forbidden to use the old cover oneself for other purposes, and they gave these to the Dolgan or Yakut who made reindeer girths out of them. On September 6, 1937, Bultschu covered his kuoika sled with a wild reindeer skin which he had received as a present from Urannik. He did this because the slain wild reindeer had an unusually strange set of antlers which was interpreted as a special favor of the patron spirit of hunting. Uran- nik had not noticed this peculiarity of the antlers when he gave the reindeer to Bultschu. Later he regretted his act very much and believed that he had forfeited, by this relinquishment, the hunting luck which the hunting spirit had granted him. Bultschu covered his kuoika sled with the skin, hung the inner fat of the reindeer on the bayka^ and later put it in the sled. He placed the head of the reindeer on the front of the sled in a backward position. The sled stood like this for seven days. In many cases, as for example in connection with the above described kuoika of the Ngoibuo clan, the kuoika sled had three uprights on the left side for the sled box but four on the right (Fig. 9). It was explained that the sled of a famous kuoika has to have a special appearance that deviates from the customary sled shape. Occasionally the sled runners were built in the shape of fish, in which case they had the form of a fish head on the back ends. Iron points were hammered on, also, to represent the fins. Be- sides this, notched iron plates in the form of little combs were attached to the front and back ends of the runners in order to protect the kuoika from the attacks of bad spirits. They hung the likeness of a little dugout canoe under the sled seat, so the kuoika could get over the river if need be. Often glass beads, copper buttons, little metal disks and other trifles were hung on the ends of the side slats of the seat. Inside the sled box, a black wild reindeer hide served as a bed for the kuoika. They changed the kuoika sled every three years; the old sled was discarded and the kuoika laid in the new one. A special ceremony was per- formed with the new sled before the transfer of the kuoika into it. A reindeer was slaughtered and the skin with head and hoofs was hung up, pointing eastward, on a tree trunk. Then they harnessed the dead reindeer, like a living one, to the new sled, and the sled remained like this for three days. During this time, the soul of the slain rein- deer traveled to the sun, so that it would send many new reindeer in place of this one. The 5. Khorey: A long staff for goading reindeer on a sled trip.

These ceremonies were performed in spring at the end of the polar night. In the nomadic camps the kuoika sleds were located at the end of the long row of sleds; this was done in order that women and any strangers who spoke another dialect, for example, Dolgans, Yakuts, or Russians, should not go past the kuoika since this would have desecrated them. Not only the kuoika but also the "clean" cargo was put on the kuoika sled: hunting and fishing implements, men's clothing, fish, and wild rein- deer meat. In summer it was also permissable to hang up wild reindeer meat on this sled in order to air-dry it. Special reindeer with a peculiar brand mark were hitched to the kuoika sled (Fig. 10). The sled of a kuoika of female sex was drawn by a reindeer cow. It was not customary to ride behind the kuoika' s reindeer, you did not slaughter them, and if they died, their flesh was not eaten. The Vadeev -Nganasan, who had few reindeer at their disposal, hitched up kuoika reindeer, too, part of the time, but only to * clean" men's sleds on which no women' s paraphernalia had been laid, and they harnessed them only with * clean" gear.? That was mainly done in spring when the draft reindeer grew terribly lean. In fall, after a successful hunt, fat as well as smoked reindeer and goose meat was accommo- dated on the kuoika sled. Not until spring, at the time of the migration of the geese, were these provisions consumed at the family feast that was arranged out of joy that the people had been al- lowed to live until spring. At the owner's death, the youngest son inherit- ed the kuoika. In order to get help from the kuoika in case of need, the older sons of the deceased, who had already left the family during the lifetime of the father, visited the youngest brother in whose keeping the kuoika were or brought the kuoika for a time into their own camp. They gave them back again later. If there were no heirs, then strangers took pos- session of the kuoika, for in case no one harbored them, the patron spirits of the kuoika came back anyhow and avenged themselves on the survivors by causing illness among them. If their owner lay on his death bed, some kuoika wept and pitied him. The surviving family mem- bers would build a new sled without side slats. Among the neighboring tribes -the Dolgan, Yakut, and Tungus- the Nganasan kuoika were es- teemed as the most powerful and frightening. If anyone at all offended a Nganasan, then the Ngana- san, after his return home, would open the sled, set up his kuoika near it, and smear it with the blood of a reindeer specially killed for this pur- pose. Then he would lift the sled up and, leaning on the forecarriage with his hands, accuse his of- fender and ask for his punishment. Or instead he would bring his kuoika into his tent, smoke its face over the hearth fire and say, "May the face of my enemy burn just like yours." After that, the enemy was supposed to die with face boils. From everything said, it is clear that the do- mestic kuoika of the Nganasan were objects who sheltered spirits in themselves. These spirits protected a single family or clan in this or that respect. The existence of a common spirit and master of all kuoika with whose dispensation the shaman assigned single spirits to chosen objects merits special attention. This circumstance leads one to think that there was a great difference between the deities and spirits of higher class and the kuoika spirits. The latter were a special category of lower -order spirits and were less powerful than the former. In closing, it seems justifiable to raise the question-Can the kuoika of the Nganasan be regarded as fetishes? I believe the question can only be answered in the negative since, nowa- days, by fetishes we mean the veneration of objects themselves and not the veneration of the spirits embodied in them. 7.
