<plain_text><page sequence="1">Volume XXXVII October, 1927 No. 4 THE MONIST HF most striking difference between European and In dian philosophy is perhaps to be found in their differing attitudes to the problem of the relation of religion to philos ophy. Since the early days of Greek thought philosophy and religion have been at war. Xenophanes and Colophon raised the banner of revolt with his satiric description of the gods and goddesses : "Yes, and if oxen and horses and lions had hands, and could paint with their hands, and pro duce works of art as men do, horses would paint the forms of the gods like horses, and oxen like oxen, and make their bodies in the image of their several kinds." "The Ethio pians make their gods black and snub-nosed; the Thracians say theirs have blue eyes and red hair." He poured scorn on Homer and Hesiod for having ascribed to the Gods "all things that are a shame and a disgr?be^?mong mortals, stealings and adulteries, deceivings of one another." No wonder if under these onslaughts the religious faith of at least a few enlightened individuals began to shake. The seed was sown and under the withering dialectic of Socra tes religion in the sense of the ordinary traditional religion was routed out by the philosophical schools, and the divorce betwen the two came to be the dominating note of European philosophy in the ages to come. It is true that in the Middle Ages there flourished some of the subtlest intellects that Europe has ever produced, and in them the demands of both seem to have been harmonized, but the dominant interest of the age was religious, and philosophy had to accomodate itself to the religious demands of the PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION</page><page sequence="2">488 THE MONIST age. In other words, philosophy had to play the second fiddle, and freedom, which is the very breath of philosophy, had to be sacrificed, so as not to ofifend the powers that were. In modern European philosophy, the philosophers that have made the history of philosophy were men sus pected by theologians. Most of them refused to subscribe to the dogmas of the Church, and those that did were al most apologetic in their tone. No wonder if the Roman Catholic world still looks to the philosophers of the Middle Ages to square its philosophic hunger with its religious convictions. What is even more noteworthy in European philosophy is the sense of pride that philosophy has eman cipated itself from the thraldom of religion. Philosophy has to reign supreme. It is from this standpoint that Indian philosophy is criticized as yet continuing in the stage that was transcended on the very threshold of Greek phil osophy. On the other hand, in India it is this very divorce between philosophy and religion that is regarded as the weakest and the most vulnerable point in Western philos ophy. To an average Indian, religion is the salt of life and a philosopher without religion sounds mere materialism, a thing of mere intellectual jugglery which may as well be not studied as studied. It is clear that this difference of outlook is fundamental. Which is the correct attitude? Is any reconciliation be tween these two hostile attitudes possible? These are the questions that this paper seeks to answer. In the very beginning wre must frankly face the fact that there is no reconciliation possible between philosophy and the great historic religions in the dogmatic garbs which they have assumed during the lapse of centuries. For, philosophy, to be true to its name, must be based on reason, while the historic religions are all based on revela tion, which claims to be above reason. Their appeal is to the faith of men. "Believe and ye shall be saved" is their</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 489 exhortation. This can be the only justification for the elaborate theological systems which have been constructed on the basis of the simple teachings of the great Masters. The maintenance of such a system requires an elaborate organization of priesthood, a body of men often learned and as a rule tenaciously conservative. To them reason has no claim whatsoever to sit in judgment on the truths of revelation as conceived by them. Thus it is that a conflict between the free spirit of philosophy and a dogmatic the ology was inevitable, and this conflict runs right through the history of European philosophy. The question arises at this stage as to how it is that Hinduism as a religion has not come into conflict with philosophy. Prima facie it stands out as an exception to the rule that mere faith and philosophy cannot live in peace together. Is it because the claims of reason are subordinated to the inspired Vedas and the Upanishads? in which case philosophy can sub sist only in a restricted sphere with its wings effectually clipped. Or has philosophy been allowed full freedom of thought, and yet it has independently established the truth of the Vedas and the Upanishads ? It is interesting to note that the highest pramana recognized by Indian philoso phers is the sabda pramana (proof by the Word or Reve lation). If this is taken literally, we cannot escape the conclusion that philosophy in India must at bottom be the ology. This is a criticism which has been freely advanced against it by European scholars, who argue moreover that Indian philosophy has not advanced and cannot advance because it has no independence : it can only be a theology: The validity of this criticism, however, is challenged by Indian scholars like Mr. V. Subrahmanya Iyer. As an Advaitin he is not concerned to repudiate the correctness of this criticism so far as the other schools are concerned. So far as the Advaita is concerned, he maintains that Sankara was not a theologian; that his arguments are all</page><page sequence="4">490 THE MONIST logical and philosophical, and the references to the Vedas were only meant to support the conclusions of his inde pendent thought. If this claim could be substantiated, the conflict between philosophy and religion would be auto matically solved. Has it been substantiated? At the present day the Vedanta is the only living school of thought in India, and it subsists in the three forms of Advaitism, Visistha-Advaitism, and Dvaitism. In the last two the interest is predominantly religious; their ultimate authority is the Vedas and the Upanishads; their injunc tions are mostly sacerdotal in character; their philosophy has its strength mostly in an astute criticism of Advaitic premises. Hence if an independent and a purely logical philosophy exists in India, it is to be found only in the Advaita of Sankara. In Advaitism the only reality is Brahman, which is nirguna or without quality. In the last resort there is complete identity between the human atman and the Nirguna Brahman, and a man attains moksha when he attains through gyana or knowledge this identity. It is clear that the Nirguna Brahman ex hypothesi cannot be personal, for a person implies qualities, i. e., it cannot be the God of religion to be placated with sacrifices or won over with gifts. If there was any doubt at all on this point it is set at rest by Sankara himself, for he identifies the God of religion or Iswara with Saguna Brahman. This is the God that may be worshipped, and rituals and cere monies and the caste organization and a hundred other things find their justification with reference to it. But Saguna Brahman is not the reality, it is itself in the world of maya. To a gyani, to one who has mastered the reality of Nirguna Brahman, the Saguna Brahman has no worth. Religion with its restrictions is not binding on him, it has no joys or terrors for him. It is meant only for the masses, the ordinary struggling weak humanity, the ignorant. To them alone is the worship of Iswara real, not to the gyani.</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 49I It is clear that the worship of an unreal Iswara is radi cally opposed to the deepest convictions of the truly re ligious. For them God represents the highest reality, and the innermost desire of their hearts is to walk in the path of righteousness as chalked out for them by His chosen Prophet, and to be at one with Him in a thorough com munion of spirit. To them Sankara's Iswara is nothing but the merest mockery of God. No wonder if the ortho dox Vaishnavaite speaks of an Advaitin as a nastika (atheist.) It is a fact indeed that an average Advaitin manages to harbor in his mind the conception of a Nirguna Brahman, while devoutly performing the worship of Saguna Brahman, and fulfilling a hundred duties connected with the observance of caste regulations. He fails to find any inconsistency in his religious worship and his philo sophical convictions. In fact he feels it to be his duty to carry on his usual worship, not because he believes in its efficacy or in its truth, but as an example to the younger members of his family, as a concession to the frailty of ordinary humanity. If this is the only reconciliation possi ble between the traditional Hinduism and philosophy, an honest thinker might well wonder if this is a reconciliation worth having, for it amounts to nothing more than a work ing compromise in no way differing from the way in which an astute lawyer or a business man lays the flattering unction to his soul that business is business, wherein the ordinary canons of morality find no place. Thus it is that Sankara can be said to have made good his claim to be a philosopher and no mere theologian. But religion from the standpoint of the Reality has been given a go-by. It is real only to those who do not know better, just as to an ignorant child a doll is as good as a living baby. There are so many Advaitins in India who think they have solved the problem of the relation of religion and philosophy, and yet it is only a solution, if it be a solution at all, in which</page><page sequence="6">492 THE MONIST religion is given a place on sufferance, as a make-believe, a concession to the masses, ultimately of no more worth than the fleeting sense experience, which is the main stay of the theory of maya. From that standpoint religion is only a stage in the upward growth of man, something like what a kindergarten is in the education of children. Even if the teaching of Sankara on this point can be taken to be a definite solution, it is certainly not a solution of the prob lem we are dealing with. To the religious-minded, to the soul that is hungering to commune with a personal God, Sankara's philosophy appears cold and bleak. They feel bewildered before its ruthless logic, but they find it a logic, subtle yet unconvincing. We noted in the very beginning of this paper that a reconciliation between philosophy and traditional religion is impossible, and the one exception that seemed at least plausible?Sankatfa's Advaitism?has been found to be no real exception. It is a discouraging conclusion, and so it is all the more necessary to try and see if it is possible to reconcile in any sense the warring claims of philosophy and religion. To do so we have to be clear about the sig nificance of religion. To begin with a definition of it would be mere dogmatism. We should first of all be clear as to the implications of religious experience?for it is on this experience that the truth of religion is sought to be es tablished?and then try to see in what sense a religion is possible that is not in flagrant contradiction to the dictates of reason. An appeal to reason in one form or another is inevitable, for the craving for religion finds expression in religions, and religions are not consistent with one an other. As to which is worthy of our acceptance and our homage is?or at least ought to be?a matter of reasonable thought. Of course an ordinary man does not trouble to think about this ; he is content to believe what his parents have believed : religion is to him something that has to be</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 493 accepted in the same spirit as the country in which he is horn. But from this point of view the cannibalistic re ligion of the savage has as much right to credence as the highly advanced monotheistic religions. Even among the latter there are marked differences, and the superiority of Judaism or Christianity, Zoroastrianism or Mohammedan ism, Hinduism or Buddhism can only be settled at the bar of reason. So, from the philosophic standpoint, the ulti mate survival value of a particular religion or of religion in general must necessarily be determined by what harmon ises most with reason, or at least by what comes least into conflict with reason. All religion implies a belief in the existence of some thing that is superior to us : whether that something is con ceived as a fetich, or as personified forces of nature, or as a plurality of divine beings, or as one supreme God. In any of these cases the recognition of a superior power implies in us a consciousness of our weakness and a sense of humil ity. The next step, whether psychologically or logically, is to have a desire to be on the right side of this superior power, and this marks the beginnings of worship. In primitive religions this worship is more the outcome of fear than of an exalted emotion. But with the growth of knowledge and a sense of human kinship a higher type of morality supervenes which affects the conception of God. He comes to be thought of not as a jealous, angry or blood thirsty god, but as one who is full of mercy and love for struggling humanity, who is to be worshipped not as an ogre, but as a loving Father. This is the stage to which the highest religious consciousness has attained. God be comes not merely superior to us, He becomes supreme in the whole universe. In the language of metaphysics, he becomes the Ultimate Reality. Once this stage is attained, worship takes the form of love and devotion, till in the case of God-intoxicated individuals like the mystics and the</page><page sequence="8">494 THE MONIST bhaktas (devotees of God) this love of God takes the form of an ecstatic union with God, which is mystic ex perience par excellence. It is on the reality of this ex perience that the truth of religion and the truth of God are asserted. It would hardly be fair to doubt the reality of it, for it is associated with some of the loftiest teachers of humanity in all climes and in all ages. Zoroaster, Isaiah, and Christ were all mystics. Even in more recent centuries the flow of mysticism has not been exhausted, as is evidenced by the line of Christian mystics in Europe like Eckhart or St. Francis or St. Teresa and the Sufi mystics of Persia; and India has ever been the home of mystics like Kabir and Chaitanya, Ramdas and Tukaram and a host of others. There is a remarkable resemblance in the outpourings of the mystic heart : love, joy, communion with the divine. To illustrate the point we may adduce a few examples from Kabir, the prince of mystics. "If you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you will find your life in the Supreme Land of Bliss." "There is an endless world, O my brother, and there is the Nameless Being, of whom nought can be said. Only he knows it who has reached that region: it is other than all that is heard and said. No form, no body, no length, no breadth is seen there : how can I tell you that which it is ? He comes to the path of the Infinite on whom the grace of the Lord descends: he is freed from births and deaths who attains to Him. Kabir says: Tt cannot be told by the words of the mouth, it cannot be written on paper: It is like a dumb person who tastes a sweet thing? how shall it be explained ?' " From the depths of his loving soul Thomas ? Kempis cries out : "Ah, Lord God, when shall I be entirely united and lost in Thee, and altogether forgetful of myself ? Thou</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 495 in me, and I in Thee; even so grant that we may in like manner continue together in one." This desire to be at one with God is the mark of all re ligion, and the fulfillment of that desire marks the acme of a religious personality. For this reason we may define re ligion as an emotional realisation of the Ultimate Reality. It is certainly not intellectual in character. Mystics em ploy no arguments except poetic analogies; they make no pretense of convincing by logical arguments. In fact more often than not they refuse to talk to any except those who are already in some way prepared to feel a hunger for God. So far there is nothing in mystic experience to antag onise philosophers. Both accept that man is not ultimate. Both believe in the existence of something supernatural, some sort of ultimate reality. They part company in two respects. The religious mystic emphasizes emotion and intuition, while the philosopher seeks to grasp the signifi cance of the ultimate reality through reason. This differ ence is a matter of detail and need not be emphasized. The other difference is more pertinent to our inquiry: religion conceives the ultimate reality as a personal God, while philosophy on the whole conceives it as impersonal?on the whole, for philosophy differs with philosophers. Theism is a form of philosophy, but it would not be wrong to say that the weight of the greatest philosophers, whether in ancient Greece or modern Europe (e. g. Spinoza and Hegel) or India (e. g. Sankara), is thrown on the side against theism, and in the traditional conflict between philosophy and religion it is the anti-theistic philosophy that has had to bear the brunt of warfare. For the purposes of this paper it would be too long to substantiate the position that the ultimate reality must be conceived as impersonal, but to avoid the charge of dogma tism we shall briefly point out the main difficulties involved in theism. First of all, the attributes of omnipresence,</page><page sequence="10">496 THE MONIST omniscience and omnipotence are not reconcilable with one another. Omniscience involves a knowledge of the future and this gives rise to the dilemma: either this foreknowl edge must come true, which means a palpable limit to omnipotence, or omnipotence must involve the possibility of doing anything at any time, in which case foreknowledge loses its edge. It is possible to argue that God cannot be conceived as an irresponsible despot, but that He is Him self bound by the laws of His own devising ; that even He is bound by His own laws of righteousness and justice. This is an eminently sensible position to maintain, but it reduces the compatibility of omnipotence and omniscience to mere verbosity. Further, personality implies finiteness. The very rise of this conception has been due to the neces sity of expressing the play of a finite human self on the stage of life. There has been an inveterate tendency on the part of human beings to be anthropomorphic and to con ceive God in the image of man, a procedure which can hardly be countenanced by sober reason. To conceive Him as a personality is to make Him finite, when the essence of God is His infinitude in al directions. The conception of personality may be the highest possible to bring out the superiority of man on earth. Whether it is so high as to be applicable even to the Highest is certainly open to ques tion. The general prejudice against describing God or the Ultimate Reality as impersonal is for the most part due to the mistaken idea that impersonality implies lifelessness, rigidity, inertia. Far from this being the case, the philoso phers who emphasize the impersonality of the Ultimate emphasize it as a principle of activity essentially rational. But the theist continues to argue: "From your stand point what becomes of worship and the worth of mystic experience?" The answer to this is that worship is only the homage of the heart to what our head recognises as supreme on rational grounds. No sane person has ever</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 497 arrogated to himself the powers of God, though the mis directed zeal of followers may at times have conferred the halo of divinity on their favorite heroes. On the other hand, every person who has not been victimised by the cheap logic of pessimism or of naked atheism has felt the call of the highest. The genuine leaders of human thought in every country and age have borne witness to the pres ence of something great, something exalted, something that makes for order, for righteousness. It is this con sciousness that sustains men in their battles against chaos and unrighteousness. It is their consciousness that reason ultimately rules the world that gives them strength to keep up their courage in the midst of disappointments. This consciousness is there: latent in all, actual in most. The difficulty comes when we seek to express this consciousness. Our mind is baffled in its struggle to envisage this Reason, Logos, God or whatever we choose to call it, in Its immen sity, power and glory. In this incapacity of the human mind lies the root of the desire to personify. Our heart yearns to worship. But we cannot worship an idea, how ever much we are convinced of its truth, and so we are driven to symbolize, and our religious worship slakes its thirst in the worship of symbols: fire in Zoroastrianism, idols in Hinduism, the cross in Christianity, Mecca in Mo hammedanism, not to mention the forgotten creeds of the past. The wise recognize the One under the formalism of a thousand symbols. That is why the language of the mys tics is the deepest language of the human heart, and throbs with the same pulse of life. Where they differ is in the different names under which the One presents itself : to the Hindu it is Rama, or Vishnu or Shiva ; to the Christian it is Christ ; to the Moslem Sufi it is the beloved. The ignor ant and the fanatic confound the symbol with the Real and seek to exhaust the richness of the One in some arbitrary symbol of human creation.</page><page sequence="12">4g8 THE MONIST But the average theist is not likely to be satisfied with this selfless worship. He wants a God, to Whom he can pray: ask for favors and seek forgiveness. Now it is re markable that this demand is made only by the lesser minds. The genuine mystics, the genuine adorers of God scorn this demand. They do not ask for favors, they do not grumble against the unkindness of their lot in life. They are content to be the bhaktas (devotees) of God; they rejoice in poverty, in adversity; they have a childlike faith in the righteousness of things: "God's in His Heaven,? All's right with the world !" They merely crave for communion with Him, and when they find it, the craving of their soul finds rest. Thus it is that the demands of the highest philosophy and the highest religion coincide. The God of religion need be nothing but the personified aspect of the One of philosophy. The justification for this personification lies in the finiteness of our intellect : what we cannot adequately conceive we must first personify and then symbolize. Art is not the less intellectual because of its symbolism, and religion gains in worth when its mode of worship finds a rational justification. At this stage there is every likelihood of a voice of pro test coming from the camp of the pure rationalist. "If you can get no tangible reward," he argues, "from your worship and your prayers; if your sins are not forgiven, where is the sense of worshipping? Why waste time in idle prayers ? In fact your argument reduces worship and prayers to a mere luxury of the heart : a pageant to delight the senses with the fragrance of incense, the music of hymns, the drama of color. It is a palpable make-believe, a device to hold the masses in leash, a mere show, nay a sham. A philosophy which seeks to rationalize such mummery is doubly guilty: because it is untrue to itself,</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION 499 and because by a specious rationalization it seeks to per petuate the tyranny of priests who find their last prop in the ignorance of the masses." I should be the last person to deny that there is considerable justice in this indictment. It has been the universal misfortune of all religions that they have been mutilated and tortured out of shape to suit the second rate intellect and more often the cupidity of an organised priesthood. But the ritual that has been the creation of an interested priesthood?while it has succeeded in capturing the imagination of the masses?has been uni formly repudiated by the true bhaktas, for their heart has rebelled against the prostitution of divine love that is the result of vicarious sacrifices and prayers. They believe in the worship of the heart which makes them purer and better men. The real justification of prayers is to be found in the fact that they exert a purifying influence on the mind and contribute to the development of the mind. This is a truth which was always well understood by the Upanishadic psy chology, and has recently been well recognised by Western psychologists under the compelling influence of Cou? in France. Cou?ism together with the indubitable instances of telepathy and clairvoyance has irrefutably established the power of the human mind. Through the activity and con centration of mind things have been achieved that are ordi narily impossible and that in ignorant ages were justifiably regarded as miracles, but that in our scientific age can be easily explained as the result of the almost limitless capacity of our mind. The power of auto-suggestion has been shown to be a conqueror of nervous diseases through the commanding influence of the mind, and this logic applies equally to its power over our thoughts. Thus prayer and worship, when practised with the re quisite amount of sincerity and concentration, become the grand instruments of self-culture, and herein lies their full est psychological and philosophical justification. They are</page><page sequence="14">500 THE MONIST the means of concentrating our mind on higher things and thereby attuning ourselves to the spirit that pervades the world. To conceive prayer as the means of asking for favors or forgiveness is to misconceive the essential purpose of prayer. According to the law of Karma the past cannot be undone, but sincere repentance is a conquest over the future so far as it makes a repetition of the old sins im possible. Sincere prayer strengthens this repentance and thus purifies the sinner. As has been mentioned above, the true devotees of God do not care to ask for favors : they only want to be one with Him, and to achieve their purpose they become lost in bhakU, devotion, prayer. It is imma terial how God is named; it is enough if He is conceived as the Spirit of Righteousness, Asha, Rta, ruling the uni verse. The very uniformity of mystic experience proves the truth of this, for the Christian attains Him through the worship of Christ, and the Vaishnavite through that of Sri Krishna, and so on in different religions. The im mediate object of devotion is?or at least sounds?differ ent, but the ultimate object is just one, howsoever differ ently He is called. The need of having some tangible object of worship is at bottom psychological, for the human mind finds it hard to grapple with abstract concepts, and the tendency to per sonify is one of the most deep-rooted in our nature. The concept of the Universal Reason, Nous Brahman, is one that cannot be visualised. And yet to prevent the mind from wandering some object of concentration is needed. The need to personify the Ultimate is pressing and the concept of a personal God is the result. At this stage, what is more natural than to conceive the Supreme in terms of a known hero, who has already distinguished himself as a great warrior or lawgiver or teacher? He becomes the visible embodiment of Godhead; the symbol and the Sym bolised are confused, and in historic sequence the worship</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION of the One takes on different forms agreeable to the genius and the history of different peoples. The intimate connection which has through the ages subsisted between religion, poetry, music, architecture and painting, has not been accidental. All art is personification, and religion, by a deep-seated need of the mind, tends to be centered in some personified deity. Primitive religion and mythology are the first crude philosophical ventures of the human spirit. Tt has taken centuries for us to outgrow these mythologies?and yet who can say that we have completely outgrown them even today? But if we have outgrown them at all, the credit of it must go to the patient, clarifying thought of the philosophers and the discoveries of the scientists. With a better philosophy our religion has bettered too, for religion is nothing but personified philosophy. If philosophy has established the supremacy of some one concept, our head is satisfied with it, but our heart in its yearning for worship needs its personification, and in the highest religions God is nothing but this per sonified aspect of the One of philosophy. The main threads of our argument may perhaps be as well brought together. The task of philosophy is to com prehend the Ultimate Reality, a task which is essentially intellectual in character. The ordinary traditional religion with its emphasis on faith and on revelation is not com petent to replace philosophy and so the two are incompati ble. But philosophy in its intellectualism is not satisfying to the heart, unless it can develop a religion which is not inimical to the supreme dictates of reason. Such a religion is to be found in personifying the Ultimate of philosophy, and in fact that is what every great religion consciously or unconsciously has done, and that is why it has been able to hold its place in spite of its crude dogmatisms. I do not mean to say that the object of religion is a fiction, as San kara conceives Iszvara to be a mere part of maya. The</page><page sequence="16">502 the monist personification is justifiable from the standpoint of the need of worship and prayer, which are the grand instruments of self-culture, as recent psychology has shown. In the last resort the God of religion and the Ultimate of philosophy are identical. The former is an expression more suited to the aesthetic and the emotional aspects of our nature, while the latter expression is more suited to the intellectual side of our nature. Both are justified, because in an indi vidual human being all the sides of his nature are not equal ly developed, and each man must have the freedom to en visage the Ultimate Reality in the way best suited to him. Religion and philosophy are but two modes of apprehend ing the ultimate nature of the world. God and the Abso lute of Brahman are but two names to designate two aspects of one and the same reality.
