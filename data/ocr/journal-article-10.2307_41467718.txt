<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eighteenth Century, vol. 28, no. 2, 1987 ESSAY REVIEWS READING VOLTAIRE'S CONTES Patrick Coleman Carol Sherman's book comes at an opportune moment in Voltaire studies.1 Literary historians continue to find new information about the origins and context of the contes , but an increasing number of scholars are asking uncomfortable questions about the kind of criticism these tales invite. As with other familiar authors, we seem to be presented with a choice between pursuing new interpretations (by whatever method) and searching for the "poetics" of the text - those conventions and devices that allow the various meanings to emerge. Lionel Gossman has forcefully argued for the second approach in his seminal article on "Voltaire's Heavenly City": "The real choice is ... not between different senses of the text, but between awareness and unawareness of the organization controlling the various senses and making them possible, that is, between a higher and more comprehensive and a lower or less comprehensive pattern of intelligibility."2 Yet Gossman's program has not been carried out as fully as one might have expected. Perhaps the politics of Gossman's position, which focuses all too clearly on the limitations of Voltaire's bourgeois ideal, have been found constrictive. For example, although her approach in some ways resembles Gossman's, Carol Sherman defensively affirms the continued relevance of the tales by pointing out the world's need for the tolerance they preach. She denies that Voltaire is "still read because a tyrannical bourgeoisie continues to impose its corpus" (11), but she is clearly uneasy about the status of the contes. To what new comprehensive pattern of intelligibility should we refer them - if any? If, as she claims, no one really disagrees about the general import of the conteSy then either today's voltairiens are blinkered by ideology or the tales, however relevant, do not really matter to literary criticism - for the move to a formalist criticism, on today's critical scene, is usually prompted by a surfeit of rival interpretations whose multiplicity demands explanation. In the absence of interpretive combat, formalism loses some of its dialectical punch because readers are not only less likely to be startled or instructed 171</page><page sequence="2">1 72 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY by the features it foregrounds but also less motivated, as a consequence, to seek out those aspects of the text that would "undermine" in post-structuralist fashion any formalist generalization. But do we agree on the meaning of the contesi Sherman seems to minimize the extent to which readers of, say, Candide , differ about the significance of the hero's garden. Perhaps Sherman's belief that Voltaire evades serious philosophical discussion in the contes (13) leads her to downplay such disputes as quibbles without effect on the overall clarity of Voltaire's polemical thrust. But how shall we reconcile her stand, reasonable enough as it is, with the argument made with equal cogency in this journal a few years ago that "everything seems to be known" about the tales "except what they are and what they mean"?3 Clifton Cherpack's analysis of L'Ingénu offers a long list of baffling inconsistencies, textual puzzles, and questions about the generic expectations we should bring to the contes , all of which makes one wonder how they have survived for two hundred years. In a sense, though, Sherman and Cherpack are both right, for most of us think we know what we need to know about the tales and are content to admit our ignorance about the rest. Such an attitude, however faithful to the spirit of eighteenth-century philosophie , might well support the charge of bourgeois complacency before a cherished cultural monument. Or it may reflect a conviction, easily congruent with but distinct from the reaction just mentioned, that the contes are simply not literature of the first rank and should not be held to the standards we apply to someone like Flaubert. This heretical opinion is rarely voiced among dix-huitièmistes , though, and not only for reasons of professional self-interest. Voltaire's tales are felt to be important, but it is not easy to capture their value in critical discourse. Their practical worth seems clear enough, but to show it is not deemed a critical act; and the absence of real debate about them as texts becomes, in today's critical climate, a sign of their lack of artistic legitimacy. The dispiriting consequences of this dilemma can be seen in the recent controversy over Roy Wolper's revisionist reading of the contes .4 Wolper exercises his considerable polemical talent in an attempt to shake up what he calls the Voltaire establishment, which he believes has neglected the literary character of the tales. Underlying his challenge is the notion that if indeed Voltaire's fiction counts, then it should generate, or at least accommodate,</page><page sequence="3">COLEM AN- VOLTAIRES CONTES 1 73 more interpretive ingenuity than he finds in his opponents. The latter, who include Lester Crocker and Vivienne Mylne, have, I believe, successfully refuted many of Wolper's theses, especially his view of Candide as a "gull in the garden" or dupe meant to be mocked. But one understands Wolper's impatience with these replies: Is there really nothing else, nothing truly different to be said about Voltaire? I wish Sherman had been able to address the Wolper debate in her book, since her aim is to reconsider the whole question of Voltaire's alleged "clarity." She asks to what degree these works presuppose a cooperative audience willing simply to absorb their message, and to what extent a more skeptical reader can find in the text itself the elements of a dissenting opinion. If her meticulous investigation is not yet the major statement we need about the contes "as literature," one can only admire her willingness to confront basic issues and her ability to make the reader think along with her, not only about the tales but about the methods most appropriate to their peculiar status as didactic fictions. Reading Voltaire's Contes does not claim to offer a new interpretation. According to the author, to speak about Voltaire's "relativism" or his anti-metaphysical stance involves a "formulaic reduction" that tells us little about the tales themselves. Such phrases "are far from exhausting the fiction's capacity to inspire complex actualizations of all the signifying qualities of the text" (13). One can only agree, even though Sherman too quickly identifies interpretation with thematic analysis. But she cannot be faulted for wanting to recover the "semiotic potential" of the contes on all their different levels. She has another aim, too: after showing how the texts open up various avenues of sense she wants to analyze the way Voltaire makes these vistas "clear" to the reader. She thus describes her task as both a semiotic and a hermeneutic one. Since one would expect a hermeneutic approach to include the very interpretations she wants to bracket, Sherman might fruitfully have added that her kind of hermeneutic, with its emphasis on clarity rather than content of understanding, more closely resembles a religious "repetition" of an already-received text than an exploration of a secular one - and noted the irony of applying such a method to Voltaire. This kind of hermeneutic does not seek a "perspective" on the text. Rather, it reenacts what Jean Starobinski calls the "fundamental gestures" of the narrative. Starobinski's own essays on Candide and L'Ingénu 5 show how much can be gained from adopting this</page><page sequence="4">174 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY procedure. While incorporating his findings, Sherman goes a step further. Shedding her role of "cooperative reader," she adopts a more skeptical stance in order to show how the contes "deconstruct their premises, that is, how they are finally made unclear by the traces they bear both of past structures of experience and of ambient ideological changes." She calls this deconstruction, yet as we shall see, it can be debated whether the lack of clarity results from genuine aporias or from less exalted kinds of incoherence. But Sherman does point to real problems in the contes and her two-step method will stimulate many readers to reexamine their own views. Each of the four chapters of her book applies her semiotic, hermeneu tic, and deconstructive investigation to a single tale: Micromégas , Zadig , Candide, and L'Ingénu. Sherman begins with a close analysis of the tale's opening chapter, establishing the "competence" Voltaire presupposes in his reader. She then goes on to study the "syntagmatic process" of the narrative: its spatial and temporal coordinates and the structure of its plot, making extensive use of Propp's morphology of folktales. A third section discusses paradigmatic "oppositions, operations, intertexts" - themes, allusions, and polemical references. Once these contexts have been laid out, the author turns to the "modal communication" of the conte , with pride of place going to Voltaire's many ironic devices. Sherman is especially good on the stylistic quirks that play such an essential part in the text. In the final section of the chapter, and in place of a conclusion, Sherman offers a series of remarks on problematic aspects of the tale, such as the real meaning of work in Candide or the coherence of Zadig as philosophic hero. Having renounced interpretation, the author stands back from pursuing the implications of her skeptical remarks. But taken as a running commentary on the tales, Sherman's book provides a wealth of insightful observations on specific points. Among other examples, I would mention her illuminating discussion of the image of the earth in Micromégas and of the role of analogy in that tale; of Zadig as "enabler" of others' happiness; of the anomalous twenty-second chapter of Candide ; of the problem of tone in L'Ingénu; and, throughout the book, of the importance of deictics in the articulation of the narrative. If some parts of the commentary are less successful, it is often because, despite the rigor of her procedure, Sherman fails to justify the use of certain critical tools. She sees her work as that</page><page sequence="5">COLEMAN- VOLTAIRE S CONTES 175 of a "craftsperson," but there are times one needs to be skeptical about the method as well as the text. The most prominent instance is the application of Propp's grid of "functions" in the plot. Sherman devotes many pages, including several lengthy charts, to a detailed mapping of these functions on the contes without ever telling us why such a framework is relevant to a sophisticated literary work. Certainly the results do not markedly differ from those obtained by other, more conventional means. And the application of such a grid to individual works is, in any case, rather dubious when no comparison is made to the whole of Voltaire's corpus. Indeed, for the results to be meaningful, one might need a corpus of texts extending far beyond Voltaire's. More generally, the organization of the book makes it difficult to pursue, as the subtitle claims, a "semiotics of philosophical narration," because no attempt is made to construct a model of such narration: devices are not grouped or placed in hierarchical relation, nor is the connection between model and individual variation explored. There are semiotic models that try to account for the tensions within a single text, such as Greimas's semiotic square, but Sherman doesn't appeal to them. In fact, my own impression is that the author hews really much closer to traditional kinds of interpretation than she is, perhaps, willing to admit and that she should have given more weight to the hermeneutic side of her project. By focussing on each tale separately, while applying different critical tools in an order more suitable for comparative study, Sherman sometimes falls between two stools. Her qualities as a reader are thus not fully put to use. She excels at formulating the kind of "competence" needed to read Voltaire's style, but to the extent that she declines to examine the question each tale asks her book lacks the focus it needs to pull her observations together. If she is not interested in the question posed by the text (because she believes Voltaire really evades such questions, or for reasons of method), then she still needs to wonder about the critical tools: what is the question, for instance, to which a Proppian mapping is the answer? And who is asking it? The same issue appears at a more elementary level in Sherman's analysis of Voltaire's prose. In her close readings, refusal to interpret sometimes gets in the way of an otherwise insightful view of the text. Take for example the description of the hero's Jansenist cellmate in L'Ingénu: "M. Gordon était un vieillard frais et serein... il s'avança d'un air ouvert et</page><page sequence="6">1 76 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY compatissant vers son compagnon" (ch. 10). Sherman comments: "To the experienced reader of Voltaire's prose, the multiplication of admiring adjectives. . .might seem suspect for a moment, and she might await ironic reversal of their sense. The critical amount of time, one sentence, passes however with no such signals appearing; and the reader accepts the univocity of the description and speech of Gordon" (212). The stylistic point is well-taken but the context ignored. Sherman believes the apparent lack of irony shows a special kind of easy relationship between narrator and reader in the middle part of L'Ingénu. But the description of Gordon is not simple. A Jansenist is not supposed to be rosy- cheeked. Voltaire wants to say that Gordon is not Pascal, not a haggard ascetic but a man in harmony with worldly existence. His serenity is all the more remarkable since he is languishing in jail - a real jail and not the metaphorical "dungeon" of the earth we find in Jansenist preaching. Voltaire's presentation of a happy Jansenist needs in turn to be understood in historical terms, in relation to the political and ecclesiastical circumstances of the 1760s. In her analysis of Micromégas, Sherman shows her awareness of religious references; her lapse here can only be explained by the desire to give formal analysis priority over "thematic" concerns. A more thorny problem appears in Sherman's "deconstructive" readings. These serve admirably as leading questions, but because the author claims a good deal more for them, and because they point to the general question of how Voltaire criticism should proceed, I shall consider in detail her view of Micromégas , the most stimulating and yet problematic of her attempts to "subvert" Voltaire's tales. The cooperative reader of Micromégas easily accepts Voltaire's lesson in relativism. As Sherman says, the terms "big" and "small" are "ceaselessly redefined in a new context by relation to new physical or verbal elements." But a more skeptical reader will, she claims, find the conte more profoundly disturbing. "Two of the most banal words in any language are thus charged with (their own) absence, being emptied of absolute or referential sense as well as relative or contextual meanings" (78). I doubt many other readers would concur. The context of each use may be slippery, even ephemeral, but one can easily (unless, perhaps, one is Pascal) entertain the idea that something is big and small at the same time - because of course it is never the same time but two moments made almost to coincide by Voltaire's style. In any</page><page sequence="7">COLEMAN- VOLTAIRE S CONTES 177 case, there is no aporia here, no contradiction in the picture presented of the physical world. The sense data are not in doubt, nor are they themselves affected by the act of measurement. The reader may have to adjust psychologically to a new, unstable position, but this is an irony of application, not a deconstruction of meaning. In another place, Sherman points out quite correctly that Voltaire's is a "restrained" irony, local in scope, thereby suggesting it stands in contrast to the dizzying irony of the German Romantics. Why, then, does she exaggerate the deconstructive power of Micromégasì Part of the reason is that, despite her announced concern for readers' response to the text, Sherman tends to encapsulate that response in a sentence-by-sentence approach to the literary work. Larger units of meaning (except for those generated from outside by Proppian analysis), as well as the reader's inclination to go back over the text to see whether the forest has been obscured by the trees, are therefore slighted. I think this particularly damaging to an adequate reading of Voltaire. Take the example of the attack on Père Castel in chapter three of Micromégas. Here is Voltaire: En sortant de Jupiter, ils traversèrent un espace d'environ cent million de lieues, et ils côtoyèrent la planète de Mars, qui, comme on sait, est cinq fois plus petite que notre petit globe; ils virent deux lunes qui servent à cette planète, et qui ont échappé aux regards de nos astronomes. Je sais bien que le père Castel écrira, et même assez plaisamment, contre l'existence de ces deux lunes; mais je m'en rapporte à ceux qui raisonnent par analogie. Ces bons philosophes-là savent combien il serait difficile que Mars, qui est si loin du soleil, se passât à moins de deux lunes. Quoi qu'il en soit, nos gens . . . Here is Sherman's analysis: There is more than a trace of counter-text in the narrator's criticism of Castel's belief that Mars has no moons. In finding fault with the churchman, the narrating voice invokes comparative reasoning implying an inverse and approximate proportion - earth is to one moon as four-times-smaller Mars is to two - two moons being the given, the fact seen by the hero. The verity of this proportion is undermined by its being attributed to "ceux qui raisonnent par analogie." The next sentence also incriminates this reasoning even as it is used to mock Castel: "Ces bons philosophes-là savent combien il serait difficile que Mars, qui est si loin du soleil, se passât à moins de deux lunes." Of the two proportions offered to oppose him, one is inverse - the size of Mars (less) is in inverse proportion to the number of its moons (more) - and the other is direct- its distance from the sun (more than earth's) is directly proportional to the number of its moons (more than earth's). Besides having their origin in the anthropomorphic "needs" of the planet, their diverse theoretical expressions, direct and inverse, seem to contradict each other, for "those who reason by analogy" are needed to shore up the second proportion</page><page sequence="8">1 78 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ("ces philosophes-là") but "ceux qui" has often been used in the story to present a group for condemnation. (74-75) This passage is typical of Sherman's scrupulous effort to take Voltaire seriously, and, again, the stylistic remark on "ceux qui" is well-taken. But do her suspicions about analogical reasoning really apply? One needs to recall that Mars's moons, two small satellites, were discovered only in the nineteenth century. They had indeed "escaped the attention" of earlier astronomers, but not for lack of trying. Prescient though they may be, Voltaire's assertions are therefore gratuitous. The whole passage is placed in the realm of speculation, of idle talk. To claim, as Sherman does, that Voltaire illegitimately exploits analogical reasoning is true (and no doubt many examples of a slippage from verifiable observation to speculative guesses could be found in eighteenth- century science) but trivial in the context of the conte . Voltaire is simply enmeshing Castel in doubletalk. Castel becomes the unwitting straight man of a comic routine that forestalls argument with a blur of pseudo-logic. To answer back becomes ridiculous, even if you try to do so "assez plaisamment": spelling out the faulty inferences hurled at you only shows you didn't get the joke. Sherman's method for measuring the text's semiotic potential fails to accommodate this kind of rhetorical strategy, which depends on a constant interplay of text and referential context and includes linguistic features whose only real value appears when - if - the joke pays off. The brevity of the conte and the tightrope tension of Voltaire's style keep the text from being overburdened with such "secondary" material. One can, perhaps, ask however if the presence of elements meant to be sacrificed to a larger effect does not in some way detract from the integrity of the text. Integrity in the modern sense, though, because it is our esthetic that leads us to believe that not only does everything signify, but everything signifies in such a way that it must either support or undercut everything else. On the other hand, even those unwilling to subscribe to this aesthetic might find themselves defending Voltaire rather reluctantly given the "inconsistencies" (Cherpak) or contradictions of a discourse that does present itself as philosophical (Sherman). Is the only answer to make a virtue of necessity and praise the contes for their openness, for the way each tale "points to the vanity of mimetic privilege and insists on its own quality as sign" (278)?</page><page sequence="9">COLEMAN- VOLTAIRE S CONTES 179 While agreeing with Sherman's conclusion in the abstract, I cannot help feeling that it lets us off the interpretive hook too easily by blunting the specific quality of Voltaire's fiction. Perhaps it is banal, or thematically reductive, to recall the philosophers awareness of the limits of knowledge, but reading Voltaire also suggests we should question a mode of criticism that looks at texts solely in epistemological terms, as models for a theory of the world or of the sign. Not that the enterprise is illegitimate, but it misses an important part of what eighteenth- century philosophie was about. One might compare Sherman's criticism of the contes to Voltaire's own approach to theological texts. He could not help treating them as vehicles of some kind of knowledge (or important error, which is the same thing). Occasionally, and no doubt not often enough, he could find in them illustrations of the limits of all discourse. But he would also, and most memorably, sidestep the pursuit of knowledge in them in favor of a response rooted in healthy skepticism, unexamined prejudice, and stubborn fidelity to moral evidence. We may not want to follow Voltaire's example in our own critical endeavors. But an adequate account of his fiction should still retain the capacity to "sidestep" even the most rigorous of methods.
