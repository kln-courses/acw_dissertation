Reading this volume is an enlightening, enjoyable, and all too brief experience. Lisa Mighetto provides a fascinating intellectual history of American popular culture regarding wild animals. The lively text is illuminated by thirty-two pages of illustrations. John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, Jack London, Aldo Leopold, and a host of others are represented here, but the writers and advocates who are brought into clearest focus are the humanitarians, the intellectual forbears of contemporary animal rights activists. For Mighetto the story begins in earnest in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The pioneering science of Charles Darwin raised the uncomfortable specter that humans might well have more in com- mon with beasts than with gods. A new breed of nature writers responded with tales of exaggerated, exalted, and altogether anthropomorphic wild ani- mals, beasts capable of dignity, virtue, education, language, chivalry, marriage, and even surgery and salvation. In principle, the reduced status gap between hu- mans and animals might have made it easier to attribute value to animals in their own right, but early wildlife conservationists were anthropocentric and utilitarian in their approach. The sportsmen of the Boone and Crockett clubs were hunters eager to preserve their sport. The activists of the Audubon societies sought to preserve birds for human enjoy- ment. Exponents of the "new humanitarianism" departed from the purely anthropocentric view and focused attention on animal pain. The humanitarian impulse gave rise to organizations as various as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the First Church for Animal Rights and eventually manifested itself in antihunting, antitrapping, antivivisection, and vegetarian movements. Sympathy for sentient creatures did not extend to the predators, however, for "if humanitarians were to accept predators, they would have to accept also that the natural world does not conform to their values" (p. 83). A third approach to wildlife valuation emerged in the 1920s and 1930s. Biocentrism, as exemplified by Leopold's "land ethic," matured with the science of ecology. It valued all wildlife, including the nonsen- tient and the predator. Its concern for nature at large was expressed in its commitment to preserving spe- cies and natural systems, but, unlike humanitarian- ism, it showed little interest in alleviating the pain of individual animals. Neither humanitarianism nor bio- centrism has been able to establish dominance over persistent anthropocentrism, and American attitudes toward wild animals continue to reflect both conflict and cooperation among advocates of the three per- spectives. Mighetto's evaluation of the competing perspec- tives remains enigmatic. She is obviously taken with the humanitarians, comparing them to the signers of the Declaration of Independence and to abolitionists. It is equally clear that biocentrism has its appeal. Mighetto is especially reverential to Muir, whom she sees as combining the best features of humanitarian- ism and biocentrism. In the end she emphasizes the common thread: "For all their differences, both [hu- manitarianism and biocentrism] approach the animal world in a spirit of humility, thereby defying centu- ries of Western tradition" (p. 113). This break with tradition is praiseworthy because an appropriate ethic requires that we "accept animals for what they are rather than for what we would like them to be" (p. 118). CRAIG W.
