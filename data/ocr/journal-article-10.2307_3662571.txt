<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW While I can imagine a variety of potential audiences for this thought-provoking book, it might be especially useful for sparking debate amongst students taking courses in ancient religion or gender studies. University of Leeds EMMA J. STAFFORD V. KARAGEORGHIS: Greek Gods and Heroes in Ancient Cyprus. Pp. 334, map, 237 ills. Athens: Commercial Bank of Greece, 1998. Cased. ISBN: 960-7059-08-5. This is an exquisitely produced volume destined, with its large print, lavish photos, and glossy paper, for the intellectual coffee table. Commissioned by the Commercial Bank of Greece, the book sets out to provide a broad survey of Greek gods and heroes in ancient Cyprus for the general public, with an emphasis on the more accessible 'visual aspects of the evidence' (p. 10). K. is, of course, eminently qualified for such a task, with nearly forty years of published work on Cypriot archaeology, and he manages to convey a fair amount of scholarship despite the popular format, with frequent references to ancient literature and suggestions for further reading; a catalogue provides full details of the 237 illustrations. The book is arranged chronologically, beginning (pp. 15-35) with the earliest possible evidence for the 'immigration' of Greek mythology to Cyprus on imported Mycenaean pottery, followed by the first statues of anthropomorphic deities, which coincide with the arrival of Achaean settlers in the twelfth century B.C. The tenth to seventh centuries see the 'acclimatization' of many Greek gods and heroes in Cypriot art (pp. 37-63), under the combined influences of Greek epic poetry and Phoenician trade; representations of Herakles especially demonstrate the mingling of Greek, Egyptian, and Near Eastern stylistic traits in a developing Cypriot iconography. A central chapter covers the sixth to fourth centuries (pp. 65-159), a period K. characterizes as one of 'a revival of Greek consciousness' (p. 66) in the face of Persian domination, but also of some cultural assimilation with Phoenicia. Representations of Herakles again provide a case study, with an identifiable Cypriot type compared to a more strongly Greek-influenced variety; other familiar Greek gods and heroes appear in a wide variety of media, some pieces being associated with specific cult places, e.g. of Athena, identified with the Phoenician Anat, at Idalion. Also included in this chapter is a survey of Greek gods and heroes on Cypriot coinage down to the Roman period, with some very fine examples, especially from the Bank of Cyprus collection in Nicosia. The second half of the book (pp. 161-293) covers the Hellenistic and Roman periods, when Cypriot art was subject to the same cosmopolitan influences as the rest of the Mediterranean world. In addition to major deities (Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Aphrodite, Zeus, Hermes, Dionysos, Asklepios, Herakles), many minor deities are represented, including several personifications. A final section surveys Greek gods and heroes on mosaic floors, featuring some beautiful examples, especially from Nea Paphos. For the most part K. resists the temptation to make political capital out of the theme of the 'Greekness' of ancient Cypriot religion, though the wealth of material presented does go some way towards excusing his concluding flourish that the island experienced a 'final triumph of hellenization' (p. 297).

The Heritage of Greece: Ancient, Byzantine and Modern, the theme of a 1996-7 lecture series at Ball State University, is that which binds this very diverse collection of papers together. Of the ten contributors, only three, J. Griffin, M. Lefkowitz, and M. Mazower, actually presented their papers during the 1996-7 lecture series. The remaining contributions, delivered in previous years at Ball State, have been included because of their relevance to the theme. The editor, John A. Koumoulides, has divided the collection into four main sections: Ancient Greece, The Byzantine World, Greece in Transition, and Greece: The Modern Era. There is a short preface and the book is equipped with an index-one which, in evidence of the broad scope of this ? Classical Association, 2002 182</page></plain_text>
