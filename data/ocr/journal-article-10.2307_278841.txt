Three field parties from the University of Utah conducted archaeological research during the sum- mer of 1964. One of the parties, directed by Floyd W. Sharrock, excavated a site in the Green River Basin in the northeastern portion of the state. The site, near a high mountain spring, is believed to date from between 4000 and 2000 B.C. to the late prehistoric or historic period. Lower portions of the site produced lanceolate projectile points similar to those of the Middle period of the Northwestern Plains sequence. Upper levels had side-notched points. During a survey in Sweetwater and Uintah counties, sites of Renaud's Black Fork culture were examined and new sites located. A second University of Utah field party, under the direction of Mel Aikens, excavated a Fremont village known as the Snake Rock site. This site is on the eastern slope of the Wasatch Mountains some 70 mi. south of Price, Utah. By the middle of July, eight pit- houses, four surface houses, and four granaries had been excavated. The presence of at least six more structures was suspected. Architectural characteristics and ceramic design styles suggest that the Snake Rock site is the temporal equivalent of middle Developmental Pueblo. The third University of Utah field party, under the direction of J. Richard Ambler, excavated a Fremont village near the town of Lapoint in northern Utah. Labor was provided by the Ute tribe. The ten pithouses exca- vated by the first of August were circular, ranging from 13 to 19 ft. in diameter, and about 2 ft. deep. A central, clay-rimmed firepit and four roof supports were standard features, and several subfloor storage pits were found 371</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY in each structure. Seven burials, all interred carelessly and without artifacts, augment the still sparse skeletal sample from known Fremont sites. Artifactual material is typical northern Fremont. The few painted sherds are trade items. Albert H. Schroeder (National Park Service) con- ducted salvage excavations along a new road alignment at Natural Bridges National Monument. Two sites with contiguous, round-to-oval, slab-lined cists were exca- vated. Burned roof timbers and late Basketmaker III or Pueblo I sherds were recovered. Pollen material indi- cates a marginal pinyon-juniper environment in pre- historic times, in contrast to the present pinyon-juniper forest. NEW MEXICO. Herbert Dick (Fort Burgwin Research Center) continued excavations at Picuris Pueblo. In this fourth season of the project Dick was assisted by Dan Wolfman and Don Brown. The University of New Mexico Archaeological Field School, directed by Florence H. Ellis, excavated for the second season at the site of Sapawe about 60 mi. north- west of Santa Fe on one of the branches of the Chama River. Four small kivas and a great kiva have been trenched. Information obtained from these structures includes interesting variations on the underworld en- trance, typically located behind the fireplace. Some en- trances passed through pierced ceremonial stone bowls and cobble-lined trenches. Beneath one kiva fireplace, a deep ashpit yielded 46 cloudblowers of pottery and stone. More than 100 rooms have been excavated. Some of these contained almost no artifacts, while others yielded material items in quantity. Much but not all of Sapawe was destroyed by fire. The Pueblo people ap- parently burned their villages to prevent other groups from occupying their homes, obtaining their possessions, and practicing witchcraft. Pottery cross-dating indicates a span of occupation of from 50 to 75 years, beginning about A.D. 1475. This period of occupation would over- lap that of the Yunque-San Gabriel site (the first capital of New Mexico) at San Juan pueblo. The Department of Anthropology of the University of New Mexico is working on the problem of which of the modern Pueblo groups came from Mesa Verde and other areas of the Southwest. This archaeological, eth- nological, and linguistic study is part of the Wetherill Mesa Project. A significant result of this research is the discovery of a major prehistoric Anasazi shrine known as Shipap in the Four Corners area of Colorado. The shrine was utilized by the Acoma until just before 1900. COLORADO. At the Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project at Mesa Verde, analysis is well along on the ma- terials and information taken from sites excavated dur- ing the summer of 1963. The largest of these was Site 1676, a Pueblo I ruin, excavated by Alden C. Hayes and James A. Lancaster. Most of the two dozen short papers on various subjects that will be published by the Society for American Archaeology are being edited by the proj- ect's editor, Bernard Katz. Several monographs for the National Park Service Series are nearly complete or are being edited. Included are reports on Mug House, Badger House, and Big Juniper House. As far as the archaeological writing is concerned, the project is ex- pected to be finished by the summer of 1965. Ecological studies and the final report are expected to take an additional year. During the summer of 1964, Albert H. Schroeder and James A. Lancaster made test excavations at Yucca House in Yucca House National Monument. Of particu- lar interest were the presence of masonry walls built on fill material containing mud walls and the occurrence of mud wall melt to a depth of 7 ft., at which level timbers were encountered. A slab-paved floor was uncovered in one of the masonry rooms of the upper level. ARIZONA. National Park Service crews have completed salvage excavations along new road alignments at Wu- patki and Navajo National monuments. At Wupatki the excavations were directed by Don P. Morris. One small, square, partly subterranean masonry structure lacking floor features was excavated. Associated pottery indi- cates a date between A.D. 1100 and 1200. At Navajo National Monument Keith M. Anderson excavated a number of small pueblo structures of a few rooms each. Associated pottery dates to the 12th and early 13th centuries. A number of archaeological projects were conducted by staff members of the Museum of Northern Arizona during the 1964 field season. Between June 22 and July 3, 1964, A. J. Lindsay and W. C. Miller conducted a recon- naissance of Tyende Mesa and its major drainages, Perish Wash and Cutfoot Creek, on the Navajo Reservation. Seventy sites were recorded, all Kayenta Anasazi except one, which is a Hopi site. These sites have been tenta- tively assigned as follows: Basketmaker II (one site); Basketmaker III (4); Pueblo I (1); Pueblo II (37); Pueb- lo III (6); and Pueblo IV-V (1). Twenty sites have more than one component. Pueblo I and II sites are spread over the mesa and canyon, while most Pueb- lo III sites are in the canyons. This reconnaissance ties together the surveys conducted by the Museum of Northern Arizona in Utah and Arizona along the San Juan River and in Monument Valley to the east. In March of 1964 the Museum of Northern Arizona excavated a mass secondary burial on the Polacca Wash in northeastern Arizona. The skulls or skull fragments of at least 30 individuals had been placed in a circle approximately 4 ft. in diameter, and the remainder of the skeletons were placed within the circle. Associated ceramic materials suggest that the burial was made in the 11th century. In June, 1964, a Museum of Northern Arizona party, directed by Alan P. Olson, returned to Houck, Arizona, and excavated two pueblos comprising 25 rooms; six kivas, one of which was painted; two pithouses; a single room in a late Chacoan site; and 15 burials. The exca- vations contributed additional information on sites of the 12th and 13th centuries and pushed the terminal date for the Houck complex to nearly A.D. 1300. 372 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH The Museum of Northern Arizona continued its sur- vey of the American Telephone and Telegraph Coaxial Cable right-of-way. The initial site survey is completed, and the ditch is being checked as construction progresses. The Chicago Natural History Museum is continuing its efforts to synthesize the prehistoric cultural and social processes in east-central Arizona. This program, which is supported by the National Science Foundation, is under the direction of Paul S. Martin and James N. Hill. The excavation of Broken "K" site was reported in the "Current Research" section of American Antiquity, Vol. 30, No. 1, 1964. Since then, several major hypotheses have been confirmed. Hill has demonstrated statistically that there are three types of rooms at the site: habitation, storage, and ceremonial. Each of the types is localized in a particular area of the pueblo, and this may mean that different social groups were using them in slightly different ways. The classification was first established on the basis of the distribution of room features. It has been con- firmed by the differential distribution of pottery, stone, and bone artifacts, lithic waste, animal bones, and pollen. At least four social groups have been defined, each localized in one of the four wings of the pueblo. These groups were identified through analyses of distributions of animal bones and pottery types, as well as by archi- tectural evidence. They have been further confirmed by a factor analysis of pottery types, performed on the I.B.M. 7094 computer at the University of Chicago. It is ex- pected that a ceramic design-element analysis, similar to that done by Longacre (Science, Vol. 144, No. 3625, pp. 1454-55, 1964), will provide a further demonstration of these groupings and will permit identification of the population segments as matrilocal descent groups. There is also a dual division within the pueblo and evidence of economic reciprocity. Longacre, who analyzed independently all the tools from Broken "K," discovered that antler tines ("flakers") were found only in the east half, while arrowshaft straighteners were localized in the west half. This may indicate that arrowshafts were being made by one group, while the fine chipping of projectile points was done by the other. Architectural stratigraphy indicates at least two major periods of construction. Two groups of rooms in the south half of the pueblo were occupied first. These were followed by another group in the south half, and one in the north-central portion. Subsequent to this, the groups appear to have expanded toward one another, meeting at the four corners of the pueblo. The four primary room-groups coincide almost exactly with the loci of the social groups previously mentioned. Palynological evi- dence suggests that the postulated building sequence is correct. Those rooms which are architecturally earliest contain large amounts of pine pollen; the later ones con- tain nonarboreal pollen. This vegetational change is also indicated in the general pollen record for the area at this time period (Richard Hevly, Geochronology Lab- oratories, University of Arizona). Both palynological and tree-ring evidence suggest that an environmental shift was occurring at this time, and it is believed that corn agriculture was adversely affected. There is ample evidence that the inhabitants of Broken "K" were trying to adapt to this situation. Hevly has found that the later habitation rooms contain significantly less corn pollen than do the earlier ones, and corn seems to have been replaced by various local weed crops. The later storage rooms, on the other hand, contain high counts of both corn and weed pollen. This may mean that corn was not being consumed as food but rather conserved as seed corn. In conjunction with this, Hill has also discovered that the late portions of the site con- tained 40% more storage rooms and that there is pro- portionally more pottery in them. This rise suggests an increase in the utilization of storage vessels. Finally, the animal-bone distributions show that the latest inhabitants of the village were depending almost entirely on cotton- tail as a meat resource, in contrast to the earlier groups who relied more heavily on deer, mountain sheep, and jackrabbit. Longacre has suggested that, throughout the period from A.D. 1000 to 1300, the people in the Carter Ranch Valley were abandoning the numerous small pueblos in the area and that they were aggregating in the two latest and largest ones, Carter Ranch and Broken "K." This process of aggregation is believed to have necessi- tated the growth of institutional ties promoting an in- crease in intra-village social integration. Broken "K" is the largest pueblo in the valley and contains the largest number of localized social groups. It therefore appears outwardly to have achieved the highest degree of social integration. Further, it has been found that the people of the village were probably participating increas- ingly in extra-lineage or community-wide ritual. The earliest kivas appear to have been placed near localized social groups, while the latest one is more centrally lo- cated in the plaza. Near the end of the occupation all the kivas were abandoned, and there is no indication of the loci of ritual activity, unless it be the plaza. The dual division within the pueblo and its pattern of reciprocal economic exchange suggest that the mechanisms for so- cial integration were stronger at Broken "K" than they had been at Carter Ranch. Since the modern Western Pueblos are even more integrated internally, there is rea- son to believe that Broken "K" represents an intermediate stage in the evolution of Pueblo social organization. A new phase of research has now begun that will attempt to elucidate the earliest cultures in the Upper Little Colorado region. Particular emphasis is being placed on the adaptive evolution of social organization and on the transitional adaptation that probably occurred when agriculture was introduced. During the 1964 field season, a Desert Culture site 11 mi. east of Snowflake, Arizona, was excavated. The Department of Anthropology at Arizona State University is continuing its Hohokam archaeological proj- ect under the guidance of Reynold J. Ruppe, John C. Ives, and D. H. Morris. Financed by a National Science 373</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Foundation grant, it will continue through 1965. Excava- tions and surveys have produced important new data on the Hohokam. Sites of the Pioneer period of the Hohokam sequence in the Salt and Verde valleys have been tested. One of these sites, ASU U:10:2, is a single-component site, tentatively identified as Vahki phase because of the pres- ence of characteristic plain and red wares and the ab- sence of painted pottery. Tests at ASU U:9:28H have demonstrated the stratigraphic association of Snaketown and Gila Butte phase ceramic materials. At ASU U:5:3, a nonriverine Hohokam site, Colonial and Sedentary period ceramics have occurred in stratigraphic relation- ship to Snaketown phase ceramics. Both Vahki and Snaketown are Pioneer period phases. At least three other sites in the general vicinity of the confluence of the Salt and Verde rivers show Pioneer ceramics. It is evident that some provision must be made for elaboration of regional variations in the Hohokam cul- ture. It is presently possible to show that the Salt and Verde Pioneer sites differ in the following respects from the type site of Snaketown on the Gila River: (1) semi- flexed inhumations covered with rock cairns have been found at both ASU U:10:2 and ASU U:9:28H (no cremations have been uncovered although calcined bone is present); (2) if ASU U:10:2 can be assigned to the Vahki phase, the small size of the single house floor un- covered marks the house as clearly different from the large Vahki phase houses at Snaketown; and (3) the sites so far tested show good vertical accumulations of trash (mounding rather than thin sheet trash). Several large Colonial period sites have been located in addition to many smaller ones, and both canal systems and ball courts have been discovered. Some of these sites have one to five trash mounds; a few have from 20 to 40, and one site, which appears to be a single (primarily Santa Cruz) phase settlement boasts at least 100 trash mounds and three small ball courts. It can be shown from the position of the canals at the latter site that there are at least two canal systems which could have serviced about the same area. In some places their courses are very close to one another, but the bed of one is some 10 ft. above the other. Use of the higher canal may have destroyed remains of an earlier occupa- tion by irrigating land that had formerly been used for habitation. A few low, much silted, Snaketown-Gila Butte trash deposits lie within the field of irrigation of both canals. With National Science Foundation assistance, Vance Haynes and Paul Damon (University of Arizona Geo- chronology Laboratories) are conducting intensive geo- logical and radiocarbon chronological investigations of alluvial stratigraphic sequences pertinent to Early Man and to late Pleistocene extinction. Special efforts are being made to date by radiocarbon: (1) times of soil formation in relation to alluvial cutting and filling, (2) eolian facies, (3) any articulated mammoth remains that are in good stratigraphic context, and (4) any other strati- graphic sequence of paleoclimatic significance. These investigations are being undertaken in close cooperation with archaeologists, paleontologists, and palynologists. From March 2 through May 15, 1964, William W. Wasley (Arizona State Museum) directed the excava- tion and restoration of the "Fortified Hill" site, Arizona T:13:8, on the Gila Bend Indian Reservation near Gila Bend, Arizona. Cameron Greenleaf served as field assist- ant, and up to 17 Papago Indians provided the labor. The project was made possible by a National Science Founda- tion grant. The restoration was accomplished in antici- pation of the establishment of a public park on the reser- vation through the cooperation of the Papago Tribal Council and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The site is on a detached section of a volcanic escarpment just north of the Gila River and approximately 6 mi. north- west of the town of Gila Bend. The uplift rises sharply from the first terrace of the Gila River, so that at the east end it attains an elevation of approximately 200 ft. The most prominent feature, from which the site received its popular name, is a large wall of dry-laid masonry that divides the top of the escarpment into an upper and lower village. The wall runs north-south and has an offset gate in the center. The base and footings range from 1.5 to 2 m. in width, and the maximum height is 2.5 m. At least 51 houses or rooms were discovered in the two sections on top. Six homes were found in or near rock shelters above the talus slope on the south side. Of the 43 houses that were excavated, 39 were partially restored. Rock shelters are present on all exposed sides of the site. Two walled caves remain in good condition. Rubble-core masonry was used throughout, except for two rooms in which the walls were constructed of stone- reinforced adobe. Most doorways opened to the east. Floor features included hearths and postholes. Crema- tion areas were found on the south side of the hill along an arroyo. The larger contained 11 primary cremations, and the smaller, two. These primary cremations were long, oval pits over which the deceased had been laid. The remains were left in place after the collapse of the bier or were scraped up to the head (east) end and covered with a bowl or placed in a jar with a bowl cover- ing. Temporal estimates for the occupation of the site, based on pottery cross-dating, are A.D. 1100 to 1300. An important discovery, incidental to the work at the "Fortified Hill" site, was a series of clay quarries above the talus slope of the escarpment. Piles of broken rock, the matrix which had enclosed the clay lenses, were associated with a wide range of river cobbles and large flake knives, apparently the tools used for the extraction of the clay. ALFRED E. JOHNSON SOUTHEASTERN MESOAMERICA The Brigham Young University-New World Archaeo- logical Foundation has continued its laboratory and pub- lication program through the 1964 season. The excava- tions at Izapa from January through May, 1964, were under the supervision of Gareth W. Lowe and his 374 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH assistant field director, Thomas A. Lee, Jr. Topography and architectural investigations were carried out by Eduardo Martinez E. The 1964 excavations at Izapa concentrated on the earliest and latest known complexes of the site, Groups B and F, respectively, following Stirling's nomenclature of the stone-monument groupings. The principal com- ponent of Group B is the great Mound 30 platform and 30a pyramid described previously (American An- tiquity, Current Research, Vol. 29, No. 3). A new trench was dug through the eastern half of the pyramidal mound, this time to sterile depth, and this showed that the complex began on a slight natural rise. Neither sherds nor additional radiocarbon dates have yet been processed, but the obvious relative uniformity of the ceramics leaves no question but that the series of super- imposed truncated pyramids will antedate the 700 B.C. date secured last year from the summit of the latest of the Middle Preclassic structures. An approximate equivalency with Conchas 1 of the La Victoria sequence is suspected for the architecture, though earlier sherds seem common in the fill. Another trench, which was begun on the southern (front) face of Mound 30a, en- countered the same architectural sequence with addi- tional details; this frontal trench will be completed to sterile depth and farther into the pyramid hearting during 1965. The exploration and reconstruction of Izapa Group F was nearly completed in 1964. This is a compact, primarily Late Classic assemblage of platforms, a ball court, and a pyramid astride the highway to Guatemala. The group is being restored as part of a joint venture with the Mexican government and is designed to make Izapa accessible and understandable as an archaeological zone of both local and international importance. The substructures are all faced with river boulders, though stairways are largely made of well-squared stones appar- ently re-used from earlier constructions. The central platform and pyramid cover an earlier complex from which an additional score of caches of a local Early Classic style were recovered this year. The present col- lection of over 500 restored vessels from Group F will form the core of the Early and Late Classic and Early Postclassic ceramic typology for Izapa. The earlier periods are represented by a greater quantity of fragmentary ma- terial from the central Groups A and B, where investiga- tions will be concluded during a brief 1965 season. Several new stone monuments were discovered at Izapa during the investigation of the Group F ball court. All are broken and reset; they seem to be of the typical Izapan sculptural style, thought to be Late Preclassic and Protoclassic. As with all known Izapa sculpture, there are no numerals or calendrical glyphs. The laboratories are now in Tuxtla Gutierrez and are associated with the Chiapas Regional Museum. An effort is being made to complete and publish reports on a large backlog of material. J. Alden Mason continues to edit the Foundation series of papers. Paper 15, "Some Ce- ramics from Mirador, Chiapas," by Frederick Peterson, was published recently. Soon to be distributed is Paper 16, "The Archaeological Burials of Chiapa de Corzo and Their Furniture," by Pierre Agrinier. In press are Papers 17 and 18, "Excavations at Santa Rosa, Chiapas," and "An Archaeological Reconnaissance in the Southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec," both by Agustin Delgado. In advanced state of preparation is T. A. Lee's "The Arti- facts of Chiapa de Corzo." Dee F. Green has completed a manuscript reporting test excavations at the Middle Preclassic village sites of Altamira and Padre Piedra, Chiapas. Bruce W. Warren continues his analysis of the Chiapa de Corzo ceramics, having incorporated for comparative and typological purposes all available central Chiapas pottery. The chronological and spatial distribu- tions of approximately 100,000 sherds and 3000 whole vessels are being plotted by advanced computer methods. Close to 200 types with their varieties have been identi- fied and named. It is hoped that the manuscript report- ing these data will be completed and published during the coming year. Further reconnaissance in the Soconusco region was made by Carlos Navarrete during May, primarily in an effort to determine the cultural affiliations of principal mound sites and their possible relationship to Izapa. The survey will be completed and published in 1965. No other site known on the southwestern coast and pene- plain of Chiapas has a size or ceremonial structuring comparable to that of Izapa, although there are many sites of medium extent. Except for Izapa, stone sculp- ture is rare and restricted to isolated finds, but many sites show parallel development ceramically. An attempt may be made to isolate and test a number of zones which demonstrate "single phase" occupations in the hope of perfecting the present lengthy but somewhat poorly defined Izapa ceramic sequence. Of particular interest are several early estuary sites of Early and Middle Preclassic dates which appear to compare well with those of La Victoria and Salinas already investigated by M. D. Coe in the adjoining Guatemalan sector of the Soco- nusco coast. The Iximche Project, directed by George F. Guillemin, is currently sponsored by the National Swiss Foundation for Scientific Research. The 1964 program at this site was devoted to excavations in and about Plaza C. About the size of A Group, this plaza contains a ball court, two temple mounds, and a number of house structures. From prior excavation of Plazas A and B, it was evi- dent that each ceremonial court and its surrounding buildings actually formed a clearly delimited group. The Plaza C group is especially distinct and is isolated from the neighboring B Group by thick stone walls which impede direct communication between the two. The reasons for this masonry obstacle are not clear; possibly it served a religious end or was a defensive device. The whole northeastern side of Plaza C is occupied by Struc- ture 38, a platform (68 m. in length) sustaining three houses, each provided with its own stairway. The south- ern house unit is the largest of the three and is closest to temple Structure 5. Ceramics found with the houses 375</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY are predominantly domestic; ceremonial pottery includes a broken effigy censer representing Tlaloc, the whole stylistically relating to Cakchiquel cylindrical censers. The persistence of a Tlaloc "cult" at this site is indi- cated by an identifiable Tlaloc on a purple-on-red Pre- classic type of pottery here. Temple Structure 5 was partly exposed and shows at least two construction phases. Although the substructure, or pyramid, has a single central stairway, the final access to the actual temple platform is a double stairway. The southwestern portion of Plaza C was discovered to be bordered by house structures that faced away from the plaza onto a previously unmapped court. This adjacent court is sur- rounded by six house platforms and temple Structure 6. The latter was found not to be connected with the ball court Structure 7 as had been supposed previously. Three exterior sides of the ball court have been exposed to date. Projecting stairways occur at both enclosed ends, while an additional narrow stairway exists at the southwestern corner of the eastern part of the ball court. A human- head marker of stone with a tenon was found else- where with C Group but may have belonged originally to the ball court. Temple Structure 4, on the north- western side of the Plaza, was peripherally explored. Re- mains of a small feature, Structure 98, were found at the southwestern corner of Structure 4, while the area im- mediately west of Structure 4 was found to be paved with human skulls. The presence of cervical vertebrae indi- cates decapitation. These may comprise ritual offerings, since most of the 48 skulls were accompanied by obsidian blades. A number of the skulls had been buried in small lots, while the rest were set individually in pits cut into the Plaza floor. This material comprises an excellent series for study, particularly with regard to cranial de- formation. Three small units, probably altars, were found on the Plaza floor next to Structure 98. Two frag- ments of probable Preclassic stone sculpture were en- countered this season: one apparently comes from the fill of Structure 7 and is of the "man seated on bench" type; the other, found between Structures 4 and 49, is a pregnant pisote, damaged and subsequently retouched, possibly at the time of re-use by Cakchiquel. All in all, the 1964 Plaza C excavations did much to illustrate the diversity and complexity of group composition within the central portion of this major protohistoric site. Fur- ther excavations at Iximche, though on a reduced scale, are scheduled for the next two years. One of the least-known archaeological areas in Meso- america is Lake Izabel, Guatemala, despite its strategic location in the Maya lowlands between the Peten and the southwestern sites of Quirigua and Copan. However, for the past two years there has been a long-term project at the lake, concerned with land-use patterns and human ecology, under the direction of Hugh Popenoe (Univer- sity of Florida). At the invitation of Popenoe, and supported by his proj- ect, a survey was begun in June, 1964, of the archaeo- logical resources of the area, under the direction of Michael D. Coe (Yale University). Assisting him was Barbara Denton, a graduate student at Yale, who will remain at the lake until the end of the summer. The actual area covered extends from the lower Rio Polochic to the mouth of the Rio Dulce at Livingston. Because of the size of the territory involved, it is planned to com- plete the reconnaissance during the summer of 1965. In the immediate vicinity of Lake Izabel, Golfete, and the Rio Dulce, large sites are less numerous than one would expect, but the surface materials collected indi- cate an occupation from the Middle Preclassic through the Spanish Colonial periods. The major site is at the Castillo San Felipe, strategically located on a peninsula at the exit of the lake into the Rio Dulce. The entire peninsula is covered with mounds, some around plazas, while the surface sherds and figurines (other than Colon- ial Spanish artifacts) indicate a major occupation during the Protoclassic and a less intense one in the Preclassic. Village sites are fairly numerous around the lake shore, most of them being of Early or Late Classic date. No Classic ceremonial centers have been found thus far right on the lake, but such do exist on ridges along the upper reaches of the tributary streams that feed into the lake and into Golfete. They are characterized by Peten- style cut-stone masonry. A major ceremonial center site with monuments is reported to lie between the south- western corner of Lake Izabel and the Rio Motagua. A proposed large-scale archaeological project in the Izabel area is expected to offer a unique opportunity to correlate studies of tropical-forest ecology and land use with archaeological data on settlement patterns, demography, and cultural development. Accompanying the archae- ologists was Matsuo Tsukada (Yale University), who made a number of pollen borings in Lake Izabel and in Golfete. The cores are now being analyzed in an effort to establish a sequence of vegetational changes in the area. Peten archaeological exploration has been advanced notably during the past five years by Ian Graham of Suffolk, England. Since July, 1959, Graham has visited Aguateca several times to map the site and to record sculpture. Aguateca is a small site near the edge of an escarpment just south of Lake Petexbatun, where five mounds surround a plaza. There are five carved stelae in fair or good condition and five others that are badly eroded or fragmented. One stela is plain, and two others are of uncertain classification. Dedicatory dates lie between 9.13.0.0.0 and 9.18.0.0.0. Stela 2 (9.15.5.0.0) is remarkable for its close resemblance to Stela 16 at nearby Dos Pilas, both in structure of recorded dates and in presentation of the warrior figure. A causeway runs 200 m. north-northeast to a group of low mounds, and it may extend still farther in the same direction. A strik- ing feature of the site is the natural chasm between the escarpment and the plaza. The chasm is very deep and is spanned by a number of natural bridges. All but one of these appear to have been blocked by stone walls; if these were defensive works, the site would have been well protected against attack from the east. 376 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH In northeastern Peten, about 15 km. from the Mexi- can-British Honduras border, a fairly large site was hastily mapped and given the name Kinal. Except for a few house mounds, all the structures lie close to a broad causeway that extends from a terraced plaza south- westward for about 2 km. before disappearing into a bajo. Here a possible ball court and four pyramids occur, one of the latter incorporated into a very large acropolis. The acropolis, one corner of which overlaps the cause- way, covers an area of about 1.8 hectares (4.5 acres), or 2.5 hectares (6.2 acres), if a contiguous terrace and build- ings are included. This acropolis consists of 12 closed courts at various levels surrounded by single or double rows of vaulted chambers, some of which still stand. One court is connected with two others by vaulted tunnels. The predominant masonry consists of unsorted blocks. No stone monuments were found. Partial re- moval of rock fill from one chamber revealed a graffito of at least two figures about two-thirds life-size, each with a glyph near the head. Farther to the west in this part of Peten are four sites with mounds tall enough to be visible from the air. The largest of these, Mirador, lies north of Carmelita and is connected by causeways running about 25 km. south-southwest and 13 km. southeast to two of the others. Of the latter, the first was not visited, but the second, which has been named Nakbe, was mapped, as was Mirador. Mirador is a site of the first magnitude. Ruppert and Denison, who were able to spend only a few hours in the eastern part of it more than 30 years ago, do not seem to have been aware of its great size. The group they saw is dominated by a great acropolis at the top of a hill, but on a plateau to the west there are several others. There is also a very large pyramid which occupies an area of 1.5 hectares and rises from flat ground to a height of 55 m. Originally the struc- ture was still higher, since the building which presumably stood on its top has completely disappeared. A charac- teristic feature of man of the larger mounds is a terrace about two-thirds of the way up which may extend some distance to each side as wings that are surmounted by small mounds at their extremities. The scanty remains of masonry show very large blocks, with cornice stones of exceptional size, sometimes carved with raindrops. A clue to the advanced state of ruin here may lie in the apparent mixture of bajo mud and mortar. Only one stela was found, poorly shaped and probably un- carved. A very tall pyramid and similar mounds exist at Nakbe, but no stelae were found. In southern Peten, due west of Poptun and about two-thirds the distance from Poptun to the Rio Pasion, is a site which has been named Machaquila since it lies on the banks of the Machaquila or Santa Amelia River. A compact site, covering an area of about 200 by 300 m., it comprises some 50 structures disposed irregularly but defining four or more courts or plazas. Part of one vaulted temple remains standing to within one course of the capstones. Vaultstones, remarkable for their ex- ceptionally long tenons, lie among the debris of other collapsed buildings. A palace-type building has walls covered by short-tenoned veneer masonry of outstanding quality. Sixteen of the 17 stelae were found along two sides of the main plaza. Twelve of these are carved, two are plain, and the remaining stelae, which were appar- ently of small size and inferior stone, are largely de- composed. The earliest surviving Dedicatory date is 9.14.0.0.0; the latest, 10.0.10.0.0. Surface sherds indicate considerable activity since Preclassic times. A carved table altar supported on four cylindrical legs stands in this plaza. Elsewhere, an otherwise insignificant mound is the locus of a number of stones finely carved with hieroglyphs, probably from a stairway or step. The front corners of the substructure, or possibly of the building itself, were rounded, each bearing a cartouche contain- ing four glyphs, a hint that this structure may have marked the end of a katun, as at Quirigua. A brief report illustrating some of the Machaquila finds appeared recently in Expedition (Vol. 5, No. 4, Philadelphia). The Royal Ontario Museum excavation program in British Honduras is under the direction of David M. Pendergast. Rockstone Pond, north of Belize, was selected for excavation. By April, 1964, Pendergast, assisted by David Baxter, had managed (1) to complete excavation of one structure started in September, 1963, (2) to clear the major portion of one of the larger structures facing one of two central plazas, (3) to excavate nearly all of a range structure bordering the second plaza, and (4) to finish three tombs, which were the high points of the year. These last are not vaulted tombs but crypts con- structed of rubble masonry walls, unplastered, and roofed with large rough slabs of flint. Despite the unpre- possessing nature of these crypts, the contents have proved to be quite spectacular, including among other things a group of huge eccentric flints from each grave, 21 in two instances and 20 in the third, with human and animal figures, discs, crescents, and other forms among them. A number of restorable vessels were in each grave, as well as jade necklaces. From the first grave the expedition additionally recovered a mass of pearls drilled as beads, a necklace of 85 disc beads cut from heavy shell and painted red, a pack of polished inlay elements of pyrite, some of these in the shape of Maya profiles, and a very interesting kneeling human figurine reminiscent of certain Olmec pieces. While most of the material recovered so far at this site is Classic, covering at least early Tzakol to some point in Tepeu times, the test work done in the fall of 1963 yielded a small amount of ceramic material from an unmixed deposit that is clearly Preclassic. There are some ceramic links between Rockstone Pond and Thompson's San Jose, but the se- quence from the latter does not wholly fit the situation at Rockstone Pond. It is already evident that current notions of the Belize coastal strip as a backwash, where developments were belated and generally unimpressive, will have to be revised. In 1964, the Peabody Museum of Harvard University carried on its first of four field seasons at the ruins of Siebal in southern Peten. The staff consisted of Cordon 377</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY R. Willey and A. Ledyard Smith, assisted by Gair Tour- tellot, Ian Graham, and Timothy Fiske. Willey, assisted by Tourtellot, spent seven weeks at Altar studying the artifacts and figurines recovered during the excavations of the past season. Graham, who arrived at the end of February, was in Seibal for two months making a map of the principal groups of the site. He was assisted by Fiske in March and Tourtellot in April. In March, John Graham (University of California) spent a few days at Seibal studying and photographing the monuments. He plans to return in 1965 for several weeks to continue his hieroglyphic studies. The ruins of Seibal rest on several steep hills on the left bank of the Pasion River, 16 km. above the village of Sayaxche. The site lies a short distance from the great bend in the river. By boat this is roughly 109 km. upstream from Altar de Sacrificios. The site was pre- sumably discovered around 1890 by a mahogany-cutter. In 1892, the Guatemalan government sent an expedition to Seibal to obtain material for the Guatemalan Exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Casts of some of the finest stelae were displayed at the Exposi- tion in 1893 and brought the attention of archaeologists for the first time to Seibal. Teobert Maler visited Seibal in 1895 and in 1905. In 1914 and 1915, Sylvanus Morley made brief trips to Seibal. In 1961, two trips were made to the site by members of the Peabody Museum's Altar de Sacrificios expedition. The results of these trips, a preliminary map and ceramic sequence, have been pub- lished by R. E. W. Adams (Estudios de Cultura Maya, Vol. 3). In 1963, Seibal was again visited by members of the Altar de Sacrificios expedition. The purpose of this trip was to decide on camp location and make arrangements for the construction of a 4-km. truck road from the Monteria of Seibal to the ruins. Ian Graham made a thorough survey of Seibal and soon discovered that it was over twice as large as had originally been thought. Time allowed the mapping of only the main groups, with their buildings and monu- ments and the causeways joining them. These were Groups A, C, and D. Group B, an isolated group about 3 km. south-southeast of Group A, discovered by Mor- ley in 1915, and consisting of a single monument, Stela 12, on the east side of a pyramid, was not included on the map. Groups A, C, and D occupy different hills and are separated by valleys. A system of causeways running east and west and north and south, numbered I, II, and III, connects these groups. Causeway I runs eastward from Group A, along a ridge, to a point about midway between Groups A and D. Here it ends in a small court or terrace, which is in fact the juncture of all three causeways. From this court, Causeway III con- tinues on to the east to Group D, and Causeway II goes south to Group C. This meeting point of the causeways must have been considered a place of great importance for here were erected three carved monuments. Cause- way II, leading south to Group C, follows along a ridge between Groups A and D and terminates in front of a mound with a carved altar. This is the southern extent of Group C. Most of the rest of the group, except for a few mounds to the east, extend along the west side of Causeway II on the same ridge. Group A, although not the largest, was probably the most important part of Seibal. At least during the latter part of the occupation, most of the sculptured stelae, 15 of 19, were erected here. It has over 30 mounds or building platforms, most of which are arranged around two plazas. The largest and highest of the site, Struc- ture 9, rising to 28 m., is a temple-type pyramid on the southern plaza which has one plain and two carved stelae. On the opposite side of the plaza from Structure 9 are Structures 1 and 2 and a handsome new monu- ment, Stela 19, discovered by Ian Graham during the mapping. John A. Graham, the expedition epigrapher, has placed Stela 19 as Late Classic, probably at the 10.1.0.0.0 Katun ending. The figure on the monument has several non-Maya elements. The face is partially covered by a bird-beak mask, presumably representing Quetzalcoatl-Ehecatl, and a speech scroll curls out of the mouth. The individual appears to be sowing corn or some other seeds. Structure 2, adjacent to Structure 1, is a large, low platform with Stelae 2 and 3 standing in front. On the west side of the southern plaza is Struc- ture 3, a small pyramid topped by the remains of a temple with a corbeled vault. Four monuments, Stelae 8 through 11, are associated with Structure 3, one on each side in a basal central position. Structures 10 and 11, forming a long, low platform, separate the southern and northern plazas of Group A. The handsome Stela 1 lies just south of them in the southern plaza. Struc- ture 13 is the highest pyramidal mound in the northern plaza. It has Stelae 5, 6, and 7 set along its base on the plaza side. Structure 14, north of and adjoining Struc- ture 13, once supported a double row of rooms at its summit. At its base a large portion of a hieroglyphic step is exposed, part of which was found during the 1964 clearing. On the west side of the north plaza is Structure 20, a pyramidal mound facing east on the plaza with a monument, Stela 18, on a low terrace on its east side. A long platform on the north side of Struc- ture 20 forms one of the ranges of what appears to be a large ball court. The numeration of buildings in Group A follows that used by Adams in his preliminary map. Group C has most of its mounds along the west edge of Causeway II. It is smaller than Group A, having about 25 mounds. As in the case of Group A, there are two main plaza areas. Both are bordered by mounds. Be- tween these two plazas is a normal-sized, open-end ball court with its long axis lying east and west. South of the southern plaza is a small group of mounds partially enclosing a small court. Causeway II takes a curve to the southeast before it ends at a terrace or court sup-. porting the building with the carved altar in front. A carved jaguar head protrudes from one side of this altar, which was apparently supported by four legs shaped to represent human-like figures. Group D, at the east end of Causeway III, is the largest group at the site and has about 50 structures. 378 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH Although the largest, it evidently was not as important as Group A, for only one monument has been found, a plain stela. Causeway III passes through the group; most of the mounds lie south of it. There are at least six plazas in Group D with buildings facing on them. Cause- way III ends at the easternmost plaza. One plaza lies to the north of the causeway, the rest to the south. There are also several courts south of the causeway. All these plazas and courts are closely associated, often having the same building in common. One of the largest plazas has a terraced temple mound 20 m. high. This is the mound fronted by the plain stela. The remains of what may have been a vaulted building are on top of the mound. Although the principal groups and their build- ings have been mapped, there is still much to be done to complete the site map. Ian Graham will return in 1965 to finish the job. During the mapping of Seibal, outlying mounds (not placed on the map) were found as well as areas with evidences of house mounds. Small groups of mounds at some distance from the main site were reported. One of these, San Martin, was visited. It consisted of two large mounds about 13 m. high, plus several smaller mounds. No ceramic testing was done during this first field sea- son at Seibal. However, the earlier work of Adams pro- vides a sequence which runs from a Mamom-equivalent phase of the Middle Preclassic period, through a Tzakol 2 complex, and finally terminates in a Tepeu 3 horizon. Thus a long chronological span is represented at Seibal. Whether the indicated intervening phases, following the models of the Uaxactun and Altar de Sacrificios se- quences, are represented remains to be determined by future work. The preliminary studies at Seibal and the data on the archaeology of the Pasion drainage obtained from work at Altar de Sacrificios and environs suggest that those ruins may hold the solutions to several problems. Among these are questions about non-Maya, presumably Mexi- can, influences on the Peten Maya at the close of the Late Classic period. At Altar de Sacrificios these influ- ences begin to appear in ceramics at a time thought to be the approximate equivalent of the Tepeu 3 (or ter- minal Late Classic) phase at Uaxactun. This is the Boca phase at Altar de Sacrificios, and it is believed to have dated from the Maya Katun endings of 9.17.0.0.0 to 10.3.0.0.0, or from A.D. 771 to 889 (Goodman-Mar- tinez-Thompson correlation). At first these changes blend into the older resident traditions, but later, in perhaps the century following A.D. 889, change is more abrupt. This final period of occupation at Altar de Sacrificios, called Jimba, seems to have been one of actual invasion of the site by non-Mayan or at least not classic Mayan people. New pottery types appear. These are in the fine-paste traditions which were represented in some of the nonutilitarian forms in the preceding Boca phase. In Jimba, however, the Fine Orange and Fine Gray wares predominate in utility as well as nonutilitarian types. The particular kind of Fine Orange ware involved is the Y type. In addition, characteristic Maya figurines tend to be replaced by Fine Orange paste figurines which depict individuals of a straight-nosed, strong-jawed, non- Maya physical type. There is thus at Altar de Sacrificios a hint of a conquest of an important western border Peten Classic site by a non-Maya people around A.D. 900. At Seibal many of the stelae reflect remarkably strong non-Maya, Mexican influence. Some stelae show hiero- glyphs which are in a Mexican rather than Mayan genre. The priests or dignitaries depicted are as non-Maya and as Mexican-like as the physical types shown in the Jimba figurines at Altar de Sacrificios. Certainly the Seibal speech scrolls, naturalistic serpent representations, Tlaloc faces, and Quetzalcoatl-Ehecatl god representations are all foreign to antecedent Maya artistic tradition. How- ever, in spite of these non-Mayan features at Seibal, the Jimba-phase ceramics have not yet been found in the preliminary tests made at the site by Adams. The monu- ments at Seibal, on which the various Mexicanoid ele- ments are seen, are dated within the range of 9.16.0.0.0 and 10.2.0.0.0, that is, A.D. 751 and 869. They are thus largely later than the Initial Series monuments at Altar. Although there are many complications and points not yet fully clarified, the evidence seems overwhelm- ingly strong that an important current of influence was impinging upon Altar de Sacrificios, the Pasion Valley, and Seibal in the final decades of the Maya Classic. The Initial Series dates and the respective histories of Altar de Sacrificios and Seibal strongly suggest that Altar flourished in the Early Classic and in the Late Classic until 9.17.0.0.0 and was a leading ceremonial center in the southwestern Peten throughout these times. Seibal, on the other hand, although occupied as a minor site from Middle Preclassic forward, seems not to have been of great ceremonial importance until 9.16.0.0.0 and after. Whether or not there were major pyramidal construc- tions there before that time is unknown. Determination of this is one of the tasks to be undertaken. The comple- mentary pattern of the stela dates argues for a west-to- east shift in authority and power. When Altar de- clined, Seibal rose. Was this transfer and the rise of Seibal something that was accomplished by the old resi- dent Maya? Or was the new "capital" of Seibal the seat of invaders? Seibal art still has many Maya features, and monuments which are fully contemporaneous bear, respectively, Mayan and "Mexicanoid" figures. What- ever the history of the leaders of Seibal may have been, their culture was fully a blend of Mayan traditions with the noted foreign admixture. Future work at Seibal should throw considerable light on this acculturation. At Tikal, in northern Peten, Guatemala, a ninth sea- son of excavation and study began in January, 1964, and continues at the time of writing (August, 1964). The results of this work by the University Museum, Phila- delphia, confirm the difficulty of achieving a sense of "adequate sample" at this huge, complex site. The early phases of the North Acropolis were further exposed in 1964 by William Coe prior to the arduous 379</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY filling of the immense trench excavated over the past five years. Lateral tunnels were dug off the trench to expose critical details of early acropoli dating from the last two centuries B.C. One result of this work was the discovery of an anticipated asymmetrical arrangement of structures on these successive Preclassic Acropolis platforms. For instance, Structure 5D-Sub.1, discovered in 1960, is a rear-central, south-oriented, temple-type building. What appears to have been its twin and surely contemporary was discovered in tunneling this year just to the southeast. Yet no balancing temple occurs to the west. Of particular interest was the existence in front of this west-oriented temple of a small shrine-type build- ing whose exterior had been brilliantly decorated with polychrome frescos. This west-oriented shrine consisted of a two-level building platform, on the upper level of which had been erected a miniscule building, interiorly smoke-blackened, with a single room. The exterior of the building, both sides and rear with rear-outset, were originally decorated by six standing, heavily orna- mented individuals (an Akbal glyph had been incor- porated in one headdress) painted in black, red, pink, and yellow. The anciently mutilated remains of four were exposed in tunneling. These figures were linked by geometric decorative bands paralleling the underside of the painted and modeled stuccoed medial cornice or upper zone. Underlying this shrine was a vaulted tomb which had actually been intruded into a prior building. The tomb, or Burial 167, and the painted shrine were essentially coeval. This burial contained three indi- viduals: an extended adult on whose chest area and pelvis had been arranged two large lidded bowls, one containing the disarticulated remains of a second adult, the other the extended skeleton of an extremely young infant, if not a still-born. The remains await competent study. Oddly, the calvaria of both adults were greatly thickened, suggesting a pathological link between the two. The vaulted chamber contained many pottery ves- sels in addition to those containing human remains. One vessel was a geometrically painted urn, done in cream, green, and pink; remains of two stuccoed and painted gourds were also recovered. The main individual wore fully reconstructable wide bracelets of minute shell beads with bone hasps perforated to sustain the strands. Other items with the principal include sting-ray spines, a shell-bead necklace with two anthropomorphic shell pendants, and a greenstone statuette very much like the squatting type so common in the Quiche area of the highlands. Burial 167 can be related to Burial 85, found in 1962, in terms of the Acropolis floor sequence (Expedi- tion, Vol. 5, No. 2). Burial 85 is perhaps only a few years younger than Burial 167. Both vaulted tombs pro- duce key ceramic elements of the Cuac ceramic com- plex, about A.D. 1. A third vaulted tomb from these times, Burial 166, was also found in 1964. This burial was perhaps 50 years older than Burial 167. It was found accidentally in tunneling to explore the considerably earlier and deeper first major Acropolis platform. The burial was southwest of Structure 5DSub.1 in an area of small temple platforms. One of these platforms oriented north. Burial 166 had been cut down into the Acropolis and had been immediately sealed by the first of these platforms. Sharing the vault with Burials 167 and 85, it was marked by red plastered walls on which had been painted six black human figures. The chamber floor was occupied by an extended adult with an origin- ally seated second person at his feet. The principal was laterally flanked by a large group of pottery vessels, again of the Cauac complex. A cave-in halted further work. Attention was then shifted to later Acropolis levels that produced architecture correlated with weakly represented Protoclassic ceramics (Cimi ceramic complex). Further knowledge of coeval architecture was gained, corrobo- rating the persistence of Acropolis building traditions despite what amounts to a negligible influx of presum- ably foreign ceramic elements. A worthwhile project, perhaps for another institution, would be thorough tun- neling of the entire Acropolis. This complex has been only partially "mined" by the Tikal Project. Neverthe- less, this work has already expanded knowledge of the Preclassic central Peten culture sequence, especially in various important categories, such as tombs and shrine paintings. Basic ignorance of the surface stage of the large East Plaza east of Temple I was offset by Christopher Jones's excavations in 1964. Platform 5E-1, supporting mounds labeled on the Tikal map as Structures 5E-23 through 26, was sufficiently tested to indicate that the whole feature is incomplete, as previously anticipated. The mounds on top are not structures but blocks of fill of an incomplete construction stage. The west base of this square plat- form was occupied by a long, single-range building of Late Classic age. Although construction was still pro- ceeding, one building had already been completed. Possi- bly the architects had in mind a huge platform, whose sides were to be covered by tiers of palace-type buildings. Whatever the original plans may have been, the project was clearly abandoned. Various lines of reasoning point to collapse of this architectural effort at Tikal sometime shortly after 10.2.0.0.0. However, no Late Classic fill sherds have yet been recovered to sustain this interpre- tation. As part of the East Plaza investigations, atten- tion was also given to Structure 5E-32 and related build- ings. This very large complex consisted of four mounds rectangularly arranged, with closed corners, within which were four more long mounds, also arranged rectangu- larly, but with open corners. Entirely Late Classic, these mounds were found to be made up of long, vaulted galleries without benches, cordholders, or other charac- teristics of Late Classic Tikal "palaces." The outer quadrangle consisted of outward-oriented buildings. Par- allel galleries were added that overlooked the court. All vaults had collapsed, probably because of the thin walls and wide doorways in relation to intervening wall sec- tions (or piers). Gallery floors were clean at the time of collapse. Its function is conjectural. Prior to its excava- tion, E. M. Shook had suggested that the compound served as a market. Excavation alone neither proved nor 380 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH disproved this possibility. But features that would en- hance permanent residence are absent. A market func- tion is not unlikely. Further East Plaza work in 1964 showed that the east side of the Central Acropolis was lined with a multiroomed gallery of the type just de- scribed. In the course of this work, Structure 5E-37 was partially excavated at the point where it joins the Cen- tral Acropolis, revealing an entry between the two plazas. Of note was evidence of Postclassic reoccupation (Pab- ellon Modeled pottery) on top of collapsed vault debris. Structure 5E-31 was probed sufficiently to show that it was not part of a ball court. Further work in 1965 is scheduled for this structure and the adjacent structures. The Central Acropolis is the final major feature to be excavated in a program, begun in 1958, of intensive study of the nucleus of Tikal, otherwise comprising the Great Plaza, North Acropolis, Temples I and II, and both East and West Plazas. The Central Acropolis exca- vations are being conducted by Peter Harrison. Cover- ing an area of about 100 by 350 m., with its long axis east-west, the Acropolis consists of five courts sur- rounded by multiroomed ranged structures or "palaces." To date, the excavations, which comprise surface clear- ing, pits, trenches, and tunnels, have centered on four courts. The objective has been to gain the fullest possi- ble knowledge of the Central Acropolis in its final stage. At the same time, deep excavation continues to dis- close important remains of prior stages of individual court development, as well as information on architec- tural trends resulting in the immense Late Classic palace complexes that make up the Acropolis. Already a series of low, multiroomed structures, going back well into, Early Classic times, has been revealed beneath Maler's "Five Story Palace." Surface structures spanning the whole of Late Classic times, and probably transitional as well, are gradually being interrelated so that an extra- ordinarily rich sequence of palace-type constructions is emerging. Two months were spent in 1964 by architects Hans-Ruedi Hug and Andrew Nagy in recording these surface structures as part of an architectural survey of Tikal. Radiocarbon dates combined with the known sequence will permit a realistic appraisal of an important segment of Tikal architectural evolution. Relevant to the problem of function of such buildings is the sequence in which they were modified. Few buildings remained untouched during use. For instance, Maler's "Palace" was extensively transformed during use. Throughout the Central Acropolis, benches were added as well as secondary walls, doorways, wall niches, and vault beams at or slightly below spring levels. Second stories and ex- terior staircases were frequently added while these build- ings were in use. While certain structures are known to have been domestically occupied during early Postclassic times, no specific proof of such usage has been found for them in earlier times. However, these buildings are essen- tially small masonry "palaces" found at distances of up to 2 km. from the Great Plaza. They may be interpreted as permanent residences. An active search continues in the Central Acropolis for features identifiable as kitchens. One approach to the problem is careful study of medial friezes and masks that decorate various Acropolis buildings. These may indicate family crests. Also important is the manner in which buildings grew up about a court, as if perhaps in response to growth of an extended family and its needs. A fourth undertaking in 1964 was investigation by Jones and Coe of a number of miscellaneous features throughout the central part of the site. Tikal ball courts were studied through excavation of Structure 5D-74 and Structures 5D-78 through 81. Structure 5D-74 was briefly probed in 1937 by the Carnegie Institution of Washing- ton. Further work in 1964 yielded a complete center-line profile and partial section, as well as plan details for the eastern portion of the court, one of the smallest in the Maya area. Noteworthy is the presence of a vertical rear wall with an inset band near its base, a battered play- ing wall with attached sloping bench, and a narrow inset stair leading to the top on both north and south sides. This playing alley-bench-apron profile was duplicated in the triple ball court comprising Structures 5D-78 through 81. Structure 5D-80 was chosen for heavy clearing and tunneling. The central court was built in early Late Classic times and was marked by a human burial axially set under each structure of the court. Access to the top was by a partially inset stairway on the north side. Later rebuilding produced three courts. The central original court went through three stages of development or re- vamping, while the later courts went through two. No apron or court markers or formally delineated endzones were found. The first sweat house at Tikal was found while exca- vating an inconspicuous small mound, Structure 5E-22. Oriented east, this Late Classic feature consisted of a single squarish room with a low doorway and a channel or alley leading north from the doorway to a rounded fire pit in the rear. Structure 6D-10, which was consid- ered to be a second sweat house, emerged as a crude platform of unknown function. Structure 5D-75, a small mound just south of Temple III, was excavated, reveal- ing a one-vaulted, Late Classic building on a one-level building platform, the whole oriented east with a single central doorway. This "shrine" was of particular interest because of early Postclassic Tepeu 3 rubbish inside and in front; this ashy trash was largely made up of censers previously identified as Postclassic. Associated monu- ment fragments possibly derive from the nearby incom- plete Stela 24 (tentatively dated as 9.19.0.0.0). With a mass of censer fragments was an unmistakable foot from a Tohil Plumbate effigy vessel. There is a growing sus- picion that early Postclassic occupation (marked by movement of monuments and robbing of tombs and caches) lasted until the advent of Tohil Plumbate, pre- sumably around A.D. 1000. This date terminates the Eznab ceramic complex, essentially of Tepeu 3 composi- tion, and initiates the Caban ceramic complex, a distinct ceramic assemblage which is weakly represented in Tikal. Two of three small, linearly arranged mounds, mapped as Structures 5C-6 through 8, were excavated and yielded 381</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY remains of square masonry platforms that may have served as piers for a bridge across the low-lying area in which they occur. Large-scale work was conducted on Structure 5C-54, an immense pyramidal mound in the southwestern part of Tikal. Prior ideas as to form were confirmed by exca- vation, which revealed that it had four barely projecting stairways leading up to a flat rectangular top which bears no trace of a building. The basic form is that of the pyramids in the twin-pyramid complexes of Tikal. However, these stairways are flanked at various terrace levels by huge masks incorporating stone blocks up to 2 m. in length. Various features indicate a construc- tion date of Early Classic, and most likely earlier. Probes revealed deep-lying Tzec (Mamom-related) deposits; sur- face sherd material on the pyramid proper was pre- dominantly Preclassic. Some tunneling was done, but the resulting sherd sample is considered unreliable. Prior evidence of heavy Preclassic construction in this part of Tikal, together with the provocative evidence from this year's work on Structure 5C-54, necessitates further excavation here in 1965. One of the most exciting results of the 1964 season was the discovery of architecture of Teotihuacan affinity (tablero-talud platforms). Partial excavation of Struc- ture 5C-53, a low, square mound west of Structure 5C-54, disclosed a low platform with stairs on each side. The platform profile consists of a vertical upper zone deco- rated with circles. This upper zone projects slightly beyond the underlying sloping zone or "talud," which is decorated with a complicated geometric design. At the bottom of the talud is a projecting basal molding. No signs of a building were found on the flat square top. Vestiges of an earlier version of the final platform were found. The latest fill sherds are early Late Classic. A comparable structure in another part of the site is de- scribed below. Fill sherds and masonry types bear out a Late Classic dating for both. Neither has stairs with lateral raised bands (balustrades or stair-side extensions), nor does the "tablero" portion have top, bottom, and corner moldings. Whether or not these unique platforms are in some way a local, modified response to Teotihua- can is a matter for conjecture. The important thing is that they do not temporally correlate with the late Early Classic monuments and tomb materials which at Tikal indicate a Teotihuacan horizon. The first task is to understand such platforms in the light of Tikal's long tradition of four-stairway platforms without surmounting buildings. With the theme of terminal Classic construction effort in mind (see East Plaza discussion), a conical mound in the southern part of the site was briefly probed. Now designated as Platform 6D-1 and lying just south of the Madeira Reservoir, it was found to be unfinished, with no stairway or surface masonry. Like Platform 5E-1 in the East Plaza, this feature consists of plastered horizontal working levels and intervening fills. The latest sherd material was of the Imix complex (related to Tepeu 2). Investigation of small structures in residential zones near the center of the site was completed in the summer of 1963. About 110 residence features were covered. What remained to be done in 1964 was study of a mound- group pattern noted in the southern part of the site. This consisted of two rather large structures, one facing east onto a plaza, the other west onto it, with a very small mound in the plaza center. This pattern was studied in 1964 by Dennis Puleston, who is also re- sponsible for investigation of Tikal chultuns. The first group was made up of Structure 6E-144 and others. Structure 6E-144 proved to be a small, four-stairway platform and belongs to the vaguely Teotihuacain mold just described for Structure 5C-53. In Structure 6E-144 there is no basal molding at the base of the talud. The final version of the platform (6E-144-lst) was in very poor condition. It overlay a largely intact 6E-144-2nd. This featured a projecting, vertical upper zone with carved circles; the lower talud was decorated with a series of elements in the form of half a Maltese cross. Fill sherds were Ik (related to Tepeu 1). The two large mounds to the east and west of this central platform were extensively excavated. Three sequent Late Classic buildings comprised the east mound, Structure 6E-146. The intermediate building (6E-146-2nd), with a vault and three west-oriented doorways, once featured an upper zone with a frieze of carved elements of probable Mexican inspiration. During the use of this structure, three single severed human heads were placed below the floor. The final building (6E-146-lst), with a floor 5 m. above the plaza, was comparable in most details to the preceding one. However, the upper masonry zone was decorated with a carved Maya inscription. Evi- dence of postclassic usage, probably domestic, was found both inside and outside this building. The construction sequence was entirely Late Classic. Structure 6E-143, on the plaza west side, was the smaller of the two but under- went a complex development. The two earlier versions were unvaulted. The final version, 6E-143-lst, had three doorways facing east and two others opening to the rear (the whole very much like the very early Classic Struc- ture 5D-26-lst on the North Acropolis). The front upper zone was highly decorated by carving, while the front stairway was centrally divided by a broad block, the front of which was carved with a jaguar. The building interior was considerably modified by wall additions dur- ing use. An Eznab complex (related to Tepeu 3), early Postclassic burial had been intruded into the front-room floor. A contemporary hearth and other evidence of late occupation were found inside this structure. The construction sequence again was entirely Late Classic, though some changes in the final building may have been Postclassic. A platform on the north, Structure 6E-145, was excavated, revealing a masonry feature that could have served a domestic function. A group of long, low-lying mounds north of Temple III was excavated by Puleston and Coe. Structures 5D-6 through 8 were excavated to gain data on possible resi- dences, partially perishable, as close to the ceremonial 382 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH center as could be found. Work showed these to be Late Classic in age and to feature multidoorwayed facades, low base walls (probably joining or protecting higher walls of poles), and thatched roofs. Conspicu- ously lacking were benches, a common secondary feature of "palaces," both large and small. Work here was in- conclusive as to actual function, but nothing was found that might preclude the possibility that these structures were used as residences. The architectural survey was extended this year far beyond central Tikal to include Morley's Group G (Struc- ture 5E-60), Group H (Structure 3D-43), the Plaza of the Seven Temples (Structure 5D-96), and Structure 5E-38. An immense body of information on construction pro- cedures and design as well as secondary additions has been gained by Hug and Nagy for a large segment of Late Classic times. This information, when coupled with that previously and concurrently gained by excavation in all parts of the site and covering a time span from Middle Preclassic to early Postclassic, creates a study problem of almost discouraging proportions. Two more years of intense recording will be needed to complete this survey of available exposed surface construction at Tikal. The methodological problems of analysis of these data are immense. If ever computer methods were applicable to archaeological problems, it is here, if only to test such a simple proposition that architecture at Tikal changed more rapidly and more significantly in terms of culture values than ceramics or any other cate- gory. An adjunct of this survey has been the recording of all available graffiti by Helen Webster. Most of this is now on paper. It should be mentioned in passing that excavation in 1965 should solve the long-standing prob- lem, namely, whether large pyramids supported build- ings of perishable materials, as shown in Temple II graffiti. The architectural survey indicates that the large, steep Structure 5D-73 directly south of Temple II was a structure of this type. Current (summer, 1964) work at Tikal consists of continued excavation in the Central Acropolis by Harri- son, architectural recording by Hug and Edward Hinder- liter, and further ceramic testing by T. Patrick Culbert, assisted by Kent Day. Culbert reports a possible inter- mediate ceramic complex between Tzec (Mamom-related) and Chuen (early Chicanel-related) in an early domestic situation beneath the platform of Structures 5F-17 and 18. The best sample of Tzec ceramics found to date was discovered here in 1963. Further data have been gained on the elusive Caban ceramic complex, one diag- nostic feature of which is Tohil Plumbate, in Structure 4F-17, originally excavated in 1959. Gradually, the se- quence of Tikal ceramic development and composition has emerged in solid fashion. Certain weak points are being filled in. The weakest in terms of definition is the Muluc complex, equivalent presumably to Tzakol at Uaxactun. Muluc ceramics may have made their appear- ance by A.D. 200, if not slightly earlier. In 1965, further work on the North Acropolis in appropriate buildings may help to strengthen this portion of the sequence. Further exploration of the Central Acropolis may also be of help. Cataloging and study of enormous collections of arti- facts and whole vessels from burials, caches, and general digging were furthered this year by Hattula Moholy-Nagy, assisted by Virginia Greene and Sally Bates. A great deal of work, apart from pressing consoli- dation and restoration, remains to be done at Tikal before the project terminates its field work at the end of 1966. Obvious topics include reservoirs, as well as deep prob- ing of potentially productive Preclassic loci in the south- western part of the site. As part of a continuing pro- gram of investigation of major temples, long conducted by Aubrey Trik, it is proposed that probable late exam- ples, such as Temples III and V, be probed in order to discover antecedent construction as well as tombs that might provide pottery to help in defining the time span of Late Classic ceramics. Mapping of outlying peripheral sites, such as Chikin Tikal, El Encanto, and Uolantun, will be continued, along with excavations designed to determine the size of the sustaining area of Tikal. The architectural survey, as noted, will require a great deal more work before full coverage is achieved. Extension of the Tikal map beyond present limits is now feasible, thanks to the cutting of survey trails by the Guatemalan government. The major task that remains is publication of the material from 11 years of intensive study at Tikal. Reports on other excavations in southeastern Meso- america have not been received in time for publication. A full presentation of current work would include that by a French group in Alta Vera Paz, by S. W. Miles at Kaminaljuyui, by E. Wyllys Andrews at Dzibilchaltun, Yucatan, and by Robert Rands at Palenque. Hopefully, what was missed in this 1964 report will be covered in that for 1965. A final note concerns authorship. I wish to underscore that I have simply reproduced, with only minor changes, reports submitted to me. There are con- flicting points of view from report to report, and no attempt has been made to reconcile them. The careful reader will be aware that at Altar de Sacrificios the Boca complex is considered to resemble Tepeu 3 and to be terminal Classic in dating, while at Tikal the Eznab complex, also affiliated with Tepeu 3, is considered as early Postclassic. Whether conflicts such as this are illusory or real is a question better explored on other pages than these. WILLIAM R. COE LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA ARGENTINA. The first session of the first national con- vention of anthropology was held in Villa Carlos Paz, Provincia de C6rdoba, May 24 to 29, 1964, organized by Jose Cruz, Nicolas Roque de la Fuente, and Victor A. Nunfez Regueiro of the Instituto de Antropologia, Uni- versidad Nacional de C6rdoba. Ninety persons attended, including personnel of institutes and universities and students of anthropology. Papers will be published, as well as resolutions and other business transacted. In- quiries should be directed to Victor Nunfez Regueiro, 383</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Comisi6n Organizadora, Instituto de Antropologia, 0. Trejo 322, C6rdoba, Argentina. The focus of the meeting was on problems of archae- ology, and a number of topics were discussed. The na- tional law (Law 9080) governing archaeological sites was reviewed, and the conclusion was reached that changes were desirable in view of altered conditions since the law was passed in 1913. Recommendations made for improvements were forwarded to executive and legisla- tive officials on provincial and national levels and to, the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas. Standard terminologies were adopted for ceramic and lithic artifacts, covering the principal terms and their definitions. A standard form for description of pottery types was also approved. Rules of priority in naming pottery types was designated as a discussion topic for the second part of the convention. Field work continued during 1963 under the sponsor- ship of a number of institutions throughout Argentina. The Museo de Historia Natural de San Rafael, Mendoza, renewed excavations at the Gruta del Puesto de las Tinajas, 20 km. southwest of the city, where four cul- tural levels were identified. Three produced very sparse cultural remains. The two lowest levels contained scrapers, beads, and chips; the two upper levels yielded remains of maize, zapallo, and bones of domesticated animals. Another shelter in the Payun region produced bones of Glossotherium with cuts and striations of human origin, but there were no associated cultural remains. The Instituto de Arqueologia y Etnologia, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, undertook eight field trips in western Argentina between March, 1963, and February, 1964. Several were devoted to recording petroglyphs, and one to excavation of a previously looted post-Columbian cemetery at Los Ranchillos, Angaco, San Juan. Eight circular pits bordered by branches were investigated; these produced numerous textile fragments but no pot- tery. Two expeditions were made to the Cerro Negro Overo (elevation 6050 meters) by B. Razquin and Erico Groch, accompanied on the first trip by Juan Schobinger. A small stone enclosure, 7 by 7 m., containing deer antlers and firewood, was identified as probably an Inca shrine associated with the Inca road that passes a few kilometers to the north and with the Tamberia de la Pampa Real at an elevation of 4000 m. on the eastern slope of the mountain. At Las Pircas, on the western side, a preceramic workshop site was found, which is believed to belong to the Ayampitin complex. The Tam- beria de la Pampa Real was surveyed during the second trip, and two additional groups of houses were discovered at elevations of 4200 and 5500 m. In February, 1964, an 1 1-day trip was made to the summit of El Toro on the Chilean border northwest of San Juan to investigate the mummified body of a young man apparently represent- ing an Inca sacrifice like the much-publicized find from Cerro El Plomo in Chile. The body was surrounded by stones and adjacent to a low 8- by 12-m. enclosure oriented toward the cardinal points. Fine textiles, cords, sandals, and a sling were among the cultural materials; additional offerings included feathers and a mouse. BETTY J. MEGGERS 384 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page></plain_text>
