It was discovered in the course of tracing the Royal Road, which at the time was thought to follow a nw direction. Instead of a roadway, Arthur Evans and his assistant Duncan Mackenzie uncovered parts of a well- preserved Neo-palatial building, which still remains the largest house yet discovered within the Bronze Age town of Knossos. The LP was fully explored in the excavation campaigns of 1905, 1908 and 1910. Apart from the invaluable services of Mackenzie, Evans had secured the assistance of Christian Doll, a skilled architect, who was in charge of the architectural plans. As revealed by the initial trial and subsequent excavation, the building was destroyed by a devastating fire, which caused the preservation of a small group of Linear B clay tablets together with numerous clay sealings. These objects were found scattered within the earth fill on the ground floor of several rooms, and the deposits were interpreted as upper floor collapse. In early publications on the LP, Evans, who based his interpretations largely on Mackenzie's notebooks, ascribed the destruction deposits to the Re-occupation Period (c. 1300-1200 bc). A slightly modified view was expressed in PM II, where the sealings were disassociated from the tablets, the latter being re-assigned without any stated reasons to the Last Palace Period (c. 1400 bc). Finally, in iWIV, Evans further revised his opinion about the date of the sealings, which he for the first time treated as being contemporary with other such deposits from Knossos. In the early 1 960s, with the outbreak of the dispute concerning the date of the destruction of the last Palace at Knossos, the LP became part of the debate. Evans's initial account gave some support for the view that tablets and sealings belonged to his 'Re-occupation' Period. John Boardman and Leonard Palmer's opposing accounts gave an insight into the complexity of the site's occupation history, especially since the excavation records were open to diverse interpretations. This was further confirmed by Mervyn Popham's studies on the LP pottery: the quantities of both LM IIIA and LM IIIB wares indicate two distinct occupation phases - or rather two events - in the building's history, but more importantly two candidates for dating the destruction by fire.1 Although research concentrated on the circumstances and timing of the LP's LM III destruction by fire, less notice has been paid to its earlier history and construction date. The lack of an independent study, with a detailed examination of the LP, became more apparent after the excavation and publication of the adjacent Minoan Unexplored Mansion (MUM), especially since the two were once part of the same complex.2 The present book aspires to bridge this gap, through a fresh examination of the excavation notebooks, the architectural remains, the surviving pottery and small finds. In addition to the Evans material, the results of the 1995 restoration programme, conducted under the auspices of the 23rd Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, have been fully integrated. They provide invaluable dating evidence for the construction and repair of various LP walls. The LP forms an integrated part of the ongoing debate regarding the destruction (or destructions?) of the Linear B Archive at the Palace. The archaeological evidence has been thoroughly used in support of a LM IIIA or a LM IIIB destruction date. In this book, the question is approached initially through the detailed and separate examination of the artifactual evidence (stratigraphy, architecture, pottery and small finds). Each category of material provides essential but often diverse information for piecing together the building's history. These conclusions are synthesised only in the final chapter where a LM IIIA2 date is proposed. Subsequently, the history of the LP is reconstructed within the urban landscapes of Neo-palatial, Final Palatial and Post-palatial Knossos. 1 OKT; Palmer 1969; Popham 19700; Popham 1970Ã. 2 MUM; Sackett 1992. 1</page><page sequence="14">2 INTRODUCTION A NOTE ON CHRONOLOGY AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE LAST PALACE AT KNOSSOS All references to dates are based on relative chronology as defined by the sequence of pottery styles. Absolute dates, established through the correlation between Egyptian and Aegean objects, are rarely given. Warren and Hankey 1989 dates have been adopted, in preference to 'higher' radiocarbon dates.3 Absolute chronology, unlike the destruction date of the last Palace at Knossos, does not directly effect the thesis of this book. The controversy over the Palace destruction was recently re-opened by the discovery of three Linear B tablets at Chania from a fire destruction deposit, dated, following the local pottery sequence, to LM IIIB1.4 In 1993 J. -P. Olivier identified Scribe 115, known from the main Archives at Knossos, as being responsible for two of the three Chania tablets.5 In 1994 Tom Palaima challenged this identification.6 Subsequently the identification of Scribe 1 1 5 at Chania has been abandoned. However, Jan Driessen's re-assessment of the tablet groups from the S.W. Area of the Palace, dated to LM II or LM IIIAi, has challenged the unity of the Knossos Archives.7 The highly selective and often problematic Palace pottery groups offer their own clues to the date of destructions, re-occupation and abandonment: Popham's traditional date for a destruction in early LM IIIA2 is based on the quantities of contemporary pottery deriving from the Palace and surrounding houses.8 By raising the date of the Domestic Quarter's ceramic deposits to LM IIIA2, originally assigned by Popham to the LM IIIB Re-occupation, Peter Warren 'lowered' the destruction date of the Palace to LM IIIA2.9 Warren makes a strong case especially by adding the stone vases from the Throne Room and the Sculptor's Workshop to Popham's LM III A 1/2 destruction deposits.10 Although in this book an LM IIIA2 date for the destruction of the Palace is adopted, this is not used as evidence in favour of arguing that the LP destruction was contemporary. 3 Warren 1987; Warren 1991c; Warren 1996^; Warren and Hankey 1989; but also Betancourt 1988; Manning 1996.

Usually the text is on the verso, with the recto reserved for sketch-plans, chiefly made to a 1:100 scale (e.g. plan 13). There is a total of nineteen sketch-plans in all three DM/ DB.2 From a comparison with other notebooks, it seems likely that these sketches were made on site, but that the text was added later on, probably at the end of a day's work.3 From the dates given, it appears that Mackenzie's intention was to keep a record of the excavation on a regular basis. When excavation started, entries were made every day, but as work progressed this was gradually altered and one entry made to cover more than one day's digging, at times even a whole week's work. This practice was frequent by the end of the 1905 season, and regular in 1908, but in 1910, the whole period of the excavation was covered by only a few entries. DM/DB deals primarily with architectural features, such as walls, doors and floors. These were occasionally described in some detail, with references to their nature and state of preservation. Wall heights are rarely given.4 Soil descriptions although precise in distinguishing 'Minoan levels' from those identified as 'Hellenic and Roman', are limited to only certain parts of the building. Find places of objects are recorded with a mark x, or a small drawing on the 1:100 sketch-plans and/or with a brief comment in the text (e.g. plan 12). However, not every object found was reported; some were recorded only by Evans. The accounts of the different rooms roughly follow the sequence in which these were uncovered; some however were not reported at all. In such cases, it is assumed that nothing interesting, in terms of architecture, deposit, or objects, was found; that Mackenzie was not on site during their excavation; or that he simply forgot to report them. Mackenzie was responsible for the regular excavation diary, but Evans kept his own notebooks on issues that particularly interested him, such as sealings, tablets, frescoes and other small finds.5 On various occasions these supplement the DM/DB. This habit could well imply a division of responsibilities between Evans and his assistant, rather than that Mackenzie failed to report on the discovery of various small objects. The notebooks of Evans for 1905 and 1908 are unbound white paper notepads, measuring 10.5 by 5 cm, written in pencil or ink. In these, texts are kept to a minimum with more space given to either sketch-plans, which may include the find spots of objects, or accurate drawings of any small finds which attracted Evans's attention (plans 15-16). Especially valuable are his lists of sealings, since they still remain our only source of information for most of them.6 Finally in a cloth-bound notebook for 1922-1926 a page labelled 'Little Palace' lists mason's marks carved in various rooms. Christian Doll made the architectural plans in 1910, after the excavation had come to an end, and much of his work was subsequently published in Evans 1914 or PM. The original pencil version of the 1910 inked ground plan is reproduced in plan 17.7 The ground plan is at 1:100 and, although not a stone by stone one, it records absolute heights of walls, floors, doorjambs and other architectural features. It was drawn after Room 1 7 had been roofed over, since here Doll makes reference to an 1 The notebooks are titled: Day-book of the Excavations at Knossos, 1905 Duncan Mackenzie; Day-book of the Excavations at Knossos, 1908 Duncan Mackenzie; Excavations at Knossos, 1910 Duncan Mackenzie; henceforth referred to as DM/DB. For a further discussion on Mackenzie's and Evans's notebooks see Momigliano 1999, 42-5. 2 Eleven are published here, plans a-'a. 3 A separate DM/DB was kept in 1908 for the excavation of the Isopata tombs. Here the date and number of every tomb was obviously recorded in advance, since in several examples these were never supplemented by text. 4 The single reference to a wall height was for Room 1 9, DM/ ZXO27.iv.05, 57. 5 These have become known as AE/NB.

All levels were taken from a higher point set along the exposed facade of the MUM. Unfortunately, this datum was adopted after the excavation had come to an end, so no cross-references to absolute levels are possible for the small finds discovered during the three years of the excavation. In the Evans Archive there are 26 photographs of the LP.8 Although some might date to the 1905 season, most were taken during the 1908 and 1910 campaigns. After excavation was completed, the building was photographed at least twice, once in 1922 and later in 1931, after various sections were either repaired or reconstructed in modern masonry. A second set of photographs, added to the collection, was taken by Noel Heaton during his visit to Knossos in 1910. The photographs and Doll's pencil plan (plan 17) have been of great value, since the building's appearance has much changed through weathering, gradual decay or later restoration work. Evans's Publications In the 1 905 BSA preliminary report, the course of the excavation was outlined and the most important rooms were described in some detail.9 In these Evans relied heavily on DM/DB, with Mackenzie's observations often copied verbatim, especially concerning evidence for dating.10 In general the two excavators seem to have been in agreement; at least there are no major differences between Evans 19°4~5 and DM/DB. However, Evans was more decisive than his assistant in drawing historical conclusions on the nature and date of the finds discovered. For 1908 and 1910, references to the progress of the Knossos excavations were made in JHS and The Times.11 These reports are of a brief nature and add no additional information to what is recorded in AE/NB and DM/DB. The lack of detailed reports for these last two years was made good by the publication of a long article devoted to the Tomb of the Double Axes and the LP in 1914.12 Although those parts of the building excavated in 1908 and 1910 were published here for the first time, the style of the article is not one of a preliminary report. Evans no longer copied his assistant's writings and seems to have been less influenced by his remarks on matters of stratigraphy and dating. The text was accompanied by a large number of photographs, either of small finds or of well-preserved parts of the building, together with Doll's 1910 architectural plans (plans 18, 22-25). Except for Evans's revised views on the date of the sealings and tablets, the PM volumes add little information on the building. Several sealings were published here for the first time and the brief report on the 1931 restoration was included, but in general information recorded in previous publications or unpublished notebooks is duplicated. Inaccuracies often creep in especially in the different volumes of the PM, which were written long after the excavation had come to an end. METHOD OF EXCAVATION In 1904, the discovery of the Théâtral Area and the monumental Royal Road had initiated much interest in the town of Knossos, which spread around the slopes of the Palace mound. It was during the excavation of the Royal Road that Evans and Mackenzie had to face for the first time deep Greek and Roman deposits lying over the Minoan levels - a situation, which except for the Palace site itself, occurs regularly throughout Knossos.13 This 'problem' was solved by the application of a new and different excavation system, the purpose of which was to remove in the fastest possible way, without detailed recording, those deposits identified as post-Minoan. A clear description of how the new 'wager system' worked was given in the 1904 DM/DB, where deep post-Minoan deposits were much delaying the exposure of the Royal Road: These special circumstances led us to consider the advisability of excavation here according to a method which while workable under such circumstances had not been possible hitherto within the Palace itself, where the deposit - beginning at the surface - the conditions were of an entirely opposite character. The method proposed was work by wager as follows: the area proposed to be 8 Eight are reproduced for the first time (plates 2 a-b, 3 0, 5 a-b, 6 b, 10 a-b). 9 Evans 1904-5, 2-16. 10 Compare Mackenzie's description on the excavation of the 24 x 2.5 m test pit with Evans's account in his preliminary report: DM/DB 22.iv.05, 48-9 and Evans 1904-5, 3. 11 Dawkins 1908, 325; Dawkins 1909, 360-1; Dawkins 1910, 362; The Times, 27 August 1908, 6; 29 June 1909, 5; 16 September 1910, 4; 2 7 July 1931, 9. 12 Evans 1914. 13 A summary of the evidence in favour of post-Minoan remains on the Kephala Hill is given in Driessen 1990, 44-5. Apart from the Royal Road, dense post-Minoan occupation levels have been traced s of the West Court: Coldstream and Macdonald 1997.</page><page sequence="17">THE EXCAVATION 5 excavated is divided out into lots of 2 or 3 square metres each an equal number of men is assigned to each lot, the smallest combination being of three men, and these all starting at a certain moment a wager is laid as to who shall first reach a certain depth of 2 or 4 or 6 metres, the depth decided upon being always half a metre from the surface of the deposit under consideration.14 When the nw orientation of the Royal Road was discovered 'the new rapid method of work by wager was at once put into operation ... a series of equal lots was divided out and work started on them at the same moment a series of prizes ist, 2nd, 3rd being offered to those who should first get down to the level of the roadway.'15 For the LP, which was only the second building after the Arsenal to be excavated in such a way, there is no record of the number or dimensions of the wager trenches. However, at the beginning of the 1 908 season Mackenzie commented that the orientation of the 1 905 trenches had to be changed from sw to ne so as to align with the course of the LP rather than that of the Royal Road.16 A sketch from the 1923 excavation of the House of the Frescoes illustrates how the area intended for excavation by the wager system was divided up into equal 4 by 4 metre squares, which were numbered from 1 to 5.17 In PM&gt; excavation by wager was described as 'quarrying work' and was illustrated by a 1908 photograph depicting excavation in progress along the space between the LP and the MUM where 'the workmen are seen competing in four pits, watched by our then overseer old Gregori' (plate 8 ¿).18 In plate 9 a Mackenzie can be seen supervising the excavation by wagers in the E half of the Basement. The effectiveness of the wager system was based on Mackenzie's ability to distinguish a Minoan from a post-Minoan level according to a difference in soil colour. By the time excavation began on the LP site, Mackenzie had a clear idea on the characteristics and appearance of Minoan deposits, indoor or outdoor, and how different these were from those he identified as 'later Greek and Roman'. Thus the post-Minoan deposits in the initial test pit in particular were described as 'pale grey Hellenic and Roman earth'19 but others were recorded as 'poor earthy grey black' or of a 'pale clayey colour'.20 The soil of the Minoan levels was usually described as 'terracotta coloured earth',21 'rich tawny-red earth',22 or 'ruddy tawny golden',23 the texture of which was sometimes commented upon as of a 'loose crumbling character'.24 Mackenzie regularly reported on the reason why the Minoan levels had acquired such a characteristic red colour: 'The many rubble walls faced with stucco and the partitions partly at least built up out of sun-dried bricks when subjected to the action of fire naturally take on this rich tawny golden tint which is the characteristic one for Minoan deposit throughout the site of Knossos.'25 Although the 'wager system' solved the problem of rapidly removing levels identified as post- Minoan, Mackenzie failed to recognise several dangers that the method could embrace. At Knossos, Bronze Age levels are not universally red in colour and fire destruction debris is just one of the types of soil which may occur on any given site. Thus during the excavation of the LP or other buildings explored after 1905, Bronze Age levels, of which the soil colour was different than what was expected, may have been accidentally removed without record.26 In DM/DB no direct reference was made on how excavation progressed through the Minoan levels, but these were probably dug in layers, after the walls of the rooms in question were defined. However, more unorthodox methods were also applied, such as in Room 19 (Room of the Fetish), where digging proceeded in section. Mackenzie made no reference to the use of a sieve during the excavation of the Minoan levels; however, it must have been in use as soon as the first tablet and sealing deposits started to appear.27 14 DM/DB 2.V.04, 56.

AE/NB 10.iv.00.</page><page sequence="18">6 THE EXCAVATION THE 1905 EXCAVATION SEASON Introduction The LP was the major find of the 1905 excavation season, part of which was excavated between March 1 and May 27. Initially, the building was called 'the West House', due to its orientation in relation to the Palace, or 'the House of the Fetishes', after some of its most intriguing finds. At the beginning of the season, the only definite plans for excavation were the complete exploration of the Arsenal and the continuation along the Royal Road. Then the olive grove on the slopes of the hill rising w of the Palace was for the first time considered as a promising spot for future exploration, especially since it was apparently in line with the Royal Road to the ne.28 Evidence for the extent of the Minoan town towards this direction had been provided when widespread Minoan levels had become exposed in the cutting for the modern road to Herakleion. These were the primary reasons why the excavators' attention turned to this site. After the discovery of two post-Minoan wells in the vicinity of the LP site, a small part of the building became exposed when a test 24 x 2.5 metres long, running nne-ssw, was sunk in the olive grove in search of section of the Royal Road that was expected in this direction (plan 4).29 Mackenzie and Evans's luck is enviable: soon after the Minoan levels had been reached, along the s half of the trench, Linear B tablet fragments were discovered. During the following day, the nw corner of the Peristyle in Room 7 became exposed, initiating a full-scale excavation of the newly discovered building. Excavation by wager for the removal of deposits identified as 'post-Minoan' must have been applied simultaneously in an extensive area in the olive grove. The excavation of the Minoan deposits are recorded in DM/DB in a room-by-room sequence, which must roughly reflect the order in which they were uncovered. After revealing the Peristyle, excavation continued immediately to the w and n. The two doorways leading to Room 1 9 (Room of the Fetish) were defined and excavation proceeded in section within this room. Work was resumed along the s part of Room 7 (Peristyle Hall), to be followed by the complete excavation of Rooms 8-10 (Minoan Megaron). Room 18 (N-S Corridor), Room 17 (Lustral Basin/Fetish Shrine) and Room 1 2 (Anteroom to the Shrine) were the next to be described. Work stopped with the discovery of the s end of the West Facade, after Rooms 19-25 became at least partially exposed.30 However, certain areas around Staircase 32 (Main Staircase) seem to have been explored only to a certain degree during this year. For example the Early Facade was also uncovered in 1905, including some areas to the w of Staircase 32 (plan 9). The columned balustrade between Rooms 24/25 was recognised only in 1908, even though the outline of the room had been already defined from the previous excavation season (plans 9, 13). By the end of the 1905 season Evans reported that an area 31m N-s x 21 m E-w of the building had been excavated.31 Room 7: the 24 x 2.5 m Test-trench and the Peristyle Hall32 Seven entries are devoted to this room, since it was the first to be fully investigated but also because much of the ground plan was missing and had to be reconstructed on paper (plans 4-7; plates 1-2). The 24 x 2.5 m test pit which initiated the exploration of the LP exposed part of the nw end of Room 7 (plan 4) : As the excavation of the trench progressed the abundance of this tawny earth throughout the south half of the section excluded the possibility of a roadway at any part of the section but at the same time made the probability of some important construction on the spot all the more apparent. In the course of the day the probability became fact some rubble wall construction could be distinguished and out of this at the point xxx the fragment (end) of an inscribed tablet was excavated. As the wall was in a crumbling condition it was not clear whether the tablet-fragment came out of the wall or had fallen down into the wall material from an upper storey. This was the second time that the existence of inscribed tablets had been verified outside the area of the palace the other instance being the tablets found last year in the basement magazines of an important building bounding the Royal Roadway on the N. In this case also the tablets had fallen from an upper storey into the 28 Evans 1903-4, 49-51. 29 The orientation of the test pit was determined by the assumed orientation of the Royal Road, whereas the exact spot was chosen so as to avoid the removal of any trees in the olive grove: Evans 1904-5, 3.

The new tablet-fragment pointed to an important house site and late in the day all conjecture was converted into fact on the discovery of the column bases 1, 2, 3 in the south part of the trench in sketch 1 ." During the following working day Mackenzie reported that: . . . the column bases were of a hard limestone which shows a tendency to scale away under the action of fire. These rested on a stylobate of the natural soft limestone familiar in the palace. In the angle formed by the three column bases was found polygonal paving of hard slaty ironstone which as in the palace (for example the W court) indicated areas open to the sky. The angle described by the column bases thus indicated an open rectangular court open to the sky rather than a covered portico where on the analogy of the palace gypsum paving would have been more in place +. The court indicated by the angled system of column-bases while open to the sky was on the other hand probably an interior one with interior house facade to the E as well as to SW and N. To the N &amp; W it would probably turn out that there were covered loggias with gypsum paving.34 By April 5 the wager system was in full swing, running simultaneously with the slower excavation of the Minoan levels throughout the area of the test pit: It was now clear that the excavation of the whole area covered by the building would be required and accordingly the removal of the post-Minoan deposit on the wager system was commenced at once. Equal surfaces were measured out and excavated layer wise in order to obviate the removal of any of the underlying Minoan deposit. Simultaneously with the work of further excavation of the Minoan deposit gradually uncovered was produced with. With the exception of a fragment or two no further inscribed tablets occurred but on the other hand broken clay seals turned up in considerable numbers especially in the area in which the fragment of an inscribed tablet was first discovered.35 After the complete excavation of the 'colonnaded system', work continued along the nw part and revealed the well-preserved gypsum paving and the two doorways opening into Room 1 9 (Room of the Fetish), of which 'the one to the north was afterwards closed by means of a wall of rubble masonry and plaster' (plans 5-6; plate 5 a).36 At the time when the northern borders of Room 7 were excavated it became clear that 'the 3W-most doorways in this system had been afterwards walled up and this was possibly also true of the 4th or east-most door, through this once again may have been had left open in order to keep up communication with the columnar court'.37 The excavation of the paved section immediately south of the Peristyle was reported much later, although it was probably excavated at the same time. Room 6b: the Entrance Hall38 The sparse remains of this room seem to have been dug simultaneously with the s half of Room 7 (Peristyle Hall) after the N and E limits of the building had been reached but before excavation proceeded further w into the building (plan 8; plates 1-2). Much of the room had been robbed out and only the two doorways numbered 14 and 15 in plan 8 remained in situ. On May 1 . Mackenzie reported the following: The S limit of this colonnade system is conditioned by the position of the doorways 14 &amp; 15 provided the system of these doorways is continued in a flight E-wards as far as 13. The double reveals of doorjamb 1 8 show that the doorways continued E-wards beyond this doorjamb. These doorways had each of them a flight of steps up N somewhat in the manner of the doorsteps of the Antechamber to the Throne Room in the Palace. The interval between these door-ways and the a')Xr' would thus have formed a sort of vestibule or entrance hall 4.15 wide from N to S. In this connection it would be convenient to consider the area 20 as outside the actual house but this cannot have been true of the W part of the area. The doorjamb 19 requires a second to keep it company and the doorway thus given would have lead into a corridor going NS to W of it. That there probably was a corridor is made all the more likely by the existence of the doorway opening W (of such a corridor) at 22. This corridor though somewhat narrower would thus be the prolongation of the corridor running NS to the W of the auXr].39 33 DM/DB 2 2. iv.o 5, 48-Q.

Despite the lengthy references to various architectural features, Mackenzie's account lacks any information on the nature of the deposits (plans 6-7; plates 1-2).41 On April 28 Mackenzie gave the first full report on Room 8 (plan 6): The corridor N of the colonnaded court opens N-wards by 4 doorways into a room 5M NS by 6.75 EW and having flights of doorways on all sides except the W. The doorways (4N 4S &amp; 3E) are 1 1 in number and present an arrangement exactly resembling that of the Hall of the Eleven DoorWays in the domestic quarter of the palace. The 3W-most of the doors on the S side like the whole N series were blocked up in the period of reoccupation. The doorjambs 1, 2, 3, 4, were found in situ. The doorjamb 5 was missing while 6 was found built into a later construction. That there was an angle in the system of doorways where the doorjambs 6 &amp; 7 are put was proved by the fact that the foundation blocks of limestone for these doorjambs were found in a corresponding angular position in relation to each other the doorjambs 7 &amp; 8 were out of position but they were found quite near where they now appear. Doorjamb 9 is missing. The flight 10-14 were in position but the doorways themselves were blocked up in the period of re-occupation. The room was paved with quartered slabs of gypsum forming a border 1 .40 wide and centred by a panel of polygonal ironstone slabs. This system of paving is familiar at the palace in the Throne-room and Antechamber as also in the Room of the Column-bases. This central panel was probably covered with fine red stucco and traces of such stucco are visible in the case of the pannel of the Throne room floor. In the NW corner of this room the reoccupiers had arranged an erection like a fire-place with a recess below like that for ashes and at any rate this construction with the fact of the walling up of so many doorways indicates that in the later times the room had been degraded to more common uses than the original ones.42 On May 29, as excavation progressed into Rooms 9 and 10 Mackenzie recorded the following: It has been said that the system of doorjambs 10-14 on opp. sketch had been blocked up in the period of re-occupation but until this blocking up was recognised the system was taken for a wall the visible S ends of the doorjamb appearing like the stone bases for upright wall posts such as those that occur elsewhere at Knossos as for example in the portico to the lower EW corridor. It was, however, noticeable that the supposed bases were of gypsum and on further excavation on the N side of the supposed wall the gypsum bases were seen to project considerably beyond the N face of the wall which itself was so thin has [sic] to be hardly more than a rubble and plaster partition. A little further testing brought out the fact that the supposed bases were doorjambs and that what was originally a system of doorways as opposite 1) 10-14 had been blocked up by the partition wall we had discovered. In this rearrangement the original door posts of wood and plaster work were made to enter into the construction of the partition having between them on the N. side a series of cup- board like recesses as shown on last sketch. In this way the remains of the carbonised wood of the door-posts came to be much better preserved than they would have been without the protection and support afforded by the partition. In the whole of the area to the N. of this system of doorways and the partition wall were found quantities of different varieties of peas and plentiful samples of this were collected. From the position of the peas in the deposit it was clear that most if not all of it had fallen through from a store-room above with the collapse of the floor of this as the result of some conflagration. The whole of the peas or vetch was highly carbonised though at the same time quite well preserved for two varieties to be distinguishable. The system of doorways 10-14 has north of it a chamber communicating by means of the doorways with the chamber of the 1 1 doorways already referred to. The doorways 10-14 are communal to both rooms and communicate between them. The new chamber has 3 further door-ways opening E. By reference to the sketch for Friday 28th April it will be seen that this chamber is apparently bounded on the N by a solid wall but this wall cuts across the N. part of the floor-panelling in a way to suggest that it cannot have been an original part of the room construction and when it is seen that the wall ends E-wards in the middle of a doorway it becomes at once certain that the construction like the partition which marked the doorways to the S is an addition of later date. N. of this wall however, came out a gypsum block on a stylobate of limestone (see sketch) in position and comparing the position of this with that of the N edge of the panelling it was evident that the gypsum block and the remains of the stylobate 40 Nomenclature: 'Megaron' in AE/NB and Evans 1904-5, 5; The Great Megaron' in plan 18. 41 As excavation progressed through different rooms Mackenzie numbered various architectural features, such as doorjambs and column bases, in order to assist their identification. These numbers have been maintained here; thus Mackenzie's sketch-plans, reproduced in plans 6-7, should be consulted. 42 DM/DB 28.iv.05, 58-9.</page><page sequence="21">THE EXCAVATION 9 represented the original N. wall of the room. The wall judging from its material of gypsum on a stylobate formed also apparently the N boundary and facade of the house. Doorjamb 18 was not found but the double reveals of doorjamb 17 require the additional doorway north of it and there is just room for this door-way between doorjambs 17 and the facade. The arrangement to the E of this room and the one to the S of it with the 1 1 doors is of great interest. Adjacent E to doorjambs 16-18 was found iron-stone paving in position and this was found to run N. S. Between doorjambs 15 and 17 this paving was found to be bordered by a line of quadrate limestone slabs running NS. In the middle of this line of slabs was found a column base in position. At an interval of 2.20 N of this &amp; almost opposite doorjamb 17 was found part of the curve in the limestone stylobate with which must have fitted a limestone column base similar to the one in position. The column base itself however, had disappeared. The arrangement thus appears as an open corridor or verandah 1.64 wide, would bound eastwards by a flight of columns and running NS. S. of this no further column-bases were found but that the corridor bases continued S wards for some considerable distance was proved by the fact that some further ironstone paving was found in situ at a distance of M 9.50 from the N. end of the corridor. Adjacent E to this series of iron-stone slabs careful search brought out the fragment of a slab of the limestone stylobate in situ and with part of the W edge of the slab preserved. Thus the stylobate was continuous with the paving and the continuation of the stylobate involves the continuation of the colonnade. The original arrangement would thus have been as seen in the last sketch. Unfortunately later builders working in this direction had removed almost the whole of the system with the exception of what has been described.43 A further set of doorways was also found blocked up, namely the three N doorways, along the e wall of Room 9. Our only reference to this alteration is Mackenzie's sketch for April 29 (plan 6). Considerable information on the different architectural features found scattered within the fill of Rooms 8 and 9 were recorded in AE/NB for 1905 (plan 15). All objects were found between 2.00- 1.50 metres above the paved floors of Room 7: 'Seals + insc' were found along the sw end of Room 8. Further to the n and along the w wall of Room 8 was a 'Deposit of Egypt, beans in wooden chest - from about 1-50 m. above floor'. 'Inscript' were reported near the ne end; plus a 'Deposit of [?] sunk to near floor' along the nw corner. 'Part of burnt column' was found further to the w. Finally 'upper floor doorjamb &amp; pavement sloping forward for about 1.20 M. above floor' were discovered in the vicinity of the w wall of Room 9. Room 19: the Room of the Fetish44 Room 19, or as Mackenzie named it, 'the Room of the Fetish', was fully investigated, after the nw part of Room 7 had been defined (plan 5; plate 5 a),45 During the early days of the excavation, the space between the Peristyle and the two doorways leading to Room 19 had been identified as a corridor: The N. part of this corridor had two doorways opening to the W. and of these two doorways the one to the N. was after-wards closed by means of a wall of rubble masonry and plaster. The S door of the two on excavation was found to give access W- wards to a small square room without window apparently and having a narrower doorway at the E. end of its N. wall opening into a narrow corridor running N. This narrow doorway was afterwards blocked by a wall of rubble &amp; plaster. This room was 2.45 EW by 2.60 NS and its 3 walls S, W &amp; N were preserved to a height of 2.60 from the floor of the room. In this room at about 1 metre above the floor was found a stone approximating to an infantile human form and possibly used as a fetish.46 However, a more detailed description of the room was given after Rooms 8-10 (Minoan Megaron) had been fully exposed and recorded: The first of the rooms flanking the corridor [Room 7] to W-wards to be brought out was that led into through door- ways 1 &amp; 2. The deposit in the door-ways and in the room had the same red terracotta colour and loose crumbling character as that which was found in the corridor itself. This rich tawny-red earth was characteristic of the Minoan stratum in all parts of the area and its occurrence in the course of the preliminary removal of surface deposit was always the signal for the workmen that they had reached the limit down-ward of the surface deposit which itself in complete contrast was of a poor earthy grey black colour. The tawny colour was produced by the action of fire on the earthy constituents of rubble walls and on the plaster and brick materials of room partitions. These 43 DM/DB 2q.iv.05, 60-1. 44 Nomenclature: In AE/NB 1905, 1 1 Room 19 was also referred to as 'R. of Large Fetish'; in Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933- 5, as the 'Room s. of Corridor e. of Shrine', see P.

It was the gradual dissolution of such materials after the conflagration, which had destroyed the house that itself, accounts for the tawny hue of the Minoan deposit as a whole. In the room in question and in this loose tawny deposit appeared in section as the workmen proceeded inwards from the doorway the first considerable deposit of clay seals found here. Their confused distribution in this deposit at a considerable altitude above the floor made it evident that the clay seals did not originally belong to this room but that they had fallen into this room with the floor of a corresponding room above. Almost simultaneously clay seals of a similar character began to emerge under similar conditions in the adjacent rooms as indicated on the sketch so that provisionally it may be held for probable that most if not all of the clay seals found originally belonged to rooms situated above the lower storey of the building. That there was such an upper storey is made abundantly clear through the existence of the staircase up S. and then up N. in the s. part of the system. Each flight of this stair had 12 steps including the landing-step in either case and the construction &amp; proportions were analogous to those familiar from the palace. A curious discovery made in the room above referred to [Room 19] was that of a limestone figure of natural formation resembling an infant wrapped up in swaddling clothes and which according to Mr. Evans has to be regarded as a fetish. The fact that the stone considerably burned was found* not on the floor but in the tawny deposit at some height above this makes it probable that the stone figure did not originally belong to the room in which it was found but had either fallen or been hastly removed here.47 Finally, when Room 17 (Lustral Basin/Fetish Shrine) was fully investigated Mackenzie added the following note: '* The discovery of the small shrine adjacent to the N wall with similar images of smaller size makes it probable that the image in question belonged also to the shrine.'48 Corridor 18: the North-South Corridor49 Corridor 18 (plan 10) was uncovered after Room 19 (Room of the Fetish) and Rooms 8-10 (Minoan Megaron) had been completely exposed, but before excavation commenced in Room 17 (Lustral Basin/Fetish Shrine): The room referred to [Room 19] was found to have at the E end of its N wall a doorway .75 wide (.65 between the reveals) and this doorway like so many others in the building was found blocked up by means of a plaster partition. N of this doorway occurred a narrow passage running SN and in turn blocked up at its N end by means this time of a rubble wall. This could only mean that in the period re-occupation beginning with the walling up of doorways the corridor came to be disused entirely. In the tawny deposit of the corridor were found clay seals similar in general character to those found in the 'Room of the Fetish' and elsewhere. The blocking up of the corridor at both ends made it apparent that this had originally belonged to a system much more important than that indicated by the transformation to common uses so characteristic of the period of re-occupation. The uniform earth surface of the W wall of the corridor so closely resembling that of the door-partition at the S end of the corridor made us suspect the genuine original character of the W wall and our suspicions were confirmed by the results brought out in the area adjacent to the wall to W of it.50 However, it was only after excavation had progressed into Room 1 7 that 'Our suspicions of the wall turned out to be justified on our finding that the supposed wall was really a thin partition like that blocking up the S door of the corridor and like that of later construction belonging to the re-occupation period.'51 Furthermore, remains of 'polygonal paving' were traced along the corridor's north end. Long after the end of the building's excavation, Evans reported a second modification, this time along the e wall of the corridor: While the original constructions here go back to the earlier period of the Little Palace, there is evidence of more than one subsequent modification. It is clear, for instance, that according to the original arrangement there were three openings between the small corridor that runs east of the sunken area and the great Megaron ... at some still flourishing period in the history of the building, however, these openings were blocked with good masonry'.52 47 DM/DB 2.V.05, 64-5. 48 DM/DB 2.V.05, 65. w Nomenclature: Corridor by bhnne in UM/DB; in rendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933-5, as tne 'Corridor E of Shrine', see P.

The order in which various architectural features, deposits and small finds are recorded in DM/DB must reflect the order in which the excavation progressed. The deposits along the s half of the room and down to the level of the gypsum balustrade were first to be mentioned, followed by the excavation of the 'sunken area', that is, below the level of the gypsum balustrades. Finally the N limits of the room were described, namely the N balustrade, the doorway opening to the room and its descending gypsum steps. As excavation progressed: The deposit here was of the usual tawny colour and the usual clay seals came out in small quantities but a find of much greater interest than these was the discovery in situ on a decayed gypsum ledge against the S wall of the remains of a pair of 'horns of consecration' which at once gave to the enclosure the character of a house sanctuary. The horns had got partly broken through the falling down of debris from above but the circumstances made it quite clear that they were in situ. The sacred character of the place was further confirmed by the find of a small terracotta image of a horned and bearded goat just in front &amp; below the level of the ledge from which it must have fallen with the fall from above of the debris already referred to. Still more surprising was the find in the immediate neighbourhood of the horns of small natural figures of stone like that of much larger size found in the next room to the S. The discovery of these figures in the immediate environment of the 'horns of consecration' whose religious character is itself so clear makes it still more probable that they also had a religious function. One of these figures was curious from its resemblance on a smaller more infantile scale to the figure found in the adjacent room.54 At this point, what had originally being identified as a wall dividing Rooms 17 and 19, proved to be a balustrade with three columns: At the same time as these discoveries were being made considerable progress had also been made in bringing out the features of the room as a whole. Especially the W face of the suspicious looking W. wall of the adjacent corridor was brought more fully into view with many surprising results. Our suspicions of the wall turned out to be justified on our finding that the supposed wall was really a thin partition like that blocking up the S door of the corridor and like that of later construction belonging to the re-occupation period. A detailed description of this partition wall was given in the 1 905 BSA Report: During the period of re-occupation, the openings between three of the wooden columns which had originally stood on the round stone bases of the balustrade on the side facing the small corridor had been blocked and half of their diameter had been embedded in a clay and rubble walling, which must effectually have shut out the light from the passage-way. So it came about that, when later the wooden shafts themselves were destroyed by fire, they left in the plaster of the wall behind them almost perfect casts of their embedded halves.55 Regarding the state of preservation of the upper courses of this partition wall, Mackenzie reported that 'there was unfortunately no impression of the moulding of the capitals as these must have stood higher than the actual level of the surface of the Minoan deposit. There is no doubt however that the capitals were also included in the construction of the added partition since this must have gone up to ceiling.'56 But although no information was given in DM/DB on the condition of the wooden columns Evans noted that 'the wooden shafts themselves were destroyed by fire' and 'charred remains were found' along the north and east balustrades.57 Furthermore, when these were 'carefully swept, the colour of the column base in relief on it, like those of the E and S balustrade was brought out'. Mackenzie's narration continues as follows: Meanwhile though the remains of gypsum ledging on which were found the 'Horns of Consecration' seemed sufficiently explained to us on the analogy of the ledge for horns of consecration in the Shrine on the SE quarter of the palace the continuation of this ledging along the E wall of the room where there was no trace of any paving towards the centre of the enclosure could not be similarly explained. On this ledging having been more thoroughly freed from its superimposed deposit the appearance of the raised discs for these column-bases in its surface brought the true explanation of ™ Nomenclature: 'Shrine', in P.

This balustrade with columns in the period of re-occupation had been blocked up at a time when the columns themselves were standing. Of this a curious proof was forthcoming. The W. face of the partition wall was found to have impressed into it the moulded vertical groove widening above into which the columns themselves had been made to put on or becoming part of the [illegible]. An impression of about a third of the whole circumference of the columns was thus obtained at the bases this proportion becoming greater with the widening of the circumference above. The impression still has upon it the clear traces of the moulding of the columns, which was not that of a simple cylinder but such as to resemble the inverse of the fluting of a Greek Doric column. There was unfortunately no impression of the moulding of the capitals, as these must have stood higher than the actual level of the surface of the Minoan deposit. There is no doubt however that the capitals were also included in the construction of the added partition since this must have gone right up to the architrave.58 In the following day's notebook entry Mackenzie continued: At a stage in the excavation when it was natural to take the remains of the balustrade as part of the rooms paving though it was at a higher level than the room pavings adjacent E we were puzzled by the non appearance of the usual panel (of polygonal iron stone slabs) in the centre of the room. At first indeed we were afraid that the remains of this paving may have been inadvertently removed by the workmen. On our identification now of the balustrade we no longer expected the central panel. We had now on the analogy of the Throne Room 'Light well' to look for the real of paving of the system at a lower level. This work was now proceeded with. It was at once apparent that the deposit below the level of the surface of the balustrade was of the same character as that above this level. It was in general of the same late re-occupation character as elsewhere in the building. Everything that came out in the course of removing the deposit went to confirm the general impression of a complete re-occupation of the house in the later period. The deposit was of the same tawny golden colour as elsewhere only that the remains of burnt wood seemed more plentiful as usually happens when the floor level is approached. On the presumptive floor level having been reached we were surprised to find that there was no gypsum paving as we had expected, not even decayed remains of such could anywhere be traced. There is however one feasible explanation of this. The balustrade had already suggested a 'light well' arrangement like that of the 'Throne-room' and the possibility provisionally need not be excluded that the floor in the case may have been of cement like that of the 'Light Wells' (in those cases, however, quite open to the sky) of the 'Royal Staircase' and 'Hall of the Double-axes' in the palace.59 The N end of the room was the last to be exposed and recorded on May 5: On the N. wall of the system having been clearly brought into view it was noticed that in front of it were the remains of gypsum balustrading like that in front of the partition wall on the E side. It was, however, remarkable that this new balustrading was not close to the wall as in the case of that against the S wall opposite but that it went along with an interval between it and the wall and also an interval between it and the E balustrade. Simultaneously also a door- way was brought out in the W. end of the N. wall. It was now natural to put the part of this doorway into connection with that of the interval between the adjacent balustrade and the wall and to regard the door- way as the entrance and the interval as an inside passage into the system. The threshold of the doorway .64- .74 wide was at the same level as those of the east of the building. The question now was whether the floor of the system should turn out to be at the same level or be deeper. The analogy of the Throne room light well suggested steps down from the doorway to a floor at a lower level. Excavation inside the door-way brought out the much decayed remains of gypsum steps originally perhaps 4 in number going down E and if on the analogy of the Throne-room Light Well we have to postulate a landing at the bottom of these then there must have been 2 further steps down S into the area itself, in the interval between the end of the N. balustrade and the edge of the E balustrade opposite. The short (N) balustrade itself flanking this flight of steps to right was in an extremely decayed and worn condition but on its surface having been carefully swept the contour of the column-base in relief on it like those of the E and S balustrades was brought out with sufficient clearness to make the existence of a column at the extremity of this balustrade quite certain. The arrangement is thus even more elaborate than that of the Throne Room light well, there having been 5 column, here for 3 there.60 A more complete picture of the finds discovered can be obtained through a series of sketch-plans, made by Evans, where the positions of the fetishes, horns of consecration and terracotta were drawn in: 'On the gypsum ledge at the South end, in the space between the pillar base on this side and the 58 DM/DB 3.V-20.V.05, 66-8 59 DM/DB 4.V.05, 69-70. 60 DM/DB 5.V.05, 71-2</page><page sequence="25">THE EXCAVATION i3 inner wall, there rested - with traces of the usual pebbles round - horns of consecration.'

The discovery of certain objects found within the sunken area of Room 17, was recorded by Evans who noted the following in the 1905 BSA Report: 'these relics included convex crystal disks like those of the Royal Gaming Board, part of an exquisite faience vase with nautilus reliefs, and two or three corkscrew curls of bronze of larger size but otherwise resembling those inserted in the heads of the animated ivory figurines in the Palace'.62 Room 12: the Anteroom to the Shrine63 The Anteroom to the Shrine (plan 10), as Room 12 became known, was excavated immediately after Room 17: Flanking the Colonnaded Light Well [Room 17] to N. is an apartment 4.45 metres EW and 3.45 NS. This room was found to have an entrance into it from the N. Megaron [Room 9] by a door- way at the N. end of its E. wall .78 wide. It had access to an apartment W. of it (still unexcavated) by means of a door-way at the S. end of its W. wall. It further had access to the Colonnaded Light Well by way of a door- way at the W. end of its S. Wall .64-. 74 wide while a similar doorway at the E. end of the same wall led into what was later the closed corridor flanking the Light Well in the E. These two latter door-ways must have had the functions not merely of access to the light well but of lighting the room itself as well. The S. wall of the room may have had a window as well but this was not proved. The double use of doorways as ways of access and for lighting purposes has full illustration in the palace in the region of the 'Queen's Megaron' in that of the 'Hall of the Double- axes' and elsewhere. The room has only been partially excavated the NW. part still remaining encumbered with deposit. The area to the N. and W. are also entirely unexcavated at the Minoan level though the surface deposit down to this level has been already removed. The position of the doorway at the N. end of the E. wall is noticeable. This position was the most favourable towards the lighting of the N. part of the room indirectly from the Megaron which itself was amply lit from the verandah to E of it [Room 10] if not also by means of a window in the facade to N. of it. The door-way at the S. end of the W. wall of the room as well as that at the E. end of the S. wall came out as the result of supplementary investigation much after the excavation had come to an end. The room did not yield any finds requiring special remark but its position made it clear that it was of a private or semi-private character as compared with the great apartment adjacent to it and the Colonnaded light-well on the E. Side. The Colonnaded Light Well has to be put into relation with this private part of the house in the same way and with the same functions as the open Verandah and the Au^r| in relation to the public part of the building.64 Mackenzie obviously neglected to record the discovery of sealings in Room 12, which were listed by Evans in his 1905 excavation notebook, as coming from the 'R. N. of Shrine'.65 The nw corner of the room must have been cleared in 1908; however no detailed reference was made in the notebooks. Staircase 32: the Main Staircase Mackenzie never recorded the excavation of Staircase 32, although this was included in one of his sketches (plan 9; plates 1-2). A 'curious wall flanking the lower landing to the right as one ascends the stair' was reported and sun-dried bricks were 'found in situ' nearby (plate 6 c).66 Evans noted that in this part of the building 'many traces of upper stories are visible, one of the walls presenting very visible remains of its sun-dried brick construction'. He also noted that 'two flights and remains of a third were preserved, though they had sunk considerably beneath the original level'.67 Finally Mackenzie marked the find places of sealings along the lower and upper flights of the staircase. In 1931, when large parts of the building were reconstructed by Evans a lentoid seal of black steatite depicting a male head in profile on one face and a profile bull's head on the other was found 'beneath the slab of the 4th step in the lower flight of stairs'. The seal, CAÍ*? 1 1. 3 no. 13 (HM 1419), was associated with MM III/LM I pottery.68 61 Evans 1904-5, 1 1. 62 Evans 1904-5, 12. tì3 Nomenclature: In AE/NB 1905, Room 12 is referred to as 'R.

Equally brief are the remarks on the fill within the rooms which were described as similar to those within Room 19 (Room of the Fetish). Furthermore, for the first time since the excavation of the building had started, some reference was made to the pottery found: ... the sketch for Tuesday 2nd May illustrates the system of rooms adjacent - W., SW. and S - to the 'Room of the Fetish'. The deposit resembled that of the latter room and clay seals in less or greater quantities were found in all these of them. The pottery found was also invariably of the same Late Minoan III character as elsewhere in the house. At the time of excavation the rooms were taken to the doorless basements and it was only subsequent investigation that brought out the fact of the existence of the doorways indicated on the sketch in question. The 'Room of the Fetish' communicates with the room to W. of it by a doorway .76-.86 wide at the N. end of the dividing wall between these two rooms. Some light may have got into the inner room by way of this doorway but it is probable that the room was also more efficiently lighted through some window-arrangement with the adjacent colonnaded Light Well. The inner room communicated with the room to S of it by a door-way .68--78 wide at the W. end of the dividing wall between the two rooms. This room is so far away both from the Colonnaded Light Well and the auÀr| that it must have been one of the darkest rooms in the house. The room to the S of the 'Room of the Fetish' had communication with the latter room by a door-way .70-.80 wide at the W. end of the dividing wall between the two rooms. Some light got in by the doorway but there may have been also a window in the E. wall of the room communicating with the au^r|. The proportions of these rooms are given on the sketch. The doorways were blocked up in the reoccupation period. A similar system of rooms had to be assumed for the upper floor.70 Rooms 21, 22 and the West Facade Although Rooms 21 and 22 were only partly excavated during this year, no reference to their excavation was made in the subsequent excavation seasons (plans 9-10; plates 10-11). However, the position of 'LM III cups' along the e end of Room 22 was noted by both excavators in their notebooks. In addition Evans reported two sealings from the 'E end of the cup room'.71 The 1905 season ended with the discovery of the top five courses of the West Facade's s end: The system W wards of these 4 rooms is also seen on sketch Tuesday 2nd May. The system consists of two rooms marked as only partially excavated running EW and flanked W-wards by a wall which on the outer W. face is of ashlar limestone masonry and must therefore be either the W. facade of the building as a whole or the E. wall of a light well. In favour of a light-well is the block apparently in position at x which would indicate a return W. Against the probability of a light well is the small return at xx of a character quite usual for a facade but as yet so far as Knossos is concerned unknown for a light well. On the upper floor corresponding with the two rooms mentioned above there probably was one large room equal in size to that of the lower rooms taken together! This upper room probably had a window looking out on the facade or the light-well at the N end of its W wall. We have already postulated a large upper room of square shape adjacent E to this room. The grand proportions of the staircase have much more significance in relation to two such large rooms on the upper floor than it would to a complex of closets like those on the ground floor which themselves were probably hardly more than storerooms or common sleeping rooms. If the wall of ashlar masonry is a facade then the limits of the house have been defined in three directions to the N., to the W., and to the S. If we turn to the sketch for Saturday 29th April we shall see that the limits of the house N wards are indicated by the gypsum block in position on a limestone stylobate which appears at the top of the sketch. Each such gypsum block construction on a limestone stylobate are characteristic of facade construction as illustrated by the W facade of the Palace. The S. limits of the building again are very clearly indicated by a line of gypsum blocks in position on a limestone stylobate as seen on the sketch for Tuesday 2nd May at the bottom of the page. The ashlar masonry in limestone if taken for the W facade of the house presents an ambiguity which can only be cleared up through further excavation for the usual tradition for outside facades is gypsum above the stylobate not limestone as here. The limits to the E are unfortunately not nearly so clear for here the rather steep slope down E has been unfavourable to the preservation of the remains and later builders have been particularly busy just in the area where the E front of the building probably came.72 m DM/DB 1 rs-v-2o.v.ofs and 22.V-27.V.05. 70 DM/DB 15.v-20.v-05, 77. 71 AE/NB 1905, 9. 72 DM/D522.V.-27.V.05, 79-80.</page><page sequence="27">THE EXCAVATION i5 THE 1908 EXCAVATION SEASON Introduction Excavation was resumed in mid- April and ended in early June.73 Without delay, the orientation of the wagers was changed since the building was running N-s, instead of nne-ssw, which was the alignment set up during the 1905 season. The work of clearing up the area referred to proceeded rapidly because it had been partially excavated in 1905 but once we got away from this partially excavated region in the S. W. and N. directions the work of excavation involved enormous labour and trouble. Great sections had to be made alternately in all these directions and these sections varied from 2 and 3 to over 6 meters before floor-levels were reached as the slope goes down rather rapidly E wards the great depths were towards the W. and the least towards the E. As we know from our excavations of 1905 recent deposit and then Roman and Greek remains had to be penetrated before reaching the Minoan level and the cemented Roman walls which occurred everywhere gave very great trouble. The whole work down to the Minoan deposits had to be made on the rapid system of wagers. Inside the area covered by the house there was never any risk of getting into the Minoan deposits unaware because while the later debris was always of a pale clayey colour the Minoan earth was characterised by its ruddy tawny colour. Our men were always on the watch for it and each gang of a set of wagers was anxious to declare the fact at once of having arrived at the Minoan deposits in order to get itself put down as first in the wagers. The trenches had originally been set out from SW to NE in order to come upon the continuation of the great roadway from the Palace which was what we were in search of in 1905 when we accidentally came upon this important building. The new trenches had to be arranged so as to run parallel with the main lines of the house i.e. NS and EW.74 The sequence in which the rooms were investigated is impossible to reconstruct, mainly because of the summary nature of most DM/DB entries. However, these together with several references in AE/ NB indicate that Rooms 28-30 and Staircase 34 were at least partly uncovered before the wagers had progressed onto the Minoan levels along the SW Sector (plan 12). The 1908 DM/DB entries are of a rather summary nature, with gaps of up to ten days between two accounts. The wagers were presumably progressing slowly, but work was at the same time concentrated on other parts of Knossos, namely along the South Front of the Palace, the outcome of which was the discovery of the South House. Excavation of the LP Facade Walls Initially, work concentrated on the south end of the West Facade, part of which had already been exposed in the previous season (plans 9-13). Here, the excavators had sound reasons to hope for some indoor feature: In the campaign of 1908 excavations in the W. House were resumed at the point at which they had been left off towards the end of May 1905. One interesting feature brought out in that excavation on the western limits of the area then excavated had been a wall running NS with fine face of ashlar masonry in limestone on the W. Side. The question left unsolved at that time was whether this fine wall was the outside back wall of the house on the west side or whether it was not rather the east facade of a small central court or rather large light-well. The ashlar masonry in limestone closely resembled that of the light wells of the Palace and there was also one feature which seemed to tell rather in favour of its being a light well than an internal court. This was that beneath the fourth course of ashlar masonry there appeared an interval in the construction like that in the light- wells of the palace into which a horizontal beam of wood had been let. This system of construction in the Palace when combined with arrangements in limestone had always been characteristic of the light wells whereas in external constructions like the E and N Bastions it was absent. This fact confirmed us in the idea that our fine wall in ashlar masonry must also be an internal arrangement. There was, however, one disturbing fact. On calculating the level of the ground-floors in the interior of the house further E. it was seen that the level of our wood-work came to be too low to answer to the function performed by it within the Palace except in that particular case when it passes underneath window sills. In our case we had wood-work which could have passed underneath a window sill but as there were from 3 to 4 courses of ashlar masonry the corresponding window did not exist at the point at which the woodwork occurred. The window might exist further N. or further S but that we had still to find out.75 73 In 1906 there were no excavations since a study season took place, whilst during the 1907 campaign work was concentrated mainly on the Palace site. 74 DM/DB 20.iv.08, 75-6. 75 DM/DB [no date] 1908, 69.</page><page sequence="28">i6 THE EXCAVATION From April 1 3 Mackenzie was deeply involved in the excavation of the s end of the West Facade especially where it corners with the North Storage Room Facade (plans 11-12): About 8 meters of this wall had been brought out in 1 905 but in no part had the ground-floor level been reached. For this reason we did not know at what level in the construction the wood-work had come. It remained now to find out this. At x is a slight return such as is characteristic of external construction hardly ever of internal and at 3.65 south of this is an angle shown at xx. Of the new wall running W only one block was brought out in 1905 and this was in gypsum - another disturbing fact for an internal light- well system. It was at this point that operations were started this season. As there was a considerable depth of deposit a good deal of it Roman and later we worked by the system of wagers stopping these at once when we arrived at the golden coloured Minoan earth. The wagers we set out N-wards and W-wards from the angle marked as xx. At this angle we reached the floor-level at once and this was found to be at a depth of only .46 from the gypsum block referred to and of .72 from the level of the wood beam interval mentioned above. The floor level is at a depth of 2.15 from the top-most preserved course of the limestone ashlar wall. The ashlar masonry rests on a low projecting plinth in limestone, the projection being 6 to 6 1/2 centimetres. Along side of the plinth is rough limestone paving and this at the angle is at the same level as the plinth whereas a little distance away in the N direction the paving is at a somewhat lower level. This arrangement was evidently made on purpose with a view to facilitating the flow away N-wards of the rain water. The gypsum construction running W does not have this plinth but instead of that it has narrow slabs of limestone set along its foot which were apparently meant to preserve the gypsum from the effects of damp. These slabs are 1 2 centimetres wide and they have an interval of about 4 centimetres between them and the wall which was probably originally filled up with some kind of cement of which, however, now there is no trace.76 By April 18 the window long the North Storage Room Facade was fully exposed together with a rubble wall which blocked the Paved Passage from Space R (plans 11-12): The E. part of this wall as far as a the shallow return at xxx has its lowest course of gypsum blocks. Above this at the W. end at xxx a narrow upright block in limestone is preserved in position. The arrangement has the appearance of a window lighting rooms or corridors S of the gypsum construction. The gypsum course is 50 cm high, the high narrow limestone block at xxx also .56 high. W of the small return at xxx the construction is of limestone, and the E. most block of the second course has the return included in it and projects onto the gypsum construction for .29. Part of three courses of this construction is preserved going up to 1 .68 from its base. The blocks are of very fine limestone and resemble the best ashlar construction in the light-wells and bastions of the Palace. The fine construction could be traced W-wards for 2.72 from the small return already referred to. Ajoining NS near the return was brought out a rough rubble wall which was a complete contrast to the ashlar construction and as at its S. end it was built right up against, this it could be seen at once that the rubble wall was a later construction blocking up the passage E &amp; W. At the N. end of this rough wall and at a distance of 2.60 from its S. end another rough but more solidly built wall runs N &amp; W with a corner at xxxx. The part of the wall running N is at a distance of 3 M from the ashlar construction with the wood work referred to previously and is as great a contrast to the ashlar construction as the other is. The whole at once made the impression of an inferior arrangement set up by squatters on the spot after the house itself had fallen into ruins. This was at any rate true of the wall running and coming up against the fine ashlar wall at xxx.77 After a week's digging more parts of the ashlar wall were gradually traced out on both n and w directions. Despite the discovery of a rough rubble wall of inferior construction expectations becoming greater in hope of having discovered a small Central Court. By the time the fine ashlar stepped facade of the MUM had been traced out it had become obvious that no Central Court was to be discovered. Mackenzie must have been slightly disappointed by the excavation results and consequently his interest moved towards the interior of the building. This misinterpretation, however, can partly explain the name 'Petit Palais' which had been given to the 'West House' before the start of the 1 908 excavation season. The wagers widened simultaneously the area excavated to S and W and N. The more work proceeded the more clear it became that the fine wall in ashlar masonry running NS with repeated returns was the back wall of the house. When the SW angle at x and the NW angle at xx came out there could be no longer any doubt of this. No doorway appeared throughout the entire length of the facade. S of the return W with fine ashlar masonry referred to already only one or two courses of masonry are preserved. The N half of the facade has from 3 to 7 courses in situ. After the angle xx is turned there are 2 courses above the plinth in gypsum, the third course is in limestone.

There is a gap in this system at o-o and only at one point xxx is any of the limestone superstructure preserved. (2 blocks of first course 1 block of second). There is a further gap in the orthostatic system at xxxx-x.78 Initially Mackenzie was convinced that 'inside the area covered by the house there was never any risk of getting into the Minoan deposits unaware, because while the later debris was always of a pale clayey colour the Minoan earth was characterised by its ruddy tawny colour'.79 However, later he commented on the difficulties of the excavation since 'the deposits were everywhere very much disturbed and this disturbance seemed to be partly the work of the latest inhabitants of the house partly the work of people in search of building materials or treasure after the house had become a ruin'.80 The Minoan Unexplored Mansion and the Little Palace/Minoan Unexplored Mansion Bridge The complete excavation of the MUM East Facade dissolved Mackenzie's last hopes for a central court arrangement (plan 13): Ever since the fine wall with E face in stepped back ashlar masonry began to come out the centre of interest was more outside than inside the area covered by the W. House. As already remarked it was not at first noticed that this wall did not run parallel with the NS walls of our house but diverged somewhat in its orientation so as to go NNE-SSW. The wagers, however, gradually brought out the entire length of the wall and then the divergence in orientation referred was quite evident. What we had to do with was apparently not the W. limit of a central court to our house but the E (terrace?) wall of another house' (plan 13; plate 8).H1 Work also progressed along the West Storage Room Facade, which was excavated at the same time as the Bridge which connects the LP to the MUM. The N end of the Facade had been robbed off whereas the Bridge was taken to be an LM III arrangement. Further digging revealed part of the Roman House of the Diamond Frescoes together with the E half of the MUM Room Q (plan 13): The building clearly shows a NE and a SE corner and the fine ashlar masonry was continuous throughout the part visible in the section. The entire length of the wall is 23.10 but there is a break near the N end where later people had sunk a pit in the clay. In the S. half is a bastion like arrangement projecting out E. to very near the W. facade of the W. House. This bastion had its E. face cut away at a later time (LM III) apparently to make room for a wide shallow stone drain which passes S between the two houses. The bastion was cut away in a manner to suit the orientation of the drain. The cutting away has left rough faces next to the drain which are quite unlike the good faces of the wall further N &amp; S. The bit of wall inside the bastion in line with the main wall is rough and this fact in itself offers indication that this was originally interior wall not meant to be visible. A special wager sunk so as to get inside the SE angle of the house soon came upon a Roman house and one well preserved room of this showed wall-painting representing different coloured stones in panels. Beneath this room with an interval between came out a cross wall running W. at the W. end of this wall a gypsum doorjamb appeared and we were thus able to see that we were actually in the interior of a house of which our ashlar wall represented the E. Facade.82 Rooms 28-35: the Magazines and the West Staircase This particular section of the building was cleared out after the facade walls had been traced out (plans 12-13; plates 8-9). On April 1 Mackenzie commented on the discovery of Staircase 34 (West Staircase), the two pits and the Roman well immediately to the se. The Staircase was lit by a window along the first landing: The other suggested window is near the S. end of the W. facade of the house at xxx and such a window would have been necessary towards the lighting of the adjoining stairway. One flight of this stairway is almost entirely preserved not with-standing the fact that a Roman well was sunk just alongside of its lowest steps and on the S. side of these. Adjoining the stairway on the S. are two rectangular walled pits a &amp; b and in one of these - a - an important discovery was made. At about 1 meter to 1 .45 from the top preserved course of the construction were found the fragments of a bull's head in steatite. The fragments showed that the work stood very high artistically.

The right eye with its eye-ball in crystal having the pupil painted behind was intact. The ears and horns were gone. The head was in the form of a rhyton and almost half the size of life. The rectangular pit b and adjoining spaces were deliberately searched but nothing further was found.83 At a later date, during a more thorough search of the region for additional fragments of the steatite bull's head rhyton significant deposits where discovered: For some time we had been engaged in clearing up obscure points in the interior of the W House. Several of the doorways blocked up by the later people in the region behind the house-shrine and to S. of that were now opened up. Alongside of that a diligent search was made on the floors in the area where was found the bull's head in steatite with the hope of coming upon stray fragments of that. It was in connection with this search that we came upon several important fragments of vases (jars amphorae) of the Palace Style in the corridor N of the W. stair. In the adjoining spaces further N. (2 and entrance to 1) were found the fragments of a gourd-vase with curious loop design in relief and waving pattern in the flat. (LM II) (Compare large jar with relief work from Royal Villa).84 Additional information on these deposits is given at plan 12. Here the fragments of the 'gourd-vase' (fig. 4.32: 20, plate 2ob-d) were marked scattered in the E end of Rooms 28 and 29. Further s and in the region of the dividing wall for Room 30 and the upper flight of Staircase 34, the position of a 'jar with papyrus (rim)' (fig. 4.32: 5) and 'amphora with net (shoulder) work design' (fig. 4.32: 4) were indicated. Finally 'fragments of bull's head rhyton in terracotta - LM IF (fig. 4.32: 3, plate 21 a-b) were discovered along the E end of Staircase 34 upper flight. In addition to all these, a stepped socket steatite base and two alabastra were reported in Evans 1914: . . . the remains of a stepped socket were found in the pit on the south side of the staircase, in the company with the greater part of a magnificent rhyton of inlaid steatite in the form of a bull meanwhile in the bordering staircase area came to light another bull's head rhyton of painted ware, and two alabastra of the same material.85 Despite the wealth of vessels recovered, on June 17, Mackenzie made the following comment on the nature of the deposits in this part of the building: Throughout the area covered by the W. House and the interval between it and the new building the greatest confusion prevailed everywhere in the deposit. The pottery next the floor levels was for the most part LM III while here and there occurred fragments of fine Palace Style pottery such as those of a handsome tall jar with graceful reed-like plant design in very fine brown-black glaze on a buff ground. But it was characteristic that the fragments of this vase were found scattered over the whole area outside the SW. angle of the W. House and no amount of pains could enable us to uncover as many fragments as could enable us to set up the vase. This vase was apparently typical of the LM II Period when the house was at its prime previous to its reoccupation &amp; remodelling by the later people.86 Room 36: the South West Pillar Room The room was cleared out after much of Staircase 34 and Rooms 28-30 further to the N had been uncovered (plan 13; plate 7 b). However, the discovery of this room was only briefly commented in DM/DB: The large room inside the SW-angle of the house apart from its size which was exceptional compared with that of the maze of rooms further N. revealed a feature of exceptional interest in the shape of two pillars indicating a shrine at the same time that they probably supported columns on the upper floor. The region W of the front stair excavated in 1 905 was the most difficult to understand at the same time that it was the worst preserved. In addition as seen on plan 13, Mackenzie noted the position of a 'lead female figurine' beside the south facade wall (plate 22 0, fig. 5.2: i).87 For most of our information on the room we have to rely on Evans 1914 where an extended version of a few notes made in 1908 was published:88 83 DM/DB i.iv.08, 70. 84 DM/DB 15-24.vi.08, 85. 85 Evans 1914, 72-4- For a reference to the squat alabastron, the steatite and clay rhyta, AE/NB 1908, 8. m Z&gt;M/Z&gt;5i7.vi.o8, 84. 87 DM/DB in.vi.oS, 82. 88 AE/NB 1908, 9.</page><page sequence="31">THE EXCAVATION ig Above the lower courses of the south wall of this pillar-chamber, and evidently fallen from above, was discovered a leaden female figure of rude fabric in the attitude of adoration. From its uncouth style this figure must be ascribed to the latest Minoan Age; the attitude indeed recalls that of the terra-cotta figure found in the late Palace shrine of the Double Axes. We may perhaps infer that some small shrine of a similar character had been set up in this quarter of the Palace by the later occupants to whom the 'Fetish Shrine' to the north was due.89 On the architecture and on the two pillars, in particular, Evans remarked that . . . their surface had suffered a good deal from the effects of conflagration. There was no trace in any case of any stone receptacle between the pillar, and whatever cult objects or vessels for libation may have been originally placed here had been cleared out with the rest of its contents at a time when a restoration of the upper story was apparently in view. The evidence of this was found in two large piles of unbaked bricks stacked at the eastern end of the room. This material was largely for the upper structure of the building.90 The piles of unbaked bricks, which appear to have been raised to the same height as the south pillar, are clearly visible in plate 7 b. Room 31: the Light Well Some sections of this room (plan 13; plate 7 ¿), which was taken for a light well, must have been excavated in 1905, since the following are recorded in the 1908 DM/DB: The region W of the front stair excavated in 1905 was the most difficult to understand at the same time that it was the worst preserved. At length, however, the N &amp; W. walls were brought out and these were sufficiently well preserved to show parts in ashlar masonry. Thus we could see that what we had to do with was a light-well with a window at the N-end of its W. wall. It probably had more important functions in relation to adjoining rooms on the upper floor. There probably was originally a window from this light-well lighting the second flight (up N). of the adjoining stair on the E. side.91 Rooms 15 and 16 Both rooms (plan 13; plate 10 a) seem to have been cleared out during this season, however, there is only a brief and indirect reference made towards the end of the season's digging: For some time we had been engaged in clearing up obscure points in the interior of the W. House. Several of the doorways blocked up by the later people in the region behind the house-shrine and to S. of that were now opened up.92 Nevertheless, the identification of 'the region behind the house shrine' with these two rooms remains problematic as well as Mackenzie's references to blocked doorways in this region. Room 14 and Corridor 13 The rooms immediately within the nw corner of the LP where probably amongst the last areas to be explored (plan 10; plate 10 a): Meantime just at the close some supplementary clearing brought out the true character of the NW. room of the house. The east part of this had been blocked up by a massive wall of later date (LM III). This we resolved to remove and on having done so we were able uncover a short corridor with steps up N. &amp; then W. into the room the corridor was lit by a facade window at the N. end. Alongside the first flight of steps and to right of these was a sort of door-window through which apparently some indirect light was meant to pass into the back part of the adjoining room on the E. side.93 Evans made a rough sketch of a small fresco fragment discovered 'In Corridor behind Shrine fragments of painted stucco black spirals on white paint with red terracotta ground. Also few black spirals on white ground with red and yellow border in ,..'94 A more elaborate description was given in PM II: 'Within this passage, lit at its Northern end by a small window of which the gypsum sill remained, were found fragments of painted stucco, showing black spirals on a white ground with lozenge-shaped intervals banded red and yellow. The fragments probably belonged to this 'North-West Room', the 89 Evans 1914, 74. 90 Evans 1914, 74. 91 DM/DB 17.vi.05, 82. 92 DM/DB 15.iv-24.iv.08, 85. 93 DM/DB 17. vi.08, 82. 1)4 AE/NB 1908, 10.</page><page sequence="32">2O THE EXCAVATION walls of which still show a good deal of the coarser backing of a fresco surface adhering to them'. A further note was made on the style of some fragments which reveals Evans's preoccupation in defining 're-occupation' features amongst the LP finds: 'Some inferior fragments were also found here showing degenerate papyrus decoration, and perhaps belonging to the period of Re-occupation: no other remains of wall-painting except of most fragmentary kind were found in the building.'95 Room n: the Lavatory Despite its paved floor and fitted drain, the discovery of the so-called 'Lavatory' was never reported in DM/DB. However, the room was almost certainly dug up in 1908, since it is included on plan 13, drawn in that year. THE BASEMENT AND THE 1910 EXCAVATION SEASON The Basement was an unexpected discovery made during the last day of the 1 908 excavation season (plan 14; plates 1 fl, 2 4, 4 a-b). Evans and Mackenzie's intention was to discover a possible entrance to the LP from the East Front. Thus a wager was laid in the area sw of Room 37, by which the nw of the Basement became exposed, including Staircase 4 and the n half of Room 3: After all these floor deposits had been excavated and the house cleared out and swept the excavation was considered to be at an end. Then, however, we began to consider the relation of the house to the roadway, which we knew to pass in front of it at a lower level. How did the occupants of the house get down to and up from the roadway? We had found no connection between the one and the other at any point. The features brought out in 1905 in the SE region of the house led us to think that the entrance must be sought in this quarter. Here accordingly, we thought we must look for the means (a stairway) by which people got up from the level of the road to the ground-floor of the house. In line E. wards accordingly from the S. apartments of the house and S-wards from the region of what we took to be a sort of lobby with peristyle we arranged a series of wagers. The area covered by these wagers will be understood by reference to the last sketch (8 pages back). The rectangular pit thus sunk to our surprise went down and down without any sign of a stair. In the N. half however the tops of walls began to occur at a depth of 1.10 below the level of the adjoining floors. These walls in turn went down to a floor level 2.80 below the floors already referred to. The doorjambs and other features brought out such as a house-pillar (lower block) in limestone showed that we had once more to do with interior construction one floor deeper than the main floors of the W. House. A massive wall brought out near the W. edge of our pit had its E. face lining up with the E. face of the wall going N. alongside of the adjoining stair and to E of that. This fact would indicate that the new system was in direct relation with that of the house and was one with that. It further came out that a cutting on the N &amp; W sides had been made by the builders into which our system had been fitted. A house pillar has been mentioned as part of the system S of this is a limestone cist and this fact led Mr. Evans to think that a pillar corresponding to the one already referred must exist S. of the unit and equidistant out from it with the other. By a little scraping the pillar in three limestone blocks appeared in the section. Thus our work for the season ended with the knowledge that we had not yet completely excavated our W. House.9fi After a year's gap excavation was resumed in 1910. Work lasted throughout May, as excavation progressed slowly due to the deep deposits, which were superimposed upon this section of the building. Moreover, excavation of other sites such as the Isopata cemetery was currently taking place. Consequently, there are only four DM/DB entries covering a period of more than one month's work. In these much discussion is spent on the architectural features uncovered rather than on recording deposits and small finds. The impression obtained from the nature of the entries is that the Basement was for most of the time excavated in the absence of the two directors, with Mackenzie occasionally visiting the site and updating his DM/DB entries, after the end of a wager's work. The poor state of preservation of the LP, especially along the s half of Room 7 and Room 6B, discouraged Evans and Mackenzie from hoping for well preserved Minoan remains. Building activity and stone robbing during post-Minoan times had much affected this particular area. Two rectangular wagers were set out immediately s of the 1908 wager which revealed the s pillar in Room 3, the n face of which had already appeared along the s section of the 1908 wager: 95 PM II, 524 and note 3. 96 DM/DB 15.vi.08, 85-6.</page><page sequence="33">THE EXCAVATION 21 On the last day of the excavations of 1 908 we found that the system brought out in the deep area SE of the Petit Palais continued E &amp; S and that it would not be possible to bring out the whole in its entirety until later on. The most important feature brought out had been the limestone base-block of a rectangular pillar similar to the one of the Palace and to a pair in a room of the Petit Palais itself further W. At a short interval to S of this pillar base was a rectangular cist in limestone narrowed below into a narrower cist. These cists in an analogous position are characteristic of such Pillar Rooms and they occur in the Palace and in the N Room of the Royal Villa. The Pillars usually occur in pairs and on measuring S of the cist a distance equal to that between it and the pillar base before mentioned the N face of a second pillar was noticed fairly partly in view in the section E and W made by our wagers. This discovery was made by Mr. Evans on the afternoon of his departure from Crete. The importance of the system and the necessity of future operations here thus became at once clear. At the same time a pair of gypsum door-jambs were just visible on the E. side at the bottom of a wager section running NS. The system could thus be seen to extend not only S but E and it was accordingly in these directions that our future operations would have to be extended. The construction as brought out in 1908 are shown on the opposite sketch. Apart from the Pillar Base and Cist the most interesting feature brought out was the narrow stair up N. at 5.97 As more parts of the Basement were being uncovered, Mackenzie regularly remarked on the traces of the terracing made in the soft kouskouras by the Minoan builders. An interesting fact had come out in the excavations at the Petit Palais in 1908 which brought out the Pillar bases and the cist. This was that the system to which the Pillar bases belonged had being built into a cutting in the soft rock in such a way that its floors were a storey deeper than in the Petit Palais. We found that the W. and N. walls of the system (at 1 &amp; 2 on the sketch) were built against the soft rock or 'kouskouras' and we were able to trace out this quite clearly. The question now was where the cutting going S with face E would itself turn E and thus give the probable southern limits of the house, that is to say we had to discover a SW angle corresponding to the NW angle. The cutting going E with face S which formed the N limit of the system would be traced out later. Our starting point was the S. Pillar brought out in the wager section of 1908. In the area S. of this we accordingly lay ed out two rectangular wagers running NS in order to arrive at the S. limits of the house. The position of the SW. angle was the first definite fact that came out and behind this the soft clay rock was found to take a turn E. see sketch 3. In front of the cutting of clay-rock massive terracing wall had been built similar to that on the W. side and this had been solidly filled up behind against the clay-rock. The whole thickness of the wall was 1.05. At first we were rather disturbed by finding a massive wall running E from the W. wall of the system at a point marked 4 on the sketch. This was found to be built up against the terrace wall instead of locking into it but we had later to reflect that walls are usually built up against terrace walls in precisely this fashion without being necessarily of late date or an addition to the system. The S. Pillar which was always visible in the section was brought out in its entirety. It consisted of two high blocks above a somewhat wider base-block all of limestone. The Pillar was found to have a perceptible lean E. and this was later explained through the discovery of a late wall alongside of its base in the SE. Side. The constructions in the SW. angle of the house were found to consist of a short corridor going S to the foot of a stair going up W. of this stair 3 gypsum steps are preserved. (Only 2 and third is in limestone).98 A second set of wagers begun further E as the pair of gypsum doorjambs, between Rooms 3 and 1, became exposed at the bottom of the wager section: The SW. angle with clay rock behind which was brought out in the first set of wagers gave us the probable limits S-ward of the whole system. Our next set of wagers was laid out alongside of this part on its E. border. The W. limits of the wagers coincided with the doorway at 1 and the doorjamb at 2. Along this line was the old section of 1908 and all that lay to E of it had still to be explored. The system brought out in these new wagers is represented by the constructions to E of the line indicated by 1,2 on the sketch. The most remarkable feature brought out was a low pillar base 3 corresponding to the Pillar 4. To S. of it was a cist 5 but to this there corresponded no similar cist to 5 of pillar 4. To the N of the pillar base referred to a second cist came into view very much chipped above and shifted somewhat to E. of its true position + (A subsequent excavation of the clay-rock floor brought out clearly the fact that the cist had been shifted E - of its true symmetrical position N. of pillar 3 and sunk more deeply in the floor than it had been originally). The wall 1-2 forms a separation between the E &amp; the W Pillars but it is possible [it] did not exist on the upper floor. In that case the upper floor arrangement may have been a large hall with 4 columns supported on the 97 DM/DB 30.iv.10, 24-5. ■w DM/DB 2- 14.V. 10, 26-7.</page><page sequence="34">2 2 THE EXCAVATION 4 pillars of the basement rooms. The S wall of the system which was built against the clay-rock was found to continue E in one base course. It is evident that the masonry had been removed by the later builders adjoining on the E. whose constructions have done such damage to the E. Front of the Petit Palais further N. The same is true of the N. wall adjoining the 'lobby' of the Petit Palais. This beyond the angle brought out in 1908 continued E-ward in one course faced with gypsum slabs above a ledge like base course of somewhat rough ashlar blocks. The course of masonry with good face S. at 6 and 2 blocks of a second course just N of the foundations of the N Pillar also continues E-ward. The area N. of it may have been a sort of basement magazine. It does not seem to have had any exit W-ward." But even these wagers failed to reach the eastern borders of the Basement, so yet again a new set of wagers was required in order to reveal the east end of the system. Mackenzie commented extensively on the poorly preserved deposits and archaeological remains of Room 1 . The wagers by means of which the E. Pillar Room was brought into view did not include the E wall of this. Accordingly a new set of wagers was arranged going NS the whole length of the system and extending E-wards 4.40. The remains at the Minoan level were very badly preserved and it was clear that later builders had been very busy on the spot. At first sight on arriving at the floor level there seemed nearly little hope of finding any certain trace of the E-wall by the system under the mass of later walls. These and the deposits connected with them went down to the floor level itself and it was apparent that not only Minoan construction but also much Minoan deposit had disappeared as a result. It was only as the outcome of subsequent investigations after the wagers were completed that the wall-foundations going NS were brought out which appear on the opposite sketch as 1-1. The wall is very poorly preserved. The SE corner stone is a fine limestone block but the rest of the wall has been very much disturbed and only a few foundations stones occur above the clay rock. There is a gap at 2 and N of this the rough foundations continue to NE angle at 3. We have not been able to trace out any walls belonging to our system to E. of this wall and the probable conclusion is that it itself formed the E wall of the house. We cannot be absolutely certain that there was no entrance at 2 or indeed elsewhere along the course of the foundations but it is more likely that it was continuous. It will be remembered that the N. wall of the system 4 is backed by clay-rock and it now turned out that the wall turned N at 5. It thus looked as if here we might discover a bond of connection between the system with the four pillars and Petit Palais itself. We accordingly set out two wagers to E. of 6 with the result that the cutting in the clay-rock was found to turn N. with the wall. The cutting had a low projecting ledge at its foot and on to this the terrace wall had apparently been built. The late walls which are so abundant further N. came into evidence here and little or nothing of the Minoan system could be traced out to N. of 5. The seasons work had to finish without our being able positively to establish the connection between the system of the Four Pillars and the 'Petit Palais' and without our succeeding in discovering the entrance to this.100 The find places of pottery and small finds recorded by Evans and Mackenzie are shown in plan 53. 99 DM/DBi6-28.v.io, 28-9. 100 DM/DB 30.V.-1.VÌ.10, 30-1.</page><page sequence="35">Chapter 2 The Little Palace according to Evans and Mackenzie THE DEFINITION OF LATE PALACE AND RE-OCCUPATION PERIOD POTTERY The study of any ceramic group from Evans's excavations has to confront problems generated by his excavation methods and goals.1 Central to the comprehension of any pottery account written by Evans or Mackenzie is the understanding of their perception of the stratigraphical sequence on the Kephala Hill. Neglected in this respect is an appreciation of how the terms 'Late Palace Phase' and the succeeding partial 'Re-occupation' apply to the excavators' changing definitions. According to the preliminary report for 1 900, Evans considered the fire which destroyed the Palace and baked hard the inscribed clay tablets as the last event in the building's history. He noted that 'nothing was more striking throughout the excavations than the absence of all remains later than the flourishing Mycenaean period'.2 Mackenzie, however, had already identified 'a somewhat later floor-level' associated with some pithoi in the Area of the South Propylaeum.3 As for the pottery uncovered, this was indiscriminately assigned to 'the mature Mycenaean class, analogous to that found at Mycenae, Ialysos and Tell-el-Amarna'.4 Interestingly, during the first excavation season most complete pots came from the town site; F. B. Welch, who was in charge of the pottery, commented that little had been found on the Palace hill.5 By the end of the following excavation season the amount of material uncovered had drastically increased and the views of Evans and Mackenzie on the sequence of events had become more definite. Although the term 're-occupation' had not yet been introduced, two distinct phases in the occupation of the building were identified, each associated with different types of pottery. In spite of these distinctions, the pottery from both phases was still termed 'Mycenaean'. In a letter to Evans in 1901, Mackenzie outlined the stratigraphie sequence along the Palace mound and convinced his employer about the 'Re-occupation'.6 His theory was to shape our perception of LM III Knossos. In 1902 the term 'Palace Style' was introduced to denote 'the magnificent style of vase-painting prevalent at Knossos in the great days of the Palace',7 which represented 'the most brilliant period of Mycenaean Art'.8 Specimens of this style, which Evans thought to be indigenous to Knossos, were the 'numerous fragments of Mycenaean vases in a peculiarly fine 'Palace Style', which were found collapsed from the upper floor into the West Magazines'. These vases characterised 'the style that was in vogue when this part of the Palace was destroyed'.9 Moreover, the relationship between the motifs applied on the Palace Style jars and the frescoes was noted for the first time.10 A series of vessels discovered in the rooms along the South Front revealed 'a very definite line in the archaeological stratification of the site'. It was here that 'a series of Mycenaean vases of a decidedly more recent type than those of the fine Palace style' were discovered. 'Among the classes represented, besides plain bowls and some rather coarse jars with flowing stroke decoration, were the usual two-handled pedestal cups of the champagne-glass form, single-handled jugs with waved and spiral pattern, and several 'stirrup jars' (Bügelkannen) of high oval form and somewhat heavy fabric, with octopus designs, and large single-handled mugs with incurving sides very characteristic of the tombs 1 The peculiarities and limitations in the study of pottery groups from Evans's excavations at Knossos have been outlined in a number of studies: e.g. Popham 19700, 9; Hallager 1977, 12-16; Momigliano 1991, 154. 2 Evans 1899-1900, 66. 3 DM/DB, 16.iv.00. 4 Evans iSqq-iqoo. 6r. ' 'The bulk of pottery came from the town site: very little was found on Kephala, and it would seem that the inhabitants of the palace had reached such a stage of luxury, that even the best Mycenaean vases were nothing accounted of in the days of Minos': Welch 1899-1900, 91. The same statement was repeated by Evans in the final volume of PM. See PM IV, 353; Popham 1970a, 65.

The sherds published to illustrate the association of pottery with fresco motifs were characterised by a 'distinctly later tendency'. These were described as 'easy to distinguish by a decline to a conventional short-hand method of rendering paint and flower detail which becomes gradually more typical of the decadent period'. Mackenzie's comments illuminate his reluctance to assign certain floral and marine motifs to a particular period; he concluded that 'this pottery often classed as best Mycenaean, already belongs to the beginning of the decadent period'. Certain deposits were, however, firmly assigned to 'beyond the great Palace period'. The occurrence of octopus stirrup jars together with plain kylikes, amphorae and jars was a characteristic feature of such deposits.15 In conclusion, decorated pottery was allocated to a period according to how 'decadent' were the motifs depicted in style in comparison to those of the Palace Style Jars. Stirrup jars with octopus decoration and plain pottery, such as kylikes, champagne cups and storage jars were considered the hallmarks for the 'Re-occupation' and firmly assigned to this period. In 1903, the excavation of the Royal Villa provided additional Later Palace Style material, namely 'two extraordinary fine painted vessels, - a stirrup vase and a tall, handled jar', but also contributed to the volume of decorated pottery assigned to the 're-occupation' period.16 These were published in the preliminary report for 1903 as 'Painted pottery from Royal Villa belonging to the period of partial habitation' and were associated with stirrup jars having 'degraded octopus patterns'. Evans described the contents of Room Hi as follows: . . . this room seems to have remained practically intact at a time when the greater part of the building must have been in ruins, and it thus offered facilities for later "squatters". On its clay floor (itself symptomatic of the age of decline) were found, in fact, a series of "stirrup jars" with degraded octopus patterns. In this quarter of the building there were also found numerous fragments of pottery of the same late character (fig. 92, p. 153) including the upper part of a painted clay "idol" (fig. 92c). Others show a somewhat nearer relation to the "Palace Style", as if the corner of the building had been re-occupied rather soon after the catastrophe.17 The concept of a pottery style earlier than 'the decadent Mycenaean wares of the period of Partial Occupation' and closer to, but more advanced than, the Palace Style was already anticipated in the 19°3 JHS article. Such an intermediate style was first identified by the pottery from the Zapher Papoura cemetery, excavated in 1904: 'the bulk of them belonged to the period immediately succeeding the fall of the Palace'.18 With most parts of the Palace uncovered and a better understanding of the site's stratigraphy and pottery styles, Evans composed, in 1 904, an article entitled 'Preliminary Scheme for the Classification and approximate Chronology of the Periods of Minoan Culture in Crete from the close of the Neolithic to the Early Iron Age'. In this updated version of Mackenzie's JHS article, Evans for the first time divided the Minoan Era into three main periods with three subdivisions in each.19 For the Late Palace Period the term 'Mycenaean' was abandoned. An intermediate style, set between the Palace Style and 11 Evans ìooo-i, 12. 12 'There was no trace in the later chambers and passages of the Southern Terrace basement of an example of the finer Palace style. It will be seen, too, that the room of the Stirrup Vases (Bügelkannen), to the north of the building where similar ceramic types occurred, is now shown to overlay an earlier Mycenaean floor-level. Their sporadic occurrence indeed and proved posteriority make it more and more probable that at the time when the larger part of the Palace, together with the monuments of its most flourishing artistic period was already in ruins': Evans IQOO-I, 12-1S- 13 Evans 1902-3, 3. The article, published in 1903, was 'written at the request of Mr. A. T. Evans': Mackenzie 1903, 1 57 n. 1. 14 'Each succeeding season's excavations have added to the material for coming to a conclusion, and now there is so much at our disposal that it is possible not only to affirm the dominant influence of the style at Knossos during the best period, but also to trace the continuance of that influence into the period of decline': Mackenzie 1903, 194. 15 'This decadent style at Knossos is typical of a period when the palace is only partially inhabited and probably is no longer a royal residence. The Bügelkanne which is rare in the great days of the palace is characteristic of this third period... in the period of partial habitation, all of decoration that remains is in the shape of the occasional groups of horizontal bands, representing the architectonic framework of earlier design... in this latest period thousand of kylix-cups, amphorae and jars exist in this pale yellow clay without any decoration': Mackenzie 1903, 199. 16 Evans 1903-4, 138. 17 Evans 1Q03-4, 141-2. 18 Evans 1904-5, 4. 19 Evans 1905^, 1</page><page sequence="37">THE LITTLE PALACE ACCORDING TO EVANS AND MACKENZIE 25 Re-occupation pottery, was first introduced. Represented by pottery from the Zapher Papoura tombs, it was described as less decadent than the style of the Re-occupation period.20 Certain objects, however, such as the decorated stirrup jar from Tomb 68, and necklace 36k, placed certain tombs 'within the limit of the last period of the Palace at Knossos'.21 When the contents of the tombs were dated, Evans took into consideration their style but also the occurrence of similar objects in the Palace. Thus, it was noticed that the Zapher Papoura tombs lacked 'squat aryballoi' of the type imitating the alabaster versions of the Throne Room. Such vessels were found in 1 904 at a chamber tomb near the Royal Tomb at Isopata. Furthermore, 'the abundance of the stirrup-jar or pseudamphora type' was considered 'as a late characteristic'.22 Interestingly, the Zapher Papoura tombs lacked Palace Style jars and large numbers of stone vases, in contrast to the Palace and the Royal Tomb at Isopata. After 1904 and especially between 1905 and 1910, there are no changes in the excavators' views on the pottery classification as set forward in the 'Preliminary Classification' article. An enlarged version was printed in French for the Archaeological Congress of 1905, before excavation commenced on the LP; a revised version was finally published in 1906. At the start of the 1905 excavation season, the term LM II was applied for the 'Late Palace Phase' pottery and the term LM III for 'Re-occupation period' material. But was Mackenzie correct in his identification of the pottery phases associated with the 'Last Palace' and the succeeding 're-occupation' periods? It is beyond doubt that Palace Style jars co- existed with what nowadays is defined as LM II to LM IIIA2.23 The published photograph of LM IIIA sherds from the Royal Villa, which were assigned by Evans to 'the period of partial habitation', illustrates how the excavators had failed to recognise the relationship of LM IIIA small vessels to the Palace Style jars. The mistake was repeated in several Zapher Papoura tombs, the clay vessels from which stylistically fall within LM IIIA. This mistake, as noticed by Popham, was the result of placing too much emphasis on the Palace Style jars, especially since the repertoire of motifs applied on these large vessels was unsuitable for small open shapes.24 Besides, both Mackenzie and Evans had failed to recognise that plain kylikes and champagne cups could have been present in both the Late Palace and the Re-occupation periods.25 In conclusion, for the years 1905-10 when the terms 'LM IIP or 're-occupation' pottery are used in the notebooks and published reports, they may equally refer to what nowadays is identified as LM IIIA or LM IIIB pottery. Subsequently, all references made by Mackenzie or Evans to 'LM IIP and 'Re-occupation' pottery when not accompanied by illustrations or a more diagnostic description of the material in question cannot be treated as a reliable source for dating. THE NATURE AND DATE OF THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS Mackenzie never wrote an overall history of the LP, although he had identified distinct architectural phases. His firm views on stratigraphy and dating were much reflected in Evans's early reports. The existence of two architectural phases along the East Sector was recognised at a very early stage in the excavation, when the N boundary of Room 7 (Peristyle Hall) was reached and the blocked doorways became exposed (plan 5).26 Three days later, after the extensively remodelled Rooms 8-10 were fully revealed, the architectural modifications observed were assigned to 'the period of re-occupation'.27 By the time the blocked-up Corridor 1 8 was excavated, Mackenzie was convinced that the period of re-occupation had begun 'with the walling up of doorways' (plan 53). 28 He recognised that these alterations changed the layout of the rooms in question and degraded the rooms 'to common uses so characteristic of the period of re-occupation'. The fire destruction debris within the re-modelled rooms appeared to be homogenous as 'everything that came out in the course of removing the deposit went to confirm the general impression of a complete re-occupation of the house in the later period'.29 20 'The use of the word "Mycenaean" required radical revision, the Mycenaean culture being in its main features merely a late and subsidiary outgrowth of this great "Minoan" style, when the fine motives of the last Palace Period are already seen in a state of decadence ... The recently discovered cemetery at Knossos shows the less decadent forerunners of this style, though still later that those of the last Palace Period...' 21 Evans 19050, 131. 22 Evans 10050, 128. 23 The Palace Style jar, H 181, was part of the upper floor collapse that fell into the MUM Pillar Hall; two more similar vessels, M 76 and M 1 27, originally belonging to the upper floor were found in the upper fill of Room M; cf. MUM, pls. 68-70. In tombs, Palace Style jars were found in Katsamba Tombs A and Z, dated to LM II; and in Tomb Theta, dated to early LM IIIA2.

The original arrangement of the so-called Minoan Megaron and Peristyle Hall (Rooms 7-10) presented a unique sequence of rooms comparable only to rooms of the Domestic Quarter in the Palace (plates 1-2). Consequently, it is not surprising that Mackenzie dated these modifications, which had been interpreted as a sign for 'inferior' inhabitants, to the re-occupation period - a time when Minoan civilisation, according to the excavators, was in decline. The single reference to the date of the pottery uncovered was made after excavation had much progressed. It indicates the lack of rich pottery deposits in the excavated rooms and corroborates the suggestion that the date assigned was based mainly on the extensive architectural modifications. From the soil descriptions recorded, it becomes obvious that once the Minoan levels were reached Mackenzie identified a single destruction deposit throughout the re-modelled rooms. This observation explains why he visualised a complete re-occupation of the building, on both the ground and upper floors. Thus, during the excavation of Room 19 Mackenzie reported on the sealing deposits discovered so far that 'most if not all of the clay seals found originally belonged to rooms situated above the lower storey of the building'. The re-occupation date assigned to the LP destruction deposits was not based on a sequence of successive floor levels or the ceramic style of associated pottery. On the contrary, the radical alterations observed in the layout of different rooms were the single criterion for assigning a re-occupation date to the deposits. No sealings were directly associated with the re-occupation, verifying Mackenzie's unwillingness to accept such an advanced date for the LP deposits. In contrast to the sealings, the furnishings of Room 17 were immediately associated with a house shrine which Mackenzie compared to the Shrine of the Double Axes and the shrine in the S. E. House, both of which were securely dated to the re-occupation period.31 Evans's views on the stratigraphy and dates assigned to the newly excavated building were initially presented in the 1 905 BSA Report. Evans was in agreement with his assistant on the history of the newly discovered building, but was more daring than Mackenzie in explicitly arguing that the sealings and tablets dated to the re-occupation period. He accepted that the construction of the various architectural modifications did not post-date the fierce fire destruction since the woodwork 'was unconsumed'.32 Despite the 'abundant traces of later occupation during the more decadent period of Minoan civilisation and of the breaking up of seigniorial halls into the dwellings of humbler denizens' he was precise in stating that they had not found 'traces of such a cataclysmic break between the two periods of habitation as is visible in some parts of the Palace area'.33 Unlike most objects discovered in the area of Room 17, two sealings, apparently depicting religious scenes, were 'associated with an earlier shrine'.34 The bulk of the sealings, however, attested that 'there was no real break in continuity' of the material culture. Evans concluded that clay sealings, securing documents and possessions, were still used during this decadent period and that 'the fully developed linear script continued to be at least partially in use'.35 Evans had not only accepted Mackenzie's re-occupation date, but was also trying to identify 'late' characteristics in the style of the seals which had stamped the lumps of clay. Similar views were repeated in SM II, where Evans stated that 'on the later floors there were found heaps of more or less fragmentary seal-impressions' together with 'remains of tablets showing inscriptions belonging to Class B but executed in somewhat inferior manner'.36 Finally in the 1905 BSA report he placed the LP material in context: 'The kings are less, the people are more, and the princely building now partially explored, like the great Palace opposite and the 'Royal Villa' beyond, is broken up into smaller habitations. The Royal Tomb of Isopata itself became a common sepulchre.'37 The finds of 1908 differed from those of the previous excavation season in that no sealings or tablets came up, but pottery deposits, dated to the Last Palace period, were discovered. In many parts of the building, the earth fills seem to have been contaminated in antiquity. Mackenzie, obviously discouraged, reported that 'the deposits were everywhere very much disturbed and this disturbance seemed to be partly the work of the later inhabitants of the house partly the work of people in search 30 DM/DB 1 5-20.V.05, 77. 31 DM/DB, 6.V.05, 7S-4. 32 Evans 1004-^, 6. 33 Evans 1904-5, 5.

Hence, the E face of the Bridge connecting the LP to the MUM was 'cut away at a later time (LM III)' to set the shallow stone drain, which passes in between (plate 8 a).39 Again the terrace wall, which retains the NE Platform (NEP) and runs parallel to the LP West Facade, was dated to the re-occupation period because of its 'inferior' construction in comparison to the LP West Facade (plan 13). AE/NB adds a small detail, confirming the impression that walls were regularly dated according to their appearance and quality of construction. It further suggests that the two excavators were in disagreement over the interpretation of the material found: 'Note that the blocking wall of the re-occupants was not faced with gypsum plaques like the earlier walls. The characteristic posts at intervals not visible. M. Thinks blocking of jambs reflects a foreign people unaccustomed to Minoan usage - but late seals &amp; (&amp; ?tablets) show great continuity'.40 Regardless of many disturbances the sw part of the building revealed closed deposits, this time dated to the Palace period (fig. 4.32). As in 1905, Mackenzie refrained from expressing any opinion on the nature of the material excavated. No attempt was made to link stratigraphically or chronologically the deposits discovered along the SW Sector to those uncovered during the previous excavation season. The 1910 notebook adds little to the subject of dating, since no relevant references were made, probably because Mackenzie was for most of the time supervising other sites excavated simultaneously with the LP. Much of the Basement's e half had been robbed away in post-Minoan times, so Mackenzie did not expect to discover pure deposits. Four years later in the publication of the 1908 and 1910 seasons Evans, like his assistant, kept all references on dating very vague. This is especially true for comments relating, stratigraphically and chronologically, areas exposed during the different excavation campaigns. Evans in his brief summary on Room 17 repeated the re-occupation date assigned to the modifications and the cult objects found within, but avoided all references to the sealings and tablets. Only the lead female figurine was chronologically associated with 'the later occupants' of Room 1 7 who 'after a period of catastrophe parcelled out among themselves this once stately mansion' (plate 22 ¿z, fig. 5.2: 1; plan 13). It was only at a much later date that Evans started to revise his views on the date of the LP deposits. When Evans composed the PM chapter on the LP, he was relying entirely on the excavation records and previous publications. A radically modified interpretation of the material was presented: the building partially suffered from a destruction and various vessels, dated to the last LM II style, were scattered along the floors of the SW Sector. Then, 'palatial habitation was succeeded by a partial re- occupation of the same kind during the last Late Minoan phase', during which time the rooms along the East and North Sectors were blocked up.41 This part of the building was 'only partially destroyed and a large part of it had been simply deserted by its original lordly possessors to be tenanted in their palace by boorish squatters, after a short or longer interval which it may have remained derelict.'42 Evans altogether avoided the issue of the final fire destruction in which the sealings were preserved and did not even mention the extensive sealing deposits found. Nevertheless he disassociated the tablets from the 'squatters', noting that although 'the use of Linear Script B survived the overthrow of the Palace is probable, but the squatters who, at a later date, introduced their crude fetish worship into the "Little Palace" were surely analfabeti'.43 Finally, in the last PM volume, the date of the LP sealings was revised to 'the last Age of the Palace'. It was during this period that the building suffered 'the same final catastrophe' as the Palace.44 M DM/DB 22. iv.08, 77. 39 ZW/D£i7.vi.o8,82. 40 AE/NB 1908, 8. 41 PMII, 543. 42 PM 11, 544. 4:1 PMIL k4« n. 1. 44 PM IV, 599.</page><page sequence="40">Chapter 3 The architecture ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION INTRODUCTION The Little Palace (LP) lies about 230 m nw of the Palace and immediately E of the Minoan Unexplored Mansion (MUM), to which it was closely related, since the two were connected by a Bridge (plate 8 a). The LP, which came into commission earlier and was larger, is set on a n-s axis with its present remains extending for 43.03 m n-s by 27.46 m e-w. It was built on three different levels, the lowest being the Basement at roughly 3 m below the ground floor of the structure (plates 1-4).1 Similar to the MUM, large parts of the LP must have been set on bedrock, after most evidence for earlier buildings on site had been erased and the natural rock (kouskouras) had been cut back and levelled out. Evans dated the construction of the LP 'to the great Restoration after the Earthquake that overthrew the earlier MM III palace'.2 The N, w and e borders of the building are well defined, unlike the so-called E Front, where extensive post-Minoan occupation levels had removed all evidence for its extent in this direction (plans 17-19, plates 2-3). Equally unknown remain any details of the town planning in the immediate vicinity of the LP apart from the space to the w occupied by the MUM. CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION WORK IN THE LITTLE PALACE Parts of the site were restored both by Evans and Nikolaos Platon.3 The modern masonry can be easily distinguished, because the limestone blocks have even faces with sharp edges and carry signs of a clawed chisel, freely applied to the stone surface. Evans favoured grey-coloured cement, although consolidation with a crumbly mixture of pebbles and lime was also used. Pure lime has been traced in Room 17, where it was applied on a variety of surfaces, for bonding the gypsum dado, for consolidating the fluted column impressions and for sealing the tops of the original walls. Platon's work can be distinguished by the pinkish-tinted cement used. But even though restoration work has hidden various architectural features, on the whole the original masonry was less affected and obstructed than in other buildings at Knossos. Evans's primary concern was to protect Room 1 7 because of the fluted column impressions (plate 6). A temporary 1905 wooden roof was replaced by the solid construction set up in 1910, which covered not only Room 17, but also Rooms 18 and 14 (plate 1 a-b). The se and ne corners of Rooms 12 and 18, together with the sw and nw corner of Room 17, were removed and replaced by four pillars of smoothly faced modern limestone blocks. All walls, apart from the rubble and mud-plaster partition along the E balustrade, were restored up to ceiling height. The e balustrade and partition wall were reinforced by a rubble wall built up against their E side, overlooking Corridor 18. A roof of clay tiles, equipped with three windows for light, was positioned above the restored Minoan walls, and a drainage system was provided, which ran through Room 9. In 1922, a terrace wall in rubble masonry was constructed along the so-called E Front and the Basement's n terrace wall (plate 2 b). 1931 was the year when Evans rescued the building 'from an advancing stage of decomposition' by initiating extensive restoration and consolidation work.4 His primary concern was to restore Staircase 32 and consolidate the floors in Rooms 6b, 7 and 8-10. Piet de Jong was probably responsible for the 1 PM II, 526 fig. 328 and Evans 1914, 65 fig. 79. L FM 11, 514. * Ihis study has been based on the visible architectural remains, Doll's pencil and inked plans and the invaluable photographs from the Evans archive, which have been the main source for distinguishing the original Minoan construction and assessing the state of the walls when the building was excavated. Silt and rain wash have been deposited in the last decades on the LP floors and exterior areas, as a result of which various architectural features have become obstructed. However, because of the building's great size, no attempt was made to clean the floors systematically. 1 PM IV, 2 1 6, 2 1 7 fig. 1 66 and supplementary pl. L. 29</page><page sequence="41">3o THE ARCHITECTURE restoration of Staircase 32, although the pottery collected from here (P. I. 15) and the Basement (P. I. 17), was the work of Pendlebury. As in other buildings in Knossos, ferro-concrete and iron girders were used extensively for these repairs.5 Along the E Sector, doorjambs and pavements were consolidated, though there is no information as to whether decayed gypsum pavement slabs were replaced by others, as is known to have occurred at the time elsewhere around the site. The N and E borders of Rooms 8-10 were reconstructed and the gypsum dados were positioned along the n wall of Room g.6 The walls of Staircase 32, which at the time seem to have stood in a bad state of repair, were replaced with rubble and concrete and the original gypsum steps and pier blocks restored to their original position. Both Staircase 4 and the stepped doorway in Corridor 6a were restored in cement, which was painted ochre and terracotta, and reinforced by iron girders. Finally the rubble walls were extensively reinforced by concrete. Platon conducted a second series of repairs in November and December of 1956.7 Substantial alterations were made to the area of Room 17, where the roofing system was replaced (plate 14 c). A metal and wood frame covered by a plastic roof, replaced the old tile roof, but only above Rooms 1 7 and 18. A similar roof was added to the Staircase 32, where Platon added more rubble masonry above Evans's.8 In Room 17, the n balustrade was extensively consolidated with cement, especially along its s face. Throughout the Basement and within Room 3, a layer of pebbles was set over the floor, which was afterwards covered by cement. Much restoration took place along the SW Sector, where the N wall of Room 37 was restored, the blocked doorway between Corridor 33 and the SE Court was opened and the masonry along the wall immediately to the w were put into position.9 By 1956, when Platon constructed the cement approach from the modern roadway to the se, the E Front had been already backfilled.10 Finally the two post-Minoan wells in Rooms 34 and 37 were excavated. The dry-stone walling built to support the earth baulks to the s of the site and the roof above Rooms 8-9 are more recent operations, conducted under the direction of Stylianos Alexiou. Finally an extensive conservation programme, directed by Alexandra Karetsou under the auspices of the 23rd Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, took place in May-June 1995. The results of this project are presented in the Appendix. THE EXTERIOR OF THE BUILDING With the exception of the E Facade, where all evidence for its position and layout was removed by later occupants, the exterior walls are certain and survive in places to an impressive height. On the N face of the building the projecting line of Room 1 1 divides the wall into three sections, of which the two recessed parts had their first courses faced with gypsum blocks (plans 26-7). Only a narrow space outside the Facade has been excavated, enough to reveal the stone drain which runs through it (plan 13 and plate 5 a). The N Drain starts at the N end of the Paved Passage, continues through the NW Court and then follows a course roughly parallel to the N Facade. Proceeding further s, the Paved Passage stretches between the W Facade and the NE Platform (NEP), before it terminates in front of the N Storage Room Facade. The North Facade The E stretch of the N Facade and its Drain were removed by the extensive post-Minoan robbing activity along the E Front. Sections of the foundation course were traced for 6 m, parts of the Facade were restored by Evans in cement, and even the limestone foundation blocks, which have been incorporated in the reconstruction, may not lie in situ (plates 1, 2 ¿, 3, plan 7). The remaining part of the Facade was much better preserved. The position of the E wall, which projects for 70 cm, is set on a low foundation course of rubble, with two courses of its ashlar masonry above in situ. Then the Facade turns w for 5.45 m. The e half of this projecting section is set on a foundation course of small limestone blocks, which ran on a nne-ssw line (plan 26). The remaining w part rests on a similar foundation course, though it was set on an E-w line, and ran at a higher level than the 5 PMUL 288. 6 Compare plates 2 b and 3 a-b to plate 1 a. 7 Platon 1OF.6. /too. 8 ComDare plate 1 ato iiu. ■' The last three restorations have been confirmed through a set of photographs, taken by N.

E half. This difference in alignment and level might indicate that the E half of the foundation course is part of an earlier structure, the sparse remains of which were amalgamated into the present Facade. For almost the entire length of the wall, small stones were set between the foundation and the first course to create a level surface for the ashlar blocks which followed. The three surviving courses of the Facade are 34, 44 and 34 cm thick. Great care was taken to maintain these relative heights of the individual courses. Thus small stones were set occasionally between the second and third courses, in order to eliminate a potential gap of 5 cm, where a somewhat smaller block had been used. Further to the w and again between the second and third courses, a gap of 2 cm, created by a slightly smaller block, was filled in with earth and gravel. Two ashlar blocks, located at the w end of the wall, are clearly in secondary use, since both were hewn to fit in the construction and one has a dowel hole on its top. The careless construction of the Facade's w end suggests that it might be a re-build. At this point the Facade continues s for 3.68 m, and then continues w for 5. 10 m until the building's NW corner is reached (plate 12 ß). The Facade section running N-s was set on a foundation course, projecting for 8 cm, built out of large limestone blocks, except for the corner stone, which is of gypsum. Of the ashlar wall above this foundation only two limestone blocks of the first course and a single block of the second stand in situ. The blocks measure 36-38 and 36 cm high respectively. The remaining part of the building's N Facade is probably the most elegant exterior wall of the LP (plan 27). For the entire length of the wall, the first two courses above the projecting limestone foundation are of gypsum orthostates. The ashlar wall then continued up in limestone blocks, of which two more courses are in situ. The courses have a thickness of 40, 60, 35, and 37 cm, measuring from the bottom to the top. The corner block now visible above all this, was not found there but was restored to this position (plans 27-8, plate 10 a).n A 1.24 m wide gap near the wall's E corner was correctly identified by the excavators as a window.12 At this point, the gypsum orthostate was made shorter, only 0.36 m high, to fit below the window and to harmonise with the first course of the Facade running n-s immediately the e. Another peculiarity is observed with the foundation course, which in front of the window projects for 1 1 cm, instead of 8 cm as in all other parts of the wall. There are no traces of dowel holes cut on the gypsum orthostate, but the slightly curving w corner, recalls the similar arrangement in the MUM ground floor window.13 The gypsum facade bares no fire marks save for small sections on either side of its section that fitted the window. Here the grey coloured gypsum has turned white. After the nw corner, the W Facade runs down to the point where it meets the exterior wall of Room 28, a stretch named the N Storage Room Facade. Here 3 m w of the LP lies the NEP, the walls of which are on the same orientation as the LP. The space in between, named the Paved Passage, was set on two levels: the difference being accommodated by a single step going up/down (plan 29). The West Facade Although the W Facade is the longest and highest preserved exterior wall, its state of preservation is more impressive than the quality of its masonry, which in some parts is inferior compared to other LP exterior walls (plan 28, plates 12 ¿, 11, 10 a-b). This 13.90 m long wall was constructed out of smoothly faced limestone blocks, some of which are obviously in secondary use. The ashlar blocks have much decayed since they were unearthed, especially from sudden changes in temperature, which have caused cracking. The wall, which bears no burning marks, is set on a projecting foundation course of limestone blocks, which follow the level of the Paved Passage by stepping up 20 cm at 7.90 m s of the Facade's N end. Near the s end, at 10.28 m, there is a vertical setback of 12 cm along the wall, which includes the limestone foundation. At the nw corner and along the Facade's n end the ashlar courses continue the heights they have in the N Facade that is 46, 58, 36, 39 cm starting from the bottom. Further s the Facade continues in regular courses of 41, 36, 39, 31, 31, 36, 36, and 37 cm. The two patterns are interrupted by a short interval, where the limestone blocks were set irregularly in order to bridge the differences in heights. 11 The corner block positioned over the Facade's fifth course did not originally belong here, since it is only i 7 cm high, whereas the preserved blocks at the same level further s along the W Facade are 40 cm high. In plate 10 0, the building's sw corner is visible before the limestone block was positioned on the fifth course. The two dowel holes, on top of the corner block along the fourth course are clearly visible. 12 DM/DB 17.vi.08, 82. 13 MUM, 108. Unless caused by weathering.</page><page sequence="43">32 THE ARCHITECTURE At this part of the wall, a variety of filling materials were used such as pebbles, clay earth, sherds, flakes of green schist, to fill the gaps occurring between the limestone blocks. In some parts the white plaster, applied to close and cover these intervals between the limestone blocks, is still preserved. The Minoan masons preferred, however, to place the limestone blocks in regular courses throughout the length of a wall. The section of the Facade s of the vertical set back is the most successfully constructed part (3.65 m long). Here the limestone blocks were positioned in courses of 36, 36, 34- 36, 34, and 31, 32 cm, measured from the bottom. There is a gap of 14 cm between the second and third course for a wooden beam (plan 28). Evans filled in the gap with cement in order to support the courses above which tilt slightly outwards. This anomaly in the upper courses was probably created at a time when the horizontal wooden beam below had deteriorated. More than one wooden beam could have been used to fill the gap left in the Facade, since the beam slot is 5.40 m long, extending beyond the vertical set back of the Facade. Along the s end of the cement beam there is a vertical tool cutting along the ashlar block of the second course. It could be interpreted as a tool mark made by Evans's masons during the construction of the cement beam. This s end of the Facade is the most complete and original part. The section of the Facade, that remains beyond the northern limit of the beam slot becomes again irregular and is composed from blocks of miscellaneous sizes and shapes, such as flat blocks of gypsum and square ones of limestone. A variety of noteworthy features exist along this section. At 5.20 m from the N end of the Facade in the first course and before the paved floor of the Paved Passage rises, two limestone blocks were set back into the wall (plan 28, plate 10 b). None of the surrounding limestone blocks, including the foundation course below, aligns with these two recessed blocks. Since the possibility of a mistake during the initial construction of the wall seems unlikely, these vertical setbacks could well have accommodated a window arrangement on the first floor. Such an interpretation would imply that in its present form this section of the W Facade is a re-build down to its second course. In addition, the first course limestone ashlar block, which forms the N border of the vertical setback, has a single reveal to fit the setback. Near the N end of the W Facade and also in the first course are two gaps in the ashlar masonry, which have been filled in with rubble (plan 28).14 Evidence concerning the purpose of at least the second is provided by the limestone foundation course. Along the upper surface, the relevant block has a rectangular cutting carved on its surface, measuring 13.5 x 8 x 5.5 cm. It should be added that 1.10 m to the N begins the N Drain (plate 12 a). The second gap is probably a blocked drain linked with Room 14, which stretches behind this section of the Facade, and the N Drain, which commences nearby. These features escaped Mackenzie's and Doll's attention, since neither marked them on any of their plans. The blocking up of the drain was probably related to some structural problem in the N Drain or more likely to some change in the use of Room 14. The poor quality of the construction of the W Facade suggests that damage on a number of occasions led to extensive repairs rather than that inferior building standards were employed from the beginning. Plan 28 shows the sections of the Facade, which most probably belong to its initial construction. The North Storage Room Facade In contrast, here, the quality of construction and mason's work impressed both Mackenzie and Evans, who regularly commented on various features of this exterior wall, which runs E-w for 6.36 m (plan 29, plates 11,12 Ã).15 The wall's foundation course is not visible: its e half is covered by limestone paving, whereas the w is obscured by silt. The first and second courses stand fairly complete, with only one block of the third in situ. The blocks were set in courses of 52, 57 and 49 cm, starting from bottom. A vertical setback of 5.5 cm is created 3.73 m E of the wall's w end. It was related to the construction of the first course further e, since the recessed part was made of gypsum orthostates. Their surface carries no traces of burning. All other preserved sections of the Facade are of limestone blocks. For the second course the vertical setback was cut into the face of a larger, single massive block, starting 29 cm from its E end. All the limestone blocks positioned immediately above the gypsum orthostate project by 5 cm. Unless this discrepancy has been created through the erosion of the gypsum, it must be regarded as a deliberate feature to protect the vulnerable gypsum orthostate below. For the third course, the vertical setback was formed by two blocks, which were set back 11 The first is located immediately after the nw corner gypsum block, at 90 cm to the s. The second is positioned 1.60 m further s, between the second and third ashlar block in its course. The former measures 45 x 30 cm, and the latter 26 x 24 cm. 15 DM/DB 18.iv.08, 73 and Evans 1914, 74 fig. 85.</page><page sequence="44">THE ARCHITECTURE 33 again in line with the first course. The w half of the Facade included some of the finest examples of Minoan masonry found in the LP. The grey, hard and finely dressed limestone blocks have been fitted perfectly next to each other. The excavators interpreted both the gypsum orthostate and the vertical setback as evidence for the position of a window at the E end of the wall.16 In plate h û,a narrow limestone slab set above the preserved orthostate and limestone blocks was identified by Evans as a window sill. This block is no longer in situ. The North East Platform (NEP) The w boundaries of the Paved Passage are defined by the NEP, which lies 2.80-3.00 m w of the LP (plans 13, 46, plates 8 fl, lo-i i). The NEP covered and protected from erosion a trimmed section of the natural rock.17 Although Mackenzie identified it as 'a rough terrace wall with soft clayey rock behind', he was intrigued by the difference in construction between it and the W Facade. 'The whole at once made the impression of an inferior arrangement set up by squatters on the spot after the house had fallen into ruins'.18 The terrace walls of the platform run N-s and E-w and align with the axes of the LP exterior walls, which may be a good argument for their contemporaneity. They were built mostly out of massive, roughly cut limestone blocks, consolidated with rubble, though ashlar and gypsum blocks of various shapes, including several damaged pier blocks, were used as well. None bears traces of fire. The wall extends w for 6.30 m, although its original length remains unknown, since it was cut off when the MUM E Facade was constructed.19 The terrace wall runs for 14 m to the N and disappears into the N baulk of the site. Its highest preserved point lies in its sw corner. A terminus ad quern for the foundation of this wall is LM IIIAi, according to the pottery collected from its rubble make-up (fig. 3.3: 8-10). The Paved Passage A narrow passage was created between the LP and the NEP, paved with hard grey limestone blocks or slabs, some of which are in secondary use, such as one block with a square dowel hole carved on its surface (plates 10, 1 1, 12 b). S of the NEP the paved area is slightly wider at 3.40 m E-w, ending to the w in a straight line. The paving begins in front of the LP N Storage Room Facade and extends n for about 1 o m, where it gradually disappears as the pavement slabs are less well preserved. There is a gentle slope in the floor level, from s down to N, which was undoubtedly intentional, to facilitate the flow of rainwater. This is best observed at the s end of LP W Facade. The pavement starts at the same level as the projecting foundation course, but further s it continues at a slightly lower level, so that more of the Facade's foundation course becomes visible. This gentle decrease in the floor level was accentuated by a single step going down at 6.20 m N. Beyond this point the paving continues with smaller and more irregular paving slabs. Some slabs, although visible in plate 11, are today replaced by cement. The lack of stone paving after a certain point to the n is not necessarily the result of stone robbing, since 1 .40 m further N starts the N Drain. Great care was given not only to the disposal of rainwater but also to the protection of the building's walls. This is best demonstrated in front of the N Storage Room Facade along the section lined with gypsum orthostates (plan 29). Here, the foundation course of the Facade is not visible since it is covered by the limestone paving. Thus the gypsum is not exposed to water collecting on the paving slabs. Between the gypsum uprights and the paving slabs, for 2.60 m, narrow limestone blocks were set on edge (up to 12 cm high) in order to protect the vulnerable gypsum from ground water. Furthermore, a gap between these blocks and the orthostate may have been covered with hydraulic cement, although no such traces were reported. This feature was noticed also by Mackenzie, who came to the same conclusion regarding its purpose.20 Another point to be raised is the relationship between the step in the pavement and the construction of the LP itself. Throughout its length the pavement abuts both the NEP and the W Facade; the projecting foundation course of the latter follows exactly the course of the descending pavement. This indicates that the position of the step and its height were known and taken into account when the foundation course was laid, a good argument for their contemporaneity. 16 DM/DB 1.V.08, 74 and pl. a8. 17 Marked on plan 46.

A 'rough rubble wall' was built up against the N Storage Room Facade and the s wall of the NEP (plan i i, plates 8 a, 10 a). Since this wall was built up against the LP exterior wall, it was taken as 'a later construction blocking up the passage E &amp; W'.21 Like many other modifications, this wall, which was standing to roughly the same height as the NEP walls, was demolished in 1908 or 1910, before Doll studied the architecture. However, in the position where this wall would have stood today, lie two limestone blocks which abut the N Storage Room Facade (plan 29). These blocks are positioned immediately beside and at a slightly lower level than the grey limestone paving slabs. They could be the scanty remains of the 'rough rubble wall', which Doll missed and marked as a foundation (plans 17-18). A second modification was discovered further to the N, where a wall running e-w, at 5 m s of the building's NW corner, blocked the paved passage (plates 8o,ioû). The wall, which was found preserved up to a considerable height, continued above the walls of the NEP further to the w. Its two upper courses were built out of re-used ashlar blocks, whereas the ones below seem to have been made out of rough limestone blocks and rubble. In plate 10 ¿z, it is not possible to distinguish if the wall went down to the level of the pavement or whether it rested on earth and started at a higher level. The wall was not reported by Mackenzie and was pulled down, soon after it was discovered.22 Remains of its upper courses, in the form of large roughly-cut limestone blocks with rubble set in between, are still in situ along the NEP (Compare plates 10 ¿z, 1 1, 12 b and plan 46). The wall was consolidated in 1995 and LM IIIAi sherds were collected from its make-up. The lack of more detailed information on this wall is regretted, especially in relationship to the one which blocked the s end of the Passage. Popham has suggested that this wall might have been related to steps ascending from the Paved Passage up to the MUM N Platform.23 This proposal, although attractive, remains hypothetical since no such remains were reported along the Paved Passage. The two rubble walls, which blocked the Paved Passage, could have also served as buttresses to a deteriorating and unstable W Facade and N Storage Room Facade. The North Drain The drain stretches for the entire length of the preserved section of the N Facade. Its e end shared the same fate as the borders of the building along the E Front, being cut away by later occupation levels (plan 50). Its starting point lies near the nw corner of the LP, 1.10 m nw of the blocked drain set in the first course of the W Facade. For its first 2.5 m it runs on a ssw-nne line, passing through the NW Court and turning twice slightly to the nne, until it aligns with the projecting N Facade of the LP (plate 12 a). The level of the drain decreases gradually from w to E. The well-like construction at the E end of the Drain is a modern feature added after the E Front was backfilled. Much of the drain is obscured by earth, stones and sherds, which have collapsed from the site's n section. Even though for most parts only the top courses are visible, it is possible to distinguish in places at least two courses of limestone blocks. The drain consists of two rows of small ashlar blocks set parallel to each other, 0.35-0.45 m apart. At 1.53 m from its starting point the drain meets up with a small side branch, which commences at the drain hole in Room 11. During the 1995 23rd Ephoreia restoration the N Drain was cleaned and its limestone slabbed floor became revealed. The visible remains of the Drain, which runs at a higher level than the floor of the Paved Passage, might belong to a reworking, when a second course was added. This re-facing probably took place after the drain along the W Facade was blocked, since the walls of the N Drain rise to a higher level. At the time when the Paved Passage became an enclosed space, a large section of the Drain would have gone out of use; the amount of rainwater channelled through would have decreased. The North West Court Before the N Drain lines up alongside the N Facade, it crosses the NW Court, a square and spacious open area immediately beyond the nw corner (plate 12 a). The s, E and w borders of this court are well defined by the ashlar facades of the LP and the NEP. The N boundary is hidden under the earth section, which here rises for about 5.50-6 m. A noteworthy feature is the rather odd-shaped single course wall, which was cut by the N Drain on its w side. The wall runs e-w and is constructed out of limestone blocks very similar in size to those used for the drain. Their smooth sides were carefully set to form two faces; the middle space filled 21 DM/DB 18.iv.08, 74 and fig. 15. 22 The wall was missed by Palmer and Boardman, but identified in MUM, 103 n. 11 and pl. 16 b, 19 c. 23 MUM, 103-4.</page><page sequence="46">THE ARCHITECTURE 35 in with rubble. Its w end, 62 cm thick, was destroyed by the drain. From this point it extends to the E for 2.10 m, gradually reaching a maximum thickness of 90 cm; it ends abruptly 0.65 m before the LP N Facade, though according to Doll's plan the same wall ran up to the Facade (plans 17-18). The s face of this wall is set parallel to the N Facade foundation course and does not seem to be related to the drain, even though it is constructed in a similar manner. Its s face could be interpreted as the remains of an earlier building on site, one that was completely demolished when the LP and the NW Court were laid out. Continuing further s the LP exterior wall, called here the W Storage Rooms Facade, stretches for 8.50 m N-s, covering the entire length of the storage rooms. Immediately to the w opens Space R, the least well understood space in the area between the LP and MUM. The West Storage Rooms Facade The projecting foundation course of limestone blocks is visible only for 3.20 m, at its s end, whilst the rest is covered by silt. Much of the wall's ashlar masonry was robbed in antiquity leaving only the N and s ends in a relatively good condition, in that the limestone blocks of the first course remain in situ (plate 8 a). The middle section, forming the w wall of Room 29, is preserved only in its foundation course, which is 1.40 m wide. The three limestone blocks, which have been placed in the position of the first course in this middle section, together with various blocks placed near the n end of the wall and a single block set up as part of the second course near the Facade's s end, are all reconstructions and thus inaccurate. Beyond this point the Facade continues E-w for a mere 86 cm before it turns again s (plate 12 c). The limestone blocks are set in courses of 28, 31 and 45 cm starting from the bottom. No doubt all were chosen to align with the courses of the previously discussed section of exterior wall, running N- s. This is demonstrated by the fact that the first two blocks together reach a height of 68 cm and align perfectly with the first course of the Facade running n-s. Special care was taken in bonding together the ashlar blocks of both walls, even though the foundation course below was set in a more careless manner. At the position where the foundation course of the Storage Room's W Facade, which ought to have ended and bonded to the wall running E-w, there is a 25 cm gap in the course of the limestone foundation, which was recorded on Doll's plan (plan 17). Then the foundation course continues on an E-w line. Although at first sight this small gap in the limestone foundation might recall a drain outlet, its position next to the upper flight of Staircase 34 makes such an identification highly improbable and impractical. The horizontal set back between it and the first course would have been deeper if the block of the first course was not set on a slightly nne-ssw angle (plate 12 c). The same angle was maintained for the block of the second and third course. The first two blocks were selected to reach the height of the first course of the W Storage Room Facade. The block used in the first course is in secondary use, since it has had a vertical set back cut near its E end, which was not followed on the blocks set above. The limestone blocks of both walls were hewn and chipped at their points of juncture in order to improve the fit. Space R24 Between the LP and MUM, extending s of the NEP and N of the MUM Buttress, opened Space R (plan 2). This is the least well-defined area between the two buildings. The original arrangement probably suffered the same fate as the poorly preserved sections of the LP W Storage Room Facade. Although the original arrangement is difficult to reconstruct, there is no doubt that rain water collected here and was channelled through the shallow drain-like slabs, set immediately s between the Buttress and LP projecting wall, down to the S Court. Moreover, the liquids from the MUM drain would have run through Space R.25 Finally the last section of the building's Facade, named here the SW Facade, will be presented. Here in the space between the two buildings a small paved court was carefully set up. Beyond the sw corner stretches the s Facade, one of the most impressive of the outer walls with massive gypsum orthostates and ashlar blocks (plan 31, plate 4 a). 24 Space R is discussed in MUM, 101-2. 2&gt; MUM, 102 and 110.</page><page sequence="47">36 THE ARCHITECTURE The South West Facade The LP exterior wall runs for 1 2.04 m down to the building's sw corner (plan 30). At 4.40 m from the N end is a vertical set back of 14 cm depth, which in relation to the room arrangement on the Facade's inner face follows the line of the s wall of Staircase 34 (plate 15c). The Facade's foundation course, as well as the first two courses of its ashlar wall, is obstructed in places both by the paving of the S Court and from the supporting wall for the Bridge, set near to the Facade's N end. The wall was built all in ashlar blocks, apart from 2.70 m of its first course just n of the building's sw corner. Here it was substituted by a gypsum orthostate, partly visible within the inner face of the wall, that is in Room 36, the SW Pillar Room (plate 15 d). Only four blocks of the third course remain in situ, two of which have square dowel holes, placed 1 .45 m apart and positioned to receive the sill for a window. This window would have overlooked the S Court from the first landing of Staircase 34. The Facade's n end is obstructed by a projecting wall, which aligns with the MUM buttresses (plan 30). This wall stretches today for 1.45 m but its original length remains undefined. It is built with well-faced limestone blocks, surviving up to three courses high. The wall's smooth face looks w, whereas the E side was probably filled in with rubble and roughly cut limestone blocks. Its purpose was to minimise the distance between the LP and MUM in order to set up the Bridge, which connected the two. Abutting the s face of this projecting wall and built up against the LP Facade, is a low two course high wall, set above the paving slabs of the court. The bottom course is 40 cm wide, the upper only 35 cm because of the horizontal set back between the two. Popham interprets it as a superficial re- facing of the LP Facade intended to harmonise with the horizontal setbacks of the MUM.26 Alternatively, it could have been added to protect the Facade from dampness especially when rainwater passed through the S Court. This wall was consolidated during the 1995 restoration; the latest sherds collected from its make-up date to LM II (fig. 3.3: 1-7). The South Court: Court of the Olive Press27 The space between the LP and MUM is covered by this small court measuring 4.3 x 5.5 m. Evans named it 'the Court of the Olive Press' after the large square limestone block set near the court's sw corner, which later he reinterpreted as an altar.28 The court is paved with grey limestone slabs, with small stones and pebbles set between them.29 The borders of this small court are well defined. To the w rises the E Facade wall of the MUM; to the n the MUM Buttress and the corresponding projecting wall built against the LP SW Facade. To the E rises the LP itself, with its low wall set upon the pavement slabs. Immediately to the s stretches the retaining wall of the S Platform, which leaves a narrow 70-75 cm passage between it and the LP, running further to the s. The low wall, built against the LP Facade, extends down to this narrow passage similarly to the paving, which disappears under silt just before the LP sw corner. The paving runs up to all the surrounding walls, apart from the low projecting one along the LP Facade, which was obviously set after the floor of the court was paved. The court's floor slopes: its highest point is to the N, its lowest near its s end.30 The change in level becomes more obvious in the narrow passage between the LP and the S Platform, the lowest point of which was measured next to the sw corner. Doll recorded on his pencil plan a section of a drain and slabs, next to the sw corner (plan 17). This S Drain today is completely covered by earth, which has fallen from the s baulks of the site. The excavators did not mention the drain, so it remains unclear whether it was traced further to the s. No doubt it facilitated the disposal of rainwater, which had collected in the S Court from further N. The court was paved after the MUM E Facade and the projecting wall w of the LP were built. The shallow drain-like slabs set along the Bridge were positioned after the paving was finished, since the last slab rests on the S Court paving. The low stepped wall, which was built up against the LP Facade, was also a later addition. The exact height of the wall remains unknown but it probably could not have exceeded more than three courses since the wall is quite narrow. Apart from matching the horizontal setbacks along the MUM Facade, the wall probably had a more practical purpose 2fi MUM, 100. 27 See also MUM 1084, 100-1. 28 PM 11, 542. 29 MUM, plan 1. 30 There is a 30 cm difference in height between the two points.</page><page sequence="48">THE ARCHITECTURE 37 in protecting the LP wall from damp, especially since the Facade near its s end had gypsum orthostates in the first course. Evans briefly reported the discovery of a 'hearth in corner' within the S Court.31 The existence of this hearth suggests that the court's use had changed with time, having ceased to function as an outlet for rainwater. However, not enough evidence exists to indicate whether the space was also roofed at the time. The South Facade Apart from minimum restoration work, mainly that of consolidating the rubble filling and packing of the inner face, the wall stands as the excavators unearthed it, but unfortunately much deteriorated since 1908 (plates 4 a, 13 a, plan 31).32 The projecting limestone foundation course, on which the Facade is set, survives for the total length of the wall, although most of it lies under silted earth. Six gypsum blocks, covering about two thirds of the wall's total length, is all that survives today of the gypsum orthostate system, which formed the first course of the Facade. The most striking feature of the S Facade, apart from the size of its ashlar blocks is the strong burning marks preserved throughout the gypsum blocks, which form the Facade's first course. All gypsum blocks are of the thick grain variety, which in places are badly weathered and discoloured black or white by the action of fire. Unlike the two eastern blocks, which were set directly on the projecting krepidoma, the third and fourth orthostate blocks sit on a 8 cm thick course of small rough stones, which presumably lay above the foundation blocks. This layer could not be traced any further to the w since it was covered by silt. One of the gypsum blocks was repaired, since its NW corner was replaced by a rectangular poros limestone block (plan 31). The following courses, judging from the two surviving blocks of the second and the remaining one of the third course, were constructed out of large well-dressed limestone blocks. No architectural feature is visible in the 3.30 m wide area between the S Facade and the earth baulk, which is protected by a drystone walling. The S Drain, traces of which were uncovered at the sw corner, probably once passed in front of the Facade. The East Facade Almost all evidence for this wall was removed or eroded in antiquity, apart from the limestone foundation course that survives intact. A gypsum orthostate formed the first course, of which part of the NW corner block lies today just inside Room 37 (plates 4 a, 7 ¿, 9 a). This decayed block was moved within the room during restoration work; in plate 7 ¿, it is visible in its original position. The action of fire has turned its surface white, proof that the East Facade had a similar fate to the extensively burned S Facade. The much-deteriorated condition of the gypsum, visible even in the photographs, suggests that this end of the wall was exposed to weathering for some time after the building had fallen into ruins. The Early Facade The Early Facade is constituted by the 3.70 m long wall with gypsum orthostates for its first course, which starts immediately E of the LP Entrance (plates 2 ¿, 4 0, 7 a-b, 9 a). The quality of construction is comparable to the orthostate along the S Facade, although here the gypsum blocks are 10-15 cm shorter. A unique feature is the two course high limestone foundation, on which the orthostate was set. The stepped foundation course, which no doubt was built to be visible, was completely hidden when the space in front was occupied by the Causeway. The rubble masonry above the gypsum blocks belongs to the Main Staircase. From the evidence of the original masonry, there is no indication as to whether the wall continued in ashlar or in some other manner of construction. Here too, the traces of fire extend along the entire length of the Early Facade, as the upper half of the gypsum course is discoloured white. At the w end of the Facade, the burning is visible on its w and n face. The South East Court A small court was created between the E Facade, the Early Facade and the w wall of the Basement's upper floor (plates 2 ¿, 4 ¿z, 7 ¿, 9 a). This SE Court was crossed on a nnw-sse line, by a narrow paved 31 AE/NB 1908, 9. 32 DM/DB 17.vi.08, 81.</page><page sequence="49">38 THE ARCHITECTURE path, constructed of grey limestone blocks. The floor level, on which the so-called Causeway was set, completely covered the stepped foundation blocks of the Early Facade. During modern restoration work the Causeway was moved further to the nw, its original position is clearly visible on plate 7 a. The court was paved with large slabs of grey limestone, which surround the Causeway and follow the line of the E Facade, leaving a 5 cm gap. W of the SE Court opens the ground floor of the Basement. In antiquity this court must have been quite sheltered from the E by the rising w wall of the Basement. Near the nw corner of the court lies a worked ashlar block, presumably used for grinding, judging from the circular depression on its top surface; it measures 26 x 15 x 14 cm (plan 17, plate 7 b). On Doll's plans two walls are recorded as surviving only as foundation courses. The first running N-s was located N of Room 37, the second was set on a w-E axis and started immediately E of the S Facade (plan 17, plate 13 a). The former is no longer visible, since covered by cement, whereas the latter, built in rough limestone blocks, is set 15 cm lower than the E Facade's foundation course. Both walls are probably foundations to a pre-LP structure. The East Front The region E of the Minoan Megaron, Peristyle Hall and Basement, named the E Front, lies today covered by substantial amounts of backfill (plate 2 a-b). Significant post-Minoan occupation levels were excavated in this area, which had removed all traceable remains of the e borders of the Minoan building (plate 2 a-b). Mackenzie briefly commented on the ancient remains found here, in relation to the damage inflicted on the LP and its E borders and the systematic re-use of Minoan masonry.33 Evans gave a brief description in his notebook on some of the finds along the E Front: 'the space E. of stylobate of 'Megaron' occupied by quite late buildings - ? ... Roman pottery from here'.34 Furthermore traces of a Hellenistic Shrine, including votive terracottas and a limestone relief of a riding youth, were reported in The Times?0 These references to good post-Minoan levels coincide with the cluster of later walls indicated on Doll's pencil plan (plan 17). The different alignment and heights given on the plan might indicate more than one architectural and archaeological phases in the area. There is no reason to doubt that all walls drawn in this region are post-Minoan, especially since they do not align with any LP walls.36 The post-Minoan levels extended also down to the region of the Basement, especially along its e half, such as Mackenzie reported on the 'mass of later walls' set above the Minoan remains.37 THE ROADWAY E of these later walls parts of a paved roadway were traced, running on a sse-nnw line and ascending s (plans 17-19). Mackenzie considered it to be Minoan, since at the end of the 1908 excavation season, work started in the area of the Basement in hope of exploring 'the relationship of the house to the roadway which we knew to pass in front of it at a lower level'.38 Doll obviously had a different opinion, since in Evans 1914 it was referred to as a 'Later Roadway'. In one of his 1910 reports to The Times Evans referred to traces of wheel-ruts in the paving slabs of the roadway.39 Moreover, from Doll's pencil plan it is clear that one of the 'post-Minoan' walls set immediately w of the road aligns with the course of the roadway: a likely sign of contemporaneity perhaps? Evans seems to have often changed his mind on the road's date since in PM it has been labelled both as Minoan or Roman. The Minoan date was frequently chosen for site plans: the LP ground- floor plan, where the road was referred to as 'the Early Paved Way',40 in P. de Jong's isometric reconstruction41 and on plans of the Knossos region, where it was regularly considered to be part of 'the old Minoan road' running on a sse-nnw line.42 Other Minoan roads at Knossos, such as the Royal Road, consist of slabs set in pairs and have a width of 1.20 m. According to Doll's plan, the road in question, although about 1.20 m wide, consists of a single row of slabs. In addition, the traces of wheel ruts in the paving slabs and the alignment of 33 DM/DB 20.iv.10, 6. 34 AE/NB 1Q08, 8. 35 The Times, Sept. 16 1910, 4; iWII, 517 n. 1; see also Hood and Smvth 1081. 48. 36 Parts of these walls are barely visible in plates 2 a and 3 a.

ACCESS TO THE BUILDING It is not surprising that Mackenzie's closing comment on the LP excavation concerned the lack of an entrance to the building.43 Evans envisaged the main entrance to the building to have been in the lost area of the E Front (plate i a-b). On Piet de Jong's 1931 isometric reconstruction of the ground plan, an 'Entrance Porch' was conjecturally restored e of Room 6b, starting at basement level and ascending up to Room 6b (Hall of the Stepped Doorways), which was renamed the Entrance Hall (plan 20). This room with its elaborate architectural features, such as its ironstone and gypsum floor and the stepped doorways opening to Room 7 (Peristyle Hall), was no doubt considered as an appropriate 'reception hall' for such a lavish building. Neither Evans nor Mackenzie considered the doorway leading from the SE Court into Corridor 33 as the main entrance to the building (plates 1 0, 4 #, 7 ¿, plan 13). There are indications that this doorway, which was identified only by Doll, was found blocked and therefore missed by Mackenzie, who made no reference to its existence in the notebooks.44 Proof of the state in which the doorway was found comes from several photographs dating from 1908-31, in which it is shown filled by three large and re-used limestone blocks (plate 7 b). Two were set on courses starting from the level of the threshold, whereas the third was positioned obliquely immediately to the w. Today the doorway's threshold lies covered with cement and only part of its E gypsum doorjamb remains in situ. The limestone blocks, which obstructed the doorway, have been added to the wall, immediately w of the doorway. THE INTERIOR OF THE LITTLE PALACE AND ITS LAYOUT The Basement This rectangular component, which was set 3 m lower than the rest of the building, measures 9.90 m E-w by 1 2 m N-s. It consists of three rooms, two of which include square pillars, plus two staircases providing communication with the floor above and other parts of the LP (plate 4 a-b). The system had suffered badly from post-Minoan stone robbing and occupation levels. As a result not only were the remains of the first floor removed, but the E half of the complex was missing entirely down to the foundation course level. The w half of the Basement, especially at the sw corner, is better preserved with its walls standing up to four courses high. In 1931 Evans recomposed Staircase 4 in cement, providing an easy access for the modern visitor to this otherwise cut-off section of the building. The most striking feature of the Basement is the special care and labour given to its construction. Mackenzie, obviously impressed, was very systematic in recording the series of artificial cuttings made for the basement foundations and the massive terrace walls.45 In plate 4 a-b these cuttings are visible, but in some parts these sections show deposits of stones and probably sherds, instead of the pure soft yellow earth or kouskouras so frequently referred to by Mackenzie. Such loose stone deposits are visible along the central and s parts of the w section, at a higher level than the preserved w wall; along the N section, at the nw end of Room 5, at a slightly higher level than that of the surviving n wall; and finally, along the s section behind the central part of the s wall. Today, all three earth sections around the Basement are obscured by the drystone walling built up against them. These stones and loose earth, visible in the photographs, could be either spoil heaps deposited temporarily by the workmen up against the sections of kouskouras, or filling material for the space between the terrace wall and the bedrock. Alternatively, the builders cut through earlier deposits as well as sections of bedrock to create the necessary space for the structure. Unlike all other sectors of the LP, the Basement bares no traces of fire on its gypsum and limestone building materials. ROOM i: THE ROOM OF THE THREE PILLARS The room was named after the three pillars Evans reconstructed, of which only the base of one had escaped the extensive robbing activity in the area. This room, measuring 4.40 m e-w by 7.80 m n-s, 4S Z)Af/D£*o.v-i.vi.io, *i. 44 For example on plan 13 the doorway was completely neglected, and the exterior wall was drawn undisturbed. The blocking which is visible on plate 1 a was subsequently removed by Platon. 45 DM/DB 2-14.V.10, 26.</page><page sequence="51">4o THE ARCHITECTURE is the largest in the Basement, occupying almost the entire e half of it, with all but the w wall preserved at foundation course level. Judging from the preserved remains, the room could be approached only from Room 3. The limestone foundation course and two blocks of the first course, one in limestone and the other in gypsum, are the sole surviving remains of the N wall (plate 4 a-b' plan 14). The horizontal setback, created by the blocks of the first course, which were set 5 cm further into the wall, was probably not visible after the floor was set in place. The two surviving blocks of the first course, which though of different materials and size are of equal height, suggest that the rest of the wall was built in ashlar blocks with their smooth sides facing s and their rubble-packed backs facing n. The E end of the wall was missing. Its w end abuts the E wall but does not bond with it. To the great disappointment of the excavators only part of the foundation course of the E wall remained in situ, standing at the same level as that of the N wall. From plate 4 a-b it becomes apparent that the central and N sections of the foundation course were missing. These gaps have been filled in today with limestone blocks, in a technique very similar to that of the Minoan foundation.46 The surviving remains show no evidence for an entrance at any part of the wall. It is equally unclear whether there was a window along the wall to provide light. The s wall survives only to foundation course level. Here huge limestone blocks were deliberately employed for both the external and internal faces of the wall. At the E, the wall ends with a massive square block of limestone, which bonds the s and E walls together (marked on plan 17). This block is set on a lower level, either because of the natural slope of the hill, or to provide greater stability for the massive E and s basement walls. E of this massive limestone block stretches a single course rubble wall, which is marked on plan 17. If Minoan, this poorly constructed wall would be our only evidence for the continuation of the Basement system further E. However, the extensive post-Minoan occupation levels in the east half of the Basement make it equally possible that it could be associated with the extensive later remains along the E Front. The foundation, first course and a single block of the second are the only preserved remains of the w wall (plate 4 a-b). It runs undisturbed for the total length of the room, having at its N end a doorway leading to Room 3. The wall was set on a foundation of ashlar blocks and some of gypsum, with smaller rough-cut stones set between them and the blocks of the first course to provide a level surface. The first course is of large well-faced limestone blocks, which vary in their height and length, but have the same width, providing thereby smooth faces for both sides of the wall within Rooms 3 and 1 respectively. The single surviving block of the third course indicates that the wall was constructed in a similar manner at least up to this level. There is no reason to doubt that the wall continued up to ceiling height in the same way. Such a wall of heavy limestone blocks would have provided a sound support for the ceiling and the ground floor. Both the doorjambs and threshold are of gypsum. The two are of unequal sizes, the s being longer and wider, accommodating a wooden vertical beam at its NW corner. The doorjambs, facing e, indicate that circulation was controlled from within Room 3. Of the three pillars that the excavators reconstructed within the room, firm evidence exists for only one. It was set roughly in the centre and in line with the s pillar of Room 3. Further to the N, a square cutting made into the soft rock, which is visible in plate 4 ¿z, was interpreted as the socket base for a second pillar.47 A third pillar has been reconstructed s of the surviving one for the sake of symmetry, but also because of the two cists found N and s of the single surviving pillar base. These two cists have different dimensions. The southern one is the smaller and was found in situ. The larger and badly chipped cist, located N of the surviving pillar, was found according to the excavators slightly shifted out of position.48 Beside the w wall, a flat limestone block set on two courses of rubble looks like a low bench (plate 4 b). Finally, in plate 4 ¿z, a worked and somewhat rounded stone is visible on the floor E of the pillar base. The stone, which has a circular depression on its surface and looks like a grinding stone, now lies on top of the w terrace wall. No reference is made to the nature of the floor, whether it was paved, plastered or whether the virgin rock was used. Since the gypsum pavement by the doorway is at a higher level than the surface visible in plate 4 a-b, it is safe to assume that excavation had progressed below the Minoan floor. Today the room has an earth surface. 4tì DM/DB 30. v.-i. vi. 10, 30. 47 DM/DB 16-28.V.10, 66. 48 DM/DB 16-28.V.10, 28-9.</page><page sequence="52">THE ARCHITECTURE 41 ROOM 21 THE SOUTH WEST STAIRCASE One of the two approaches to the Basement was through the staircase, 3.80 E-w by 1.50 N-s, located at the sw corner of the Basement and which opened into Room 3 (plate 13 b). It was found quite well preserved, with three of its gypsum steps in situ. Today certain architectural features of the room are obscured being either reconstructed in cement, or hidden by backfill. The N wall, which separates the staircase from Room 3, is preserved up to five courses high. The best-built face looks n though the character of the s is hard to assess, being completely choked with backfill. The doorway, providing communication with Room 3, has a gypsum threshold and is located at the E end of the wall. The gypsum doorjambs are of equal size, but the E one has a gap s of it and the E wall, possibly to take a wooden beam. The doorjambs face N, so circulation was controlled from within the Staircase 2 and not from Room 3. The same doorjamb has at its sw corner a rectangular dowel hole; traces of a similar one are very faintly observed on the other decayed gypsum doorjamb at the SE corner. In plate 4 a-b a well-dressed stone block is visible above the w doorjamb. It resembles a monolithic block of gypsum, set upright. This block, which lies today on the floor of the room, was part of a monolithic doorjamb. The block is broken at one end, but has a smooth surface on the other, which would have rested on the w jamb-base. It is not clear whether this doorjamb was made out of one block or if it was set above the present base. There is no evidence that the E doorjamb had a similar arrangement. On the contrary, the dowel hole carved on the s end of the doorjamb indicates that its upright post continued in wood. The E wall, shared with Room 1 , has already been described. A noteworthy feature regarding this wall is the special accommodation made for the E doorjamb. The ashlar block immediately E of it is about 20 cm thinner than all the others of the first course. This deliberate arrangement was made in order to receive the doorjamb and provide a wide enough doorway. Part of the massive terrace wall forms the s wall of the staircase. It is constructed from large ashlar blocks and its main face is to the N. This end of the wall is the best preserved, standing to five courses high. Near its E end, both visible ashlar blocks of the first course have been deliberately chiselled down to reduce their width, in order to receive the gypsum landing. A second wall runs e-w, abutting and largely obstructing the s face of the N wall. Although parallel and of almost equal width to the N wall, it projects slightly further E and differs in quality of construction. It is set on a foundation course of rubble, continuing in small roughly cut blocks and standing up to three courses high at its E end. At the w end, on the top surviving course, is positioned a damaged gypsum block, presumably the pier of the staircase. Only one limestone block ties this second wall to the N wall: it is a rectangular limestone block, set vertically to both of them. It might well be one of the steps of the upper flight of the staircase. The ascending steps start from s-E, with a raised gypsum landing followed by three steps up, the two first in gypsum the third in limestone. At this point the first landing was reached, after which the steps continued, probably w-E. ROOM 3: THE ROOM OF THE TWO PILLARS This rectangular room was the main circulation point of the Basement, giving access to all rooms at the same level (plate 4 a-b, plate 13 b). The N wall at its w end opens onto the ascending steps of Staircase 4. Further E is a narrow section of wall, which supported the staircase. Today it performs the same function though now reconstituted in rubble and cement. Further E still is the doorway opening into Room 5a, with its gypsum doorjambs in situ. Beyond this point no traces of the wall are preserved. A description of the E wall can be found under Room 1 . The s wall is adequately preserved for its first five courses, with just a single block of the sixth still in place. Its e end terminates with a doorway leading to Staircase 2, which was controlled from within the staircase, since the gypsum doorjambs face N. Although Mackenzie observed that the wall at its w end did not bond to the terrace construction, it still belongs to the same architectural phase.49 It was built out of large ashlar blocks, with their smooth sides facing E, set on a foundation course of rubble and fragments of gypsum, which is visible along the central section within Room 3. A section of the massive w terrace wall, which runs for the total length of the Basement and constitutes its w limit, forms the w wall of Room 3. Although no part was found preserved more than five courses w DM/DB 8-1 4.V.10, 27.</page><page sequence="53">42 THE ARCHITECTURE high, it probably continued in ashlar up to ceiling height. Parts of it have been reconstructed by Evans, using Minoan blocks as well as modern cement. One block of the second course and at least three of the third have been recomposed by Evans. Today, the floor is almost completely covered with a pinkish coloured cement laid out by Platon. Two fragmentary gypsum slabs, one in front of the landing of Staircase 4 and the other in the n-e corner of the room, might have been placed there during the restorations. Neither of them is visible in plate 4 a-b, where a flat surface at about the same level as the present floor is shown. Of the two pillars, which dominate the room, the s stands complete, set on a projecting limestone foundation block. The two blocks that follow are of uneven heights, the top being smaller and badly chipped off. Although missing parts have been reconstituted in cement, its two w dowel holes, a proof that the pillar stands complete, are still visible. Mackenzie observed that the pillar was found tilting slightly to the E, and associated the so-called 'retaining wall' with this anomaly. He makes reference to a wall running w-E, set up against the s pillar and running presumably up to the E wall. Since this feature is no longer traceable, there is no evidence concerning its construction, height or exact relationship with the pillar. Of the n pillar, only the limestone foundation block is in situ, in turn set on a slightly projecting foundation course of rough flat limestone blocks. No such foundation construction is visible below the s column, unless buried under the cement floor. Indeed, it probably was not meant to be visible. From what remains of the N pillar, it can be ascertained that it was similar to its complete counterpart. A limestone cist with two depressions was sunk in the floor between the two pillars. It was found intact. ROOM 4: THE NORTH WEST STAIRCASE Much confusion on the layout of the nw Staircase (2.10 e-w x 3.10 N-s) is created by the incorrect 1931 Evans reconstruction. A more accurate description can be obtained through the 1910 photograph and plan (plate 4 a' plan 17). In these, only the first step of the lower fight is extant, which is in complete contrast to the staircase's present condition, where the whole lower flight stands complete with gypsum steps up to the first landing. The upper flight was retained by a thick wall, which also formed the w wall of Room 5a. Because today it stands much reconstructed in cement, observations had to be cross-checked with plate 4 b. The wall, which supported the upper flights of the staircase, was built of roughly-cut limestone blocks of medium size, some of which are in secondary use, including at least one large re-used gypsum block, which is still visible on the side of the wall facing the first flight of steps up. Small stones set in between courses added more stability. The s end of the wall, facing into Room 3, was missing down to the first course, at its w side a much chipped gypsum pier block is still in situ. The preserved remains of the wall gradually increased in height further N, eventually standing up to three courses. A second pier was positioned at the level of the first landing, on the w side of the wall. The restoration of a third gypsum pier, on the ne side of the wall now reconstructed further up on the staircase, remains unsatisfactory. The staircase has been much repaired and built up by Evans in cement, which obstructs much information on the structure. Our best source is plate 4 ay where the staircase wall shows at its s end only a foundation course level, whence it rises gradually to a maximum of three courses high at its N end. At the nw end of the wall is the gypsum pier of the first landing, which has been built into the reconstructed wall in its correct position. The wall, which supported the staircase, can be seen to be built of roughly cut stones and re-used ashlar blocks. A second gypsum pier is visible in the same photograph, probably now the one positioned higher up on the staircase. There is no reason to doubt here that all lower flight gypsum steps are the original ones. Some are preserved complete, though the third step bears traces of fire. The construction above the first landing is all part of Evans's reconstruction. There is no evidence at all for the make-up of the staircase, as it has been restored today. There simply is no record of how many steps of the staircase were found in situ, although as said above, no serious reason exists to doubt that the gypsum steps of the first flight are original. ROOMS 5 AND 5A: THE NORTH EAST ROOM This room occupies the ne section of the Basement and could be approached from Room 3.50 The two gypsum blocks, which divided the room and created a small compartment, Room 5a, along its w end, were interpreted by Evans as a support wall for Staircase 4, since reconstructed as such. 50 Room 5a measures 70 cm e-w, 1.80 m n-s; Room 5, 5.20 E-W, I.80 N-S.</page><page sequence="54">THE ARCHITECTURE 43 The N wall was robbed down to the level of its first course, which consisted of gypsum blocks positioned to resemble a gypsum dado (plate 4 a). Built up against it, at a lower level, is a single course wall of small limestone blocks (plan 17). Although the purpose of this feature remains unclear, the possibility of its being a bench should be excluded, since the wall hardly rises above the floor level. Only the foundation course of the E wall survives today. The s wall has been described under Room 1 . Of the w wall, two gypsum blocks were the only remains preserved for the entire length of the room. The N block has a curious shape: its N half is triangular with a rough surface, whereas its s half is rectangular and well dressed on all sides, a difference remarked upon in both DM/DB and Doll's plans (plans 17 and 14). The block's n side abuts the low limestone wall, which continues behind the N wall of Room 5a. The second gypsum block, which is thinner and well dressed on all sides, was placed immediately s. It abuts the e doorjamb, in the s wall of Room 5a. The wall has been reconstructed in cement to support the wrongly reconstructed upper flight of the Staircase 4 (plate 1 a). The well-faced rectangular gypsum block, according to Doll's plans and Evans's reconstruction, was taken for the threshold of a doorway connecting Room 5 with 5a. The curiously shaped gypsum block, which is to a large extent concealed by the reconstruction wall, should be interpreted as a gypsum pier, although there is no reference to dowel holes on its top surface. This wall was added after the room was finished, and most likely provided additional support for the upper floor. room 5A This small compartment was approached from Room 3 and gave access to Room 5. Its N wall was completely robbed out, apart from the low single course wall in limestone blocks set in front of it (plate 4 a). This single course wall is identical to the one in Room 5, and should be considered as part of the same architectural scheme. The e wall has already been described in Room 5. The doorway opening to Room 3 occupies the entire length of the wall. The gypsum doorjambs face s and fragments of the gypsum threshold are preserved in between them. In both Rooms 5 and 5a there is an earth floor set. All of the walls have been much reconstructed in cement in order to support the upper flights of the modern staircase. Of the N wall nothing remained, apart from a low bench-like projection, which is the continuation of the very similar one running along the N wall of Room 5. The e wall has been described under Room 5. The East Sector The E Sector consists of a series of halls, which form one of the most impressive suites of rooms yet known in Minoan architecture (plates 1 a-b, 2 a-b, 3 a-b' plan 3). Extensive stone robbing and post-Minoan occupation, which ran on a nne-ssw line along the E Front, caused severe damage to this part of the building. As a result, the eastern boundaries of some rooms, and indeed of the LP itself, remain undefined (plans 17-19). The N and better preserved half is occupied by the Minoan Megaron, as Evans preferred to name the two halls, Rooms 8 and 9, which opened e on to a columned porch, Room 10. The system of rooms further to the s has attracted less attention due to their poor state of preservation. Corridor 6a, flanked to the E by the so-called Hall of the Stepped Doorways (Room 6b) make up the only preserved remains. To these, the set of rooms located immediately to the s, i.e. along the storey above the Basement, can be added. This suite was no doubt comparable in proportions and quality of construction to the better-preserved Rooms 8-9 further n. Between the two systems, occupying a central position in the building's E section lies Room 7, the largest room on the ground floor, named after its square and columned court - the Peristyle Hall. Access to Room 7 was through a series of pier-and-door partitions, located along the N and s walls. The original layout of the better preserved Rooms 8-9 was found in an extensively remodelled state, since many of the doorways were filled in with rubble and mud-plaster which transformed them into solid walls (plate 2 a). Although much destroyed and robbed down to the level of the paved floors, the layout of Room 6b and Corridor 6a can be postulated from the preserved remains along the w and nw region. The floor level in both rooms is 20 cm lower than the floor height in Room 7. The difference in level was mediated by the device of inserting two gypsum steps in place of the thresholds of each doorway in the dividing wall between Rooms 6a, 6b and Room 7. The arrangement recalls the stepped doorways leading into the Room of the Gypsum Benches in the West Wing of the Palace at Knossos.</page><page sequence="55">44 THE ARCHITECTURE room 6a: the corridor west of the hall of the stepped doorways Circulation from the main entrance and Corridor 33 to Rooms 7 and 6b was controlled through this 5 x 1.48 m corridor (plans 17-18, 8, plate 2 a-b). Instead of a N wall, a doorway opened into Room 7, which is fitted with two gypsum steps in place of the usual threshold (plate 2 ¿, plan 8). The doorway was reconstituted in cement during the 1931 restoration work in order to illustrate the arrangement of stepped doorways. The doorjamb to the left was partly inserted into the w wall, whereas the one on the right with its double rabbets was shared with Room 6b. This doorjamb was deliberately made wider, since its s end had to be of equal length to a second doorjamb set vertically and following the line of the wall, which divided Room 6a from 6b. Part of the doorway's gypsum threshold was found preserved although no such remains are any longer in situ. Mackenzie reconstructed in drawing a solid wall, s of the preserved doorjamb (plan 8).51 Doll instead of an E wall, added a series of pier-and-door partitions, which formed the division between the two rooms (fig. 18). This arrangement, which appears on his inked plan, was adopted in the restoration and grey cement doorjambs were added along the line of the wall (plate 1 a). No remains of the s wall survive, although it can be assumed that it continued the line of the gypsum orthostate of the Early Facade. A section of the supporting wall for Staircase 32 formed the corridor's w wall, which at the time it was excavated stood to a reasonable height (plate 2 a-b). Only part of the first two courses of rough limestone and gypsum blocks are preserved and incorporated in Evans's reconstructed Staircase 32. According to plan 18 the wall was lined with a gypsum dado, however no such remains are any longer visible. Near the s end, the wall is interrupted by a doorway opening from Room 33, with the gypsum doorjamb facing E. Only the E half of the doorway's threshold is preserved. The corridor was paved with gypsum slabs, fragments of which are recorded in plan 1 7 located in front of the above-mentioned doorway. The gypsum slab fragment now visible in the ne corner might be in situ; other pieces, near the se corner of the room are misplaced. The rest has been cemented over (plate 1 a). room 6b: the hall of the stepped doorways Even though very little survived from this room, Doll estimated its size at about 6.50 x 5.50 m, based on the preserved parts of the pavement (plate 2 b). The room must have been similar in size and quality of construction to the better-preserved halls further n. It could be entered either from Corridor 33 to the w or from the N, where pier-and-door partitions opened to Room 7 through stepped doorways. It was also directly connected to the rooms on the floor above the Basement. The N wall has been reconstructed as series of pier-and-door partitions, with four doors. Partial evidence for this was provided by the two westernmost preserved stepped doorways (plate 2 b, plan 8). These were extended by the excavators for the entire length of the wall, following an arrangement similar to that along Rooms 8-9. All preserved doorjambs and gypsum steps are of the thin-grained variety and bear no evident signs of burning. Of the E wall nothing survived. However, Doll reconstructed the E borders of the room with an arrangement of pier-and-door partitions, on the same axis as the E walls of Rooms 8-9. In plan 18, these doorways were replaced by two columns, through which access was presumed to have been given to the entrance of the building. The room's s borders were defined according to those of the Basement immediately to the s. The floor seems to have been paved with a panel of irregular ironstone slabs, of which only the nw corner remained, reduced now to small fragments held together by concrete. This panel was surrounded by rectangular gypsum slabs of which only one on the w was found. ROOM 7: THE PERISTYLE HALL Measuring 7 x 11.15m, the Peristyle Hall is the largest room on the ground floor. Located at a central point within the building, it could be approached from all different sectors. The Peristyle, after which the room was named, is positioned off-centre, closer to Room 8, creating between it and the stepped doorways of Rooms 6a and 6b to the s, a sizeable rectangular space. The exact borders of the room to the E are undefined since this end was robbed down to the floor level. The room's gypsum architectural features are made out of the whitish thin-grained variety. 51 DM/DB i.V. 10, 62.</page><page sequence="56">THE ARCHITECTURE 45 Three out of the four original doorways of the pier-and-door partitions were found in situ, blocked up with rubble and plaster (plate 2 a). These will be described under Room 8, since all the doorjambs face s. Since all the remains of an E wall were removed in post-Minoan times, the original arrangement remains uncertain (plan 17). Mackenzie envisaged a row of wooden columns extending from Room 10 along the entire length of Room 7 (plans 7-8). The s wall has been described under Rooms 6a and 6b. The section of this sw corner was comprised of Staircase 32: two courses consisting of rubble and rough limestone blocks as well as re-used gypsum ones. The part further to the n is shared with Room 24. Originally its rubble and mud construction was reinforced by a pier-jamb at its s end (plan 17).52 The wall in its present state consists of a two course and regularly built rubble construction, which is obviously a modern restoration. Both sections of the w wall were marked on plans 18-19 as having been lined with a gypsum dado. However, no such feature was recorded in DM/DB and no such remains are visible today. The wall ends at the N with two doorways opening to the room from Room 19, of which the N one was found blocked (plan 5, plate 5 a). The Peristyle The most impressive feature of the room is the square Peristyle originally of eight round columns of which only five, two along the N side and the three along the w, survived (plans 4-5, 12, plate 3 a-b). These bases of ironstone have cracked, damage Mackenzie attributed to a fire.53 They were set within limestone stylobates, now badly preserved and held together by cement. In a lengthy discussion in DM/DB, a layout of the Peristyle was reconstructed with eight columns set on a limestone foundation, so creating a square court in the middle. Reasons of symmetry and proportions support this proposed reconstruction, which was also accepted by Doll. A wall, running nnw-sse, recorded in Doll's pencil plan and visible in plan 1 7 was probably post-Minoan and part of the later structures to the E.54 The w half of Mackenzie's polygonal ironstone paving, set within the central square space created by the Peristyle, remains in situ. The ironstone slabs are held together by cement, which was painted red. However, no substance of similar colour was reported during the excavation. Evans interpreted this paved area as an open-air court, although no trace of any drain was reported.55 The floor around the Peristyle was paved with gypsum slabs, parts of which were recorded as being in situ, such as the three slabs in the space between the Peristyle and the N wall, and two in the w wall, starting at the nw corner of the room (plan 6). Today only one slab remains in position: that at the room's nw corner. The space between the Peristyle and Rooms 6a and 6b was similarly paved with gypsum slabs, which were placed in rows of four. THE MINOAN MEGARON This term was used by Evans to describe the two interconnected halls and columned porch immediately to their E, here divided into Rooms 8, 9 and 10 (plans 6-7, plates 1 a-b, 2 a-b, 3 a-b). All gypsum doorjamb bases and paving are of the thin-grained variety. Room 8 This rectangular room, measuring 4.90 x 6.70 m, had a more limited role in the circulation pattern of the building than Room 9, since it communicated only with the Peristyle Hall, Room 9 and the less well-preserved area to the E. All but its w wall consist of pier-and-door partitions, with four doorways along the N and s walls and three along the E. The pier-and-door partitions, stretching for the entire length of the N wall, were found blocked (plan 6). Before the blockings were recognised 'the system was taken for a wall the visible s ends of the doorjamb appearing like the slope-bases for upright wall posts such as those that occur elsewhere at Knossos'.56 The wall will be described in detail under Room 9, since the doorjambs face s. None of the gypsum doorjambs along the E wall, numbered 6-9 in plan 7, was found in situ. Only a foundation block was in position and this was assigned to doorjambs 6 and 7. Doorjambs 7 and 8 were discovered in the immediate vicinity, probably incorporated into the post-Minoan structures along the E Front, whereas doorjamb 9 was missing.57 Mackenzie reconstructed the wall with pier- 32 This section was the first LP architectural feature to be unearthed by the 24 by 2.5 m long test pit; DM/DB 22.iv.05, 48. 53 DM/DB 24.iv.0F;, 50. 54 DM/DB 26.iv.05, 55. •w PMl, 517. r&gt;(i DM/DB 2q.iv.05, 60. 57 DM/DB 28.iv.05, 58.</page><page sequence="57">46 THE ARCHITECTURE and-door partitions, which created three doorways opening to the E. The gypsum doorjambs, which were found nearby, have been placed now in their assumed original positions along the wall-line (compare plans 17, 6-7 and plates 3 a, 1 b). In contrast, the s wall was remarkably well preserved apart from its E end, which had been removed during stone robbing. The entire length of the wall consists of pier-and-door partitions, with four doorways, of which the three preserved had been 'walled up'. In size, these blockings occupied almost the entire length of the doorways.58 Supplementary information on the nature of these additions can be obtained from plate 2 &lt;z, where the s wall of Room 9 is shown before the blockings were removed from the two w doorways. Although Mackenzie did not describe the building materials used for these particular blockings, from this photograph it appears that the doors had been filled in with rubble, set directly on the paved thresholds. Furthermore these blockings were probably plastered, since none of the vertical beam slots set above the doorjambs is visible. In contrast, such vertical slots are clearly distinguishable for the wooden posts set along the w wall. The s wall seems to have been preserved at about the same height as its w counterpart. No information was preserved regarding the nature of the E-most doorway, which could have been blocked up as well. Today the s wall stands free of all the rubble blockings, with the gypsum thresholds in the three w doorways in situ. Built of medium-sized, roughly-cut limestone blocks, reused ashlar blocks, damaged gypsum blocks and rubble, the w wall stands in a fairly good state of preservation at approximately the same height as when excavated (plates 1 0, 2 a). Near the sw corner, traces of the original mud-plaster are still preserved on its face. This wall is not a continuous stone construction but consists of four sections built between pairs of vertical timbers, which ran the full width. The beams, which were placed on limestone blocks, were not spaced at equal distances. Each slot has been filled in with cement. Doll interpreted these vertical beam slots as upright doorjamb posts and marked the limestone blocks on which the vertical beams were set as gypsum doorjambs (plan 18). Evans followed Doll's interpretation and commented that 'at some still flourishing period in the history of the building, however, these openings were blocked by good masonry'.59 However, this interpretation is entirely wrong; the gypsum slabs visible are simply blocks on which rested the vertical beam slots built in the rubble make-up. The wall was lined with dado slabs, traces of which are detectable throughout the length of the wall; the best-preserved one is situated next to the N wall. The central section of the floor was paved by irregular ironstone slabs, which formed a rectangular panel (plate 3 a). Today only the w half is in situ, with the ironstone slabs badly cracked and held together by cement. The central ironstone panel was surrounded by gypsum slabs, five along the N and s sides and four along the e and w. In the room's nw corner 'a fire-place with a recess below like that for ashes' was discovered (plan 22). Mackenzie made no drawing of this feature, but it was included in Doll's plan of Room 17. The fireplace must have been constructed after the doorways were filled in, since it abutted both the room's w wall and the blocked doorway in the N wall. The preserved section of the gypsum dado along this corner possibly bears signs of fire on its surface starting at 25 cm, which may have been caused by the fireplace or have resulted from the fire which finally destroyed the building. Room 9 This room, though smaller than Room 8 with dimensions at 6.65 x 5.48 m, has a similar layout and uses similar building materials. From it direct access was given to the rooms along the N Sector, via Room 1 2 plus Room 1 1 . The inner face of the N Facade formed the room's n wall, which today stands heavily reconstructed in rubble and cement and lined with a dado of burned gypsum slabs, placed there during the 1931 restoration work (plate 1 a). This reconstruction is probably hypothetical, especially since the wall was almost entirely robbed down to its foundation course (plan 7). Besides no dado remains were reported in DM/DB or were visible in early photographs such as plate 3 a-b. The E wall was made up of pier-and-door partitions, which formed three doorways of equal dimensions opening to Room 10. All doorjambs, apart from the N-most, were found in situ but the three N-most were found blocked. According to Mackenzie these blockings did not occupy the total width of the wall as expected by the doorjamb (plan 6).60 58 Following Mackenzie's sketch-plan: since the doorjambs are 1 .04 cm long, the rubble wall would have been about 80 cm thick. w Evans 1914, 62. m Each doorjambs is 90 cm long, which suggests that the fill was about 55-60 cm thick.</page><page sequence="58">THE ARCHITECTURE 47 The pier-and-door partition, which formed the s wall, separated and at the same time provided communication with Room 8. Here all doorjambs and their four gypsum slab thresholds were found in situ. Originally, the pier-and-door partitions were not recognised, since all the doorways were found blocked (plan 6). The doorways were recognised only when the N face of the blockings was excavated. Then the gypsum doorjambs, which were projecting beyond the N face of the wall, were observed. The doorways had been filled in with rubble and plaster. The blockings were so thin,61 that 'a series of cup-board like recesses' were created in the N face and as a result protected and preserved 'the carbonised wood of the door-posts'.62 Much of the w wall stands today heavily reconstructed with medium-sized limestone blocks and no part of it can be securely attributed to the original structure (plate i a-b). Rooms 12 and 1 1 could be approached through two different doorways, although all evidence for both has been obscured by extensive restoration. A more lengthy discussion on these doorways is given individually under the description of both rooms. The central section of the floor was covered by irregular ironstone slabs, which made up a rectangular panel, very similar to those in Rooms 8, 7 and 6a (plate 2 a). This panel survives intact, with the slabs held together with cement, which has been painted red on the analogy of the red stucco remains found in the Room of the Gypsum Benches in the Palace. This panel was surrounded by gypsum slabs, which were carefully measured to fit the remaining space of the floor. The E and s sections were found better preserved, with four along the E and five slabs along the s side, all in situ. A circular feature marked n and nw of the ironstone panel on Doll's plan remains enigmatic since no traces of any architectural feature are preserved today. The size of the room was much decreased by a 'solid wall' built just inside of the N Facade (plan 6). It was recognised as an additional feature, when the excavators observed that the ironstone paving ran under it. To the w, judging from Mackenzie's drawings, this wall must have extended to the doorway leading to Room 1 1 , which it presumably would have obscured. To the E, the wall, according to plan 7 met the blocked northern doorway of the pier-and-door partition, in the E wall. The wall, which has been removed, has left no imprint on the floor, which now has a uniform surface with no signs of discoloration or weathering.63 Room 10: the Porch The three doorways, along the e wall of Room 9, opened onto a columned porch of which only the central section survived for 1.70 m ew x 2.60 m ns (plans 17, 6-7, plates 1 ¿, 3 a). Although its N and s ends were lost, it may reasonably be assumed that it continued at least E of Room 8. The E- most boundaries of the porch were formed by a limestone foundation in which the two preserved ironstone column bases were set. The floor was paved with irregular ironstone slabs. During restoration work, more slabs were added to those visible on plate 3 a. ROOM 111 THE LAVATORY This roughly rectangular room, measuring 2.50 x 4.30 m, was equipped with a drain outlet connected to the N Drain. Its single entrance was through a doorway in the E wall opening onto Room 9 (plate 12 a). The inner face of the projecting section of the N Facade forms the N wall of this room. The rough, limestone block packing is set in regular courses and includes rubble and fragments of damaged gypsum slabs. Of the e wall Doll marked as being in situ only the foundation course and a segment of wall at the centre. Both are now completely covered by subsequent restorations (plate 12 a). Of the doorway at the s end of the wall, which opened into Room 9, only the limestone foundation below the threshold remains in place, set at a slightly lower level than the pavement in both Rooms 9 and 1 1 . Only the top preserved course of the original s wall is visible, since the rest is obscured by a later wall, built up against it (plans 33-4). In construction the masonry is very similar to the s face of the wall, which is visible from within Room 12. It is made up of roughly cut, limestone, re-used ashlar blocks. The later wall is of rubble masonry and includes re-used material such as badly damaged 61 These partitions must have been about 30 cm thick, since the doorjambs are 1 .07 m long. b2 DM/DB 29.iv.05, 60. 63 According to Mackenzie's sketches, which are on a 1:125 scale, this wall must have been about 80 cm thick.</page><page sequence="59">48 THE ARCHITECTURE gypsum piers and gypsum pavement slabs. A small patch of the original mud-plaster, obviously burned, is still preserved in situ. This support wall was set directly on the ironstone paving which it partly masks (plate 12 a). LM IIIAi sherds were collected from its rubble and earth make-up during the 1995 LP restoration (fig. 3.3: 11-12). The w wall, which forms part of the N Facade, is poorly preserved on the inside, having been completely stripped of its rubble packing. The floor was paved with irregular ironstone slabs of various sizes (plate 12 a). About one sixth of the original pavement near the ne corner was missing, and has now been filled in with cement, as too have the gaps between the ironstone slabs. Along the w, n, and e walls, the slabs were laid to abut the wall, unlike the s, where three slabs run under the wall. Near the nw corner, two limestone blocks have been cut and fitted in such a manner to form a round hole in the floor, which according to Doll's plans is an outlet into the N Drain (plan 18). The section of paved floor between the drain and the N wall is today slightly sunken, no doubt because of the test conducted below the floor to trace the continuation of the drain. The North Sector Room 17 (Lustral Basin), Room 12 (Anteroom to the Shrine), Room 14 (NW Room) and the maze of small rooms to the w and s, comprise the LP's N Sector (plan 3). This part of the building could be approached either from Room 9 to the ne, or from Room 7 and Room 24/25 to the s. Most rooms, when excavated, were extremely well preserved, with some rubble walls standing 2 m high. Like the E Sector, this area had been radically remodelled, since many doorways were found blocked. Apart from Room 17, where roughly-cut large limestone blocks were used in the construction, most walls are of rubble and earth, reinforced by wooden posts either in the form of vertical beams, incorporated in the rubble construction, or as woodwork within the doorways. The building materials in almost every room in this Sector preserve discoloration marks, which imply an extensive fire. ROOM 12: THE ANTEROOM TO THE SHRINE This roughly rectangular room, measuring 3.50 x 4.50 m, served as a communication point between Room 9 and all surrounding rooms to the w, s and sw. Its walls, although exceptionally well preserved present a rather complicated architectural phasing. The discoloured limestone and gypsum building materials point towards a wholesale fire destruction. Near the w end of the N wall, at first course level, lies a gypsum pier, followed by a large limestone block (plan 34). Above the half-burned gypsum pier the vertical slot for a wooden beam has been infilled with rubble in modern repair work. Beyond this for 1 .60 m to the e the wall is fashioned in rubble which projects some 23 cm in front of the line established by the pier and block. Further E, the wall line is still composed of rubble, but there are indications that this segment may have been restored by Evans. Above the rubble, the wall is constructed of mudbrick and plaster, which is heavily burned. At this point, some 1.20 m above the floor, there is a change of material: two regular courses of vertical limestone blocks, bonded by a mixture of earth and sherd. A rather complicated phasing emerges from the wall's construction. Indeed no satisfactory explanation can be given for the projecting rubble, which is set roughly at the central-section of the wall. It does not appear to be collapsed rubble, but a properly constructed feature. Yet it is too narrow to be part of a bench. Perhaps it was some sort of a buttress supporting the wall. The burned limestone block set next to the gypsum pier belongs to the original construction of the wall too and is not a later addition: there is no indication of the existence of a doorway at this point, the two courses of re-used limestone set above the rubble and burned mud-plaster mass may well indicate a different phase of building activity. The construction of this second wall, which destroyed part of the support wall in Room 1 1 , has to postdate the fire destruction visible on the mud-plaster below. Only a few sherds were extracted from the make-up of this later addition. The latest sherds date to LM II or LM IIIAi. The latest sherds collected from the lower courses of the N wall date generally to LM I. The E wall has been completely reconstructed in small limestone blocks. Along the N end of the e wall Mackenzie marked a 78 cm wide doorway, without doorjambs (plan 7). On Doll's pencil plan, the doorway was omitted, whilst on the inked version the gap was shown as having part of the foundation course in it (plan 17). The present wall is entirely re-built; its original doorway has been eliminated. Both the E and w ends of the s wall are occupied by doorways opening to Rooms 18 and 17 respectively (plan 35). The Minoan construction by the doorways was replaced by modern masonry to support the roof of Room 17. A 1.40 m long stretch of wall between the two is preserved for 1 m</page><page sequence="60">THE ARCHITECTURE 49 above the floor level. The wall was lined with a dado of three gypsum slabs; one of the two still stands complete, with signs of burning on its surface. The underlying construction, which is visible in places where the dado was broken away, is of rubble masonry, which included a vertical beam at the mid point. In a crack in the wall, carbonised remains, presumably from a wooden beam are visible at both ends of the wall. These were preserved because the wall was restored, when Room 1 7 was roofed. The E doorway opening into this room from Corridor 1 8 was found blocked by a rubble wall.64 A doorway occupies the s end of the w wall; the rest is a mass of heavily burned rubble and mud- plaster, now consolidated in places with cement (plan 39). The stone masonry seen above the burned gypsum doorjambs and continuing for the entire length of the wall above the top preserved section of the Minoan construction is part of Evans's reconstruction for the roof of Room 17. At 1.76 m N of the doorway, two gypsum doorjambs were positioned 75 cm apart. Their installation is unusual, however, and they cannot be thought to indicate a door as they stand now. They were not sunk into the floor, but were set at the same level as the wall's rubble construction. The s doorjamb has a projection, facing w; the n has its worked side facing N instead of s. The space between the two doorjambs was filled in with rubble and mud-plaster, which is similar in construction to that placed between and above the two doorjambs. In the case of the s doorjamb, the space for the vertical beam slot has been filled in with rubble, in contrast to the N, where the rubble construction is uninterrupted and no traces of a beam are visible. Finally, at the nw corner of the room lie the broken off ends of two gypsum dado slabs with fire marks (MPH 18 cm), which once covered the surfaces of both the w and n walls. In order to understand better the nature of this wall, the description of the wall's w face, which also forms the E wall of Corridor 13 has to be included. The two doorjambs are visible also from this w side of the wall, the n rising for 20 cm above the first landing of the staircase, whereas the s was set beyond the first step. Traces of a vertical beam slot above the n doorjamb are visible, starting at 30 cm above the doorjamb, the space in between being filled with rubble. On the site-plan a blocked doorway was recognised at this point along the wall by Doll, who marked the difference in level between the two sets of doorjambs and included the supposed doorway on the plan with a gypsum threshold (plan 18). There are, however, various reasons why such an interpretation is not satisfactory: between the second pair of doorjambs there is no sign of a threshold, the rubble filling is even throughout. The worked faces of the doorjambs are not opposite each other, as one would expect in a doorway, the vertical timbers are placed in a variety of relationships with the gypsum blocks and finally, there is a considerable difference in level between the two jambs. These two doorjambs are obviously in secondary use and belong to the original make up of the wall, where they were used as bases to support vertical wooden posts. Such wooden beams would have transferred some of the weight of the upper floor away from the rubble and mud constructed wall. The present floor surface is of earth. CORRIDOR 13: CORRIDOR TO THE NORTH WEST ROOM This narrow corridor measuring 3.60 m n-s x 1 m E-w led to Room 12, through an ascending staircase in miniature, which was approached either from Room 14 immediately to the w or from Room 15 to the s. The N end of the corridor is occupied by the gypsum steps going up to Room 14 (plate 13 c). This mini-staircase consists of one gypsum step ascending to the N, that leads to the gypsum-paved landing in front of the window, overlooking the NW Court (plan 27, plate 12 a). Then the staircase turns w for one more step up, onto a second gypsum 'landing', which forms part of Room 14's paved floor. The quality of the masons work is superb, with the upper landing fitting perfectly with the gypsum pier block at the N end of the dividing wall between the Corridor and Room 14. Fire has discoloured white the gypsum pier block and steps of this mini-staircase. The E wall, which is shared with Room 1 2, N of the s doorway consists of a mass of burned rubble and mud-plaster. During the 1 995 LP restoration, LM IA sherds where collected from the make-up of this wall (fig. 3.3: 16-23). M DM/DB 3-20. v.05, 66. From the description, it seems that this wall was not given a plaster coating. If Mackenzie was referring only to the s face of the wall, within Corridor 1 8, this blocking could have happened after the corridor's s doorway and the e balustrade were blocked. In such a case the n doorway would have been the last of the three to be blocked. An alternative interpretation would be that the filling up of the doorway was different in construction to all others, and might have happened at a different phase.</page><page sequence="61">5o THE ARCHITECTURE Very little survives of the s wall, since its E end was removed when Room 1 7 was roofed. It will be described under the N wall of Room 15. The w wall is built of rubble, which has been consolidated with concrete. Several stones look as if they are discoloured by fire. At its n end a gypsum pier was positioned, which almost completely obscures a second gypsum block, positioned under it (plate 13 c). Two square dowel holes were carved at its N end to hold the horizontal frame and the vertical beams associated with the pier block. Great care was taken in the construction of the steps in relation to the gypsum pier: the final ascending step has a projection, which fits the pier exactly. The present floor is of earth, although once at least parts of it were paved with gypsum slabs, since there are traces of gypsum paving running under the first step of the staircase. Only a small amount of pottery was retrieved from the wall's make-up. It generally dates to LM I, apart from one LM IIIAi fragment. ROOM 14: THE NORTH WEST ROOM This room, measuring 3.70 N-s x 2.80 E-w, is located at the nw corner of the building, and differs from all others in that it has a substantially raised floor. It was approached through Corridor 1 3 and its ascending gypsum staircase. The rubble packing behind the N Facade forms the room's N wall, and includes in its make-up fragmentary gypsum slabs. Discoloration by fire is evident. The E wall, which stands only 30 cm above the floor level, has been described under Corridor 13. The s rubble wall is described in detail under Room 15. The w wall consists of the rubble packing behind the W Facade, which includes broken gypsum slabs, and continues down below the raised floor. The wall shows signs of fire, which preserved sections of the mud-plaster, still in situ along the uppermost preserved courses of the wall. During the 1 995 LP restoration LM I type sherds where collected from the N end of this wall. The floor was paved with both ironstone and gypsum slabs (plan 18). The ne corner on the other hand was fine-grained gypsum, although along the N wall the coarser variety was sometimes used. The sw section was paved with ironstone; the rest has been filled in with cement. The nw section of the floor has been cemented, hiding any feature, which might relate to the blocked drain visible along the W Facade. The different stones used for the paving could reflect repairs to the original floor. During the consolidation of the room's E wall, a few sherds were collected from the earth deposit below the paved floor. The latest sherds date to LM II or LM IIIAi (fig. 3.3: 13-15). The room was found remodelled, since the 'E part . . . had been blocked up by a massive wall of later date'. The exact position of this wall, which either blocked the doorway or decreased the room's size, remains unclear since the notebook entry is rather vague.65 ROOM 17: THE LUSTRAL BASIN The so-called Lustral Basin or Fetish Shrine is a square area 1.20 x 1.20 m, whose floor is lower than those of the adjacent rooms. It is flanked on all but its w side by gypsum balustrades (plans 10, 16, 21-2, 23, 36-9, 48, plates 5 ¿, 6 a-b, 13 d, 14 a-b). The space was approached from the doorway at the nw and then down a series of gypsum steps. The N balustrade separates the sunken area from the steps; the e balustrade divides the room from Corridor 18; whereas the s balustrade is simply placed up against the room's s wall. The room's building materials show traces of fire. The w end of the N wall was occupied by a 72 cm wide doorway opening into Room 12 from inside, since the gypsum doorjambs face N. The doorway has been reconstructed in modern masonry, which was set upon the pair of burned gypsum door bases (plan 35). Further E, the section of the original wall, standing 1.75 m high, was constructed out of medium-sized roughly cut limestone blocks, with rubble set in between for stability. According to plate 22, two wooden beams were set vertically within the e end of the wall, immediately N of the e balustrade. These are completely hidden by a modern rubble support set upon the E balustrade and built up against the n wall (plan 36). The lower part of the room's N wall was covered with a gypsum dado, of which one slab positioned next to the doorway survives intact. It measures 1.30 x 0.60 m and parts of its surface have acquired a greyish black colour, presumably from fire. Above the dado, patches of the mud-plaster coating are still in situ. Here traces of fire preserved in the carbonised wood, similar to those on the N side of the wall within Room 14, are visible through a crack in the cement. At 1.75-1.60 m above the floor level, the 65 DM/DB 17. vi.oS, 82.</page><page sequence="62">THE ARCHITECTURE 5 1 wall continues in modern masonry in which the shaft of a vertical wooden beam was included. The evidence for such a restoration is unknown since it is not shown in any plan. The E balustrade, which stretches for 3.50 m covering the entire length of the room, is built out of rubble and several fragments of broken gypsum slabs (plan 38). The rubble limestone and broken gypsum slabs are discoloured by fire. At its s end, its rubble construction abuts the better-made limestone masonry of the s balustrade. The gypsum ledge, which covered the whole balustrade and which is badly broken in places, contained three projecting sockets for wooden column bases. On this ledge was constructed a rubble and plaster partition wall. Mackenzie described it as 'a thin partition', which occupied less than half the width of the balustrade, enclosing only a third of the wooden columns (plate 6 a-b, plan 48). 66 This partition wall rests on the gypsum ledge and is preserved for 1.30 m in height (plan 38). It was constructed out of rubble set in roughly regular courses, well-coated and mixed with mud-plaster. Fire has turned the mud-plaster terracotta in colour. The mud-plaster mix included sherds and small stones. At the s end of the blocking, where the balustrade bonds to the s wall, traces of the mud-plaster coating for both walls are preserved. Here it is noticeable that the mud-plaster of the partition wall abuts the similar coating, which covered the s wall. During the 1995 LP restoration LM IIIAi sherds were collected from the mud-plaster coating of the blocking wall above the E balustrade (fig. 3.4: 13-15). The s wall can be divided into two sections, that below and that above the gypsum balustrade (plan 37). The balustrade wall is built of rough limestone blocks set in four regular courses, bonded by rubble and earth, which correspond in heights to those along the w wall. Between the gypsum ledge and the limestone blocks there is a gap of 1 2 cm covered with cement. In plate 5 b this space looks much thinner and filled in with rubble. Proof that the ledge was replaced at a slightly higher level by the excavators comes from one of the limestone blocks along the w wall, which was originally tailored to fit the balustrade but no longer does. The gypsum ledge, which is 88 cm wide, has been consolidated in places with cement. Above the level of the gypsum ledge, the wall continues in limestone blocks set at regular courses, with rubble part in between as filling material. At the sw corner, there is a large and thick patch of mud-plaster still in situ (plate 5 ¿, plan 37). The w wall is divided into two sections by the N balustrade, located 80 cm s of the n end of the wall (plan 39). The segment of wall between the s end and the n balustrade and below the level of the gypsum ledges is slightly recessed by 5-8 cm, a feature which was included in Doll's plan (plan 22). This sector was constructed out of large, roughly cut limestone blocks. The masonry above the recessed part continues again in similar limestone blocks set in irregular courses with earth and rubble in between as filling material. Some blocks bear traces of burning similar to those on the s wall. The peculiar recess was probably made to accommodate a gypsum dado lining the walls of the sunken area, such as is found along the s face of the N balustrade. However, no remains of gypsum slabs are traceable. At the sw end of the wall, the natural kouskouras is visible below the southernmost limestone block. The N section of the w wall is excellently preserved, even though its nw corner was demolished and rebuilt to support the modern roof (plan 39). The wall's basic construction is almost entirely covered by thick layers of mud-plaster. At 75 cm above the floor level and 55 cm n of the balustrade, a fresco fragment can be seen, depicting a red flower on a white background (plate 14 0). The fragment, partly covered by mud-plaster, was merely part of the mud-plaster mix, which also included sherds and pieces of bone. The N balustrade stretches for 1.75 m, with part of its gypsum ledge set within the w wall (plate 13 d). The upper half of the gypsum ledge is burned. The rubble construction of the wall in itself is hidden on both N and s sides by gypsum dados, which in parts where the gypsum slabs were missing was filled in with cement. At the E end of the balustrade there is an 86 cm high gypsum pier: the space between it and the gypsum ledge has been filled in with cement. The ledge, which covered the entire length of the balustrade, carries a projecting column base at its E end. That part, which continues into the w wall, is today at a lower level than the remainder, which indicates that the cemented horizontal slot between it and the gypsum pier, further E, was reconstructed too wide during the restoration work. The ledge acted as a base for a single vertical beam set above; along the s side, traces of the terracotta burned mud-plaster coating for the beams is preserved. Only the lower parts of the gypsum dado covering the s side of the balustrade remain in situ, the rest has been filled in with cement. On the balustrade's n side, the two gypsum slabs are still preserved bb The visible section of the gypsum ledge is 55 cm wide. If the E balustrade's width is similar to that of the s balustrade, which is 88 cm, then the partition wall set above the e balustrade must be 30-35 cm wide.</page><page sequence="63">52 THE ARCHITECTURE in place. Here a layer of white plaster covers the underlying red mud-plaster, which is still visible in parts. The white plaster was added during modern restoration work as a bonding material between the dado and the mud-plaster surface in order to fix the gypsum dado back to the wall. The gypsum pier, on its three exposed sides, presents colour variations (plan 48, plate 13 d). Starting from the present floor surface and moving up, the first 46-50 cm are greyish, followed by a yellowish surface, which becomes white once the gypsum peels off.67 This discoloration implies a change in the floor level, after which the gypsum pier became buried and acquired (or retained) a greyish colour. The grey surface stops at roughly the same level as the floor in Room 14. Supporting evidence in favour of a change in the floor level within Room 1 7 comes from the limestone masonry of the s balustrade and the w wall where signs of a similar discoloration occur at exactly the same absolute level (plans 37-8). Fire has changed the upper half of the gypsum pier block into white, implying that the balustrade was burned after the floor level within the sunken area of Room 1 7 had been raised. The small descending staircase between the N balustrade and the wall was found much decayed and only one of its gypsum steps, next to the upper landing, was preserved. Mackenzie reported that 'excavation inside the doorway brought out the much decayed remains of gypsum steps originally perhaps 4 in number going down E and if on the analogy of the Throne-Room Light Well' it has to be postulated that a landing at the bottom of these then there must have been 2 further steps down s into the area itself, in the interval between the end of the N balustrade and the edge of the E balustrade opposite'.68 The floor was of earth. Its present surface is set at 1 .60 m below the N balustrade. It has a soft and powdery consistency, which looks like backfill. ROOM 18: THE NORTH-SOUTH CORRIDOR This corridor stretches e of Room 17 for 4.20 n-s m and 1 m E-w. Many of its architectural features have either been removed or lie hidden under repairs relating to Room 17. The entire width of the corridor's N end was occupied by a doorway facing N, which was found blocked 'by means of a rubble wall'. This covered the entire length of the 76 cm long doorjambs.69 The E wall, separating the corridor from Room 8, has already been described there. It was built of small limestone blocks and rubble, reinforced with three vertical posts, which judging from the width of the wall must have held pairs of two wooden beams each (plan 22). A doorway runs through the entire width of the s end, which was also found blocked, this time 'by a wall of rubble and plaster' (plans 10, 22).70 According to Mackenzie's sketches, this blocking was only a thin partition, which did not occupy the entire length of the doorjambs. The lowest courses of the rubble construction blocking the s doorway are still visible from within the corridor, since the walled- up doorway was never opened (plate 14 c-d). The original blocking, which rests on the floor, rises for 52 cm, at which point the rubble was set in more regular courses, continuing up to 1.50 m in height. A rubble and cement wall supports and completely obstructs the E face of the blocked balustrade, which separated Room 18 from Room 17. Originally, the balustrade with its three wooden columns divided the corridor from the lustral basin, immediately to the w. This was found blocked by a rubble and plaster partition, which had a uniform earth surface and closely resembled the 'thin partition like that blocking up the S. door of the corridor'.71 Unlike most blockings, this one was never removed, but today it is only visible from within Room 17. The mud-plaster coating has disintegrated, but the underlying rubble construction is preserved and visible from within the corridor for 50 cm above the floor level. Mackenzie marked on the plan for Room 1 7 'traces of polygonal paving' as preserved near the centre of the corridor, although Doll indicated these as parts of gypsum paving (plans 10, 21-2). Today the floor is covered by earth and no traces of paving are visible. ROOMS 15, 16 AND 2 1 These rooms to the w and sw of Room 1 7 could be approached either from Corridor 1 3 to the n or by Room 20 to the s. Different sections of the W Facade form the w walls of all three. The rooms share other similarities, such as being built out of large roughly cut limestone blocks, re-used gypsum 67 The first 20 cm of the gypsum pier block are badly eroded. As sunken basin of Room 1 7 has no drain, winter rain could have caused such erosion on the gypsum block since the building was unearthed. Gypsum decays quickly if kept submerged in water: S.

Most walls have vertical wooden beams set in them to increase their strength and to add support. In this they are unlike Rooms 20, 19, 23 and 24 further to the s, where doorposts performed the same function, there set within the rubble construction. In contrast to all other rooms along the N Sector, Rooms 15, 16 and 21 bear only a few traces of fire. In all three rooms the rubble fill behind the ashlar W Facade is best preserved up to 40 cm from the present floor level; the rubble masks the back of the ashlar blocks. The rubble packing visible at a higher level might be part of the modern restoration work (plan 46). The w wall of Room 1 7 forms the e wall for both Rooms 1 5 and 1 6, and will be described separately since in its present condition it has a uniform surface. It stands in a very good state of preservation, apart from its N and s ends, where it was replaced by modern masonry in order to support the roof of Room 17. The wall is very similar in construction to the s outer face of Room 17, that is made of large roughly cut limestone blocks, re-used gypsum blocks and some badly damaged ashlar blocks, which are obviously in secondary use. The wall today differs from that shown on Doll's plan, where its s half was drawn wider and included a gypsum doorjamb for the doorway between Rooms 15 and 16. All these features were probably removed when the modern roof for Room 17 was built up. The gypsum pier block located along the wall's s end shows no traces of fire, unlike the corresponding pier block for the upper floor, which is burned on two faces. 95 cm n of the upper floor gypsum pier block a section of the rubble wall rises to a maximum height of 35 cm. The gap between it and the gypsum pier block possibly indicates the position of a doorway along the upper floor. Traces of white plaster running along the top of the wall are to be associated with Heaton's experiments with lime-plaster. Room 75 This 4.20 m E-w x 1.90 m n-s rectangular room could be approached either from Corridor 13 or Room 16. The N wall, shared with Room 14, was made out of both large and small roughly cut blocks of limestone and some re-used ones of gypsum. The largest were placed in the first two courses, obviously to create a load-bearing foundation for the rubble construction above. Today the wall is much lower than when excavated (plate 10 a). On Doll's plan, the doorway at the E end of the wall had both its gypsum doorjambs and threshold in situ. Today there are hardly any visible remains to suggest a doorway, apart from a gypsum fragment standing loose in the position of the E doorjamb. Presumably the doorway was destroyed during the reconstructions or lies buried under silt. The pottery collected from the rubble make-up of this wall dates generally to LM I, possibly LM IA rather than MM IIIB/LM IA (fig. 3.3: 24-25). Part of the w outer wall of Room 1 7 forms the e wall of the room. It has been described above. During the 1995 LP restoration LM I type sherds were collected from the lower courses of the rubble packing for the W Facade. The s wall is very similar in construction to the N, built of various sizes of limestone blocks, the largest of which were set in the first two courses of the wall. The double gypsum doorjamb set at the E end of the wall is much wider than the wall itself, and is obviously in secondary use. Doll marks on his plan a corresponding doorjamb to the E, followed by short strip of wall running s (plan 17). No such remains survive today; the wall was probably knocked down when Room 17 was restored. Some stones bear traces of what could be mud-plaster. The w wall has been described above. The room has an earth floor, with a limestone slab positioned roughly in the middle. It is not clear whether it belongs to the make-up of the floor, or is backfill. Room 16 This rectangular room, measuring 3.90 m E-w x 1 .50 m n-s is almost identical in shape and construction to Room 15. All its walls have been described from within the adjacent rooms. The room has an earth floor. The w wall was consolidated during the 1995 LP restoration: LM II type sherds were collected from the lower courses of the rubble make-up. Furthermore, evidence for pre-LP walls on which this section of the W Facade and Room 16 s wall was founded, were discovered. They are associated with MM IIIA pottery (fig. 3.4: 8-12). Roo^i is the largest of these three, positioned sw of Room 17. It measures 3.70 m ew x 2.50 m ns. The first two courses of the N wall were built of roughly cut limestone blocks, and were fol owed by a lighter rubble construction which included a pair of vertical beams positioned roughly in the a middle of the wall. These were set on a large re-used ashlar block, at 62 cm above the floor, and</page><page sequence="65">54 THE ARCHITECTURE are visible from both sides of the wall. For the wall's E end, roughly cut, rectangular-faced blocks have been used, creating a flat surface, which would have been covered by the vertical posts resting on the gypsum doorjamb. The rubble s wall was reinforced at its N end by a rectangular gypsum pier. Half way a vertical beam was incorporated into the rubble construction, being set 50 cm above the floor level. MM IIIB/LM IA sherds were collected from the rubble make-up during the 1995 LP restoration (fig. 3.4: 21-23). The w wall forms the rubble packing behind the W Facade; whereas the E is described with Room 22. MM IIIB/LM IA sherds were collected from the rubble packing of the E wall during the 1995 LP restoration. The present earth surface along the e part of the room must be at a lower level than that of the Minoan floor, since the E and s walls are exposed in parts below the foundation course. The room has an earthen floor. A large limestone block, measuring 83 x 40 cm, rests in the middle of the room. Its top surface has a circular hollow cut into it, in which lie traces of a clay vessel of coarse fabric partly covered by plaster. Its use remains unclear. Pottery collected from the rubble make-up generally dates to MM IIIB/LM IA apart from a handful of sherds of LM II or LM IIIAi type fabric. Given their small number they may not be safe evidence for assigning a date. ROOMS 20, 23 AND 19 These three square rooms are located to the w of Room 7, between Room 17 and Staircase 32 (plate 14 c-d). They are of similar dimensions and built almost entirely out of rubble. Despite their small size circulation between them was easily conducted through a series of doorways. Mackenzie regularly commented on how dark some of these rooms would have been, and explained their small size as the framework and support for a single room on the upper storey.72 All three rooms preserve evident marks for a severe fire destruction. Most impressive, because of its surviving height, is the s wall of Room 1 7, which is shared by Rooms 20 and 19 (plate 14 d). Its description is presented separately here, to assist in understanding the wall's present condition, where certain parts are modern restorations, while others stand in their original form. Mackenzie recorded that during the excavation of Room 19, its walls stood up to 2.60 m from the ground floor, today the maximum preserved height is 2.30 m. The wall's w and E ends were pulled down and reconstructed in regular courses of limestone in order to support the roof of Room 17. Two of the Minoan features of the wall's w end were placed back when the wall was restored. These are the rectangular gypsum piers, which formed the nw corner of Room 20. Although partly covered by the modern reconstruction, two dowel holes near the sw and nw corners are still visible. The heavy gypsum pier, which belonged to the upper floor, was placed back in its original position.73 Immediately to the e is a segment of wall, 70 cm wide, which stands to a maximum height of 2.40 m. It is constructed out of large, roughly cut, gypsum blocks, with patches of terracotta-coloured burned mud-plaster near the top preserved course. Next comes that second wall built over the gypsum doorjamb, opposite the N end of the wall dividing Rooms 20 and 19. This section stands to a maximum height of 2.50 m but is a modern restoration on this face. Only the remaining section of wall within Room 19 is original. Here the wall is less well preserved, standing to a maximum height of 2.00-1.57 m. It too is built out of large rough limestone blocks. The wall ended at the doorway opening into Room 1 8 further to the n; this doorway was found blocked, and left intact by the excavators. The vertical beam above the doorjamb has been filled in with cement and the blocking is preserved for only 35 cm above the floor level. It consists of rubble and one gypsum block with obvious traces of fire, and starts from the level of the paved floor. The E doorjamb is almost entirely obstructed by the modern pier of limestone blocks, which like the one already described was placed to support the modern roof above Room 17 (plate 14 c-d). Room 20 This small rectangular room, measuring 2.50 x 1.40 m and located w of Room 19, was approached through three different doorways located in its E, s and w walls (plate 14 c). The N wall has been described above. The E wall, which is shared with Room 19, which stood 2.60 m high when excavated but stands today to just 1.57 m. It still preserves evidence for fire in the discoloured rubble and terracotta-coloured 72 DM/DB 15-20.V.05, 77. 73 See also the relevant descriptions for the e wall of Rooms 15 and 16.</page><page sequence="66">THE ARCHITECTURE 55 mud-plaster. The doorway, set at the n end of the wall, has its reveals facing E. It was found blocked, which accounts for the exceptionally good state of preservation of the threshold, with the pivot-holes for the doorways visible between it and the doorjambs. The blocking up of this doorway might explain why the grey thick-grained gypsum doorjambs and paving are not burned. The s wall is a short and ill preserved, narrow rubble construction, which has been completely reconstituted. The doorway, set close to the w end, has its rabbets facing s. The small segment of wall w of the doorway seems to abut the w wall and not bond with it. The doorway was probably found blocked, since Doll marked on his pencil plan the position of only the e doorjamb. Both doorjambs were partially burned. The w wall is the reasonably well preserved, built of rubble and pale yellow earth. At its n end, at first course level, a rectangular gypsum pier is positioned with poorly preserved traces of a dowel hole visible near the ne corner. Another gypsum block is placed at first course level at the centre of the wall (not burned). The wall at its s end abuts but does not bond with the wall dividing Rooms 22 and 21. Today this wall seems to be set at a slightly higher level than the present earth floor within the room. The earth surface has no traces of plaster or paving and, like Room 2 1 , is rather lower than expected in relation to the w wall. Room 23 This measures 2.30 x 1.40 m (plate 14 d). The n wall, which is shared with Room 22, has been described above. Sections of this rubble E wall have been extensively consolidated with cement, making it difficult to define which parts are original. A doorway is located at the N end, with the gypsum doorjambs facing E, both of which are burned. The wall seems simply to abut the s wall. The s wall is equally difficult to inspect since its rubble and mud construction has been extensively reinforced with concrete. This section of wall is thinner than the continuation of its line within Room 22 to the w. The w wall will be described under Room 22. The earth floor bears no traces of either pavement or plaster. During the 1995 LP restoration LM I type sherds, save for one LM III type conical cup fragment, were collected from between the w wall of Room 23 and the e end of Room 22 s wall. MM IIIB/LM IA sherds where also collected from the e wall. Room iç: the Room of the Fetish This rectangular room, 2.50 m e-w x 2.60 m n-s, positioned s of Room 17 and w of Room 7, provided communication to the N, w and E parts of the building. It is the only room with walls which Mackenzie reported still standing up to 2.60 m (plan 5, plate 5 a). The N wall, which forms part of the s wall of Room 17, is the only one which today can give us an impression of how well preserved this room was when found. The doorway, located at the E end and opening into Corridor 18, was found blocked. Mackenzie reported that the blocking was of rubble and mud. Although the doorway was never opened, very little of the masonry visible in it now belongs to the Minoan construction.74 Only the first two courses, built in rubble are definitely original; none of its covering of mud-plaster has survived. Visible amongst the sparse remains of the original blocking is a badly damaged gypsum block, which bears traces of burning. The blocking goes down to the level of the paved floor. Instead of an e wall, a double doorway with the doorjambs facing E led to Room 7. The northern of the two doors was found blocked by 'a rubble and plaster wall', which is clearly visible in plate 5 a. The surface of the wall is smooth and well plastered; it seems to start from the level of the paved floor. The impression of a vertical wooden beam was preserved in the plaster surface, above the middle doorjamb, thus showing that the beam was set directly on the gypsum doorjamb without a horizontal frame in between. The s wall, which has a doorway at its w end equipped with rather wide gypsum doorjambs, has been completely reconstructed. The doorjambs are probably burned. This rubble w wall, which stands to a height of 1 .50 m, has at its n end a doorway opening to Room 20. During the 1995 LP restoration, LM II and LM IIIAi type sherds were collected from the wall's make-up (fig. 3.4: 16-14). Its rubble construction bears traces of burning, in that some rubble limestone has acquired a greyish or reddish colour. The floor and thresholds of the doorways along the E wall were paved with gypsum slabs of the fine-grain variety. They seem to show faint traces of burning. Remains of the thresholds are preserved at the n, e and sw corners. 74 DM/DB27ÀV.05, 57.</page><page sequence="67">56 THE ARCHITECTURE ROOM 22 The sole approach to this rectangular room, measuring 1.95 x 3.90 m, was from Room 23 to the e. Both faces of the dividing wall between Rooms 21 and 22 are similar in construction and consist of two courses mostly in roughly cut limestone blocks, but including two well-dressed ashlar blocks. These last two were set in the first course and are visible only from within Room 22. The wall continues above this in rubble, embracing a pair of vertically placed wooden beams, visible from both sides. The beams were set roughly at mid-point in the wall; they start at 58 cm above the present floor level and continue for a further 1.230 m. The gap they have left in the wall has a diameter varying from 24-12 cm depending on the cement consolidation. The wall bonds with the rubble packing behind the W Facade, but at its E end it has been well squared off, though this part is hidden by the dividing wall between Rooms 21 and 20. Almost the entire length of the E wall is occupied by a doorway with a gypsum threshold and doorjambs facing E. These, of grey, thick-grained gypsum, bear no burning marks. To the s, the wall continues in rubble and ends by abutting the s wall of the room. The s wall was constructed out of rubble masonry, which although consolidated with cement, has tilted outwards in its middle section. The wall at its w end bonds with the E wall of Rooms 28-30, which ends at this point. LM I and LM IIIA sherds were collected from the wall's make-up during the 1995 LP restoration (fig. 3.5: 1-8). The e wall of Room 28 ends here and occupies the s half of the wall followed to the N by the W Facade, which commences at this part. Against the s and w walls, two narrow strips of rubble walling had been assembled. The purpose of this feature remains unclear. The present earth floor is at the same level with the gypsum threshold, both of which are set slightly higher than the floors of adjacent Rooms 23 and 24. A NOTE ON THE BLOCKED DOORWAYS I have left aside the subject of blocked doorways in this part of the building, since our information on their number, construction and exact position remains unclear. Mackenzie reported that 'at the time of the excavation the rooms were taken to the doorless basements and it was only until recent investigation that brought out the fact of the existence of doorways'.75 These were added on plan 9 and referred to in the text as blocked. The doorway between Rooms 20 and 23 must have been opened at a later date, since even on Doll's inked and pencil plans, it was marked as blocked and only one doorjamb was drawn. There is no other reference to the blocked doorway between Rooms 19 and 24, in contrast to the rather unexpected detail on the doorway between Rooms 20 and 19. Here a section of the Minoan masonry belonging to the s wall of Room 1 7 must have been accidentally knocked down when the doorway was opened (plate 14 d). No remark was made on the construction and materials used for blocking up these doorways, but presumably they were of rubble and mud- plaster like others in the E and N Sectors. It seems that by the time Mackenzie drafted plan 6 not all doorways in this area had been recognised, such as those in the w walls of Rooms 20, 23, 24/25 as well as the gypsum balustrade in Room 24/25. However, since more detailed information on these rooms is lacking no specific conclusions about the condition in which they were found can be drawn. The Central Sector The set of rooms comprising the Central Sector are different in many respects to those in the E and N (plate 3). Both staircases leading to the upper floor are located in this part, as are the so-called Storage Rooms/ Magazines (Rooms 28-30), which form a separate unit along the w, approached through Room 31 (the Light Well). Finally the only surviving entrance to the building is found in this section, which together with Corridor 33 leads to the E Sector, but also in the opposite direction to Staircase 34 and Room 3 1 . Alterations to the original layout have been observed in this part of the building as well, but because the notebook references are less detailed, there is little evidence for relating these modifications to those in the N and E Sectors. 75 DM/DB 15-20.V.05, 77.</page><page sequence="68">THE ARCHITECTURE 57 ROOM 24/25 This L-shaped room links Staircase 32 and the maze of small rectangular rooms to the N with Room 7 to the E (plate 14 c-d). Special care was given to its appearance, since the floor was paved with gypsum slabs and a gypsum balustrade supporting a wooden column, was positioned roughly in the middle of the room. Evans misinterpreted the architectural features of the room and identified it as a light well, providing light to Staircase 32 and Rooms 22, 23-76 The rubble n and e walls and their doorway have been described under Rooms 19 and 23 respectively. Instead of a s wall, Staircase 32's lower and upper flights occupy the entire width of the room. The w wall forms an L-shaped projection for its N half, the rubble masonry of which has been heavily consolidated in cement. In its s and dog-legged part a doorway opens into Room 26, whereas at the N end a doorway leads to Room 23. The room is divided into half by an E-w balustrade with a fine-grained gypsum ledge that supports a slightly projecting base for a wooden column. The balustrade has been much consolidated in cement. Between the gypsum pier block and the ledge the space for the horizontal wooden frame has been consolidated in red coloured cement, although there is no reference to traces of colour in the notebooks. Along its s face, the gypsum ledge has acquired a greyish black colour, presumably from fire. The floor, at least close by Staircase 32, was paved with gypsum slabs, fragments of which are still in situ. Mackenzie reported a curving wall in Room 25, which seems to have blocked the space between the gypsum pier of the staircase and the pier-jamb along the e wall (plan g).77 This wall, like so many others, was removed. However, there remain two limestone blocks, which are set in front of the staircase gypsum pier and which quite possibly belonged to this curved wall. Both of these are set at floor level and seem to be in situ. This curious curving wall could have been part of a post-Minoan well, which was not recognised during excavation. In favour of this interpretation are the contents of P. I. 10, which contain almost exclusively post-Minoan sherds. ROOM 26 This room measured 2.20 m E-w x 2.80 m n-s and connected Room 31 with the E and N Sectors through Room 24/25. Today its borders are not well defined, since its e wall was demolished during the reconstruction of Staircase 32. The N wall is common to both Rooms 26 and 25. Although this rubble wall has been consolidated with cement, its middle section tilts out to the s, a proof that the wall is original. The grey thick- grained gypsum pier, visible in plates ioû and 2 ¿, was set at the level of the first floor and is still in situ. Unlike the upper floor pier block along the sw corner of Room 17, this one bears no traces of burning. MM IIIB/LM IA sherds were collected for the rubble make-up during the 1995 LP restoration. What remained of the e wall was probably pulled down when Evans reconstructed Staircase 32. In plan 17 the doorway was marked with only one gypsum doorjamb preserved. The s wall is described under Room 31, its pier doorway, in well-faced limestone blocks, stands five courses high. The most impressive feature of this rubble-built wall is its doorway opening into Room 27; it has a pair of monolithic doorjambs flanking the entrance (plate 9 b). These were found intact, standing 1.50 m high. In the N doorjamb, at 1.15 cm above the bottom, there isa 12 x 3.5 cm vertical slot, into which slotted a wooden bolt for locking the doorway. The doorjambs rest on a raised threshold of limestone blocks, which is at roughly the same level as the threshold of Rooms 28-30. The use of a particularly smooth stone within the rubble construction (near the wall's N end at 0.50 cm up) indicates that this part of the wall has been repaired. Similarly, the top three stones just by the N doorjamb do not correspond in size to those on plate 9 b. The floor is of earth. room 27 The most impressive feature of this small room, 1.80 m E-w x 2.50 m N-s, is the monolithic grey thick- grained gypsum doorjamb, located at the s end of its e wall, where access is given to Room 26 (plate 9 b). The rubble masonry wall is considerably obstructed by a 'support' wall built up against it. This rubble 'support' wall was set at the same level as the other walls in the room. It rises for only 1 .20 cm, but originally must have continued up to the ceiling. The monolithic gypsum doorjamb is not burned. 7t) PAfll, 517. 77 DM/DB 15-20.V.05, 78.</page><page sequence="69">58 THE ARCHITECTURE The rubble packing behind the ashlar wall of the Light Well makes up this room's s wall. Part of the E Storage Room wall forms the w wall of this room. It is built out of large, roughly cut limestone blocks set in regular courses and bonded together with small stones. Traces of burned terracotta mud-plaster coating are visible on one block at 1.60 m above the floor level. The present earth floor level is higher than in adjacent rooms. Some faint traces of rubble, which could be part of a wall running N-s, are also visible. ROOMS 28, 29 AND 30: THE MAGAZINES Evans identified these three rectangular rooms as a storage area, for good reason, because of their layout and position in the building (plate 15 ¿).78 The rooms, in terms of shape, construction and use of building material, are very similar. Some walls are well preserved, with obvious signs of fire either in the form of heavily burned mud-plaster or black-coloured gypsum blocks. The rooms will be described in a different order than usual, starting from the entrance, moving to the four surrounding walls, then the partition walls and finally the floors. Apart from the s walls of Rooms 29 and 30 all others carry strong burning marks on both limestone and gypsum. Entrance to all three rooms was through a wide doorway at the se corner, where Room 30 opens off to Room 31. A large grey limestone block was used as a threshold; this still bears the marks of a pivot hole (plate 15 a). This block was deliberately chosen for its size and thickness; which enabled the builders to create a step up to the entrance of the storerooms. Its height, 33 cm, is the same as that of the first course of both the N and the w wall of Room 3 1 . To accommodate the corner block of the second course of Room 3 1 's w wall, the corner of the threshold block has been slightly cut to fit. The threshold block is set on a nnw-sse line. At its N end it carefully abuts the N wall of Room 31. The threshold, w and n walls have, all at the same level, horizontal signs of weathering, which might suggest the position of possible floor levels at some period. The entrance to the storerooms with its impressive threshold and dowel hole79 seems to have been found blocked, since according to the plans the doorway was not recognised. On plan 17, two levels were given: one at level 1.17 and a second, for the projecting threshold, at level 1.75. On plan 18 the position of a window on the first floor was reconstructed, set above the solid wall. It is suspected that the original doorway was blocked and was found as such by the excavators who never recorded it. The N wall forms the back face of the N Storage Room's Facade, made up of medium-sized, re-used ashlar and rough blocks of limestone; it also includes re-used gypsum piers. Signs of burning are evident on limestone and gypsum blocks. The wall was set on a rough stone foundation. The E wall stretches for effectively the entire length of the storage rooms (plan 41). It was constructed in courses of both large rough and dressed limestone blocks with smaller stones set between them. At the N it stands to heights ranging from 1.40-1.60 m, and bears clear traces of burning both on the limestone blocks and on a small patch of hard, dark-terracotta mud-plaster, which is still in situ in the sixth course. At the n end of the wall, at first course level, there is an opening measuring 52 x 40 cm. It is created from a large projecting limestone block acting as a base, on whose edges rest the blocks of the following course above. A large rough-cut block was placed immediately above, creating a roughly square hole, which opens into the rectangular shaft built at the sw corner of Room 22. Its identification as a drain installation remains problematic, especially since the opening looks over into Room 28 and not a drain outlet. A disintegrated gypsum block could have created this gap in the wall's masonry. The large rough-cut block positioned above the wall's gap looks intentional, perhaps as a lintel. The W Storage Room Facade forms the w wall for all three rooms. It has been stripped of its rubble packing, leaving visible the rough stone foundation course of the interior. The party wall between Rooms 28 and 29 is one of the best preserved walls, standing to a maximum height of 2.20 m from the present floor level, and bearing traces of fire on both sides (plate 15 ¿, plan 42). It is very similar in construction to the E wall, which is built of rough-cut blocks of limestone, the gaps between which were filled with rubble and small stones. The E end of the wall forms a square pier, reinforced by dressed blocks for the first two courses. The fire was so fierce in this part of the building that on the s face of the wall there are still traces of heavily burned terracotta-coloured mud- plaster mixed up with sherds, which was used to cover the face of the wall. Some ashlar and gypsum blocks much burned and in secondary use, have been incorporated in the make up of the wall. 78 Evans 1914, 75. 79 The deep door wear marks, positioned next to the dowel hole, do not make sense given the relative position of the dowel hole.</page><page sequence="70">THE ARCHITECTURE 59 During the 1 995 LP restoration it was recognised that the w half of this wall, down to its first course, was rebuilt. LM IA sherds provide a terminus ad quern (fig. 3.5: 13-16). The second party wall, between Rooms 29 and 30, is different from the one previously described (plate 15 ¿, plans 43, 49). It is not only thicker but consists of two separate walls built next to each other. The s half is constructed of large limestone blocks, which bond with the Facade at their w end. To the E, the wall forms a pier-like end, with smoothly faced blocks. The N half of the wall is constructed of smaller limestone blocks and re-used gypsum slabs. This section was founded on a low bench like projection, which forms part of the original wall. The rubble wall built on top still left a 5 cm projection of the bench. The rubble addition abuts the w Storage Rooms Facade and has a rough face at its E end. A similar arrangement can be observed in the case of the s wall (plate 15 ã, plan 49). The N face of the wall, looking into Room 30, was constructed of small, roughly cut stones with re-used gypsum pavement fragments, whereas the s face is similar in construction to the E wall of the storage rooms. Just as with the party wall for Rooms 28-29, the s half bonds with the Facade, whereas the N half only abuts it; the same comments apply here as to their relative positioning. The party wall for Rooms 34 and 30 and the s wall of Room 29 were reinforced along their N sides by rubble and rough limestone block walls. The construction of these support walls reduced the size of Rooms 29-30 and eliminated the bench in Room 29. From the rubble make-up of both walls and from the earthen gap between the addition and the original sections, LM IIIA2 pottery was collected during the 1995 LP restoration. A later date could be provided by a single LM IIIB type sherd (fig. 3.7: 8), which came from the earthen fill between the party walls for Rooms 34 and 30 (figs. 3.5: 17-41, 3.6: 1- 16,3.7: 1-8). The present earthen floor surface is 15-20 cm higher than the floor level in Room 31 (plate 15 a). Its soft consistency may not necessarily indicate backfill, since this part of the building becomes easily flooded by rainwater. ROOM 31: THE LIGHT WELL This large and almost square room, measuring 4.60 m E-w x 4.40 m N-s, was identified as a light well, even though no drain was found. The room served as a major communication point, since it occupies a central position within the building. Unlike the adjacent Magazines it has no signs of fire. The N wall, made out of dressed limestone blocks, now stands five courses high and must have been one of the grandest in the building (plate 150). The blocks of soft, yellow poros limestone, which are now cracked and badly weathered, were either found as such or have deteriorated rapidly since excavation. The impressive doorway of limestone blocks, dressed on all three exposed sides, is positioned nearer the e end of the wall. It stands complete, since two square dowel holes are visible on the e pier. There are no doorjambs within either doorway pier nor any traces of pavement between them. The e wall, shared with Staircase 32, was 2.40 m high when excavated; it was probably of rubble masonry. By 1931, it must have stood in a poor state of preservation, since it was then completely pulled down and reconstructed in rubble and cement. The w end of the s wall is today completely missing, or buried under backfill and its E end has been reconstructed in rubble. What is left of the original wall is only its middle section, poorly preserved, which consists of roughly cut limestone blocks, incorporating re-used gypsum and ashlar blocks in its construction. One gypsum block was burned only at one of its corners. At its s end the w wall stands only to foundation course level. The gypsum doorjambs and part of the limestone pavement of its doorway, opening to Room 31, are still in situ (plate 150). The n half of the wall is made out of dressed limestone blocks, set in regular courses. All four surviving courses correspond with those of the N wall. Even the huge grey limestone block used as a threshold for the doorway and positioned at the N end of it, was carefully arranged so that its height matched that of the first course of both the N and the w walls. On Doll's plans the floor is shown paved with large rectangular slabs, of which at least six were drawn in the E half of the room as in situ (plans 17-18). There is no reference as to whether they were of gypsum or limestone. Soon after their discovery, as depicted on plate 7 A, these slabs were moved for what seems to have been a 'test'. It seems likely that the excavators were in search of a drain system, which could help identify the room as an open-air light well. However, there is no reference in DM/DB to such a test. On plan 1 7 Doll pointed marked the position of one gypsum doorjamb at level 0.97, whereas traces of the stone paving were marked, at level 2.96. The gypsum doorjamb clearly belongs to the upper floor and suggests that the room was at least partly, if not entirely roofed over. Maybe the traces of paving helped support a column, creating a portico-like arrangement along the E end of the room.</page><page sequence="71">6o THE ARCHITECTURE ROOM 32: THE MAIN STAIRCASE The so-called Main Staircase is located roughly at the centre of the building, and could have been approached from several directions. When excavated it was preserved in remarkably good condition, as the levels marked on Doll's 1910 pencil plan indicate (plan 17). By 1931, it had deteriorated so much that Evans rebuilt the whole structure in rubble and cement (plates 1 a-b, 2 b, 3 a-b, 13 fl). Thus very little of the original masonry is now visible, apart from the gypsum steps and the pier blocks of the staircase structure. The gypsum elements are exclusively made of the white thin grained gypsum variety. Only a small section of the original rubble masonry, of roughly cut limestone blocks survives in the e wall of the staircase (this is best seen from within Room 7). The lower flight consists of fourteen fine-grained gypsum steps, all found in situ. The first landing of which no part of its paving survived, ran above Corridor 33; it was reconstructed as such. The steps of the upper flight had collapsed tumbling down. It continued up with eleven more steps, of which the first eight have been restored in position. The two surviving gypsum pier blocks have been incorporated into the reconstructed middle wall at their supposed original positions, next to each landing. Both gypsum piers bear traces of fire, unlike the gypsum steps. Both Mackenzie and Evans commented on the well preserved, burned mudbrick, found in situ in this area, presumably from the construction of the dividing wall between the two flights. Mackenzie had envisaged a window in the E wall, an idea that for structural reasons was not followed up in the reconstruction (plans 8-9). Instead two sets of windows were built into the s reconstructed wall, overlooking into the SE Court (plate 1 a). Their existence, although entirely hypothetical, remains an attractive reconstruction. Very little is known for the arrangement of the space below the lower flight, but presumably it was filled in with earth, such as the MUM staircases. More problematic is the arrangement below the upper flight, since usually such spaces were used for storage. Mackenzie's opinion was that the upper flight 'was solid below'.80 corridor 33 This 1 1 .60 m-long corridor is set at two different levels, the difference in height being covered by a three-step staircase (plans 17-18). The corridor is located at a key position, since the building was entered through a doorway in its s wall, and access to the s, E, w and n section of the building were controlled from this point. The corridor's N wall was defined by the s walls of Room 31 and Staircase 32, none of which have much of their original construction in situ. The e half of the s wall was formed by the inner face of the gypsum orthostate Facade, which presumably was rubble-packed. To the w much of the wall survives in a very poor condition, with a few limestone blocks surviving in the first course. Further w its line is disturbed by a post-Minoan well sunk down through the Minoan floor. The floor level is divided in two parts by three steps, two in limestone, the third in gypsum. Further w, the floor level continued at a lower level. Circulation was controlled through three doorways. The first, set in the middle of the s wall is the only surviving entrance to the building. Its gypsum doorjambs were facing s according to plan 17. Two more doorways are located in the lower section of the corridor: the first, looking w, was at the base of the descending steps, whereas the second, at the e end of the corridor. Finally at the e end of the corridor, one could pass directly onto the Staircase 34, and N into Room 3 1 . STAIRCASE 34: THE WEST STAIRCASE The W Staircase, being smaller than Staircase 32, attracted less attention, though it survived in relatively good condition, with its lower flight and much of its rubble walls intact (plate 15 c). According to Doll's reconstruction it had only two flights, the upper located s of Rooms 28-30. The Staircase was located at a key communication point, since it was in direct relationship with Corridor 33 and the SE Court, but at the same time with Room 31, which led to the building's N and E Sectors. Furthermore, apart from providing access to the LP upper floor, it led to the Bridge across to the MUM ground floor. None of the gypsum blocks or steps employed in the construction of this staircase bears traces of burning. Unlike Staircase 32 here only the grey thick-grained gypsum variety was used. 80 DM/DB 15-20.V.05, 78.</page><page sequence="72">THE ARCHITECTURE 6 1 Both lower and upper flights are i m wide, with the nine steps of the lower, alternating between gypsum and limestone. On either side of the first step, gypsum piers were positioned at the s ends of the supporting rubble walls. The dowel holes on both blocks have weathered away but the s pier has a square cutting along its sw corner, into which would have fitted some dowel or wooden frame. There are two more gypsum pier blocks positioned in the rubble wall, which flanks the n side of the lower flight: one is half-way, the second is next to the first landing. All three would have helped support the wooden framework for the upper flight of steps. The N wall, which divides the staircase from the storerooms, is of rough limestone masonry. To the w the staircase was built up against a section of the SW Facade, which was provided with a window at the level of the first landing (plan 30). The rubble packing behind the Facade is still visible in the space whence the upper flight sprang. Immediately within the Facade wall, at ground level, a construction of rough limestone is visible, which abuts (or runs under) the N wall, but stops 15 cm before the supporting staircase wall. It is remains unclear whether this is a foundation wall related to the LP, or to an earlier building on site. SPACE 35: PITS A AND B Mackenzie reported only briefly on the 'two rectangular pits a &amp; b' which adjoined the staircase to the s, obviously being more interested in the spectacular steatite bull's head rhyton, which was found within 'pit a' (plan 12).81 What is visible today on site differs from Doll's plans. The n limit is defined by the s rubble wall of Staircase 34; the s, by the N rubble wall of Room 36. A thin rubble wall, abutting the walls at either end divides the 0.40 m wide area into two. The lower courses of this partition wall are partly made up of three flat limestone blocks, two of which were set upright at either end, the third positioned on top of both. These blocks create an open space, which at least in appearance resembles a drain shaft (plate 15 c). The only other feature in position is another flat limestone block placed further s, which again resembles a cover stone for a drain. The floor surface is of pale earth, with traces of the yellow kouskouras along the e end of the n wall being visible. The western space, between the LP W Facade and the partition wall, is Pit A, which contained the bull's head rhyton fragments. The remains of Pit B, and presumably a second rubble partition wall located further E have collapsed, but it probably was similar to Pit A. The most intriguing feature is the drain-like construction suggested by the feature in the partition wall and the flat limestone block placed further to the s. The idea that this space was a drain remains problematic for the following reasons: there is no trace of paving or remains of hydraulic cement on the floor, whereas the yellow kouskouras indicates that the virgin rock was reached. The course of this supposed drain remains unclear, since no further remains of it were reported. The area E of the pits is poorly preserved due to the post-Minoan well and does not offer any evidence of any sort. An alternative and attractive proposal is that these pits are associated with the Staircase 34. Hollow pier blocks, like the one found s of the lower landing, are usually positioned between the two flights of a staircase. However in the case of Staircase 34 this block has not been interpreted previously as evidence for two upper flights. Nonetheless the whole area of the pits and partition walls indicated, could have served admirably as supporting walls for an upper flight. The preserved architectural remains indicate that Staircase 34 had two upper flights branching off either side of the single lower flight and leading to different parts of the first floor. The South West Sector The SW Sector consists of the SW Pillar Room (Room 36) and Room 37, which form an independent unit approached directly from the SE Court (plate 13 0). Although this part of the building seems to have been disturbed in post-Minoan times, since much of the E half is poorly preserved, yet the walls in certain sections, especially along the w, stand to a considerable height. ROOM 36: THE SOUTH WEST PILLAR ROOM This large squarish room, measuring 6.20 m E-w x 5 m n-s, was equipped with two pillars set symmetrically on a N-s axis, but slightly closer to the w wall. The single approach to this room was 81 DM/DB 1.V.05, 79. Pit A measures 70 cm E-w x 60 cm n-s; Pit B 70 cm e-w x 60 cm n-s.</page><page sequence="73">62 THE ARCHITECTURE through a doorway to the e, which opened from the SE Court (plate 9 a). Traces of fire are evident in different parts of the room. For its w half, the N wall is built out of rubble and small rough limestone blocks, whereas the e section is quite different, since here several larger and better-faced, re-used blocks of poros limestone were incorporated in the construction. Some of these may have been re-positioned slightly incorrect when reconstructed, since their placing today somewhat differs from that visible in plate 7 b. The difference in masonry may imply that the e half is a re-built. The N half of the E wall survives only at foundation level, in contrast to its s end which rises considerably. Due to the wall's poor state of preservation, much evidence for the dimensions of the doorway, which gave access to Room 36 from the SE Court, is missing. Its N jamb has been reconstructed in cement. If the limestone block in the position of the s doorjamb is in situ, it can be ascertained that the doorway lacked gypsum doorjambs. The doorway's threshold lies mostly swathed in cement but the small section in limestone, which is visible, could be part of it or perhaps of the underlying foundation course.82 The wall's s half is constructed in roughly cut limestone blocks of various sizes. The s wall, which forms the inner face of the S Facade, was built of rough limestone blocks and rubble. These are larger than the blocks used for the w wall, obviously a deliberate choice in order to reinforce the gypsum orthostate Facade from inside. Because of the missing w section of the Facade, the space between the inner and outer faces of the wall has become visible: it was filled in with rubble and earth. The gypsum pier positioned next to the nw corner is probably not in its original place. The rubble packing, filling the gaps of the large limestone blocks behind the SW Facade, makes up the w wall (plan 45, plates 15, 7 b). A square gypsum block, covering the total width of the wall, was set in the second course, sandwiched between two large ashlar blocks. Although the choice of this block seems deliberate, its purpose remains unclear, since the space created between the ashlar blocks is rather narrow for a window. The gypsum block is burned at one of its corners. Besides, traces of burned terracotta-coloured mud-plaster are visible near the n end of the wall. Other features Both pillars were set on a course of rubble, more or less visible under both pillar bases. The pillars consist of a projecting base block of finely dressed gypsum, followed by limestone blocks, two for the N and three for the s pillar. The grey thick-grained gypsum blocks used as first courses show traces of fire on their upper part. All limestone blocks are heavily reinforced by concrete, but as seen in plate 1 5 d they were already damaged when excavated. According to Evans 'their surfaces had suffered a good deal from the effects of a conflagration'.83 However, the limestone blocks, which form the second course of the pillars, are badly eroded rather than burned. Since their erosion pattern is similar, they might have been exposed for some time before the room got buried. Finally, the top limestone courses are in part discoloured grey, possibly due to the action of fire. The pillars, even though of uneven heights, stand intact, since there are traces of four dowel holes carved on the upper face of each one. Additionally there are two low walls, named here walls A and B, which run n-s. Wall A was set between the n pillar and the N wall, and wall B between the s pillar and the s wall. Both are of rubble preserved now only for one course, although when excavated they were at least two courses high in some sections. Wall A stands in a poor state of preservation; wall B has been wrongly reconstructed since its w face now runs parallel to the w side of the S Pillar. In plate 7 ¿, this same wall runs on a NNE-ssw line. Both walls were added to the room after the pillars were in position and when the floor level was unaltered. Their original height remains uncertain, although it seems unlikely that they were much higher than when discovered. W of the s pillar, running parallel to it and the s wall, stretches the freestanding, single-coursed wall C (plate 15 d, plan 43). It was set on earth, which lies at a slightly higher level than the room's present floor. Evans reported on '... two large piles of unbaked bricks stacked at the Eastern end of the room' the position of which coincides with that of wall C. From plate 7 ¿, the so-called stack of unbaked bricks looks more like a mudbrick wall, which stood at the time of its excavation to the same height as the s pillar (1.60 m). Wall C, then, is the stone foundation course on which the mudbrick construction was set. The wall, unlike most 'late features' in the building, was never removed, and the collapsed remains of the mudbrick construction, heavily disintegrated, are lying now on the earth floor between wall B and the s wall. Most of them have decomposed through time into a mass of red 82 On Doll's plan the doorway was not marked. 83 Evans 1914, 74.</page><page sequence="74">THE ARCHITECTURE 63 earth, but those partially intact are hard-baked and terracotta in colour. In the course of consolidating this rubble foundation course, LM IIIAi pottery was collected from under the rubble construction. Amongst these only one rim fragment could date to LM IIIA2 early (fig. 3.7: 10-21). There are two low blocks or slabs, visible in plate 7 £, which are no longer there. The first, abutting the N wall, was interpreted as a bench in Doll's 1910 inked plan; the second was set along the w side of the N Pillar. They were both at a higher level than the floor exposed in the photograph; they could have been remains of pavement, benches or simply fallen wall-blocks. The information available is insufficient to make a decision. room 37 This small room, measuring 3.90 m E-w x 2.10 m N-s, occupies the se corner of the building and had a single doorway at its ne end, opening onto the SE Court. Its most striking feature is the almost square shaped 'later well', set within its SE corner (plates 3 0, 9 ¿z, 7 b). The N wall, which must have been found in a poor state of preservation, is reconstructed completely incorrectly and no part of it, as standing today, is reliable. In Doll's plans, the N wall at its w end was approximately 1 m thick, with a short 'projecting wall' set vertically to it. The latter was built up with at least one gypsum block; it may have been some kind of a pier to support the upper floor, similar to the gypsum pier in Room 2 1 . The wall continued further E on a line as wide as the gypsum dooijambs positioned at the w end. The reconstructed wall is, however, narrower, and the doorway has been incorrectly placed further to the w. Only the foundation course of the E Facade is preserved. The remaining s and w walls are better preserved: the s has its e end cut away by the post-Minoan well; the w has its N end robbed out. Both were set on a foundation course of rubble, and built up of various sizes of rough-cut blocks and the occasional re-used limestone ashlar block. The s wall is very similar in construction to its counterpart in Room 36, creating a sound support for the orthostates of the S Facade. In the make-up of the w wall a variety of stones have been used (apart from ashlar and rough limestone blocks) such as gypsum paving, ironstone and sandstone. Other features The rectangular well, cleared out by Platon in 1956, stands preserved in good condition in the SE corner of Room 37. It is built out of poros limestone, shaped into small, and rough cobbles and set up in regular courses. The well continues below the level of the present earth floor. The Upper Floor Very little of the superstructure of the building remains in position. From the notebook descriptions and the building's state of preservation, it is clear that much of the upper floor materials and deposits, which fell within the ground floor rooms with the collapse of walls and ceilings, were found in an exceptional state of preservation. This event took place when the building was destroyed by the fire recorded in Mackenzie's excavation notebooks. In the 1905 BSA excavation report, Evans enthusiastically reported on the discovery of 'many traces of upper-storeys' including the 'two flights and remains of a third' of Staircase 32.84 However, there is no physical evidence or any other notebook reference to confirm the discovery of remains belonging to a third flight of steps, leading to a second floor. On site, many ground-floor walls stand at least up to ceiling level. Two had the gypsum pier blocks of the upper floor preserved in situ. One gypsum pier block is positioned in the sw corner of Room 17 and the second on top of the s wall of Room 22. (plates 2 ¿, 8 a, 10 a). Immediately n of the former pier block there might be evidence preserved for an upper floor doorway. Much attention was been given to the small finds, which collapsed from the upper floor. In the notebooks these are regularly associated with building materials, found in the fill of the rooms below. Mackenzie records the discovery of 'rubble walls . . . and brick materials of room partitions', which belonged to the superstructure (creating a lighter construction too), for the load-bearing walls of the ground floor.85 Evans was present on site when the collapsed deposits, from the floors and Rooms 8 and 9, were excavated. On a rough sketch he marked the find place, amongst other small finds, of three 'upper floor doorjambs &amp; pavement sloping forward from about 1.20 M above floor', 'part of burned column' and a gypsum doorjamb at 2 m above the floor (plan 15). 86 In plates 2 a-b, 3 A, a 84 Evans 1904-5, 5. 85 DM/DB 2.V.05, 64. Ht) AE/NB 1905, 6.</page><page sequence="75">64 THE ARCHITECTURE substantial number of architectural elements are depicted scattered along the E Sector, most of which today lie stacked in different LP rooms of the N Sector. These constitute ten fairly complete gypsum pier blocks and numerous fragmentary gypsum slabs, used either for paving or dado. Most bear clear traces of burning. The upper floor could be approached by two different staircases, which no doubt served different quarters of the first floor. The arrangement of rooms along the ground floor, naturally affected the layout of the upper storey. From the notebooks and published reports very little information can be collected on the excavator's opinions regarding the upper floor arrangement. Sadly, for the N and E Sectors, where the sealings and tablet fragments were found, no attempt was made to envisage the layout of the first floor. Along the E Sector much of the upper floor must have retained the ground floor layout. The upper floor above Room 1 7 remains enigmatic. The series of small and squarish rooms s of Room 1 7 probably accommodated more spacious arrangements on the corresponding upper floor. The pier-like gypsum block projecting from the E wall of Room 2 1 could have offered a central support for a square room corresponding to the ground floor Rooms 20-23. Evans gave some consideration to the arrangement of the ground floor over the Basement rooms, especially since the most striking feature of this complex are the load-bearing walls and five square stone pillars. Mackenzie envisaged above Rooms 1 and 3, a large hall with four columns supported by the four pillars of the basement rooms below.87 The published plan for the upper storey differs from Mackenzie's proposal in that the basic features of the ground floor were maintained (plans 1 7- 18, 14). On Doll's plans the basic layout of the ground floor was maintained, in the form of two columned rooms corresponding to the pillared ones below. But this upper level formed, according to Evans, 'an isolated projection cut off by the light area in front'. He envisaged access to it through two doorways, which connected the system to different parts of the LR One of them, located near the nw corner of the structure, opened out to the Room 6. The other doorway was positioned at the n end of the w wall, opening into Room 3 as well, providing direct communication between the Basement and Room 36. The doorway's exact position was set in relation to the Causeway. There is no reference to the make up of the ceiling, even though it could have been calculated quite accurately, since one pillar stood complete and the upper floor level was presumably the same as the floor level of Room 6. The reconstruction of a third pillar in Room 1 should be considered correct, since it would have created sufficient support for the se end of the upper floor. Both reconstructions are possible, adding more spacious rooms S of Room 7 and 6. Conjectural Reconstruction of the Basement's Ceiling and Upper Floor88 No reference is made to ceiling heights, even though these could have been calculated quite accurately. For instance, since the S Pillar of Room 3 stands complete it is possible to determine levels on ground and upper floors, as well as ceiling heights within Room 3, with the series of measurements given on Doll's pencil plan. According to Doll's plan, the floor surface in Room 3 is at level 6.73; the top of the S Pillar at level 4.66; and the floor in Room 6 at level 7.69. The S Pillar is set on a projecting base 80 cm sq. and 38 cm high, followed by two blocks of 70 cm sq. and 92 cm and 45 cm high respectively. It therefore rises 1.75 m from the bottom to the top of its base. Yet according to Doll's figures the distance from the floor of Room 3 to the top of pillar is 2.07 m. The 32 cm gap between the two sets of figures implies that the excavation had progressed far below the true floor level. This hypothesis can be indirectly confirmed by one of Platon's photographs dating from the 1956 LP restoration. In Room 3 a layer of pebbles was set above the earthen floor, subsequently covered by the pink-coloured cement, which forms the room's present floor surface. There are good reasons to assume that the upper floor level over Room 3 was the same as that in Rooms 6a and 6b that is at level 3.12. The floor levels of both Room 6 and Corridor 33 are c. 25 cm lower than all other LP ground floor rooms. For both rooms communication with other parts of the building was made up sets of two or three steps. This small difference in levels is probably deliberate in order to unify the upper floor of the Basement with the majority of the building's ground floor. So the distance between the top of the pillar and the upper storey floor level would have been 1.54 m. This gap is c. 25 cm larger than the figures given for the equivalent distance for the pillar in room 2 of House C at Tylissos and the Pillar Crypt of the Royal Villa. At both Tylissos and the Royal Villa the 87 DM/DB 1Ö-28.V.05, 28. 88 Levels are taken from Doll's 1910 pencil plan (plan 17).</page><page sequence="76">THE ARCHITECTURE 65 floor to floor distance would have been 3.06 m + 20 cm; the gap between the top of the pillar and the floor above, in the Royal Villa, about 1.25 m. Although it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the structure above the pillars in Room 3, there is no doubt that part of the wooden structure of the ceiling was supported by them. If Evans's reconstruction for the Royal Villa Pillar Room as calculated by Shaw is applied, the 1.54 m distance could have been taken as follows: i) c. 25 cm for a wooden frame above the pillar, on which the main ceiling beam would have rested; ii) 70 cm the thickness of the main beam on the centre; iii) 30 cm half the thickness of the crossbeams set on and into the main beam; iv) 25 cm the thickness of the flooring.89 If, a pillar to upper floor distance of 1.54 m could not have been structurally possible, then one has to envisage the upper story at a level of c. 25 cm lower than in Room 6. The difference could have been easily met with a low staircase of one or two steps similar to that along the n wall of Room 6. BUILDING MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES90 STONE In contrast to the limited range of stone used in the MUM, the LP employed a much wider variety for both constructional and decorative purposes.91 Limestone, gypsum, sandstone, conglomerate, sidheropetra, breccia serpentine and schist were employed in this building in greater or smaller quantities. The incorporation of older building materials in combination with the use of a wider range of stones might also be the result of repairs at different periods in the use of the building. Limestone All four different types of locally available limestone (pure porolithos), marly (kouskouras), fossiliferous and travertine were used in the LP. In the Knossos region, there are adequate sources of this stone, such as the quarries of Agia Irini.92 Limestone and other stones could, of course, have been collected from the hillsides and fields, or taken from earlier buildings, which had fallen into ruin and had been turned into quarries: a practice which seems to have been regularly applied to the LP. Limestone was hewn and carved into the required shape for ashlar and roughly cut blocks, but was also left in its natural form for rubble constructions. Classic is the use of small fieldstones as packing behind ashlar masonry or as filling material behind and below foundation blocks. They were extensively used in the construction of rubble walls, which often were reinforced by vertical timber beams. Regularly they were set to create a level surface between series of rough limestone blocks or even between the foundation and first course of the building's ashlar facades. On the interior, the mudbrick wall in Room 36 was set on a foundation course of small-field stones, a construction that dates to LM IIIA (plate 15 d, plan 44). According to the notebooks, but also as observed in the preserved remains, the LM III blocking in doorways consisted of rubble bonded together by mud-plaster. Roughly cut or dressed limestone blocks, of medium to large size, were used especially for load-bearing walls, such as the interior rubble walls of Rooms 28-30. The re-built section of Room 29 n wall was constructed in a manner similar to its original MM IIIB/LM IA section (plan 42). Dressed limestone blocks were used for ashlar masonry on both exterior and interior walls. Their visible faces were carefully finished, whereas their reverse sides were either cut obliquely or broken off, leaving them with a rough surface. Regularly these blocks were given a roughly triangular shape. They faced into the walls interior and gaps between them, once filled in with rubble, created a solid packing behind the ashlar front. Slabs of pure limestone were used for paving exterior areas such as the Paved Passage, the S and SE Courts, but also on the interior as in Room 1 1. In all cases the objective was to create a water- resistant surface. Limestone was used for foundations all around the LP facades. Blocks of this material served as a foundation for column bases and gypsum doorjambs. The N Drain consists of medium- size blocks, which run along its entire length (plate 12 a). At least one column base and all three cists, m Shaw 1971, 171. W) The building materials and construction techniques used in the LP should ideally have been presented according to architectural phases. However, uncertainty in assigning various architectural modifications to a particular period throughout the building is a determining factor for the organisation of this section. 1)1 MUM, 116. 92 Shaw 1971, 38; Papageorgakis and Mposkos 1988, 8.</page><page sequence="77">66 THE ARCHITECTURE positioned in the Basement pillar rooms were made out of limestone. For Staircases 2, 34 and Corridor 33, a combination of limestone and gypsum steps was utilised, a possible sign of repair or a Minoan fondness for polychromy.93 A heavy ashlar block was used as a threshold in the doorway opening to Rooms 28-30 (plate 150). Finally, a large number of re-used limestone ashlar blocks, some with mason's marks of the Old Palace period, were incorporated into exterior and interior walls of the building. Blocks, which were both complete and badly broken, were included in the construction of rubble walls in the interior. All these uses of limestone date to the Neo-palatial period. Finally a note should be made of signs of fire preserved on the surface of limestone. In the LP, occasionally, the yellowish buff limestone has a colour ranging between orange to reddish, sometimes the colour variations occur on the same stone surface side by side. In another discoloration limestone acquires a homogeneous greyish colour. The latter should not be confused with a greyish black colour caused by water and possibly lichen developing on the stone's surface. Gypsum Gypsum is the second most frequent type of stone employed in the construction of the LP. Two varieties have been noticed: a fine-grained type, which usually is whiter in colour, and a coarser crystalline one, which tends to disintegrate crystal by crystal after it has been exposed to weather for a long time.94 Gypsum, which is relatively easy to work, was locally available from the deposits of the Gypsades Hill.95 Because smoothly faced gypsum can create an elegant impression, it often combined structural and decorative needs for both the exterior and interior of the building. There are six different sections of the LP exterior walls where gypsum orthostates were positioned in the first course. The choice is deliberate in that gypsum occurs in the most 'visible' facades, namely those to the n and s. In all examples the coarser-crystalline type of gypsum was preferred. The gypsum orthostates were set, at some height above the floor level, on projecting limestone foundation courses, which protected the stones from the damp and ground water (plans 27, 29, 31). Still, the general preference of Knossian masons for gypsum along the lowest courses of exterior walls remains enigmatic, considering the low resistance of gypsum to water. The use of gypsum orthostates along the Early Facade is associated with the pre-LP building, whereas all others seem to belong to the initial Neo- palatial construction. The courses above the gypsum slabs were continued in limestone ashlar blocks, which sometimes projected slightly presumably to protect the gypsum below. The narrow strip of limestone placed sometime between LM IB and LM II on the pavement in front of the N Storage Room Facade, protected the gypsum orthostate there from rainwater and damp.96 In the interior of the LP different architectural uses were made of gypsum in a typical Neo-palatial manner. They were fashioned into balustrades with column bases, piers, pier-jambs and doorjambs, all of which were used as the supporting base on which wooden frames and vertical beams rested. Gypsum was also shaped into slabs for floors, thresholds and dados, or steps for staircases. Doorjamb bases set directly upon the floor level were an attractive doorway feature, providing a slightly raised and flat surface for the wooden frame into which the vertical beams and rubble construction were keyed. Dowel holes, cut for the wooden framework are rather rare, but two badly preserved examples are still visible on the e doorjamb at Staircase 2. A regular Neo-palatial practice at Knossos was to replace the wooden frame of the doorway with monolithic blocks of gypsum, which continued the shape and dimensions of the doorjamb (plate 9 b). Apart from the LP monolithic gypsum doorjambs, other well-known Knossian examples are the two doorways leading to the three-pillared basement of the South House and two doorways in the Temple Tomb. Evans considered them as evidence for shortage of wood at Knossos after MM IIIA.97 In the LP, the doorway opening into Room 27 has its monolithic gypsum doorjambs standing intact. The choice of fitting out this particular doorway with gypsum could be arbitrary, but the doorway was much in view being located on the route from the s entrance and stairway 34 via Room 3 1 , towards Staircase 32 and Room 7. This LP example is informative in other ways too: a rectangular slot in the surface of the N doorjamb provides some evidence on how the wooden doors were locked. The doorway opening to Room 7 from Room 25 had on one of its sides a pier-jamb instead of a doorjamb. Pier-jambs combined the function of a doorjamb with a pier in those doorways where a larger than 93 Best seen at the Palatial Building of Archanes, the 'Villa' of Myrtos-Pyrgos and in the Minoan Hall of Building 6 at Palaikastro: Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki 1997, 143-4; Cadogan 1978; MacGillivray et al 1998, 225 fig. 3. 94 Papageorgakis and Mposkos iq88, 3. 95 Shaw 1971, 43. 96 DM/DB 13.vi.08, 72. 97 PMII, 518-19 and 565.</page><page sequence="78">THE ARCHITECTURE 67 usual base was required to support the associated wood and rubble construction. In this case, which is the only example in the building, the pier-jamb is aligned with one of the Peristyle Hall column bases, and was presumably set in this position to help support part of the ceiling. On balustrades the attractive appearance of gypsum was combined with a practical need, since all LP examples included one or more bases to support wooden columns (plates 5 ¿, 6 a-b, 14c). The use of gypsum slabs for paving interior areas was not arbitrary. There was obviously a deliberate choice involved, such as for Rooms 9, 8, 19 and Corridor 18. In Rooms 12 and 17 parts of the walls were lined with gypsum dados (plans 22, 35, 37-9), which covered the rubble and mud-plaster construction. The dado slabs in both Rooms 1 2 and 1 7 are still in situ, and so is the mud-plaster, used as the bonding material between the slabs and the wall. The large number of loose gypsum slabs, now stacked in various rooms of the building, probably indicates that some upper floor rooms were paved. However, the size and thickness of these slabs do not permit one to distinguish between those used for dados and those for paving. The choice of either the white thin-grained or the grey thick-grained gypsum varieties is deliberate. Along the E Sector the thin-grained variety features in all dados, paving slabs and doorjambs. The same applies to the steps and gypsum pier blocks of the Staircase 32. All gypsum balustrades (Room 17 and 24/25) and Room 17 dado slabs are also of the thin-grain variety. For the remaining parts of the building, the use of the grey thick-grained variety is almost universal. Finally a great number of damaged gypsum blocks and slabs were incorporated in the construction of rubble walls. Other Stones The following stone types were used for various purposes within the LP, but in much lesser quantities than limestone and gypsum. Sandstone and conglomerate were used within the rubble construction of various walls. A few flakes of schist were set between the ashlar courses along the W Facade. Ironstone (sidheropetra) slabs formed the central paving panels in Rooms 6a, 7, 8 and 9 (plate 3 a-b). Ironstone created a striking contrast with the gypsum slabs which formed a border around the central panels. Two column bases - one of veined breccia, the other of serpentine - are the only instances where such stones were used, combining structural and decorative purposes within the building. WOOD Since large sections of the building were found filled with the debris occasioned by a fire destruction, significant remains of wood must have been uncovered during the excavation. However, references to carbonised wood are rare, even though Mackenzie described in some detail parts of the building where the evidence for a fire destruction was overwhelming. There are two instances in the notebooks where decayed woodwork is reported. The 'rubble and plaster partitions', built up in all four doorways between Rooms 8 and 9, caused the better preservation of the doorjamb's vertical woodwork, reported as carbonised.98 Since most LP blockings were pulled down in 1908, the preserved carbonised woodwork was removed as well, leaving in situ only the gypsum doorjambs." Furthermore, remains of burned wood were reported in the sunken area of Room 17, immediately below the level of the balustrade.100 Subsequent restoration work and natural weathering have erased virtually all remains of wood that might have been left in situ at after the end of the excavation. Fragments of highly carbonised wood are still visible on both sides of the wall between Rooms 12 and 17. They must belong to a wooden post incorporated vertically within the rubble wall structure. Although the excavators made no reference to the types of wood used specifically in this building, it can be assumed that locally available material such as cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) and fir, were used in the construction.101 Wood was extensively used in a variety of ways within the construction of the LP. A contrast in its use can be observed between the N, E Sectors and the Central Sector and Basement. In the former, wood was not only used for columns, but also as vertical beams within the rubble wall. On the other hand, none of the walls of the Magazines (Rooms 28-30) or the Basement had vertical timbers in their masonry. A similar contrast can be observed between the S and N Sectors of the MUM. In this respect it may not be accidental that the N Sector of the MUM, which had no vertical timbers in its rubble construction, suffered less from the LM II fire and was as a result re-occupied. However, the 98 DM/DB 29.iv.05, 60. 99 These blockings had already been removed at the time when Heaton's 1910 photograph of the Minoan Megaron was taken. 100 DM/DB 4.V.05, 69. 101 Shaw 1971, 134-5-</page><page sequence="79">68 THE ARCHITECTURE S Sector, with its thin rubble walls and vertical timber supports suffered from the fierce LM II fire destruction and was abandoned, choked with destruction debris. In the LP there are two instances where evidence for its use on the exterior of the building is still preserved. Along the W Facade, a wooden beam (or beams) was set horizontally between the second and third courses of the ashlar wall for a length of 5.40 metres (plan 28). The long-disintegrated beam left a horizontal slot of 15 cm width between the ashlar blocks, which give us the maximum measurement of the original beam. Similar arrangements, of a horizontal beam set within an ashlar wall, are more common in light wells rather than exterior walls. In our example, the beam runs across a vertical recess in the ashlar wall; no doubt such an arrangement made the wall flexible and thus resistant to earthquakes. In addition the substantial number of timber crossbeams were used for the Bridge connecting the LP to the MUM.102 The s end of the W Facade with its vertical timber is the only surviving original Neo-palatial section of the Facade. A third possible example of a horizontal wooden beam used on a Facade wall might have existed at the NW corner of the building. The corner block in the fourth course had two square dowel holes on its upper surface, both of which are obscured by a corner block placed after the excavation on top (plate 10 0). According to Doll's plans, the block was not re-used, since the dowel holes were interpreted as evidence for a wooden beam placed horizontally along the ashlar Facade. On the elevation for the gypsum balustrade and wooden column for Room 1 7 the 'level of timber in the n wall of N-W Room' was included (plan 25).103 However, the use of a horizontal beam along the corner of an exterior wall remains problematic. Vertical beams were added in the construction of rubble walls to create lighter but at the same time stable walls, since they helped in transferring down the weight of upper floors and ceilings.104 There is evidence for at least ten different vertical posts of which only the slots are preserved - either hollow or filled in with cement. Although none today stands complete, they probably continued up to the ceiling. Likewise uncertain are their exact shape and sizes since the rubble walls have been reinforced with cement, although none seems to be wider than 15-20 cm. The timbers, usually set in pairs of two one in each face of the wall, were probably left relatively round and therefore covered with a mud-plaster coating, packed around them after the beams were set within the wall. In all LP examples they were set on the flat surface of a limestone base-block; the size of the block and the distance above the floor level on which the beam was positioned may vary. Four wooden beams were set, in pairs at corresponding points on either sides of the dividing walls, between Rooms 16, 21 and 22. They rested on large limestone blocks at about 55-65 cm above the present floor level. The walls up to the level of the wooden posts are built of large limestone blocks. Above this level, there is a change in the type of construction as the wall continues in a lighter building material, namely rubble and mud. Judging from the width of the wall, six beams in sets of three were placed in the wall dividing Room 7 from Corridor 1 8, all have been filled in with cement. Because the wall was reinforced with cement on both sides, the stones or blocks on which the beams rested are also obscured. Unlike the vertical beams in Rooms 16, 22, 20 referred to above, in this wall they were set closer to the floor level. A similar function to that of vertical beams, i.e. that of providing additional support and stability to a rubble wall, was offered by the woodwork set vertically above the gypsum doorjambs. Thus, in the rather narrow rubble walls of Rooms 20, 19, 23 and 24, the doorjamb woodwork replaced vertical beams. The same principal was applied in the pier-and-door partitions of Rooms 6, 8 and 9. It seems that remains of a horizontal beam slot, in the w wall of Room 8, were very clear at the time when the room was excavated since both Doll and Evans made references to them. On the elevation for the n balustrade and column in Room 17, Doll marked the 'line of timber in the Great Megaron' at 1.725 metres above the floor in Room 12 (plan 25). 105 Evans repeated this information in a more inaccurate manner noting that the wall's vertical beams 'were traversed by horizontal beams' set above.106 The height at which the w wall of Room 17 is preserved (1.80 metres above the floor of Room 12) probably marks the position of a horizontal beam, which was included in the rubble masonry (plan 37). Evidence exists for at least 1 5 different wooden columns in the building: five of which were set at a considerable height above the floor level on gypsum balustrades (Rooms 25 and 17) and a further 102 MUM, 117 and 104. 103 Evans 1Q14, 64 fig. 78. 104 Shaw 1971, 144; Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki 1997, 137. 105 Evans 1914, 64 fig. 78. 106 PMII, 514.</page><page sequence="80">THE ARCHITECTURE 69 seven were set on stone column bases next to the floor (Rooms 7 and 10). In all rooms, apart from Room 17, our only evidence for wooden columns are the bases on which they were set. Evans published in detail Doll's observations on the wooden columns in Room 17 (plans 18-19).107 A rubble and mud wall was built up against and partly round the three columns, which were embedded about one third. It is the convex fluting on the shafts of the columns which left an impression in the rubble and mud blocking wall. Doll estimated that each column had fifteen flutes. The columns are preserved up to 1.10 m and their maximum diameter was estimated at 12.47 cm- ^n all the drawings, the columns have been restored with no downward taper. Evans in PM records that Fyfe, who took the original measurements, observed a downward taper. He may have reached this conclusion by misinterpreting the slight tilting of the E rubble wall.108 At Archanes, the existence of a downward taper has been confirmed on the preserved remains of wooden columns set above stone column bases.109 A substantial number of large wooden beams must have been used to support the floors of the upper storeys but no wall has preserved evidence as to how these fitted the stone construction. From the present architectural remains no evidence exists for the use of timbers as part of floors or thresholds on the ground floor. Vertical beams and horizontal frames were set on doorjamb bases, pier-jambs, pillars and piers. Window sills were attached to the ashlar blocks by wooden dowels. The dowel holes for the horizontally placed wooden sill in the SW Facade were set 1.20 metres apart. SPECIAL USES OF STONE IN RELATION TO WOOD Column bases, pillars and piers all performed the same function; mainly to transfer the load of the weight of the ceiling beams and upper floor walls directly down the ground level, in order to decrease the weight supported by the rubble walls. Column Bases Apart from their attractive appearance, column bases held wooden columns, which supported the load of the architrave. In the LP, wooden columns rested on stone bases, which were either set in the floor or on parapet bases on gypsum balustrades at some height above the floor level. A variety of stones were used for those bases set in the floor: pure limestone, sidheropetra (Tripolis limestone or platey, crystalline limestone), green opheiolite (serpentine) and veined breccia. Equally diverse are the shapes they took: cylindrical, drum-shaped, disc-shaped and square.110 The column bases in both Rooms 7 and 10 project up to 20 cm above the present paved floor. They were set within limestone stylobates, of which only the top, set at floor level, was visible. In the gypsum balustrades of Rooms 17 and 25, the column base was cut out of the same block as the balustrade slab and stood slightly proud. The various loose column bases found scattered on the site probably supported wooden columns located on the upper floor. CATALOGUE OF COLUMN BASES IN SITU 1. Room 7: Four out of eight column bases preserved in situ (plate 3 b). Made out of sidheropetra (Tripolis limestone or crystalline limestone), which in places has cracked. Cylindrical in shape with a taper towards the top, projecting 10-15 cm above the floor level. All column bases were set within a 'stylobate' of limestone.111 2. Room 10: Only two column bases (MD 53 cm) found in situ (plate 3 a). Made out of pure limestone, cylindrical in shape and projecting only 6 cm above the floor level. Both were set in within a 'stylobate' of limestone. 3. Room 17: Three parapet bases on the gypsum balustrade, set along the room's E wall (plan 22). 4.

Presumably this fragment is the one described by Evans as 'part of burned column' fallen from the upper floor (H. 20 cm and MPD 55-60 cm) (visible in plate 4 a-b).U2 2. Square column base of green opheiolite ('serpentine') lying now by the E Front. Possible provenance: the upper floor of the Basement? (H 30 cm, measuring 48 by 43 cm). 3. Cylindrical column base of veined breccia, much chipped; now lying along the E Front. Possible provenance, the upper floor of Basement (MH 30 cm and diam. 56 cm). 4. Cylindrical base of pure limestone, with taper towards the top, the rest less well worked. Lying now in Room 3 at the Basement, presumably fallen from upper floor (H 29 cm and diam. 46 cm). Pillars The two largest Basement rooms (Rooms 1 and 3) and Room 36 were dominated by square stone pillars, positioned to help support the wooden beams for the upper floor (plates 4 a-b, 7 ¿, plans 32, 44-5). Both pillars in Room 36 stand complete, as does the s pillar in Room 3. All of these had four square dowels cut near the edges of the upper surface of the topmost block. Each pillar is set on a projecting base of gypsum or limestone, which in some cases rests on a course of rubble. The square pillar blocks are bonded to each other by a thin layer of clay. The s pillars in both Rooms 3 and 36 belong to the 'multi-block' type, since they include more than one square block; whereas the N pillar in Room 36 belongs to the 'low block' type, with a single block above its projecting gypsum base.113 The difference in height between the two pillars in Room 36 was filled with a wood and rubble construction. Gypsum Piers Unlike free-standing pillars, which dominate the layout of a room, pier blocks - though performing a similar function - were embedded into the make-up of a wall (plan 34).114 All LP examples are in gypsum, of a square or a rectangular shape. They formed a secure base for the elements of the wooden frame and for the vertical posts, which were intended to help provide strength and stability to the walls. In most cases the mortises on the piers' upper surface, on which a wooden frame was positioned, are not visible, since they are today hidden under ancient masonry or modern reconstructions. The gypsum piers found incorporated in LP walls performed a variety of functions. The rectangular pier set next to the floor at the sw exterior corner of Room 1 7 strengthened the corner of the wall, but also helped support the corresponding square pier along the upper floor, which was found in situ above it. The pier set at the w end of the N wall in Room 1 2 helped reinforce the end of the wall (plate 34). In Room 17, the tall gypsum pier at the E end of the n parapet supported the horizontal beam between it and the gypsum balustrade above (plate 13 d). In Rooms 8 and 9 a gypsum pier was set between the doorjambs along the E walls of the two rooms. Square piers served as bases for all staircase structures, their size and shape being determined by the dimensions of the staircase. Most intriguing is one particular gypsum pier positioned on the left side of the lower flight of Staircase 34: this is of the 'hollow type' known otherwise only from the Palace (plate 15 c). Apart from the three-square dowels cut into its top surface, there is a rectangular hollow in place of the block's sw corner. Shaw, writing about the Palace examples interpreted these hollows acting as sockets to take the vertical shafts which helped stabilise the horizontal frame set above, on which in turn rested the wooden beams of the staircase.115 The LP example slightly differs from the Palace ones in that the hollow was not set in the middle of the pier, but rather at one of the corners. MUDBRICK The excavators regularly reported use of mudbrick on the upper floor.116 Mackenzie regularly described the deposits in Rooms 17, 18, 20, 19, 23 and 24 as terracotta in colour, caused by fire, which discoloured the mud-plaster and sun-dried bricks employed in the upper floor construction.117 The same mudbricks were mentioned by Evans, who reporting on the area w of Room 7 noted that the bricks were about 112 AE/NB 1005, 6. 113 The different types of pillars have been identified according to Shaw 1971, 170-2. 114 Shaw 1971, 172. 115 Shaw 1971, 174 and fig. 202; /Will, 483-4, figs. 336-7. 116 Evans 1904-5, 4 fig. 1; Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki !997. *37- . . . . 117 DM/DB 2.V.05, 64.

In 1 908 Evans recorded the discovery of a 'mass of bricks (stored) in the SW Pillar Room (Room 36) which were interpreted as evidence for an intended restoration of the upper storey (plate 7 b).ng These sun-dried unbaked bricks, which are visible in the published photograph for this room, rise up to the same height as the s pillar and look more like a wall, two bricks thick. The mudbricks have long since collapsed, but a single course rubble wall stands in place (plate 15 d). Immediately to the s, half buried in the debris over the earth floor surface, which has in patches a distinctive red colour, are fragments of disintegrated terracotta-coloured mudbrick. Evans surely misinterpreted an actual mud-brick wall as a pile waiting to be used in some restoration work on the upper floor. This mudbrick construction dates to LM I II A. Stored in Room 17 is a pale orange, burned and complete mudbrick: its dimensions are 45 cm x 34 x 12 (it is not in situ).120 The mud was tempered with vegetal matter. Its original provenance is unknown (plate 5 b). In light of the above evidence, it seems that mudbricks were used mainly for the upper floor walls, especially since they created a lighter structure. It remains unclear whether the mudbrick wall added to Room 36 was built to support the ceiling or mainly to alter the use of the space available in the room. Unlike the LP, mudbricks were not used for the construction of the MUM. Whether the use of mudbrick on the upper floor of the LP can be associated with the LM IIIAi re-building activities remains an attractive hypothesis. LIME AND CLAY PLASTER Even though Mackenzie in the 1 905 notebook regularly referred to the 'plaster and brick materials of room partitions', which once burned assumed a red colour, he never reported lime or mud/clay plaster found in situ.121 No distinction between lime and mud-plaster was made for the numerous blocking walls, which were always described as simply walls 'of rubble masonry and plaster'.122 Minoan lime-plaster, as Heaton's studies have demonstrated, was made out of burned calcium carbonate in some form.123 This material apart from its employment for frescoes was used to seal exterior joints of ashlar walls, for covering lower and upper floors, in strips between gypsum floor slabs and as the final coat in covering those rubble walls, which were not faced with gypsum. At the N end of the LP W Facade, between the ashlar blocks of the third and fourth course, lime- plaster together with pebbles and schist flakes was used as filling material for cracks and spaces between the limestone blocks (plan 28). Furthermore, lime-plaster was applied between the blocks, sealing off the exterior joints.124 Careful cleaning of the building's floors has revealed patches of what might be lime-plaster flooring in Rooms 12, 15, 16, 21, 20, and 23. This white and hard material discovered is obviously not the bedrock, since kouskouras, which is also observed in parts of the building, has a distinctive yellow colour. No evidence for lime-plaster applied on the walls remains in situ, although in certain rooms a final coat of this material probably covered the mud-plaster. In Room 17, where mud-plaster still remains in situ, no lime coating survives (plate 8 b). In the P. I. boxes small fragments of plaster, painted red, blue or yellow, were collected. The fresco fragments which have been assigned to the LP are very fragmentary. Clay or mud-plaster was generously used in a variety of ways within the building. Clay, mixed with small stones, sherds and vegetable matter, was used a mortar to bond together rubble and limestone blocks of the LP walls. It can still be observed in sections of certain walls, where the gaps between the rubble constructions have not been filled in with cement. Furthermore, rubble walls, before they were coated with a fine layer of lime-plaster, were covered with a base of mud-plaster. Small patches of mud- plaster, mixed with vegetal matter and sherds, remain still in situ on certain LP walls. These patches of mud-plaster have survived due to the fire, which baked them brick-hard and gave them a deep red colour. Such examples were preserved in the better-protected n walls of Rooms 20, 14, 29 and 12. When the building was excavated, the mud-plaster covering the rubble walls must have been found well preserved, especially in areas subjected to a fire destruction. Evans reported that the walls of Room 14 had preserved 'a good deal of the coarser backing of a fresco surface adhering to them', by 118 Evans 1904-5, 5 fig. 2. 119 AE/NB 1908, 8b; Evans 1914, 74 and fig. 83. 12(1 Both examples of mudbrick are reported by Shaw 1971, 233. 121 DM/DB 2.V.05, 64.

Many rubble walls, when excavated, probably looked very similar to the well-preserved MUM walls in Rooms M, N, O, P and Q. Room 17, because it was roofed soon after its discovery, still preserves ample evidence of the use of mud-plaster in rubble and limestone block walls. At the sw corner of the room, above the level of the gypsum balustrade, part of the mud-plaster coating, 10 cm thick, is still in situ (plate 5 b, plan 37). In the fire destruction it turned red and black in patches. The intensity of the conflagration that caused the burning of the mud-plaster also coloured black those limestone blocks of the s wall set behind the preserved plaster. More patches of less well-baked mud-plaster can be observed on the N and w walls of the same room. Near the nw corner, mixed with the mud-plaster is a fresco fragment still in situ (plate 140, plan 39). However this white lime-plaster fragment with a red flower on it was incorporated in the mixture of the mud-plaster in a similar way to sherds. As for the blocking wall on the Room's e balustrade that preserved the fluted column impressions, it was faced with a mixture of mud-plaster, sherds and vegetal matter, which has acquired a light terracotta colour. Mud/clay plaster was used between the gypsum dado slabs and the rubble wall in both Rooms 1 7 and 1 2 in order to help hold the first in position. FRESCOES In his 1 908 notebook, Evans sketched two fresco fragments, one depicting a spiral painted in white, black and red, the other a papyrus that he compared to the papyrus design in relief, on the Royal Villa Palace Style jar.126 Both pieces were reported as found in Corridor 13. In PM Evans elaborated on his earlier notes, by reporting that the walls of Room 14 'still show a good deal of the coarser backing of a fresco surface adhering to them'; whereas the papyrus fragments were considered inferior in design and associated with the Re-occupation period.127 His remarks regarding the fragmentary nature of all fresco pieces found in the LP is reflected by the small number of stray fragments kept in the P. I. boxes.128 These have been discussed in detail by Cameron who identified a dress design or miniature fish (P. 1. 15), a 'Genius' (P. I. 2) and an architectural fragment (P. I. 4) amongst the plain white, red and blue monochrome fresco fragments.129 Unfortunately the fresco pieces discussed by Evans are missing. Cameron noted that several pieces are consistent with LM II-IIIAi styles of painting from the Palace, whereas the earliest date to MM IIIB/LM IA.130 None of the fresco material was dated later than LM IIIAi. FIREPLACES Two fireplaces/hearths were reported in the notebooks. The first is in Room 8: 'In the NW corner of this room the re-occupiers had arranged an erection like a fire-place with a recess below like that for ashes...'131 In the S Court Evans found 'a hearth in the corner'.132 The shape and position of the former hearth was included in Doll's inked plan of Room 1 7 (plan 22). It was set in the nw corner of the room, abutting the gypsum dado of the w wall and the blocked doorway in the n; it had its open side to the s. The hearth was removed, so there is no information regarding its construction, although it recalls the fireplace in the Pillar Hall of the MUM, which was set against a low retaining wall and built of mud on a rubble foundation. A terminus ad quern for its construction is LM IIIAi, if contemporary with the blocking up of the doorways along the N Sector. INCISED SIGNS Evans, who was particularly interested in mason's marks, took notes in 1922 on such signs as were visible on the ashlar blocks.133 Today more than fifty incised signs are visible on the walls, all carved on the limestone ashlar blocks (plans 27-8, 31, 44-5). 134 Mason's marks have been interpreted in a variety of ways. Some are purely secular: such as marks for positioning blocks during the construction 123 PM IL fS24- 12tt PM II, 401 fig. 231, for photo of Royal Villa Palace Style iar. 127 PMll, 524 andn. 3. 128 Cameron reported fragments in P.

When found in 'religious areas' they have been thought to enhance the sanctity of a room, or taken as a religious symbol. The signs still visible on the LP walls fall into two different categories: mason's marks of the Old Palace date, such as 'Tridents' and 'Etas', carved on blocks which are obviously now in secondary use. These originally must have belonged to an earlier building nearby, which at the time when the LP was constructed had become a quarry. Nevertheless, most signs visible on the walls, such as the more frequent Branches and the occasional Windows, Eta, Double Axe and Zeta can be ascribed to a Neo- palatial date and so associated with the construction of the LP. A note should be added on mason's marks in the LP Pillar Rooms, since both features have been clearly associated, in other buildings, with religious practices. On the pillars of Room 36 Evans recorded a number of Branch signs on each block, some of which are no longer traceable. In contrast, the single preserved pillar in the Basement Room 3 has no mason's marks. SYNTHESIS: THE ARCHITECTURAL PHASES OF THE LITTLE PALACE (plan 50) The definition of the LP's architectural phases is based on the combined study of the architecture, building materials and construction techniques, described above, in close association with the examination of walls and pottery retrieved from their make-up, based on 1995 restoration of the LP and MUM (see Appendix). Phase o: Before the Little Palace From the architectural remains presently visible on site it becomes apparent that almost all traces of earlier structures were demolished when the site was levelled for the LP. A few walls marked on Doll's plan as 'foundations' were preserved at about the level of the LP ground floor. These bear no relationship to the present building. Such walls are the two running n-s and E-w in the area of the SE Court and the wall running N-s that crosses the middle of Room 22. Finally, the pre-LP rubble walls in Room 16, which ran partially under the s and w walls, form a corner at the sw end of this room. They are associated with a MM IIIA deposit (fig. 3.4: 8-12). The area explored during the 1995 23rd Ephorate restoration was too small to determine the nature of the material, i.e. destruction, abandonment or fill. Other architectural features could also belong to earlier structures, but from their present state it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions. Such features are the peculiarly shaped wall running E-w through the NW Court, and the E half of the foundation course along the projecting section of the N Facade (plan 14). The s face of the former wall, maintains the same E-w orientation as that of the Early Facade, implying that a N-s / e-w orientation pre-existed and was maintained for the LP. Evans, in PM, suggested that 'there is some evidence of the incorporation in the new work of elements taken over from a pre-existing edifice, going back at least as far as the beginning of the last Middle Minoan Period'.135 The masonry of Room 8 w wall (plate 1 ¿), which was incorrectly described as 'the panelled arrangement of courses in ashlar masonry set within upright posts' and compared to the Hall of the Double Axes, was taken for an earlier feature. Similarly the S and E Facades, because of their gypsum orthostates, were interpreted as parts of an earlier building assimilated in the LP. There is, however, nothing in the construction of either Room 8 or the S Facade indicating that originally these two formed part of an earlier building. Nonetheless, the Early Facade does differ from all other exterior walls in that it had a two-coursed, stepped and recessed limestone foundation course, set at a lower level than the foundations of the E and S Facades (plates 4 0, 7 a). This stepped foundation course was partially, if not completely, covered when the so-called Causeway was constructed. Even though the surviving remains of the Causeway stretched for less than two metres and did not align with the LP entrance, Evans was misled by its course and took it for a short path connecting the Basement to Room 36. The difference in construction, level and alignment, suggests that originally both the Early Facade and Causeway were part of an earlier structure, presumably an Old Palace or early Neo-palatial period building. The existence of such a building would explain the large amount of re-used limestone and gypsum blocks found incorporated within the LP. Some of these are not only badly damaged and weathered but also bear mason's marks of the Old Palace period. For some reason, the Causeway and Early Facade were deliberately kept and amalgamated into the new building. When the LP was constructed special care was taken in accommodating both 135 PM 11, 514.</page><page sequence="85">74 THE ARCHITECTURE these old features into the new building, by creating a small court with its pavement arranged so as to include the preserved section of the Causeway (plates 4 &lt;z, 7 a' plans 18-19). Since both the present and previous building were set on the slope of the hill, the inclining face of the natural rock had to be trimmed to contain them. Large parts of the LP were probably set directly on bedrock, after this had been levelled out. A good indication of the amount of bedrock, which had to be removed is the NEP, basically a trimmed portion of kouskouras supported by a retaining wall (plates 8 ¿z, 10 a, 12 b). The considerable effort taken in levelling surfaces for the building can be envisaged from the evidence for 'ancient cuttings' traced by Mackenzie behind the terrace walls of the Basement. Phase 1: Construction of the Little Palace in MM IIIB/LM IA Although the LP has a rather irregular shape, its ground floor layout probably belongs to a single architectural phase. The exact position and orientation of the building was no doubt determined by various factors, such as the size and form of the available land, and the site's relationship to structures already existing in the immediate neighbourhood. The course of the Early Facade indicates that the same orientation was deliberately maintained for the new building. The LP was founded on three different levels, the lowest being the Basement at 3 m below the ground floor of the rest of the structure (plate 4). Rooms 6a, 6b and the E half of Corridor 33 were set at a second level, which is only 20 cm lower than the rest of the ground floor. This slight difference in levels was probably intentional, designed to help align the level of the Basement's upper floor with the rest of the building. Another possibility is that this difference in floor heights was an element surviving from the previous building on the site. All the remaining parts of the ground floor were set at roughly the same level. The slightly raised floor levels, observed within some ground floor rooms along the w half of the building, should probably be related to the course taken by the natural rock. Extensive soundings would be required in order to confirm the original layout of the ground floor. Nevertheless, the building's main components - e.g. its main entrance, the Storage Rooms (Rooms 28-30), the Light Well (Room 31) and Staircases in the Central Sector (Staircases 32 and 34), the Basement (Rooms 1-5) and Minoan Halls at the E and SE, the Lustral Basin (Room 17) with its sunken floor, and the group of small rectangular rooms in the N Sector - probably belong to a single concept and design. On the exterior, the NEP (plate 1 2 b) and W Facade created space for a paved passage in between, which helped to accommodate the flow of rain water through the N Drain (plate 12 0), which at the same time served the NW Room and the Lavatory (Rooms 14 and 11). The original arrangement along the E Front remains unknown, as does the space w of the LP and s of the NEP before the MUM was founded. The foundation of the building was dated 'to the great Restoration after the Earthquake that overthrew the earlier MM III Palace'. Evans reached this conclusion on account of 'the character of the structure', but also because of 'its ceramic association'. It was probably during the 1905-10 excavation seasons 'that a series of sherds extracted from the clay mortar in the interstices of the interior walls proved to belong entirely to the Middle Minoan Class, none of them, so far as could be judged, being later than the date of the Repositories. The bulk of these must be referred to the usual MM IIIB seismic stratum.'136 Evans's dating was most probably based on the evidence provided by the pottery collected from Staircase 32. The results of the 23rd Ephoreia restoration do not contradict such a dating, since a series of walls produced MM IIIB/LM IA pottery.137 Phase 2: Construction of the Minoan Unexplored Mansion in MM IIIB/LM IA The construction of the MUM in MM IIIB/LM IA provides a terminus ante quern for the foundation of the LP. Its construction initiated a series of architectural modifications to the exterior of the LP. There is no doubt that this smaller building was an afterthought and not part of the original LP plan, since it had a different orientation and appearance.138 The initial idea was for both buildings to be closely related, this being best demonstrated by the Bridge, which not only connected the two, but also served as one of the main entrances to the MUM. The exact position of the Bridge is by no means accidental, since access to the new building could be achieved though the LP entrance at the s, 13tì /WII, 514. 137 Room 2 1 : w and s walls; Room 23: E wall and Room 26: n wall. 138 MUM, 261.</page><page sequence="86">THE ARCHITECTURE 75 up Staircase 34 and finally through the room located above Room 30. On the outside, the gap between the two buildings was spanned by a Bridge supported on two buttresses, set parallel to each other, and a projecting wall positioned close to the LP (plate 8 a). The orientation of the Bridge differed from that of either building in order to minimise the difference in angle between the two. Further modifications were no doubt carried out on the upper floor of the LP, where a doorway must have been opened in the exterior wall. After the Bridge walls were constructed, the S Court was arranged in its present form, by paving the small court and providing the space between the two buttresses with a shallow channel for the disposal of rainwater. It remains unclear whether the drain marked on plan 1 7 just outside the sw corner of the LP was constructed at the time when the S Court was arranged, or whether it belongs to Phase 1 . The unclear format of Space R suggests that it never acquired its final form. Undoubtedly the intention was to provide adequate accommodation for the flow of rainwater and fluids disposed of from the MUM Room H, through a drain and subsequently a channel, which passed under the Bridge. Finally, the wall running n-s between the NEP and the N Storage Room Facade (plate 8 a) could have been built during either Phase 1 or Phase 2, when Space R was defined but left incomplete. Phase 3: Modifications and Re-building: The Effects of the Thera Eruption and the Preceding Earthquake in LM IA Evidence for damage and repairs in LM I A come from Room 29 and Corridor 13. The w half of Room 29 N wall was re-built, starting from its first course, in a fashion similar to its original E half (plan 42). The latest pottery that was found in the rubble make-up of Corridor 13 E wall dates to LM I A (fig. 3.3: 24-25), implying a complete re-build or extensive repairs to this wall. Both repairs imply substantial damage to the ground floor walls not to mention the upper floor sections. It is tempting to associate these two repairs with structural damage caused by the earthquake which preceded the eruption of the Thera volcano. 139 One particular alteration to the form and most certainly function of Room 1 7 could be associated chronologically with the above-mentioned events. At a certain time, the lustral basin in Room 1 7 was filled in and the floor was raised up to the level of the floor in the adjacent Room 12. Evidence for this alteration is provided by the discoloration of the gypsum pier, positioned off the E end of the N balustrade in Room 17. The distinct line can also be traced along the limestone masonry of the s balustrade and the w wall at the same absolute height as the discoloration of the N balustrade (plans 40, 37-9). By raising the floor and covering the lustral basin and its descending gypsum steps, the original use of the room was radically altered. Although no pottery can be securely associated with the fill, a terminus ante quem for this event might be LM IA, a date when other lustral basins in Crete were filled up.140 It has been argued that the filling in of lustral basins is, at least chronologically, related to the Thera eruption. Phase 4: Between LM II and LM IIIAi The 1995 23rd Ephorate restoration work has produced evidence for construction and repair of several walls along the N Sector of the LP with a terminus ante quern of LM II and LM IIIAi. Since pottery of an LM IIIA1/2 date was found within the same rooms all these building activities must have taken place prior to the event which left such deposits within the N Sector. The two course and recessed rubble wall set up against the SW Facade was constructed as a means to protect the LP Facade from the rain water flowing through the S Court. The sherds collected from the rubble make-up give an LM II terminus ad quern for its construction (fig. 3.3: 1-7). If the wall was constructed during this period, it would imply that this section of the LP was also refurbished at a time when the MUM was re-occupied. The elevation of the W Facade clearly shows that a large section of it is a re-build (plan 28). LM II sherds, collected from the rubble packing from the section of the W Facade, which corresponds to Room 16, provide a terminus ad quern for what must have been a substantial repair (fig. 3.4: 1-7,8-12). Pottery dating to LM IIIAi has been collected from a variety of LP 'original-looking' walls or rubble additions, located along the N Sector.

The support wall abutting the s wall of Room 1 1 , which was founded directly upon the paved floor, contained in its make-up LM IIIAi pottery (fig. 3.3: 1 1-12). In addition, there is a series of architectural modifications, the contemporaneity of which remains hypothetical, since no pottery has been securely associated with them. They share, however, one common characteristic with the rubble wall of Room 1 1 , in that all were constructed when the original earthen or paved floors where in use. These are the following: the support wall added to Room 27, the wall dividing Room 5a and 5b but also the rubble wall, running w-E, built up against the E face of Room 3 s pillar. It is tempting to associate chronologically all the above modifications on the basis of their compatible functions. All walls could have provided additional support either to the ground floor wall they were built up against or to the ceiling and upper floor. Nevertheless, they illustrate the need to hold up different interior walls of the LR The two rubble walls built up against the pillars in Room 36 share one common characteristic with the above-mentioned alterations, namely that they were constructed at a time when the original floor was still in use (plate 15 d, plan 36). From their present condition, it is difficult to understand whether they could have provided additional support to the pillars or whether they were related more to the use of the ground floor space. Since both were set at the same level as the pillar bases, they were constructed prior to the LM IIIA1/2 fire in Room 36 and the subsequent clean-up and re-use associated with the construction of wall C, a rubble foundation to support a mudbrick wall. Sherds collected from the unexcavated fill of the raised floor for Room 14, suggest that this modification happened sometime in LM III. If to be associated with LM IIIAi it would imply that not only the elegant gypsum staircase arrangement, but also the blocking of the drain opening from Room 14 into the W Facade were also contemporary events. The blocking of the drain must have happened at a time when the floor level in the Paved Passage had not risen considerably, since the drain is level with the Facade's first course. The construction of the E-w wall, which closed the Paved Passage, is also associated with LM IIIAi pottery (fig. 3.3: 8-10). Originally the N Drain disposed both of the rainwater coming through the Paved Passage, and the liquids running out from the drains within Rooms 1 1 and 14. With the blocking up of the drain in Room 1 4 and the construction of the E-w wall, which closed the Paved Passage, the amount of liquid flowing through the drain must have decreased. Unfortunately from the photographs it is not clear whether this wall went down to the level of the pavement or whether the closed space created became an indoor feature. Phase 5: Alterations in LM IIIA: Blocking up the Doorways and Balustrades in the North and East Sectors At the time when the LP was wrecked by the fire destruction which baked the clay sealings and caused the collapse of the upper floor, much of the original layout of the ground floor in the N and E Sectors had been already considerably altered. With these modifications the use of the rooms in question was changed, as well as circulation and lighting. These alterations are shown on plan 50. All intercommunicating doorways between Rooms 9, 8 and 7 were blocked. The three northern doorways along the E wall of Room g and both doorways of Corridor 18 were also found closed up. The E balustrade of Room 17, and all doorways of Room 19, apart from the s doorway in the E wall, had been filled in as well (plate 5 a). Furthermore a hearth had been constructed in the nw corner of Room 8 (plan 22). Much information on these architectural changes derives from the DM/DB descriptions, since almost all modifications to the original plan had been removed by 1910 (plate 2 a). When Doll made his plan in that year, only two of the numerous blockings were still in situ: the partition wall blocking the e balustrade of Room 1 7 and that in the s doorway of Corridor 1 8 (plan 17). Photographs taken before the rooms were restored by Evans to their original form record the appearance of three more blocked doorways, namely that in the E wall of Room 19 and the two western blocked doorways in the set linking Rooms 7 and 8 (plates 2 ¿z, 5 a). These photographs together with the preserved blockings are the basic sources for assessing why the layout of the ground floor was so drastically altered. Two explanations are likely to prevail: i) the use of certain ground-floor rooms had changed which then required certain structural alterations; ii) it was necessary to support ceilings and alter parts of the upper floor, requiring reinforcements to the construction below. The latter set pre-supposes damage, decay or change of function on the upper floor, whereas the former does not necessarily have to be associated with purely structural problems within their specific part of the building. All available evidence suggests that these modifications were well constructed. In DM/DB, they were described as walls 'of rubble masonry and plaster' or 'rubble and plaster partitions' or simply</page><page sequence="88">THE ARCHITECTURE 77 'plaster partitions', which indicates that the materials used in their construction were quite similar. The main difference lay in their thickness and hence robustness since some were described as 'thin plaster partitions', occupying less than half the length of the doorjambs, in comparison with others that probably covered almost the entire width of the thresholds. For example the partition walls in the E balustrade, the s doorway to Corridor 18, the blocked doorways in the E wall of Room 9 and those of the doorways between Rooms 9 and 8 were thin, occupying only about half the width of the doorjambs and one third of the gypsum balustrade. Typical is that description of the partitions closing the doorways between Rooms 9 and 8, where Mackenzie reported that 'the wall was so thin as to be hardly more than a rubble and plaster partition'.141 This is especially true for the preserved partition wall along the E balustrade of Room 1 7 constructed out of rubble heavily packed with mud-plaster (plan 40). Such a wall would not have offered any additional support for the ceiling or upper floor, but obviously changed the lighting and appearance of the room. All other blockings were rather thicker, since they seem to have filled in the entire space of the thresholds.142 The two partition walls still preserved, together with those visible in plates 2 a and 5 a share one common characteristic: they all were founded directly on the paved floors. Similarly, the partition wall above the e balustrade of Room 17 was set directly on the gypsum ledge. Moreover, at the time these blockings were constructed, the original woodwork elements were still standing. These were incorporated into the alterations as can be observed from the impressions left in the mud-plaster partitions. When Mackenzie referred to the blockings along the doorways between Rooms 9-8 he noted that 'the carbonised wood of the door-posts came to be much better preserved than they would have been without the protection and support offered by the partition'.143 In summary, the following can be noted: the doorways were blocked with rubble and mud-plaster; some, if not all, were given a smooth clay plaster surface. Although these blockings vary in thickness, their main purpose was to alter the layout on the ground floor rather than offer substantial support for the ceiling and upper floor. These last remained in use until the fire destruction which caused their collapse. This is especially true for partition walls such as that above the E balustrade of Room 17 and those which blocked the doorways between Rooms 9 and 8. None was strong enough to provide support for the ceiling, a task still performed by the wooden columns and the doorposts. All partition walls for which there is evidence, either preserved or on photographs, seem to have been set directly on the paved floors. Finally, at the time when these alterations were carried out, the wooden columns and doorposts, at least in this part of the building, were still standing and functioning in the ground- floor rubble constructions, helping to transfer the weight from the upper floor. Thus, from the preserved architectural remains in conjunction with the records of the excavation, there is no evidence to suggest that these extensive alterations came as a result of a fire destruction in this part of the building. The sherds collected from the partition wall of the e balustrade in Room 17 date to LM IIIAi (fig. 3.4: 13-15). The blocking up of the doorways in the N Sector must be a contemporary event which happened shortly after the LM IIIAi re-building activities of Phase 4. What remains to be answered is why these modifications took place and, above all, when did the N Sector suffer from the fire destruction which caused the collapse of the first floor and baked the clay sealings. To this matter I will return later after evidence from the surviving pottery and small finds has been presented. Phase 6a: Repairs and Re-use of the Magazines in LM IIIA2 or Later At a certain time in their history Rooms 29 and 30 were extensively repaired. The bench-like feature along the s wall of Room 29 was eliminated, since it was used as the foundation course for a rubble wall (plan 49). A similar rubble wall was constructed against the s wall of Room 30. Sherds collected from the rubble make-up of both walls date to LM IIIA2 (figs. 3.6-3.7: 1-8). However, one particular rim fragment collected from the earthen gap between the original s wall of Room 30 and the rubble addition could date to LM IIIB (fig. 3.7: 8). Another modification in the SW Sector is the mudbrick wall in Room 36, which was set on a rubble foundation (plate 7 ¿, plan 36). The wall was constructed at a time when the floor level had risen slightly and was partly covering the gypsum pillar bases. The pottery collected from under the rubble foundation course generally dates to LM IIIAi with one possible LM IIIA2 early rim fragment. 141 DM/DB 2q.iv.0rs, 60. 142 Especially the doorways between Rooms 7 and 8, the n doorway to Corridor 18 and the n doorway leading from Room 7 to Room 19. 143 DM/DB 29.iv.05, 60.</page><page sequence="89">78 THE ARCHITECTURE Phase 6b: A Post-LP Phase The fire destruction which brought an end to Phase 5 must have left the building with most parts of the ground floor choked with debris from the collapsed floors. Judging from the building's present state, many upper floor walls must have still stood at a reasonable height after the fire destruction. The two upper courses of the n wall in Room 1 2 belong to a phase which must post-date the fire destruction (plate 12 a, plans 33-4, 47). Here the two surviving courses were built of re-used limestone blocks and were set on top of the heavily burned mud-plaster and rubble remains of the original wall. Here, it should be noted that the wooden beam positioned on the gypsum pier at the n end of the wall was ignored when these upper courses were constructed, since limestone blocks were positioned above it. It becomes apparent that when these two courses were built, the N wall of Room 1 2 and the rubble support wall located along the s wall of Room 1 1 were levelled out. To this wall two more features can be added, which from their descriptions appear different from all other modifications in the area of the N and E Sectors. The 'solid wall'144 crossing Room 9 and the 'massive wall' which blocked Corridor 13 and Room 14145 could have been part of a single architectural feature, perhaps a dog-leg, constructed after the building had fallen into ruins. However the date and use of this wall remains unknown. Other Alterations (not datable) The following modifications have been observed along the interior and exterior of the building, for which there is very fragmentary information. Some have been identified only from plans and photographs, while others were only briefly mentioned in the notebooks. Consequently, it becomes difficult to assign any dates other than the most tentative. The entrance to the Magazines (Rooms 28-30) seems to have been found blocked (plate 7 ã). If associated with Phase 6 it could mean one of the following: the Magazines could be approached only from the upper floor; or that this alteration belongs to a phase post-dating the re-occupation of the Magazine rooms known from the construction of additional walls in Rooms 29 and 30 (plate 13 b). The main entrance to the LP was also found blocked up, starting from the level of the threshold. It is unfortunate that more detailed dating evidence for these two modifications is lacking; however, signs for the re-use of the SW and Central Sectors after LM IIIAi might offer a potential date during Phases 4-6. Even more problematic is the dating of the fireplace set in the S Court, which was briefly reported by Evans. Its existence raises the question of whether this open-air court was roofed when the fireplace was in use. Whether it was contemporary with the LM II hearth in the MUM Pillar Hall, or the LM IIIB one in Room D remains unclear, since there is no information on the hearth's exact position, its level or any associated pottery. Taking into consideration the use of the LP/MUM after LM II, an LM IIIB date for this hearth seems more possible. APPENDIX: THE 1995 LP AND MUM CONSERVATION INTRODUCTION In May and June 1995 the 23rd Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities conducted extensive restoration work in the LP and MUM under the direction of A. Karetsou and N. Demopoulou.146 The project's aim was to consolidate walls in immediate need of repair. Evans's and Platon's routine of covering the earthen gaps with cement offered only temporary protection, as the earth behind the thin film of concrete tends to expand when moistened through rain, cracking the cement coating. The 1 995 conservation involved the removal of the cement applied by Evans or Platon in the LP and by Popham in the MUM. The original earth which was used as bonding material for the rubble walls was exposed and subsequently removed to a depth of c. 5-10 cm. Cement was again used as consolidating material, whereas a final coating of crushed sherds, locally called xouQaoávi, was applied in order to conceal the dark-grey coloured concrete. 144 DM/DB 29.iv.05, 61. 145 DM/DB 1 7. vi.08, 82. 14tì I am most grateful for their invitation to supervise the restoration work at the LP and MUM and for permission to publish the material collected. Invaluable was the expertise of the technicians Nikos Daskalakis and Andreas Klinis, who where in charge of the 23rd Ephoreia workmen.</page><page sequence="90">THE ARCHITECTURE 79 The earth used as bonding material contained small quantities of broken bones but most importantly fragmentary pottery.147 The latter should provide dating evidence for the construction or repair of the wall in question; a unique opportunity for collecting dating evidence for the LP. But how reliable is such a source of information? After the removal of the cement coating, floors were carefully swept eliminating the chances of contamination from pottery which might have accumulated on the earthen surfaces.148 Stray sherds could have crept in, especially in walls, which have vertical beam slots embedded in their construction. Whether such a process took place in antiquity, during Evans's excavation, or later restoration remains unclear. Furthermore, there is the question regarding the type of restoration each wall underwent in antiquity, ranging from a substantial re-build to a partial repair. For example in the LP the N wall of Room 29 was extensively repaired since its w half was re-built down to its first course. Here the Minoan restoration is easily distinguished due to the more careless masonry in the re-built section. But for rubble walls, using small to medium size stones, repairs could have left few traces. Contemporary pottery in some quantity represents, unless stated otherwise, a terminus ad quern for either the construction or extensive repair of the wall under discussion. THE MINOAN UNEXPLORED MANSION The results of the 23rd Ephoreia 1995 conservation work at the MUM are presented here as a 'case study' in order to test the validity of information collected from the make-up of Minoan walls (figs. 3.1-3.2). Here there is available what is lacking from the LP, namely detailed data on the stratigraphy of the building. To anticipate the restoration results, the sherds collected not only matched the history of the MUM, but made perfect sense when combined with the stratigraphy of each area in question. The North Facade CLEANING BENEATH THE RUBBLE SECTION OF THE FACADE (FIG. 3.1: I4-23) In the process of consolidating the Mansion's N Facade much attention was given to the mid section of the wall, where the original ashlar block had been replaced by two smaller blocks, which rested on a rough rubble course, set upon the limestone krepidoma of the N Facade.149 Popham reported that part of this construction had spilled into the N Corridor. During restoration it became obvious that this re-built section of the Facade, as seen from within Room C, was founded on a c. 10 cm buff earthen layer. More specifically, the two larger blocks were set directly on the earthen layer, which was sealed off from the exterior by the rubble visible above the Facade's foundation course. The buff earthen layer proved to contain relatively large quantities of pottery. Apart from the scrappy MM IIIB/LM IA and LM II pottery, the bulk of the material collected dates to LM IIIA2 and LM IIIB early thus providing a terminus ad quern for the repair of the Facade. Amongst the most interesting shapes is a 50% complete plain spouted cup, in a whitish-buff fine fabric (MUM95/1) (fig. 3.1: 23). Its profile resembles LM IIIB type kylikes, whereas its pouring spout and raised handle are common features.150 Amongst the LM IIÍA2 material is the stem and lower body of a champagne cup (MUM95/33) and a LM IIIB deep bowl with four thin body bands (MUM95/5) decorated with hatched triangles (fig. 3.1: 19-20).151 Other datable and illustrated pieces include two LM II type decorated sherds (MUM95/34 and MUM95/35) (fig. 3.1: 14-1 5);152 a LM IIIA shallow bowl with a horizontal strap handle (MUM95/2) (fig. 3.1: 21), an LM IIIA2 early type champagne cup (MUM95/ 3) (fig. 3.1: 16) and a LM IIIA2 late (or LM IIIB) fine plain shallow bowl (MUM95/32) (fig. 3.1: 22). Kylix stems are of LM IIIA types. 147 The use of earth mixed with sherds, bones, and straw or other vegetable matter is common; Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki 1997, 140. 148 In several instances it was possible to date precisely feature sherds as these were retrieved from the wall make-up. 149 For a description of the N Facade, plus photographs, elevations and plans see MUM, 102, 8-9, pls. 4 b, 10a, 22 c-d. 150 Best parallels from Knossos come from the LM IIIB deposit of plain vessels from the Room s of the Shrine of the Double Axes in the Palace: Popham 19700, 1 10 fig. 16. The Palace ladles have a similar profile to the MUM example, but a rather smaller rim diameter. 131 Warren has recently argued that both types of underside, i.e. the open type and the one with a separately defined hole co- exist in LM IIIA2: Warren 1997, 179-80. Decorated deep bowls with an S-profile also occur in LM IIIA2: Warren 1997, 179; the four thin body bands are a LM IIIA feature, whereas the decoration of our MUM example occurs also in LM IIIB: Popham 1070k io8 fig. 2 and 200 fie. a. 152 MUM, pl. 167-8.</page><page sequence="91">8o THE ARCHITECTURE Fig. 3.1.

Conclusions The regular presence of MM IIIB/LM IA pottery amongst the sherds collected from the MUM walls is not accidental, since it agrees with the suggested construction date of the building during this period or at an early stage of LM IA.174 The absence of LM IB deposits confirms to the archaeological evidence for a complete abandonment of the building during this period.

The earthquake prior to the Thera eruption may have caused structural damage to the building. Its abandonment could reflect the heavy workload which the Knossos masons had throughout the town as a result of the LM I A earthquake. The discovery of LM II pottery in the wall make-up is not accidental, as the MUM was patched up and fully occupied for the first time during this ceramic phase. In LM II, it suffered from a minor fire destruction, after which various modifications took place including the blocking up of Corridor L. The absence of any later sherds from the building's S Sector agrees with the sequence of events here, since after the wholesale final LM II fire destruction this part of the MUM was never re-occupied. On the other hand, the walls along the N Sector, an area that continued to be occupied for over 1 00 years, produced more advanced pottery. The w end of Corridor E was sealed off in LM IIIA2 so it is not accidental that the latest sherds collected from the wall make-up date to LM IIIAi. The latest pottery retrieved from the MUM walls dates to LM IIIA2. It derives from Rooms A, B, C and D, which continued to be occupied until the building was finally abandoned some time in LM IIIB. Furthermore, the evidence for fire, either in the form of discoloured mud-plaster or stones, comes exclusively from the S Sector, yet again confirming the stratigraphical history of the site as defined by Popham. In table 3.1, the MUM walls are listed according to the ceramic date provided by the latest sherds found amongst the wall make-up material. References are also made to the colour the soil used as bonding agent for the rubble. Buff implies unburned, whereas red-terracotta, a discoloration of the buff soil caused by fire. Table 3.1.

Pottery ranges from MM IIIB/LM IA to LM IIIAi. LP95/P132 and LP95/ Pi 33 are LM IIIAi type cups/kylikes since both have a short and tight ledge rim rather than the more flaring LM II version (fig. 3.3: 8-9). 175 LP95/P134 with its alternating arcs dates to LM IIIA (fig. 3.3: io).176 A terminus ad quem for the foundation of this wall is LM IIIAi. THE SOUTH WEST FACADE (FIG. 3.3: I-7, PLAN 30) Stepped two course wall abutting SW Facade (Zembil #58) The N half of this two course and stepped rubble wall abuts the SW Facade and is founded directly on the S Court paving. Sherds were collected from the make-up of the upper course of the rubble wall and from the space between it and the SW Facade. No traces of burning were noticed in the soil. The material collected is scrappy dating generally to MM IIIB/LM IA, such as the two monochrome cup fragments in a matt brown red paint (LP95/P128 and LP95/P129) (fig. 3.3: 2 and 4).177 The conical cup LP95/P127 is of the general LM I type (fig. 3.3: 1). A more advanced dating is provided by the rim fragments of a one handled cup (LP95/P131) decorated in the Knossian Jackson Pollock' Style of LM IB (fig. 3.3: 3).178 A LM II terminus ante quem for the foundation of this wall provided by the body fragment of a cup with a LM II type reed motif. Interior Walls room 1 1 (zembil #68) South Wall (fig. 3.3: 11-12, plan 33) The central section of the 'support' rubble wall, which abuts the original s wall of Room 1 1 and is founded directly on the ironstone paving, was conserved. The earth, obviously burned, had a rich terracotta red colour. The pottery collected is scrappy but dates clearly range from MM to LM IIIAi but not later. LP95/P140 with its rather stylised floral motif and monochrome interior resembles LM IIIAi rather than LM II examples (fig. 3.3: 11).179 LP95/P141 could be either a LM IIIAi kylix or cup (fig. 3.3: 2).180 A terminus ad quem for the foundation of this wall is LM IIIAi. ROOM 12 North Wall (Zembil #48) (plan 34) Sherds were collected from the wall's upper courses along the ne corner but under the ashlar blocks visible in plan 34 and above the heavily burned and vitrified mud and plaster. Soil was pale buff, not burned. Material was very scrappy and not worth drawing or cataloguing; pottery dates vary from MM, LM I with one LM II or LM IIIAi type sherd in fine 'green fabric'.181 Three LM I type sherds came out of the middle section of the wall's lower rubble courses (Zembil #79). A terminus ad quem for the foundation of the upper course is LM IIIAi; whereas for the lower courses LM I. 175 Compare Popham 1970a, 103 fig. g for plain LM IIIAi pottery from the House of the High Priest; MUM, pl. 1 76.4 and 8 for MUM examples with MUM, pl. 160 for LM II types. 176 Popham 1970a, 105 fig. 11.14 from the Royal Villa; Popham 1970a, 109 fig. 15.112 and pl. 20 c. ]" For examples of monochrome bowls see Deposit B from the Acropolis Houses, Knossos: Catling et al 1979, 26 fig. 18.99. Deposit B has been dated to MM IIIA by Catling et al. 1979, 67; Warren and Hankey 1989, 57; Hood 1996, 12. The shape seems to continue into the following ceramic phase of MM IIIB = MM III/LM IA. Monochrome bowls are referred to by Popham as ogival cups and occur in the MUM S. Corridor lower deposit: MUM, pl. 144.17-8. In the contemporary Pit VI from the Stratigraphical Museum Site, Warren refers to the same shape as bowl type 1: Warren 1991, 326 fig. 7 a-b. 178 The 'Jackson Pollock Style' seems to starts in LM IA but the LP fragment resembles in shape Warren's LM IB examples: Warren 1996, 48 pl. 13 a and c. 179 Popham 1970a, pl. 14 a from the Royal Villa. 180 Compare MUM, pl. 176.8 and 4 for LM IIIAi examples with Popham MUM, pl. 160 for LM II. 181 The clay of most LM II fine and coarse wares has a whitish buff almost pale green colour. Clays tend to be rather soft, with black rounded inclusions and the decoration applied tends to be rather faded. This particular colour is probably the result of high temperature firing, Jones 1986, 757. 'Green fabrics' have become a hallmark of Knossos LM II, although they seem to start in LM IB and continue until the early stages of LM IIIAi : Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 22; MUM, 181.</page><page sequence="98">THE ARCHITECTURE 87 Fig. 3.3.

During conservation it became clear that the two gypsum doorjamb blocks visible on either side of the wall were actually re- used as bases for vertical wooden beams and not part of a blocked doorway as marked by Doll in plan 17. The vertical wooden beams did not rest directly on the doorjambs but rather on a stone set on top of the re-used gypsum doorjambs. Earth was bright red terracotta in colour, obviously burned. Fairly large quantities of pottery were collected amongst which were several LM I type conical cups. Noticeable is the absence of the taller ledge-rim variety, typical of a MM IIIB/LM IA rather than a LM IA date.182 The decorated sherds fit into a LM IA horizon. LP95/P117 is the body sherd of a cup with retorted rather than running spirals, which probably argues for a LM IA rather than a MM IIIB/LM IA date (fig. 3.3: 22). 183 LP95/P118, a bowl fragment decorated in the 'in and out' style with floral sprays as a body band on its exterior surface (fig. 3.3: 23). 184 A terminus ad quern for the foundation of this wall is LM IA. West Wall (Zembil #65) (pottery not illustrated) Sherds were collected from the N end and upper courses of the w wall. Material is scrappy, dating generally to LM I apart from one LM IIIAi sherd, LP9/P1 20, a ledge rim of shallow bowl with mud- plaster on it. There is also a rim fragment of Warren's SEX Site Pit VI cup type 4 'tea cup' with light on dark spiral decoration (P95/P121).185 The very small amount of pottery collected does not allow any firm conclusions as to its construction date. ROOM 14 (ZEMBIL #67) (FIG. 3.3: 13-15) A few sherds were collected from earth deposit of Room 1 2, which was not backfill but unexcavated, unburned soil. The sherds collected should give a indication of when the floor was raised. Pottery is scrappy, a mixture of different periods dating from MM IIIB/LM IA to LM II and LM IIIAi at the latest. The rim fragment of a ledge-rim bowl with ripple decoration dates to MM IIIB/LM IA (LP95/P136) (fig. 3.3: 13), whereas a complete profile conical cup is of the general LM I type (LP95/ Pi 39) (fig. 3.3: 14). The rim fragment of a LM III type conical cup186 (LP95/P137) (fig. 3.3: 15) together with the body fragment of a fine kylix/cup (LP95/P135). There is also a large body fragment of a LM III bucket (LP95/138) in a coarse buff greenish clay with rounded white and black inclusions covered by a light slip at its exterior and interior. These sherds may provide a terminus ad quern for raising the floor in Room 14. West WM(Zembils #9, #17) (plan 39) LM I type sherds were collected from the n end of the w wall, n of the vertical beam and original plaster. Sherds were also accidentally collected from the floor, these are very scrappy and date generally to LM I apart from one body fragment of a champagne cup (not catalogued). Since contaminated, the material should not be trusted. room 15 North Wall (Zembil #69 and #70) (fig. 3.3: 24-25) The upper courses of the w end of this rubble wall were conserved. There were no traces of burning. Amongst the MM IIIB/LM IA material is the fragment of a cup in ripple LP95/P158 (fig. 3.3: 25). There are a few LM II- III fabrics amongst the collected sherds. The small sample collected cannot provide any firm dating evidence. West Wall (Zembil #59) (fig. 3.3: 28-31) Sherds were collected from lower courses of rubble packing behind the ashlar blocks of the West Facade. No traces of burning were noticed in the soil.

ROOM 16 West Wall (Zembil #46 and #49) (fig. 3.4: 1-7) This rubble wall forms the back face of the W Facade. The rubble packing for the facade's ashlar blocks is thicker for the first two courses but since both sections have earth as bonding material they have to be considered original. The lower courses of the rubble packing including the nw and sw corners of the room were cleaned for consolidation. Pottery was collected from the lower courses of the rubble packing near the sw corner. Material is scrappy, dating generally to MM IIIB/LM IA but with a few LM IL LP95/P193 is the rim fragment of a monochrome bowl with matt orange red paint, dating to MM IIIB/LM IA.187 Also contemporary are LP95/P188 and LP95/P189, two ledge-rim type conical cups. LP/P194 is a body fragment of a LM II semi-coarse storage vessel in buff green clay with a pattern of reeds visible as exterior decoration (fig. 3.4: 1).188 LP95/P190 is a LM II handless cup with reed motif in a fine 'green fabric'; LP95/P191, the base of a LM II type handless cup, probably with reed pattern decoration again in a LM II type fine 'green fabric' (fig. 3.4: 3);189 LPg5/Pig2 the rim fragment of a LM II goblet/kylix.190 Pottery was also collected from the s end of the w wall (Zembil #45). The material is scrappy MM IIIB/LM IA. During cleaning it became obvious that this particular section of the W Facade together with part of the s wall of Room 1 6 are founded directly on a rubble wall which accordingly runs under the W Facade and the s wall of Room 16 at a nnw-sse angle (fig. 3.4: 8-12). The earth near the wall was not kouskouras but unexcavated levels. The nw and sw corners were slightly cleaned out revealing only the top of what is probably a floor deposit. No traces of fire were observed but the pottery collected dates to pure MM III A (Zembil #44). The absence of any sherds with ripple decoration combined with the presence of a rim fragment of a straight sided and ribbed one handled cup with white dots on a matt black background (LP95/P107) date the deposit to MM IIIA (fig. 3.4: 8).191 LP95/P104 is a wheel-made shallow bowl (fig. 3.4: 1 1); LP95/P105 and LP95/P106 rim fragments of S-profile one- handled cups (fig. 3.4: 9-10). 192 ROOM 17 East Wall: Blocking of East Balustrade (Zembils #81 and #82) (fig. 3.4: 13-15, plan 38) A small group of sherds was collected from the make-up of the rubble and earth wall which blocked the e balustrade. Earth was obviously very burned. Apart from a group of sherds, which generally date to LM I, three sherds can be dated to LM IIIAi at the latest. These consist of a very small rim fragment of a LM II cup/goblet LP95/P198 collected from the N end of the blocking wall (fig. 3.4: 13);193 a ledge-rim fragment of a LM II or LM IIIAi cup or kylix (fig. 3.4: 14)194 LP95/P199 and finally the body sherd of cup with thin body bands which can be dated to LM IIIAi (LP95/P200) (fig. 3.4: 15) because of its fine warm buff lustrous surface.195 A terminus ad quern for the construction of this partition wall, which blocked the e balustrade, is LM IIIAi. ROOM 19 West Wall (Zembil #31) (fig. 3.4: 16-24) Sherds were collected from the rubble make-up of this wall, where the earth used as bonding material was burned and had acquired a bright red colour. The rubble masonry was so heavily burned that the stones had obtained a grey colour rather than the usual buff brown. The wall had been partly repaired by the 23rd Ephorate in the 1970s. Material is scrappy, including LM I sherds; but the latest clearly date to LM II and LM IIIAi. The large rim fragment of a LM II pithoid jar, of a semi-coarse buff 187 Warren 1991, 327 fig. 8 i. 188 The interior splashes of paint on the LP sherd suggest that it belongs to a jar with a rather open mouth such as MUM, pl. 76 f rather than an LM II coarse stirrup iar such as MUM, pl. 72 c-d. 189 MUM, pl. 59 d-i and pl. 151.10-12. 190 MUM, pi 151.1-6. 191 Catling et al 1979, 78; Warren and Hankey 1989, 57; Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 19. 192 The shallow bowl with its pronounced rim resembles cups from the Acropolis Houses Deposit B: Catling et al. 1979, 29 fig. 19.109. 193 Quirks very often replace a rim band on LM II goblets: MUM, pl. 149.6, pl. 150.5 and pl. 158.1-2.

The ledge-rim conical cup (LP95/P162) dating to MM IIIB/LM IA and a LM I type conical cup (LP95/P1 70), together with a LM IA body fragment of a cup with spiral decoration (LP95/163), are amongst the earlier material (fig. 3.5: 3).199 Later sherds include a LM IIIAi ledge-rim monochrome cup fragment (LP95/P166) (fig. 3.5: 6), the body fragment of a LM III cup with thin body bands (LP95/P164) (fig. 3.5: 4) and the base of a ladle handle LP95/P170 that dates to LM IIIA (fig. 3.5: 5). The ladle seems to have become popular in LM IIIA2 although the earliest example, in bronze, comes from Zapher Papoura and dates to LM IIIAi.200 A terminus ad quern for this wall is LM IIIA. Rubble walling (Zembil #41) These narrow strips of rubble walling rested on earth at a higher level than the present floor. Only a few sherds were collected from under this strange construction dating to either MM IIIB/LM IA or LM IA. The interior of the rubble walling was cleaned in the process of consolidation (Zembil #42). Amongst the very scrappy material is a cup fragment with LM IA spiral (LP95/P172). room 23 Between the West Wall of Room 23 and East End of Room 22 South Wall The material collected was very scrappy with sherds dating generally to LM I, except for one rim fragment of a LM III type conical cup fragment LP95/P182.

The w half is rebuilt down to its first course in a careless manner compared to the E and original half. The pottery collected from the make-up of the rebuilt E section dates to LM IA such as the two rim fragments LP95/P92 and LP95/P94, which have a bright orange paint and a polished surface, typical of LM IA (fig. 3.5: 14-15);201 LP95/P91 is a MM IIIB/LM IA bell bowl type 3 in Warren's terminology.202 A few sherds were collected from the w end of the wall where it bonds to the W Storage Room Facade. Included amongst the scrappy material are sherds in light-on-dark and dark-on-light with added white dating to the MM IIIB/LM IA horizon.203 The latter group of sherds provide a terminus ad quern for the construction of the original wall, whereas the former provide a LM IA date for the re-build of the wall's w half. South Wall: North Section (fig. 3.5: 17-41) The N half of the dividing wall between Rooms 29 and 30 was consolidated and many sherds were collected from its make-up. The earth which together with the sherds was used as bonding material was of a pale buff colour, obviously unburned. Here the assemblage of stray and broken sherds used as building material is extremely homogeneous in date, ranging from LM IIIAi to LM IIIA2. The body fragment of a cup with thin-thick bands below a frieze of alternating arcs dates to LM IIIA2 late providing a terminus ad quern for the foundation of this wall (fig. 3.5: 17).204 Amongst the earlier sherds are the usual LM IIIAi plain ledge rims belonging to cups/kylikes (fig. 3.5: 21).205 The ledge rim and classic spiral decoration with undulating lines of LP95/P8 (fig. 3.5: 18)206 together with the body fragment of a fine closed vessel decorated with alternating rows of quirks and dots (LP95/P10) also date to LM IIIAi (fig. 3.5: 26).207 LP95/P7 has the straighter rim of the early LM IIIA2 type, its decoration of alternating V's and bivalves typical of the period (fig. 3.5: 19).208 There are several rim fragments of either champagne cups or straight-sided cups dating to LM IIIA2. All handle fragments have the LM IIIA2 ovoid sections, none however has the LM IIIB round section (fig. 3.5: 33-34). 209 There are also two bases of kalathoi, LM IIIA kylikes and LM IIIA2 champagne cups (fig. 3.5: 37-41). 21° In the course of removing Evans's cement from the wall dividing Rooms 29 and 30 it was recognised that the narrow 10 cm space between the n and s sections of the wall was filled in with pale buff unburned earth. Pottery from this section is contemporary with that from the make-up. Amongst the material collected is a LM IIIAi ledge-rim cup (LP95/P27) and two kylix stem fragments (LP95/P3oandLP95/P3i). ROOM 30 South MM (figs. 3.6: 1-16 and 3.7: 1-8) The N half of the dividing wall between Rooms 30 and 34 is also a later addition abutting the original wall. Similar to the N half of the dividing wall between Rooms 29 and 30, the earth used as bonding material was unburned, having a pale buff colour. The pottery was collected in groups, from the E and w half, upper and lower courses, but all proved to contain contemporary sherds dating to LM IIIAi and LM IIIA2. Apart from the usual plain ledge-rim fragments of cups and kylikes, amongst the decorated sherds LP95/P66211 and LP95/59 (fig. 3.6: 12)212 date to LM IIIAi, whereas LP95/P52 with its straight sided rim date to LM IIIA2 (fig. 3.6: 1 1).213 Noteworthy is the rim fragment of a plain bowl with interior and exterior rim band: its out-turned rim resembles LM IIIB rather than LM 201 Warren and Hankey iq8q, 72. 202 Warren iqqiö, 326 fig. 7 k. 203 Warren and Hankey 1989, 72-4. 204 For thin-thick bands: MUM, pl. 115.5 and 8; Warren and Hankey 1989, 85; Watrous 1992, 130-1; Warren 1997, 177; Watrous iQQ2, fig. 46.1251. 205 MUM, pl. 176; Hallager 1997, 20-21; Popham 19700, 103 fig. 9. 206 pOpnam 10700, 108, fig. 14.04-5. 207 Popham 10,700, 105 fig. 11.1 and a; 106 fig. 12.31-2. 208 Warren and Hankey 1989,86; Popham 19700, 68-9; MUM, 182.

Amongst the sherds collected is a fragment of the LM IIIAi pyxis (fig. 3.7: 5) joining 327 (fig. 4.31: 1) from Evans's P. I. boxes. Apart for some LM IIIAi sherds the bulk of the material dates to LM IIIA2, such as the rim fragment of a large plain kylix (fig. 3.7: 6).215 room 36 Wall C(fig. 3.7: 10-20) In the ne quarter of Room 36 lies a single course rubble wall running E-w, which is the foundation course for the mud-plaster wall reported by Evans and visible in plate 76. It rests some 5 cm above the present earthen floor level and required much consolidation. In the process of cleaning, sherds were collected from under the wall and above a burned earthen floor level. This floor, which in patches had a dark grey colour, is the continuation under Wall C of the present floor surface in Room 36. Pottery dates to LM IIIA1/2. There are the usual LM IIIAi ledge-rim type decorated cups, such as LP95/P88, LP95/P89, LP95/P86 with interior sponge decoration (fig. 3.7: 11-12, 17).216 The broad rim conical cup fragments fits into the LM IIIA sequence LP95/P87 (fig. 3.7: 14) as well as the large rim fragment of a basin in pale white greenish clay. Amongst the closed shape vessels LP95/ P76 is the rim fragment of a semi-coarse LM IIIA piriform jar (fig. 3.7: 17), whereas the flower depicted on LP95/P85 in a fine clay dates to either LM II or LM IIIAi. The latest sherd, dating to LM IIIA2 early, belongs to a plain cup with a straight rim (fig. 3.7: 18). Finally the tripod cooking pot leg in a red coarse clay has an ovoid section. The new stratigraphical evidence from Room 36 provides a well-defined sequence of events. The date for the addition of the two low rubble walls A and B remains unclear, however these were founded prior to Wall C. Room 36 suffered from a fire destruction when LM IIIAi and LM IIIA2 early pottery was in use. Subsequently the room was cleaned of its destruction debris and a new earthen floor was set at a slightly higher level. Wall C was used as a foundation course for a mudbrick wall construction, which created a partition-like space along the se end of the room. Conclusions The MUM restoration has been an invaluable test for checking the validity of information collected from the LR The MUM walls have produced pottery which is roughly contemporary to an 'event' that took place within the room or area in question as confirmed by the stratigraphical sequence presented by Popham. The same principle has been applied for the LP, where pottery from the rubble make-up of a wall is interpreted to represent some roughly contemporary repair or other activity. The results of the 1995 conservation have been revealing for reconstructing history of the LP. Only major points will be summarised here, as a fuller account will follow the presentation of the Evans pottery in Chapter 4, which will offer more missing pieces for the LP stratigraphy puzzle. There is evidence for MM IIIA activity on site prior to the foundation of the LP, an event that took place in MM IIIB/LM IA or let us say after Evans's 'Great Earthquake'. Such a date is now also suggested by the restoration results. LM IA pottery collected from the rubble make-up of certain walls implies repairs, which possibly took place some time during this period. Extensive restorations are implied, which must have taken place before or simultaneously with the remodelling of the E and N Sectors, but before the deposition of LM IIIA 1/2 pottery in this part of the LP. More importantly, the LM IIIA2 pottery collected from the additional walls in the Magazines (Rooms 28-30) hint at extensive re-building sometime around that period. The chart below summarises the dating evidence provided by the 1995 23rd Ephorate restoration work at the LP. The dates refer to the latest sherds collected from the rubble make-up of the repaired walls, unless otherwise stated. References are also made to the colour the soil, used in the wall make- up. Buff implies unburned, whereas red-terracotta the action of fire on the soil. 214 Cf. profile to MUM, pl. 170.1. 215 Warren and Hankey 1989, 85; Warren 1997, 181, 163 fig. 13, 176 fig. 32; Hallager 1997, 29. 21(1 MUM, pl. 172.6.</page><page sequence="107">96 THE ARCHITECTURE Fig. 3.7.

All LP selected pottery and miscellaneous small finds are stored in 34 boxes, which have been housed in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos since the 1960s. Originally, these were kept in straw baskets, a usual practice in the early days of the excavation, and their provenance was given on wooden labels attached to them. In 1913, Evans initiated the project of gradually replacing all deteriorating baskets with wooden boxes, a task completed by Pendlebury in 1931.1 Unlike most material from Knossos, the LP pottery was always housed within the building itself, in Room 17 and the adjacent Room 12. Both rooms were used as an extension to the Palace 'Reference Museum', after they had been provided with a permanent roof in 1910 (plate 1 a-b).2 A catalogue of the original boxes was published in Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933-5 under the P. I. series, later to be completed by a list dating the contents of each box and supplying a plan, which assigned the boxes to specific rooms or areas (plan 51).3 Finally after 1963, these were re-boxed and transferred to the newly constructed Stratigraphical Museum.4 THE SOURCES A severe obstacle in the study of the LP sherd material is the lack of Pottery Notebooks for the years during which this building was excavated. It is doubtful whether Mackenzie kept separate notes on the pottery: on the LP wooden labels, which accompany the pottery boxes, there is no reference to a Pottery Notebook page. The addition of such information was a regular practice in the earlier years of the excavation in the Palace, for which period such notebooks have survived.5 Moreover, in the Evans Photographic Archive there are no negatives or prints of LP sherd material; and none of the sherds assigned to the building bear pencil marks by Mackenzie. Although the existence of a Pottery Notebook for the years relevant to this discussion should not be excluded, the lack of evidence in several areas indicates that Mackenzie never studied the material in any great detail. Unfortunately, Mackenzie's 1905 remarks on the pottery discovered are rather vague and unhelpful. The first reference comes at quite late stage in the 1 905 season, two weeks after the excavation had commenced, when at least seven rooms had been excavated down to the level of the paved floors. It was in connection with the deposits from Rooms 22-26 that Mackenzie reported that 'the pottery found was also invariably of the same Late Minoan III character as elsewhere in the house'.6 Furthermore on plan 9, 'many plain LM III cups' were marked, on the w half of Room 22. In the BSA report for 1905, although Evans made explicit references to the 're-occupation' date for the deposits discovered, he omitted any reference to associated pottery groups. References in the 1908 notebook reflect some puzzlement on Mackenzie's part over the styles of the discovered pottery: Throughout the area covered by the W. House and the interval between it and the new building the greater confusion prevailed everywhere in the deposit. The pottery next the floor levels was for the most part LM III while here and there occurred fragments of fine Palace Style pottery such as those of a handsome tall jar with graceful reed-like plant design in very fine brown-black glaze on a half ground. But it was characteristic that the fragments of this vase were found scattered over the whole area outside the SW. angle of the W. House and no amount of pains could enable us 1 Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933-5, l~2- 2 Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933-5, l~2- 3 Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933, 24; 1934, 15-16; 1935, plan 21. 4 Popham 19700, 12. 5 The six surviving volumes of Mackenzie's pottery notebooks are dated from 1901 to 1904.

This vase was apparently typical of the LM II Period when the house was at its prime previous to its reoccupation &amp; remodelling by the later people.'7 The lack of deposits rich in finds was rectified during the search for stray fragments of the steatite bull's head rhyton (SFi) where the excavators 'came upon several important fragments of vases (jars amphorae) of the Palace Style in the corridor N of the W. stair. In the adjoining spaces further N (2 and entrance to 1 ) were found the fragments of the gourd- vase with curious loop design in relief and waving pattern in the flat. (LM II)' (338, fig. 4.32: 2, plate 20 b-d). These were reported by Mackenzie as 'floor deposits' and pointed out on plan 1 2 : 'In 2 and entrance to 1 gourd vase with loop ornament etc in relief. In 4 jar with papyrus (rim) Amphora with net (shoulder) work design' (84, fig. 4.32: 4). Terracotta bull's head (mouth lacking)' (339, fig. 4.32: 3, plate 21 a). A second group of clay vessels included a squat and a tall alabastron (336-337, fig. 4.32: 1, 6), found together with the clay bull's head rhyton in the area N of Staircase 34 (339, fig. 4-32).8 It is surprising that Evans and Mackenzie could report so few pottery deposits from a building of this size. Setting aside the evidence provided by the P. I. boxes, to be presented later in the chapter, the following observations can be made: of the three pottery 'deposits' reported, only the one consisting of plain 'LM IIP cups in Room 22 was discovered during 1905 and dated by Mackenzie to the 're- occupation' period. Two more deposits were reported in 1908, the first discovered within Rooms 29 and 30, the second in the space below the upper flight of Staircase 34. Each consisted of exquisite vases, which impressed by their style or suggested function, such as the 'ewer' (338, fig. 4.32: 2), the terracotta bull's head rhyton (339, fig. 4.32: 3) and the Palace Style 'jar with network design' (84, fig. 4.32: 4). All the vessels reported were dated to the 'Last Palace Period', namely 'LM IP. THE PROVENANCE OF THE LITTLE PALACE BOXES The original intention was to accept Pendlebury's attribution of the P. I. boxes to specific rooms or areas within the LP, but it has been considered necessary to re-examine the provenance of each box, according to the reference made on the original labels. Only 15 boxes still contain their original wooden labels. For the remaining 20 evidence comes from the details written on the box at the time when these went through their final re-boxing in the 1960s. Because supplementary information is lacking, in such cases the box references are considered as essentially accurate. All surviving wooden labels are inscribed in pencil by Mackenzie. The year of the excavation is always prefaced by the letter Ä, which indicates Knossos. Mackenzie used almost exclusively the name 'Petit Palais', which also occurs in the 1908 DM/DB and was obviously his favourite term. Then follows the name of the specific room or area the pottery came from. All surviving 1908 labels are accompanied by references written in Greek. The latter practice would have had no purpose if Mackenzie had already inscribed each one, so in such cases the Greek writing must predate Mackenzie's. On the original boxes, the building was named 'Little Palace', which suggests that these were inscribed after 1910, when this name had been established. Pendlebury seems to have followed the box inventory details, if these were legible enough, rather than the labels themselves, which explains the occurrence of different provenances between labels and boxes. Accordingly, it has been deemed necessary to re-examine the room attribution for those boxes which have their original wooden labels preserved. Nine boxes, assigned to six different rooms, have survived from the 1905 excavation season.9 For those boxes where wooden labels have survived,10 the material in question has been allocated to various rooms on the basis of one repeated reference point, namely the 'north landing of Stair', which corresponds to the term 'Stair N. landing' used by Evans in the 1905 AE/NB sealings list. There is no doubt that Staircase 32 is the reference point in question, since it was the single staircase excavated during 1905. More difficult to locate is the 'north landing', since the term was not used in either DM/ DB or AE/NB. The most obvious candidate is the area where the upper flight landing of Staircase 32 would have been originally located, namely along the w end of Room 25. The choice of this particular architectural feature as a reference point becomes apparent when the usual excavation progress is considered, from the surface down to the floor levels but also the exceptionally well preserved architecture in this part of the building.11 7 DM/DB 17. vi. 08, 84. Mackenzie's 'reed vase' most probably can be identified with the fragmentary Palace Style jar with papyrus decoration (340, fig. 4.32: 5). 8 AE/NB 1908; Evans 1914, 87-8. 9 These are P. I. 4, P. I. 5, P. I. 6, P. I. 7, P. 1. 9 and P. I. 10. 10 P. I. 4, P. I. 9 and P. I. 10. 11 According to Doll's 1910 pencil plan (plan 17), the w wall of Staircase 32 stood to a maximum height of 70 cm and the staircase landing in question at 1 .45 m.</page><page sequence="111">THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY i o i P. I. 4 consists of two boxes, #1430 and #1431, which according to their wooden labels, contain material from the 'Room of Cups + surface deposit' and from the 'North l...ding of st... Room of cups' respectively. According to DM/DB and AE/NB, a deposit of cups was found and sketched in Room 22. Pendlebury, however, incorrectly assigned these to Room 12, probably because he identified the steps referred to on the labels with those leading down to the sunken area of Room 17, instead of Staircase 32. Consequently, P. I. 4 should be associated with Room 22 rather than Room 12. The term 'North landing of Stair' was again used as a reference point for two more boxes, the position of both being E (P. I. 10) and w (P. I. 9) of Staircase 32. Although a larger number of boxes has survived from the 1 908 excavation season, their allocation to specific parts of the building involves fewer problems than the 1 905 boxes. Two boxes, with identical references in Greek have used yet again Staircase 32 as a reference point. P. I. 8 came from the area 'A. rr|ç Exátaxç xr|ç N. Avaxo^oxr|ç' and P. I. 16 'Ano tt|v ZxaÀa tt|v NA Auxixá'. Since, P. I. 8 contains the 'amphora with network pattern' (84, fig. 4.32: 4), which was discovered in the area of the upper flight of Staircase 34 and the s end of the Magazines, the contents of this box could be associated with this area in general. The provenance of P. I. 16 brings more complications. According to the original label, the box contained material from the 'Area of stair up W', identified by Pendlebury with Staircase 5. This assignment is, however, incorrect since on several occasions Mackenzie used the above term in relation to Staircase 32. The location of P. I. 16 has to be moved to the area w of Staircase 32. Mackenzie allocated P. I. 9 to the 'Room of Gypsum Doorjambs', which Pendlebury identified with Room 28. If Mackenzie was considering the orientation of the doorjambs, Room 26 rather than 27 was the one he meant. The exact position of P. I. 11 will have to remain doubtful. The label refers only to an area 'From within W. Facade' whereas in Greek it specifically points to the region 'N. A. xr|ç £xá5uxç xr|ç N'. In spite of the correct association of this box with the area of Staircase 34, the exact find-spot for the contents remains obscure. It would be tempting to follow the Greek reference and associate the box with Room 36. Finally the provenance and year of excavation for boxes as labelled 'P. I. GEN.' has to be considered. Unfortunately, little information can be extracted from the wooden labels since these usually record only the building's name. They undoubtedly contain material from the LP, since cross-joins have been verified, mainly with pottery collected during 1908. Consequently, it is suspected that most P. I. GEN. boxes came from the sw part of the site, the main focus of the 1908 excavation season. Plan 52 presents a revised plan for the provenance of all P. I. boxes. Those assigned more generally to certain parts of the building are marked in different shading. THE NATURE OF THE MATERIAL As with most pottery from Evans's excavations at Knossos, the sherds collected from the LP went through a vigorous selection process, before they were stored in the roofed over Room 17. The absence of any Pottery Notebooks for the years the building was excavated further complicates matters; details on the processes and criteria for selecting and storing are lacking. Moreover, no information has survived on the number and volume of rejected baskets compared with those which were finally kept. The majority of LP pottery consists of rim or body fragments from decorated, open shapes. Bases, handles, and body sherds with linear decoration or simply plain, whether belonging to decorated open or closed fine ware shapes, are all lacking. In addition, fine but plain pottery, unless fairly complete, together with any cooking or other coarse fabrics are also missing. Feature sherds and datable pottery were discarded, a common practice during the first decade of Evans's excavations at Knossos.12 Only pottery that came from tests below floors was less vigorously culled, but this applies mainly to the Palace.13 It is a regular occurrence amongst the LP pottery that several rim and body sherds with fresh breaks represent the remains of a vase, which must have been found fairly complete (figs. 4.4: 9, 4.5: 1, 4.19: 3, 4.23: 11, 4.30: 1). Without underestimating the importance of fairly complete pottery of any given date in reconstructing the LP stratigraphy, the quantity of fairly complete LM IIIA versus LM IIIB vases cannot be used as the main criterion for dating the LP destruction. 12 The selected and kept pottery from the Royal Villa, S. E. House, South House and South Front, to name only a few, is very similar in character to that kept from the LP. 13 In the LP such a case is P. I. i containing the largely unselected pottery, which was found together with the famous bull's head rhyton.</page><page sequence="112">1O2 THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY Another problem is attributing provenance: according to the wooden labels and box references, the selected pottery represents sometimes the contents of one room, or sometimes of a larger area. A severe limitation in the study of these groups is the failure, on the excavators' part, to retain the pottery systematically in separate lots, according to their stratigraphical sequence, when and if this was observed during the excavation. The excavation method applied, namely digging by spits or in section, is also responsible for the thorough mix-up of different ceramic periods. Such an excavation method would have missed out robbing pits made for the removal of walls or rubbish pits, which were abundant on the adjacent Minoan and post-Minoan MUM site. As a result the LP boxes contain a mixture of Minoan but also post-Minoan pottery. Consequently, the retained pottery can be dated and assigned to different ceramic periods only, on stylistic grounds.14 The 35 boxes of selected and kept sherds from the LP site cannot be compared to the volumes of pottery published from the MUM, illustrating that what is preserved is only a fraction of what had been originally retrieved. Defining primary and secondary contexts such as floor deposits, pits, rubbish levels or simply wash levels is not straightforward. Much of the pottery has been already published in some detail by Popham who noted that the bulk of the retained material dates to either LM IIIA or LM IIIB late, both ceramic phases being represented by complete vases and contemporary sherds.15 In terms of quantity, these are followed by LM IA pottery. LM IB, LM II, mature LM IIIC and sub-Minoan sherds are present in isolated cases. Some Hellenistic and a few Roman sherds occur amongst the later material; they have not been considered in this study. THE POTTERY SEQUENCE MM IIIB/LM IA and LM IA: A Note on Terminology Evans found ample evidence for a massive earthquake destruction at Knossos, which he called the 'Great Destruction'.16 This seismic horizon, which left evident marks at the Palace and town, is contemporary - at least in ceramic terms - with the Seismic Destruction on Thera.17 At Knossos this ceramic phase is characterized by the co-existence of pottery decorated in the MM light-on-dark and LM dark-on-light lustrous decorative style. Because of this overlap of styles within contemporary deposits, various terminologies have been employed. Evans, and subsequently Hood, used the term MM IIIB: their studies were based mainly on deposits from the Palace, which are often highly selected, lack decorated wares and thus are difficult to date.18 Popham in the MUM publication was reluctant to use MM IIIB or early LM IA and introduced the term MM IIIB/LM IA 'to express continuing indecision, rather than to suggest that they belong to a transitional stage'.19 Warren took the argument a step further and modified the term into MM IIIB-LM IA transitional in order to emphasize the overlap in styles.20 Driessen and Macdonald suggested the use of the term early LM IA, but preferred the term MM IIIB/LM IA.21 The contemporary LP pottery is highly selected so cannot offer a solution to the problem of nomenclature. In this book the term MM IIIB/LM IA has been adopted to define the ceramic phase in use at Knossos at the time of the earthquake destruction described by Evans as the 'Great Destruction'. Finally the term LM IA has been used to define the pottery styles in use at Knossos at the time of the Volcanic Destruction on Thera.22 MM IIIB/LM IA and LM IA from the Little Palace Apart from a small number of stray non-joining and often worn sherds, present in almost every P. I. box, there are six major assemblages of 'earlier pottery' from the LP.23 Chief amongst these are P. I. 1 and P. I. 17, but also P. I. 4, P. I. 7, P. I. 12 and P. I. 13. The first two, even though they appear 14 Only a few boxes, namely P. I. 9, P. I. 11 and P. I. GEN. #1458, contain almost exclusively complete pots. Unfortunately, none of these is referred to in the excavation records, as regards exact location and stratigraphical context. Only two boxes, namely P. I. 17 and P. I. 1 , contain plain pottery and this has not even been washed, possibly indicating that the contents are intact and not pre-selected. Most P. I. boxes, such as P. I. 7, P. I. 8, P. I. 12 and P. I. 14, consist almost entirely of decorated sherds, assigned to a variety of pottery phases. 15 Popham 19700, 62-3; Popham 1970^, 195-202. 1(5 PAf II, 347-50, 360-4. 17 Marthari 1984, 61-7; Warren 19910, 332-3. 18 Hood 1996. 19 MUM, 158. 20 Warren 1991, 332-3. 21 Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 10-21, with useful summary regarding terminology and the development of LM I ceramic styles. 22 MUM, 158; Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 19-21. 23 Since the bulk of the kept LP pottery dates to LM III, by 'earlier pottery' MM IIIB/LM IA and LM IA are indicated.</page><page sequence="113">THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY 1O3 to be homogeneous deposits, are in many respects problematic since they contain only a few diagnostic sherds.24 The remaining four, consist mainly of fine decorated pottery and plain conical cups which have been selected and separated from the LM III pottery on stylistic and not stratigraphie criteria. These features become an obstacle for dating the above assemblages since pottery groups are assigned to MM IIIB/LM IA or LM IA according to the combination of shapes and motifs present amongst a particular pottery cluster.25 Before attempting to date the contents of these boxes, to MM IIIB/LM IA or LM IA, the typical features of each phase will be outlined. Since regional variations in the pottery styles existed on Crete within these periods, I shall use mainly Knossian deposits to provide comparative material. Two well stratified deposits from Knossos, treated by Warren as contemporary in ceramic terms, can define the MM IIIB/LM IA pottery phase. These are the MUM deposit from the E end of the South Corridor and the fill below the LM IB North House at the Stratigraphical Museum Extension Site. Both were taken to represent the same event, namely some clear-out after an earthquake destruction.26 The main features of this phase have been outlined by means of these two deposits by both Popham and Warren. In character they are close to MM since the tradition of the light-on-dark technique is still evident, especially on the straight-sided cup but also on larger and coarser vessels. Dark-on-light decoration is already present on vases with linked spirals and others with tortoise-shell ripple, which remains the predominant form of decoration. This ceramic phase is characterised by the absence of the typical LM IA 'reed' cups. In shape, cups are mainly straight sided or globular; but the Vapheio version has already made its appearance. Handleless cups range from shallow and ogival to straight-sided. Bowls and 'fruit stands' are also present. The conical cup occurs in both its straight-sided and ledge-rim variations, although the latter comes in smaller percentages.27 In addition to the upper deposits from the Gypsades Well, considered as the type deposit for LM IA, two other pottery assemblages from Knossos will be outlined, since their fine pottery and plain conical cups make them comparable to the LP material.28 These are the MUM 'later stage' deposit from the w end of the South Corridor and the E.-W. Stairs Deposit from the Domestic Quarter of the Palace.29 The 'later stage' deposit from the w end of the South Corridor of the MUM, dated by Popham to Evans's 'mature' LM IA, contains better quality pottery, more decorated examples and has a wider range of motifs than the MUM 'early stage' deposit.30 Tortoise-shell ripple decoration becomes less frequent, as the spiral design is more common, whilst the 'reed' makes its appearance as a decorative motif on cups and jugs. Conical cups with straight-sided rims outnumber by far the ledge-rim type; the last becomes infrequent, being represented in a proportion of less than 10%. Miniature jugs are present in the South Corridor, but are also known from a foundation deposit within the East Corridor of MUM. Finally the deposit from the E.-W. Stairs of the Domestic Quarter included only a small amount of decorated pottery, mainly one-handled cups with reed decoration or retorted spirals. Here again conical cups with an undifferentiated lip outnumber those with a short horizontal ledge rim.31 The miniature jug, named by Evans 'the milk jug' appears here as well. This carelessly made plain vessel has a small lug close to the rim instead of a handle. Popham considered it as a possible type vase for LM IA.32 The material from the Gypsades Well, the MUM 'later' and the E.-W. Stairs of the Domestic Quarter, assigned to the mature stage of the LM IA style at Knossos, have been regarded by Marthari as contemporary to Group A pottery from the West House at Akrotiri, which is the pottery group from the final destruction level at this site.33 24 The contents of these boxes had not even been washed. 23 Warren and Hankey 1989, 61-2 and 74 where the main characteristics for defining MM IIIB/LM IA and LM IA ceramic phases are outlined. 26 Warren compares these pottery groups to several other deposits within Crete and the Aegean: Warren 19910, 333-40. The Cretan MM IIIB/LM IA ceramic phase seems to be contemporary with the early LM IA destruction horizon at Thera, referred to as the Seismic Destruction Level: Warren 19910, 338; Marthari 1984, 119-33. More recently, Marthari has associated the Group B pottery from the West House at Akrotiri, to the 'early stage' MM IIIB/LM IA pottery from the east end of the South Corridor in MUM: Marthari 1990, 66. 27 1:3 in MUM and 1:3.5 in tne North House fill: cf.

Other deposits including such miniature jugs are those assigned by Evans to the Snake Cult {PM IV, 140 fig. 109) and those found at the Temple Tomb roof terrace (PMIV, 1015 fig. 964). 33 Marthari 1990, 62-3.</page><page sequence="114">i o4 THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY To return to the LP: Evans, in two separate instances, reported the collection of sherds: first 'from the clay mortar in the interstices of the interior walls' and second, during the 1931 restoration work, from under the lower flight of Staircase 32. Both of these groups provide a terminus post quern for the construction of the LP.34 The former was assigned 'to the usual MM IIIB seismic stratum', the latter assigned to 'the beginning of the New Era after the great earthquake destruction at the close of MM HF. Unfortunately this material was not kept. However, a small number of stray non-joining and often worn sherds, retrieved from different P. I., boxes must represent material from the make-up of floors and walls. The absence of the reed motif amongst these, but the presence of the tortoise-shell ripple motif dates them to MM IIIB/LM IA. P. I. 1 contained very few diagnostic sherds decorated with the ripple motif on Vapheio, S-profile and in and out bowl fragments (fig. 4.1: 12-16). In addition there is a small number of sherds decorated in the light-on-dark technique. Six conical cups are of the usual LM I type, whereas three are of the taller version, identical to Warren's bowl type (fig. 4.1 : 3-1 1). The absence of classic LM IA decorative motifs such as the running spiral and reed indicate a MM IIIB/LM IA rather than a LM IA date for the contents of Space 35. Difficult to date are the contents of P. I. 17, where a base of a reed cup and a rim fragment of a cup with cross-hatched motif provide the only evidence for a LM I A date (not illustrated). The box provenance unhelpfully points to the areas outside the SE Angle of the LP. The largest LP assemblage of fine decorated LM IA pottery comes from P. I. 4. The main decorative motifs are tortoise-shell ripple on S-profile cups (6, fig. 4.2: 2), in and out decoration on a ledge rim cup fragment (7, fig. 4.2: 3) and a fairly complete shallow bowl (9, fig. 4.2: 1). 35 Amongst the conical cups, 19 are of the straight-rim LM I variety, whereas Warren's bowl type is also present with eight examples (figs. 4.2 and 4.3: 1-10). Two milk jugs complete the assemblage, which dates to LM IA, and can be considered as contemporary with the other deposits at Knossos mentioned above. This assemblage can be securely identified with the deposit of cups, found in Room 22, which was recorded by both Evans and Mackenzie but incorrectly dated to 'LM IIP. P. I. 7 is sadly an unreliable source, since cross-joins have been made with a variety of boxes scattered throughout different parts of the building (fig. 4.8: 1-4). Nevertheless it contains some interesting LM I A vases such as a large in and out bowl decorated with ivy (59, fig. 4.8: 1), in addition to the usual ripple decoration on S-profile cups (56-57, fig. 4.8: 2-3) and a fruit stand (58, fig. 4.8: 4). Another large group of LM I type conical cups, including one miniature jug, comes from P. I. 12 (fig. 4.14). 27 conical cups are of the usual LM I type, two of the tall version with a ledge rim, two more of the short version with a slight ledge rim and two of Warren's bowl type. If representing a homogeneous deposit, this group can also be dated to LM IA, due to the predominance of LM I type conical cups versus tall ledge-rim versions. Decorated sherds, which stylistically accompany this assemblage, also date to LM I A, such as the miniature bowl with in and out decoration (132, fig. 4.14: 1), the rim fragment of ajar decorated with horns of consecration (134, fig. 4.14: 3) and ajar with handles in the shape of figure-of-eight shields with ripple decoration (133, fig. 4.14: 2). The assemblage comes from the sw part of the LP but unfortunately its exact provenance remains unknown. Lastly, P. I. 13 contains a large group of fairly complete vases together with various stray sherds, which stylistically date to MM IIIB/LM IA and mature LM IA (fig. 4.20: 1-7). It is more likely that this assemblage does not derive from the LP but from the test Evans conducted along the E end of the South Corridor of the MUM, where Popham later discovered considerable amounts of pottery belonging to these phases.36 LM IB from the Little Palace Very few sherds can be dated to LM IB, all of which belong to the Special Palatial Tradition.37 The Marine Style pottery has been selectively published by Mountjoy.38 The most significant vessel from the LP is the Marine Style tall alabastron with type B octopus (336, fig. 4.32: 1, plate 20 a).39 An alternative LM II date has also been suggested, since its decoration is rather schematic and less elaborate 34 PM II, 514; ¿W IV, 216. 35 The decoration of rosette flowers on fig. 4.3: 4 can be compared to a cup from Phase IIIA at Mallia: Pelon 1970, pl. 15.3. Also compare a rhyton from Akrotiri: Marthari 1990, 62 fig. 5 b. 36 See MUM, 1 n. 2 and pl. 17 a, showing the excavation progressing in this area. 37 After Betancourt 1985, 140-8. 38 Mountjoy 1983, 173 and catalogue numbers P.

I. 14, is decorated in the Abstract Style (not illustrated).42 In general, the material assigned to this phase is scanty, suggesting the absence of any substantial LM IB levels within the building.43 Evans associated the Marine Style tall alabastron (336, fig. 4.32: 1) with a squat alabastron (337, fig. 4.32: 6) and the clay bull's head rhyton (339, fig. 4.32: 3), both of which date to LM IIIA1.44 Discovered in the region of the upper flight of Staircase 34, the Marine Style alabastron has to be considered an heirloom in the deposit. Notes on LM II and LM III Pottery45 Since the 1960s, the definition of the Knossian LM III ceramic sequence has been largely based on a series of studies by Mervyn Popham.46 Much of the stylistic framework for LM III was initially established through the study of the material from Evans's excavations, and thus is often based on stylistic observations due to the lack of more detailed stratigraphical data. Consequently, classification relied heavily on ceramic style, which left the boundaries between the different periods less well defined, especially from LM IIIA2 onwards. LM II The publication of MUM and the more recent excavation at the Stratigraphical Extension Museum Site (SEX) have contributed enormously to our knowledge of the local ceramic sequences and have reinforced Popham's taxonomy of LM II- III.47 As a result of the rich in pottery LM II destruction deposits from the MUM and SEX, this period has become one of the best-defined ceramic phases at Knossos. LM IIIAl LM IIIAi remains an easily defined ceramic phase, well documented through deposits from Evans's excavations such as the Royal Villa and the Passage of the Demon Seals, in addition to the destruction deposit along the N Corridor of the MUM and contemporary deposits at the SEX site, Trench Q.48 Uniformity in the ceramic styles of certain LM IIIAi sites in Central Crete such as Knossos and Kommos, and others like Khamalevri towards the w, enlarges our sample of comparative material.49 LM IIIA2 The MUM and SEX failed to produce large deposits contemporary with the early LM IIIA2 Palace destruction and as result such a domestic assemblage, with a good range of vessels in fine and coarser fabrics, is still much desired from Knossos.50 Similar is the situation for the subsequent LM IIIA2 and LM IIIB periods. Our knowledge of stratified LM IIIA2 comes from the MUM, Room H/L Pits 10+11 and Room C Pit 8 in particular, also from several contemporary ceramic assemblages from SEX, especially Trench T and from the poorly preserved remains of a LM IIIA2 house in Trench 40 Popham leaves the possibility open for a LM II date (Popham 19700, 62), whereas Betancourt dates the tall alabastron, together with the clay rhyton, to LM ILBetancourt 1985, 154. 41 Compare the arrangement of the floral motifs of 80 to the conical rhyton from Palaikastro (Betancourt 1985, 143 fig. 108) and a fragmentary jug from SEX: Warren 1981, 78 fig. 14. 42 Compare a series of vases in the Abstract Style from Zakros: Betancourt iq8r. ol. 22 a-c: Platon 1071. 111. 11 /Land 118. 43 Mountjoy lists two single Marine Style fragments, possibly of a stirrup jar (fig. 3.14) and ajar (fig. 3.2), and the base of a cup rhyton (fig. 3.15), which she associates with ritual contexts in the area: Mountjoy 1985, 235. However, these single sherds are too fragmentary to be considered as indicating complete vases, which could have fallen from the upper floor. 44 Evans 1Q14, 87-8, 45 Much of the LP pottery has been presented and studied in some detail by Popham.

It should be stressed that problems in the definition of LM IIIB are irrelevant to the debate over the destruction date of the Linear B archives at Knossos. Starting from the Palace, any stratigraphical correlation between different LM IIIB deposits is difficult since these are widely scattered around the building.53 Many of the complete vases consist of closed vessels, such as stirrup jars and the peculiar plain double vases from the North Entrance Passage.54 Even though there are some plain kylikes, champagne cups, ladles and kalathoi, there is a lack of deposits containing decorated cups and bowls, which could permit correlations with other LM IIIB deposits from Knossos, which happen to have a better selection of fine decorated wares.55 The Zapher Papoura cemetery is another source for LM IIIB pottery, but the range of shapes is limited to types which were fashionable as tomb offerings, a more general problem in correlating tomb material with domestic assemblages for LM III throughout the island.56 Popham's 1970 publication of a group of LP pottery, assigned to an advanced stage of LM IIIB, increased the amount of published LM IIIB, but highlighted the problem of stylistically correlating such deposits with the roughly contemporary pottery groups from the Palace. A similar problem exists with the LM IIIB material from the MUM.57 The re-occupied rooms of the N Sector were found largely empty and it seems that much of the complete pottery, which was left behind, fell from the upper floor. Most were plain wares or stirrup jars, reflecting the situation at the Palace. It is the contents of the N Platform Pits 2 and 4,58 together with Pit U, a dump outside a building in the area of the Stratigraphical Museum and the Royal Road North excavations, which produced contemporary and comparable pottery to the LP material, published by Popham.59 The SEX site revealed only minor LM IIIB deposits: these look earlier than the decorated material from the MUM N Platform pits. The material from the latter shows stylistic similarities to the early LM IIIC pottery from the SEX site.60 The stylistic relationship between the so-called LM IIIB late LP-MUM pottery and the SEX site LM IIIB and LM IIIC cannot be clarified with the help of the unstratified LP pottery groups, but the LM IIIB and LM IIIC ceramic sequence from the SEX site could provide the answer. TERMINOLOGY A note regarding terminology: the term LM IIIA1/2 has been used to indicate the combined appearance of LM IIIAi and early LM IIIA2 features on the LP pottery. An early LM IIIA2 date can be more easily ascribed on the basis of the shape of the decorated drinking cup, but also through more advanced decoration. Such principals are more difficult to apply on very fragmentary closed vessels. The LM IIIA1/2 term also reflects upon the Knossos Palace destruction pottery which was 'mostly LM IIIAi in style though the existence of some later features makes it best to ascribe the destruction, which has preserved it, to the very beginning of the LM IIIA2 phase'.61 Subsequently the term LM IIIA2 has been used when stylistic features of the LM IIIA1/2 ceramic phase are no longer present. In the present state of research, regarding LM IIIB pottery from Knossos, it is impossible to subdivide the period into LM IIIBi and IIIB2 terms which are regularly used in other contemporary Cretan sites.62 The 1994 Danish Institute at Athens workshop on Late Minoan III Pottery has highlighted the problems regarding terminology and definition of LM IIIB late and early LM IIIC.63 51 These pits were in Room C, the Pillar Hall H and Corridor L of the post-LM II MUM: MUM, 152, 182-4 and pls. 121 c~d&gt; 122,1 73-6.

LM II Pottery from the Little Palace Noticeable is the absence of LM II material from the LP especially in light of the events at the nearby MUM. The only substantial number of LM II sherds came from the area of the S Court, P. I. 14, where LM II destruction debris must have spilled over from the MUM.65 In 1920 Wace and Biegen searched for LM II Ephyrean goblets amongst the Evans boxes, including the LP material. Although sherds were selected and kept separately, it is most probable that these mainly came from P. I. 14 and thus should not have dramatically changed the picture of an almost total absence of LM II from the LP.66 LM III Pottery from the Little Palace fabrics Pottery reaches a high technical quality in LM IIIA.67 Clays are refined and contained only a few small inclusions. Knossian clay, when fired, ranges in colour between light buff (10 YR 8.4), pink (7.5 YR 8.4) to reddish-brown (5 YR 6.4) and can vary from soft and soapy to hard in texture. The pale buff slip is usually either of the same or slightly lighter colour than the core. The vase's surface is smoothed or polished. Paint ranges from black to yellowish-brown and bright red, usually with a glossy finish. A fine, rather soft and often soapy, whitish green fabric (5 YR 8.2), with black or white rounded inclusions, is also present. Different firing temperatures probably cause this peculiar colour.68 On such vases, the final polish and glossy black paint usually fades away, leaving a shadow or a matt pale yellowish brown paint.69 This is a LM II survival, which does not continue after LM IIIAi. It reappears in small quantities amongst the LM IIIB late LP sherds.70 LM IIIB clay pastes again range from fine buff to light brown (10 YR 8.4), although they are much harder, probably due to better firing.71 The slip is of a similar smooth buff nature, and the surface is polished. Unlike the earlier LM IIIA paints, colours range between a warm reddish-brown to a glossy chocolate-brown on the interior. A lustrous cherry-red colour often combined with a yellowish white slip, applied on the usual local buff clay, and creates an effect, which possibly intentionally resembles imports from Chania.72 Knossian potters could have been imitating the shiny effect with bright colours of the Chaniot workshop. There are, however, a few examples with a matt slip and paint.73 Although the bulk of the pottery can be classified as local Knossian, a few imported wares can be recognised from the difference in clays, slip and paint. The most easily distinguishable are imports from Chania, the earliest dating to LM II and LM IIIA, although most date to LM IIIB.74 These are of the typical Kydonian y ello wish- white clay (10 YR 8.2) with an orange-yellow to y ello wish- white slip.75 The surfaces are well polished and the paint applied is glossy, ranging from bright brown to reddish-orange paint. Equally characteristic are specimens in a non-Knossian deep red fabric with a thick yellowish-white slip, all dating to LM IIIA.76 Decoration on this distinctive fabric, which is well known from sites such as Palaikastro, is applied with a brownish red paint, which tends to flake off from the vase's surface (plate 19 c).77 The provenance, however, of certain LP fragmentary vases should not be identified with Palaikastro, but with another site also using the yellowish-buff slip on a dark red fabric, perhaps 64 See discussions after the papers of Kanta 1997; Warren 1997; Borgna 1997; Rethemiotakis 1997. 65 A small observation can be made about the fabrics present here. Only fine local wares are identified, namely a fine soft whitish to greenish clay with white or black particles and a buff- brown, well-fired clav with a matt finish. 66 French 1997, 149-50; these boxes are listed under S. I. in Pendlebury and Money- Coutts ío^-x. h7 Since the preserved pottery mainly consists of fine wares, the following discussion concentrates only on such fabrics. 88 Jones 1986, 759. 69 Such vases are: 321, fig. 4.30: 1; 257, fig. 4.24: 3; 248, fig. 4.23: 13; 34, FIG. 4.5: 3. 70 For example, 230, fig. 4.20: 16; fig. 4.21: 6. 71 Popham 1970^, 201 n. 24; Popham 1965, 317-18. 72 Such vases are: 04, fig. 4.11: 8; qi, fig. 4..11: a. 73 MUM, 185. 74 These include cup 115, fig. 4.12: 2, the spouted bowl 175, fig. 4.19: 2, plus fragments of kylikes 88, fig. 4.10: 18; jugs 278, fig. 4.25: 7; stirrup jars 297, fig. 4.26: 16; jar with double handles 278 fig. 4.25: 7.

The LM IIIAi ledge-rim cup, decorated with a reed pattern could not have been a product of Palaikastro, since its shape and decoration are foreign to the local workshop repertoire (145, fig. 4.15: 12). The body fragment of a LM IIIAi closed vessel decorated with foliate band (plate 19 c) and the body fragments of a LM IIIA pyxis decorated with net pattern are also in a similar fabric and slip (335, fig. 4.29: 13). These decorative motifs, which are comparable with contemporary Knossian examples, suggest a workshop which was highly influenced from Knossos. LM IIIA1/2 This phase is represented by a large number of sherds and fairly complete vases, present in almost every P. I. box and deriving from different parts of the building. However, within P. I. 5, P. I. 12 and P. I. 16, in particular, the LM IIIA 1/2 pottery is predominant over other ceramic phases. There is a greater variety of shapes, compared with subsequent pottery periods. Cross-joins are numerous amongst the LM IIIA 1/2 material implying a different stratigraphical situation to the LM IIIB pottery where cross-joins are almost non-existent (figs. 4.29-4.31). Potential 'Deposits' Although the majority of LP boxes contained LM IIIA 1/2 pottery it is worth isolating those few instances where the box contents belong almost exclusively to this period. P. I. 16, deriving from the area N or w of Staircase 32, most certainly represents the contents of a floor deposit. It contained two of the most complete LM IIIAi type ledge-rim cups decorated with floral motifs (255, 256, fig. 4.24: 1-2). The flat and circular pyxis lids attest the existence of two decorated examples of the cylindrical type without handles, a common LM IIIA shape (255, 256, fig. 4.24: 3, 6).78 The elaborate decoration of irises on 258 and pendant festoons with multiple arcs on 257 date these to LM IIIAi (fig. 4.24: 3, 4.24: 6). Popham noted the lack of body fragments amongst the material from Evans's excavations and suggested that these lids may have accompanied plain versions.79 However, in tomb contexts, where pyxides are regularly deposited, sometimes containing jewellery,80 the lid always accompanies a decorated body.81 A LM IIIAi date can be also assigned to the upper body of a small stirrup jar with barred handles, rows of dots on its false spout and iris buds as upper body decoration (259, fig. 4.24: 4). Other contemporary vessels are the upper body of a fine jug (260, fig. 4.24: 7) decorated with LM IIIAi running spirals and rim fragments of a Palace Style jar decorated with alternating arcs (261, fig. 4.24: 9). The lower body of a coarse vessel in a red clay (265, fig. 4.24: 8), a LM III type conical cup (264, fig. 4.24: 10) and a large clay drain complete the assemblage. Finally, there is also a fragmentary 'skirt' belonging to a female figurine in a fine green-white LM IIIAi type clay (262, fig. 4.24: 5). The very fragmentary LM IIIC krater depicting a goat and bird, the latter smelling flowers, has to be considered intrusive (263, plate 12 a). P. I. 5 represents the contents of the blocked Corridor 18, where according to Evans's list five sealings were discovered (figs. 4.4: 6-9, 4.5, 4.6: 1). Several fairly complete LM IIIA1/2 cups belong here such as a ledge-rim version with Minoan flowers (30, fig. 4.4: 7), the fairly complete LM IIIA2 type with a frieze of stylised chevrons (36, fig. 4.5: 1) and the version with alternating arcs and the unusual plain interior (31, fig. 4.4: 9). Amongst other shapes are a LM IIIAi type bowl (29, fig. 4.4: 6), two kylikes (32, 46, fig. 4.5: 4-5) and a piriform jar decorated with alternating V's and a row of iris buds (33, fig. 4.5: 2). The fabric of a miniature jug looks LM IIIA (38, fig. 4.5: 14). Finally, two spouted jugs date to LM IIIAi; one has a net pattern (35, fig. 4.5: 9), whereas the second an elaborate decoration of foliate band followed by interlocking spirals (34, fig. 4.5: 3). Three conical cups are of the general LM III type whereas the fragmentary large coarse basin with wavy band decoration stylistically belongs to the LM IIIA horizon (47, fig. 4.6: 1). However, later pottery is also found, including a LM IIIA2 cup type decorated with alternating arcs (37, fig. 4.4: 8), two large LM IIIA2 type kylikes (39, 40, fig. 4.5: 11-12) and a LM IIIB shallow bowl kylix with high swung handles (41, FIG. 4.5: 13). Another area rich in LM IIIA 1/2 pottery and especially decorated cups was the SW Sector, represented by the pottery kept in the boxes labelled P. I. 12 (figs. 4.15-4.16). 78 For the development of shape and decoration: Alexiou 1954; Kanta 1980, 281-2.

Og Last, but not least, reference should be made to the deposits reported by the excavators in some detail, namely the group of vessels from the area of Staircase 34 and the Magazines (Rooms 28-30). Mackenzie marked the find-spot of the clay bull's head rhyton (339, fig. 4.32: 3) along the E end of the upper flight of Staircase 34. Although he omitted any reference to the squat alabastron (337, fig. 4.32: 6) and the Marine Style tall alabastron (336, fig. 4.32: 1), Evans explicitly associates them with the clay bull's head rhyton.82 All seem either to have been stored under the sottoscala of Staircase 34 or to have fallen from the upper floor. The Marine Style alabastron is obviously an heirloom and has been discussed under the LM IB pottery. The squat alabastron is known from Knossian settlement contexts such as the famous stone versions found on the floors of the Throne Room in the Palace.83 However, very few versions in clay have come to light from Knossos town. The LM II deposits of the MUM produced only two such vases, whereas amongst Evans's excavations two are known from the LP and a third one from the Area of the Fish Fresco.84 By contrast, the shape seem to have been a popular tomb offering within the Knossos area between LM II and LM IIIAi, though completely falling out of fashion in the succeeding periods.85 The LP squat alabastron (337, fig. 4.32: 6) has been dated by Popham to LM IIIA. Of local clay, this rather small version has a rock pattern decoration, which resembles its mainland counterparts,86 as well as a LM II version from the Warrior Tomb near Isopata and the fragmentary LM IIIAi alabastron from the Area of the Fish Fresco.87 No other type of LM III alabastra is present amongst the LP material. The clay bull's head rhyton was found fragmentary, missing much of its front, including ears, forehead, nose and mouth. Its unique character complicates dating. Certain features such as the vessel's well polished surface, its buff clay and slip together with the rich brown paint belong to LM IIIAi rather than LM II vessels. The roll handle, which is outlined and barred, is closer to LM II rather than LM IIIAi characteristics. The 'rock pattern' decoration, the filling material of figure-of-eight shields and dots are common on LM II and LM IIIAi squat alabastra. Finally the elaborate floral motif on its underside resembles stylised LM IIIA versions of Palace Style jars. The horizontal chevrons used as filling material again resemble LM II but also LM IIIAi prototypes. The scattered distribution of the so-called ewer or 'gourd-vase' in Rooms 28-29 also implies an upper floor collapse (336, fig. 4.32: 2).88 Two more vases are reported from the region of Room 30 and the space for the upper flight of Staircase 34: The 'amphora with net (shoulder) design' can be identified with a fragmentary piriform jar with network pattern (84, fig. 4.32: 4), whereas the 'jar with papyrus (rim)' fits the description of the Palace Style Jar, fragments of which were also found outside the LP in the area of the S Court (340, fig. 4.32: 5). The ewer belongs to a distinct type of jug with elaborate decoration and relief work, which Evans compared in technique to the relief decoration applied on the LM IIIAi Palace Style pithoid jar from the Royal Villa.89 However, the Katsambas tombs have added more comparative material, namely the jug from Tomb B.90 Both vessels not only have similar dimensions and shape, but their surfaces are divided by relief work in like manner: under the neck is a horizontal moulding, below which the body is divided into eight vertical zones of uneven widths. Both have relief decoration on the neck and below the spout, but on the whole the Katsambas jug is more ornate with its projecting nipples, whereas the LP example differs in having part of its decoration, namely the 'knots', also in relief. On the LP ewer (336, fig. 4.32: 2), quirks have been used extensively as a filling material, a practice common on LM II but also LM IIIAi closed shape vessels. Marinatos has suggested that the zigzag decoration on the LP vessel imitates glasswork, again a feature which finds parallels in LM II but also LM IIIAi.91 Three more very fragmentary vases of this type can be added, namely body fragments from a LM IIIAi context from the SEX site at Knossos, the neck of one found in Phaistos and a body fragment of another from Chania.92 A vase similar in shape to the LP one is depicted on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus, thus 82 Evans 1914, 72-3, 87. 83 PM IV, 939 fig. 910; Popham 19700, 77; Warren 1969, 4- 6; more recently Arbin 1984; Magrill 1987 and Waterhouse 1 q8 8 ; Warren 1 qq 1 d, %%. 84 MUM, 173-4 pls- 66 a~b&gt; !54-2.

The piriform jar (84, fig. 4.32: 4) with network decorations shares LM II and LM IIIAi decorative features such as the quirk and the pendant lily motif hanging from its strap handles. The latter finds good parallels amongst the LM II decorated kylikes. The papyrus Palace Style jar was extensively reconstructed by Evans (340, fig. 4.32: 5).93 It was correctly given a piriform body, although its neck may have been slightly shorter than reconstructed. The floral decoration consists of highly stylised papyrus, a common theme on these elaborately decorated vases dating to LM IIIAi rather than LM II.94 In conclusion, although almost every vessel described bears strong LM II stylistic characteristics, a LM IIIAi date is more likely for this assemblage. Upper floor collapse is the most plausible explanation for the distribution of these vessels along the ground floor rooms in the area of the Magazines and Staircase 34. Stylistic Analysis Any analysis of the large quantities of LM IIIA1/2 material can only start with the decorated cup, a shape that by far outnumbers all others amongst the LP material. In form the main LM IIIAi cup (Popham's type A) is less 'bulbous' and shallower than its LM II predecessor.95 Its average height can be estimated at about 8 cm whereas the diameter can range from 14 to 16 cm. A hallmark of the period is the distinctive sharp 'ledge' and out-turned rim, with a thin strap handle and flat base, although less well executed examples lack the sharply defined rim (compare figs. 4.15: 5 and 4.16: 1). Usually set at a right angle to the position of the handle, the rim has been pulled out to form a pouring spout. The cup's interior is painted all over, either with sponge-print, which seems to be a LM II survival, monochrome or infrequently plain.96 The handle has two bands of vertical strokes on either edge, the middle being left plain. On the exterior, the main zone of decoration is set between the lip band and a group of three to four narrow bands, set at about two thirds down the body. The base is outlined with one thick and sometimes one or two thin bands just above. Another LM II hangover is the row of dots, quirks, wavy lines or V pattern applied below the lip band and above the main decoration.97 Sometimes the main frieze is set between single or double undulating lines.98 The variety of decorative motifs on the cup is extensive during this period. Most common are festoon patterns with irises or pendants, stacked V's, alternating arcs, zigzags and stylised floral motifs arranged in chains. Less common are the network and the reed, the latter being a LM II survival, which rapidly falls out of fashion and does not continue into the next phase. The second shape present in this group, with only a few examples, is the shallow cup (Popham's type C)99, which imitates metal prototypes and corresponds to the Mycenaean cup FS 219 (fig. 4.3: 12).100 Its height ranges between 3.5 and 4 cm, whereas its diameter is between 10 and 11 cm. Like the ordinary cup it too has an out-turned rim and a strap handle, but can have either a flat or a ring base. Its interior can be monochrome (fig. 4.15: 14), or left plain apart from a rim and several thin bands along the body (figs. 4.15: 13, 4.15: 1 1, 4.26: 5). It can also have an incised circle or impressed disc inside the base. On the exterior, the main decorative zone is set between bands in a similar manner to other cup types. Although the typically Mycenaean motif of running spirals is quite common on this shape (fig. 4.3: 12), a variety of Minoan patterns, such as foliate bands (fig. 4.8: 8), rows of iris buds (figs. 4.8: 7, 4.26: 6) and alternating arcs (fig. 4.15: 13-14), were applied as well. Fragments of LM IIIAi plain kylikes have been identified amongst the sherd material (figs. 4.1: 18, 4.5: 4, 4.6: 12, 4.6: 14, 4.13: 1). The decorated version is absent from the LP, which is not accidental given that it is rare during this period. The LM IIIAi kylix, which resembles its Mycenaean counterpart FS 264, has a sharp everted or ledge rim, similar to that applied on the cup, thin strap handles and a rounded body, which forms a characteristic S-curve. The bowl tends to be differentiated from the stem, which is pierced to assist firing. !&gt;s PM II, 540; PM IV, 328 fig. 269. 94 For papyrus on Palace Style jars: Popham 19700, pl. 5 a-c (vases from the n.n.w. area of the Palace, the N.

Amongst the P. I. boxes there are fragments of at least three more Palace Style jars, apart from the published one with papyrus decoration discussed above (340), all too fragmentary for reconstruction (figs. 4.16: 6, 4.24: 9, 4.30: 4). The best has a large part of its base, rim and neck preserved though its body fragments are scrappy (334, fig. 4.30: 4). This vessel had a floral decoration filled in with sponge pattern and was probably similar to the Palace Style jars from the N. W. House and the MUM.102 The application of the sponge pattern dates this example to either LM II or LM IIIAi. Decorated jugs have been identified, but these are too fragmentary to be reconstructed. Since the decorative zone on this type of vessel is reserved for the upper body, less than 1/3 of each has been preserved. However, the shape, which remains roughly the same for decorated and plain jugs, is well known from complete examples found in both settlement and tombs.103 The shape is piriform, with a characteristic moulding near the neck, which can be long and up-tilted or cut away (funnel). A usually ovoid handle starts from the lip.104 With the decoration reserved to the upper body, the remaining space is banded.105 Various motifs are represented amongst the LP examples, such as running spirals (260, fig. 4.24: 7), alternating Minoan flowers (330, plate 21 ¿/), plus a unique example with a bird amongst flowers (249, fig. 4.23: 6). Furthermore, two fragmentary miniature jugs have been identified (38, fig. 4.5: 14 and 247, fig. 4.23: 12). Another variety is the spouted jar with two elaborately decorated examples, one with foliate bands followed by floral motifs (34, fig. 4.5: 3) and the other with a network pattern (35, fig. 4.5: 9). Amongst the more fragmentary examples 199 is decorated with Minoan flowers and 200 with foliate scroll (fig. 4.20: 9-10). There is a difficulty in assigning body sherds to piriform jars rather than to the jug, when diagnostic features, such as the three handles vertical to the body, are missing.106 Nonetheless, several fragmentary piriform jars have been identified, all of which have a characteristic moulding between the neck and upper body.107 An additional diagnostic feature, for distinguishing piriform jars from jugs, might be the length of the decoration zone which tends to be much taller, occupying up to 2/3 of the vessel's body. According to their decoration all LP piriform jars can be dated stylistically to LM IIIAi. The elaborate pendant lily below the handle of 84 (fig. 4.32: 4) resembles LM II decorative motifs below the handles of goblets.108 An elaborate version has pendant foliate bands with festoons and multiple arcs (329, plate 21 d). Furthermore the zigzag with alternating V's followed by either iris buds or quirks and dots are typical of LM IIIAi Knossos. Stirrup jars are rare amongst the selected material, probably because the majority of vessels were plain, with only one or two fragmentary decorated examples preserved (178, fig. 4.16: 7 and 259, fig. 4.24: 4). Although of semi-fine fabric 178 (fig. 4.16: 7) must have had an elaborate shoulder and body decoration,109 whereas the design applied to the false spout and handle can be compared with several Knossos examples, dating to LM IIIAi or early LM IIIA2.110 The fragments on plate 19 b can be identified with an amphoroid krater (333). The form of the base of the handles suggests that metal prototypes were often imitated. The main decorative motif, of stacked V's, closely resembles the amphoroid krater from the 8th Magazine and the South Propyleum in the Palace, and an alabastron from the LM II-IIIAi tomb near the Temple Tomb.111 Apart from the two pyxis lids in P. I. 16 (fig. 4.24: 3 and 6) there are fragments of a LM IIIA1/2 cylindrical pyxis, decorated with stacked V's (plate 19c). The most elaborately decorated example is 327 (fig. 4.31: 1), which survives in a rather fragmentary condition. This large pyxis was decorated with a variety of themes, such as floral arrangements, horns of consecration, birds 'smelling' flowers 101 Popham 19700, 101 fig. 7 especially strainer no. 15.

The vessel belongs to a well-known series of pyxides with ornate decoration set in panels. Birds and flowers were a favourite motif for pyxides in both LM II and LM IIIAi, where decoration usually runs continuously around the vessel's body.112 The reed motif resembles LM II versions such as the large floral designs, which parallel LM II decorative themes on goblets. Birds are a popular pyxis motif in LM IIIAi and remain so in LM IIIA2 such as on the Pachyammos and Palaikastro examples.113 A LM IIIA1/2 date can be assigned to the LP version. 328 (fig. 4.30: 2 and 6) is a large basin, with a flat base, straight-sided walls and ledge rim. The interior was left plain, apart from the base, which was decorated with a flower, and a frieze of alternating arcs on its rim.114 Although there is one coarse ware basin from the LM II destruction deposits in MUM and several from LM IIIA2 to LM IIIB levels at Kommos, the decoration applied on the LP basin is unique.115 The flower motif finds good parallels on both LM II and LM IIIA pottery and frescoes, whereas the alternating arcs on the rim point to a LM IIIA1/2 date.116 Fragments of at least eight conical rhyta have been identified,117 most of which come from P. I. 12 and P. I. 14. The conical type is the only rhyton shape which survives into LM III.118 Decoration, depending on the motif, can be either arranged in rows or may occupy a larger part of the body such as with the octopus where its tentacles are arranged around the body of the vessel.119 248 (fig. 4.23: 13) is a fine LM IIIAi example, with a series of foliate bands.120 Alternating arcs are another common motif, which continues into LM IIIA2, such as on 319 (fig. 4.29: 1 1).121 Fragments of decorated fenestrated stands are noteworthy; 70 (fig. 4.9: 4) with its foliate band clearly dates to LM IIIAi, whereas 71 (fig. 4.9: 5) and 213 (fig. 4.21: 12) more generally to LM IIIA. The sparse remains of a LM IIIA pithos, of local clay, elaborately decorated with bands of foliate scrolls are interesting for the white bands and row of dots added below the handle decoration (300, fig. 4.27: 8). LM IIIA2 Although amongst the decorated pottery LM IIIA2 forms the smallest ceramic group from the LP, P. I. 4 and P. I. 6 contain considerable quantities of such plain pottery together with LM IIIA 1/2 material. A similar pattern is observed in P. I. 15 where LM IIIA 1/2 is well mixed with LM IIIA2 pottery. Finally P. I. 11 stands alone, since mainly consisting of complete vessels. Potential 'Deposits' A fairly homogeneous group of material comes from the space below the upper flight of Staircase 32, P. I. 15 (fig. 4.23). It is worth noting that Mackenzie marked deposits of sealings along both the lower and upper flights of Staircase 32, whereas Evans listed a total of eight sealings. Apart from a few LM IIIB type sherds this box contains exclusively LM IIIA 1/2 and LM IIIA2 pottery. Amongst the earliest vessels are five LM IIIA 1/2 type ledge-rim cups. 245 is decorated with a net pattern (fig. 4.23: 14), 243 with stacked V's and iris buds (fig. 4.23: 10), 242 with undulating lines and festoons (fig. 4.23: 1), 246 with alternating arcs (fig. 4.23: 15), whereas 244 has a plain interior and exterior decoration of festoons and iris buds (fig. 4.23: 11). The conical rhyton decorated with an elaborate version of the foliate band (248, fig. 4.23: 13) and the miniature jug (247, fig. 4.23: 12) with a similar motif of foliate band and quirks, also date to LM IIIAi . The upper body of a fine jug decorated with a bird also finds good parallels in LM II and LM IIIAi Knossos (249, fig. 4.23: 6).122 The LM IIIA2 material includes a complete champagne cup with shallow underside (252, fig. 4.23: 8), plus the similar foot of a second (253, fig. 4.23: 5), a rim fragment of a plain coarse pyxis (245, fig. 4.23: 9), the base of a footed cup (250, fig. 4.23: 7), the rim of a spouted cup (251, fig. 4.23: 16) and the stray 112 Elliptical pyxis from MUM: MUM, pls. 65 b, 155.1.

Interestingly, most of the LM IIIA1/2 and LM IIIA2 material has a grey rather than a buff colour clay, which surely has to be attributed to discoloration by fire. The co-existence of decorated LM IIIA1/2 together with plain pottery stylistically assigned to LM IIIA2, most of which have acquired a grey colour due to the effects of fire, is not accidental. Therefore, P. I. 15 is a crucial box for dating the LP fire destruction. The provenance of P. I. 11 is not easy to establish, but the two different references given on the label and box might suggest the area of Room 36. The decorative zone of the coarse ware globular stirrup jar is filled with Minoan flowers, whereas its thin-thick body bands provide a LM IIIA2 date (130, fig. 4.13: 4). This vessel is accompanied by an ovoid-shaped amphora in a local coarse fabric, decorated with two rows of 'octopus decoration' (131, fig. 4.13: 5). The fragmentary decorated kylix belongs to the large LM IIIA2 version (128, fig. 4.13: 2). Although the octopus decoration on the amphora suggests an advanced date, it is quite possible to date this assemblage, which may represent a floor deposit, to LM IIIA2. P. I. 6, amongst the most interesting but difficult to date boxes, is attributed to Room 20, which according to Evans's list produced five clay sealings (figs. 4.6: 2-20 and 4.7). It is the only LP box which contains almost exclusively plain LM III pottery. The early LM IIIÁ2 type champagne cup with a hollow underside was reconstructed complete from sherds with old breaks. It may suggest that the contents of these two boxes are intact and must represent some kind of a deposit (51, fig. 4.6: 2). Most of the pottery is fragmentary, but the following shapes predominate: LM IIIAi type kylix feet (figs. 4.6: 21, 4.6: 24, 4.6: 26) and early LM IIIA2 type champagne cup feet (figs. 4.6: 23, 4.6: 25), LM IIIA1/2 type ledge rims of plain cups, kylikes or shallow bowls (figs. 4.5-4.11). Fragmentary tripod cooking pots and cooking dishes, which are nevertheless difficult to date (figs. 4.7: 3-4, 4.7: 13-14, 4.7: 16). The flaring rim of the tripod cooking pots might be a LM III feature continuing unchanged from LM II (figs. 4.7: 8-10, 4.8: 15).123 The upper body of a coarse two-handled amphora, in a deep red fabric with added white linear decoration applied on the vessel's untreated surface, resembles the LM IIIA2 stirrup jar with white decoration from the SEX site (55, fig. 4.6: 20). As a result a LM IIIA2 date is probable for this group of material. The upper body of a plain LM IIIB type kylix (54, fig. 4.7: 2) and the fine decorated sherd of a LM IIIC stirrup jar with octopus decoration (fig. 4.6: 19) shall have to be considered intrusive. Another puzzling group of pottery comes from P. I. 4, identified with Room 22, which according to Evans's list produced only one sealing from its E end. Part of the contents of P. I. 4 have been already discussed since the group of plain cups which Mackenzie dated to LM III are in reality LM IA type conical cups. Amongst the remaining LM III pottery predominant are large quantities of fine plain or coarse wares. To begin with the decorated pottery: a peculiar LM IIIAi rhyton fragment has an exterior decoration of double axes set between very stylised horns of consecration and a sponge painted interior (15, fig. 4.3: 15). 124 A LM IIIAi bowl with a frieze of irises (12, fig. 4.3: 11) and a ledge-rim cup decorated with zigzags and stacked V's (13, fig. 4.3: 13) are the only decorated specimens with more than one rim fragment preserved. The remaining pottery is more difficult to date. The plain shallow bowl (21, fig. 4.3: 20) and ladle (28, fig. 4.3: 19) could date to either LM IIIA2 or LM IIIB, since these shapes do not seem to have a great development from one period to the other (fig. 4.3: 19-20). Equally unhelpful is a small LM III semi-coarse plain juglet, discoloured grey from fire. Finally there are four very fragmentary coarse stirrup jars. All have the usual dark-on-light linear decoration with interlocking spiral on the false spout; one has horizontal bands on the handles. Since their linear decoration resembles the dark-on-light stirrup jar from the SEX site and the Katsambas Tomb H stirrup jars, a LM IIIA2 date is probable.125 In such a case the rim fragment of a deep bowl decorated with Minoan flowers and dated to an advanced stage of LM IIIB has to be considered intrusive, whereas the LM IIIA2 cup rim fragments (16-17, fig. 4.3: 16-17.) could have been contemporary with the stirrup jars. It should be added that stirrup jar fragments 24 and 25 are heavily discoloured grey by fire (figs. 4.4: 3 and 5). Stylistic Analysis From the early stages of LM IIIA2 the decorated cup exhibits a decline in standard from that of its LM IIIAi predecessor. It can be less well potted, with thicker walls, heavier burnishing and sometimes 123 Compare to LM II tripod cooking pots with a distinct flaring rim from the MUM: MUM, pl. 162.9-1 1. 124 Strangely, the closest parallel in shape is a LM IIIC sherd from Kavousi-Kastro: Mook and Coulson iqq7, c'aa fis. 8 a. 125 Warren 1997, 168 fig. 20; Alexiou 196*7, pl. 25 b.</page><page sequence="124">i ! 4 THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY painted in a more careless manner (fig. 4.17: 1-2).126 This change can be observed from the earliest stages of the period. The sharply defined LM IIIAi ledge rim has practically disappeared, being replaced by a flat-top rim. The body is deeper, but less rounded and more vertical in profile (fig. 4.12: 1). The handle becomes ovoid in section, though the base remains flat. The interior is almost universally monochrome as the sponge pattern has fallen out of fashion. The rim band tends to become thicker as the period progresses, and the kinds of decoration changes too. The number of body bands below and above the main decoration zone, which format becomes a standard diagnostic feature. In the early phase of LM IIIA2 the three to four thin bands below the decoration do continue and the base remains outlined (figs. 4.5: 1, 4.16: 4-5). Together with the decrease in the quality of pot making, the variety of motifs applied on the main decorative zone is reduced as well. Most popular now are the alternating arcs and stacked V's, with festoon patterns, zigzags and foliate scroll. As the period advances the cup acquires thicker walls and heavier polishing (fig. 4.3: 16-17). The lip becomes undifferentiated from the body, which becomes deeper and rather vertical in profile. Body bands become a diagnostic feature; since the three or four thin bands so common in LM IIIA2 are now replaced by the 'thin-thick bands' combination (figs. 4.9: 8, 4.10: 9, 4.20: 11-13). Sometimes this arrangement is abbreviated into two thick bands, a feature which continues into LM IIIB. Decorative motifs tend to be more schematic and sometimes are painted with a thicker brush. Amongst the LM IIIA2 material noteworthy is a cup, which has a more rounded body and a plain interior apart from a lip band (figs. 4.17: 3, 4.21: 2, 4.26: 7). It probably had a ring base.127 Most popular amongst the decorative themes are alternating arcs, running spirals, quirks, foliate scrolls and stacked V's in various arrangements. A thin line set below the rim band separates it from the decorative frieze, a feature exclusive to this period.128 Although the development of the kylix has been traced by Popham and recently by Hallager, the features of those types belonging to the LM IIIA2 Palace destruction horizon remain less well defined.129 A similar problem applies to the champagne cup, a popular shape that appears in LM IIIA2.130 Early versions have a characteristically low hollow foot, a slightly out-turned lip and a handle which is ovoid in section (fig. 4.6: 2).131 Of the two complete LM IIIA2 types, 252 is unusual in having a wider than normal rim; its hollow underside, however, conforms to the LM IIIA2 typology (fig. 4.23: 8). The LM IIIA2 loop-handled kylix is named after its ovoid or roll projecting handles, which sometimes rise above the level of the rim, though less so than the LM IIIB version of the shallow kylix (figs. 4.19: 3, 417* 8).132 The bowl can be deep and rounded or sometimes conical; however, it is not differentiated from the stem as sharply as the subsequent LM IIIB shallow bowl kylix version. Compared with its LM IIIAi predecessor there is a tendency to produce large vessels, sometimes 20 cm high, which required a large arched foot for support. Kylix 83 (fig 4.10: 6) is probably an early version with an ovoid handle and rather conical body. Kylikes 128 (fig. 4.13: 2) and 214 (fig. 4.21: 7) are large decorated versions, which should be assigned to an advanced stage of LM IIIA2. There is only one monochrome version with a well-polished surface and a pierced stem (32, fig. 4.5: 5), whereas 166 (fig. 4.17: 14) has a monochrome interior but plain exterior save for a thin rim band. Finally 106 (fig. 4.10: 17) is of the large variety with a deep bowl with a slightly everted rim. The foot of a large kylix has a solid rather than the usual pierced stem (fig. 4.6: 16), a feature also present in a plain small kylix (fig. 4.12: 6), dated by Popham to LM IIIB. Both examples are not imports since manufactured out of a fine buff Knossian clay. Several fragmentary plain pyxides are preserved, with a cylindrical body and sets of antithetically placed holes, presumably to fasten a lid to the pyxis body (figs. 4.10: 13-16, 4.23: 9). Fine and semi- coarse examples exist amongst the LP material, all of which have plain, smoothed surfaces. For 110 (fig. 4.10: 14), of which there is a complete rim and upper body, it is presumed that this type of pyxis was handleless. None of the lids or bases survive, but the shape can be reconstructed with a flat base from the few published examples from Archanes and Mallia. The Archanes and Mallia House E pyxides date to LM IIIB, whereas one from a chamber tomb at Adele near Rethymnon dates to LM 12(i The characteristics of the LM IIIA2 decorated cup have been outlined by several authors: Popham 19700, 68-9; Kanta 1980, 266; MUM, 182; Warren and Hankey 1989, 86; Watrous 1992, 130-1.

Popham 1969, 301. The shape resembles a metal cup from a LM II-IIIAi tomb south of the Temple Tomb: Hutchinson 19560, 72 fig. 3.14. At Kommos, however, the vase shape is already present amongst the LM IIIA1/2 deposits: Watrous 1992, 132. 131 MUM, 183, pl. 176.10-14. 132 Hallager 1997, 28.</page><page sequence="125">THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY ! 1 5 IIIA/B.133 Furthermore, a rim fragment of a plain pyxis in a semi-coarse buff local fabric is found amongst the sherds kept from Pit 8 in Room C in the MUM, which date to LM IIIA2. There seems to be no noticeable development in the shape from LM IIIA2 to LM IIIB, thus a more secure date from the LP examples should be provided by associated pottery groups. The plain pyxis 254 (fig. 4.23: 9) from P. I. 15 should date to LM IIIA2, whereas all remaining examples from P. I. 8 could date to LM IIIB (fig. 4.10: 13-16). LM IIIB P. I. 9 and P. I. GEN. #1458 contain only fairly complete pottery and not the usual mixture of LM IIIA and LM IIIB rim sherds. P. I. 12 also contains two fairly complete vases. However, the bulk of the LM IIIB late decorated rim sherds, which were published by Popham, come from P. I. 8 and P. I. 14. It is impossible to correlate stratigraphically the quantities of LM IIIB late decorated sherds, found in most of the LP boxes, with the contents of P. I. 9 and P. I. GEN. #1458. A significant difference between the LM IIIA and LM IIIB decorated pottery is that amongst the latter group there are very few cross-joins (fig. 4.31: 4-6). This observation implies a different stratigraphical situation at least between the LM IIIA and LM IIIB late decorated material. Potential 'Deposits' Unlike all other boxes labelled P. I. GEN., #1458 contained only complete LM IIIB vases (fig. 4.28). It is unfortunate, however, that the provenance of this box, which must represent a floor deposit, remains unknown. The coarse-ware octopus stirrup jar (305, fig. 4.28: 5, plate 21c) provides a LM IIIB date for this assemblage.134 The two fragmentary champagne cups have a rather shallow bowl and ovoid handles (302, 303, fig. 4.28: 2-3). Although their foot is missing, their underside looks like the shallow variety; a LM IIIA2 date could be assigned to these vessels. The ladle has a shape similar to that of the shallow cup, but is equipped with the characteristic high loop handle (304, fig. 4.28: 4). The body is pierced through at the point where the handle joins the body, presumably to assist in firing. Since no other P. I. GEN. box contained any complete pottery, it is quite possible that the collared jug and the side-spouted cup, which derived from P. I. GEN. boxes were part of this assemblage (fig. 4.27: 9-10). The side-spouted cup is not well known from domestic deposits, but is a regular offering within tombs and can occur in several variations (306, fig. 4.27: 10).135 Despite its ledge-like rim, the shape occurs in the LM IIIB tombs VI and VII at the Upper Gypsades cemetery, but not amongst earlier LM II or LM IIIIA1/2 tombs in the Knossos region.136 The shape, however, does not seem to present distinct variations from LM IIIA2 to LM IIIB. The collared jug is a shape without many parallels from this period (307, fig. 4.27: 9). The form appears in the LM III deposits from the MUM, but clearly these are earlier than the LP vase.137 The jug from Kommos Deposit 27, dated to LM IIIAi, despite its plain decoration of simple bands is undoubtedly earlier, since it has a ledge rim and a thick strap handle. A LM IIIA2 jug from Karpathos is closer in shape to the LP one.138 Its upper body is decorated with festoons, whilst the body bands are of the 'thin-thick' variety. However, the closest parallel comes from a domestic deposit at Knossos, namely the jug from the LM III 'Kitchen' at Makriteichos.139 Although the body of the Makriteichos jug is more globular and the decoration of a wavy band along the upper body is slightly more elaborate, it is otherwise very similar to the LP vessel. Finally, the LM IIIC jugs from the Kephala Tholos Tomb at Knossos, although having a comparable wavy band on the upper body, lack the pronounced spout and certainly look more advanced in date.140 A second group of fairly complete vases comes from the area w or nw of Staircase 32 (P. I. 9). The earliest vessel is a LM IIIA2 type large cup with vertical sides; thin-thick body bands and a decorative motif of zigzags filled with densely applied stacked V's (114, fig. 4.12: 1). A small Chaniot cup decorated with antithetic V's and bivalves dates to LM IIIBi in the local Chaniot ceramic sequence (115, fig. 133 Andrikou 1995, 15-17 fig- 2.A88. 134 The stylised or rather linear version of the octopus motif on coarse-ware stirrup jars becomes a hallmark of LM IIIA2 and LM IIIB, but as Haskell notes it is often difficult to date them more closely: Haskell 1981, 180. Also Kanta 1980, 252-4. 135 Catling 1968, 129-30 fig. 9.37 for references. 136 Hood, Huxley and Sanders 1958-9, 225, 242 fig. 28 VI. 1 and VII. 10. 137 MUM, pls. 62-3. 138 Melas 1985, pl. 110.23. 139 Hood and de Jong 1958-9, fig. 6.8 pl. 47 b. The deposit dates to LM IIIA2/LM IIIB based on the champagne cup bases (ibid. 187 fig. 3.3-8), the kylikes (ibid. 189 figs. 1-2) and the spouted cylindrical jar with the typical advanced LM IIIA2 'thin- thick' body bands (ibid. ìqo fig. 6.7). 140 Cadogan 1967, 262 fig. 3, pl. 48.6.</page><page sequence="126">! 1 6 THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY 4.12: 2).141 Unlike most Knossian versions it has a plain interior, a feature also present amongst other Chaniot LM IIIBi cups and bowls.142 A small decorated cup with an S-profile, a slightly flaring rim and flat base is decorated with a classic LM IIIB motif, multiple stem spirals (116, fig. 4.12: 3). Two champagne cups are of the deep underfoot variety which also dates to LM IIIB (117, 118, fig. 4.12: 5, 4.12: 12). During LM IIIB the vase has an undefined rim and a rounder body with a roll handle. The body stands on a much flatter foot, whereas the underside hole is deep and well defined.143 Champagne cup 120 (fig. 4.12: 4) has a rather unusual shape, which finds an exact monochrome parallel from a LM IIIA2 level at Kommos.144 The small kylix 119 with a roll handle and solid foot, made of local clay remains a shape without exact parallels from Crete (fig. 4.12: 6).145 The plain shallow cup seems not to develop much from LM IIIA2 onwards; 121 and 122 have ovoid handles (fig. 4.12: 1 1, 4.12: 13), but are better compared to IIIB examples from the Palace rather than earlier IIIA plain cups from Knossos and Kommos.146 A group of four conical cups, including three miniature versions have to be dated according to the remaining vases of the assemblage (fig. 4.12: 7-10). P. I. 12 contained a fairly complete stirrup jar with a decoration of hatched triangles (180, fig. 4.19: 1). Such decoration is common on both LM IIIA2 and LM IIIB stirrup jars, including examples from Stamnoi, Episkopi Pediados and Episkopi Ierapetras.147 The LP example, possibly an import with its brownish semi-fine fabric, bears strong burning marks on its interior and exterior. The spouted bowl is a LM IIIB Chaniot import with only a few parallels (175, fig. 4.19: 2).148 P. I. 12 also contained a few fragmentary LM IIIB pottery, which could have formed some sort of a LM IIIB late deposit along the SW Sector of the LP (fig. 4.18). Stylistic Analysis of the LM IIIB Pottery149 Since LM IIIB cups and bowls regularly have the same profiles and comparable rim diameters, their handles remain the determining factor for distinguishing shapes. With the total absence of handles amongst the LP material it is often difficult to assign sherds to one or the other shape.150 Considerable advances in defining the development of the deep bowl in LM IIIB Knossos have been made by Warren's study of the SEX material.151 Warren has isolated a deep bowl type with an upright instead of an incurving profile, the latter typical of LM IIIA2 deep bowls.152 Since the upright profile bowl is similar in shape and often decoration to the LM IIIA2 cup, the horizontal handles become the determining factor for assigning such profiles to the LM IIIB bowl rather than the LM IIIA2 large cup. A further distinction is made between the upright profile deep bowl, which Warren considers a marker for LM IIIB, and the bowl type with a bell-like profile and bow shaped handles set quite high, which he dates to LM IIIC.153 Kanta has demonstrated that the LM IIIB late bowl type develops from the LM IIIA2 Minoan version and not the Mycenaean FS 284.154 Consequently, the following observations can be made regarding the LP decorated sherd material, i) None of the four LP examples where a bowl handle is preserved, belongs to Warren's LM IIIB bowl type with the upright profile. 275 (fig. 4.25: 9) with its rather straight profile and a high set handle could be LM IIIC. Deep bowl 288 (fig. 4.26: 8) has an S-shape profile, whereas 293 (fig. 4.26: 11) and 326 (fig. 4.31: 6) have a straight-sided profile with a slightly flaring rim. None of them resembles in proportions the bell- shaped profile of the mainland version FS 284. ii) Amongst the LP rim sherds very few indeed qualify for the SEX LM IIIB type straight-sided bowl.155 This might imply a chronological differentiation 141 M.

Cups, however, usually have a single rather than a double line below the decoration zone (figs. 4.22: 14, 4.26: 18). 161 The interior of the cup is almost universally monochrome, with the main decoration framed between a single thick lip band and a similar body one. The flat or slightly raised base is outlined by one band as well. The decorated deep bowl, with two horizontal roll handles, becomes the hallmark of the period (figs. 4.26: 8, 4.26: 11, 4.31: 6).162 The shape clearly derives from the LM IIIA2 deep cup. It does not resemble its Mycenaean counterpart FS 284 either in shape, proportions or arrangement of decoration. The Minoan version tends to be shallower and usually lacks the ring foot. In profile, the LP rim sherds are rather straight-sided but have a distinct flaring rim. Alternatively and like the comparable cup, they can have a rather S-shaped profile. At Knossos the bowl interior is almost universally monochrome, whereas on the exterior the arrangement of bands and decoration is similar to the cup, only that the latter is usually followed by two bands. Special reference should be made to bowl or cup versions with a plain interior and a single or double rim band.163 Another variation has a monochrome interior, which leaves an interior rim band in buff. (fig. 4.26: 9). Both decorative schemes should be considered Minoan and not confused with the Mycenaean reserved band.164 The shallow kylix is represented by decorated and plain versions, with complete and several fragmentary vases.165 In LM IIIB, the vessel has acquired a shallow rounded bowl, usually without a pronounced lip.166 The roll handles rise above the body, which in turn is clearly differentiated from the stem. There is a second version where the roll handles do not rise beyond rim level. The foot can be either arched or flat. In all LP examples the foot is missing, but in the two recomposed kylikes this has been reconstructed with an arched foot, based on a kylix from the Milatos tomb.167 The interior is universally monochrome and the main decoration is framed between the rim and usually two thin body bands. The LP examples are decorated with multiple stem spirals, alternating arcs with opposite loops as filling material, wavy band and spray pattern, all of which are motifs popular on contemporary cups and bowls. Another popular motif is the whorl shell, amongst the LP material represented by very fragmentary kylix sherds (fig. 4.18: 10, 4.18: 12). Decorative motifs are common for cups, bowls and kylikes.168 Popular are the alternating arcs with loops or bivalves as filling material (figs. 4.11: 4, 4.11: 8, 4.22: 2), shell chains (fig. 4.18: 5-6), running spiral (fig. 4.26: 19), multiple stemmed spirals (figs. 4.18: 8, 4.22: 3, 4.22: 7), lozenge (figs. 4.11: 11, 4.20: 14), alternating V's or iris pattern (fig. 4.22: 5), quirks, hatched ovals (figs. 4.22: 14, 4.26: 17), spray pattern, wavy or zigzag lines (fig. 4.31: 5), stemmed curves (figs. 4.9: 14, 4.12: 3), various arrangements of the concentric semi-circles (figs. 4.25: 8, 4.26: 18) and finally various versions of the Minoan flower (figs. 4.11: 5, 4.18: 2, 4.22: 24-5). Several motifs such as the Minoan flower and the alternating arcs continue from LM IIIA2, but now have become highly stylised, less elaborate and isolated, usually filling only the upper part of the decoration zone. 156 Amongst the LP material notable is the absence of the button-hook spiral, a common LM IIIC motif. 157 A pictorial krater depicting a bird and goat (263, plate 9 a), the body fragment of decorated krater (276, fig. 4.25: 15), a rim sherd with alternating arcs (240, fig. 4.21: 17) and another rim fragment decorated with elaborate hatched triangles (236, fig. 4.22: 22) are the only krater fragments amongst the LP material. 158 Popham 1970^, 19; MUM, 185, pl. 176.10-14.

Sometimes the shape, but mainly the decoration borrows features from the mainland repertoire. Their fabric, as well as the 'Minoan' adaptation of mainland decorative themes, supports Kanta' s argument for Cretan workshops imitating mainland prototypes. Such decorative features, which are regularly combined on a single vessel are the following: i) interior single or double rim band often incorrectly described as a reserved band (fig. 4.22: 12, 4.22: 15-16, 4.22: 20);170 ii) a very thin exterior rim band (figs. 4.1 1: 13,4.11: 15,4.22: 15-17,4.22: 19-20,4.22: 24-25, 4.25: 13); iii) whorl shells, with solid painted interiors or covered with dots (fig. 4.18: 10-12); iv) panelled decoration (figs. 4.11: 16, 4.22: 19-20, 4.22: 12-13). Since the upper body of 235 (fig. 4.22: 8) is missing, one cannot say whether the base belongs to a tankard or a mug, since in these two shapes the main difference lies in the spout of the tankard.171 The concave sides of the vase points to a LM IIIB date, as does the decoration of wavy lines. In this example the handle was placed quite low, near the base, but probably continued up to the rim. Popham has already pointed out that amongst the decorated sherds very few belong to closed shapes and concluded that most LP examples must have been plain and thrown away.172 The rim fragment of a Chaniot jar with double handles has a rather unusual handle arrangement; one starting at the rim is set vertically whereas a second is set horizontally below the first (278, fig. 4.25: 7). Kanta makes reference to a west Cretan deep bowl type with a third vertical handle which is influenced by the hydria.173 This peculiar handle arrangement resembles the LP example. LM III TYPE CONICAL CUPS Last, the subject of assigning various LM III type conical cups to LM IIIA or LM IIIB has to be considered. The LM III versions are easy to distinguish from LM I types since the vessel is made out of finer clay and becomes bigger in shape, having a wider rim, a narrower base and a thinner walled body (fig. 4.5: 6-8). 174 The sides of the vase can be either straight or curving. Even so there is not sufficient difference for conical cups to be assigned to LM IIIA 1/2 or LM IIIB on stylistic criteria. Warren notes a decline in popularity amongst the LM IIIA2 SEX deposits. Nonetheless, it has been pointed out that conical cups fall out of fashion after LM IIIA2, when the champagne cup replaces it in popularity.175 For example, in LM IIIAi Kommos, conical cups outnumber all other fine wares.176 But by the end of LM IIIA2 there the champagne cup has become the all-purpose small container and by LM IIIB the conical cup is represented only in small numbers. Such change might of course be of a regional character.177 Popham had suggested a similar pattern at Knossos, which the MUM LM IIIAi and LM IIIB deposits seem to follow. For the LP conical cups, when these are associated with other better-dated groups of pottery, the date of the latter has been followed. THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY: TOWARDS A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING'S STRATIGRAPHY AND HISTORY Pottery is the means for dating events, such as the construction, destruction or abandonment of a building. In our case, however, the preserved pottery assemblages must help define the sequence of events in the LP history, as the excavation notebooks fail to fulfil such a task in detail. The most instructive context from a settlement assemblage is a floor deposit, left behind either as the result of a destruction or abandonment of the building in question. In both cases, the pottery can be part of a ground floor deposit in situ or may have been housed in an upper floor, which in its collapse scattered its contents into the ground floor rooms. Pottery can also derive from secondary contexts such as under-floor fills, building material or occupation refuse. In the first two instances the pottery should be related to the building's construction, whereas the latter should be associated with subsequent 1(W Popham 19700, pl. 47 f bottom left. 170 Kanta has suggested that, for Kastelli, the reserved interior rim band could be a local development, possibly imitating mainland prototypes, cf. Kanta 1080, 2f&gt;q. 171 Popham 1964, pl. 7e for the LM IIIB example from Knossos; Popham 19700, pls. 29 d, 15 d and 45 e for LM IIIA; Kanta 1980, 284-5.

Likewise, the absence of pottery from one or more ceramic periods might imply either that ground and upper floors were cleared out in the course of continuous use, or simply the non-occupation of the site: very different events. In the following account the evidence provided from the LP boxes will be combined with the results of the 1995 LP 23rd Ephorate restoration programme (Chapter 3: Appendix). MM IIIB/LM IA, LM IA and LM IB A terminus post quern non for the construction of the LP is MM IIIB/LM IA, which accords with the date suggested by Evans on the basis of the fill under Staircase 32 and also with the results of the 1995 23rd Ephoreia restoration programme. The contents of P. I. 1 #1425, dated to MM IIIB/LM IA, indicates when the space between Staircase 34 and Room 36 was filled in with debris, amongst which were the fragments of a steatite bull's head rhyton. Naturally, this event took place after this part of the building had been constructed. The conical cup deposit in Room 22, together with the presumed deposits in P. I. 7 and P. I. 12 indicate that some event took place which left its mark within LM IA. The results of 1995 23rd Ephorate restoration can add two further building activities, namely the re-building of the w half of Room 29 N wall and the repairs to the w wall of Corridor 13. These pottery groups are contemporary with various deposits from Knossos, associated with the earthquake which preceded the eruption of Thera. The LM IA contents of P. I. 4 suggest that Room 22 became at least partially if not entirely filled in with LM IA material, and that it may have been blocked off and so remained. In conclusion, these small LM IA pottery assemblages indicate that the LP, like other buildings at Knossos, suffered some disturbance at the time of the Thera eruption. LM IA pottery groups were left behind in Room 22, somewhere along the SW Sector and in the region of the N Sector (figs. 4.2, 4.3: 1-10, 4.8: 1-4). The presence of very little LM IB material suggests that the building was continuously used at the time or was simply abandoned. Like the nearby MUM, which remained incomplete and uninhabited during this period, the LP seems to have escaped the widespread LM IB fire destructions which also affected this neighbourhood, namely the North House at the SEX site. LM II Unlike the MUM, which produced masses of LM II pottery, the LP provides only a few isolated specimens (plate 18 a). The concentration of LM II pottery in the S Court (P. I. 14) is more likely to be associated with the MUM fire destruction rather than to indicate a similar event within the LP. These sherds could have been part of the MUM destruction debris fallen within the Court or material collected by Evans when he partly explored the E half of Room Q and a small part of Corridor L in the MUM.178 The LM II pottery from within the LP is too little to suggest the existence of true deposits from this period. This lack of evidence indicates that the building escaped from, or suffered only minor damage from the LM II fire destructions observed in other neighbouring areas.179 LM IIIA All fairly complete vases described by Mackenzie in some detail date to LM IIIA 1/2: they were found in the area of Staircase 34 and Rooms 28-30 (fig. 4.32).180 The incident to which they owed their preservation was, however, not an isolated one since the large quantities of contemporary pottery scattered throughout the building prove the existence of extensive LM IIIA 1/2 levels on all parts of the site. Significant are the amounts of LM IIIA 1/2 pottery found in Corridor 18 (P. I. 5), from the area s of Room 17 (P. I. 7), near Staircase 32 (P. I. 8 and P. I. 16) and along the SW Sector (P. I. 12). The quantity and spread of the preserved material suggests that the entire building was in use, when some event took place as a result of which the pottery in question was left behind. A large number of cross-joins between different boxes suggests that LM IIIA 1/2 pottery was also stored along the upper 178 MUM, 1 n. 2. 179 Apart from the MUM, the SEX site also shows that the Gypsum House and the South House were both destroyed by fire in LM II: Warren 1982, 63-6, figs. 5-12. Closer to the Palace the House W. of the SW House (S.VII) was destroyed by fire in the same period: Macdonald 1992-3, 20. 180 The 'ewer' (fig. 4.32: 2) and the piriform jar were found scattered within Rooms 28 and 29; the clay bull's head rhyton, the squat and tall alabasters were found somewhere along the east end of Staircase 34's upper flight compartment (plan 12, fig. 4-32).</page><page sequence="130">1 2O THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY floor (figs. 4.29-4.31: 1-3). 181 Some LM IIIA1/2 pottery bears fire marks on the surface, so fire destruction is the obvious candidate.182 Important evidence was produced by the 1995 LP restoration: the N Sector was repaired in LM IIIAi. Extensive re-building operations could have followed some destruction in LM II or in LM IIIAi, the debris of which was carefully cleaned during the subsequent LM IIIAi restoration. The MUM too had suffered a minor destruction in LM II prior to the wholesale destruction along its South and Central Sectors. Alternatively, the LP might have been in a bad state of repair and required much re-building and consolidation during LM IIIAi. The presence of LM IIIAi pottery from the make-up of several walls along the LP N Sector, including the blocking wall along the E balustrade of Room 17, has serious consequences: all restorations and re-modellings took place before the deposition of large quantities of LM IIIA1/2 pottery but also before the fire destruction which preserved the sealings and Linear B tablets. A LM IIIA1/2 event in the LP was however not an isolated incident, since a great deal of contemporary material has been found throughout Knossos. In terms of pottery classification, these LM IIIA1/2 pottery groups are contemporary with the Palace destruction horizon, as defined by Popham.183 The LP vases and contemporary sherds bear strong stylistic similarities to the LM IIIAi/ 2 deposits from the Royal Villa, the S. E. House and the House of the High Priest.184 Outside Knossos, the Kommos Deposits 29-46, dated to LM III A 1/2 and considered by Watrous as contemporary to the Knossos destructions, fit within the same chronological framework.185 The presence of LM IIIA1/2 pottery from the wall make-up in Rooms 29 and 30, including a sherd joining the LM IIIA1/2 decorated pyxis is significant for reconstructing the sequence of events along this part of the LP (figs. 3.7: 5, 4.31: 1). Rooms 29 and 30 were repaired and re-occupied soon after the LM IIIA1/2 event, which left a deposit of contemporary vases along the Magazine area and Staircase 34. Only a handful of decorated sherds date to a more advanced stage of LM IIIA2, unlike early LM IIIA2, which is amply represented. There are, however, two occasions where groups of LM IIIA2 pottery were kept separately: the plain and coarse wares from Room 22 (P. I. 4, figs. 4.3-4.4) and Room 20 (P. I. 16, fig. 4.24) but also the small collection of vases from within the SW Facade in the region of the Staircase 34 (P. I. 1 1, fig. 4.13). The most important group of all is P. I. 15, deriving from the space below the upper flight of Staircase 32: this box has equal amounts of LM IIIAi 1 2, and LM IIIA2 pottery most of which is heavily discoloured by fire (fig. 4.23). P. I. 15 is significant in that it connects stratigraphically and chronologically the LM IIIA2 ceramic assemblages to the event which left great quantities of decorated LM IIIA1/2 pottery within the LP rooms (fig. 4.23). 186 The prominent traces of fire on sherds belonging to these LM IIIA2 pottery groups explicitly relate this event to fire destruction. Sealings were found in both the lower and upper flight of Staircase 32 and there is no evidence to support a view that the space below the upper flight of Staircase 32 was filled in prior to the fire destruction, which destroyed the LP. Stylistically, most of the decorated sherds compare to the material from the MUM: from Pits 8 in Room C and Pits 10 and 1 1 in the Pillar Hall (H) and part of Corridor L. P. I. 4 and P. I. 6 are comparable to groups of LM IIIA2 pottery from the SEX site.187 LM IIIB In three cases, groups of fairly complete LM IIIB vases were kept separately, namely from the area of the Staircase 32 (P. I. 9, fig. 4.12), along the SW Sector (P. I. 12, fig. 4.9: 2) and from a part of the site excavated during 1908 (P. I. GEN. #1458, fig. 4.28). It is important to emphasise that none of these assemblages can be clearly associated with the findspots of sealings and tablets. These small groups of complete pottery suggest that certain parts of the LP site were inhabited during LM IIIB early. Some event took place, after which the site was deserted. 181 Breakdown of cross-joins in number of individual vases: LM II: 1 vase (fig. 4.29: 1); LM IIIA: 20 vases; LM IIIB: 3 vases. 182 P.

Warren 1982, 77 fig. 37.</page><page sequence="131">THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY ! 2 1 The quantities of LM IIIB late sherds also suggest some form of activity along different parts of the site. Two points have to be considered here: the LM IIIB late material in several instances occurs in boxes which also contain large amounts of LM III A 1/2: this must imply the existence of separate levels within the same rooms or areas of the building. Such boxes come from Corridor 18 (P. I. 5, figs. 4.5: 13), the region of Staircase 32 (P. I. 8, fig. 4.10-4.1 1) and from the sw part of the building (P. I. 12, fig. 4.18). Furthermore, there is no proof for a stratigraphical link between the groups of fairly complete LM IIIB pottery and the large amounts of stray decorated LM IIIB late sherds. Indeed, the latter belong stylistically to an advanced stage of LM IIIB, whereas the groups of fairly complete vessels are not necessarily of the same ceramic phase, but an earlier one. The LP decorated LM IIIB late pottery is stylistically later than the abandonment pottery from the MUM North Sector but similar to the material from the MUM N Platform Pits and Pit U for the 1960's Stratigraphical Museum extension.188 The Kommos LM III deposits are also stylistically affiliated to the pottery from the N Platform Pits of the MUM. Watrous assigns the abandonment of Kommos to early LM IIIB 2. 189 Both Popham and Warren have stressed the uniform character of the LP pottery in stylistic terms and suggested a date quite advanced in LM IIIB.190 Several LP decorative motifs continue in LM IIIC, suggesting that the LM IIIB late material is chronologically close to the subsequent ceramic phase.191 By assigning the decorated sherd material to an advanced stage of the period, most of the LP LM IIIB pottery no longer qualifies as a candidate for being caught in the fire responsible for the destruction of the LP and the preservation of the sealings and Linear B tablets. The reasons why have to be traced to the Knossos Palace: the latest pottery groups from the Palace, regardless of whether they belong to the 'Last Palace' or to a 'Re-occupation' phase, date to LM IIIB. Popham hesitated to associate the LP decorated sherds and the N Platform Pits material to the Palace LM IIIB pottery groups. Indeed the latter consist of mainly complete plain wares, decorated stirrup jars and only a few decorated vases. Notable is the absence of decorated cups and deep bowls. The difference may be chronological: the Palace LM IIIB pottery could be earlier than the LP-MUM LM IIIB late groups. In conclusion: the LP pottery strongly suggests that the site was inhabited in LM IIIA1/2, LM IIIA2, LM IIIB early and LM IIIB late. In each ceramic period some event took place which left behind stratified deposits. When and what type of events occurred, and which one might best relate to the fire destruction with the sealings and Linear B tablets will be answered after the the remaining evidence is presented.192 CATALOGUE OF SELECTED POTTERY P.

The amount of pottery bearing traces of fire, from either period, is extremely small. Additionally, although a large number of cross-joins have been made for the LM IIIA1/2 material, practically none was found amongst the LM IIIB, despite the presence of a large number of sherds.</page><page sequence="132">1 2 2 THE EVANS LITTLE PALACE POTTERY later material dates to LM IIIA amongst which are the fragments of one plain LM IIIAi cup or kylix in fine clay (fig. 4.1: 2).

Most diagnostic sherds appear to be MM IIIB/LM IA apart from a few LM IIIA ones, namely an LM IIIAi kylix foot, a cup (or kylix) ledge-rim fragment, together with the stem of a large LM IIÍA2 kylix, the latter with traces of burning (fig. 4.1 : 17-20). As a whole the pottery, which had not even been washed, lacks complete profiles and consists of mostly stray pieces of plain wares ranging from semi-coarse to fine fabrics. Fig. 4.1: 12-16 illustrates the few decorated sherds, all with ripple decoration; the absence of ledge-rim conical cups amongst the fragmentary conical cups is noteworthy. The general character of the pottery looks MM IIIB/LM IA. The contents of this box do not join with any other P. I. box. Apart from the LM IIIA2 kylix no other burned sherds were noticed (fig. 4.1: 20). There is nothing in this deposit which could be associated with the specialised uses of a stone rhyton. On the contrary the pottery could be interpreted as nothing more than filling material blocking Space 35. In light of the above the LM IIIA material could be considered as intrusive. P.

Both boxes contain a mixture of very scrappy sherds from different periods including some post-Minoan material, apart from MM IIIB/LM IA, LM II, LM IIIA and LM IIIB pottery. The decorated LM IIIAi cup (2, fig. 4.1: 21), a LM IIIB type champagne cup (4, fig. 4.1: 22) and a MM IIIB/LM IA monochrome bowl (fig. 4.1: 26) are the only shapes represented amongst the more 'complete' pots together with four LM I (fig. 4.1: 25, 4.1: 27-28) and one LM III type conical cups (fig. 4.1: 23). The boxes do not contain any burned sherds; no joins were made with other P. I. boxes. Apart from the pottery, these boxes contain a number of miscellaneous small finds such as fragmentary stone vases, a clay bead necklace, two stones worked for seals, a few Minoan stone beads, a post-Minoan ivory pin and one pyramidal loomweight. Amongst these noteworthy is a rounded loomweight with a Linear A sign. All these miscellaneous small finds are probably the remains of a careful search for more fragments of the steatite bull's head rhyton. They could have come from mixed levels, makeup of walls or floor deposits of various periods. FINE PAINTED WARE 2 Cup, body frags, fig. 4.1: 21. MPH 4.5; D base 5.4. LM IIIAi.

The rim fragment of a LM I A cup with running spirals is the only sherd worth illustrating together with two LM I type conical cups (fig. 4.1 : 30-32). The remaining material, mostly LM IA, is very worn; it includes one or two sherds in LM III fabrics. The box also contains one spherical loomweight, a few small fragments of disintegrated Egyptian blue and a serpentine polisher/grinder-pounder. No cross-joins with other P. I. boxes were noted. The box lacks burned sherds. The material was collected in 1910. It should be associated with the repairs and construction of the roof above Room 17, rather than the excavation of the room, which according to the excavation notebooks seems to have been completed in 1905.

Room of cups. The provenance of the material assigned to P. I. 4 has been reviewed and Room 22 has been suggested as the origin of this box. The wooden labels suggest that some stratigraphy was maintained during excavation, however, the contents of the two boxes have been mixed up. Both include a mixture of pottery from different periods including post-Minoan sherds and small finds. The small number of LM I A sherds could be associated with a group of 29 LM I type conical cups and two 'milk' jugs, after which Room 22 was named (figs. 4.2-4.3: 1-10). LM II is represented by a few fragments of kylikes (not illustrated). LM IIIA1/2 is present, but considerably less in quantity than the LM IA material (fig. 4.3: 11-13). The bulk of the fairly 'complete' pottery can be dated to LM IIIA2 such as the fragmentary ladle (28, fig. 4.3: 19) the shallow bowl (21, fig. 4.3: 20) and several fragmentary stirrup jars (22-24, fig. 4.4: 1-3, 5). There are only one or two LM IIIB decorated sherds (18-19, fig. 4.3: 18, 22). The box contains a considerable number of burned sherds, two with ripple decoration, two with LM IA type spirals; some LM IIIAi but mainly LM IIIA2 including two of the octopus stirrup jar fragments (24-25, fig. 4.4: 3, 5) and the LM III juglet (20, fig. 4.4: 4).

Room South of Corridor and East of Shrine [illegible word in large red letters] Pendlebury's identification of this room with Room 19 has been maintained. These two boxes contain a good mixture of sherds from decorated open and closed shapes belonging to different Minoan and post-Minoan periods. A fair amount of LM IA pottery is present (fig. 4.8: 1-4). To this 1 1 LM I type conical cups (not illustrated) can be added. The largest amount of pottery, however, dates to LM IIIA1/2 including 'fairly complete' vessels and numerous decorated rim and closed vessel sherds.

According to the label they could be associated either with Room 28 or Room 29. However, P. I. 8 is the box, which contained the LM IIIAi piriform jar with a network pattern (84, fig. 4.32: 4), discovered in the area of Room 30 and the space for the upper flight of Staircase 34. Consequently, it is most probable that P. I. 8 contains also pottery from the area of the Magazines. The boxes contain a good mixture of LM IIIA and LM IIIB late pottery, both of which are represented in equal amounts, plus minor quantities of MM IIIB/LM IA, one or two LM IB and LM II sherds plus a few post-Minoan. A variety of shapes are represented, such as the usual decorated cups (81-82, fig. 4.10: 1-2), a strainer (83, fig. 4.3), a piriform jar (84, fig. 4.32: 4) - amongst the LM IIIA material; kylikes, cups, bowls - amongst the LM IIIB late (fig. 4.1 1). To these the fragments of four plain pyxides (109-112, fig. 4.10: 13-16) can be added. Of the five burned sherds, three date to LM IIIA, one to LM III generally. Cross-joins have been made with P. I. 12 and P. I. 15. The Hellenistic terracotta mask referred to in Pendlebury 1933-5 was n°t amongst the contents of this box. FINE PAINTED WARES 80 Closed vessel, body frags, fig. 4.10: 5.

Mixed lot, post Minoan. *M39 Box: K ...ttle Palace ....oom North East of N landing of Stairway P I 10 05 The provenance of this box can be associated with Room 25. Only a few stray sherds are kept, including only three LM III, the remaining ranging from Geometric to Hellenistic. In the area N of the lower landing of Staircase 32, Mackenzie marked the discovery of a curving wall (plan 10). In light of the post-Minoan sherds kept in P. I. 10, this feature can be interpreted as part of a Hellenistic well sunk deep into the Minoan levels. P. I. 11 (fig. 4.13) Guide: Within W. façade S. W. of W. Stairs. 1 box '08. L.M. I.-L.M.

Unfortunately the exact find spot for the contents of this box cannot be securely located, although the area s of Staircase 34 seems the most probable candidate. The box contains two fairly complete closed vessels, a LM IIIA2 stirrup jar (130, fig. 4.13: 4) and a LM IIIA2 or LM IIIB amphora with octopus decoration (131, fig. 4.13: 5), which probably represent the contents of a floor deposit. The remaining material is very fragmentary, consisting mainly of LM IIIA decorated sherds. There is only one cross-join with P. I. 12, namely a large LM IIIB kylix (325, fig. 4.31: 5).

According to the label, box #1442 could have contained material from Room 31, but since the contents of these boxes have been thoroughly mixed up, it is unsafe to associate any pottery exclusively with this room. The few decorated LM IA sherds together with one 'milk jug' and 33 LM I type conical cups probably represent some floor deposit (fig. 4.14). Apart from a heavily burned LM IIIA2 (or LM IIIB) stirrup jar (180, fig. 4.19: 1) and the LM IIIB Chaniot spouted bowl (175, fig. 4.19: 2), there is little pottery later than LM IIIA. Predominant amongst the LM IIIA material is the decorated cup (fig. 4.15: 1-12 and fig. 4.16: 1-5). There are several post-Minoan conical and round loomweights and several fragmentary Minoan stone vases. Sherds from these boxes join up with P. I. 8, P. I. 7 and P. I. 14. All boxes, apart from #1443, contain burned sherds the dates of which range from LM IIIA 1-2. FINE PAINTED WARES 132 Cup, 50% complete, fig. 4.14: 1; D rim 9, base 4.3. FB; slipped and polished.

However, the quantities of MM IIIB/LM IA and mature LM IA suggest that at least the earlier material came from Evans's tests along the E end of the S Corridor and the S Platform of the MUM. Two LM I type conical cups are not illustrated. Amongst the later material, which is very scrappy, there is some LM II, a few LM IIIA1/2 and more LM IIIB sherds (fig. 4.19: 3-6). Noteworthy is a LM IIIA2 large decorated kylix and a contemporary cup decorated with alternating arcs (193, 192, fig. 4.19: 3 and 6).

At first, the excavators could not distinguish whether it came out of the wall or was part of an upper floor collapse.2 As excavation progressed in the same area more tablet fragments were found, this time together with sealings.3 The deposit of Linear B tablets extended over a still larger area, since Evans reported some within the earth fill of Rooms 8 and g.4 As seen in plan 15 tablets were found in several locations: to the se of column base 2, which was marked with 'x iscript.'; in the region of the nw corner of Room 7 and near the blocked doorways; together with sealings, indicated by 'xxx seals 4- inscrpt'; and finally in the region of the blocked up doorjambs, between Rooms 8 and 9, marked by 'insc' (plan 53). Individual Linear B tablets can be assigned to the LP according to four different sources. These consist of Evans's notes, and papers in the Myers Archive relating to the publication of SM II: 1. Two fragmentary tablets together with several sealings were sketched by Evans in the 1908 AE/NB? The tablets, subsequently numbered &lt;igoi&gt; and &lt;igo2&gt;, were missed by Myers and first reported by Palmer. 2. Amongst the Myers papers in the Ashmolean Museum is a folder in which the 04 tablet series was kept. This document, referred to by Palmer as part of the Handlist, mainly catalogues the Arsenal tablets discovered in 1904.6 The folder contains paper cuttings in Evans's handwriting, annotated by Myers with numbers added in red pencil. Two pages in the usual 1905 AE/NB size paper accompanied them. These listed six fragmentary tablets numbered 04.94, 04.95, °4-96&gt; °4-97 and 04.98 under the heading 'W. Building: House of the Fetish Shrine'.7 Reproductions of these drawings, which were made by Evans, were published in SM II. 3. In 1946, during the re-organisation of the Villa Ariadne and the Stratigraphical Museum, Hutchinson discovered several tablets. Inked drawings were sent to Myers.8 The letter was headed 'Fragmentary tablets from outside S. E. angle of Little Palace excavated in 1931 (P I. 17 in Pendlebury's A Guide to the Stratigraphical Museum'). It listed three tablets, which were numbered i64i=(o4.96), 04.94 and 1643.9 4. A final set of fragmentary tablets were assigned to the LP according to a page entitled 'Little Palace area in general Pendlebury's Catalogue P I 17'.10 This document can be identified with the list and drawings of tablets made in 1 947 by Hilda Pendlebury. Four of these sketches were published in SM II under the M series: M 127, 128, 129 and 130.11 1 The CoMIK numbers have been retained for the LP tablets. The seals and extant sealings are identified by their CMS catalogue numbers and HM inventory numbers; Gill's 'U' numbers are also used for sealings (including those which are now missing). For the remaining small finds the prefix SF has been added to differentiate them from the pottery catalogue numbers. 2 DM/DB 22.iv.05, 48. 3 DM/DB 2rs.iv.0f;, rl2. 4 These were sketched by Evans in AE/NB iqo.%, rs. 5 AE/NB 1C108, qa; Palmer, OKT, 168-q.

I. 17 and the General boxes, presumably from an incorrect reading of Pendlebury and Money- Coutts 1933-5, 24- 11 These fragments became known as Ak 2126 = M 126; L 2127 = M 127; X 2128 = M 128; Dk 2129 = M 129 and Da 2 130 = M 130. 177</page><page sequence="187">!78 THE SMALL FINDS There is no reason to doubt the provenance of the tablets listed by Evans in the first two documents. The remaining tablet fragments were kept in P. I. 17, a box containing LM I material collected in 1931. These tablets form a diverse group of stray fragments listing a variety of commodities. Olivier has attributed individual fragments to scribes 120, 1 18 and 108, who were also active in the Palace.12 Some pieces are quite worn, of different clays and colours. The early date of the pottery in addition to the nature of the material excludes a LP provenance for these fragments. They are probably misplaced fragments, which belong to the main Palace archive.13 Consequently only those tablets sketched by Evans will be associated with the LP deposits (table 5.1). The remaining fragments (table 5.2) should not be linked to the LP and therefore the proposed list of LP tablets compiled recently by Firth and Melena remains problematic.14 Scribal Hands and Bureaucratic Organisation13 Very little can be said about the scribes who produced the eight different tablet fragments which Evans assigned to the LP, since all but three are missing (table 5.1).16 None of these three has been associated with scribes also active in the Palace and Olivier has identified three different scribal hands.17 In addition, most LP tablets are too fragmentary to offer any information as to the type of transactions with which the building could have been associated. C &lt;i9O2&gt; is a CATTLE tablet. X 1(541 records the name a-mi-ni-si-jo.]H Chadwick notes that X 8101 could be a list of names, including ku-ri-sa-to, although the tablet is too fragmentary to permit safe restoration of the damaged words.19 The most complete tablet is As &lt;4493&gt;.20 The first line preserves the heading, lines 2 and 3 include a list of personnel. According to Melena it lists men of different occupations. The heading of As &lt;4493&gt; has been interpreted 'e-qe-ta inspectors in the charge of the kopwoi: So-and So'.21 Amongst the men listed one is e-ro-pa-ke-u, a masculine name for a craftsman belonging to the textile industry; zß- ro[ might be a shepherd; whereas the occupation of ra-wo-po-qo and ko-h' remains unknown. It should be noted that ra-wo-po-qo is a Greek name.22 Melena suggests that if ko-ki[ conceals the male name ko- ki-da, he could be the master carpenter registered on As &lt;4493&gt;.23 The small number of tablets found raises the question whether an archive was kept within the LP, or whether these fragments should be considered as stray pieces.24 Regarding the findspots of these tablets, in several instances they were accompanied by sealings, which could be used as an argument in favour of their contemporaneity. The coexistence of sealings and tablets implies that something more extensive in the line of administration was undertaken in the LP. Even so, the small number of Linear B tablets implies that at the time when the N and E Sectors were burned down no substantial archive happened to be kept in the LP. SEALINGS Provenance and Sources The deposit of sealings was far more widely distributed within the ground floor rooms of the N and E Sectors than that of the Linear B tablets. Sealings where found scattered within at least eight different rooms (plan 53 and table 5.4). Mackenzie described in detail the earth fill within Room 19, which he considered characteristic of the deposits in the region: the soil was loose and tawny in colour. The sealings were discovered at a considerable height above the floor, which indicated that they had 12 Dk 2129, written by scribe 120, has been joined to tablet 8720: CoMIKW, 201.

X 8101 was published by Chadwick »957» 15°- 2(1 Palmer, OKT, 168; Melena 1975, 37-40, 46; Deger-Jalkotzy 1978, 92-4. 21 Kopwoi could be 'young apprentices?': Melena 1975, 41-2. 22 Baumbach 1983, 8; Lawophorguos according to Heubeck 1969, 535-44, esp. 537. Lawopokwos according to Landau 1958, 1 20. 2 Melena 1975, 40. 21 Driessen ( 1 994) has argued that small groups of fragmentary tablets dealing with a variety of commodities and written by different scribes could have limited archaeological and epigraphical use.</page><page sequence="188">THE SMALL FINDS 179 Table 5.1.

The discovery of sealings within adjacent rooms in similar conditions, led Mackenzie to assume that all originally belonged to rooms situated above the lower storey. Evans compiled a hand list of the LP sealings according to the room in which they were discovered. Each impression was briefly described or given a rough sketch; for some he included both. In her 1965 study on the provenance and identification of the Knossos sealings, Margaret Gill published Evans's sketches and assigned numbers to each individual entry: the LP sealings became known as the U list.25 Subsequently, the latest sealings from the Palace and houses at Knossos and their related documents from the Evans Archive were illustrated in Popham and Gill 1995. The definitive publication of the extant LP sealings now appears in CMS U.S.21' 25 Gill 1965, 85-91, pls. 1 7-19. Evans's LP sealings lists are fully illustrated in Popham and Gill 1995, 23-8 and pl. 45 b, 4O-7. -)(i Gill, Müller and Pini 2002. See esp. 107 and 1 23-7 for Gill's account of the findspots.</page><page sequence="189">!8o THE SMALL FINDS Evans's LP sealings list embodies three different documents: a loose page of the normal AE/NB size in which sealings U1-U24, together with tablets X &lt;igoi&gt; and C &lt;igo2&gt;, were recorded; two pages attached to the 1 905 notebook, listing U25-U1 12; and a loose but larger in size page, mainly repeating previously recorded information.27 In the 1905 AE/NB U25 to U116 were catalogued under the headings 'Sealings W. Building House of Fetishes' and 'H. of Fetishes. (Sealings)'. These are the usual terms by which the building was named during 1905. The sealings are listed in a compact manner, which makes it sometimes difficult to assign individual pieces to specific rooms.28 The provenance for each group was written on the left side or centre; sometimes a group of sealings was assembled together by brackets. The U list matches the distribution of sealings as recorded by Mackenzie, though in two instances the former complements the latter: Room 12 and the E end of Room 22. The unbound page listing sealings U1-U24 and the two fragmentary tablets, originally belonged to the 1908 AE/NBP It is however highly improbable that a deposit of 23 sealings and apparently two tablets, if discovered in 1908, would have been missed by Mackenzie in DM/DB. Can sealings U1-U24 and tablets X &lt;i9oi&gt; and C &lt;igo2&gt; be assigned to a specific room? CMS1 1 1. 8 no. 240 (HMs 421/U2) was attributed to 'under door W. of Shrine N. S. Room', which almost certainly refers to Corridor 13, which was partly uncovered in 1905 and fully excavated in 1908.™ For the remaining sealings Room 7 or Room 1 7 are the best candidates, especially since no other sealings have been assigned by Evans to these rooms in the U list. In addition, the nw area of Room 7 fits the description since Mackenzie recorded the discovery of one or two fragmentary tablets together with a considerable deposit of broken sealings. The revised distribution of sealings incorporating the U list is given in table 5.4. Number of Sealings The total number of clay impressions discovered may have been larger than the 1 1 6 identified by Gill in the U list, since in various instances Evans refers to several fragments under a specific entry.31 Of the 1 1 6 sealings in Gill's catalogue, only 5 1 were accompanied by rough pencil drawings. Evans eventually published in PM an abbreviated catalogue of 46 sealings, known as the E list.32 This presents a selection of the most intriguing and fairly complete sealings, including some sketched in AE/NB and already published in PMP It should be stressed that Evans did not re-examine the sealings before compiling the E list, but merely drew on his earlier notes and sketches (i.e. the U list). Unfortunately the U and E lists still remain our main sources on the LP sealings, since more than a hundred have been lost. Sealings in the Herakleion Museum The three sealings published in Evans 1904-5 were handed over to Herakleion Museum in 1908 and were correctly catalogued in the Museum inventories as from 'MéyctQOV naqá too jueTÓ%ico flouyaoa. Avaoxacpr) A. Eßavc'.34 However, four more LP sealings, all of which had been drawn for publication, were taken to the Museum in the same year. These were recorded in the 1908 AE/NB, but were incorrectly assigned in the Museum documents to the 'Oixía ttqoç vóxov avaxrÓQOU Kvcooooó. 1 908 avaoxacpri Eßavc.33 Finally in 1940 a batch of sealings, including 10 from the LP, was rediscovered in the Herakleion Museum.36 Most had been recorded in the 1905 AE/NB and several had already been drawn for publication. ~~ Ui 14 was the only new addition. -'* Gill 1065, 86.

Of the 116 sealings listed in AE/NB, 1 2 were drawn for publication37 and 4 1 were included in the PM E list. A few other sealings were assigned to the LP in PM, though they were not included in the U list.38 In some cases the attribution is demonstrably wrong. In conclusion, only a fraction of the sealings found are available for study (c. 18-20 out of at least + 120) (table 5.4). To the Popham and Gill 1995 list of 18 sealings two more have been added: CMS II. 8 no. 459 (HMs 1245) perhaps from Staircase 32 and CMSll.8 no. 311 (KSM no number) assigned by its label to the P. I. Stratigraphical Museum boxes, which contain pottery and other finds from the LP. If not destroyed, the missing LP sealings are not to be found in either the Herakleion Museum or the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos. A large number of LP sealings seem to have been fragmentary when discovered: a situation similar to those found in other deposits from LM III Knossos.39 Among the 20 sealings published in CMS II. 8, impressions of LM lentoids predominate; no. 273 is the partial impression of a metal signet ring.40 Although it is risky to work from Evans's rough sketches, most of these also seem to show impressions of lentoids, apart from U62, which could have been impressed by an amygdaloid. CMS II. 8 no. 84 (HMs 657/U105) is the impression of an MM II- III hard stone seal (perhaps a Petschafi) engraved with a Hieroglyphic inscription.41 Otherwise all of the original seals used were apparently LM in date.42 Apart from the metal ring (CMSll.8 no. 273/HMs 418/U56/E1) most of the seals were made of hard stone.43 CMS* II. 8 no. 133 (HMs 417/U12) has attracted considerable comment because the horse was considered a later 'Mycenaean' feature added to an earlier 'Minoan' seal depicting a masted ship; however, the seal is now dated by Pini to LM I.44 Most of the extant sealings were impressed by seals datable to LM II-IIIAi or LM IIIAi. CMSll.8 no. 238 (HM 650) is a unique motif depicting a hunter carrying two animals suspended from a pole across his shoulders.45 Also noteworthy are two examples depicting a 'Master of Animals', a theme popular in LM II- IIIAi glyptic:46 CMS II. 8 no. 252 (HMS 651/U31) and no. 253 (HMs 652/U104). CMSll.8 no. 214 (HMs 656/U115) and U93 have been assigned by Younger to his 'Spectacle-Eye Group', a workshop active in LM IIIA.47 CMS II.8 no. 252 (HMs 651/U31) and U67 could be also assigned to the same group.48 It should be stressed that although the preserved sealings are only a fraction of the original numbers none can be attributed to Cretan workshops of the later 14th century, which would post-date the early LM IIIA2 destruction in the Knossos Palace.49 Nodules for Securing Objects Any discussion of the LP sealings is impeded by the fact that at least 100 nodules are missing. Consequently, the preserved sample is too small to offer answers regarding the entire deposit, either on matters of dating or in understanding the original function of the sealings. All extant LP sealings 38 CMS II. 8 nos. 218 (HMs 653) and 238 (HMs 650) attribution to LP confirmed by Gill, Müller and Pini 2005, 126. For Eb, Ec and Ed see above n. 33. E19 cannot be identified among the extant sealings. 39 Evans noted the poor condition of the Palace sealing deposits, commenting that some were imperfectly baked, others might have been damaged during their collapse from upper floors or the sealings had been broken off prior to the destruction: PM IV, 592-3. Weingarten (1988, 5) observed that their poor quality often prevents classification. Detailed study by the CMS" team now reveals that over 90% of the late sealings were deliberately broken, see Krzyszkowska 2005, 2 2(5; the extant LP sealings belong to varieties comparable to those found in the main Palace (ibid.). 40 CMSll.8 no. 273 (HMs 418/U56/E1). Note there is no apparent connection between sealings HMs 418 and U18, depicting architectural features identified by Evans as shrines and the furnishings of the so called Fetish Shrine and Room 1 7, as Evans suggested: Evans 1904-5, 12 fig. 5-6; Gesell 1985, 93; Marinatos and Hägg 1986, 65. 41 See comment by Pini, in Gill, Müller and Pini 2002, 10.

The remainder are too fragmentary or poorly preserved to date. 4:i Impressions of soft stone seals include: CMS II. 8 no. 164 (HMs 659/U1 17) dated to LM I; nos. 184 (HMs 658/U66) and 218 (HMs 653), both LM II-IIIAi; nos. 215 (HMs 423/U12) and 275 (HMs 655), both undatable. CMS II. 8 nos. 164 and 184 were assigned to the 'Cretan Popular Group' by Younger 1983, 1 18, 126; these seals are usually made of serpentine (ibid. 123). 11 Kenna in Boardman, OKT, 99-100; Betts 1973, 29-30.

In addition, the agrimi on UÖ7 has the characteristic 'Mumps and two large dots on the jaw', typical of Younger's Spectacle-Eye Group C; Younger 1986, 119. 49 For workshops of this period see Younger 1987, 44-5. The engraving of hard stone seals and metal signet rings on Crete had evidently ceased by the end of LM IIIA2; nor is there evidence that soft stone seals were made after LM IIIA2/B1. But since 'heirloom' seals remained in circulation in LM IIIB and later, the impressions on the Knossos sealings cannot be used to date the destruction(s) which baked them: Krzyszkowska 2005, 199, 2 14-5, 228-9.</page><page sequence="191">!82 THE SMALL FINDS Table 5.3.

With two exceptions all belong to Müller's Schnurplomben (literally string- sealings).31 Ordinarily these nodules were fashioned around heavy cords made of leather, gut or fibre; sometimes two cords were involved, or two lengths of the same cord were twisted together. Thus the nodules actually sealed or secured the objects to which they were attached. This view is supported by the fact that most examples are found deliberately broken, either along the string-hole or front-to- back. Among the LP sealings 1 7 or 1 8 fit this description.32 This means that the extant fragments were probably not attached to stored commodities at the time of the destruction.33 One very fragmentary nodule has been classed as a 'combination sealing', as it shows traces of fine wicker-work on the underside, in addition to the string running through the centre.34 One complete sealing (CMS II. 8 no. 238/HM 650) is identified by Müller as a Schnurplombe mit giebelförmiger Rückseite.55 Gable-shaped hanging nodules differ significantly from the vast majority of string-sealings, in that they are formed around thin cord, carefully knotted to prevent the clay from slipping. Normally found complete, they probably served as labels, a suggestion supported by the fact that nodules of this variety sometimes carry Linear B inscriptions. Finally one of the LP sealings CMS 11.8 no. 442/HM 422 has been identified as a Tonstempel (i.e. clay stamp or matrix).30 Its poorly preserved seal impression appears in intaglio, i.e. it was made by impressing an ancient seal impression into the clay. Although several clay stamps or matrices are known among the Knossos sealings, their function is unknown.37 Both Weingarten and Palaima have noted that the Knossos sealings indicate that the Mycenaean administrative system had shifted to a non-intensive pattern of seal use.38 The majority of the surviving sealings seem to have been stamped by individual owners, since in very few instances sealings impressed by the same seal have been found. Weingarten has suggested that this non-intensive pattern reflects non-residential seal owners, who were sending sealed goods to Knossos. The LP sealings constitute one of the largest groups found at Knossos, second only to the deposits found scattered throughout the East Wing of the Palace.39 The sealing types represented in both locations - notably the preponderance of broken string-sealings - indicate that incoming shipments were opened (and possibly stored) on the upper floors. Unfortunately, the sealings themselves give no clues as to the nature of the commodities involved. 31 Gill, Müller and Pini 2002, 52-69. Cf.

It was discovered in 1931, below the 4th gypsum slab of the lower flight of the Staircase 32, when this was raised during restoration work. The associated pottery, was dated by Evans 'to the transitional MM III-LM I epoch'.61 STONE VASES AND STONE TOOLS The Steatite Bull's Head Rhyton and its Findspot Evans considered the steatite bull's head rhyton (SFi) as part of the furnishings of an upper floor room, located above Room 3o.62 Mackenzie reported its discovery in a walled pit, named Pit A (Space 35) at roughly one metre down from the preserved walls. The architectural features of Space 35 suggest that the rubble walls which created Mackenzie's Pits A and B, helped support a second upper flight for Staircase 34. The pottery from Pit A was kept in two separate boxes (P. I. 1), representing material found above but also with the stone rhyton. In general the pottery dates to MM III/LM I, apart from a few LM IIIA sherds (fig. 4.1: 12-20). Nothing in the scrappy pottery is indicative of a specialised use in relation to the rhyton's intended function. The LM IIIA sherds are probably intrusive and consequently the stone rhyton should be associated with the MM IIIB/LM IA material. Mackenzie reported on the efforts made to find all the fragments of the rhyton. The earth collected from this region was almost certainly sieved, as attested by the many stray small finds kept in the relevant P. I. boxes. It is certain that the rhyton was already broken before it was thrown in Space 35. There are two possible explanations regarding its find place and state of preservation: 1. Space 35 was filled in with rubbish, containing not only fragmentary MM IIIB/LM IA material. The fragmentary stone rhyton was thrown in as well. 2. The broken up stone rhyton was intentionally thrown into Space 36 as a foundation deposit. Paul Rehak has suggested that stone bull's head rhyta were ritualistically smashed and subsequently placed as a foundation deposit.63 The find circumstance of the LP stone rhyton does not contradict such an interpretation. 1)0 Titles in italics refer to the names Evans used in AE/NB, see plate () ¿, 46 and 48.

'* Rehak 1995.</page><page sequence="194">THE SMALL FINDS 185 The LP steatite bull's head rhyton it is not only an exquisite example of its kind, but, together with the chlorite rhyton from the palace at Zakros, one of the best preserved.64 The vessel was reconstructed by Gilliéron and published by Evans in detail.6"1 Rhyta (MSV type 34D) in the form of a bull's head are known from several fragmentary examples found both on Crete and on the mainland.66 Serpentine and chlorite are the two types of stone employed. The shape was copied in more luxurious materials, such as silver, or in cheaper clay versions.67 Warren places their manufacture in MM III-LM IA, although many have been found in later LM I and LM III contexts. The large number of fragments found at Knossos point to the existence of a local workshop responsible for most of the known pieces. Other Stone Vessels Apart from the steatite bull's head rhyton, no other stone vessel was reported by Evans or Mackenzie. Consequently, the material discussed below could be treated as random fragments, presumably originating from Minoan or even from post-Minoan levels. A selection of the most interesting and worthwhile pieces is presented. The chlorite ear (SF4) is kept in P. I. 2, said to contain material from Pit B in Space 35. It offers little evidence for the existence of a second comparable rhyton. It was attached to the head in a more upward position than SFi, like the ear from the Zakros rhyton. A similar find was made in the Tomb of the Double Axes, where two steatite ears and 'inlays for the cheek and forehead in the shape of quatrefoil plaques of a kind of hard schist' were the only rhyton parts to be discovered.68 The serpentine blossom bowl (SF6) (MSV type 5) is of the canonical form, with its vertical ribs, repeating six flower petals. Bowl (SF5), also made of serpentine, has diagonal flutings and a high shoulder profile (MSV type 9B). These shapes are predominantly MM III/LM IA and LM I.69 SF7 is a cylindrical pyxis. The drill hole in the projecting ring base would help fasten the vessel's lid to the body. Pyxides are known mainly from EM contexts, where they are almost all made out of chlorite, such as the fragmentary (SF15) with spiral decoration.70 Our example, which probably is of a later date, has no exact parallels. There are four fragmentary stone lamps (MSV type 24 IIA), two of serpentine (SF16) and one of grey- white marble (SF10). All are too incomplete for reconstruction. SF10 is worth mentioning since marble is a rather unusual material for lamps. Warren has noted the rarity of the material, which is known from a medium pedestal lamp from Knossos and the Mycenae and Thorikos low lamps.71 Stand lamps range from MM III to LM IIIA. Both lids (SF19 and SF20) have pawn-shaped handles and a barrelled underside to the rim made to fit the mouth of a small-sized vase (MSV type 27). The small fragment of a chalice foot SF12 (MSV type 15) was worked from lapis lacedaemonius. The shape dates to MM III-LM I, but of more interest is the material, which was imported from the southern Péloponnèse. Very few stone vases of lapis lacedaemonius are known from Crete, one being in the shape of a chalice.72 The fragment of a large vessel, probably a stand, is made of an Egyptian stone: diorite of the Chefren variety (SF13). Stone Objects Noteworthy is the fragmentary hammer made out of pink-grey breccia (SF9). In shape it closely resembles the hammers from the Temple Repositories, although here the edges of the object are barely damaged. Several examples are known from settlements on Crete, the most famous being the stone hammers from the Treasury room in the w wing of the palace at Zakros; with others known from Pseira, Ayia Triada, Tylissos and Sklavokampos. Others have been recovered from tombs, such as Poros and Archanes-Phourni.7"5 A few stone tools such as one or two whetstones, plaques and a stone pestle have been kept, but without any exact stratigraphical context, they are of little value.

Their distribution clearly suggest that all fell from the upper floor (plans 10, 21). Yet, Mackenzie was emphatic in suggesting that the horns of consecration (SF21) were in situ, broken by debris, which fell during the collapse of building material from the upper floor.75 The original position of the animal figurines (SF27) remains uncertain, but these were reported as found at a level slightly lower than that of the gypsum ledge. The position of the objects, corroborates that either all had fallen from upper floor or that the fetishes should be disassociated from the horns and possibly the figurines, the latter group belonging to a shrine located within Room 17. The distribution of the finds, however, is in support of an upper floor collapse for all the finds within Room 17. Four of the concretions are of sandstone, the fifth of limestone (SF22-26). These were probably collected for their vague resemblance to human figures, although some, such as SF24 and SF26, are too amorphous to suggest such a likeness.76 None of the stones bears any tool marks or signs of colour.77 The closest parallels are two stone concretions, the first found in the MM I tholos tomb at Apesokari, the second from the LM IIIB shrine at Gazi.78 Warren has reviewed the archaeological and iconographical evidence in support of the argument that certain stones were considered sacred in the Bronze Age Aegean.79 Notable are the representation of baetyls on seals, which often are associated with female or male figures clasping or leaning against them.80 The earliest baetyl comes from an EM III house at Vasiliki, the latest from the LH IIIB shrine at Phylakopl.81 Most examples of baetyls stand in the open air. The LP concretions are amongst the few instances where such objects are placed within a building and associated with other religious paraphernalia such as horns of consecration and animal figurines. The horns of consecration (SF21) were found broken. Evans incorrectly described them as of plaster, but they were made of stone, probably limestone.82 In LM I limestone is regularly used for such objects, whereas in LM III painted clay versions become popular.83 Thus the LP horns of consecration could have been an heirloom within the LM III building. The animal figurines (SF27) are missing, so little can be said regarding their date, number and nature. Figurines are regularly associated with horns of consecration in both Neo-palatial and Post-palatial shrines.84 Although the problem of the Fetish Shrine's location has been solved, its date cannot be easily clarified. Unfortunately, no pottery was associated with the Shrine furnishings. The date of the Fetish Shrine can be clarified only by the numerous sealings, which were also found in Rooms 17 and 19. Consequently, the date of the fire destruction, which preserved the LP sealings and tablets, will also provide a date for the Fetish Shrine. Other Finds from Room 17 Room 1 7 yielded a second group of finds, which were reported separately from the objects of the Fetish Shrine: a fragmentary faience vessel (SF28), some crystal discs (SF30) and bronze curls (SF29). Evans preferred to associate these finds with an earlier shrine. Their exact provenance remains 71 Evans 1004-5, 8- 1 1 . 7r&gt; The broken half of the horns of consecration were never found. 7t) Natural stones, similar in shape and material to the LP fetishes are quite common in Crete both near beaches and inland. Such stones have been noticed near Tylissos, Iouktas and Kalami, in the centre of the island as well as at the west, and Ayia Photia in the east. Within the LP in three different instances sandstone concretions are incorporated within the rubble construction of ground floor walls. Platon reviewed the evidence for the association of such stones to ritual practices; however, he incorrectly identified some with stalagmites and related them to a chthonic cult: Platon 10,30, 160-8. 77 Warren has considered the LP concretions as part of a continuum between aniconic figures and baetyls: Warren îqoo, 202. 78 A natural stone which was worked at the navel and had a human shape was reported in front of the altar within the Apesokari Tholos Tomb, which dates to MM I: Gesell 1985, (38- 9. A stone concretion was also reported in the LM IIIB shrine of at Gazi, which unlike all other objects in this shrine was not found on the floor but at a slightly higher level: Gesell 1985, 69- 71; Marinatos 1Q37, 200 fig. 3. 79 Warren ìquo, iqu-206. 80 Warren has collected the scenes with an oval stone and a kneeling figure (most of which are depicted on gold rings); for catalogue see Warren 1990, 195-200. 81 Others include the upright stone at Gournia and the rounded stone embedded in the Central Court at Mallia: Warren 1990, 202-3, figs. 18-22. 82 Although the horns of consecration are missing, several photographs of the Fetish Shrine show clearly that these are made of stone: Marinatos and Hirmer 1060, 42. 83 Painted clay versions first appear in LM IIIA2 and continue into LM IIIC: D'Agata 1992, 253-4. 84 Gesell 1985, 146-7.</page><page sequence="196">THE SMALL FINDS 187 uncertain, although Evans's account hints at the sunken area of the lustral basin as a possible findplace.85 Bronze curls found in the Palace have been interpreted as wigs for figurines.86 Crystal discs are known from the Gaming Board and the Throne Room in the Palace. Other Finds Evans dated the lead female figurine with upraised hands (SF32) to the re-occupation period, because of her crude appearance.87 Alexiou and Gesell followed Evans's dating, relying mainly on the figurine's gesture, and suggested that her discovery in the region of Room 36 implied a continuation of cult. 88 Mackenzie and subsequently Evans had reported that the figure was found 'above the lower courses' of the S Facade (plan 13).89 Evans suggested that it had fallen from the upper floor, but its position above the preserved section of the wall implies that it came from a mixed context. Apart from the upraised hands, which immediately recall LM IIIB and LM IIIC clay female figurines,90 most of her features suggest an earlier date. Beginning with the gesture, in most LM III figurines the palms are not in frontal position. Besides she is wearing the typical triangular Minoan skirt rather than the LM III cylindrical one. The rings at her wrists, neck and waist find parallels in LM I.91 Finally the rendering of her hair with the snake curled up resembles earlier figurines.92 The LP lead figurine with upraised hands could well be dated to LM I rather than to LM III. Finally, the provenance of a clay figurine (SF32) first published by Boardman remains unknown. It dates stylistically to LM IIIAi.

These modifications were considered the starting point for the Re-occupation period within this part of the LR The same area was later destroyed by fire. A fierce conflagration caused the collapse of the upper floor, which choked the rooms below with terracotta-coloured debris. This earth was strikingly distinct from the pale grey soils which overlay the burnt Minoan building. The latter earth was associated with occupation levels of post-Minoan date, which were removed rapidly due to the wager system. Discovered within the earth fill of the ground floor rooms were some one hundred lumps of clay, which had seen service as sealings, together with a small group of clay tablets in Linear B. Mackenzie regarded them as part of the upper floor collapse. A much re-modelled lustral basin was identified as a ground floor house shrine, on the basis of the objects found within. The recorded pottery was in general dated to the LM III period, including a deposit of plain cups (plan 9, figs. 4.2, 4.3: 1-10). Evans gave a colourful description of the material remains in the preliminary report for the 1 905 season and concluded that, even during this degraded period of the Re-occupation, the inhabitants of the LP had knowledge of the Linear B script and kept sealed documents and possessions within the building.2 The stratigraphy within the remaining part of the ground floor, namely the Central and SW Sectors, which were excavated in 1908, was more difficult to interpret. In various areas both within the LP and in the space between it and the MUM, Mackenzie seems to have been uncertain as to whether the deposits had been mixed by the latest inhabitants of the building, or later disturbed by stone robbing, or by Roman wells and walls, whose foundations were often sunk deep into the Minoan levels. Despite these obstacles, some deposits dated to the Last Palace Period were reported from the area of the Magazines and Staircase 34 (plan 12, fig. 4.32). Evans, in a subsequent publication, commented extensively on the architecture of the SW Region and the Basement, but made no references to the nature of the deposits. Several vessels, which were dated to the Last Palace Period, were reported and illustrated.3 No attempt was made to connect the stratigraphy of this region with the N and E Sectors. Evans only revised his views when writing PM. In the second volume, he stated that the worshippers of the Fetish Shrine (Room 17) 'were surely analphabetV , and in the fourth volume that the deposit of sealings was assigned to a destruction contemporary with the 'last Age of the Palace'.4 SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH ON THE DATE OF THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS It was only natural for Palmer, in his study of the Knossos excavations, to overemphasise the date initially given by Evans to the LP sealings and tablet deposits.3 This Re-occupation horizon was likewise highlighted by W.-D. Niemeier, who also was in favour of a LM IIIB Palace at Knossos.6 However, both scholars have failed to take into account one important factor: the excavators' reasons for assigning a later date to these deposits.7 Both studies stressed the evidence of a fierce destruction by fire, baking the sealings and tablets. This observation was related to Mackenzie's statement on the Late Minoan III character of the pottery.8 A second point, prominently highlighted, was Evans's remarks 1 Evans 1914, 59. - Lvans 1904-5, 15-ib. :i Evans 1914, 5-N. 1 PM II, 544 and IV, 599-(k)o. 1 Palmer, OKT, 162-9 and 229.

A LM IIIB date for the LP destruction - recently argued by Eric and Birgitta Hallager13 - cannot be sustained on the basis of a handful of LM IIIB Kydonian imports (figs. 4.12: 2 and 4.19: 2), which apparently did not derive from areas that produced deposits of tablets and sealings. Boardman and Popham both recognised the problematic nature of the material, especially in light of the site's complex stratigraphy, and pointed out the difficulty in reaching firm conclusions on the date of the fire destruction described.14 Boardman stressed the possibility that 'the debris containing the most important finds had been much disturbed by later builders', accepting thereby the lack of pure deposits in various parts of the building. However, on the basis of the large amount of LM III pottery listed in Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933-4, he argued for the existence of a LM III destruction.13 Although this fire was responsible for destroying the building, carbonising much of the building's woodwork and baking the sealings, it was not responsible for the preservation of the tablets. Mackenzie's initial comment regarding the possibility of a tablet fragment having been found built into a rubble wall was indeed presented as evidence against the contemporaneity of the sealings and tablets. Boardman was also influenced by Evans's later statements where he disassociated the tablets from the sealing deposits. In addition to Mackenzie's statements regarding the Re-occupation date of the material, Boardman took into account Evans's comments on the late style of the seals used to impress the sealings. He therefore concluded that the tablets were baked in a first destruction, contemporary with the Palace. However, this event was followed by a second fire, which this time preserved the sealings. The second fire destruction was placed soon afterwards, but not as late as LM IIIB, since most of the seal impressions were not later than LM IIIA in style.16 Popham was the first to study the pottery. He published much of the LM IIIA and LM IIIB late pottery, acknowledging the existence of two distinct occupation levels. Furthermore, for the first time the difficulties in associating the LM IIIB vases with Mackenzie's references to Re-occupation pottery were emphasised: Evans's assistant may well have been describing what today is termed destruction rather than true Re-occupation material.17 THE LM III DEPOSITS: A RE-EXAMINATION Mackenzie often dated walls and other architectural features according to their quality of construction or general appearance. Characteristic are the NEP walls and the shallow drain E of the MUM Buttress (plan 13): both were considered inferior in construction, and thus associated with Re-occupation squatters.18 The rubble and plaster partitions along the E and N Sectors were likewise dated to the Re- occupation period, simply because they were seen as reflecting the LP occupants inferior standard of living in that period (plan 50). Despite the publication of several articles on Knossian pottery, by 1 905 Mackenzie and Evans were still at an early stage in understanding the local ceramic sequence.19 Consequently, the boundaries between Last Palace Style and re-occupation period pottery had not been clearly defined.

Pottery which today is acknowledged as contemporary with the LM IIIA 1/2 destruction of the Palace was incorrectly associated with the re-occupation period. Therefore the excavation notebooks remain a rather unreliable source of information regarding matters of dating.20 Mackenzie's dates of the LP architecture and pottery cannot be used as an argument in favour of a Last Palace or re-occupation period destruction in the building.21 There is no doubt that the wager system resulted in an oversimplification of the site's stratigraphy. The recent publication of the post-Minoan levels which lay above the MUM reflects how complicated the stratigraphy could have been above the LP.22 Signs of human activity above the Mansion dated from sub-Minoan to Late Roman, ranging from simple stone robbing of the Minoan masonry to urban occupation in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.23 Much of the earth which lay over the LP was hastily removed without recording. In certain parts of the site, post-Minoan activities had reached down to and within the level of the Minoan remains. Today, such areas are easily recognisable with the help of DM/DB, the Evans photographs and the preserved architecture: the post-Minoan levels above the LP must have risen rather abruptly to the w, as the hillside itself rises steeply in this direction.24 Above Room 7 the superimposed levels were rather shallow, as Mackenzie reported that only 1.10 m of deposits had to be removed before the red Minoan earth was reached. On the other hand, in the region of Rooms 28-31 and along the SW Sector, there was far more earth to be extracted: here the superimposed levels measured up to four metres (plate 8 b)P The extremely deep accumulation of later deposits above the MUM was one of the reasons why any further exploration of the Mansion was abandoned by Evans.26 Dense post-Minoan occupation levels were also traced along the E Front as a result of which the e end of the LP had been completely removed. The Hellenistic and possibly Roman levels had cut through the remains of the building on a nne-ssw line. The damage caused can be seen in plans 4-5 and plates 2 ¿z, 3 a-bP In 1908 Mackenzie commented that the foundations of Roman walls were regularly set deep into the Minoan levels along the sw part of the LP. Two wells had reached the LP ground floors, immediately s of Staircase 34 and within the se corner of Room 37 (plates 8 ¿, 7 ¿, g a).28 The circular wall found immediately N of Staircase 32 was probably part of a third well.29 Other areas, which were systematically robbed for their stone masonry, are recognised in the NW corner of the Basement and the area of the SE Court.30 Whether the E end of the N Facade was removed during Phase 6, when the dog-leg wall was constructed, remains uncertain (plan 9).31 Finally a Hellenistic house, whose remains extended above the MUM, must have overlain the W Storage Room Facade and was probably responsible for removing much Minoan masonry from this region (plates 8, 11 ¿).32 The location of the LP, set into the slopes of the hill, potentially offered protection to the Minoan remains from the effects of erosion. So if human disturbance was limited after the building had fallen into ruins, there were good chances for Evans and Mackenzie to find well-stratified deposits. Such was 20 Indicative is the pottery deposit found within Room 22: Mackenzie reported these as 'plain LM III cups', but study of the relevant SMK box (P. I. 4) proved them to be LM IA-type conical cups (plan 9, figs. 4.2, 4.3: 1-10). 21 An exception can be made when references to pottery are associated with individual vases which can still be identified. 22 Sackett 1992, 463-7 and pls. 2-4. -:i Sackett 1992, pls. 8-9, for example, showing in section the superimposed post-Minoan levels. 21 On plate 1 a-b the earth sections the north and south of the site are clearly visible. 25 At the far end of plate 8 b the workmen are removing the post-Minoan levels which lay above Room 36. 2(i These are clearly visible in plate 8 a; note the remains of the House of the Diamond Frescoes in the left corner; also Sackett 1002, pl. 6. 27 These post-Minoan levels seem to have been set within an artificial terrace cutting, which is clearly visible along the left end of plate 2 a. Evans reported a Hellenistic limestone relief and votive terracottas from this region: PM II, 5 1 7 n. 1 ; see also Hood and Smyth 1981, 48. 2* Platon reported that five Roman wells were cleared out in the LP site, of which only two are clearly identifiable on site. He reported on Roman pottery, as well as several fragments of Archaic pithoi, some with relief decoration. Amongst the small finds in the soils was a Minoan steatite seal (CMS II. 3 no. 14 / HM 1756). See Hood and Smyth 1981, 48; Platon 1956, 418. '"' The wall was briefly reported in DM/DB where Mackenzie seems to have been reluctant to associate it with the Minoan remains. A clue might be offered by SMK P. I. 10, said to come from the same region: it contains mostly post-Minoan sherds and makes it probable that the circular wall was indeed part of a post- Minoan well-lining. :M) Apart from the E half of the Basement, which was looted down to the foundations, the nw corner was also much affected by stone robbing (plate 4). The SE Court was another area where surrounding walls were extensively stripped of their masonry, with only foundation course preserved (plates 4 a, 13 a). In addition, a section of the S Facade had been removed down to its foundation course, as had most parts of the east end of the N Facade (plan ai, plates 2-*). 31 This dog-leg wall ran across the north end of Room 9, above the north wall of Room 14 and at least up to the doorway to Room 12 (plan 50). :i- Sackett 1992, pls. 2, 13; compare the levels of the Hellenistic house to those of the West Storage Room Facade and its poor state of preservation.</page><page sequence="203">1 94 THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS the case for much of the Minoan remains uncovered during 1905. Mackenzie had correctly recognised that the deposits of sealings and tablets had fallen from the upper floor, when this part of the building was destroyed by fire. Several factors support the concept of an upper floor collapse: the sealings were found scattered within eight different ground floor rooms, including Corridor 1 8, which had both its doorways blocked (plans 10, 50, 53). Those discovered in Rooms 17, 8 and 9 were recorded as found at about 1.20 m above the paved ground floor rooms. Several architectural elements such as doorjambs, a column base and gypsum paving were recovered from within the fill of Rooms 8 and 9, at levels ranging from 2 to 1.20 m above the paved floors (plan 15). The preserved architectural remains in the same region confirm that the structure had survived to a considerable height: Mackenzie noted that the walls of Room 19 were standing up to 2.40 m high, while an upper floor pier block, at the sw corner of Room 17, was found in situ and reconstructed as such (plates 8 ö, 10 a). The Minoan walls must have been equally well preserved in the area s of Room 1 7 and in the area of Staircase 32. Here, both Evans and Mackenzie used as a reference point an upper floor feature, namely the 'north landing of the staircase'. In the same region a gypsum pier block of the upper floor still stands in situ. Finally, Doll marked the position of an upper floor doorjamb along the nw corner of Room 31 (plan 17). Apart from the sealings, the most intriguing finds of the 1905 season were the objects of the so- called Fetish Shrine discovered in Room 17. Despite Mackenzie's remark that the half-complete horns of consecration (SF21) were found on the gypsum ledge, the distribution of the objects within the room, especially in relation to the largest of the fetishes (SF22), found in the adjacent Room 19, suggests that these too had fallen from the upper floor (plans 10, 21).33 This happy state of affairs as regards to the detailed recording was not maintained in the following excavation seasons. In spite of the wealth of objects discovered during the 1908 season, the notebook remarks on the nature of the deposits are disappointing and rather unhelpful. Mackenzie seems to have been confused over the nature of certain deposits either within the LP or between it and the MUM. He was ambivalent as to whether these had been disturbed by the last occupants of the LP, or during subsequent stone robbing and other post-Minoan activities. In light of the LM IIIA2 (or LM IIIB?) dating evidence provided for the two add-in walls in Rooms 29-30, Mackenzie's puzzlement is understandable (plans 50, 49, plate 15 b). The contents of Rooms 28-30 suggest that despite the LM IIIA2 or LM IIIB rebuilding, the earlier LM IIIA1/2 deposit was left at least partly in situ. The scattered distribution of the LM IIIAi ewer in Rooms 28 and 29 suggests that it had fallen from the upper floor (fig. 4.32: 4, plan 10). A similar argument can be presented as regards to the contemporary clay bull's head rhyton and the two alabastra, found in the area N of Staircase 34, although the evidence for or against is very slight (plan 12, fig. 4.32: 1, 4.32: 6).34 Of the different architectural modifications observed throughout the building, only those in the N and E Sectors can be more precisely related to the DM/DB descriptions regarding the nature of the Minoan deposits (plan 50). It has already been suggested in Chapter 3 that these modifications served no structural purpose; their function was to change circulation and lighting. In most parts of the Basement, the Central and SW Sectors, the walls were built of sizeable pieces of limestone masonry and did not require the support of vertical wooden beams. In the N and E Sectors the use of wood was, however, exceptionally abundant: wooden beams supported the upper floor, being either embedded as parts of rubble walls or used within pier-and-door partitions. Freestanding columns are also seen. There is evidence of at least 1 5 wooden columns in this part of the LP.35 Several of the blocking walls seem to have been thin rubble and plaster partitions, which, at least in certain cases, rested directly on the floor (platfs 2 ¿z, 5 fl, 6 a-b). In conclusion, the following observations can be made regarding the stratigraphy in the N and E Sectors of the LP, based on the combined evidence provided by the excavation notebooks and the building's architecture. The mere preservation of clay sealings presupposes a fire destruction: their scattered distribution indicates that it had wrecked quite an extensive part of the building. The sealings, the tablets and the 'Egyptian beans', together with the furnishings of the so-called Fetish Shrine seem to have fallen from the upper floor (plan 53). All these objects, together with various architectural " The different stratigraphical possibilities, based on DM/DB, have been outlined in Gesell inSrs, q*. M Less clear still are the data regarding the context in which the steatite bull's head rhyton was found. Its fragments were discovered within Pit A, located immediately s of Staircase 34, at 1 to 1.20 metres below the landing of the staircase. The architectural study of the region has argued that Staircase 34 could have accommodated an arrangement of two antithetically set upper flights. The pottery collected from the pit contains very few diagnostic sherds, which in general character seem to be of MM IIIB/LM I date. However, there are a few LM IIIA sherds which could be considered as intrusive. As a result, the rhyton could be associated with a MM IIIB/LM I, rather than a LM III, event within the building. :*r&gt; These are: the eight columns of the Peristyle (Room 7) (plate 3 b), the five columns of Room 1 7 (flan 2 1), one in Room 24/25 (flati: 14 c) and the two surviving column bases of Room 10 (plate 3 a).</page><page sequence="204">THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS 1 95 features, which collapsed as a result of the fire, prove that the upper floor was in full use at the time. Everything fell into the rooms below, some of which had been re-modelled prior to the fire destruction. The nature of these modifications, seemingly thin partitions resting on the paved ground floor, suggests that these were not built following an earlier destruction within the same part of the LP. Mackenzie was correct in suggesting that the earth debris, at least in those rooms which contained deposits of sealings, belonged to a single destruction caused by fire. There is no evidence to support the existence of an intermediate floor surface below the layer of sealings and above the paved floors. Unfortunately, the date of this destruction cannot be defined from the excavation notebooks, since not a single vase was reported from the E and N Sectors. Information regarding the date and nature of the deposits in other parts of the building is likewise often almost non-existent. Although the excavation of the Basement was well enough recorded, practically no details exist which would help to date a possible destruction or abandonment.36 The only area for which a more detailed picture can be obtained is the area of the Magazines (Rooms 28-30 and Staircase 34). Here the situation regarding information recorded in the notebooks is the reverse to that in the N and E Sectors. No direct reference to the nature of the Minoan deposits is made, but some LM III A event did happen and the clay vessels reported by Mackenzie were deposited in the ground floor rooms. The pottery retrieved from the rubble makeup of walls during the 1995 23rd Ephorate restoration work has been revealing. The discovery of LM II sherds in the re-built section of the W Facade and of LM IIIAi pottery from original-looking rubble walls along the N Sector provides a terminus ante quern for what must have been substantial rebuilding operations in this part of the LP. LM IIIAi sherds have also been retrieved from the mud-plaster and rubble partition wall constructed above the E balustrade in Room 17, thus providing a construction date for the radical re-modelling of several rooms along the N and E Sectors, assuming that these where roughly contemporary. Most importantly the LM IIIA1/2 pottery groups found by Evans within various rooms of the N Sector provide a terminus post quern for the sequence of events in the architectural history of the N and E Sectors. It is tempting to associate the repairs to the original walls with a LM II event in the LP, contemporary with either the penultimate or final LM II destruction in the MUM. In such a scenario, the total absence of LM II pottery from within the LP must, however, be explained by a thorough clean-up following such an event. What seems certain is that in LM IIIAi the LP was in need of substantial refurbishing. Walls were repaired or even rebuilt, after which the Minoan Halls were eliminated and other access systems blocked. More clues to the LP stratigraphical puzzle come from the SW Sector, particularly Room 36. A terminus post quern for the construction of the mudbrick wall C is produced by a c. 5 cm thick earthen layer, sandwiched between its rubble foundation course and an earlier earth floor in Room 36 (plans 44-5, plate 15 d). The earth layer preserved no traces of a fire destruction and contained LM IIIAi pottery, including one LM IIIA2 early type rim fragment (fig. 3.7: 10-22). Consequently, the sequence of events can be reconstructed as follows: in LM IIIA1/2 the earth floor of Room 36 was raised some 5 cm and a mudbrick wall was erected on a single course rubble foundation. Evans had identified this wall as two stacks of mudbricks, ready to be used for repairs along the upper floor of the SW Sector. He may not have been far from the truth, since the construction of wall C was contemporary with the refurbishing of the N and E Sectors. Equally revealing for the reconstruction of the sequence of events along the Central Sector has been the discovery of LM IIIA2 pottery (and possibly LM IIIB too) in the rubble makeup of the added walls in Rooms 29 and 30, which provide a terminus ad quern for their construction. Amongst the fragmentary pottery, which was built into the wall, is a sherd from a LM IIIAi pyxis, the fragments of which were scattered in different parts of the building (fig. 4.31 : 1). Preceding the erection of the added walls, some event occurred which caused the collapse of the upper floor, which contained a group of LM IIIA1/2 vases (fig. 4.32). It should be stressed that the latter deposit, together with pottery retrieved from these rubble walls, is more advanced in date than the material collected from walls along the N Sector. The sequence of events in the Magazines area can be reconstructed in the following way. An event, most probably a destruction by fire, caused the collapse of the upper floor. The LM III A 1/2 vases fell within Rooms 28-30 and along the space below the upper flight of Staircase ™ The only find reported was fragments of a larnax within Room 1, presumably of LM III date (plan 14). 37 The evidence of fire comes from the E wall of the Magazines (Rooms 28-^0). Here the soil used as bonding material had acquired a red terracotta colour.</page><page sequence="205">i c)6 THE LI 1 ILE FALAUL DEFUSH 5 34. S7 The subsequent clearout, which did not reach the original floor level of Rooms 29-30, was followed by the construction of the rubble walls abutting the original Magazine walls (plan 49). Finally the area was abandoned, not burned, since the soil used as bonding material was pale buff and not terracotta red, as it would be by the action of fire. Finally the evidence provided from the Evans pottery has to be combined with the excavation notebooks, architecture and the 1995 restoration work. The fair amount of post-Minoan pottery and small finds implies that the P. I. boxes could in some instances contain a mixture of material from true Minoan levels and later levels removed by the wagers. There is no doubt that the amount of material kept is only a fraction of what was originally found. Regrettably, there is no information regarding the method by which the pottery and small finds were collected and processed, either from levels dug by the wagers or from the Minoan deposits. Accordingly, the minimum number of complete vases cannot be used as a safe criterion in dating the LP fire destruction. Only five P. I. boxes come from parts of the LP which produced deposits of sealings. P. I. 10 contains mostly post-Minoan sherds and is of limited value. Its contents should be related to a post-Minoan well, sunk in the area w of the ground floor landing of Staircase 32 (plans 9, 50). P. I. 7, said to come from the area s of Room 17, regrettably must be considered unreliable, since its contents seem to have been mixed up with other boxes. Still, the box contains material, fair amounts of LM IIIA1/2 and LM IIIB late, which must derive from the area of Rooms 19-20, 23-24. The remaining four boxes are significant: pottery from Corridor 18 (P. I. 5) dates to LM ìli A 1/2, with the exception of a few LM IIIB late pieces (figs. 4.4: 6-9, 4.5, 4.6: 1); pottery from Room 22 (P. I. 4) and Room 20 (P. I. 6) is almost exclusively plain LM IIIA2 material (figs. 4.3: 19-21, 4.4: 1-5). Last but not least, the heavily burned pottery deriving from the space below the upper flight of Staircase 32 (P. I. 15) dates to LM IIIA1/2 (decorated sherds) and LM IIIA2 (plain pottery) (figs. 4.23-24). Evidence of a LM IIIB occupation of the LP comes from several P. I. boxes. The region w and nw of Staircase 32 is an area particularly rich in both LM IIIB late and LM IIIIA1/2. The existence of two occupation levels explains Mackenzie's comments on the difficulties encountered in trying to understand the region. In three instances, groups of LM IIIB pottery were kept separate: from the area of the Staircase 32 (P. I. 9, fig. 4.12), along the SW Sector (P. I. 12) and somewhere within the regions excavated in 1908 (P. I. GEN. #1458, fig. 4.28). Although both represented in large amounts, the nature of the LM III A pottery differs in some crucial aspects from the LM IIIB ceramic material: LM IIIA burnt pottery outnumbers by far the LM IIIB, whereas cross-joins are almost only amongst the LM IIIA material. Apart from a small number of fairly complete LM IIIB pots, the remaining material consists of single sherds dating to LM IIIB late. Such dissimilarities between the LM IIIA, the LM IIIB and LM IIIB late ceramic material imply different taphonomic processes at work. In conclusion: the quantities of LM IIIA, LM IIIB and LM IIIB late pottery strongly suggest that the site was inhabited in all periods and that a series of events resulted in stratified deposits. The presence of these three distinct pottery groups in various parts of the building complicates rather than simplifies matters. The question as to which of the two first was contemporary with the fire destruction along the E and N Sectors of the LP becomes a real issue. Here lies the heart of the problem of the 1 905 and 1908 excavation seasons: Mackenzie missed certain occupation levels. In the E and N Sectors, where the excavation records are more complete, the lost level, or levels, could have existed either somewhere between the ground floor and the deposit of sealings, which lay at about 1.10m above the floor, or at a much higher level above the main deposit of destruction debris. At first sight, the stratigraphical possibilities may appear to be several, especially since the incomplete excavation notebooks and the small amount of preserved pottery leave much ground for speculation. However, the method of excavation (especially in the 1905 season, when the wagers stopped at the burnt levels), the architectural properties of the E and N Sectors (where wood was abundant), as well as the notebooks (which show that once the burnt earth was reached, only one deposit was identified), are factors which suggest that the fire destruction is best associated with the LM IIIA 1/2 and LM IIIA2 pottery. Such an interpretation would match the evidence of an upper floor collapse in LM IIIA 1/2 in the area of the Magazines and explain the large number cross-joins amongst LM IIIA material as an upper floor collapse. It would also match the evidence of substantial groups of LM IIIA pottery, including burned sherds, in the Evans boxes and in particular from Rooms 18, 20, 22 and most importantly the burned pottery from the sottoscala of Staircase 32 (fig. 4.23). It would also imply that the fire was more widespread than Mackenzie recorded.</page><page sequence="206">THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS 1 97 FROM THE NEO-PALATIAL TO FINAL PALATIAL AND POST-PALATIAL PERIODS: THE HISTORY OF THE LITTLE PALACE A Pre-Little Palace Building? The west part of the Knossos town was densely populated in the Middle Minoan period; the earliest remains found at the nearby SEX site date to MM IA.38 Consequently, traces of earlier structures at the LP plot are only to be expected. Clearly there was a building in place before, but its characteristics are not clear. In general, these consist of undatable rubble walls visible roughly at the present earthen floor levels and usually running under the LP. Exceptional, however, are the remains of a pre-LP building equipped with monumental features such as the Early Facade and Causeway. The Early Facade rests on a stepped foundation course and strongly resembles architectural forms seen also in the Old Palace West Wing Facade at Phaistos. w Additional evidence for a pre-LP structure comes from traces of rubble walls associated with MM I II A pottery, which run below the south and west walls of Room 16. Although there is no physical evidence linking the rubble walls below Room 16 to the Early Facade, their e-w alignment together with the comparable lower level of the Early Facade suggest that both features could have been part of the same building. If so, the Early Facade building was abandoned in MM IIIA, an event roughly contemporary with the desertion of a house on the Acropolis slope, located south-west of the Palace, whose basement rooms where found choked with MM IIIA pottery.40 Any traces of re-building and occupation between MM IIIA and MM IIIB/LM IA were erased by the subsequent foundation of the LP. Construction, Occupation and Earthquake Damage: The Little Palace During the Neo-palatial Period Evans dated the construction of the LP to the 'New Palace Era', following the Great Earthquake.41 It was set into the terraced slope of the hill similar to the pre-LP Early Facade building, whose north- south orientation was maintained. Significant is the preservation of the Early Facade and the pre-LP building's entrance location, as suggested by the course and orientation of the Causeway. As part of the ambitious building programme which followed the destructive 'Great Earthquake', the LP repeats architectural features known from contemporary sections of the Palace, such as the Domestic Quarter, and several contemporary and luxuriously constructed houses at Knossos, namely the Royal Villa, S. E. House, South House, but also non-domestic buildings such as the Temple Tomb.42 The use of luxury building materials in classic 'palatial' type rooms such as the Minoan Hall and lustral basin, the pillar rooms and elaborate gypsum staircases, is noteworthy but not without parallel at Knossos.43 It is the overall size of the LP, with no fewer than 37 rooms at ground floor level, incorporating a maze of smaller rooms presumably used for storage, that makes this building unique amongst contemporary elite Neo-palatial buildings of the Knossos town. However, aspects of the LP's architecture such as its spacious 'palatial' types of rooms and its substantial storage capacity,44 large in comparison to other domestic contexts, bear no relationship to the vastness of the Palace, where the material expression of wealth and power is on a totally different scale. If architecture is considered as a medium for display of power, the LP, despite its name, is not comparable to the building Evans named it after. Restricted access and controlled circulation through a system of doorways, corridors and staircases is another feature characteristic of Minoan architectural design following Evans's 'Great Earthquake'. :w For MM IA remains at the SEX site see Warren 1 98 1 , 73; for contemporary remains opposite the modern entrance to the Palace: Hood and Smyth 1 98 1 , 50 no. 208; Warren 1994, 198. Minimal signs of an earlier building were also traced at the MUM in Rooms H, P, Q^and the South Corridor: MUM, 20, 78, 89 and 95. North of the LP, fine MM II pottery was discovered in the 1933 excavation during works at the BSA Taverna: Pendlebury and Money-Coutts 1933-5, V. 1933/1.

Despite the ample evidence of thorough re-building during various ceramic periods, the overall circulation patterns and division into different sectors seem to support the above statement. The ground floor divides neatly into independent quarters: a 'residential quarter' in the E Sector, with a lustral basin and more private rooms along the N Sector. To the south, the Basement with its pillar rooms and upper floor forms an independent quarter. A pillar room is also to be found in the SW Sector, an area of the LP approached independently from the SE Court. The Central Sector includes magazine-like storage rooms, but also a light well which was large enough to be used as a working space.45 Access to the upper floor was possible through Staircases 32 and 34, each one serving different sectors of the upper floor. The Minoan Hall, probably the most typical set of rooms in elite Minoan architecture, is seen here in one of its most elaborate forms. Occupying almost the total length of the E Front, Rooms 6, 7 and 8 effectively form 'double' Minoan Halls in relation to Rooms 10 and 7; an arrangement paralleled only at the Hall of the Double Axes in the Knossos Palace. There is a rich bibliography regarding the use of the Minoan Hall, but the view considering it as a residential area is the most compelling.46 Regularly in Minoan Neo-palatial design the Minoan Hall is in close proximity to the lustral basin, a room almost certainly used exclusively for religious purposes. The LP lustral basin resembles in plan that from the palace at Zakros.47 Following a lengthy debate over the function of this most enigmatic type of room, convincing evidence in support of a religious use for the lustral basin has come from Akrotiri, Xeste 3, area 3a, where a lustral basin is associated with frescoes depicting religious scenes.48 Although Evans identified Room 36 as a pillar crypt, its location and quality of construction argues against such an interpretation. The room has rubble walls, an earthen floor, lacks cists, and the two pillars, uneven in height, would have continued to the ceiling with a rubble and wood construction. This type of pillared room, which is located near the building's entrance and resembles Tylissos House A Rooms 16 and 17, can be identified as a room suitable for the storage of pithoi. Evans regarded the Basement as an important cult complex related to the steatite bull's head rhyton and the Causeway, which was supposed to provide the physical connection between the Basement and Room 3o.49 His interpretation should be treated with caution especially since the rhyton is associated with a foundation deposit at Staircase 34 and the Causeway with the pre-LP Early Facade building. Nevertheless, the function of the Basement remains difficult to ascertain, especially since evidence regarding the presence or absence of a doorway along the east exterior wall, which would have helped its identification as a storage space, is missing altogether; nor were storage vessels found within it. The first event in the history of the newly constructed building involves the disposal of the fragmentary steatite bull's head rhyton in Space 35 of the Central Sector. Space 35, or as it is better known from Mackenzie's excavation notebooks, Pit A, is a shaft-like feature, best paralleled in the drainage system of the Domestic Quarter. It was probably never used for drainage, since it does not lead to a drain outlet, and was transformed into one of the two spaces below the upper flight of Staircase 34. The steatite bull's head rhyton (SFi) was found at 1 metre down its preserved rubble walls. The MM IIIB/LM IA pottery which accompanied this magnificent object can be characterised as usual ceramic debris, giving no special character to the nature of the material which accompanied the stone rhyton. The bull's head rhyton was thrown broken into Space 35. If damaged intentionally, as suggested by Rehak, this precious stone object must have been laid as a foundation deposit50 Nevertheless, it emphasises the importance of the LP and possibly provides an insight into the quality of objects intended to be kept in the LM I building. Not long after the foundation of the LP, that is within MM IIIB/LM IA or early LM IA, construction of the nearby MUM was initiated.51 It remains unknown whether the work on the LP had already 45 The shape of Rooms 28-31 are self-explanatory regarding their use as storage rooms. The absence of storage jars or pithoi, a robust and usually long-used vessel, can be explained by the re-occupation of the Magazines in LM IIIA2 onwards. 46 Graham 1959; more recently Preziosi 1983, 32-50; McEnroe 1982, 3-7; Driessen 1982, 27-92.

It has been argued extensively that, even though the LP could have been conceived as one unit, the MUM was added later.52 The absence of Minoan Halls and lustral basins in the Mansion indicates that its main purpose was to offer additional storage space, working areas and living quarters. As for the unfinished Pillar Hall H in the MUM, its intended function was probably different from that of the LP pillared rooms. A drain outlet located along its east wall suggests that the space between the four pillars was meant to be open to the sky, which might offer a clue as to its intended function. Although the layout of the LP/MUM complex finds parallels elsewhere, such as Tylissos Houses A and B, its storage facilities signify its unique position, especially in relation to other domestic buildings at Knossos. In this respect the later LM III Linear B tablets and sealed goods, which were stored on the upper floor of the LP Palace, may reflect an ongoing tradition of storage facilities closely controlled or monitored by palatial administration. The next event which left its mark on the LP occurred at a time when LM IA pottery was in use. The deposit of LM IA conical cups found in Room 22 (figs. 4.2-4.3: i-8)implies that it became partly, if not completely, blocked off.53 It falls roughly within the same ceramic phase as the remaining LM IA pottery deriving from other parts of the LP, namely somewhere in the region of Room 1 9 and from the SW Sector.54 These mature LM IA pottery groups could be associated with the eruption of Thera or rather the earthquake which preceded that event. This earthquake horizon, known to have left its mark on Knossos most LM IA sites on Crete and is probably responsible for structural damage to several sections of the LP. Contemporary pottery, retrieved from LP rubble wall make-up, implies re- building within the same ceramic phase.55 The filling in of the lustral basin in Room 1 7 probably happened during LM IA on the basis of evidence from other Minoan houses.56 It is tempting to associate the LM I A pottery of box P. I. 7 with the lustral basin but any correlation has to remain entirely speculative. The fragmentary faience vessel with nautilus motif, the crystal inlays and the bronze 'corkscrews' reported by Evans probably belong to the fill of the sunken basin. The W Facade, although re-built in LM II or most likely LM IIIAi, could have been damaged by the LM IA earthquake. Evidence of repairs suggests that the LP remained occupied after the earthquake damages, or at least such was the intention of its occupants. In contrast, the completion of the MUM was interrupted and the building seems to have remained vacant during LM IB. The total absence of LM IB pottery from the LP indicates that it too escaped from the LM IB fire destructions, but does not answer whether it remained occupied throughout the period.57 The history of the LP in LM I conforms to the general picture from Knossos, including the Palace and several houses. The building suffered a serious but not disastrous destruction in LM IA, an event most likely to be associated with a tectonic earthquake preceding the Thera eruption. Although the compelling evidence for repairs at the LP implies that its occupants intended to re-inhabit, the absence of LM IB deposits cannot be securely interpreted as a sign of abandonment or only partial occupation during this period. Given the evidence for extensive repairs in LM IIIAi, it is most likely that the building was thoroughly cleared of any LM IB deposit during the succeeding LM II or LM IIIA period. Re-building and Destruction: the Little Palace during the Final Palatial Period lm ii and lm iiiai After the LM IB void, the LP/MUM neighbourhood became a very busy one from LM II onwards. Following some 50 years of abandonment the MUM was re-inhabited, after some constructional work had been carried out, which mainly consisted of laying out earthen floors in previously unfinished areas.58 Minor damage was caused by fire, which led to several architectural modifications, including the addition of retaining walls for the swept up destruction debris, the construction of a clay fireplace against one of the pillars in Room H and the blocking off of Corridor L.59 The LM II pottery retrieved 52 MUM; Hatzaki 1996; Hitchcock and Preziosi 1997; Poblóme and Dumond 1990. 33 Reported by Evans and Mackenzie but incorrectly dated to LM III. 54 P.

Other lustral basins which seem to have been filled in during LM I A are those of the South House at Knossos, Amnisos, and Houses A and C at Tylissos: Driessen 1982, 27 n.10; Driessen and Macdonald 1997, 59-61, 134, 149-50. 57 MUM, 261. 58 MUM, 261-2.</page><page sequence="209">2OO THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS from the rubble make-up of various MUM walls could belong either to the initial repairs or those following this subsequent minor fire destruction. Finally, within the same ceramic period the Mansion suffered from a fire, which ruined the entire building, after which occupation along the Central and South Sectors was never resumed.60 The nature of occupation in the LP at that time remains enigmatic, especially due to the absence of LM II pottery from within the building. However, a clue might be offered by the substantial repairs and modifications which took place in LM IIIAi. If these represent the aftermath of a LM II destruction, it would suggest that the LP was thoroughly cleared of its destruction debris, in a fashion similar to the North Sector of the MUM. Such an interpretation would explain the absence of LM II pottery from the LP and explain the substantial LM IIIAi repairs. In LM IIIAi, the LP underwent some serious re-building operations followed by extensive modifications to its original circulation and lighting plan, concentrated mainly along its N and E Sectors (plan 50). 61 In brief: a large section of the W Facade was re-built from its first ashlar course up; the floor in Room 14 was raised and equipped with a mini gypsum staircase; a rubble wall was added up against the original south wall of Room 1 1 ; the south walls of Rooms 1 9 and 2 2 were extensively repaired or rebuilt; and a free-standing mudbrick wall was erected in Room 36. Finally, outside the LP, the Paved Passage was blocked by a wall running over the NEP, which could have acted as a buttress to support the re-built section of the W Facade. Indeed, this was a very thorough repair job. Although there is no direct evidence to prove whether all doorways where blocked during a single building operation, they were certainly all in situ at the time when the LP was destroyed by the fire which preserved the sealings and tablets. Regardless of their construction date these alterations imply a drastic change in the use of certain rooms along the LP ground floor.62 The most striking changes, which no doubt puzzled the excavators and gave rise to the Re-occupation theory, were the elimination of the two Minoan Halls along the north end of the E Sector, the construction of a fireplace/hearth in Room 8, and the blocking up of the E balustrade in Room 17. The identification of this construction as a hearth or an oven remains problematic, since no objects associated with the ground floor were reported. Shaw has discussed in detail the possible uses of such constructions at Kommos and concluded that apart from culinary use, several pi-shaped hearths may have been used for metallurgical purposes.63 Closer to home, the use of the MUM LM II clay hearth remains open since the room was devoid of objects in close association. Popham, contrary to Catling, has doubted the possibility of it being used for metal smelting, since it would not have held a fire of sufficient heat.64 However, re-melting of copper-based objects remains a possibility. Changes in circulation, and at least partly of function, by blocking up several doorways in addition to the construction of a fire place in Room 8, could be interpreted as an attempt to accommodate within the LP facilities previously offered by the MUM. A shift to the LP ground floor of facilities offered by the LM II MUM may imply continuity of function fromLMIItoLMIIIIAi. Thirty years after the excavation of the MUM, the LM II destruction horizon emerges as a major event at Knossos, and a link with the subsequent LM IIIAi rebuilding operations is unavoidable. The SEX site excavations have confirmed that the sequence of events at the MUM was more widespread, at least throughout the west part of the Knossos town. Here too LM I buildings, such as the Gypsum and South Houses were refurbished and re-occupied only to be destroyed by fire within the same ceramic period.65 The South Front rubbish dumps, which contained fragmentary frescoes and LM II pottery that were thrown between the abandoned South House and the Palace, are one of the major deposits in favour of a substantial renovation of the Palace, following a possible LM II destruction.66 Popham distinguished a LM IIIAi re-building phase at the Palace and the South Front dumps were understood as part of this refurbishment.67 A re-assessment of the Room of the Chariot Tablets may also provide evidence of a roughly contemporary fire destruction within the West Wing.68 Driessen has linked the evidence from the kaselles and the Long Corridor, where LM II and LM IIIAi sherds :&gt;!l MUM, 262, pl. 3. t)(( MUM, 262-3. (il Although the pottery collected from the rubble make-up of various walls dates to LM IIIAi and provides only a terminus ante quern, there are no reasons to doubt that the re-building occurred within the same ceramic period.

Driessen 1990.</page><page sequence="210">THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS 20 1 were associated with building debris, with a LM II destruction in the Magazines.69 Recent soundings in the South Wing proved that the latest Palace walls were founded on top of plaster pits, which were found filled in with LM II pottery.70 The LM IIIAi refurbishing operations at the Palace provided the opportunity for a re-organisation of spaces and possibly a change of function. The most drastic shift in use can be seen outside the Palace at the SEX site where LM II occupation was abandoned, the area was levelled off and the Dancing Circles were constructed.71 In the LP neighbourhood, the North Sector of the MUM was patched up and re-occupied on both the ground and upper floor levels, the latter extending above the ground floor of Pillar Hall H, which was left choked with LM II debris. Naturally, the extensive repairs and modifications to the LP are part of a more general LM IIIAi building programme at Knossos, following a LM II fire destruction. For the LP, the cause for these building operations could have been a LM II destruction. Finally, a review of the LM IIIAi events at the adjacent MUM should be considered. Building debris containing LM IIIAi pottery fell or was tipped into the North Corridor.72 Although a secondary deposit with burned and fragmentary building material as part of the fill, Popham is emphatic that there were few signs of destruction by fire.73 The debris thrown into the North Corridor could have been the result of a clear-out following some structural damage to the Mansion. Popham links this to his early LM IIIA2 destruction horizon at Knossos, although he admits that the associated pottery from the North Corridor dated to LM IIIAi is stylistically earlier.74 Whether the debris in the North Corridor of the MUM should be considered contemporary with the LM IIIAi LP repairs or the subsequent early LM IIIA2 fire destruction remains unclear. One way or another, the Mansion seems to have escaped the subsequent and fierce fire which destroyed the LP. LM IIIAI AND LM IIIA2 Any attempt to reconstruct the sequence of LM IIIA and LM IIIB events observed at the LP inevitably touches upon the thorny subject of the destruction date of the Palace and its Linear B archive, or archives. The current re-examination of the LP has demonstrated the complex issues involved in unravelling the riddle of the Knossos stratigraphy and architectural phasing. The abandonment of the 'Unity of the Archives' theory together with the discovery of the Linear B tablets at Chania has revived the controversy regarding the destruction date of the Palace. Although it is beyond the scope of this study to re-evaluate the evidence in favour of a LM IIIA 1/2 or LM IIIB date for the destruction of the Palace at Knossos, Warren's documentation in favour of an LM IIIA2 destruction seems most consistent, at least from a stratigraphical and ceramic point of view. Warren brings a happy medium between Popham's LM IIIA 1/2 and Hood's early LM IIIB destruction horizon.75 Certain deposits from the Domestic Quarter are re-dated, on the basis of the SEX site pottery, to proper LM IIIA2 and are associated with Popham's LM IIIA 1/2 destruction deposits. The LP material supports a LM IIIA2 destruction horizon, when LM IIIA 1/2 pottery was still largely in use. In the LP the fire was so severe that it left signs of burning in all parts of the building, apart from the Basement area.76 The signs of fire were particularly evident in the area of Staircase 32 and in most parts of the E and N Sector. In subsequent excavation campaigns elsewhere at Knossos Mackenzie regularly compared the evidence of a fire destruction for the site under excavation with the intensity of the destruction which wrecked the LP. The power of the fire could have been intensified by the abundance of wood as a building material but also from the types of goods stored within the building. The fierceness of the conflagration and its wide distribution throughout the building makes human interference the most probable agent for setting the building on fire. The total absence of precious metals, common to all LM III destructions at Knossos, could have been the result of systematic looting.77 69 Driessen 1990, 117-18. 70 Momigliano and Hood 1994. 71 Warren 1982, 66-9; Warren 1984. 72 The absence of straight-sided LM IIIA2 type decorated cups amongst the published N Corridor pottery is noteworthy: MUM, pl. 172. The plain kylikes also seem to be exclusively of LM IIIAi types. However, amongst the illustrated plain pottery, there are three champagne cup feet which have to be considered as LM IIIA2 features: MUM, pl. 117 c.

The Linear B tablets and over i oo sealings provide evidence for administrative activity in the building, taking place somewhere above Rooms 7-9. Their distribution in eight different rooms of the ground floor, including both flights of Staircase 32, suggests that they were originally distributed within several upper floor rooms. It is tempting to associate at least some of the sealings with the two different varieties of beans, some of which were found in the remains of a wooden box, and stored above Room 8 and 9. Unless household food supplies, the beans could be taken as evidence of the storage of agricultural produce in the LP upper floor. The scattered distribution of the sealings was probably the result of the collapse of the upper floor. There could be other explanations for their dispersal: storage according to type or provenance, possibly even of bulky commodities, could be among the reasons for the distribution of goods in several upper floor rooms. Acceptance of the contemporaneity of the sealings and furnishings of the so-called Fetish Shrine is inevitable, since all were found mixed up together within the ground floor rooms. The distribution of the Fetish Shrine furnishings at roughly the same absolute level within Rooms 1 9 and 1 7 proves that they originally belonged to the upper story most probably above Room 17. The furnishings of the Shrine consisted of five stone concretions, a pair of horns of consecration and some animal figurines, which were found in the earth fill of Room 17. The largest of the fetishes had come to rest in the adjacent Room 19. Consequently, the Fetish Shrine should be completely disassociated from the filled in and re-modelled lustral basin. The close proximity of the Fetish Shrine to the sealings is an intriguing coincidence. Finally, the use of Room 1 7 with its blocked off E balustrade remains enigmatic. The same fire destruction also affected the Central and SW Sectors. Except for the area of Staircase 32, the fire seems to have caused less damage to the south-west part of the LP, since here the signs of burning are less striking compared to the N and E Sectors. Within the region of the Central and South West Sectors, wood was used in smaller quantities along the ground floor, except for Staircases 32 and 34. Several LM IIIA1/2 pottery groups came from this area.78 A contemporary but exceptional deposit was found in the Magazines and the area north of Staircase 34. It too had collapsed from the upper floor and included the ewer, the terracotta bull's head rhyton, the tall and squat alabastra, a piriform jar and possibly the papyrus Palace Style jar (fig. 4.32). Although some objects could have been stored in an upper floor cupboard, they still reflect the importance of the room located above the Magazines. If religious paraphernalia, separate and possibly different religious activities were taking place in this sector compared to those on the upper floor Fetish Shrine. The LM III A 1/2 and LM IIIA2 pottery, kept in the Stratigraphical Museum P. I. boxes and highly selected, can provide only a partial picture as to the types of vessels used at the time of the destruction. The most common vessel present amongst the selected and kept sherds is the decorated cup, presumably used for both drinking and eating purposes. Other shapes worth mentioning are the pyxides, a large basin, conical rhyta, collared jugs and piriform jars. The good quality of most decorated wares is universal at Knossos for LM III A and thus may not necessarily reflect directly on the status of the building's occupants. Although the standard of potting in most local workshops during LM IIIA1/2 was very high, the presence of a specialised group of material such as that located on the upper floor along the area of the Magazines is noteworthy. The fragmentary coarse- ware stirrup jars from the area of Room 2 2 suggest that oil or wine was stored, whereas the scant remains of tripod cooking pots from Room 20 imply food preparation. What remains to be considered is the cause for the LP fire. Naturally a link with the LM IIIA2 destruction seen in the Palace and other contemporary houses at Knossos is obvious.79 For the LP it is tempting to associate the architectural modifications, especially in the Minoan Hall, with 'Mycenaean' occupants. These alterations, however, may simply reflect a change in use of the ground floor of the building; possibly in the aftermath of the MUM LM II destruction. The presence of Greek speaking 'Mycenaean' populations at Knossos, from LM II onwards, is attested by the Linear B archives of the Palace and a series of new features in the material culture. Noteworthy is the existence of Mycenaean Greek and non-Greek names on tablets, which list personnel, such as the As series.80 The sealings and tablets attest that the LP had a special relationship to the Palace, a relationship that was undoubtedly different both from that of buildings such as the Arsenal, which produced a large archive deposit,81 ~H Noteworthy is P. I. 16, one of the best LM IIIA1/2 pottery groups, which came from the region nvv of Staircase 32. 7(1 Popham 19700; Warren iqqi¿/, 32-7.

E. House where no sealings or tablets were found.82 Apart from the tablets, which imply the presence of 'Mycenaean' administrators, the sealings reflect more on the practices of seal owners, who sent their goods to Knossos, rather than the occupants of the LP.83 In the sphere of religious practices the furnishings of the Fetish Shrine and the vessels found in the south-west part of the building reflect continuity in traditional 'Minoan' religious expression. This situation is paralleled at Knossos from LM II onwards and is best demonstrated at the 'Minoan' LM IIIAi Dancing Circles. Re-occupation and Abandonment: the Little Palace During the Post-palatial Period The considerable amounts of LM IIIB pottery kept in the Evans boxes of the Stratigraphical Museum affirms beyond doubt that the site was re-occupied. The nature and location on site of these occupation levels is, nevertheless, difficult to define. An obvious answer would be to associate the dog-leg wall of Phase 6 with the LM IIIB material, but no pottery was kept from Evans's excavation in the region. Since no other walls which could be associated with a post-destruction occupation survive, it has to be assumed that either the upper courses of the LP walls were re-used in LM IIIB, or that a separate structure was constructed above the ruined LP, but was hastily removed during excavation by the wager system. Scanty evidence from the area of the Magazines offers a clue, since here there is evidence of a re-occupation in the form of re-building with a terminus post quern of LM IIIA2, if not LM IIIB. In general, the ground and possibly upper floor walls in the south-west area of the LP must have been in a better state of preservation and more suitable for re-occupation. Wood, set as vertical beams within the ground floor walls, is here less abundant than in the E and N Sectors. This situation is mirrored in the similarly constructed North Sector of the MUM, which after the LM II destruction remained occupied until LM IIIB. The hearth in the S Court could be associated with a LM IIIB late re-occupation on the basis of large quantities of fragmentary pottery from this area. If so, the S Court may have been amalgamated into the patched-up LP and converted into an interior space. The small groups of LM IIIB late pottery from the N Sector suggest that some form of activities indeed did take place in this region. Acceptance of a LM IIIA2 date for the major fire destruction at the LP implies that re-occupation along the N Sector must have happened at a level above the upper floor collapse, which included the sealings, tablets and Fetish Shrine furnishings. Evidence for re-occupation comes primarily for the south-west region of the site but its character is only known from the surviving pottery, which includes a variety of shapes: plain champagne cups and shallow cups are the most common drinking vessels together with the decorated cup. Other shapes, represented by isolated examples include the collared jug and spouted shallow cup, the spouted tankard and the ladle. An octopus stirrup jar suggests storage of oil or wine.84 When the re-occupied rooms of the MUM North Sector were abandoned, very little pottery was left behind. These consisted mostly of plain open shapes and coarse-ware stirrup jars. It should be stressed that the decorated LM IIIB late sherds came from the North Platform pits and not from floor deposits within the Mansion. Whether a similar stratigraphical situation occurred at the LP as regards to the fairly complete LM IIIB vases and the highly fragmentary LM IIIB late sherd material remains an attractive hypothesis. It should be stressed that amongst the latter material the deep bowl and cup are more numerous than the kylix. The character of LM IIIB re-occupation of the Palace as defined by Mackenzie and Popham is best observed in the Shrine of the Double Axes and the South Terrace Basements.85 The Royal Villa, the S. E. House and the N. W. House seem also to have been partially occupied after LM IIIA1/2.86 For the LP the absence of stone and soil discoloration, which are the usual signs left behind by a fire destruction, in the Magazine walls, repaired and added in LM IIIA2, indicates that the area was abandoned rather than destroyed by fire. The reasons why the LM IIIB occupants of the LP abandoned the site is unknown. It is tempting, however, to associate this event with the abandonment of the re- occupied parts of the Palace and of surrounding houses. The nearby MUM seems to have been in a 82 PM II, 391-413. Any correlation of the LP sealings and tablets deposit to similar groups from the Palace and the Arsenal involves the tricky issue of dating each deposit. 83 Weingarten 1990, 112-3. 84 For the use of stirrup jars see Tournavitou 1002, 100-2. 83 Popham 1964 and Popham 1970Û. 8t' Popham 19700, pl. 17 d-f, 23 f, 41 d-g.</page><page sequence="213">2o4 THE LITTLE PALACE DEPOSITS bad state of preservation and the LP was probably in a similar and unsafe state. The decorated LM IIIB late pottery from the LP and the comparable material from the MUM North Platform pits are stylistically, and no doubt chronologically, close to the earliest pottery from the newly founded LM IIIC settlement at the nearby SEX site.87 It is quite possible that the last inhabitants of the LP and MUM abandoned their deteriorating dwellings and moved to the SEX site only a few metres further west or to another area close by, as yet unexcavated. As with the Mansion, the LP may not have been deserted for long before it came to be used as a stone quarry. Gradually, the once great Minoan LP at Knossos became covered by later levels of occupation, beginning an entirely new phase in the site's history. 87 Compare the LP and MUM LM IIIB to the decorative motifs on bowls in Warren 1983, 79, fig. 41, 81, fig. 47 and 82, fig. 48-9.</page><page sequence="214">References JOURNALS AND SERIES AA Archäologischer Anzeiger.
