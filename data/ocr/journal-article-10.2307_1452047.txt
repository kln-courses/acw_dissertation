<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOODENOUGH'S BY LIGHT, LIGHTI PHILO is one of the most complicated Jewish thinkers of the Hellenistic world because he drew his information from many sources which often belonged to different and opposing civilizations. Thus it is only when one is well versed in the Greek, Hellenistic and Jewish forms of culture that he can reconstruct systematically Philo's ideas and give a comprehensive understanding of Philo's work. Students of Philo may consider themselves fortunate that such a task has been undertaken by Prof. Goodenough who has long established for himself a great reputation in this field. But Dr. Goodenough's new book, entitled By Light, Light, is not only a profound analysis of Philo's work, but is also an attempt to ascertain the religious value of the Hellenistic mysteries and an endeavor to determine whether the Hellenistic Jews were influenced by the pagan mysteries or whether the Jews kept their oriental theology intact and escaped the non- Jewish form of worship. First Prof. Goodenough claims that the Hellenistic mysteries were not, as commonly thought, anthropomorphic cults. The myths of Osiris and Isis and the Orphic cult were merely the symbol of meta- physical truth. The Hellenistic philosophers adapted their rational concepts to Greek mysteries and used them as a basis of emotional experience. Thus the Hellenistic world sought through mystic experience a path to ultimate reality, which is infinite and essentially beyond relation with the universe because of the limitations of matter. The myths became a typology and the mystic experience became the paramount element in religion. Second, Dr. Goodenough claims that Philo was also influenced by Orphic mysteries and that he allegorized or "mysticized" the biblical narratives in the same manner as Plutarch did the Egyptian cult of Isis. The infinite became the god of the Streaming Sophia; Moses became the priest, hierophant, and lawgiver; and the personalities of the patriarchs were interpreted as symbols of a higher and lower 1 By Light, Light.

All the incidents related in the Pentateuch are interpreted as symbols of the mystic road to God through Sophia. Such a mystic theology could have developed only if Judaism was already recognized as a mystic cult. Mystic Judaism was not invented by Philo but Philo infused a philosophy into the Jewish mystery as Plutarch has done to the Greek mysteries. Thus Dr. Goodenough writes: "After Judaism had, at least in its own eyes, been recognized as a religion offering a way to mystic objectives in conscious comparison with the other mysteries, it could go on to represent itself as the only true mystery, and deal with its own mythology and mystic philosophy without further reference to its competitors" (p. 10). The writer seems to be convinced that the Jews had their mystic initiation, baptism, like the Christians later, and a "sacred table" (p. 8; see also pp. 256-264). Thus, according to Prof. Goodenough, the writings of Philo reveal that Alexandrian Judaism was a transformation of normative Judaism into a mystic cult similar to the Greek mysteries. I believe that Prof. Goodenough's main contribution is his profound analysis of Philo's allegories and with his interpretation of Philo's mystic philosophy we all can agree. It may be doubted, however, whether he has proven his point that the religion of Philo and of the Alexandrian Jews was a mystery religion parallel to the Hellenistic mysteries, and that Hellenistic Judaism was the triumph of Greek mysticism over Jewish religion. When one studies Philo he is bound to answer two questions: 1) What was Philo's philosophy? 2) What was Philo's cult or religion? Dr. Goodenough has well illustrated that Philo's philosophy is based on Platonic and Neo-Pythagorean sources and that by this combination Philo endeavored to reconcile the notions of a personal and impersonal God. But Dr. Goodenough seems convinced that a mystic philosophy depends a priori on a mystic cult. This assumption is open to question. Philo's religion was essentially Jewish and, as Dr. Goodenough himself points out (p. 83), Philo denounced in the most severe terms the extreme allegorists who abrogated the law and looked upon the Bible only as an allegory. (Mig. Ab., 89-99). It is highly probable, insofar as our evidence goes, that even the extreme allegorists who abrogated the biblical law merely constituted a reform movement within historic Judaism but did not form a separate mystic cult. When philosophers like Plutarch infused philosophical concepts into the mysteries, the mythologies became 280</page><page sequence="3">GOODENOUGH'S BY LIGHT, LIGHT-BELKIN typologies, but to Philo the Bible in its literal meaning remained the revealed word of God and in the actual application of the biblical law he differed in no respect from the Palestinian Jews. In the treatise Ad Caium Philo pays the highest compliments to the Palestinian Jews for their faithful observance of the law. There is no reason or evidence to believe that the Alexandrian Jews had a mystic initiation and a sacred table such as found in the mystery religions. Philo does not even mention any form of initiation for proselytes. The fact that Philo's mystic philosophy was similar to the philosophy which the educated pagans infused in the mystery cults does not necessarily prove that the Hellenistic Jews practiced a mystic cult at any time. Thus Philo's allegories belong to the domain of philosophy and can hardly prove what was the nature of Jewish worship in Alexandria. One may therefore doubt the validity of Prof. Goodenough's affirmative answer to the question: "Did his synagogue (the Jew's) too tend to become a OLaaoos and his whole tradition a typology of mystic philos- ophy?" (p. 5). Again Philo's mystic philosophy may not be Jewish, still it is not contrary to Judaism, since in Philo's system the belief in God's revelation to the Jews and the belief in a monotheistic deity remained paramount. I also wish to question Dr. Goodenough's theory in ch. 3 that Philo was a Sadducee and hardly knew anything about the oral tradition. His claim is based on the fact that Philo repudiates determinism, and makes no reference to resurrection; his angels are only the avvad'eLs of God and he concentrates his labors primarily on the Pentateuch. I believe that G. F. Moore (Judaism, I, 458) and Dr. Goodenough have exaggerated Philo's doctrine of free will and the Pharisaic belief in determinism. The conception of &amp;eL/ap/eivr/ appears in Philo's works in many places. Philo only opposed those who believed that the good and evil conduct of man can be determined by Fate (Mig. Ab., 179-180). Such a conception of determinism was also not accepted by the Pharisees (see Abot 3.15; Ber. 33b; Hul. 7b; Niddah 16b). Josephus' various accounts of the disagreements between the Sadducees and Pharisees with reference to et,uap#evrn is very confusing and disappointing. The fact that Philo makes no reference to resurrection is a negative argument, but Philo could have hardly anything in common with the Sadducees who believed that the soul perishes with the body. Philo is not the only Jewish philosopher who did not interpret 281</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW literally the anthropomorphism of angels. And finally, we have no evidence that the Sadducees considered the Pentateuch to be the only revealed word of God (see Contra Apionem, I, 37-42). A Sadducee could hardly have made sense of Philo's allegories and midrashic comments. Prof. Goodenough has also some very illuminating discussions of the mystic philosophy in non-Philonic sources (pp. 265-358). His analysis in chapter 11 of the possibility that there may be a mystic Jewish source for the liturgy of the Apostolic Constitution is very convincing. The discussion of the mystery in the Kabbalah is, however, based on secondary material and is not as informative as the rest of the book. In conclusion, we may say that Prof. Goodenough's book as a whole reveals the author's mastery of the field of Hellenistic and Greek literature and his extensive knowledge is blended with an unusual power of critical analysis. The contribution of the book is manifold. First, it gives a systematic and profound understanding of Philo's allegories, and henceforth it will be impossible for any serious student to study Philo without detailed consideration of the author's investi- gation. Second, New Testament scholars will now be able to determine with greater accuracy how much early Christianity was influenced by Philo's mystic philosophy. Whether Philo's mystic philosophy depends on a prior Jewish mystic cult can not be decided until more positive evidence is available. It is to be hoped that Prof. Goodenough will discuss the matter in the subsequent volumes which he has promised. OESTERLEY'S GOSPEL PARABLES2 THIS book consists of a series of lectures on the forms and applica- tions of the Gospel Parables. The author believes that one of the reasons why there is such a great diversity of opinions concerning the central truth and doctrinal significance of the Gospel Parables is the fact that scholars have often neglected to study the parables from the point of view of their Jewish environment. The author, therefore, analyzes the parables in the light of the conditions, customs and traditions which 2 The Gospel Parables in the Light of their Jewish Background. By W. O. E. OESTERLEY.
