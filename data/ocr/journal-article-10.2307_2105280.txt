<plain_text><page sequence="1">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE The contemporary scene in the field of philosophy is characterized by intellectual segregation. The empiricists and existentialists stand over against one another, with only a few thinkers attempting to integrate the two. In spite of this ideological bifurcation, there is an essential unity which underlies the entire contemporary scene, and which often goes unnoticed. No matter how divergent and opposed these two major movements are, they are both agreed that a qualitative distinction must be made between the two main areas of human experience and reality. This distinction is variously expressed as one of science or morality, fact or value, cognitivity or non-sense, and knowledge or mystery. The empiricists maintain that only that aspect of reality and experience which can be conceptualized and confirmed is of real significance. The exist- entialists maintain that only that aspect of reality and experience which deals with human emotions and values is of real significance. In short, both movements agree on the dichotomy between fact and value, or knowledge and mystery, but each focuses on a different aspect of this dichotomy. This divided-but-utited situation is reflected in the contemporary dis- cussion surrounding the question of religious knowledge. Confessionally- oriented theologians (following the Barthian tradition) and existentially oriented theologians (following the Bultmannian tradition) both work under the assumption that religious awareness and faith are not related to conceptual cognitivity in an essential way. Although there are signs of renewed interest in religious cognitivity among "analytic theologians," the most popular position is still the one based upon the work of S~ren Kierkegaard. The "infinite qualitative distinction" between knowledge and faith which pervades Kierkegaard's thought continues to dominate the contemporary scene. Moreover, a case can be made for the position that Kierkegaard's distinction between knowledge and faith is closely related to a similar distinction in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In the following discussion I will summarize the positions of these two thinkers with an eye to exemplifying this similarity. 188</page><page sequence="2">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 189 I Kant inherited his philosophical problems from his intellectual ances- tors. Having been thoroughly schooled in, and convinced of, the ration- alistic views of Leibniz and Wolff, Kant was rudely awakened from his "dogmatic slumber" by the profundity and precision of David Hume's thinking. 1 Hume had put an end to the high hopes of both the con- tinental rationalists and the British empiricists. The former sought, and claimed to have found, an epistemological foundation for all knowledge and reality in the necessary conclusions deducible from self-evident truths. The latter sought, and claimed to have found, such a foundation in the probable conclusions "inducible" from sense impressions. Hume followed the empiricist approach more thoroughly than his predecessors and was able to demonstrate that neither deduction nor induction can provide an adequate foundation for knowledge. Deduction, with its "self-evident" premises, turned out to be definitional (analytic) and empty of factual content, while induction proved to be based upon the unjustified assumption that the future will be like the past. Thus Hume had eliminated the possibility of factual truth claims in mathematics, science and metaphysics. Kant was convinced of the validity of Hume's reasoning, but at the same time he was aware that mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical knowledge form a vital part of the human situation, and seem to be quite well established. The question which serves as the focal point of Kant's philosophy is: "How are mathematical, scientific and metaphysical knowledge possible?" 2 In other words, since such knowledge is a reality, what must be the case in order to account for its existence? The answer which he worked out not only serves as a synthesis of rationalism and empiricism, but represents a profound epistemological revolution which Kant himself likened to Copernicus' astronomical revolution.3 Kant's epistemology, set forth in his Critique of Pure Reason, is based on the belief that knowledge is composed of two aspects, namely content and form. With the empiricists he maintains that the content of knowl- edge is supplied by sensory experience, but in harmony with rationalism he maintains that the form (or structure) of knowledge is supplied by I Hume, David.

Kant asserted that the mind plays an active part in the knowing experience by imposing upon the data of sensation certain fixed "categories." Thus what is known is sensory experience after it has been "filtered through," or organized by, the built-in categories of the under- standing. Both of these elements are necessary, but neither is sufficient, for knowledge to take place. But, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means follows that all arises out of experience. For, on the contrary, it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself (sen- suous impressions giving merely the occasion), an addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given by sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in separating it.4 Although no sensations of these categories are possible, we do possess "ideas" of them. The concepts of space, time and causation5 are per- haps the most crucial and will have to suffice as examples in this brief discussion. Concepts such as these are common and essential in ordinary and theoretic understanding, and yet they have no content of their own, i.e., they cannot be perceived. Rather, according to Kant, they are the very framework by means of which objects can be experienced and understood. Moreover, because of their all-pervasive, categorical nature, these concepts can be said to yield necessary (a priori) and factual (synthetic) knowledge.6 All human experience and knowledge must be characterized by space, time, causation, etc., since these comprise the very nature of the human mind. Thus statements involving these con- cepts are both necessarily true and factually significant. This necessary-factual, or a priori-synthetic, knowledge provides an answer, according to Kant, to the crucial question, "how is knowledge possible"? Mathematical and scientific knowledge find their basis and justification in the categories of the understanding, since the latter are the necessary conditions of human thought. Geometry, which is de- pendent upon the category of space, and arithmetic, which is dependent upon the category of time (sequence), yield a knowledge which is necessary, but not empty of factual content. In like manner, science, which is dependent upon the category of causation as the basis of in- ductive inference, yields a knowledge which guarantees that future experiences will follow a causal pattern similar to that of past expe- riences. Kant was convinced that a priori-synthetic knowledge, based on 4 Ibid., p. 14 (Introduction,, Sec. I). 6 Ibid., pp. 24-33 (Trans. Doc. of Ele., Part I, Secs.

I, Book I).</page><page sequence="4">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 191 the categories of the understanding, provides a thorough and final answer to the problems raised by Hume. To put the whole matter another way, Hume had maintained that 1) all statements that are known to be true apart from experience (a priori) are also analytic (definitional), 2) all statements that have factual content (synthetic) are only known to be true on the basis of experience (a posteriori), therefore 3) all significant statements are either a priori-analytic or a posteriori-synthetic, and finally 4) since a priori*- analytic statements make no factual claims and a posteriori-synthetic statements unjustifiably assume causal inference, knowledge claims are without justification. Kant, on the other hand, replied that since the categories of the understanding are necessary to explain the fact of human knowledge, and since these categories yield concepts which are both necessary and factually significant, there must exist a priori-syn- thetic statements which provide a sound basis for knowledge claims. One example of an a priori-synthetic statement is all that can be given in this brief survey of Kant's thought. This example is one of Kant's favorites.7 The mathematical proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is both necessarily true and factually significant, since its truth can be deter- mined apart from experience (a priori), but it actually says something about the world of experience (synthetic). It is not analytic, since 12 is not part of one's mental conception when one thinks or says 7 + 5 and it is not a posterior, since its truth is not dependent upon the experience of actually counting objects. 7 + 5 = 12 is a priori-synthetic because it is based upon the mental category of sequence (time). The serious logical shortcomings of Kant's understanding of mathematics will have to be overlooked in this exposition. Kant's account of metaphysics does not conclude with the same positive results as his account of mathematics and science. Since both mathematics and science are attempts to conceptualize about the world of sensory experience (phenomena), their use of the categories of the understanding is quite appropriate. The results of the application of these categories to the phenomenal world are reliable because the phenomenal world actually derives its reality from the categories in the first place. Metaphysics, however, is traditionally defined as the study of reality as it really is (noumena), apart from the limitations of sensory experience - the study of reality in and of itself (ding an sich). In such an endeavor, it is clear that the application of the categories of the mind would be completely inappropriate, since these phenomenal categories would distort one's understanding of the noumena in the same way that 7 Ibid., p. 18 (Intro., Sect. V).</page><page sequence="5">192 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH dark green sunglasses distort one's perception of color. But if these categories of the understanding, which comprise the human intellect, cannot be used in metaphysics, what categories can be used? Clearly none, for these are the only mental categories man has at his disposal - man's knowledge is limited by the nature of his intellect. Thus Kant concludes that metaphysics, as it has traditionally been conceived, is strictly impossible. All conceptions, therefore, and with them all principles, however high the degree of their a priori possibility, relate to empirical intuitions, that is, data towards a possible experience. Without this they possess no objective validity, but are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or notion.8 Kant devotes a good deal of space to a discussion of the mistakes and confusions which result from the abortive attempt to transcend the categories of the understanding by conceptualizing about the noumenal world.9 Instead of transcending the categories, one actually ends up applying them to themselves, which in turn results in either empty abstractions or anthropomorphic hypostatizations. The history of phi- losophy is replete with examples of both. Kant mentions three such mistakes, and classifies them as "The Psychological Idea," "The Cos- mological Idea," and "The Theological Idea." '1 The first is a result of applying the category of "substance" to the noumena in order to obtain the concept of a soul, or self. The second is a result of applying the category of "causation" to the noumena in order to construct a concept of the world. The third results from applying the category of "possibility" to the noumena by way of constructing a concept of God. It is on the basis of the inapplicability of the categories of the mind to the noumenal world that Kant develops his profound criticisms of the traditional arguments for God's existence. The ontological and causal arguments are impotent because they attempt to arrive at conclusions about reality beyond the phenomenal world by means of the categories of phenomenal knowledge and experience. Thus they become pure abstractions, empty of factual (existential in the logical sense) content. There are, of course, other logical reasons which Kant offers in criticism of such arguments, but this is not the place to review them. Kant states his conclusion thus: Now I maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology by the aid of speculation alone are fruitless, that the principles of reason as applied to nature do not conduct us to any theological truths, and consequently, that a 8 Ibid., p. 94 (Trans.

For all synthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanent in experience; while the cognition of a Supreme Being necessi- tates their being employed transcendentally, and of this the understanding is quite incapable." Traditional metaphysics is, then, impossible. Nevertheless, Kant real- ized that thinkers will continually be tempted to apply their reasoning powers beyond their limits, and that the "metaphysical urge" is here to stay. To cope with these two facts, Kant offered two suggestions. First, he wrote a shortened and simplified version of his epistemological analysis entitled, Prolegomena To Any Future Metaphysics, in which he advised thinkers not to bother themselves with traditional metaphysics, since it is a strict, logical impossibility. Second, he proposed that the term 'metaphysics' be "recoined" so as to refer to the analysis of the nature and limitations of human thought - following Kant's own example! Critique, therefore, and critique alone contains in itself the whole well-proved and well-tested plan, and even all the means, required to establish metaphysics as a science; by other ways and means it is impossible.'2 Kant's account of morality is set forth in his Critique of Practical Reason. The type of reasoning employed in matters of ethics is not speculative (with conceptual understanding as its goal), but rather it is practical (with moral action as its goal). 13 Although this type of reasoning is not subject to conceptual categories, it is subject to the categorical imperative of duty. Each and every man is confronted with the imperative, "Do your duty," and whether a particular decision is moral or immoral is determined solely on the basis of whether or not it was made in response to this call of duty. For Kant, an imperative to do one's duty necessarily implies the freedom to be able to do one's duty. It was upon this foundation of personal freedom that Kant built his entire system of moral and educational excellence. The line that Kant drew between pure (speculative) and practical (moral) reason was clear and impassable. There were at least two important reasons for drawing the line in this way. First, it enabled Kant to isolate and thus delimit the nature and limitations of speculative 11 Op. Cit., Pure Reason, p. 191 (Trans. Doc. of Ele., Book II, chap. III). 12 Op. Cit., Prolegomena, p. 114 (solution). 13 Kant, Immanuel. The Critique of Practical Reason. Translated by T. K.

Second, it enabled Kant to establish moral philosophy and action on an independent and autonomous basis. Others had suggested similar distinctions before him, but none had worked out the dichotomy between fact and value so thoroughly. Here is the cornerstone of nearly all of contemporary philosophy. "The theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the cognitive faculty.... It is quite different with the practical use of reason. In this, reason is concerned with the grounds of determination of the will." 14 Kant's account of religion, unsurprisingly, fits smoothly into the epistemological and moral dichotomy outlined in the foregoing discus- sion. Traditionally, religion had found its basis in the realm of knowl- edge, and more particularly in the field of metaphysics. The claims of religion were construed as knowledge claims about ultimate (noumenal) reality. This approach not only led to insoluble conflicts between inter- pretations,15 but it left religion open to the criticisms of logic and science. By delineating the phenomenal limits of knowledge claims, Kant rendered this view of religion entirely sterile. The end of metaphysics meant the end of religious speculation and/or theology. But far from considering himself the enemy of religion, Kant conceived of himself as its chief benefactor. By making a thorough and clear distinction between speculative reason and practical reason, he had provided religion with a basis in the moral realm, which not only removed it out of range of intellectual criticism, but allowed it to focus on its primary business as well. Religion's main concerns are, according to Kant, obeying God and serving mankind, and these have to do with morality, not knowledge. Although his critiques make some mention of this conclusion,'6 Kant worked out its implications most thoroughly in his Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone. Herein he makes a distinction between a reasoned and a revealed religion. The former is based on practical reason and is primarily concerned with morality, while the latter is based on historical facts and is primarily concerned with doctrines and practices. Moreover, only the former can be universal, since it is based on the moral imperaitve which every man experiences, while the latter is based on special information which is limited to a few. One of the main concerns of Kant's Religion is to develop the relationship between his moral religion within the limits of practical reason and the Christian religion set forth in the Scripture. He maintained that when men 14 Ibid., p. 296 (Intro.). 15 Referred to by Kant as "Antinomies." 116 Op. Cit., cf. Pure Reason, p. 190 (Trans. Doc. of Ele., Book II, chap. III, sec.

V).</page><page sequence="8">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 195 ,fulfil their duties to men (themselves and others) they are, by these very acts, performing God's commands and are therefore in all their actions and absten- tions, so far as these concern morality, perpetually in the service of God, and that it is absolutely impossible to serve God more directly in any other way (since they can affect and have an influence upon earthly beings alone, and not upon God).'T One final point remains to be discussed in this survey of Kant's thought. Once having separated knowledge and morality, and having identified religion with the latter, Kant allowed himself to conjecture concerning the implications of his view of religion. It has already been mentioned that he was convinced that the imperative nature of moral duty implies individual freedom. In addition, Kant maintained that the moral imperative of duty implies personal immortality and the existence of God.18 Since man is faced with the moral imperative to become a person who does his duty, in short a virtuous person, it is only reason- able (from a practical standpoint) to "postulate" the continuation of life after death and the existence of an eternal, all good God. The former (immortality) is necessary to allow sufficient time to achieve the desired virtue, and the latter (God) is necesary to serve as the ground and standard of the desired virtue. Beginning with the experiential fact of moral responsibility, Kant reasoned to opportunity (immortality) and justice (God). If a man is to be held responsible, he must be provided with the opportunity of achievement, and there must be a source and standard of achievement. On the other hand, a requirement of pure practical reason is based on a duty, that of making something (the summum bounm) the object of my will so as to promote it with all my powers; in which case I must suppose its possibility and, consequently, also the conditions necessary thereto, namely, God, freedom, and immortality ... but the subjective effect of this law, namely, the mental disposition conformed to it and made necessary by it, to promote the practically possible summum bonum, this pre-supposes at least that the latter is possible, for it would be practically impossible to strive after the object of a conception which at bottom was empty and had no object.'9 This is Kant's famous "moral argument" for the reality of God and immortality. The terms "imply," "necessitate," "argument" are used in a qualified sense. In no sense can these considerations be considered as t- Kant, Imanuel. Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone.

Nonetheless, they are practical implications of the moral life which establish the reality of religion in the only way it can, and needs to be established. It is in this way that Kant claimed to have "abolished knowledge in order to make room for belief."20 II Kierkegaard inherited his philosophical problems from Hegel. Con- trary to what might have been excepted, Kant's philosophy did not put an end to traditional metaphysics. In almost no time at all philosophers were maintaining that the elements and categories of human under- standing actually reflect the structure and nature of the noumenal world. Thus the analysis, or critique, of human speculative reason which Kant had championed was turned into the key which unlocked the secrets of reality. The systematic philosophy of Hegel represents the climax of this new path into metaphysics. Hegel's "Absolute Idealism" unites the nature and structure of the mind (Idealism) with the nature and struc- ture of transcendent reality (the Absolute). The originality, profundity, and comprehensiveness of Hegel's philosophy made it the most influential ideology of the nineteenth century. It even effected a marriage between philosophy and Christian theology! In his Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard analyzes the epistemology of idealism, contrasting it to that of New Testament Christianity. He concludes that the marriage between the two, is a mistake and must be annulled. It is my contention that in his attempt to overcome the Hegelian identification between idealistic philosophy and Christian the- ology, Kierkegaard relied upon an epistemological position essentially similar to that of Kant. That is to say, he espoused an absolute dichotomy between knowledge and faith, and assigned religion to. the realm of feelings and morality. Before embarking upon a summary of his reasonings in the Fragments, this quote from his Journal will be offered as initial substantiation of the above claim: But such a scientific method becornes especially dangerous and pernicious when it would encroach also upon the sphere of spirit. Let it deal with plants and animals and stars in that way; but to deal with the human spirit in that way is blasphemy, which only weakens ethical and religious passion. Even the act of eating is more reasonable than speculating with a microscope upon the functions of digestion.... A dreadful sophistry spreads microscopically and telescopically into tomes, and yet in the last resort produces nothing, quali- tatively understood, though it does, to be sure, cheat men out of the simple, 20 Op. Cit., Pure Reason, p. 10 (Preface to the second edition).</page><page sequence="10">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 197 profound and passionate wonder which gives impetus to the ethical.... The only thing certain is the ethical-religious.21 In the first chapter of Philosophical Fragments Kierkegaard sets forth the idealist epistemology and contrasts it to that of New Testament Christianity. Classical idealism maintains that knowledge is obtained by rational, introspective dialectic. Plato's doctrine of "recollection," Des- cartes concept of "intuition," and Hegel's doctrine of "the truth as the whole" all exemplify this approach. The presupposition which underlies such doctrines is that knowledge is a matter of the learner becoming aware of that which is already within him.22 In other words, there is an essential unity between the knower and ultimate reality, which enables the mind of the former to reflect the latter - even though this unity is very often hidden behind the vicissitudes of sensory experience. The logical corollary of the foregoing position is that time, history, and individual existence must be viewed as nonessential and irrelevant to truth and knowledge. All such factors become mere accidental "occa- sions" for the reflecting of eternal truth.23 To put it differently, the original relationship between the mind and reality is said to be one of harmony and continuity, with particulars simply serving to disclose this unity to the knower. Over against this view Kierkegaard sets an alternative view which maintains that time, history and individual existence are essential in coming to the knowledge of truth. Although he introduces this view as a tentative "thought project," Kierkegaard takes this to be the epis- temological position of New Testament Christianity. The underlying presupposition of this approach is that knowledge is a unique achieve- ment which actually effects something in the learner which was not there previously. The particular temporal experiences of the existing individual thus become extremely important as decisive media of knowl- edge.24 In this position the original relation between the mind and reality is one of discontinuity, with particulars serving to bridge the gap between the two. In this dichotomy between the mind and reality one can see marked similarities to Kant's epistemology; Kierkegaard spends a good deal of time in the latter part of chapter one and in chapter two developing some of the theological implications 21 Volume VII (1846), A, 186.

Swenson, p. 11. 23 Ibid., pp. 13 ff. 24 Ibid., pp. 16 ff.</page><page sequence="11">198 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of the epistemological picture outlined above. He maintains that In the view which places real value on the particulars of time and individuality, not only is the learner originally without knowledge, he is without the basic condition or ability to receive knowledge as well. Thus, unless someone (God Himself) supplies him with the condition (faith) whereby he can receive the truth, the learner will always remain without knowl- edge. To put it philosophically, the egocentric predicament will consign the learner to skepticism. Moreover, the teacher (God) must provide this condition by descending to the level of the learner, and not by insisting that the learner ascend to the level of the teacher. All of this renders the specific relationship between the learner and the teacher (the Moment, when knowledge is obtained) extremely significant and decisive. The idea that the mind of the knowing subject can ever transcend the egocentric predicament, and move from ignorance of reality to knowl- edge of it, presents itself as a paradox which can not be grasped by reason. Put theologically, the paradox is that God (as teacher) would descend to the level of the learner in order to provide him with the faith which enables him to know the truth.25 Either man has knowledge or he does not. If he has it, as in classical idealism, then all he needs is reminding. If he does not have it, as in New Testament Christianity, then it would seem illogical to conceive of his ever obtaining it because he would not recognize it when confronted with it. And yet, Christianity maintains that knowledge can be obtained. This is the "Absolute Para- dox" delineated in chapter three of the Fragments and summarized in chapter four: Unless the God grants the condition which makes it possible to understand this, how is it to be supposed that the learner will be able to discover it! But that the God himself gives this condition has been shown above to be a consequence of the Moment, and it has also been shown that the Moment is the Paradox, and that without it we are unable to advance, but return to Socrates.26 Kierkegaard maintains that reason must reject such a paradox as meaningless, for it is unable to grasp something that thought can not think. Although a good deal of ink has been used to distinguish between paradox and contradiction in order to protect Kierkegaard from being labelled an irrationalist, the opening pages of chapter three of the Frag- ments make it clear that Kierkegaard uses 'paradox' as a synonym for 'rational contradiction'. One simply cannot, according to Kierkegaard, 25 Ibid., p. 46. 26 Ibid., p. 72.</page><page sequence="12">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 199 expect pure, speculative reason to perform beyond its inherent limita- tions. By means of human reason there is no way to obtain knowledge of reality, nor to break out of the limitations of the egocentric predica- ment. The attempt to apply reason to ultimate reality only ends in contradiction.2 The parallels to Kant's views concerning the limitations and anti- nomies of speculative reason are obvious. Furthermore, Kierkegaard, like Kant, devotes a good deal of space to criticism of the traditional proofs of God's existence.28 He argues that deductive proofs are circular and irrelevant to questions of existence, while inductive arguments do not yield proof because the evidence is never all in. Thus, with Kant, Kierkegaard concludes that a strict, rational knowledge of reality, in- cluding God, is absolutely impossible. In the "Appendix" to chapter three, Kierkegaard asserts that the only way out of this skeptical situation (the way made possible by Christi- anity) is for reason to admit its limitations and set itself aside in order to make room for faith. Only an active, passionate faith can embrace and accept the paradox. This does not mean that the learner "under- stands" the paradox, but only that he, by reason, understands that it is a paradox, and accepts it as such by faith. Thus, it is only by means of a "leap" that the knower is able to transcend the egocentric predica- ment. He can not know how he has obtained knowledge, but he can know that he has obtained it. He can not understand it, but he can experience it. We do not ask that he understand the Paradox but only understand that this is the Paradox. How this takes place we have already shown. It comes to pass when the Reason and the Paradox encounter one another happily in the Moment, when the Reason sets itself aside and the Paradox bestows itself. The third entity in which this union is realized (for it is not realized in the Reason, since it is set aside: nor in the Paradox, which bestows itself - hence it is realized in something) is that happy passion to which we will now assign a name, though it is not the name that so much matters. We shall call this passion: Faith.29 Although Kierkegaard does not connect such faith directly with morality, as does Kant, he does connect it with the realm of feelings and exist- ential experience in a way which makes it similar to Kant's act of "postulating" God and immortality on the basis of the moral imperative. 27 Ibid., p. 59. 28 Ibid., pp. ff. and p. 118. 29 Ibid., p. 72.</page><page sequence="13">200 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH In chapters four and five, and in the Interlude between them, Kier- kegaard raises the question concerning the nature of religious faith. In the case of the disciple who was contemporaneous with the historical Christ (chapter four), it is clear that his faith was not dependent upon a knowledge of the historical circumstances concerning Jesus. Nor was it dependent upon the disciple's knowledge of Jesus' teachings. Both of these only served as "occasions for self-understanding." 30 Faith is not a form of knowledge at all, since "no knowledge can have for its object the absurdity that the Eternal is the historical." 31 In like fashion, faith is not an act of the will, since such an act presupposes the ability to grasp the truth - and man does not have this ability. In fact, faith itself is this ability (or condition) to grasp the truth, and it must be given by God. Faith is, then, neither knowledge nor an act, but a miraculous gift of God which enables the disciple to accept the paradox that "knowl- edge" of God (reality) is possible. I have put quotation marks around the term 'knowledge' because Kierkegaard uses it in an ambiguous manner. On the one hand, he appears to maintain that cognitive (propositional) knowledge of God is impossible, and on the other hand, he seems to maintain that experiental knowledge of God is possible. Space will not permit further discussion of this important point. Suffice it to say that for myself I do not think Kierkegaard is sufficiently clear in his use of the term 'knowledge'. At any rate, it is clear that he wants an "absolute, qualitative distinction" drawn between 'knowledge' in the scientific and/or philosophical sense and 'faith' in the religious sense. The same conclusions are said to hold for the disciple who was not contemporaneous with the historical Jesus. If faith were dependent upon the knowledge of historical facts, all "secondhand" disciples down through the ages would be at a decided disadvantage.- and, indeed, could not be said to have faith at all! 32 Thus it is that religious faith must be defined as completely independent of all forms of human knowledge. That God revealed Himself in history can be received by faith alone. The historical fact for a contemporary is that the God has come into exist- ence; for the member of a later generation the historical fact is that the God has been present through having come into existence. Herein precisely lies the contradiction. No one can become immediately contemporary with this historical fact, as has been shown ini the preceding; it is the object of Faith, 3O Ibid., p. 75. 31 Ibid., p. 76. 32 Ibid., p. 126.</page><page sequence="14">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 201 since it concerns coming into existence. No question is here raised as to the true content of this; the question is if one will give assent to the God's having come into existence, by which the God's eternal essence is inflected in the dialectical determination of coming into existence.33 In the final pages of the Fragments, Kierkegaard sets forth one of the most important implications of the above account of faith. It must be noted, in passing, that there is a definite sense in which this implication undercuts Kierkegaard's original distinction between classical idealism, in which the particular is irrelevant, and New Testament Christianity in which the particular is of decisive importance! Kierkegaard reasons that since faith is independent of any and all forms of knowledge about the historical Jesus, such knowledge only serves as an "occasion" (his term) for confronting the individual with the paradoxical claim that God has made Himself knowable to mankind. In the same way, the testi- mony of other believers only serves as a pointer to the ultimate reality which is to be accepted by faith. For this reason, the reliability of the particular witness is essentially unimportant. The following quotation clearly states Kierkegaard's rather perplexing point: If the fact spoken of were a simple historical fact, the accuracy of the his- torical sources would be of great importance. Here this is not the case, for Faith cannot be distilled from even the nicest accuracy of detail. The historical fact that the God has been in human form is the essence of the matter; the rest of the historical detail is not even as important as if we had to do with a human being instead of with the God. Jurists say that a capital crime submerges all lesser crimes, and so it is with Faith. Its absurdity makes all petty difficulties vanish. Inconsistencies which would otherwise be discon- certing do not count for anything here; they make no difference whatsoever. But it does make a difference on the contrary, if someone by petty calcu- lation should try to auction off faith to the highest bidder; it makes so much difference as to prevent him from ever becoming a believer. If the contem- porary generation had left nothing behind them but these words: 'We have believed that in such and such a year the God appeared among us in the humble figure of a servant, that he lived and taught in our community, and finally died,' it would be more than enough. The contemporary generation would have done all that was necessary; for this little advertisement, this nota bene on a page of universal history, would be sufficient to afford an occasion for a successor, and the most voluminous account can in all eternity do nothing more.34 Having laid out the philosophical skeleton of his position in the Fragments, Kierkegaard proceeded to "clothe" it with religious signifi- cance in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript.35 This work delineates 33 Ibid., p. 108. 34 Ibid., P. 130. 35 Kierkegaard S0ren. Concluding Unscientific Postscript (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1941), translated by David F. Swenson.</page><page sequence="15">202 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the dichotomy between objective knowledge and subjective faith even more forcefully than does the Fragments. In fact, the Postscript is divided into two books, the first of which is concerned with "the objective problem concerning the truth of Christianity," and the second of which is concerned with "the subjective problem concerning the truth of Christianity." Only the first book and the first part of the second book are integral to our present considerations. After stating the problem in terms of the possibility of basing one's eternal happiness upon a particular historical fact,36 Kierkegaard pro- ceeds to examine the relevance of historical knowledge to Christian faith. Although the attempt to establish the truth of Christianity on objective historical facts takes various forms - such as scriptural relia- bility, ecclesiastical authority and/or longevity - the results are always negative. The reason for this is not that the objective truth of such arguments cannot be established, but rather that even if it could be established, this would not have the slightest effect upon the status of one's faith. Nor would the inability to establish such arguments have any effect on faith. In fact, such concern with objective proof is a clear indication of the loss of faith! Here is the crux of the matter, and I come back to the case of the learned theology. For whose sake is it that the proof is sought? Faith does not need it; aye, it must even regard the proof as its enemy. But when faith begins to feel embarrassed and ashamed, like a young woman for whom her love is no longer sufficient, but who secretly feels ashamed of her lover and must therefore have it established that there is something remarkable about him - when faith thus begins to lose its passion, when faith begins to cease to be faith, then a proof becomes necessary so as to command respect from the side of unbelief. And as for the rhetorical stupidities that have been perpe- trated by clergymen in connection with this matter, through a confusion of the categories - alas, let us not speak of them.37 Note here the phrase "confusion of categories." Such concepts clearly point up the Kantian-like dichotomy which Kierkegaard posits between knowledge and faith. Next, Kierkegaard briefly examines the relevance of objective, specu- lative reason to Christian faith. Here, too, the conclusion is negative. Philosophical speculation is fine in its place, but one must never allow it to be confused with religious faith. "Christianity does not lend itself to objective observation, precisely because it proposes to intensify subjectivity to the utmost; and when the subject has thus put himself 36 Ibid., pp. 18-20 (introduction). 3 Ibid., p. 31.</page><page sequence="16">KANT, KIERKEGAARD, AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE 203 in the right attitude, he cannot attach his eternal happiness to speculative philosophy." 38 In part one of Book Two, Kierkegaard discusses the relation between knowledge and faith in connection with the philosophy of Lessing. First, Lessing was supposed to have maintained, and Kierkegaard expresses some doubt about his actual beliefs, that since there is an absolute distinction between eternal truth and factual knowledge, the former could never be dependent upon the latter.39 The eternal truth can only be known by a "leap" out of the realm of factual knowledge. Now, although Kierkegaard thinks that Lessing confuses the issue of con- temporaneity, he admires him for having seen the basic disjunction between these two realms. I refer to the fact that he religiously shut himself up within the isolation of his own subjectivity; that he did not permit himself to be deceived into be- coming world-historic and systematic with respect to the religious, but under- stood and knew how to hold fast to the understanding that the religious concerned Lessing, and Lessing alone, just as it concerns every other human being in the same manner; understood that he had infinitely to do with God, and nothing, nothing to do with any man directly.40 Second, Lessing also said that "if God held all truth in His right hand, and in His left hand held the lifelong pursuit of it, he would choose the left hand." 41 Kierkegaard takes this to be a distinction between the way of speculative, religious knowledge and existential, religious faith. He enters into a lengthy polemic against the concern for a "system" of thought in connection with Christianity. In addition, Kierkegaard uses this distinction as the springboard for his detailed explanation of the nature and quality of the subjective mode of existence which he presents in the remainder of the Postscript. Indeed, Lessing's distinction could be said to be the banner under which Kierkegaard's "knight of faith" does battle! The existing individual who concentrates all his attention upon the circum- stance that he is an existing individual, will welcome these words of Lessing about a persistent striving, as a beautiful saying. To be sure, it did not in- deed win for its author an immortal fame, because it is very simple; but every thoughtful individual must needs confirm its truth.42 38 Ibid., p. 55. 39 Ibid., pp. 86 ff. 40 Ibid., p. 61. 41 Ibid., pp. 97 ff. 42 Ibid., p. 109.</page><page sequence="17">204 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH By way of summary, it can be said that Kierkegaard distinguishes between reason and faith, not in order to call attention to two forms of knowledge, but in order to set faith, as an experience and a commit- ment, over against all forms of knowledge. He is not opting for subjec- tivity in matters of objective knowledge, but he is opting for subjectivity in matters of modes of existence. Nevertheless, he clearly maintains that such existential subjectivity - adequacy of life -is in no way dependent upon epistemological considerations. In Kierkegaard's approach, the realms of knowledge and faith are entirely separate. It should be noted that I have given him the benefit of the doubt in stating that he does not offer "subjective knowledge" as a substitute for objective knowledge in matters of religion. He is often interpreted in just this way, and there are certainly a number of passages wherein he seems to be doing just that. I take it that the interpretation I have given is the more plausible of the two. That this position is essentially Kantian should be fairly clear by now. The basic distinction between objectivity and subjectivity (knowledge and faith), the limitations of the former and the priority of the latter, and the association of religion with feelings and morality all suggest an epistemological pattern which is essentially parallel to that of Kant. Of course, this is not to suggest that there are no differences between the approaches of Kant and Kierkegaard. The most obvious difference is that in the face of the impossibility of religious knowledge, Kant merely "posits" the existence of God and immortality in a tentative fashion, while Kierkegaard "leaps" beyond and accepts the paradox that knowl- edge of God is nonetheless possible, in a decisive fashion. This is a difference in their responses to the epistemological situation, and not in their analysis of the nature of that situation. It could be maintained that both are inconsistent; Kant because he smuggles God in after exiling Him, and Kierkegaard because he actually takes back with one hand the decisive quality of the particular which he had offered with the other.
