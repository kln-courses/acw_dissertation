<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWENTIETH CENTURY ART THE MURIEL KALLIS STEINBERG NEWMAN COLLECTION: A PROMISED GIFT This year the Museum gratefully announces the major and prom- ised gift of sixty-seven modern paintings, sculptures, and works on paper from the Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman Collection. Mrs. Newman resides in Chicago and is an honorary trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The entire collection was recently on view in the Museum's exhibition An American Choice: The Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman Collection (May 21-September 27, 1981), which was organized by William S. Lieberman, chairman of the Department of Twentieth Century Art. As a collector, Muriel Newman is most recognized for her outstanding selection of works by artists of the New York School. During the heroic years of Abstract Expressionism, 1945 to 1955, she perceptively collected choice examples by these artists, years before their work found public acceptance. While the focus of the collection is on this period of American art, Mrs. Newman also acquired notable works by early European modernists Juan Gris, Fernand Leger, and Jacques Lipchitz and Surrealists Max Ernst, Jean Arp, and Joan Mir6. In addition, there are select pieces by American artists working in the 1960s, among them Claes Oldenburg, Paul Feeley, Kenneth Noland, and Morris Louis. Mrs. Newman's extraordinary gift significantly strengthens the Museum's collection of twentieth-century art. Many important artists previously missing from the department's holdings are now represented for the first time by prime examples. Sculptural addi- tions by Surrealist-influenced Alberto Giacometti, and by Ibram Lassaw, Theodore Roszak, and Richard Stankiewicz-three art- ists associated with the Abstract Expressionist group-all were done in the 1950s. Produced earlier in the century, Kurt Schwitters's complex collage Plan of Love (1923) and Joan Mir6's well-known painting The Circus Horse (1927) fill critical omissions in the collection's roster of European modernists. Several other pieces in the Newman gift supplement works already owned by the Museum, either by illuminating a different phase of the artist's work or by complementing our holdings from the same period. Leger's exquisite early cityscape of 1920, The Builders, is a prime example of his machine-age imagery and the first work by Leger of this period to be represented in the collec- tion. Four lyrical drawings created by Arshile Gorky between 1943 and 1947 relate closely in style to the Museum's beautiful painting Water of the Flowery Mill (1944). A pencil-and-crayon drawing of 1941 by Matta predates by one year the Museum's other new Matta acquisition announced in this publication. LMM JOAN MIRO Spanish. b. 1893 The Circus Horse. 1927 Tempera on canvas, 51 4 x 38/4 in. (130.2 x 97.2 cm.). Signed and dated (lower right): Mir6/1927. Promised Gift of Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman. SL.80.175.48 Although widely reproduced, Mir6's The Circus Horse was last exhibited in the artist's first retrospective, organized by the Museum of Modern Art in 1941. At that time it was in the collection of Chester Dale. The recent Newman Collection exhi- bition brought this masterwork once again into the public eye after a lapse of forty years. Mir6's canvas was painted three years after the artist officially became associated with the Surrealist group. Prior to his joining, Mir6's work had achieved a mature style resulting in fantastic, poetic visions of people, places, and objects familiar to him. Under the influence of the Surrealists, his art took a new direction: spontaneous, automatic pictographs derived from the artist's sub- conscious. A dozen circus pictures painted in 1927 were a coda to the over 100 fantasies he produced between 1925 and 1927. As exemplified by The Circus Horse, these pieces are more measured Entries by Lowery S. Sims, Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, Associate Curators; R.

The major narrative elements of the ringmaster, whip, and horse are more clearly stated in The Circus Horse than in other works of the series, many of which simplify the theme into purely calligraphic images. The ringmaster, whose white form is fixed at the center, commands the eye of the viewer and the attention of the rearing horse with the directional movement of his cracking whip. LMM WILLEM DE KOONING American. b. 1904 Attic. 1949 Oil, enamel, and newspaper transfer on canvas, 617/ x 81 in. (157.2 x 205.7 cm.). Promised Gift of Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman. SL.80.175.35 An Abstract Expressionist work of major importance in the Newman Collection is Willem de Kooning's magnificently realized painting of 1949, Attic, which has been widely reproduced and exhibited. It marks the culmination of the artist's complexly energetic black-and-white series of abstractions begun three years earlier, in 1946. The first canvases depicted very simplified, black biomorphic forms on a crowded white ground. In later works in the series, like Attic, this form-space relationship was reversed so that white forms were on a dark ground. In Attic the web of white shapes is so dense that the background space virtually disappears. Although severely restricted in color, Attic demon- strates de Kooning's virtuosity in his sensuous and expressive handling of paint, surface, and line. In the works that immediately followed Attic, de Kooning resumed his use of full color. LMM JACKSON POLLOCK American. 1912-56 Number 28, 1950. 1950 Enamel on canvas, 68/4 x 105 in. (173.4 x 266.7 cm.). Promised Gift of Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman. SL.80.56 Probably the single most important work of the Newman promised gift is Jackson Pollock's dazzling silver painting, Number 28, 1950. It was painted the same year as Autumn Rhythm, the exquisite Pollock already in the Museum's collection. Although both were created by the same innovative drip technique, developed by the artist in 1947, they differ greatly in size, color, and composition. Together they demonstrate the extraordinary breadth of Pollock's expression and creativity. Autumn Rhythm is characteristically large, stretching almost sixteen feet long, and as the title suggests, is autumnal in coloring, utilizing mainly rusts, browns, and black. Though expansive in scale, the composition seems self-contained within the edges of the canvas, its energy visually harnessed. Number 28, 1950, on the other hand, conveys a different vision. By comparison, it is small in size, though still a large painting, measuring almost six by nine feet. The tonalities are cooler- mainly silver, gray, black, and white-emphasizing the metallic qualities of the paint. Most notably, the dynamic composition seems to push beyond the limits of the canvas: a lyrical vision of expansive space. LMM 62</page><page sequence="3">MARK ROTHKO American. 1903-70 Number One. 1953 Oil on canvas, 68 x 54 in. (172.7 x 137.2 cm.). Signed and dated on reverse: Mark Rothko/1953. Promised Gift of Muriel Kallis Steinberg Newman. SL.80.175.62 Although associated with the Abstract Expressionists, Rothko did not share either their enthusiasm for uninhibited self-expression or their exploitation of the physical, sensual aspects of oil paint. He preferred, instead, to create rigidly formulated, spiritual composi- tions that minimized the textural nature of the oil medium. By 1950 Rothko had developed a mature style of painting, which GUSTAV GAUDERNACK Norwegian. 1865-1914 Cup. 1901 Enamel and silver gilt, 8'/8 in. (20.5 cm.). Made by DAVID ANDERSEN, Oslo. Purchase, Friends of Twentieth Century Decorative Arts Gifts. 1981.78 The almost forgotten Norwegian expression of Art Nouveau that once won international acclaim is exemplified in a fragile flower- form enameled cup. It is a bravura example of the plique-a-jour enameling technique. While the base of the cup shimmers with he refined and simplified during the next twenty years of his life. The compositions that followed were devoid of representational imagery and adhered to a strictly defined structure: two or three horizontal bands of color hovered on the canvas field, producing spatially flattened, frontal compositions. Light seemed to emanate from the translucent bands, which were created by staining the canvas fibers with pigment. The artist sought to engage the viewer in an intimate relationship with the picture by surrounding him with a large canvas. Number One, painted in 1953, is an early representation of Rothko's style and will join a later example of the artist's work, Reds No. 16 (1960), already in the Museum's collection. LMM green enamel applied to a silver-gilt base, the bowl and the freestanding lavender narcissus that flank it are made of the thinnest film of translucent enamel stretched between filigree wires. The piece bears the mark of the noted silversmithing firm of David Andersen, established in Oslo in 1876. The designer is Gustav Gaudernack, who studied in Austria and in 1892 joined David Andersen, where his designs developed from those in a historicizing Norse manner to those in a full-bodied Art Nouveau 63</page><page sequence="4">style. Outstanding among his works are approximately a dozen vessels of openwork plique-a-jour enamel. The drawing for this flower-cup signed by Gaudernack and dated 1901 is illustrated in the catalogue of the exhibition Gustav Gaudernack at the Kunst- industrimuseet i Oslo (Oslo, 1979, no. 81). It was showpieces such as this that won gold medals for Gaudernack and David Andersen at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900 and the Grand Prix at the Saint Louis Exhibition of 1904. PH-S ANDRE DERAIN French. 1880-1954 Still Life. 1913 Oil on canvas, 36 x 231/2 in. (91.4 x 59.7 cm.). Signed lower right: Derain. Gift of Mala Rubinstein Silson. 1980.601 Shortly after the turn of the century, in the early years of Derain's career, he was considered a leading member of the Fauves, a group of painters who applied expressive, bold colors in staccato, flat patterns in an effort to free their pictures from the restraints of conventional imitative rendering. By 1906 Derain's landscapes began to return to form and structure, or, as Guillaume Apollinaire called it, "sobriety and balance." That year Derain met Picasso, and by 1908 he was frequently in the company of the artists and writers of the Cubist circle. Although sympathetic to Cubism, Derain's own work never displayed the same extreme of disintegrated form. His paintings were more closely allied with those of Cezanne in their emphasis on construction and solidity. A series of still lifes done a few years before the outbreak of World War I shows Derain's bold, monumental style at its height. Somber-often monochromatic- palettes, stark compositions, and daring perspectives characterize these works. Derain's 1913 painting of domestic items arranged on a table is the third and latest still life of this period to join the Museum's already considerable holdings of the artist's work. Its companion pieces are from the two preceding years: The Table (1911) and Pitcher and Dishes (1912). The artist is additionally represented in the collection by a fascinating early Fauve portrait, Lucien Gilbert (1905). Our new acquisition exemplifies Derain's interest in the artistic possibilities of still-life motifs, subjects much favored by the Cubists. Another, less simplified version of our painting, which is illustrated in a 1920 article by the artist's dealer at that time, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, helps identify the items on the cloth- draped, brick-red table of our piece: a tall jug, handle obscured, stands in the rear, next to a woven basket filled with bread, while in front, an empty plate lies beside a fluted bowl.

Purchase, Mr. and Mrs. Milton Petrie Gift. 1981.197 In his artistically formative years Duncan Grant was a member of the Bloomsbury circle, along with Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf. This group, formed in the first decades of the century, consisted of highly talented individuals tied together by heredity and family connections. They refused to accept any standard- intellectual, artistic, or moral-unless it met with the approval of their own unaided judgment. Duncan Grant, born in Scotland in 1885, spent most of his life as an expatriate. After a childhood in India he returned to England to study at the Westminster School of Art in 1902. Like other artists of his time, he did not think he profited from art school and left to study abroad. He studied the old masters in Paris and Italy and the great Impressionists in Luxembourg at the Caillebotte Collection. Upon his return to London he entered the Slade School but quit after a term. His early works, despite a relatively sparse academic background, show an exceptional natural talent. His style, with its discreet realism, was almost too modest to leave its mark on the world. The years between 1913 and 1919, during which he worked with a number of other young artists at the Omega Workshop in London, formed an important period in his life. Manufacturing and decorating a great variety of household objects-furniture, pottery, and textiles-he showed a great ability, and according to Roger Fry, "his fellow artists recognized the peculiar charm, the 64</page><page sequence="5">A____T=:== unexpected originality, and the rare distinction of his ideas." His aptitude for devising new and seductive harmonies of color and for discovering decorative motifs in the most unlikely places was given full rein. Grant's versatility grew out of the variety of possibilities that were opening up to British artists in the period before World War I. Vorticism, a variety of Cubism and Futurism found exclusively in England, was becoming popular; artists working in this manner were making the most radical and sustained innovations. Works by Matisse attracted and affected Grant, who was naturally sensi- tive to color. Some of Grant's other paintings reflect the impact of Picasso and African sculpture. Influenced also by the Fauves and Cubists, he used their discoveries and conventions with a light hand. His color was captivating and his style fluent and graceful. In his work the most banal objects might be endowed with the charm of a decorative motif without being deprived of subtleties of form and color belonging to pictorial rather than decorative design. Like Chardin, whom he admired, he took his themes from his immediate and everyday surroundings and imbued them with grace and refinement. The Coffee Pot is one of the first pieces by an English artist in the early cubist tradition to enter the Museum's collection. The broad handling of forms and predominately angular rather than curved shapes show the Cubist influence. The pot, with its strong stripes of color and black handle, indicates the sensitive richness of color that was so natural to Grant. Duncan Grant's art has escaped classification. Although critics have labeled every new phase of painting in this period, this artist's work is strongly marked by a style of its own that is recognizable at first sight and defies categorization. EN SAMUEL HALPERT American. 1884-1930 Flatiron Building (Madison Park). 1919 Oil on canvas, 40 x 34 in. (101.6 x 86.4 cm.). Signed and dated lower left: S. Halpert, 1919. Gift of Dr. and Mrs. Wesley Halpert. 1981.36 Samuel Halpert was among the earliest of that generation of American artists (including Karfiol, Weber, Walkowitz, Demuth, Russell, Benton, Dove, Sheeler, Stella, and Hartley) who in the early part of the century sojourned in Europe-especially Paris, where Post-Impressionism was still making its imprint and Fauvism was the new movement. Halpert was born in Russia and came to the United States when he was five years old. Although he rejected formal instruction and preferred to observe the modern masters for himself-Cezanne, Matisse, and Albert Marquet were major influences-Halpert did, however, briefly study, between 1899 and 1902, at the National Academy of Design in New York and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While in Paris, he exhibited at the Salons from 1903 on, and in 1911 became a member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1912 he returned to America but still made several intermittent trips to Europe. In the New York Armory Show of 1913, Halpert exhibited two paintings. His first one-man show was held in 1914 at the Charles Daniel Gallery. During his short lifetime, the artist's career was somewhat overshadowed by that of his wife, Edith Gregor Halpert, who ran the successful Downtown Gallery (established in 1926), where Halpert's Ameri- can contemporaries were well represented. The artist continued to have annual shows at the New York galleries, and his first retro- spective exhibition was mounted in 1927 at the Detroit Institute of Arts. After the show, Halpert remained in Detroit, where he taught until his death only three years later, in 1930. It was not until 1969 that the artist's work was once again exhibited on a large scale in a well-received retrospective at the Bernard Black Gallery. Flatiron Building (Madison Park) is a stunning painting, with its semiaerial viewpoint, its hazy, blue light pervading the buildings, and its shadowy outlines of the streets, which are interrupted by patches of sunlight. Madison Park, in the lower center of the painting, provides a compositional break from the large rectangles of architecture lining Fifth Avenue and Broadway, the transient crowds on the sidewalks, and the rows of parked boxcars. Halpert's pervading light is almost a precursor of Hopper's. In this work, his impressionism has matured into a personal style. What Henry Geldzahler has observed about Notre Dame, Paris (1925), another painting by the artist, which has been in the collection since 1938, can also be said of Flatiron Building: "Halpert's work, pleasantly observed and expertly crafted, can be thought of as the painting of a classicizing modernist" (American Painting in the Twentieth Century, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1965, pp. 82-83). IB 65</page><page sequence="6">GEORGIA O'KEEFFE American. b. 1887 A Storm. 1921 Pastel on paper, 18/4 x 2438 in. (46.4 x 61.9 cm.). Purchase, Anonymous Gift. 1981.35 The early work of Georgia O'Keeffe, a leading figure in American modernism, is already represented in the Museum's collection by twelve oil paintings and three works on paper. A Storm, however, is the first pastel by the artist to be acquired. It displays O'Keeffe's mastery of a medium not readily associated with her work (she is probably best known today for her close-up paintings of floral subjects, such as Black Iris in our collection), although one to which she has returned for brief interludes over the last sixty years. O'Keeffe's pastels were shown often during the 1920s and 1930s in exhibitions organized by her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, the great champion of American modern art. Even as late as 1952 the Downtown Gallery in New York held an exhibition composed solely of her pastels from 1915-45. For the past thirty years, however, this facet of her oeuvre has received little attention. The Museum's recent acquisition adds a new dimension to our under- standing of the artist's sensitive and original handling of materials and motifs. O'Keeffe's subjects seem to be drawn from two ex- tremes of vision: oversized, seemingly abstracted, and often frag- mented images of common objects (such as plants, shells, and bones) and expressively rendered vistas of the American landscape. Whether closely focused or panoramic, her work is always autobio- graphical. A Storm is one of two pastels (the other is in the Lane Founda- tion Collection, Leominster, Massachusetts) that capture the awesome sight of a raging electrical storm over water. Both were probably drawn at Lake George, in upstate New York, where, during the early 1920s, O'Keeffe and Stieglitz spent long summers that stretched from April to late fall. Although the compositions of the two storm pictures are very similar, significant differences suggest that our new acquisition probably precedes the other in date. O'Keeffe often does several works based on a single motif, and in most cases develops the image from a naturalistic treatment to an abstract one. In this instance, our storm picture seems to be a more faithful, naturalistic rendering of the incident, even to the 66 inclusion of the full moon reflected in the dark water. In general, the Lake George pictures tend to be somber in mood, relatively naturalistic in style, and focused on the strong, rhythmic lines present in the depicted landscape. A Storm exemplifies these qualities and illustrates O'Keeffe's mastery of the expressive use of color. A striking effect is achieved through her expert manipulation of color, medium, and subject matter. O'Keeffe creates a jolting contrast between the deep blue pastel of the sky and water, smudged and velvety, and the sharp, angular bolt of red lightning (shown as it strikes the water), accented by a pale line of yellow. After seeing the two storm pastels in a 1934 exhibition, a critic was moved to write about O'Keeffe's "thrilling imprisonment of the sky's wild splendor" (Edward Alden Jewell, "Georgia O'Keeffe in an Art Review," New York Times, Feb. 2, 1934, p. 15).

LMM CHARLES BIEDERMAN American. b. 1906 Number 18. 1938 Painted wood and plastic, 31 x 21 1/2X 4 in. (78.7 x 54.6 x 10.2 cm.). Signed and.dated on reverse: Charles Biederman 1938. Arthur Hoppock Hearn Fund. 1980.419 In the early years of his career, Charles Biederman experimented with Cezanne's concepts, Post-Impressionism, Cubism, and fi- nally, total abstraction. In 1934, he left the Midwest for New York and remained there until 1940, except for a trip to Paris in 1936. He was exposed to other influential modern masters-namely, Leger, Mir6, and Mondrian-in New York and was given his first one-man show at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in 1936. At that time, Biederman exhibited a number of paintings showing Mir6's in- fluence in the depictions of brightly colored, biomorphic forms. While the majority of these works had organic shapes, there were also geometric elements present. In October of 1936, he made his first trip to Paris and met the artists whom he admired-Mondrian, Arp, Brancusi, Mir6, Van- tongerloo, and Leger. Biederman was disappointed that he had not been in Paris earlier, before the experimental and creative</page><page sequence="7">energy of the modern movement had achieved its goal. By the he left for New York in the summer of 1937, he had air distilled quite a few of his ideas. He was most impressed by a to Pevsner, whose Constructivist ideas prevailed in Biedern work and thought for some time. Indeed, just before he left F only two movements interested him, both of which exert profound influence on his career: Constructivism and de Stijl. By 1937, his paintings had become quite sculptural, witi forms suspended in space. This was to be Biederman's last p of painting: thereafter, he felt that his artistic search in dimensions had ended and his ideas could now only be render three-dimensional forms. Biederman had been moving tou abstraction since 1934, and in 1935 he began experimenting M series of wood panels with geometric designs painted in pril colors. The panels would later emerge as "reliefs" with an &lt; nized compositional format similar to that of paintings by 1 drian, whose writings and works Biederman studied extensi These constructions could be seen from various angles, and na light and cast shadows enhanced and varied the effect. In initial experimental period, the linear right angle became a d nant motif, and his last studies in Paris stressed this theme. Nu 18 belongs to a series of these wall constructions that was exec in two or three primary colors against a white background. Ii case, the dominating white background panel is hollowed o the center to form a number of tangential right angles, anc color, yellow, has been added, in the form of a translucent pi sheet. Number 18 is important because it bridges Biedern experimental period and the mature style of his reliefs of the 1940s, in which a grid of individual, brilliantly colored elen floats freely against a painted background panel. Numbe effectively combines the rigid geometry and primary colors c acteristic of de Stijl with the translucent surfaces that preocci Constructivist sculptors such as Pevsner and Gabo. While still in New York, Biederman encountered a hostil world that rejected his new concepts of art and left him quite isolated for almost twenty-five years. In 1942, he settled in Red Wing, Minnesota, where he worked, taught, and extensively wrote about his art theories. It was not until 1965-when the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis had a Biederman retrospective with more than 150 works, which in 1969 was exhibited in London-that the artist once again became part of the international art scene.

Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Meyer Schapiro. 1980.575.1 As a young man arriving in Paris in 1933, Matta studied architec- ture and later worked for the architect Le Corbusier. In 1937, however, at the age of twenty-five, he gave up this career to become an artist. That year Matta produced his first drawings and through contact with the artist Salvador Dali became an official member of the Surrealist group. Along with fellow artists Victor Brauner, Oscar Dominguez, and Wolfgang Paalen, Matta belonged to the second Surrealist generation, until 1947. In 1938 he produced his first canvases, which initiated a long sequence that he called "psychological morphologies" or "inscapes." As the artist's terms indicate, these paintings sought to create pictorial metaphors for subconscious psychological experiences by means of fantastic landscape imagery. The resulting works were fluid compositions, vaguely defined by biomorphic shapes floating in an uncertain space. At the beginning of World War II, Matta, along with several other European Surrealists, emigrated to New York, where their art exerted a major impact on the nascent avant-garde artists later time known as the Abstract Expressionists. In particular, Matta's ready unique Surrealist vocabulary influenced the work of Arshile visit Gorky. It was also in New York, at the Julien Levy Gallery, that nan's Matta held his first one-man exhibition in 1940. Paris, Matta's numerous drawings from this period often relate tan- ted a gentially to his paintings-not as preliminary studies, but as independent visual expressions. The human figures that dominate h the his drawings are barely evident in the abstracted forms of the )hase paintings. two This untitled drawing of 1942 is one of two works on paper by -ed in vards vith a mary orga- .

The drawing utilizes Matta's characteristic graphic iconography: skeletal human figures menaced by raging flames float haphazardly through an infinite space of transparent planar forms and elusive spirals. Its composition anticipated by two years Matta's renunciation of the horizon line in. favor of something suggesting outer space, in such 1944 paintings as To Escape the Absolute (Slifka Collection, New York) and The Vertigo of Eros (Museum of Modern Art).

Gamble, Jr. Gift, in honor of his mother, Mrs. Theodore Robert Gamble. 1980.287 With the close of World War II, America moved into the forefront of the modern design movement. Eero Saarinen was one of the most gifted leaders of this group, and his "pedestal" or "tulip" chair remains one of the most acclaimed designs of the 1950s. From a technological standpoint, the armchair is a continuation of Saarinen's experiments from the 1940s with three-dimensional shell forms; but in this instance he has used colored plastic rather than molded plywood. Visually, the armchair expresses Saarinen's desire "to make the chair all one thing again," or to create a sculptural-shell chair of one piece and of one material. This was not technically feasible, however; and the base could only be achieved in cast aluminum with a fused plastic finish to match the upper plastic shell. Saarinen's armchair, nevertheless, remains an undisputed masterpiece by one of the twentieth century's greatest form-makers. RCM PABLO PICASSO Spanish. 1881-1973 Lady with a Flowered Hat. 1964 Printed ceramic, 2358 x 195/ x 1 in. (60 x 50 x 2.5 cm.). The Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kramer Collection, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kramer. 1980.481.2 This is one of eight clay plaques donated by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kramer that demonstrate the astonishing range and originality of Picasso's graphic work. The limited edition was executed in the Madourna pottery workshop of Georges and Suzanne Ramie in Vallouris. The novel process derives from printmaking rather than traditional ceramic techniques. Georges Bloch, who suggested the project to Picasso, recorded the artist's excitement at the challenge of the variant material: "If I engrave your thigh, that's engraving too!" (see bibliography). For the printing of his ceramics, a practice begun in 1949, Picasso carved, gouged, and engraved a plaster block. A slab of damp clay was laid on the block, tamped down, and dried in the sun. The clay, having assumed the contours of the block, was then removed and fired in a kiln. The relationship of the clay plaques to prints on paper is particularly close in the Metropolitan's examples. The original images were cut by Picasso in linoleum blocks, from which impres- sions on paper were first pulled. A plaster mold was subsequently taken of the linoleum to serve as a block for the ceramic edition. The Museum has counterparts for all eight plaques among the 140 Picasso linocuts donated by Mr. and Mrs. Kramer last year. A comparison of Lady with a Flowered Hat in linocut and ceramic reveals the different effects obtainable from the same image by the alternate techniques. The image on paper is slightly larger, the ceramic having shrunk in firing about one-eighth inch for every two inches in length or width. The images are reversed: the ceramic corresponds to the original linoleum block. The color values are remarkably similar: the ocher, rolled on the face of the linoleum block and printed before the cutting of the image began, has the same tone as the peach clay. The black applied to the 68</page><page sequence="9">ceramic appears to have been rolled on in the manner of printing. While the linocut is bolder, this ceramic is more animated. The gouging process that resulted in the flat image on paper is revealed in the relief of the clay. Even the texture of the canvas backing bared by deep cutting of the linoleum is reproduced. The effect is further dramatized, because the ridges of each gouge have been picked up by the ink rolled over the plaque. BIBLIOGRAPHY: Bloch, Georges.

LSS TONY SMITH American. 1912-80 Untitled. 1970 Black marble, 53/4 in. (14.6 cm.), diam. 12 in. (30.5 cm.). Gift of Henry Geldzahler. 1980.569 With the recent death of the sculptor Tony Smith, the New York art world was deprived of one of its more elegant and generative spirits. Smith first studied at the Art Students League in New York with George Bridgeman, George Grosz, and Vaclav Vytlacil. He later trained as an architect under Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago (1937-38) and then spent a year (1938- 39) working on Frank Lloyd Wright's Ardmore Experiment before going on to pursue his career. He turned to sculpture when he was in his late forties. His earliest sculptural studies during the 1930s included explorations of bas-reliefs and three-dimensional struc- tures that were influenced by the work of the Belgian Constructivist Georges Vantongerloo. This experience, along with his extensive involvement in architectural work, has informed the look of his sculpture. Critical evaluations of Smith's work have attributed to it a sensibility akin to that of Minimalist artists of the 1960s, who, in the words of Rosalind Krauss, "[refuse] to transform the common- place" and "[draw their subjects] from the inventory of very ordinary stuffs: plywood panels, fluorescent tubes, firebricks, rope, and industrial felt" (Passages in Modern Sculpture, New York, 1977, p. 198). Whereas these artists describe the identity and use of a sculptural form in a fundamental, essential, and nonevocative way, Smith always maintained that his work made reference to a context of things and attitudes. In many ways he had more in common with the sensibilities of the Abstract Expressionists, whom he had supported early on, during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Martin Friedman has written that his monumental forms allude to antique architectural forms and refer to "remembered elemental images" rendered in black, "dense and mysterious." Untitled is the first sculpture by Smith to enter the Metropolitan's collection. Although he produced some of his most compelling images on a large format, utilizing a single cubical or rectangular shape that defines itself variously in two or three directional thrusts, this sculpture, with its more personal scale and free- flowing circular movement, demonstrates Smith's ability to achieve a comparable grandeur of vision with smaller physical CY TWOMBLY American. b. 1928 Untitled. 1970 Crayon and acrylic on paper, 271/2 x 333/ in. (69.7 x 84.6 cm.). Signed and dated on reverse: Cy Twombly/Mar. 1970. Gift of Walter Bareiss in honor of Thomas B. Hess. 1980.315 For Cy Twombly painting is a special kind of calligraphy. He evolved a type of handwriting or "blackboard scribblings," of which Untitled is an example, over a fifteen-year period starting in the 1950s. Born and raised in Virginia, Twombly has lived in Rome for the past twenty-two years. As a student at the Art Students League during the 1940s and 1950s Twombly found a source for this system of signs. The pictographs of artists such as Adolph Gottlieb in the 1940s suggested the gridlike format that character- ized Twombly's deliberately unintelligible scribblings. During this period, when Abstract Expressionism was emerging as a leading modern style, Twombly also encountered the black-and-white works of artists such as Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. These works resembled the flourishes of oriental sumi brush writing but ultimately found their source in the automatic doodlings and writings cultivated by the Surrealists. In the work of an artist such as Willem de Kooning this "handwriting" manifested itself as broad, gestural strokes, in Jackson Pollock's work as overlapping linear elements flung on the canvas, and in Twombly's as markings whose taut and deliberate quality implies a specific narrative content. This drawn line unfolds in space, surging across the gray surface like the compulsive repetitions of a penmanship exercise. The pictorial space is thus created through the maze of line-much like Pollock's webbing-and at times the line fluctuates in density or spareness or expands in energy and freedom, suggesting a progression over time. Although Twombly's most recent work has assumed a more Tachist touch and has begun to include color, collage elements, and vestiges of drawn figures, this drawing, done in 1970, reflects his earlier and perhaps strongest work.

Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Fund, Inc. Gift, Arthur Hoppock Hearn Fund, Stephen C. Swid, The Bernhill Fund, Walter Bareiss and Louise Smith Gifts. 1980.420 Since the early sixties Roy Lichtenstein has borrowed blown-up sections from romantic serials and war sagas and recycled familiar subjects and themes-such as golf balls and household products in the process of being demonstrated-through the cool mechano- referential style derived from the benday dots of comic strips. Lichtenstein has similarly simplified icons from great masterpieces in art history, providing an ironic twist to his mechanical, pristine rendering. For years critics have remarked on the influence of Fernand Leger on Lichtenstein, pointing to the former's machine aesthetics, and he himself has acknowledged an aesthetic affinity with Piet Mondrian. But while Lichtenstein has long utilized the restrictive palette of Mondrian-the three primary colors and black and white-it is only recently that Lichtenstein has incorporated ref- erences to Leger's work into his own. Stepping Out, executed in 1978, depicts a young man in a straw hat, high-collared shirt, and striped tie, with a flower in his lapel. The man relates to the left- hand figure in Leger's 1944 composition Three Musicians (Museum of Modern Art). Lichtenstein reverses the original image and borrows a boutonniere from another, and what is interesting in this painting is the peculiar combination Lichtenstein effected in the composition. Whereas most of his borrowing tends to be truer to the original, in Stepping Out Lichtenstein provides the dapper young man with a rather disjointed female companion. Her facial characteristics have been reduced to one eye set on its side, from which a long lock of blond hair shoots up before cascading down. Her mouth is offset spatially on a plate with mitered edges. She 70 wears a high-necked jacket and a scarf. With this combination of two companions from different eras (indicated by their dress), Lichtenstein introduces into the composition a provocative note. Although the figural style of the woman relates to Lichtenstein's own version of the strongly contoured, flat, comic-strip female types, the dislocation of elements is surrealist in spirit and calls to mind the early work of Rene Magritte during the late twenties and that of Picasso during the thirties, particularly his Bather Playing Ball of 1932 (Museum of Modern Art). The Department of Twentieth Century Art purchased the sketch for this painting in 1978 with monies from a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Like all Lichtenstein's sketches it is relatively small in scale (12/2 x 63/4 inches). The artist projects such a sketch onto the canvas on a larger scale with an opaque projector and refines the composition to the point of its essential and most immediate impact. Although Stepping Out represents a continuation of Lichtenstein's preoccupation with ready-made imagery, this painting is also a late-baroque manifes- tation of the fresh and brash Pop sensibility of the 1960s.

(350.5 cm.), base 7 ft. (213.4 cm.). Signed and dated on base: 79 I. Noguchi. Gift of The Isamu Noguchi Foundation, Inc. 1980.131 For the last twelve years Isamu Noguchi has maintained a studio on the island of Shikoku in Japan. Unidentified Object was carved there and transported to New York, where it was first exhibited in 1980 at the entrance to Central Park at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street under the auspices of the Public Art Fund, Inc. Its subse- quent donation to the Museum by the Isamu Noguchi Foundation, Inc., signifies a concern on the part of the artist, the Museum, and other public art agencies that sculpture continue to thrive in New York City. Unidentified Object is the fourth sculptural work by Noguchi to enter the Museum's collection. In many ways it manifests the quintessential aspects of the artist's style, which matured during the 1950s and continues to find an ever greater refinement of expression. Sam Hunter has observed that the group of basalt works Noguchi has produced over the last few years are "all potent throwbacks to the ancient stone rune. They show respect for a romantic and untamed nature, and convey his desire to mine a personal atavism from images of primeval forms. Their massive architectural character is reminiscent of Stonehenge, but he modi- fies his primitivism by the revelation of subtly modeled interior cavities" (see ref., pp. 174-75). Born in Los Angeles in 1904 to a Japanese father and an American mother, Noguchi spent his childhood in Japan. He was sent back to the United States for further education at the age of thirteen. Although the peculiar aspects of Noguchi's style have often been attributed to his oriental heritage, it was his contact with the Rumanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi that allowed his sense of abstract form, informed by an awareness of tool and texture, to emerge. Noguchi went to Paris in 1927 on one of the first Guggenheim fellowships ever awarded, after having studied with the academic sculptor Onorio Ruotolo. Throughout his career, Noguchi has often remarked on the impact of Brancusi's sculpture on his work. Even the portraits that he produced to support himself when he returned from this first trip to Paris reveal that influence. In the likenesses of Angna Enters and Lillian Gish, both in our collection, the portrait image seems literally to emerge from the stone, with elements like the hair left either roughhewn or summarily worked-making felt the presence of the original stone and of the tool that has wrought the form.</page><page sequence="11">Noguchi refined his abstract sensibilities during the 1940s. The bonelike forms of Kouros, in our collection, and those shown in a small work sheet for a sculpture, purchased in 1978, show Noguchi's absorption of the biomorphic vocabulary of Joan Mir6, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Arp, and even more pertinently, the affinities in his work to the painter Yves Tanguy's nonspecific evocations of landscape. The peculiar environmental presence of Unidentified Object reflects Noguchi's longstanding concern with the social and public aspects of art. A brief involvement with monumental figural forms during the 1930s (for example the relief murals for the Associated Press Building in New York) demonstrates his interest in social commentary, which, in the words of Wayne Anderson, was "a prelude to [Noguchi's] involvement in the struggles of the war, for as a Japanese-American, he was a vulnerable participant" (see ref., p. 44). During his internment in a Nisei camp in 1942, Noguchi occupied himself designing a park and recreation area. He has continued to work on such environmental projects, producing numerous parks, fountains, and stage sets since the 1940s. These experiences allowed him to develop an acute sense of the relation- ship between scale and location, which permeates all of his sculp- ture-whether monumental or intimate in scale. Since the 1950s Noguchi's sculpture has explored a range of visual statements. An extended residence in Japan allowed him to investigate ancient forms and techniques and to discover his own approach to his heritage. Noguchi has worked in metals as well as stone, exploiting their peculiar qualities. By juxtaposing smooth, mechanic, precise, reflective metal with rough, organic stone or by combining the color and veinage of two or more stones in a single piece, Noguchi has achieved a range of sculptural statement that is unparalleled in "its diversity and boldness of invention" (Hunter, p. 190).

LSS JOAN WITEK American. b. 1943 Split. 1980 Oil on canvas, 68 x 68 in. (172.7 x 172.7 cm.). Signed and dated on reverse: Joan Witek 8/80 "Split." Edith Blum Fund. 1980.459.1 Split, by Joan Witek, a New York artist in her late thirties, was acquired by the Museum with monies from a fund established by Edith C. Blum to enable the Metropolitan to acquire paintings by living artists who have demonstrated their potential but have not come to the general attention of scholars and critics. An artist in her own right, Ms. Blum (1895-1976) is represented in the collec- tion by her painting Lost Lady (1938). Split represents a critical junction in Witek's stylistic evolution. She has worked exclusively in black since 1974, using squares or expanded cruciforms. Until very recently, Witek's canvases were left unstretched, as she sought to provide a contrast between the severe, mathematical rigidity of the compositions and the more informal statement of an unstructured canvas. About two years ago, Witek introduced strokes into her work. This development was inspired by preparatory drawings for paintings she had done on graph paper, utilizing strokes of ink to delineate areas that would be black. The strokes vary in size and width but conform to a horizontal grid much like the ink strokes of the drawings. The areas of canvas left blank by this stroking create their own dynamic visual pattern, which provides an alternative means of access to the composition, in addition to the pattern of the strokes them- selves. The artist is aware of the expressive potential of the gestural strokes. To counterbalance this effect, she has begun to stretch her canvases again to provide a more formal area for these gestures. Witek has expressed a liking for the "primitive" quality of these paintings. One can conjure up associations with resist-dyed fabric of West Africa, in which the visual tension between the blackish brown earth-dyed areas and the beige cloth is similar to that in Witek's work. This comparison is all the more tantalizing in view of Witek's past curatorial work with the art of Pre-Columbian America and Africa. Witek asserts that even after all this time, she finds working in black a very rich mode for her purposes. Indeed, even within this restricted palette, she is able to achieve great depth and passion that are not ordinarily associated with the color black. LSS 71</page></plain_text>
