<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comment: Veblen and the Mall of America When it's crowded, you drive up the levels of the parking ramp, from California to Hawaii to Arizona, and on to Nevada and Colorado. At the entrance to each level is posted a corresponding symbol: sunglasses for California, pineapple for Hawaii, cactus for Arizona, dice for Nevada, mountains for Colorado. In reality, we have none of these. No endless summer, no tropical sweetness, no desert, no roulette wheels, no cloudy peaks. It is December in Bloomington, Minnesota. The sky is a quilted grey mass and the world is flat, white and frozen to the horizon. But the nation's largest shopping mall, which calls itself the Mall of America, offers refuge from the numbing winter. The ramp has no level named for Nebraska or New Jersey; the associations are all wrong. Neither has it a Minnesota?for Minnesota surrounds us and we have enough of reality. Today, I find a space in Arizona, where the red-nosed attendant flaps his arms against the cold, and head into the heated walkway. It is three weeks before Christmas. Along with 100,000 other people this day and more than four million since it opened, I am here to see the latest and by far the biggest in American emporiums. Bars, amuse? ment rides and 14 movie theaters share a vast roof with 370 stores. We locals recognize the primacy of scale and call it simply the Megamall. In essential ways, every shopping mall is the same. They are cargo ships on seas of angled parking, beckoning us to come, look, eat, buy. The Megamall is not a ship but an armada. No one can walk there, buffered as it is by asphalt and freeways. It is built on the scale of airports and stadiums, intended to have a relationship with the crowd, not the individual. The titanic mall may be peculiar to this time of endless diversions and few answers for the things that most worry us?rising crime, insecure jobs, a fickle economy. But every age produces its own excess. Nearly a century ago, economist Thorstein Veblen com? plained about Americans who cared too much for status and too little for "the collective life." In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen coined the terms conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste. He had no trouble finding plenty of both. As it happens, Veblen grew up as the son of industrious Norwegian immigrants on a farm about an hour's drive south of the Megamall. After decades of neglect, the home and barn built by Veblen's father</page><page sequence="2">184 THE HUDSON REVIEW are being restored. To Veblen's admirers, the sturdy Greek revival house embodies the values he most respected?altruism ("the paren? tal bent"), craftsmanship ("workmanship") and critical intelligence ("idle curiosity"). He decried more "predatory" values?pecuniary gain and a form of winning through intimidation which he called "sportsmanship" because of the brute force and affectation he found in many sports. Definitely not a sports bar or shop-until-you-drop kind of guy. With his clarity of values, he'll be a good counterpoint to my Megamall tour. For here I am, about to enter Macy's, appalled and intrigued, determined to stay aloof, to be an observer, but with credit cards in my pocket. For Christmas, I've asked for some books, a bedside lamp, a pottery bowl. I didn't ask for a leather recliner, an espresso machine, tickets to Negril. But I'd like them all. My desires are doubdess driven by sockl norms and marketing, as Veblen says. But desire is driven also by cravings of spirit. I want leisure, comfort, the searing beauty of bougainvillea in January. Hold the psychic prattle, Veblen would say. As he wrote in Leisure Class, "The standard of expenditure which commonly guides our efforts is not the average, ordinary expenditure already achieved; it is an ideal of consumption that lies just beyond our reach. Or to reach which requires some strain. The motive is emulation." In other words, my cravings of spirit are merely another dreary violation of the ninth commandment, the injunction against material covetousness. I enter the mall on the third floor of Macy's, surrounded by families who joke about leaving the car in Nevada and arrange where to meet if someone gets lost. We are in the small-appliance department, the perfect place for a Veblenian critique since most of the electrified gadgets perform jobs once done more simply, by hand. Veblen was no foe of change. He prized technological innovation; he just wanted it to contribute to the common good. Many appliances have done just that. Once, at a history museum, I saw a photograph from the 1940s of women in hats and dresses gazing admiringly at a wall of shiny electric irons. Plugging in the steam iron is surely a big improvement over shoving hot flatirons across sizzling cotton. Permapressed is even better. This season's headliner appliances, with big displays on the major aisles, are electronic bread makers and heart monitors. Macy's is featuring the Panasonic bread maker, for $349.99, and the Gym Man Talking Heart Rate Monitor, for $99.90. In the photo on the Gym Man's carton, a muscular man climbs mythical steps on a StairMaster, his skin shining, his rib cage hugged by a chunky yellow belt that looks like a cameraman's battery pack. The belt plays music, counts his heartbeat and measures his elapsed time simultaneously. The bread maker's carton has photos of a white plastic box with many dials and a crested cube of brown bread.</page><page sequence="3">lynda McDonnell 185 There's clearly more than bread and pulse rates at issue. Veblen would quote John Stuart Mill: "It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being'" because?to use Veblen's words now?"as increased industrial efficiency makes it possible to procure the means of livelihood with less labor, the energies of the industrious members of the community are bent to the compassing of a higher result in conspicuous expen? diture, rather than slackened to a more comfortable pace." Veblen had other uses for his industry. To buy the freedom to say what he thought in eleven books on everything from social mores to German imperialism, he kept his wants modest. As a writer, he was never a big seller. As a teacher, he never stayed long enough at one institution to get tenure. So he lived simply and bartered for services. At Stanford, he provided a cottage and food to two students and their father in exchange for work done by the students. They cooked, kept things clean and took care of Veblen's horses. I doubt that he cared whether the bread was homemade. There is, of course, something wonderful about making bread the old, slow, manual way. The tough heel of the hand working the dough. The dough filling the pans as it swells with air. The air ripe with the scent of steaming loaves. There is also something wonderful about taking pulses. The summer I was eighteen, I worked as a nurse's aide, taking temperatures and pulses before breakfast. I also had to inquire about patients' bowel movements. How I hated asking. How cheerfully the elderly patients told me, happy for any sign of regularity. When I had recorded their answers, I touched my fingers to their cool, thin wrists and counted, my embarrassment fading against the weary cadence of old hearts. The electronic bread maker and pulse taker have status appeal? Veblen's "secondary utility as evidence of a relative ability to pay." They have mechanical exactitude. The Panasonic bread will not fail to rise. The Gym Man's pulse never falters. But something has been lost. No one would associate these machines with feeble bodies or the delicate stew of fermentation. They seem to defy the messiness of being human. John Kenneth Galbraith once wrote that Veblen "did what every thinking man would like to do if he had the time, the tenacity, and the mental endowment.. .. Taking all knowledge for his province, he climbed a mountaintop and surveyed the whole life of mankind." To read Veblen is to be amazed by his knowledge of obscure tribes, ancient history, British customs, ladies' fashion. What Galbraith called his "polysyllabic profundity" draws from the anthropology, sociology, psychology, technology and biology he read and learned about at the University of Chicago and Yale. His ideas draw too from a deep well of values. The values of hard work, ingenuity and sacrifice of self for others were shaped in part by his parents' example. His father was a</page><page sequence="4">186 THE HUDSON REVIEW farmer and skilled carpenter who set the pace for work crews and modified his house and barn constantly to make life easier and work profitable enough to send nine children to college. His mother was midwife and folk doctor to their small village. In Thorstein's account? ing of the world around him, everything is measured by its value to "the collective life." Even here at the Megamall, a place devoted to the satisfaction of private wants, there is recognition of our desire for life in community. Each of the broad aisles that make up the four-floor shopping cube has a street name and an architectural conceit: neon for East Broadway, lattices on North Garden, pushcarts on West Market, wood trim for South Avenue. Camp Snoopy, the amusement park at the Megamall's center, has concrete walkways scored and painted to look like flagstones. It is like Disney's idealized towns?relentlessly clean and cheerful, for visitors only. When meaner streets intrude?as when three young men were shot in Camp Snoopy over the attempted theft of a Starter jacket?few visitors noticed. They thought the gunfire was part of the ambience. The mall promotes itself as "a place for fun in your life." With the tinsel and clapper of Christmas, fun is flushed and teeming. In the atrium outside Macy's, a young pianist surrounded by poinsettias chases Rachmaninoff up and down the keyboard. The crowd is bigger in the atrium near Bloomingdale's, where a police band in blue trousers and white shirts plays a lively pastiche of Mozart and "Jingle Bells," Beethoven and "Silent Night." I think of other crowds I've joined, crowds that gathered more spontaneously to break the usual rules of public decorum. When the Minnesota Twins won the World Series, sensible citizens shinnied up light poles in delirious pleasure. When Hubert Humphrey died, lines of people who had met him once, twice or not at all waited on the chilly steps of the State Capitol for their turns to say goodbye. At such times, some fierce emotion or a desire to be part of the common history causes us to click off the TV, step outside and trespass boundaries between strangers. No one comes to a shopping mall in search of the commonweal. One comes to seek the weal. But even here, unbidden, connections are sometimes made. To the right of the stage, a blonde girl of eleven or twelve sits in a wheelchair. Her face is narrow and impassive, her eyes deeply set and private, her mouth agape. Behind her stand her parents. The father is a lean, worn man wearing cowboy boots and a brown silk jacket with a dragon stitched in bonfire colors across the back. The mother is soft and round with skin suffused with pink, as if she has just come from a steaming kitchen. As the band plays, she smoothes wisps of her daughter's hair back into a bun. When the child begins to rock, thrusting into the music again, again, the mother brightens like one who sees sunlight after months of rain. She smiles gently and squats</page><page sequence="5">lynda McDonnell w beside the unnoticing child to pat her hand. "You like that, don't you?" she says softly. "You like that." At the intersection of South Avenue and West Market, a clerk stands outside the Disney Store, beckoning. The place is almost impassible but I push gently in. I make my way slowly to the back, where a scene from Beauty and the Beast plays on the big screen. We move like cattle on a worn path, past stacks of Little Mermaid placemats, statues of Pinocchio and Cruella DeVille, racks of Aladdin barrettes and Cinderella fashion dolls, Donald Duck hats and blue Genie watches. Mickey Mouse is everywhere, on ties, brooches, jump ropes, golf balls, toothbrushes that talk. At the back of the store, beneath the big screen, is a sort of throne scene: Mickey and Minnie propped in the center of a huge pile of stuffed animals like ancestors atop a family tree. Scattered around the famous rodents are their anthropomorphic offspring: dwarves and dalmatians, flounder and crickets, skinny pigs and big-eared elephants, pink crustaceans and children who never grow up. A young woman in a Goofy sweatshirt wanders past. Her boyfriend is close behind her, walking in tandem. "Buy something," he urges. "But I don't know what to buy," she moans. "And you don't want anything." They turn left, toward the door. The boyfriend's palm is on the small of her back, pushing. I am taking notes about a lunch box shaped like Mickey's head when a female voice interrupts. "Making a Christmas list?" A clerk stands next to me, peering at my page. It looks like no one's Christmas list, a sprawl of product names and snatches of conversation. She gives up and looks at me. "Looking for anything special?" Like all the clerks in the Disney Store, this one looks like a Mousketeer without the saucer ears or the full curves that helped Annette Funicello graduate to beach-party films. My clerk is pale, slender, pleasant, with long, wavy brown hair, white socks and sneakers, a pleated skirt and a cardigan with a blocky M on the left pocket. The costume says Family Entertainment. It says Good, Clean Fun. I feel sheepish, as if caught spraying graffiti on Cinderella's castle. I turn to a blank page in my notebook and tell her of my nine-year-old nephew with cerebral palsy. She leads me to a rack of plastic tumblers with straws that pop up when the lids are turned. I choose one. Between the double wall of plastic is a scene from Aladdin sealed in a film of water. When I shake it, a dozen tiny lanterns float past. "It'll keep his interest," she promises. "And it won't look like he needs a special cup. Even teenagers like them." I buy the cup. My nephew will like it. I like it too. But I am embarrassed. The plastic Mickey Mouse bag hanging from my wrist marks the difference between an idealized asceticism, where we take only what is studied and necessary and beautiful, and the reality of</page><page sequence="6">188 THE HUDSON REVIEW mass consumption, where we choose what is clever, affordable and promises some kind of pleasure. How did Veblen handle Christmas? He didn't say. For all his books, he was intensely private and left few personal papers. Perhaps his resentment of "devout observances" and lack of children allowed him to ignore the whole business. But he too had nieces and nephews. Perhaps he gave only sensible things?underwear and thick socks. He built chairs and a cabin for himself, so perhaps he used his carpentry skills to make clever toys from scraps of wood. Or perhaps, as one who admired innovation, he too would buy a cup suited to a boy with trembling hands. When my family visited at Thanksgiving, it was the mall's size and variety that impressed them. My father could play miniature golf with my sons. My mother could shop for clothes with my sister. Another sister could take her young son to bounce in the inflated Snoopy or sit on Santa's lap. In the food court, one person could eat hot dogs, another pizza, a third egg foo yung. Another family with yet more far-flung tastes used a cellular phone to keep track of one another. Today, I brought a sandwich. As I sit on a metal bench and eat it, the gesture seems small and cranky, the sort my tightwad neighbor would indulge. I have not Veblen's stamina for separateness. I keep stumbling from the mountaintop to see what's happening down below. A crowd has gathered at the benches outside Glamour Shots. They are men and women, mostly older, and a few weary children, staring through a wall of glass at plain women, plump women, women like your neighbor or your sister or your deskmate being transformed into versions of the big-eyed, big-haired, high-colored female, the lounge singer, NFL cheerleader, game-show assistant. "Our sense of costliness often masquerades under the name of beauty," Veblen wrote. "We readily and for the most part, with utter sincerity, find those things pleasing that are in vogue." He inveighed against the corsets and hoop skirts of his day. By hobbling women and making them merely ornamental, such fashions made them the chattel of men, he pointed out. Fashions have changed. The orna? mental emphasis on women has not. Every makeup counter sells larger eyes, fuller lips, higher cheekbones than nature produced. Glamour Shots sells a bigger package, a foxier look preserved on film. "Before to After?only 2 hours," the sign says. I settle on the bench to watch. On the other side of the glass, three women sit in chairs before huge mirrors framed with light bulbs. They wear black smocks over black tube tops and businesslike expressions. Each has paid $29.95 to be worked over by a stylist wielding curling iron and hair spray, pots of blush and tubes of eyeliner. They will pay more for photos. After her hair is teamed and her cheeks rouged, each woman will choose a</page><page sequence="7">lynda McDonnell 189 sequined jacket from a rack, costume jewelry from a chest and disappear into a darkened studio. Right now, on the monitor above our heads, a young woman with short hair and a flashbulb smile mugs in a fur stole, then a sequined dress, then a Twins uniform. Each time the shutter snaps, the moment appears on a second screen, preserved on film. The screen makes private fantasy into public entertainment. In one chair behind the glass sits a plump woman of about thirty with walnut-colored skin and the straight, glossy hair of a Native American. Her daughter, who is about six and wears her hair in pigtails, squirms on the next chair. The child too wears a black smock and waits her turn at dress-up. The grandmother, a short, round woman with gray hair pulled into a bun, sits on the bench next to me. The child beckons her to the glass and pushes a bobbypin through the crack where two panels meet. The old woman takes it, nodding, understanding that the child will need it later, when the hairspray has lost its force. Perhaps she knows too that the child who waits for curls and sequins and rouged lips needs connection with the plain, the patient, the ordinary. Another woman, big and young, emerges from the studio with cascades of blonde curls falling to her bare shoulders. In the bright light, she is suddenly shy and holds her hand modestly to her chest. As she and her boyfriend look at proofs and point to the photos they want, she removes the large earrings and rubs her earlobes. The choices made, she puts on her T-shirt and jean jacket and they return to the mall. In the blue shadow of fluorescent light, she looks garish, like Christmas colors out of season. As beauty is lure to America's women, sports is to its men. The Megamall offers sports bars, sports videos, sporting goods and sportswear. There is a mall-walking club and a miniature golf course. Shoppers can buy sneakers with high tops and air cushions and turquoise laces, chocolate wrapped as soccer balls and chips-and-dip bowls shaped like football helmets. One shop sells baseballs signed by men who played in the stadium that formerly stood on the Megamall site. A Rod Carew goes for $79.95. Many stores have televisions mounted on the wall so that patrons can drink or shop without missing a play. Veblen was no ivory-tower wimp. One summer, he explored much of Norway by bicycle. But he had the farmboy's rich disdain for pretensions, especially the "rant and swagger and ostensible mystifi? cation" he found in sports like football and hunting. Too much fondness for sports "marks an arrested development in man's moral nature," he wrote. How he would goggle at America's Original Sports Bar in the Megamall. You enter as through a vestibule, past a case holding scuffed shoes and soiled jerseys, relics of Famous Players in Big Games. Suddenly, you are in a dark, cavernous room dotted with pools of reverent light. One of them illumines a huge trophy of plastic</page><page sequence="8">190 THE HUDSON REVIEW or Styrofoam, painted matte silver and suspended over the bar like a fetish. Another light reveals two men hunched over a pool table, calculating angles. On the far wall are a dozen vigilant television screens showing football games past or present. One offers a jumble of shoulder pads, buttocks and turf?the player's view. It is an electronic game that allows one to make a play without risk of torn cartilage or spilled beer. A sign explains: "Virtuality?Experience Illusion Fusion." Here, by adulation or electronic simulation, we can all be athletes. There is no rant and swagger. Neither is there sign of a collective life. One pale, fat man wearing shorts and a T-shirt sits on the top row of a small bleacher. Alone in the dark, he sips beer and watches athletes collide on a big screen. On the first floor, there is Santa's house, with walls lacquered red as a candied apple and a winding lane of restless children, waiting their turn at the old man's ear. As I pass by, the blonde child in the wheelchair has her chance. Her chair has been pulled alongside Santa's to face the camera. Her father sits at her feet, trying to coax a smile. But the child has withdrawn deep inside herself and is calmly impassive. Santa's rouged cheeks and her father's words cannot reach her as the music did. I feel for the father, longing for proof of his child's pleasure. And yet I admire the girl who has not learned to fake happiness. Without the capacity to dissemble, she holds out for real pleasure. Before I leave, I climb to a balcony that overlooks the mall's central atrium. Above is a roof of crimped glass. Below are Camp Snoopy with its whirling rides, potted trees and towering balloon of Charlie Brown's dog. It is a god's view, or a pigeon's, and it is pleasant. The calliope's shrill music is muted by distance. Silverware clinks agreeably at a nearby restaurant. The carnival colors brighten the winter grayness. The risen air feels warmed and softened by prior use. Perhaps it is the sticky smell of caramel corn or the arcade's gaudy lights that reminds me of the state fair. But no, that's different. That is twelve days in late August and early September when ordinary people's jams and gladiola and green beans share the stage with Dolly Parton and U.S. senators. Because it is fleeting, because each partic? ipant has taken great care in the cake she made or the chicken he raised, the ordinary becomes exceptional. At the Megamall, the fair goes on year-round. It is never closed for the season. It never moves to another town. It is a fixture, a business, not a celebration. My mind flashes to the scene in Pinocchio where the truant boys take a coach to Pleasure Island. After they have sickened themselves with sweets, exhausted themselves on rides and broken every window, they turn brutish in form as well as manner. All but Pinocchio are turned</page><page sequence="9">lynda McDonnell 191 into pack mules for the salt mines. He alone escapes by leaping into the sea. But his mulish tail and ears remain until he is redeemed by his own shame and Gepetto's love. I think of Thorstein Veblen, still attended to long after his death because his originality and conviction endure. I try to envision the Megamall a century hence and see nothing. Born of novelty and consumption, it seems likely to be devoured by the same. But the Megamall dwells in the pulse of the present, not the lessons of history or the dreams of the future. Across the atrium from where I stand, the roller coaster's track dips and curves like a barn swallow. Just now, a train full of flushed riders climbs, swerves, tilts on its side, then plunges on the rail's fixed flight through the park. The riders raise their arms and scream. They are excited and terrified as they hurtle unthinking through time. Lynda McDonnell</page></plain_text>
