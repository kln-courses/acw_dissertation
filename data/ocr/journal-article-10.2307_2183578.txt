Stockholm, Diakonistyrelsens Bokf6rlag, I966. Pp. 266. 48 Skr. In many ways Anders Jeffner's study of Butler and Hume is intel- lectual history rather than philosophy (or theology). For one thing, Jeffner studs his chapters with summaries of Aquinas, Locke, Hutcheson, John Wilkins,John Ray, Boyle, George Cheyne, and others. Again, it is an important part ofJeffner's aim (and an important part of his accomplishment) to place Butler and Hume in their proper historical context. In at least one very important respect, however, Jeffner's work is certainly philosophy. Jeffner is preoccupied with arguments. He iso- lates arguments; he writes out premises, definitions, and principles in blackboard fashion; he highlights concepts, and he labels everything. He then presents much of what he has to say about Butler and Hume as explicit commentary on these neatly labeled arguments and argu- ment-bits. His procedure clarifies important connections and yields valuable insights. Where Jeffner disappoints is in a certain impatience, a desire to get on to the next numbered statement or the next bit of background material. One would like him to tease out all the treas- ures of philosophical duplicity, temptation, and perplexity cached in 369</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS those cleanly numbered statements. Too often one has to be satisfied with a few judicious, sometimes shrewd, but usually rather businesslike comments. In discussing, for example, the idea that a miracle is an event that does not occur in accordance with any law, Jeffner points out that this notion would make it a necessary condition for recognizing a miracle that one know what all the laws of nature are. (In fact, we should need to know more; we should need to know that we know all the laws.) Jeffner adds the comment, "This condition is difficult to fulfill, and ... it is a premise for other arguments in Butler that it should not be fulfilled" (pp. i i6-i I 7). If we put aside problems about what Butler can consistently say (I shall return to that matter later on), the main trouble is surely not that such a condition is difficult to fulfill, as though only the most learned of men would be in position to recognize a true miracle. What would it be like to know all the laws of nature-or, worse, to know that one knows them all? I suppose it might turn out that every time we tried to predict (or retrodict) something on the basis of known laws, we succeeded. This complete success might sug- gest that we had a complete list of laws. But the notion of a miracle under discussion would be applicable only if our success were incom- plete-only if, that is, we could notice that something happens that fails to accord with any law. Thus we should be able to apply this notion of a miracle only on condition that it is inapplicable. Jeffner presents Butler as assuming both that God's existence has already been satisfactorily proved (p. 70) and that the world is known to be a "teleological system" (pp. io8-i io). Butler's task is then to show that the laws that can be seen to govern this teleological system are such as to make Christianity sufficiently probable for it to be a reasonable "guide of life." Hume, according to Jeffner, answers Butler in two main ways. First, he argues that such "laws" as Butler supposes govern what happens in this world are arbitrarily selected and inadequately supported by evidence. Second, he undercuts Butler's two assumptions with the following dilemma: either the view that the world is a teleological system "cannot be made sufficiently probable by correct arguments from the facts of experience" or else "if it does become probable, it becomes also religiously uninteresting" (p. 239). (It would become religiously uninteresting if it led to the conclusion that God is either a very limited and anthropomorphic being or else a totally incomprehensible one.) All this seems right. But now our interest is aroused. What is Hume showing when he shows that there is a "certain arbitrariness" (pp. io9- 370</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS i i o) about Butler's laws? On the first page of The Analogy of Religion Butler identifies the following as "a general law of nature in our own species" and "in other creatures": (a) ... that the same creatures, the same individuals, should exist in degrees of life and perception, with capacities of action, of enjoyment and suffering, in one period of their being, greatly different from those appointed them in another period of it [Jeffner, p. go]. Butler has in mind the transformations from "the helpless infancy" of human beings to "mature age," "the change of worms into flies," and so forth. But what about counterinstances to this "law"? What about, say, earthworms? Do they falsify (a) ? Or does (a) not apply to them? Butler is silent. He seems to treat (a) as nothing more than an umbrella for those age-old analogies of metamorphosis that have long encouraged men in their hope for immortality. On the second page of his Analogy Butler states what Jeffner takes to be a second general law, namely: (b) ... there is in every case a probability, that all things will continue as we experience they are, in all respects, except in those in which we have some reason to think they will be altered [Jeffner, p. 9i]. The reference here to what "we have some reason to think will be altered" makes (b) a principle about what we are justified in think- ing rather than a principle about what happens. It belongs to the family of principles and maxims that certain philosophers have thought we must appeal to in making inductive inferences. It is, therefore- prima facie, anyway-very different from (a). What are (a) and (b) supposed to have in common with each other and with the rest of Butler's "general laws"-with, for example, "the general law that people's actions are always rewarded and punished" (p. 93) ? Jeffner does not tell us. He suggests that Butler arrives at his laws by trying to "read a certain 'intent of Nature' into what happens" (p. 96). And he says the laws Butler finds "are in some way prescriptive, like the laws passed by men" (pp. i08-io9). But he fails to show how even these isolated general comments fit the specific laws themselves. He leaves us suspecting that Butler's notion of a general law (and therefore his whole conception of a "teleological system") is a dreadful muddle. But he fails to help us understand what the muddle is or how Butler got into it. Still, Jeffner's accomplishment is considerable. He lays out Butler and Hume in a helpfully systematic fashion. In his commentary he 37'</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS makes good use of a wide range of relevant literature, including not only other writings on Butler and Hume, but also the work of such present-day philosophers as Wisdom, Wittgenstein, Stevenson, and Frankena. The result is often a new and rewarding way of reading the old texts. On the vexed question of who speaks for Hume in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, for example, Jeffner first finds plausible prototypes among Hume's contemporaries for Demea, Cleanthes, and Philo (he suggests persuasively that Philo-including the final avid flight to revealed truth-is modeled on Pierre Bayle); Jeffner then argues ingeniously that "Hume has assigned something of his own view to each of the three characters in such a way that his own view emerges in the points on which two of the characters are in agreement against the third" (p. 207). Jeffner's interpretation justifies Hume's verdict on his own work: "I find that nothing can be more cautiously and more artfully written" (Jeffner, p. 208). Throughout this book Jeffner shows a strong interest in getting straight exactly what Butler and Hume thought. And he obviously has a serious interest in getting straight the very matters Butler and Hume wanted to get straight. If we are to fault him, it must be for not showing us how tantalizingly difficult the latter project is. GARETH B. MATTHEWS University of Minnesota</page></plain_text>
