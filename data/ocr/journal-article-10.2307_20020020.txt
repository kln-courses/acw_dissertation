<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1999 The Businessman as Protagonist in Veblen and Schumpeter Franco Ferrarotti I The working classes, according to Karl Marx, hold the key to human liberation. However, contrary to a widespread misconception, Marx does not ennoble or sentimentalize the proletariat either in general or as individ ual actors. Indeed, in order to distinguish themselves from the ideological proponents of utopianism or voluntaristic socialism, Marx and Engels rigor ously maintained an analytic distance from their object of study, resulting in a point of view they held to be more sober, scientific, and realistic. For example, Marx reports, upon the achievement of a technical innovation that served to standardize and enhance productive efficiency e.g., the auto mation of the handloom or the design of a flexible lathe; employers moved quickly to replace long-time workers with women, a supposedly more mal leable and manipulable "human material." The very ignoble and unsenti mental response of workingmen was to embrace a new role as slave mer chants eager to "sell" their wives and daughters to the factories and then rush off to the local pub. At one level, an example such as this illustrates Marx's unwillingness to adhere to the strictly theoretical orientation of Hegel, of whom he was certainly an appreciative student. It also offers evidence of Marx's unusual ability to creatively connect aspects of social life that "common sense" would hold to be completely alien or irrelevant to each other. It seems curious, therefore, that Marx did not apply this ability to the actions of capitalists. Indeed, although he wrote at length about the structure and operations of capitalism as a system, capitalists as social actors scarcely even make an appearance. Even when Marx analytically works out the internal contradictions of capitalist production?the short circuit caused by maximizing profits through overproduction and the concomitant under 241 ? 1999 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">242 Ferrarotti consumption that results from declining wages?the agents and protagonists of the process remain silent and anonymous in the background. Marx intended his approach to the understanding of capitalism to be scientific and impersonal, to follow what Veblen referred to as a "mechanis tic logic" that is devoid of animism and anthropomorphism. He was not entirely successful in doing so, at least as Veblen understood it, for Marx's analysis retained a kind of animistic impetus embedded in the teleological elements of historical materialism, against which Veblen set a Darwinian notion of social development as a blindly cumulative sequence. Veblen's commentaries on Marxism provide a useful point of departure for an exami nation of his own understanding of the capitalist actor and his social role. Almost uniquely among the American intellectuals of his day, Veblen demonstrated an impressive understanding of the multifaceted nature and complexity of Marxism as a system.1 He understood that a piecemeal cri tique would be ineffective because it would fail to confront the fundamental logical structure of Marxism: its Hegelian dialectical framework.2 "Except as a whole and except in the light of its postulates and aims," Veblen argues, "the Marxian system is not only not tenable, but it is not even intelligible. A discussion of a given isolated feature of the system (such as the theory of value) from the point of view of classical economics (such as that offered by B?hm-Bawerck) is as futile as a discussion of solids in terms of two dimensions."3 Dedicated Marxists have long suffered difficulties in confronting Ve blen's critique on intellectual grounds, and so, for the most part, have favored disputing Veblen's credentials rather than his argument. In a discus sion of The Theory of the Leisure Class, for example, Paul Baran was satisfied to dismiss Veblen as a "bourgeois theorist" and "bourgeois histo rian." "Like other bourgeois theorists," Baran wrote, ... Veblen has recourse to invoking del ex machina as an ultimate means of interpre tation. And again, as in the case of most bourgeois historians, Veblen's wisdoms of last resort are always of a biological or psychological nature, have always some thing to do with 'basic' racial characteristics of men or with the no less 'fundamental' structure of their motivations... Veblen never relinquishes his biological-psycholog ical apparatus .. .4 Baran's collaborator, Paul M. Sweezy, considered Veblen to be merely "a theorist who dealt almost wholly in generalities and hardly ever introduced a statistic into his writings..." Sweezy does concede, however, that "Veblen's general diagnosis of the 'state of the nation' is ... astonishingly accurate and if anything more relevant to 1957 than to 1904 or 1923."5 One might add that it is perhaps even more relevant to 1999. For Marx, the productive energy of human beings generates a surplus which is appropriated or stolen by the capitalists and reinvested by them</page><page sequence="3">Businessman as Protagonist 243 for their own exclusive benefit. Marx's argument on this point, according to Veblen, presumes a rationalism of personal motives that would presum ably "fall into a sequence of logical consistency." This "romantic (Marxian) sequence of theory," however, has been intellectually imposed by the theo rist. As such it is "essentially an intellectual sequence, and it is therefore of a teleological character."6 Veblen counters that there is no assurance that the surplus will be used rationally by human beings. In this respect, Veblen's position is closer to that of Vilfredo Pareto than to Marx. Without the benefit of having read Freud, he recognizes that irrational expressions of "conspicuous waste" are accompanied by subliminal motivations and "psychic income" in the form of social respectability. Veblen's critique of economic hedonism and of the purported rational ism o? homo economicus sharpened his insight into the unanticipated conse quences of irrational behavior patterns. He was thus able to anticipate with impressive precision both the Dialectics of Aufkl?rung of Horkheimer and Adorno and the broader critique of illusory capitalistic rationality that forms the backbone of the Frankfurt School. He understood, for example, how the sportsmanlike propensities of the masses, whose passions and allegiances are captured by mass sporting events, could be manipulated and politically exploited by political leaders who are well versed in the quite rational art of propaganda. Adorno dismissed Veblen as a crude technocrat and hater of culture as such, but long before the Frankfurt School, Veblen had already identified some specific features of the mass society and mass culture and pointed to specific expressions of the crisis of nineteenth century values, such as the concept of the self-sufficient grand individu and the Weberian notion that even the gambler playing the stock market is rational, at least to the extent that he follows the laws of proba bility. II In his critiques of Marx and in his own work on the operations of capitalism as a system, Veblen clearly regarded abstract categories and overarching economic conceptualizations to be inadequate as either theo retical explanations or tools of analysis. To his mind, the intellectual em brace of such abstractions would prevent the development of economics as an "evolutionary science" and preclude an examination of behavioral styles and psychological motivations that is needed to achieve a scientific understanding of capitalism as a dynamic global phenomenon. His strictures and warnings regarding this point are in fact not restricted to Marx's work, but apply equally well to that of another economist and Veblen contempo</page><page sequence="4">244 Ferrarotti rary, Eugen von B?hm-Bawerk, a standard bearer of the "Austrian School," which also includes such figures as Friedrich August von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises. Indeed, as Joseph Schumpeter remarked, there is in fact "a certain parallelism between Marx and B?hm-Bawerk."7 Both were ani mated by a scientific orientation in the nineteenth century sense, and both sought to identify the overarching laws which they assumed governed the economic process. But the analyses of neither left much room for a consider ation of human motivations, psychologies and states of mind. By contrast, it is one of the great merits of Veblen's analysis of capitalism to have paid special attention to the historical figure, motivational structures, and actual role of the businessman. To speak of the businessman is to risk analytic imprecision, for the term actually incorporates a number of different roles and orientations. A generally accepted set of contemporary distinctions among businessmen, for example, include 1) the capitalist, or owner of capital; 2) the entrepre neur, or man of ideas who seeks profit through productive innovation; and 3) the professional manager, or functionally responsible administrator. In the 1890s, Alfred Marshall, in his Principles of Economics, had already further subdivided the entrepreneur's role into three major functions: man agement, innovation, and riskbearing. Veblen goes further, drawing a sharp distinction between the "captain of industry" and the "captain of business." The captain of industry, who he sees personified in the engineer, has a rational interest in growth. He is therefore intrinsically community-minded and shows no inclination to artificially restrict production and trade. By contrast, the captain of business is essentially a brasseur d'affaires, a specula tor who attempts "to get something for nothing." Historically, he corre sponds perfectly with the emergence of purely financial capitalism or, in the Marxian tradition, with the "last stage of capitalism" as elaborated by Lenin and Rudolf Hilferding. Despite accusations by sociologists and economists that Veblen's distinction is too crude, its contemporary rele vance is made evident by the deepening globalization of the world economy. Some of Veblen's critics used his equation of the engineer with the captain of industry to denounce the whole of Veblen's work as a justification of technocracy. Without doubt, Veblen's equation of the two is untenable. But while all businessmen are inextricably connected to the business culture, Veblen insists that businessmen devoted to rational economic growth (whether they are engineers or not) cannot be confused with speculators who use production for their own "dynastic" purposes. According to Veblen, modern industrial development operates ac cording to a "mechanistic logic" that is destined to override any restraints grounded in "natural rights." Even Adam Smith, as he constructed the foundations of economic liberalism and extolled the market as a nearly</page><page sequence="5">Businessman as Protagonist 245 perfect arbiter among free individuals, was already out of step with the requirements of what Veblen presciently refers to as "the post-modern era." Our feet, Veblen suggests, may walk the terrain of modernity but our heads?laws, customs and institutions?lag behind, reflecting habits and values of the Middle Ages. "The Industrial Revolution," argued Veblen, "does not lie with Adam Smith's 'historical present,' nor does his system of economic doctrines make provision for any of its peculiar issues. What he has to say on the mechanics of industry is conceived in terms derived from an older order of things than that machine industry which was beginning to get under way in his own lifetime."8 For Veblen, the fundamental problem facing the contemporary world is established by the "discrepancy between business and industry." In practice, however, this "discrepancy" is not some small imbalance or retarded devel opment of the sort suggested by Ogburn's notion of cultural lag. Indeed, in the modern world "the machine industries ... are in a dominant position ..." and "the businessman ... has become a controlling force in industry."9 This dominant businessman, moreover, is no simple engineer. He certainly understands and controls the productive process, usually by delegating authority, but his control is not based exclusively on expertise. To gain the higher ranks of business management usually also requires special attachments of family, banking relationships, political relationships, old school ties, or some other personal connections. These are accepted as a guarantee of loyalty, trust, ideological allegiance and, ultimately, active operational complicity. Ill Veblen's image of the businessman is very much at odds with that of Joseph Schumpeter. For Schumpeter, the businessman is neither an engi neer nor a captain of business nor a business bureaucrat. He is, rather, of necessity, a man of ideas, an innovator. At times he is an outsider, a marginal man whose very marginality nourishes his creativity. Essentially, he is an inventor. Businessmen of this type oversaw the emergence of Polaroid, Xerox and, more recently, Microsoft. Curiously, Schumpeter was unable to find an appropriate English language term with which to capture his notion of the businessman, and so he chose to use the French word "entre preneur." At times he also uses the term "promoter," but this is clearly misleading as it brings to mind images of the propagandist or salesman for already existing products. According to Schumpeter, it is this innovative, creative, and even subversive and revolutionary businessman who is most responsible for</page><page sequence="6">246 Ferrarotti economic development. Other contributions, such as those made by mate rial resources and traditional habits of mind, are of secondary importance. As a result, not all businessmen are deserving of the appellation "entrepre neur." In this sense, Jean-Baptiste Say's classic definition that "the entrepre neurial function consists in uniting and combining the various production factors" is too broadly drawn, for it misses the dynamic dimension that for Schumpeter is the essential feature of entrepreneurialism. Say's understanding of economic development remains connected to a notion of the "circular flow of economic life." As such it neglects the additional and necessary ingredient of profit, which results from innovations that disrupt the "flow" and break through established routines in any field of industrial production. A central point for Schumpeter is that in the "circular flow of economic life" the creation of real profits is not possible. Following production and consumption, the initial economic conditions are resumed, at least according to the logic of homeostatic models. Even consumption goods themselves do not accumulate. Rather, "consumption goods are generally in the hands of retailers and consumers only in quanti ties that are necessary to meet the requirements of the moment."10 In the "circular flow" the typical capitalist lives well and is tranquil and satisfied with life. He is familiar with others with whom he does business. He, and they, do not like to be taken by surprise, but like everything to be predict able. The entrepreneur, by contrast, thrives on novelty. He does not simply move to meet market demands but is himself a creator of new markets. He stirs the market out of static equilibrium and throws dynamic challenges to established habits and ways of thinking ... The tone of Schumpeter's descriptions of the entrepreneur is almost romantic, a paean to the capitalist economic demiurge. The development and evolution of the businessman as a social actor has, of course, been widely discussed, but Veblen was among the first to describe it in specific terms. "Since the modern era began," he wrote the state of the industrial arts has been undergoing a change of type, such as the followers of Mendel would call a 'mutation.' And in the course of this mutation the workman and his part in the conduct of industry has suffered as great a dislocation as any of the other factors involved. But it is also to be admitted that the typical owner-employer of the earlier modern time, such as he stood in the mind's eye of the eighteenth century doctrinaires?this traditional owner-employer has also come through the period of the mutation in a scarcely better state of preservation ... he could still truthfully be spoken of as a 'master,' a foreman of the shop ... The personal owner-employer has virtually disappeared from the great industries. His place is now filled by a list of corporation securities and a staff of corporation officials and employees who exercise a limited discretion.11 Schumpeter is less analytic, insisting on profit as both the fundamental index and instrument of dynamic corporate development. On this point he is trenchant:</page><page sequence="7">Businessman as Protagonist 247 Entreprenurial profit is not a rent like the return to differential advantages in the permanent elements of a business; nor is it a return to capital, however one may define capital... We want finally to emphasize that profit is also not wages, although the analogy is tempting. It is certainly not a simple residuum; it is the expression of the value of what the entrepreneur contributes to production in exactly the same sense that wages are the value expression of what the worker "produces." It is not a profit of exploitation any more than are wages.12 Schumpeter's placement of wages and profits on the same level sharply and substantively separates his position from that of Veblen. What for Schumpeter is the result of almost "charismatic" individual creativity is for Veblen the product of shrewd and often fraudulent actions by captains of business. In Veblen's analysis, especially in The Theory of Business Enter prise, the romantic aura of Schumpeter's entrepreneur is exploded and shown to be grounded in naivete if not subservience to the prevailing interests. This last point gains further support when one considers Schum peter's uncritical acceptance of profit as an unqualified value. Schumpeter's text on this point is a dogmatic profession of faith: "Without development there is no profit; without profit, no development."13 To deflate such enthusiasm, one need only raise some simple Veblenian questions: Is the issue development or expansion? Development, and profit, for whom? Against whom? For what and against what? Veblen's cautious skepticism anticipates contemporary debates over the basic requirements for a balanced ecological system. His position, in underscoring the conflict between a narrowly considered pursuit of profits and a community-con scious and efficient industrial management, retains a contemporary vitality and urgency.
