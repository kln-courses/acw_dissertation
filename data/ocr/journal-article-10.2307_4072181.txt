<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rose Beetle Poisonous to Young Birds.- In 1914, Mr. Ernest Napier, President of the New Jer'sey Fish and Game Commission reported to the Biological Survey the loss of hundreds of pheasant chicks and of numerous young ducks and chickens from eating rose beetles (Macro- dactylus subspinosus). Four young Ring-necked Pheasants were examined and rose beetles found to compose 48, 30, 50 and 17 per cent respectively of their food. The largest number of rose beetles in any one was 12. The crops of these birds were only from one-fourth to three-fourths full and thoroughly ground up remains of the beetles were present in each gizzard, showing that the insects were being digested in regular course. There being no evidence of crop binding, to which the trouble had been attri- buted,' and a positive diagnosis of white diarrhcea being obtained, it was concluded that the rose beetles were not the direct cause of the mortality. It is of great interest, therefore, that the rose beetle has recently been discovered to " contain a neuro-toxin that has an effect upon the heart action of both chickens and rabbits and is excessively dangerous as a food for chickens." 2 In experimental feeding of rose beetles to young chicks death resulted in from 9 to 24 hours. Similar results were obtained with an extract of rose chafers. Resistance to the poison increased rapidly with the age of the chicks and none over ten weeks old was killed. Besides the obvious economic aspect of this discovery, and the indicated necessity of keeping young domesticated birds away from rose-beetles, the facts have an interesting bearing on the theory of " protected " insects and their warning colors. This, a poisonous insect according to the theory 1 Prof. F. E. L. Beal informs the writer that it is sometimes necessary to open the crops of young turkeys because of clogging up by rose bugs. 2 Lamson, George H., Jr.- The poisonous effects of the rose chafer upon chickens.

Auk should have bright warning colors, yet is of a uniform and inconspicuous brownish yellow. According to hypothesis, furthermore, birds are sup- posed to learn about disagreeable insects when young and thus be trained when adult to ignore them. In this case, however, experiment is usually followed by death, so that experience is not conserved. What is more, the insect is not dangerous to adult birds, so that, adopting this style of argu- ment for the moment, early bad experience probably would be overcome by later satisfactory trials. We do not know whether eating rose chafers has a bad effect upon the young of wild birds, but we do know that the adults of a number of species feed upon these insects. So far, rose-beetles have been found in stomachs of 12 wild species. The Kingbird seems especially fond of them, from 12 to 40 rose-chafers being found in each of several collected stomachs. The case is analogous to that of numerous birds feeding extensively upon the fruits of poison sumacs. A known poisonous principle, which at first thought we should be inclined to consider a preventive against eating by wild animals, is proved by the observed facts to have no such effect. Other analogies are by no means rare, and it would seem that if carefully pondered, they would serve to check the enthusiasm with which anthropomorphic explanations of animal behavior are advanced.- W.
