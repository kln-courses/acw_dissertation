LETTERS OF GEORGE ADE, ed. Terence Tobin, with Foreword by Paul Fatout. Purdue University Studies, 1973.252 pp. $9.75. This selection of letters should be especially welcome because Ade devoted probably as much time to writing letters as he did to writing his humorous fa- bles. During the Depression the demand for Ade's work diminished, and he increased the amount of his correspondence, often writing as many as thirty letters a week. The editor's statement in the Introduction that this selection forms "a patchwork of popular history and autobiography" is quite true. In one letter Ade speculates about the true authorship of "The Banks of the Wabash"; in another he narrates a hilarious story about a gambling party at which the guests used stage money and thereby thwarted any action which scandalized citizens might have taken; in another he provides extensive ad- vice for someone who wants to write for the popular stage. The volume in- cludes a reminiscence and commentary by Paul Fatout and an excellent in- troduction by the editor which conveys admirably a sense of both the man and the work.

This study concentrates upon the poetry between 1912-1922 since this period has been insufficiently examined and since too little work after 1922 is available for any balanced judgment to be made. This early poetry is generally personal and includes the themes of love, of war, and of the Russian cultural heritage, especially the contrast between the old Russia and the new. Though Driver realizes that much of Akhmatova's special quality is lost in prose translation, he does include translations of many poems in the hope that the universality of theme will communicate the force of the poet. , .

MOAN, Purdue University In recent months, Cornell University Press has published two studies of W. H. Auden's poetry: Frederick Buell's W. H. Auden as a Social Poet and Richard Johnson's Man's Place: An Essay on Auden. And spanning as they do the early and late poetry, these books help the reader to appreciate the scope and interrelatedness of Auden's work. Buell's study "focuses on the years in which Auden's social vision was in its formative stage, the 1930's the years of his flirtation with and abandonment of left-wing politics." Such a focus is a bit risky for an Auden critic since 268</page><page sequence="5">Auden's work in the 1930s is probably the most analyzed segment of the Auden canon. Still, there is much to be said about that decade in Auden's poetic career, and Buell manages to say a good deal. Buell employs an essentially chronological structure and approaches his account of Auden's emergence as a social poet from biographical-historical and technical perspectives. Using the Mortmere fantasy as his basis, Buell describes the tension in Auden's work in the 1930s and indeed throughout his career "between rebellious parodic gesture and tacit or overt appeal for general readership approval and participation." Mortmere and the fantasies which succeeded it allowed Auden to "try on" revolutionary roles but never, according to Buell, spurred him to revolution. Buell explores Auden's revo- lutionary role-playing in "Mortmere," one of the best sections in his study, and he makes some very fine distinctions between fantasy as utilized by Auden and fantasy as a tool of the German Dadaists with whom Auden has so often been compared. Indeed, Buell's presentation of Auden's experiences in Germany and his description of Germanic influences in Auden's thought and poetry are first- rate; Buell's biographical-historical perspective is a much more successful angle of vision in his study than is the technical perspective of W. H. Auden as a Social Poet. One yearns for a stronger emphasis on the noun "Poet" in Buell's title-for some truly incisive close readings of Auden's poetry. But, except for the plays, Buell's direct encounters with Auden's work are much less satisfying than his encounters with Auden's world. Close reading, on the other hand, is the great strength of Richard Johnson's Man's Place: An Essay on Auden. Johnson relies on very thorough poetic analyses to support his contention that the one constant in Auden's work of the last thirty years is "the notion that man has an ethical need to know his place in the world." Throughout his study, Johnson emphasizes poetic techniques diction, syntax, voice, perspective and the manipu- lation of those techniques in Auden's search for"paradigms of existence." Because of this very concentrated emphasis on Auden's poetic structures, Johnson is able, as few critics have been, to demonstrate the close relation- ship between poetic technique and poetic vision in Auden's work. The very detailed explication of New Year Letter in the first chapter is but one of many examples of Johnson's ability to link technical and thematic patterns. But even as one praises Johnson's concentration on Auden's structures, one has some reservations about the structure of Man's Place. Johnson uses a topical structure as he moves from comprehensive chapters, one through three, in which specific techniques are examined in a large body of poetry to his final three chapters which focus on the structures of Bucolics, Horae Ca- nonicae, and Thanksgiving for a Habitat. At times transitions within and be- tween the comprehensive chapters are non-existent or difficult to follow. Johnson himself seems aware of this problem when he states in the "Pre- face": "Whenever a choice had to be made between organizational tidiness and full discussion of a poem, I have chosen the latter, partly on general prin- ciple and partly in response to the exploratory spirit that seems to me to dominate the poems." In the course of a first reading, one may not applaud Johnson's choice; but by the end of that reading and in subsequent readings of this study, one finds the book's great value in Johnson's willingness to choose in favor of Auden's poetry. Clearly, Johnson never loses sight of criticism's role as illuminator rather than supplanter of the primary work. 269 </page><page sequence="6">W. H. AUDEN C Beallr Eugenie Reagan.

Since Black Literature has included a narrow range of themes and since few claim5 can be made for it on purely aesthetic groundst a certain lack of assurance on the part of critics has resulted in rather undistinguished criticism. Stanley Macebuh attempts to construct a critical method for deaZing with Elack L;terature as well as to analy7e the development of James Baldwin. Macebuh asserts that a continuous tradition of Black Literature exists which links politics and literature. Moreovert he advocates a criticism which is cultural rather than practical. However, he believes that Baldwin was at his technical best when he wrote out of his personal experience as he did early in his career, Part of Baldwin's difficulty in becoming a writer was to dis- cover his own voice, once he found itt however, he was unable to accom- modate it in a fictional mode. Ultimately, he will be remembered not for the artistry of his work, but for his passion and moral authority. C Jacksont Jocelyn Eleanor Whitehead.

SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR: ENCOUNTERS WITH DEATH. Rutgers University Press, 1973.188 pp. $9. Simone de Beauvoir shares with other existentialist writers a preoccupation with death which, in Marks's opinion, amounts to an obsession. In analyzing this obsession, Marks distinguishes among the kinds of death about which de Beauvoir writes and discusses each kind separately; thus, we find chapters on the death of God, the death of others, deaths in fiction, and conjectures about her own death. Preceding the discussion of each topic is an excerpt from one of de Beauvoir's published and unpublished works which dem- onstrates the importance of the theme to be considered. And, since Marks has, in the first chapter, provided a large discussion of de Beauvoir's work and established the overall thematic importance of death, one cannot charge her with selective reading.

Reviewed by ENOCH BRATER, University of Pennsylvania As critics continue to give themselves headaches over Beckett's overtones, by accumulation we are swiftly gathering a body of secondary source ma- terial likely to rival those volumes mushrooming on Joyce, Faulkner, or T. S. Eliot. With the appearance of each new critical book we are also finding out something about Beckett himself, each biographical detail greeted as reverentially as though it were a fresh work itself. In Beckett we encounter, as the actress Madeleine Renaud pointed out some years ago, one of those exceptional men "for whom love and lucidity are on the same level." After 273</page><page sequence="10">SAMUEL BECKETT the bizarre right-wing fanaticism of Pound and the alternating anti-Semitism and Christian humanism of Eliot, it is indeed refreshing to discover in Beckett a literary giant on the active side of the liberal resistance: his experiences in World War II are an uncanny contradiction in the life of an artist who has made a career of sustaining so non-committal a profile. It is also a relief to be able to tell our students that not every twentieth century writer immortalized and anthologized in Norton is a fascist. Though he refused to sign the famous Manifeste des Cent Vingt-et-un, a document written by Sartre and signed by 121 intellectuals supporting the F. L. N. in Algeria, feeling that not being a French citizen made it morally im- possible for him to express any public opinion on this matter, Beckett's anti- Nazi activity in occupied France demonstrates no such moral punctilious- ness. Beckett said he worked against the Nazis because they were making life miserable for his friends, though it was hardly necessary for him to become a crucial link in an underground network to express his displeasure. Beckett used his linguistic expertise to translate documents captured from the Ger- mans concerning the movement of troops; after Beckett classified, typed, and prepared the material for microphotography, the papers were passed into the free zone and flown to Allied headquarters in London. In August 1942 two members of the resistance unit cracked under torture and gave names to the S. S.: Beckett was one of only 30 of the original band of 80 to survive the war. His friend Alfred Peron was not so lucky; he died a few days after being liberated from Mauthausen concentration camp. The jurist Paul Leon met a similar fate: he was carted away when he returned to Paris to rescue many valuables the Joyces had left behind in their apartment on the rue des Vignes. On November 28, 1941, he wrote from prison that one of his five wishes was to revise the French version of Ulysses with Beckett. He was murdered in the deportation of the French Jews. Beckett had earlier seen with his own eyes what was going on in Germany when he travelled there in the mid-Thirties. Lingering over the treasures in the German cathedrals and museums and visiting relatives in Kassel, he could witness as well the consequences of Hitler's rise to power when he met "decadent" painters, frequently jewish intellectuals, whose works had been removed from museums and who were forbidden to exhibit. He remembers the kindness of the art critic Willi Grohmann, who had recently been "relieved" of his position as one of the directors of the Zwinger Gallery, later bombed to fragments in the war. Beckett was also sensitive to outbreaks of anti-Semitism elsewhere in Europe: in November 1937 he returned to Dublin as witness in an anti-Semitic defamation trial against Oliver St. John Gogarty. Once established that he authored a banned book called More Pricks Than Kicks, Beckett's credibility as a witness was undermined by the press itself: one Dublin headline dismissed him quite summarily as THE ATHEIST FROM PARIS. The Gestapo might have been particularly excited about getting their hands on this left-wing, Jew-loving Beckett, the tall, lanky Irishman in tight- fitting French clothes carefully eluding them in Paris. Not only was he part of a subversive underground ring, he was, judging by fastidious Nazi genetic standards, no less than a Jew himself. Though part of the Protestant Irish mid- dle-class (brought up, as Beckett said, "almost a Quaker"), the family had, in part, a Jewish ancestry: "Bequet, Bequet," the hysterical spectator cries out 274</page><page sequence="11">in the unpublished and unperformed Eleutheria of 1947, "sa doit etre un juif groenlandais matine d'auvergnat.'t Hugh Kenner makes a convincing case for Beckett's experiences in World War II as a central consideration in his novels and plays: suspicion, spy net- works, torture, crawling in the mud, hiding in ditches, games to help pass the time, endless waiting. The observation is a shrewd one, for it relates Beckett's metaphysical preoccupations to foundations far less sidereal. When riding rampant on Beckett's Cartesian centaur it is sometimes tempting to forget those more immediately threatening monsters less elusive than Godot: in A Reader's Guide Kenner presents a contemporary Beckett with his feet planted firmly on territory familiar to readers of Kafka, Sartre, Camus, and, more recently, Solzhenitsyn. The historical perspective is not only political, but simultaneously literary. For Kenner sees Beckett as the representative writer of our time, just as Eliot filled that role for a previous generation of readers. We move from Eliot's Game of Chess to Beckett's endgame: though centers cannot hold, belle-lettrists may be alternately amused and horrified to discover that imagery still provides connectives. A Reader's Guide is also a persuasive demonstration of how to write a guide book: while never talking down to its audience, it provides quite simply the most valuable over-view of Beckett's work currently available. Undergraduates as well as Beckett specialists would be well-advised to look into it, for Kenner, a veteran of The Stoic Comedians and two editions of Samuel Beckett: A Critical Study, is a critic's critic. His work is never tainted by that sloppy sentimentality which frequently mars Beckett criticism: one reads Beckett, has an experience, then feels compelled to tell everybody about it. Sometimes the process takes place in reverse: one reads Beckett, fails to have that ultimate experience everybody else is gushing about, but still feels compelled to tell everybody about it. Though this may account in part for the proliferation of books on Beckett, in either case we get testimo- nials rather than criticism, Beckett as God or Beckett as Fraud. The liability, romantic though it is, is nonetheless self-indulgent. Kenner avoids it com- pletely. About the first ten pages into Back to Beckett is enough to convince even the most skeptical reader that Ruby Cohn's work is a sensitive contribution to Beckett scholarship. Though it begins with a Personal Foreword confessing, "I am writing this book to clarify my enthusiasm for Beckett, and I hope that it will interest people who are moved by Beckett's words," Cohn, fortunately, thinks as well as feels: and it is precisely in the discrimination of its perceptions that Back to Beckett excels. There is enough new information in Cohn's book to keep Beckett commentators busy for the next decade: anyone with fresh insights into Beckett should check Cohn in advance to make certain that she hasn't already scooped the story, if not here, then in her earlier study, Samuel Beckett, The Comic Gamut, or in the steady stream of essays written since 1956. Back to Beckett is, in fact, a condensation of Cohn's enormous range on this subject; though it includes a few items published elsewhere, it combines these with more recent explorations, par- ticularly illuminating in the compilation of production notes surrounding performances of the plays and Beckett's own role as director of his own pieces. Though Cohn tells us she wants neither footnotes nor index to en- cumber her argument, the one weakness of her book lies precisely in the 275</page><page sequence="12">SAMUEL BECKETT absence of these tools. The serious young scholar will want to go back to Cohn again and again; he will have to annotate the Princeton edition for himself if he wants to keep on top of things. The long chapter on Beckett's "Iyrics of fiction," those intensely elliptical fragments following the publication of How It Is, is a demonstration of sound scholarship and in- valuable source material: no where else has so much background in- formation concerning the genesis of these works been published. There is no serious examination which can now be written without footnoting Back to Beckett. Though the personal note may cloy, the professional tone is clear and commanding. Cohn has firmly established herself as one of the three or four superstars in the first generation of Beckett criticism. The short volume by Alvarez in the Modern Masters Series under the general editorship of Frank Kermode is hardly a match for the expertise of Ruby Cohn. Alvarez gleans some biographical material from Lawrence E. Harvey's Samuel Beckett, Poet and Critic: like Kenner, his rendition is, thank- fully, more chronologically arranged. Alvarez does to Beckett what F. R. Leavis did to Yeats in the Norton Lectures at Harvard some years ago; the savage God in Alvarez attempts to distinguish between masterpieces and lesser works, yet his lines are arbitrarily and idiosyncratically drawn. Opinions are stated as journalistic matters of fact: "if not for the plays, the novels would be read only by specialists." Beckett's late prose fragments are categorically "without syntax," Alvarez never considering the possibility that Beckett is attempting to evolve a hermetic syntax of his own here. When Alvarez doesn't like something, he says instead that it is simply no good, a dubious critical category embracing Watt, The (Jnnamable (dismissed as "the unreadable"), and Happy Days (which, in diametric opposite to Ruby Cohn, he finds"the least interesting" of the plays). Alvarez does have some interesting observations to share with us, but he is so obsessed with suicide and desolation row that he uses up most of the space allotted to him by Viking before he gets down to them. The late prose fragments can indeed be viewed as "a vision of some kind of Dantesque af- terlife"; we do want to know precisely what kind, but Alvarez keeps pushing Alvarez in front of Beckett. He congratulates himself in seeing Beckett's "self-suicided" work ending in the silence of Breath, but along comes Not I in 1972 to upset the equilibrium. Alvarez retrenches in an enthusiast-c After- thought clever, but not entirely convincing. Though his guide book ex- poses us to his own supple and imaginative mind, one takes shelter in Ken- ner's far more lucid arrangement of the same material. Porter Abbott's provocative study of form and effect in Beckett's fiction, volume 22 in Perspectives in Criticism published by University of California Press, owes its inspiration to Yvor Winters' concept of imitative form. Though this book is short, it is one of the soundest examinations of Beckett's search to achieve, in his own words, "a form to accommodate the mess." Abbott centers his attention on the crucial period between the composition of Watt (1944) and the publication of Texts for Nothing (1955), the years in which Beckett matured into a major writer of prose fiction in both French and English. When, on August 15, 1942, Mme. Peron warned him that the S.S. was on his track (a desperate telegram arrived, opened, at 11 a.m.: "Alfred arrete par Gestapo. Priere faire necessaire pour corriger lterreur"- he was gone by 3 p.m.), Beckett spent two anxious months in Paris, moving in and around the city from one apartment to another. Finally he made contact with a passeur 276</page><page sequence="13">and one October night was led cross-country with nine other refugees into Free France. From Vichy he moved on to Avignon and then to the tiny village of Rousillon, near Apt in the Vaucluse, where through friends he found a place to stay. In this Rhone village he worked for a man named Bonelli (men- tioned in En attendant Godot), receiving wine in exchange for his labors. He says that obtaining permission to glean in a field after a potato harvest was his chief triumph of the period. But it was during his evenings in Rousillon that he began writing Watt in English, a process he called a method of "staying sane" and a means "to get away from war and occupation." Though Beckett once called Watt only "a game" and "a joke," what John Fletcher later characterized as "a sort of extended doodle in words," Porter Abbott sees this as the beginning of a sustained exploration of the possi- bilities of imitative form in fiction: the experience of reading Watt closely re- sembles the experience the work is about. This is a perceptive basis for a dis- cussion of Beckett; in 1929, answering Rebecca West for her condescending review of Joyce's Work in Progress, the young Beckett already perceived that the embryonic Finnegans Wake was "not about something, it is that some- thing itself": "Here form is content, content is form." Abbott is both a graceful reader and an astute critic; never pushing his thesis, he lets the fiction itself illustrate his argument. This is the most important study of the formal aspects of Beckett's fiction since Edith Kern's brilliant analysis of Watt in Existential Thought and Fictional Technique. Eugene Webb's analysis of the plays, a companion piece to his book on the novels which precedes it, is a scholarly treatise on Beckett's relationship to the philosophical tradition of the absurd. Webb has an impeccable grasp of the gamut of Beckett scholarship; his i ncorporation of philosophical, biblical, and literary sources and analogues will provide endless delight for the Beckett enthusiast. Yet Webb's meticulous scholarship sometimes under- mines our appreciation of Beckett's plays as plays: we want to know more about the orchestration of stage business, one of the chief virtues of Beckett's craftsmanship and quite possibly his major contribution as a writer for the stage. The philosophical overtones are no substitute for that im- mediate visceral effect Beckett has on his audience: "I don't like to talk in- tellectually about a play which has to be played simply in order to be an in- tellectual play," he once reminded one of his interviewers, "I would like to talk about how you go to sleep or how you eat the carrots. The words are there. If they have meaning, the meaning will come out." In Beckett's plays the meaning, as in Chekhov, is as much between and underneath the words as in them: when directing Godot, for example, he urged his actors to practice a technique of "contrapuntal immobility," saying one thing while doing the reverse on stage. And in the plays since Godot stage directions begin to upstage the dialogue itself: the metaphysics is in the movement and in the theatricality itself. A distinction must also be drawn between Beckett's scripts for the theater and his scenarios for television, film, mime, and radio: when Beckett designs something for a particular medium, it is impossible for it to slip into another medium without losing much of its original animation. There is no question, as Webb carefully demonstrates, that Beckett brings to his plays an elaborately intellectual and frequently academic framework; but, as Kenner points out, this is not Eliot or Pound: allusions "pass with often sardonic fe- licity, deepening our pleasure when we recognize them, troubling no sur- 277</page><page sequence="14">SAMUEL BECKETT face when we do not .... a form that expects no learning in the audience, only a willingness to accept (to laugh at) the bareness of what is barely offered." Webb is at his best when he points out that the "bareness" in Beckett's minimal dramatic art is not an absence of meanings and connec- tions, but rather a condensation of complexities the same point Beckett himself made in his M.A. thesis on Proust at Trinity in 1931: the artistic process is not an expansion, but a contraction. It is not impossible to write a good book on Beckett, only agonizingly difficult. Marcel Duchamp speaks of a work's loss of aroma, which turns it into an object of study. Beckett, of course, has made a valiant attempt to retain his artistic freshness and to remain critic-proof. Molloy's ingenious recycling of TLS is really Beckett's definitive noli me tangere: . . . in winter, under my greatcoat, I wrapped myself in swathes of newspaper, and did not shed them until the earth awoke, for good, in April. The Times Literary Supplement was admirably adapted to this purpose, of a never-failing toughness and impermeability. Even farts made no impression on it. But literary critics have been very busy catching up with the Nobel Beckett (his own quip at Yeats), hoping to snare the essence of his achievement as conscientiously as Jacques Moran stalked Molloy. Poor Beckett!- so much an establishment figure that a negative reaction is already mobilizing its ranks in certain chique academic circles his days are surely numbered. C Estess, Ted Lynn.

Since no solid critical volume on Blasco appears in any language, this work represents a pioneering effort. The task was made especially difficult because it entailed reading some sixty volumes in the original Spanish. The authors want to correct the impression that Blasco is simply the author of early exam- ples of regional realism who became the greedy manufacturer of best sellers. The first two chapters describe Blasco's adventurous career and the later chapters concentrate on his development as artist and craftsman, his theory of literature and methods of composition, and they suggest the relevance he has for modern readers.

JOYCE CARY A Echeruo, Michael. JOYCE CARY AND THE NOVEL OF AFRICA. Afrgcana Pub- lishing, 1973.156 pp. S10 The author places Joyce Cary's African novels within a tradition of European novels about Africa a tradition which records the reality of African life only as it is subsumed within the author's moral and philosophical preconcep- tions. Joyce Cary began to write within this tradition, but gradually moved from a utilitarian political philosophy to a more idealistic and even existential one. However, since his sketches and drafts belong to his earlier African experience, he was not really able to accommodate this material with his new vision. The author examines the novels in the light of this compromise. M;tchell, Giles. THE ART THEME IN JOYCE CARY'S FIRST TRILOGY. Mouton, 1971.136 pp. $6.25. Noble, R. W. JOYCE CARY.

CHESTERTON A Barker, Dudley. G. K. CHESTERTON: A BiOGRAPHY. Stein and Day, 1973. 304 pp. $8.95. This is the best over-all book on Chesterton that we have seen. Perhaps this is because, in contrast to most others who have writtern on G. K. C., Dudley Barker recognizes that Chesterton was a writer who never ascended to the top rank. In Barker's judgment, Chesterton devoted most of his life"to propaganda for Christianity," and the evidence provided by Chesterton's writings corroborates this view. Barker also puts his finger on the probable causes of his subject's greater success as an essayist than as a short-story writer. The biographer rightly points out in this regard thatt "except for his Father Brown stories, they are fictional essays." Barker furthermore writes percipiently about Chesterton's "decrescendos." Yet Barker's biography can hardly be termed unsympathetic. He is good, for example, at pointing to the kind of levity and commonsense that G. K. C. was capable of, as in the commentaries on the debate with Shaw and on Chesterton's remarks concerning his Chaucer. The reader who consults Maisie Ward's 1944 volume on Chesterton in tandem with this one by Barker will get a very well-balanced sense of Chesterton the man and Chesterton the writer. The biblicography at the end lists Chesterton's published books. And as if to make the volume even more of a bargain for the G. K. C. devotee, there are a number of interesting snap- shots of Chesterton and companions. 288</page><page sequence="25">E Derus, David L. "Chesterton as Literary Critic."

THE LIFE OF IVY COMPTON-BURNETT. Braziller, 1973.192 pp. $7.95. Reviewed by GERALD WEALES, University of Pennsy1vania "Have you ever thought of writing an autobiography?" asks Kay Dick, in the Ivy section of Ivy &amp; Stevie, and Compton-Burnett answers, "No, I think there'd be so much I wouldn't want to reveal." The revelations, when and if they come, will have to be supplied by biographers who will have their work cut out for them because, as Compton-Burnett says, "I haven't been at all deedy," and in larger part because a mischievousness in the novelist, as Dick warns, caused her to be "rather tricky in her confidences," supplying "contradictory versions of the same personal incident to different people." Dick's book pretends to be neither biography nor criticism (given its length, it should not pretend to be a book either). It consists of an interview with Compton-Burnett ("Talking to Ivy") and a memoir-rumination about her ("Thinking about Ivy"), coupled with a similar interview-essay com- 290</page><page sequence="27">bination about Stevie Smith. "Thinking" is a shapeless piece that contains an affectionate picture of Kay Dick's friend, the titular Ivy, a few facts, some in- teresting generalizations on Compton-Burnett, and a vivid description of the novelist's funeral. "Talking" is the edited version of a rather random con- versation which Dick taped in 1963. It touches on Compton-Burnett's re- ligious beliefs or lack of them, her sense of morality, her ideas about writing, and, somewhat obliquely, her non-deedy life. It is valuable almost by ac- cident, when a stray phrase or idea rises out of the conversational context and seems to elucidate the novels. An example that I particularly like comes when Dick is trying to discover what Compton-Burnett defines as sin. "Self- deception? I don't think there is such a thing," the novelist says, and adds, "When people say they do things unconsciously and subconsciously, I am quite sure they do them consciously." At least as far back as P. C. Kennedy's review of Pastors and Masters (New Statesman, June 20, 1925), critics have been fascinated by Compton-Burnett's skill at inflicting "unconscious self- revelation" on her characters, and an occasional line suggests that Compton- Burnett accepts that reading (" 'And the will is not among his clothes or in any of the cupboards,' said Miss Patmore, unconsciously throwing light on her own character" Brothers and Sisters). Yet, I assume that Compton-Bur- nett's characters go in for conscious revelation, try to tell as much as they can about themselves without giving that impression to their listeners; for that reason, the remarks on self-deception read, to me, like a clue consciously given, of course to the construction of her dialogue. 'l don't mean things like sex experiences," says Compton-Burnett, ex- plaining those autobiographical details she would be reluctant to reveal. "I mean the sort of things that might sound exceedingly trivial." She goes on to say that "if I wrote an autobiography, a really good one, and put myself into it . . . I think I should do it very well." She probably would have, too, had she been able to keep her customary aesthetic distance, for her novels testify to her ability to invest the apparently commonplace with both malevolence and comedy. Elizabeth Sprigge has no such talent. The Life of Ivy Compton-Bur- nett is all triviality and no revelation. One can open the book to almost any page and find information like this: In 1953 at Dr. Pasmore's instigation, Ivy, who was greatly interested in the history of Kensington, became a founder member of the Kensington Society. Another event early in this year which she enjoyed was the marriage of Luke Marsden- Smedley to Marygold Lansdell. or this: Lady Waechter (Molly) was another friend who took a great interest in embroi- dery. She was a large, rather untidy Irish woman, a contrast with the neatness of her hostesses and the dandyism of Ernest Thesiger. Marygold Lansdell and Lady Waechter (Molly) make no other appearances in the biography, but a great many barely visible people tromp in and out, usually at tea-time, and anyone reading Sprigge's book might want to make up a list of characters as she suggests that Compton-Burnett's own readers should do to help them get through her novels. Sprigge reduces a major novelist to a silly ass and occasionally turns an ap- parently likable women into a petty, snobbish, grasping voyeuristic old hor- ror. When Sprigge quotes Roger Kidd's recollection of Compton-Burnett's 291</page><page sequence="28">IVY COMPTON-BURNETT bending over wild flowers and saying, "Oh, you darlings!" the novelist seems as harmless as a Margaret Rutherford character, but there is less charm to her when we see her listening with pleasure to an obscene phone call, becoming distressed at coats tossed casually about, snubbing an actor at a radio rehearsal because he is in shirt sleeves, complaining in 1930, despite her com- fortable income, "I am ashamed to be so poor." Treated properly, any of these things might help us understand how Compton-Burnett could make artistic use of her own impossible qualities, but Sprigge writes "as a friend" when Compton-Burnett's life and work cry out for the attention of a per- ceptive stranger. Or, at least, of a friend who can say matter-of-factly, as Kay Dick does, that Compton-Burnett was "Totally unable to comprehend the existence of social strata below her," that "It was not so much that she was in- sular as that she was typically a product of the social environment that had produced her, living still, for all practical purposes, in the era of her child- hood and youth." Of course, Compton-Burnett said much the same things about herself in the celebrated conversation with Margaret Jourdain which she prepared for Orion (1945). To be fair to Sprigge's book, the opening chapters do contain useful in- formation on Compton-Burnett's early life, on the double family, like the ones that so often turned up in her novels, and on the catalogue of early deaths, suicides, and nervous breakdowns which seem so much a part of the comfortable middle-class England of the late Victorian and Edwardian years (note Quentin Bell's Virginia Woolf) and which obviously left their mark on Compton-Burnett and her work. There are also a number of sensible remarks about the novels, usually cluoted from reviews, but for the most part the best things in Sprigge's book are smothered by her fascination with the in- significant. The greatest shortcomings of the biography are the failure to ac- count for the fourteen-year silence between Dolores (1911) and Pastors and Masters (in the Dick interview, Compton-Burnett blames family duties, ill- health, and the first world war) and the refusal or the inability to deal with the implications of the relationship of Compton-Burnett and Margaret Jour- dain. I am willing to accept that these "best friends" (Sprigge puts the quotation marks around the phrase) were "neuters," Compton-Burnett's own label, but the matter can hardly be so easily dismissed in a work that constantly underlines the sexuality particularly the homosexuality of the novels. A startling example of the biographer's pitfall about which Kay Dick warns can be found early in Cicely Greig's Ivy Compton-Burnett, in which the author mislays two of Compton-Burnett's sisters. Whether she got her ma- terial from published sources or casual conversations with her subject, Greig reports that "Ivy ... had two younger brothers and two sisters." As Kay Dick's interview indicates, the novelist was willing to talk about her dead brothers, but she was apparently reluctant to mention the two sisters who committed suicide in 1916. Greig might well have avoided both error and biographical detail since her book, "a memoir," is intended as "a portrait of the late Dame Ivy Compton-Burnett as I knew her during twenty-four years." She seems not to have known the novelist well, at least until her last years, and to have seen her infrequently. Greig, whom Sprigge describes as "a well- read young woman who taught English at an evening institute, wrote love stories and did a certain amount of typing," wrote to Compton-Burnett shortly after World War II, expressing admiration for her work and asking to 292</page><page sequence="29">be allowed to type one of her manuscripts; beginning with Manservant and Maidservant, Greig typed all the Compton-Burnett novels that followed. A relationship that began as a purely professional one developed into a per- sonal one over the years. The attractive thing about the book is that Greig conveys her sense of awe at the formidable woman whom she admired and her usually repressed desire to tease the "period piece" who seemed so relentlessly cut off from the contemporary world. The unattractive side of Compton-Burnett, so clear in Sprigge, is here smothered in indulgence: Greig sounds like an under- standing child protecting a confused adult. The useful thing about the book is that Greig scatters comments on Compton-Burnett's writing techniques through still another installment of ladies-magazine gush about Compton- Burnett's world and her ways. Greig quotes a letter, written in 1968, in which Compton-Burnett comments on the popularity of diaries and biographies: "A novel is more difficult to read, as its parts are related." It is ironic that these three women, all admirers of their subject, should have so little sense of structure, should skip happily from item to item as though they did not understand that Compton-Burnett's own abrupt jumps the lapses of time between paragraphs-are only apparent breaks in the development of plot, theme, mood. "No writer was ever so completely of her books, and her books of her," Anthony Powell wrote in his obituary of Compton-Burnett for Spectator, implying that an understanding of the novels is a necessary approach to the woman. Charles Burkhart says much the same thing at the beginning of the essay he includes in his collection The Art of 1. Compton-Burnett when he suggests that the shape of the life can be found in the pattern of the oeuvre. For those of us who never sat at the Compton-Burnett tea-table, those for whom the work is the reality of the woman, the emphasis would have to be slightly different. A well-written biography of Compton-Burnett particu- larly of her early years might be interesting in its own right, but the details of her life are primarily important for what they contribute to our reading of the novels. It is the perceptive critic who will finally tell us more about Compton-Burnett than the journeyman biographer. The Compton-Burnett criticism consists largely of reviews and generalizing essays with only occa- sional attempts at extended studies of individual novels. There have been longer works, of course the Pamela Hansford Johnson pamphlet, the books by Robert Liddell, Frank Baldanza, Charles Burkhart but even these tend toward a synthesis of that abstraction, the Compton-Burnett novel, and treat the distinctive works in too few pages. Now, two new volumes have been added to the body of Compton-Burnett criticism without bringing much fresh understanding. The Art of 1. Compton-Burnett is not meant to be new; it is simply a first collection of existing pieces about the novelist. Since it is meant to be "com- memorative as well as critical," as Burkhart says in his introduction, it is hardly surprising that the quality is mixed, that the contributors' names are sometimes weightier than what they have to say. Still, there is enough good material in the book to make it useful to anyone interested in the novelist. It reprints the Orion conversation and the Michael Miligate interview from Review of English Literature (1962). It contains two fine reviews by Elizabeth Bowen, valuable not simply for what they say about Compton-Burnett, but as examples of the best of reviewing in two modes; Bowen takes a concen- 293</page><page sequence="30">IVY COMPTON-BURNETT trated look at Parents and Children in one of them and in the other considers Elders and Betters in the context of an excellent discussion of Victorian and Edwardian fiction. Here, too, is Robert Liddell's important early consideration of Compton-Burnett from A Treatise on the Novel (1947) and a number of authors who make interesting points John Preston on language, Edward Sackville-West on the Gaskell connection. On the other hand, there is a Raymond Mortimer notice of A House and Its Head which is an almost perfect example of that trying kind of review so often found in the English Sunday papers, one that drops so many names that the work under consideration disappears into the display of erudition put on by the re- viewer; and there is a Mario Praz piece, all familiar generalization and classy allusion, that might have served its original purpose-an introductory lecture on Italian radio but can add nothing but Mario Praz's name to this volume. These two contributions are symptomatic of an unfortunate tendency among Compton-Burnett critics "to bandy great names so freely," as Angus Wilson puts it in an essay in which he admits to a deal of bandying on his own part, but in which he also asks some important questions about Compton-Bur- nett's work and suggests that there are limiting rigidities in some of the stan- dard approaches to her novels-the Greek-tragedy analogy, for instance, and the tyrant-victim categorizations. A com pendium, my desk dictionary says, is "a su mmary or abstract containing the essential information in a brief form"-a definition that makes me suspect that Violet Powell chose the wrong word for her title, A Compton-Burnett Compendium. Hers is a summary of the inessential in- formation. Aside from one chapter on the typical Compton-Burnett setting, Powell's book consists of twenty chapters, each of which attempts to describe what happens in a single novel. It suggests the Lambs's Tales from Shakespeare, without style, or an outline series put together by someone who took Compton-Burnett's comments on plot ("But I think it is better for a novel to have a plot," she says in Orion) at face value and assumed that what happens in the novels is what happens in the novels. Anyone coming fresh on Violet Powell's Compton-Burnett might assume that she was a realistic novelist of English family life, an assumption that is strengthened when Powell goes to great lengths to explain away the coincidences in Darkness and Dayo as though plot were something other than a literary device. There are a few sentences for instance, her remark that "the likeness and essential difference between the two brothers" in A Family and a Fortune "weaves the pattern of this book"-which suggest ways of approaching the novels other than the relentless catalogue of incident that she regularly uses. The blandness of her prose is occasionally broken by a lurid image ("The guillo- tine of the First World War had cut short the life of her most loved brothertl; "she snatches her knowledge of the family secrets like a pistol from a holster, and fires in all directions"), but until the reader is prepared for such out- breaks, a phrase like "descends like Zeus from Olympus," describing Mr. Herrick's arrival at morning prayers in Pastors and Masters, might make one suspect that Powell is going to attempt a critical point about the discussion of the nature of God that runs all through the novel. That, however, is exactly- the kind of consideration that finds no place in this Compendium. Whatever limited value the book might have as a readers' guide through the compli- cated plots and mass of characters which confuse some Compton-Burnett admirers is weakened by the fact that the volume, unlike a good outline, is 294</page><page sequence="31">not designed as a ready reference to remind readers which character com- mits which crime in which novel. The obituary that Angus Wilson wrote for the Observer (both it and Anthony Powell's are reprinted in The Art of. . .) ends with these sensible words: "The first task required of serious critics is now that they rescue her from her cultists and proclaim the universality of her best books loudly and clearly to all."

JOSEPH CONRAD A Sherry, Norman, ed. CONRAD: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973.394 pp. $18.50. Unlike books in Twentieth Century Views or similar series, those in The Critical Heritage Series trace an author's contemporary reputation largely through reviews of his works in chronological order, thus providing the worthwhile service of gathering together a large number of critical responses which would otherwise be difficult to locate. A large percentage of unsigned reviews from obscure newspapers are included among the 157 selections in the Conrad volume, but though Editor Sherry afivoids including full-scale essays readily available elsewhere, he does a good job of showing how Conrad's better-known fellow writers reacted to his books from Almayer's Folly to Suspense. As in previous volumes in this important series, there is an unusually full index which includes references to the main characters and themes of Conrad. B Price, Antony.

DANIEL CORKERY A Saul, George Brandon. DANIEL CORKERY. Irish Writers Series. Bucknell Uni- versity Press, 1973.70 pp. $4.50. In fewer than fifty pages of text, Daniel Corkery is trussed and roasted. This book provides a list of Corkery's writings with occasional plot summaries, but with no effort at interpretation. Despite Saul's prefatory statement that it 297</page><page sequence="34">DANIEL CORKERY would be "primarily concerned with Corkery's nontractarian creative work in English," the greatest space is devoted to his nonfiction, including a whole chapter (one of four) beating the dead horse of Synge and Anglo-lrish Literature. The discussions of Corkery's short stories are mainly quoted or paraphrased from Saul's previous study, Rushlight Heritage. Eschewing analysis, Saul offers only evaluation he hails the short stories for being "gentle" and emotional, castigates the essays for being ungentle and emo- tional; he notes that the prose of The Threshold of Quiet is "spattered with unnecessary exclamation points," while A Munster Twilight is laudably "quite without the smell of the lamp." What he finds both praise and blame for in Corkery are all faults in Saul's own work, particularly the lack of the lamp's taint. The book contains a brief chronology and bibliography; there is no index. E Saul, George Brandon, Introduction. "Daniel Corkery's 'Fohnam the Sculptor.'

HART CRANE A Paul, Sherman. HART'S BRIDGE. University of Illinois Press, 1973. 316 pp. $10. Reviewed byJEROME MAZZAR O, State University of New York at Buffalo Wallace Stevens complained repeatedly of William Carlos Williams' view of poetry as a plastic art and Sherman Paul's Hart's Bridge shows that Stevens may well have extended the complaint to Hart Crane. In the first major study of the poet since John Unterecker's Voyager (1969), Paul indicates that Crane shared in Williams' and ultimately cubism's sense that an art work was not representational but itself an independent vital part of nature. In so doing, Paul relies upon his vast readings in nineteenth and twentieth century 298</page><page sequence="35">American literature, relating Crane not only to writers like Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau, but also to such figures of the twenties as T. S. Eliot, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Carlos Williams, Alfred Stieglitz, Waldo Frank, and Paul Rosenfeld. Paul's ability to handle art movements as well as to give intimate and detailed readings of Crane's major poems allows him to avoid the usual tendency of Crane critics to let rhetoric and adjectives both do the work of proof and assert moral approval or condemnation. Gone is the vocabulary of "seduction" and "dazzlement," of Crane as "magus" and "shadow figure." Gone, too, is the implicit "justification" in spite or because of Crane's ho- mosexuality. In their place, Paul uses a rhetoric of revery derived in part from traditional biographical criticism but also in part from Gaston Bachelard and phenomenology. Paul sees Crane's work as an obsessional pattern of the poet's trying to recreate an Edenic world he lost as a child and to move on through art to create a new "natural" Eden. These backward and forward countermove- ments exist in the midst of a present that is ever dissolving either into nos- talgia or into a Yeatsian golden nightingale. The aeolian harp is Crane's re- current image for the singing of his created paradises as the Isle of Pines or the Caribbean colors the images of his remembered bliss. Paul insists on Crane's awareness of Freud's admonitions against returns to childhood, and he shows how even present bliss and intensity are foredoomed in the erotic passages of "Voyages." The book begins with readings of such early poems as "Porphyro in Akron" (1921), "The Bridge of Estador" (1921), "In Shadow" (1917), and "The Moth That God Made Blind" (1915) and moves chronologi- cally through the poet's career, devoting its largest discussions to such major efforts as "For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen" and "Voyages" from White Buildings (1926) and The Bridge (1930). Paul does little with the poems published after The Bridge except to acknowledge the excellence of "The Broken Tower" and to suggest that the breakdown of Crane's personal life in Mexico was contingent upon an inability to do again what he had in The Bridge, to turn himself into a "natural," singing golden bird. The conclusion Paul reaches is not that much different from how other critics have explained the poet's suicide, but the depth of handling and new terms of the statement make Hart's Bridge a fine and useful study of Crane. Paul has broken down many of the rhetorical barriers that had beset Crane criticism and, one hopes, indicates a new phase in writing on the poet. But one might also argue that Paul has not quite fairly dealt with the problem of either Crane's original reception or the industrial nature of Paul's own predisposition. First, given the view of mimesis which the study propounds for Crane, Paul has not been considerate enough of the needs of human be- ings. Crane did not have an outlet for his view in life and life's disintegration as had Williams. The perfection of man in and through art does not account for the writer's having to go on. Just as the explorers of Williams' In the American Grain had to go on discovering, the writer- no matter how perfected he may feel by the completion of any particular work must go on living. When his energy gives out, what then? If art is his only life, he has be- come "lifeless." For this reason, the moral criticism of Yvor Winters, Allen Tate, and R. P. Blackmur must be looked at a little more seriously than Hart's Bridge wants to, for implicit in their objections is the suggestion not that only moral 299</page><page sequence="36">HART CRANE people can write great poetry, but that if poetry does not lead to constructive behavior then the writer, and perhaps his public, may disintegrate. Nor has Paul really seen through his own inclination to treat the sources of the poems much as industry treats raw material. Most of the book dwells on the poor materials that Crane was to rework poetically into such richness, as if his ability to create or recycle products was being valued over the actual products and their uses. The inclination has resulted throughout the book in an overpraise of Crane's ingenuity. One does not get distinguished clearly enough, for example, the good and bad sections of The Bridge; all are equally inventive in dealing with their raw materials. Still, in this study such matters pale against the book's real achievement: the perception of why Crane's work has drawn such violent support and opposition. Its dynamics of nostalgia and liberation through labor is central to the American imagination, regardless of how one might feel individually about Crane's claim that the dynamics lie beyond sexuality and perhaps even morality. Hart's Bridge depicts this challenge with great care and clinical detachment and never falls into sentimentality to either cloud issues or gain support. C Wolf, Jack Clifford.

The 400 pages devoted to writing about Crane offer thousands of critical and biographical items in year-by-year order, most of the references followed by generous extracts or annotation.

Edward Dowden's silent refusal to support the Irish literary Renaissance has been rather a puzzle, but Ludwigson's analysis of the critic's ideas reveals that this refusal is perfectly consistent with the entire body of Dowden's thought. This study accomplishes the difficult task of extracting from many disparate critical statements a coherent and systematic critical phi losophy. This philosophy has its roots in the organicism of Wordsworth's and Coleridge's theories, and it embraces the positivism of later nineteenth-century science. Dowden emerges from this analysis as a critic who has much to offer modern readers and one who has much in common with contemporary structuralists. ERNEST DOWSON E Cohen, Philip K.

Salzman recognizes that people seize upon literary legends eagerly and part with them reluctantly. A few legends, some originating with Dreiser himself, have surrounded the critical reception of Dreiser's works: that no copies of his first novel were sold because Mrs. Doubleday was so outraged by it that she caused it to be withdrawn from circulation; that reviews of Sister Carrie were universally unfavorable. Salzman believes that whatever the legends 306 </page><page sequence="43">satisfy for people, they cannot serve as the basis of serious scholarship, and he has gathered the reviews which explode these myths and demonstrate that from the beginning some critics did recognize Dreiser's genius. All of the reviews, which span the whole of Dreiser's career, 1900-1947, provide for the Dreiser scholar an adequate basis for determining the critical opinion of the time. Each of Dreiser's works comprises a separate section, and reviews which are not reproduced are listed following each section. Except for the British reviews of Sister Carrie, which were important in Dreiser's career, only American reviews are included here. These American reviews are drawn not only from major newspapers, but from representative periodicals across the country. While the editor does include a short index of the few critics who can be identified, the scholar might better appreciate an index of pe- riodicals. Such an index would help to reveal, among other things, whether or not any regional considerations affected Dreiser's reception. Also, some annotation of allusions, now obscure, would be helpful.

TO HEAVEN AND BACK: THE NEW MORALITY IN THE PLAYS OF FRIEDRICH DURRENMATT. The University Press of Kentucky, 1972.70 pp. $6. Reviewed by CHARLES H. HELMETAG, Villanova University Kurt J. Fickert has long been interested in the question of morality in Durren- matt's dramas. In the introduction to his book To Heaven and Back he describes Durrenmatt's dramatic oeuvre as a quest for a new morality, a quest which moves increasingly closer to the"contemporary relativistic theory of ethics." The so-called "new morality" would replace the traditional moral codes with a single guide to moral conduct, "the commandment of love," that is, "a willingness to allow consideration for others . . . to be the sole basis for action." Durrenmatt's aborted plan to write a trilogy on the 308</page><page sequence="45">tower of Babel is proof, in Fickert's view, of the dramatist's basic concern with "man's grotesque attempt to reach heaven (total good) and the ensuing disillusionment, which leads . . . to an understanding of man's relationship to God and the actual nature of morality." The tension between human justice and God's forgiving grace is seen as an ever-recurring theme. In the nine chapters which make up the body of the book, Fickert takes up ten plays, from Es steht geschrieben to Der Meteor. In Romulus der Grosse he contrasts the hero's stubborn belief in a pre-established moral order with the German general Odoaker, who in sparing Romulus represents the prin- ciple of mercy and love rather than justice. Die Ehe des Herrn Mississippi marks the first step toward establishing this principle as the "key to ethical behavior." In Ein Engel kommt nach Babylon everyone but the beggar Akki is too self-righteous and legalistically oriented to accept the gift of God's grace. Like Akki, III, Mobius, Augias, and Schwitter eventually achieve insight into the true relationship between God and man. In the case of the latter three heroes, Fickert speaks of their "descent from a self-made tower of Babel, a rationalistic structure of morality" to finally "accept God's mercy waiting below." In Fickert's interpretation, Die Ehe des Herrn Mississippi is the turning point and the key work in Durrenmatt's dramatic oeuvre. Florestan Mississippi is one in a long line of proponents of legalism in Durrenmatt's plays, while his opponent Ubelohe represents moral behavior based on love "without reference to rules of conduct." Reared to live by pre-established standards, like Mississippi, "Durrenmatt must find life problematical in the modern world, where convictions are largely replaced by doubt." He re- solves the dilemma in the figure of Ubelohe and his 8'new morality." Fickert supports his argument with quotations from Joseph Fletcher, John Robinson, Reinhold Niebuhr, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and Durrenmatt himself. Most of the standard works on the dramatist are cited as well, although the bibliog- raphy omits a number of studies on the problem of faith and morality in Dur- renmatt (for example, see the articles by Diller [German Quarterly, XL; Monatshefte, LXIII] and Holzapfel [Modern Drama, Xlil]). Fickert's position is interesting and frequently on the mark (although it leads him into occasional oversimplification and inaccuracy). He succeeds in demonstrating the presence of morality, tragedy, courage, and hope in the great majority of Durrenmatt's plays, but the Durrenmatt morality portrayed here, in my opinion, more closely resembles a liberalized modification of the Protestant ethic than an espousal of situation ethics. One wonders whether the author might not have provided further insights and perhaps strengthened his argument if he had expanded the chapters more pertinent to his thesis rather than treated ten dramas of varying importance in the rigid format of ten short chapters. Apart from suggesting a possible key to the meaning of Durrenmatt's work, the book also sheds light on the role of the paradoxical and the dramatist's use of symbolic names. C Badanes, Leslie.

Yale University Press, 1973. 304 pp. $12.50. Reviewed byJOSEPH F. TRIMMER, Ball State University According to a recent survey of the research interests of the members of the Modern Language Association, only Shakespeare, Chaucer, and Milton can claim more scholarly attention than William Faulkner. Unfortunately, this in- terest has not produced, at least in the last few years, scholarship of memorable quality. Michael Miligate's comments in the 1971 American Literary Scholarship annual summarize the situation succinctly: "The trouble with so many items is that we simply do not need them: they add little or nothing to our knowledge of Faulkner or to our prospects of appreciating him more fully, and they all too often appear to be written in total disregard of the last decade or so of Faulkner criticism and all of Faulkner scholarship." Unhappily, the books by Edwin R. Hunter and Joseph W. Reed, Jr. illustrate the validity of Miligate's complaint. Both books ignore not only most pre- vious Faulkner scholarship, but also the extensive scholarship available on the subject of narration. This latter omission is, in some ways, the more serious since it results in a trivialization of the subject on the one hand- Hu nter's discussion of "narrative practice" is little more than an identification of narrative voice and the problems presented by Faulkner's use of italics or an obfuscation of the subject on the other Reed's dis- cussion of the various roles of Teller and Hearer, though occasionally insightful, is marred by vague or impressionistic terminology and an incon- sistent critical methodology. Hunter introduces the two subjects of his book by asserting that each of Faulkner's novels "is in some way an experiment." What this statement means and where it may lead need not detain us for it is not recalled again: the book proceeds on its merry way without the limitations of an informing thesis. The first section, "narrative practice," deals with subjects such as the time shifts in the Benjy and Quentin sections, a list of the stories Faulkner has reused in the novels, and a listing of something called "Authorial En- thusiasms" we are told that Faulkner is romantic about the woods and is good "in the field of character creation." The second section, "prose style," is of more benefit even though it operates in apparent ignorance of the contributions to the subject made by critics such as Slatoff, Zink, and Beck. Much of this section is devoted to the making of lists and the presentation of illustrative quotations. There are chapters on "clustering," the "retained dis- card" (a concept coined by Hunter but often difficult to distinguish from clustering), negative formation, sentence length, and imagery. The difficulty with these discussions is that the list-making and the obsession with counting "there are at least 105 notable metaphors in the Faulkner novels" never leads anywhere. Occasionally Hunter senses that his lists de- mand some general assessment of the development of Faulkner's style, but he is really too preoccupied by the numbers game to make thorough state- ments on style, much less on how style relates to meaning. Reed's opening and closing chapters focus on the material printed in Lion in the Garden to demonstrate that Faulkner was torn between two warring theories of art and, hence, two opposing images of the artist the "natural" story teller, whose characters would take over the tale, and the calculating ar- 314</page><page sequence="51">tisan, who wanted to shape the urn. The thesis of the book, revealed in the last chapter, is that Faulkner's novels document a search for an "ideal com- promise between these two contributive elements." While these opening and closing chapters are coherent and reasonable, the middle chapters, where the demonstration of this developmental process is supposed to take place, are without a consistent argument or methodology. In a review in the November 1973 American Literatureo Hyatt H. Waggoner objected to Reedis methodology because"its only concern is with Faulkner's devices, tech- niques and 'tricks' 't without regard to meaning. My objection, at least at one level, is that there is too little consistent focus on or adequate definition of narrative techniques Often a discussion which is ostensibly about narrative technique will shift into a discussion of image patterns or theme without the slightest indication of a change in gears. By the end of the study, the meaning of the term @'narrative" has become like St. Augustine's definition of God a circle whose center is everywhere and its circumference nowhere. Such criticism should be qualified by acknowledging that many of Reed's indi- vidual insights are very rewarding. But even the most engaging, those on Ab- salom, Absa10m! or the Snopes's trilogy for example, would be substantially strengthened by a more rigorous definition of terminology and by some ac- knowledgement of or dialogue with previous Faulkner scholarship. Happily, the books by Bleikasten and Pitavy illustrate that Faulkner criticism can be both responsible to previous scholarship and original in insight and interpretation. These two books were originally published as one (in French) with an introduction written by Michael Gresset; the book was reviewed quite favorably by Miligate in the 1970 American Literary Scholar- ship. Now translated into English and appearing as two separate paperbacks, the books provide one possible model for fruitful Faulkner scholarship. Frustrated by both the survey of the canon approach, which has rarely yielded much since Brooks, Vickery, and Miligate, and the limited focus ap- proach of the articles in the journals, Bleikasten argues for a series of studies of individual novels. Bleikasten and Pitavy's studies follow a similar though not identical plan. Each discusses subjects such as the genesis of the manuscript, language and style, theme, character, landscape or setting, and concludes with a chapter on the novel's critical reception. Each book ap- pends a useful bibliography which is cogently annotated and which also in- clu des articles written in French. While both books certainly provide a reliable and sensible synthesis of extant criticism, they are more than mere critical introductions; each offers many interesting and original insights which increase, incrementally if not substantially, our appreciation of the two novels. P;tavy's book on Light in August,, which may be the better of the two, makes good use of the manuscripts at both the University of Virginia and the University of Texas to arrive at a rather intriguing discussion of Faulkner's thematic use of verb tenses in the novel. His discussion of the novelts landscapes is equally insightful, though he is hard-pressed, it seems to me, to prove that J ligh- tower's final vision is redemptive. To inform his excellent discussion of characterization in As I Lay Dyings Bleikasten makes good use of Wright Mor- ris' essay on Faulkner's expressionism and of Sartre's theories of subjectivity and objectivity. Both of these studies are valuable contributions to Faulkner criticism; they are worthy of com mendation and emu lation. 315</page><page sequence="52">WILLIAM FAULKNER Leary, Lewis.

RONALD FIRBANK A Brophy, Brigid PRANCING NOVELIST: A DEFENCE OF FICTION IN THE FORM OF A CRITICAL BIOGRAPHY IN PRAISE OF RONALD FIRBANK. Barnes and Noble, 1973.592 pp. $20. Reviewed by ROBER T MURRAY DAVIS, University of Oklahoma Given the title and the fact that Brophy often writes and reasons like a rein- carnation of Mabel Dodge Luhan, the most annoying thing about this book is that no single aspect is entirely worthless. Her opening arguments, which defend the primacy of art over mimesis in fiction and the virtues of classical form and extol Firbank as modern exemplar of that form, are certainly de- fensible. But to rest the first two points on the third is to revise literary history in a way that many Firbankians would reject and to make Firbank's very real artistic achievement assume an intolerable burden. 320 </page><page sequence="57">The middle of the book is a "critical biography" only in the sense that Brophy uses many biographical details to interpret the novels. Except for some identifications and her discovery of facts about the history of Firbank's early milieu, she adds little to our knowledge of Firbank's external life. Markedly original, however, is her psychological interpretation of this ma- terial to illuminate Firbank's motives for writing-basically, his sense of exile from the Edwardian domestic paradise, The Coopers at Chiselhurst and his psychic involvement with his novels. Less happily, the psychological ap- proach also leads her to free association, to hit-or-miss interpretation (espe- cially of the significance of characters' names), and to baroque flights of speculation-as-fact, as in her views that Ronald's sister Heather had repeated affairs with chauffeurs, rather than the single one provable, and that Ronald secretly desired to be called Annesley. The conduct and apparatus of Brophy's research in the first three-fourths of the book is even more erratic than her interpretations. The manic cross- referencing between and within chapters is at first irritating; when the references turn out, as they almost invariably do, to be mere conjecture to support conjecture or simple restatement of an assertion, they are in- furiating. Secondary sources are handled roughly and uncritically at the same time. For example, Brophy has read Miriam J. Benkovitz's A Bibliography of Ronald Firbank and Rohald Firbank: A Biography to find a number of incon- sistencies, but in many cases these books are her only source of information even when primary sources are available. Thus Brophy could travel to the Loire valley to check on Firbank's impressions as recorded in Odette, but she did not bother to check even photocopies of The Artificial Princess manuscripts at the Berg Collection, though these contain not only whatever correctives the Benkovitz descriptions require but also material crucial to her argument about Firbank's development as an artist. On the other hand, she traces carefully the Sappho references in Vainglory and has compared variant states of the novels. Even then, she cites the "Mussolini" reading in Part II, Chapter Vl of Inclinations as if it were from the first rather than the first collected edition, and she appears to have read only the portions of reviews quoted in advertisements of the novels. Consistently excellent if sometimes forced, however, is her discovery and use of information about the Second Empire religious and social atmosphere of Chiselhurst to support vividly and convincingly her case for the area's importance to Firbank's imaginative de- velopment. Only in her analysis of narrative technique and structure, aided by a knowledge of painting and music more adeptly used than in previous Firbank criticism, does Brophy largely escape the forced and frenetic com- paresons and speculations, the pointless footnoting, and the curious lapses of scholarly and critical tact. Her discussions of musical structure in Vainglory and The Flower Beneath the Foot are obviously correct, genuinely illu- minating, and capable of being extended to Firbank's other works. Those who wish to discover a new approach to Firbank's fictional method should skip to part four, which contains these and other critical analyses. Despite the intermittent but real insights in the first three parts, none but the hardiest and most tolerant reader is advised to attempt the whole.

Twentieth Century American Writers. Thomas Y. Crowell, 1973.178 pp. $4.50. Although writing ostensibly for younger students rather than for scholars, Fahey nevertheless presents a well-written if somewhat catchy introduction to Fitzgerald. His thesis is that the American dream is not measured merely by gaining material success but also by gaining the women who embody that success. Thus Ginevra King, Fitzgerald's first lost love, is as important to the short stories and early novels as is Zelda to the later works, for each in her own right contributed to the sense of doom and failure in Fitzgerald's work as each represented the presumably unattainable goal which is ultimately not worth the attainment. The bittersweet character of Fitzgerald's works therefore is caused by both the losing and the winning of the "golden girl," for in both instances failure or success- there is a final disillusionment and destruction as the Fitzgerald hero realizes that what she stood for is illusory and meaningless.

Two series of short stories which Fitzgeraid wrote for the Saturday Evening Post in the late 1920s and early 1930s are here brought together for the first time. The Basil Duke Lee Stories appear to be about Fitzgerald's own life as an adolescentJ while those dealing with Josephine Perry offer a feminine counterpart. In their Introduction, Bryer and Kuehl point out that Fitzgerald felt that if the two series were read together, they would ha\/e the effect of a single novel. . F.

H. Lawrence, Desmond MacCarthy, Rose Macaulay, Rebecca West, and Lytton Strachey. Included also are a number of reviews which appeared in provincial newspapers. Gardner includes not only published reviews, but also private journal entries; thus, we are invited to compare Katherine Mansfield's public praise of Howard's End with her privately written remark that " 'E. M. Forster never gets any further than warming the teapot.'" The collection possesses a certain entertainment value, and, more important, enables us to trace the general changes in Forster's reputation. C Finkelstein, Bonnie Blumenthal.

The political turmoil of that region and the polarization between the Catholic and Protestant communities affect profoundly the content of Friel's work, the sort of audience he consciously addresses, and the way in which he defines himself as artist and citizen. Maxwell devotes necessary and considerable space to summarizing the main events of the Civil Rights campaign since 1968; he does, however, avoid discussing the 1922 settlement which would place these events in some perspective. He in- dicates Friel's response to the political situation and most important his stance toward calls for social activism. In dealing with the literature itself, Maxwell discusses Friel's fiction and plays in some detail, always observing the way in which Friel stands somewhat to the side of the Irish literary mainstream and frequently demonstrating the way in which his peculiar experience renders this separateness inevitable.

KIRSCHKE Elaine Barry's Robert Frost, one of Ungar's new Modern Literature Monographs, is a stimulating and thoughtful study which aligns Frost with 8Xthe great tradition of New England writers . . . who penetrated the dark un- dersurface of American life." Professor Barry provides generally satisfying in- terpretations of most of the several dozen Frost poems she discusses (evi- dence of her intimate familiarity with the poet's substantial canon), but mis- reads a few "The Subverted Flower" worst of all. Her remarks on Frost's concern for "sound," "tune," and poetic structure are very percipient; the comparison of Frost and William James truly splendid. This book slender though it is-is well worth the price. Robert Frost is surely one of the most quoted (and quotable) of Modern American poets. Within the past decade separate book-length studies by Daniel Smythe, Louis Mertins, and Robert Francis have dealt with Frost pri- marily as conversationalist. Peter ]. Stanlis has recently done more specialized (yet not less valuable) work, using Frost's quotations as a basis for illustrating the poet's attitudes towards politics. In Robert Frost on Writing Barry extends this method of treatment to include a generous selection of those of Frost's letters, prefaces, reviews, interviews, lectures, and parodies that bear upon 327</page><page sequence="64">ROBERT FROST the writer's craft. There was great need for a book on this subject; Frost's critical remarks on poetry, in particular, are among thewisest of any poet's in the twentieth century. We tip our hat to the man who provides us, for example, with this comment on poetic metre: '81 like to drag and break the intonation across the metre as waves first comb and break stumbling on the shingle." Many of Frost's best observations on writing, moreover, have been heretofore virtually inaccessible to the general reader. In this book Barry publishes many of Frost's valuable, but difficult to obtain (or previously unpublished) observations on the writer's craft. In addition, her 53-page in- troductory essay on Frost's criticism is most commendable. We do not feel, however, that Frost's "strong sense of competitiveness" is nearly so atypical a trait as Barry would lead us to believe. The best of the Modern writers have been either fiercely competitive or so proud that they admitted to having had no competitors among their contemporaries. We suspect that, to the greatest writers of any generation, the idea of "the shock of recognition'/ is a notion that has had little meaning. C Butler, David Warren.

University of lNew Mexico Press, 1972. 206 pp. $8.95. Reviewed by ANNETTE S. LE VITT Federico Garcia Lorca's life and art centered on Andalusian Spain, the towns of Granada, Cordoba, and Seville and the surrounding countryside, the ten- sions between a passionate people and a puritanical moral code which typify Catholic Spain. Throughout his poetry and plays we see imagery of the land, the desperate need for water, the overwhelming concern with fruitfulness in man as in nature, and-especially in the poetry-the presence of the gypsy as embodiment of the sensual, primitive side of mar1, unhampered by the restrictions of society's morality. Only the child is as natural and as free as the gypsy in Lorca's work. These concerns have naturally dominated the work of Lorca's critics, who, whether they approach his art from the standpoint of its provincial origins or apply more formalistic criteria for analysis, too frequently are impeded by the details of his biography, be it his death at the hands of Franco's falangists, his involvement with Salvadore Dali, or his year-long sojourn in New York. Thus we find most criticism of Lorca's work taken up either with his Spanish themes or with his psyche. INleedless to say, the work itself often recedes into the background. Rupert C. Allen pays close attention to the text in his study, The Symbolic World of Federico Garcia Lorca. His angle of vision is that of the psycho- mythic critic; he pursues this Jungian approach with relentless dedication, at times putting us off with logical leaps and pretentious jargon, but for the most part revealing a profundity of understanding which enlightens not only the works at hand, but Lorca's entire canon. Allen has chosen a mere five poems and one play on which to focus his analysis, but in the course of his discussion he alludes to numerous other Lorca works as they, too, reveal the particular patterns he is exploring. He has selected well, for the poems he discusses range from the early and localized Gypsy Ballads to the posthumous Poet in New York. The one play he considers (in an extremely close textual reading) is the quite atypical As Soon as Five Years Pass. According to Allen's plan, each chapter centers on one work and serves a distinct purpose; some, however, do less than their titles indicate. [n theory, chapters one and two (on "Preciosa and the Wind" and "Cicada!" respec- tively) present "the mythic perspective of the microcosm" and that of the "macrocosm." Unfortunately, chapter two is so dense and illogical a presentation ("the cicada [is] a chthonic Christ figure . . . the embodiment of sun; . . . the cicada, as such, is clearly not assimilable to the Christ figure, but libido is.") that it fails to convey a comprehensible interpretation on the mythic or any other level. Similarly, the so-called "esthetic perspective" of chapter three ("Girl Drowned in the Well: Granada and Newberg," from Poet in New York) differs little from the"psychological perspective" of chapter four (As Soon as Five Years Pass); the perspective is "esthetic" only because Allen interprets the drowned girl as Lorca's repressed creativity a conclusion, moreover, more projected onto the poem than drawn from it. 330</page><page sequence="67">(Lorca's stay in New York brings out the psychoanalytic even in Allen, who otherwise rejects the Freudian approach; to him, New York was so much the villain that it seems at times to replace the falangists as the cause of Lorca's death ) My final cavil with Allen's organization lies in the inadequacy of his treatment (in chapters five and six) of "the archetypal symbols of Lorca": "child, the promise of man's continued renewal," and "oceant the womb of all life,'t as seen in the poems "Narcissus" and "Fable." Surprisingly, these crucial images inspire from Allen few of the learned and sensitive allusions found in previous chapters. !ndeed, the concluding chapter, which purports to deal with "ocean," is merely a limited discussion of two of the mythic crea- tions of ocean, or the creative unconscious-the cyclops and unicorn of "Fable.'t Meaning blurs entirely, moreover, as Allen identifies these crea- tures with Lorca's stay in and departure from New York, and thus with his "illness" and cure. He adopts here, then, the very psychoanalytic approach which he explicitly denies-and so the book ends on a rather flat and discor- dant note. Despite these limitations, Allen provides an insight to Lorca which is both broader, in its Jungian overview, and more detailed, in its New Critical con- cern with text, than that of previous critics. At his best, he is undeniably effective in accomplishing his dual goal: "to set forth the meaning and spirit of an extraordinary symbolic world" and "to attempt a demonstration . . . of the substantial relationship between poetry and modern symbology." He is most convincing in the two chapters which apply most stringently the in- trinsic elements of Jungian literary criticism: those revealing the mythic structure of "Preciosatt and the psychological depth of Five Years. Allen describes Preciosa as "the individual overwhelmed by the imperious de- mands of Mother Earth, who will not tolerate virginity and who floods her consciousness with the drive toward defloration.... The girl finds herself precariously fieeing on the threshold, and threatening to fall into the uncon- scious- - . .t He has carefully laid the groundwork for this interpretation by explaining the mythic origins and psychological implications not only of such universal images as moon, wind, seashore, and sword, but of those as well with particularly Spanish-gypsy connotations which can now be under- stood in Jungian terms. Thus Lorca presents Preciosa's tambourine as a J@moon of parchment," and Allen explains that @'in connection with the com- pound woman-moon-tambourine symbolism . . . maternity is generally held to constitute the Gypsy woman's supreme value and . . . the moon plays an important role in her fertility spells." Similarly, St. Christopher, Lorca's em- bodiment of the wind, is "frequently depicted on the walls of Spanish churches as a gigantic figure . . . traditionally a hulking, primitive rustic, who appears here as a lascivious male figure towering over the protagonist...." These elements-male and female/ sexual and religious coalesce as Allen reminds us that "Christopher" literally means "Christ-bearer" and that this function also applies to the Virgin Mary, @'who was impregnated by the spirit or pneuma of God." Since pneuma and wind are equated in myth, Allen can conclude that "Preciosa herself is a virgin whose own unconscious reveals it- self to her in the form of a Christ-bearer . . . projected as a lascivious attack upon her person." More thoroughly than we can see in an excerpt, Allen has traced each image to its mythic source and conveyed its psychological im- plications; he has built to conclusions which seem almost obvious-so well has he prepared us. 331</page><page sequence="68">FEDERICO GARCIA LORCA The method is similarly thorough in Five Years, although here psychological elements dominate the fewer mythic references. Allen analyzes dramatic action, characterization, even sets and props, with the same care he gives each image in "Preciosa." He offers profound insights into the Young Man, protagonist of Five Years, who "has glimpsed the possi- bility of creating a self an inner life based on contact with the creative un- conscious; and (like all of us) as he passes through adolescence ('five years') finds himself drifting farther and farther away from his source, the great feminine unconscious, the Magna Mater in whose bosom the little child experiences reality." Allen's concern for detail is seen especially in his regard for the nuances of Lorca's language, attested to further by the subtleties of his translations of the poems: he is quite literal and at the same time evocative of Lorca's ambigui- ties. Indeed, it is his openness to ambiguity which permits Allen to surpass previous Lorca critics in the profundity and richness of his interpretations. In contrast to the flat, allegorical, psychoanalytical equations of Carl Cobb, for example, who describes the characters of Five Years by such statements as "Time [is] represented by the Old Man. The Stenographer, who is reality ...," Allen offers level upon level of possibility and explains that "Lorca recognized symbols for what they are: general indicators of unconscious tendencies, capable of accommodating any number of specific forms." He further suggests that "all attempts which have been made so far to deal psychologically with the poetry and drama of Lorca have been ineffectual- because they rest on a crude and inadequate distinction between a 'con- scious' mind and a 'subconscious' mind." We may not agree with Allen's preference for the Jungian approach to Lorca. It is difficult, however, to read this dense and sometimes irritating book without feeling that Allen has finally validated what Arturo Berea sug- gested as early as 1949: that Lorca was not "a poet of local color. He had used his dream-gypsies as an objectivized link between the concrete world his senses grasped and the visionary world of his mind that he expressed in his symbols." Through Allen's sensitive reading, we can now see Lorca's images of water, of gypsy, of child not simply as revelations of his national and psy- chic origins, but as links to the broader and deeper bases of all human thought and feeling. Allen has made us newly aware of the unconscious, of its ancient collective origins, and most importantly, of its presence, thematically and imagistically, throughout Lorca's canon. It is possible now for us to go back even to his earliest published book of poems (Libro de Poemas, 1921) andtotracethepsycho-mythicpatternswhich Allen has ex- posed. In just a few of these early poems we can now discern the links be- tween child and poet, the unconscious so much closer to the child, the stress on primeval creatures and flowing water as origins in time and space of that creative force. Thus we may see first the childlike directness and fantasy with which the "Old Lizard" is presented as "one drop of crocodile" and "dragon of the frogs"; however, when "Ideas, gondolas without oars, / cross the shadowy / waters of [his] burnt-out eyes," we understand for the first time that dragon and crocodile are early allusions to the primeval origins of both creatures and ideas. In "Ballad of the Little Square" it is the children who lead the poet to reveal his symbols of passionate death ("A rose of blood / and a white lily") and imaginative life ("I go in search of magicians / and of 332</page><page sequence="69">princesses!") and to recognize their sources in "The fountain and the stream of the antique song." In this poem, as in "Ballad of the Water of the Sea," Lorca indicates the ultimate source of his creativity, that collective uncon- scious to which we are so close as children ("the soul I had / of old, when I was a child, / ripened with legends"), and from which we are often so re- mote as adults ("The sea / smiles from far off. / Teeth of foam, lips of sky." Such connections would not have been possible without Allen, for he has taught us to read Lorca with new vision. One hopes that he himself will read further with us. C Burton, Julianne.

Lady Gregory is usually viewed as the supporting player in the cast of the Ab- bey Theatre: W. B. Yeat's patron or J. M. Synge's sponsor. Hazard Adams does here an admirable job of presenting Gregory as a playwright worthy to be studied on her own merits. The initial chapter, "Her Career," is too superficial to be useful for biography, but as Adams points out, such in- formation is available elsewhere. The other three chapters classify Gregory's works into "Mythological History," the cycle of plays centering around the fictive village society of Cloon, and those folktales and children's plays dealing with the supernatural. Adams provides provocative thematic analyses of the plays, as well as simple plot-summaries; he credits Gregory with psychological insight and narrative realism that enable her audience to bet- ter understand the quality of Kiltartan Irish. A bibliography and brief chronology are provided, but there is no index. FREDERICK PHILIP GROVE A Stobie, Margaret R. FREDERICK PHILIP GROVE. Twayne World Authors Series, No. 246. Twayne, 1973.206 pp. $5.50. In her study of Grove's writing career, Stobie makes use of unpublished ma- terials recently made available in the Grove Collection at Manitoba. Since lit- tle is known about Grove's early life, she limits her discussion to the years be- tween 1913 and 1948. She emphasizes the importance of nineteenth-century educational philosophy both upon Grove's teaching and his writing. In dis- cussing the novels, Stobie mentions the life experience out of which the novel emerges, summarizes the plot, and discusses briefly the themes and images. Persistent themes which she locates are the changing generations and shifting cultural epochs, themes which she believes originate with the great visions of nineteenth-century science. One might wish that she had concentrated more upon Grove's thought and thereby made the study deeper than it is. 337</page><page sequence="74">FREDERICK PHILIP GROVE E Keith, W. J. "F. P.

This massive work contains 3,153 entries of material written on Hardy be- tween 1871 and 1969, including reviews, general appreciations, bibliogra- phies, biographies, critical books, documented articles, chapters in books, references to Hardy in books and articles, Ph.D. dissertations, letters to the editors of major newspapers and journals, introductions to editions of Hardy's works, and explications in anthologies and casebooks. These entries are not confined to material written in English, but embrace eleven lan- guages. The editors provide five indices: authors, scholarly works, pe- riodicals and newspapers, foreign language studies, and primary titles. The abstracts supplied for almost every entry are perhaps the most impressive feature of this work. The writers have attempted to duplicate the style of the individual critic, and the results, especially in the case of nineteenth-century entries, are often quite charming. Largely because of the abstracts, this bib- liography is an invaluable reference guide. Halliday, F. E. THOMAS HARDY: HIS LIFE AND WORK. Barnes and Noble, 1972. 206 pp. $11.50.

Florence Henniker, the daughter of Richard Monckton Milnes, has for a long time been a shadowy figure in Thomas Hardy's life, one who undoubtedly influenced strongly the writer's emotional life and possibly his creative life as well. These letters permit us some insight into what this charming and ac- complished woman meant to Hardy the man, but what she meant to him as an artist remains elusive. Yet aside from questions of biography or influence, the letters are valuable for Hardy's comments on literary figures of his time, 339</page><page sequence="76">THOMAS HARDY both major and minor. The collection includes prefaces by each of the edi- tors, that by F. W. Pinion being the more speculative of the two. The letters, extremely well annotated and indexed, are followed by a short essay on Mrs. Henniker written by Hardy and published anonymously and by a list of the volumes of novels and short stories published by Mrs. Henniker.

Columbia University Press, 1972.222 pp. $10. R eviewed by JANE EAR L Y That Hardy's depiction of the countryside which he knew so well continues to preoccupy scholars is shown by these books. Two writers could scarcely direct themselves, however, to the subject from such different perspectives than do Denys Kay-Robinson and Merryn Williams. In Hardy's Wessex Reap- praised Kay-Robinson identifies the actual places depicted and renamed by Hardy, and he describes these places both as they appeared when Hardy wrote and when people visit them now. Since only one who knows the Wessex area as well as the author does could question the accuracy of Kay- Robinson's identifications, we must assume that the work is done as competently as it appears to be. We do not really learn anything new about Hardy from this study, but rather have thoroughly confirmed for us that Hardy's art was rooted in the actual. The author devotes separate sections to various districts of Wessex and brings in those works of Hardy which are rele- vant. Such an arrangement is certainly sensible and makes the book particu- larly useful for the tourist. But the book does not really appear to be ad- dressed to the tourist; for he would not need the wealth of descriptive details which the author provides. Nor would this study inspire anyone to go to Wessex, so u nimaginatively is the material presented. This lack of imagination is reflected by the author's efforts to prove that Hardy invented nothing and saw everything, even when houses or churches still existing in- dicate invention on Hardy's part. Moreover, Kay-Robinson seems to believe that by piling up descriptive details, he will enable the reader to visualizethe Wessex landscape and buildings, but such an achievement demands a prose style far more compelling than the author possesses. The unrelieved flatness of paragraphs [ike the following would quickly tire all but the most fanatical admirer of Hardy: The main entrance to the park [Kingston Maurward] is still through gates beside a lodge, but bronze bitterns no longer perch on the piers. The drive, now tarred, crosses grounds that fully match Hardy's description. The northern part of the park is Kingston Maurward Eweleaze, the roadside fringe of which is now oc- cupied by a group of workers' cottages. Near the house there are one or two pre- fabricated buildings, discreetly sited. In Thomas Hardy and Rural England Merryn Williams attempts a new di- rection in Hardy criticism. She is concerned with relating Hardy's novels to the society in which they are set and with exploding some long-held myths 340</page><page sequence="77">about this society. She produces abundant evidence that rural life was never an Arcadia and that the "real caluses of rural depopulation and suffering" re- sulted not from Free Trade or industrialism, but were inherent in a social system "which included illiteracy and illegitimacy; starvation wages, unem- ployment, exploitation and fear." Whatever faults Williams' study possesses, it is fresh and provocative. The flaws are, however, numerous. The most serious is the lack of integration. It is not until the middle that the author deals with the novels at all. She spends half of the book providing "back- ground," which itself does not hold together well. For example in the second chapter she mentions William Howitt's perception that there were "two nations" in England. One should be reminded of Disraeli's Sybil and indeed much other nineteenth-century writing. But Williams does not men- tion Disraeli until Chapter 4 when she laboriously devotes a small section to him and to other writers of "country novels." Also, in these early sectionsw the author draws much information from extremely minor figures like Char- lotte Elizabeth Tonna when similar facts could be taken from major novelists, thereby eliminating the numerous and tedious plot summaries. Also, quite arbitrarily, Williams does not consider any writing before 1840, and while one realizes that limits must be set, a certain historical myopia results. For example, one should not, as the author does, discuss the "myth" of the simple virtues and happiness of rura} life without at least referring to Wordsworth. Probably the entire study should have been organized thematically, the novels and social history then integrated with discussion of various themes. As it iSf we find one whole chapter devoted to one theme- seduction. Why not dispossession or migration? When we finally arrive at discussion of the novels, we must feel as though we have reached the main feature after patiently submitting to docu- mentaries and previews of coming attractions. But our patience is unre- warded. Williams insults us with a section in which she takes each novel and summarizes the occupations and general social and economic status of each of the characters, as though we do not know already that Diggory Venn is a reddleman or that Jude scares birds in his youth. The criticism which follows often is unrelated to the issue at hand and usually is pedestrian or worse. Oc- casionally, though, the author makes an interesting point. In Tess much has been made of the threshing machine "which has come from outside to shat- ter the traditional rhythms of agricultural life." "Yet,' Williams objectst "it is difficult to see how this work is any crueller than reed-drawings or grubbing up swedes in the pitiless rain. Industrialism can certainly be brutal, but then so can nature (remember the dying birds)." Merryn Williams offers a provocative thesis; it is too bad she did not write a better book.

Southern Illinois University Press, 1973. 246 pp. $8.95. Kvam, Wayne E. HEMINGWAY IN GERMANY. Ohio University Press, 1973. 214 pp. $8.50. Reviewed by LINDA W. WAGNER, Michigan State University These three books illustrate well the wide range of Hemingway criticism possible in the mid-1970s. Wayne Kvam's Hemingway in Germany is a useful book to anyone interested in just that, the way Hemingway has been received (Kvam treats post-World War II to the present) and is received in Germany a limited audience at best. Bakker's study is badly out-of-date and therefore of little value, although the book is the first critical study of Hem- ingway published by a Netherlands publisher. Sheldon Grebstein's Hem- ingway's Craft is a useful, easy book. The trio proves that there is no need to declare a moratorium on Hemingway criticism, that there is still much to be said and done. What it does prove is that publishers need to be a bit more careful about their tendency to publish in areas that are "not covered" yet (nice as it is to know about Germany and the Netherlands, two more Grebstein-like studies would have been of inestimably more value). Grebstein's major premise is that too little real attention has been paid to the ways Hemingway has achieved his fictional effects. More difficult to handle than following several pervasive themes, this premise leads him to discuss all the works on a relatively fragmented basis. He begins with the structures of first the short stories and then the novels; then he discusses point of view, dialogue, syntax, language rhythms and sounds, and the use of detail. He concludes with a chapter on Hemingway's humor. In several of these areas, Grebstein works chronologically; therefore we begin at the be- ginning and proceed to Islands in the Stream several times. To his credit is the fact that Grebstein has tried to choose different stories and different sec- tions of the novels, to vary his commentary as much as possible. In the chapters on structure, Grebstein describes Hemingway's charac- teristic pattern as being of an inward-outward-inward or a journey motif- from small units (like framing one indoor scene with outside ones) to the plan for entire novels, like For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and 345</page><page sequence="82">The Sea. Grebstein considers locating such patterns significant for "the very structure or pattern of Hemingway's stories comprises a form of thought, perhaps for the artist the most cogent kind: form as thought." Grebstein finds Hemingway's use of point of view less interesting than some other narrative devices, although he does point out that unreliability of the "I-witness" (as in "Fifty Grand," "Mother of a Queen," and The Sun Also Rises) is crucial to any understanding of Hemingway's intention. Grebstein is at his best discussing Hemingway's use of "presented" dia- logue, in its stark impact involving the reader just as poetry does, and the components of his "style." Of the effect of Hemingway's paragraphs, he writes, the power of Hemingway's sentences is cumulative, arising not so much from the single statement as from the progression or montage of sentences in the para- graph, and the corresponding progression of paragraphs. This is why Hem- ingway's style is so easy to imitate or parody one sentence at a time, but so difficult to reproduce in the large-or to excel. Punctuation, sentence rhythms, syntax, Hemingway's use of sensory experience, juxtaposition (within elements of the sentence and paragraph as well as of sections within the fiction) Grebstein usefully considers each of these areas. While there are many accurate insights in Hemingway's Craft, some chapters are less successful than others. Grebstein analyzes the journey pat- terns, but never expresses any feeling as to the wisdom of Hemingway's repeating that pattern (would he have been better off not to have relied on it so much, especially in To Have and Have Not? Would Cantwell have been a more sympathetic character at home, dying with his boots on, than journeying all over after ducks and Renata? Does Hemingway's regular use of the pattern bespeak a kind of imaginative poverty?) Grebstein does draw well-founded conclusions about Hemingway's language, but his chapter on narrative perspective remains inconclusive. Part of the difficulty with the study comes because his last chapter is more of an appendix than a con- clusion. "Hemingway's Humor" might better have been separate from the issue of craft because it evolves only very generally from what Grebstein considers the writer's "craft" to be, his control (in fact, Hemingway's most common humor appears in his least controlled, sloppiest writing). The book also includes summaries of the manuscript differences for A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls. J. Bakker, in Ernest Hemingway, The Artist as Man of Action, also discusses "style" but he uses the term loosely to relate more to Hemingway's life style than his writing style. Beginning with the Nick Adams stories, Bakker rephrases the "code" as exemplified by what he sees as the affirmative character of Nick. He traces this ideological system through the books he considers "failures" (Across the River and into The Trees, The Old Man and The Sea, and A Movable Feast). These later three he finds unsatisfactory be- cause of both the limitations of Hemingway's vision and his artistic methods. Since all of Bakker's arguments date from the state of criticism in the early- or mid-sixties, taking these arguments seriously is difficult. Many typographical errors and a heavy prose style compound the problem. Wayne Kvam's study of Hemingway's reception in Germany is well-writ- ten; points are made succinctly and the material is interesting. Kvam dis- 346 ERNEST HEMINGWAY</page><page sequence="83">cusses German reaction to American literature generally before he moves to Hemingway's particu lar attraction for German readers his image of "a modern primitive," or "a democratic proletarian Bryon," his writing evincing "a sense of fatality." Germans responded to him as "a fellow sufferer. Also they looked to Hemingway as a model for living; in spite of his personal set- backs and near brushes with death, he never allowed them to overcome his desire for a full, adventuresome life." German critics appreciated Hem- ingway's "darker" books like Across the River and into the Trees and The Old Man and the Sea and early recognized his kinship with existential philosophy. Perhaps Kvam's concluding sentence-summarizing the reasons for Hem- ingway's popularity in Germany-can paraphrase the conclusions of all three studies here briefly considered: that Hemingway "won the admiration" of reader and critic alike because of his "honesty, his expressed concern for truth, and his unconditional striving for his own artistic goals." The Artist as Man of Action was undeniably- right or wrong also The Artist as Man of Conviction. Broer, Lawrence R. HEMINGWAY'S SPANISH TRAGEDY. University of Alabama Press, 1973. 132 pp. $7.50.

The author quarrels with those who have attempted to classify the form of Huxley's works and to place them within a tradition. Unable to provide any useful alternative, he sees Huxley ultimately as sui generis. For the sake of convenience, he uses the term "novels of ideas," but warns that the term should not imply any lack of novelistic talent or any absence of feeling. May attempts to unite the structure of the novel with the meaning, believing that one illuminates the other. He considers the novels from Crome Yellow to Is- land, emphasizing Huxley's need to reconcile absolute and relative values, to find an orderly system which would include all of the elements which his analytical brain could distinguish, and finally to discover a means to com- mu nicate his ideas convincingly and engagingly. Thody, Philip. ALDOUS HUXLEY: A BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION. Leaders of Modern Thought. Scribner's, 1973. $5.95 cloth, $2.95 paperbound. Because the Leaders of Modern Thought series is devoted primarily to biographies of the great scientific and intellectual minds of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, men like Freud, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Sartre, Aldous Huxley's inclusion is a further example of how he, in a world which stresses the distinctions between the two culturest is able to encompass both the scientific and artistic communities. Thody's very readable introduction traces how three tragedies in Huxley's youth the almost total impairment of his vision, the loss of his mother to cancer, and the suicide of his older brother-led Huxley to a life of literature as a means of working out the ten- sions created by these events. Thus through his novels Huxley attempted to make sense of his existence, covering responses which began with the aesthetic and satiric, evolved into the humanistic, and finally culminated with the mystical. Thody's approach, obviously, stresses Huxley the thinker rather than Huxley the creative artist and reminds us how much his thought is part of his art. B Lash, Barry.

DAVID IGNATOW A Mills, Ralph J., Jr. ed. THE NOTEBOOKS OF DAVID IGNATOW. The Swallow Press, 1973.376 pp. $9.95. Reviewed by A. POULIN, JR., State University of New York at Brockport The Notebooks of David Ignatow amply demonstrates the truth of Roethke's claim that "the poet's business (is) to be more, not less, than a man." Moreover, it achieves a resonance which reveals that, while eschewing the theatrics of unacknowledged legislator of the poetry circuit, in addition to being a major voice in contemporary poetry David Ignatow has been pri- vately and quietly becoming a rare phenomenon in American letters. He has matured into a genuine poet-philosopher who succeeds in making of his fate an instance of all fate and who, as Emerson expected of a poet, "stands among partial men for the complete man, and apprises us not of his wealth, but of the common wealth." Edited intelligently and sensitively by Ralph Mills, The Notebooks of David Ignatow, then, is an equally rare example of a work which satisfies Kafka's dictum that a book should serve as an axe for the frozen sea within us. Clearly, Ignatow's Notebooks is not to be confused with diaries, confessions, or a gathering of brilliant images, metaphors, unfinished poems and aphorisms from a poet's workbook, although it includes characteristics of each. Rather, it is the intellectual, spiritual, artistic and philosophical auto- biography of a man obsessed by the need to know and by the more de- manding need to live with the raw truth of his existence and actions. "I want to be at the center of existence in my feeling and life," Ignatow asserts. "I want to touch the very nerve that pulsates with our being to feel it react to 353</page><page sequence="90">DAVID IGNATOW my touch as if I were handling my own heart. Anything less than that is irrele- vant as a reason for being." Despite his stated objective, however, Ignatow also realizes that especially in America "we don't dare live our lives as given us." Rather, we cling to the lips of a disintegrating Judaeo-Christian tradition and, ignoring the facts of history, desperately need to believe in that optimistic Whitmanesque faith in the essential goodness of the democratic average, his experiences and insti- tutions, in that phantom of the new Adam in the new world which continues to linger as the precariously thin American mythos. The Notebooks is now obviously an essential companion to Ignatow's collected poems published by Wesleyan University Press in 1970, since it offers a sustained insight into the evolving life out of which the poems emerged and the sensibility controlling them. But it is equally important as a self-contained document. Fully aware of those willed or imposed concentric layers of that self-protective ice of illusion and self-delusion that distort or destroy honest confrontation with one's self, Ignatow's chosen task is to hack his way through them to discover whatever gorgeous or monstrous human heart is beating underneath and to explore the currents and consequences of the pulse that drives a son, husband, father, and poet living in America during the past forty years. With an unflinching, sometimes unbearably painful integrity in his pursuit of truth as he sees it, Ignatow arrives at an understanding of his life to date as being profoundly tragic. And specifically because the Notebooks extends far beyond literary considerations and auto- biography, with an increasing strength of spirit, humanity, and wisdom Ignatow also points to the essential tragedy of the American mythos, espe- cially as shaped in part and voiced by Whitman. In his unswerving attempt to see existence as it really is, Ignatow constantly tests Whitman's vision and finds it incapable of surviving the facts. The earth which Whitman reverenced actually supplies us with neither a reason for life nor a moral lesson. And if we ask, "we receive the only reply earth is capable of, its mute presence and its forceful presence. A round ball, with no clue to beginning or end, with not even friction for our fingers which might tell us the difference between yes and no." Nor does life promise the hope or comfort of transcendence: "Our clothes and regular habits give us cover from eternity: a suction hole, the sky itself. Under the evil blue eye we are drawn toward its vast emptiness." The new world is not that edenic garden it was meant to be and its in- habitants satisfy neither de Crevecoeur's nor Whitman's anticipations. "My Father has many mansions," Ignatow writes, "but they were given the choice of the leftover lumber and so they built themselves stadiums and streets and parks to crack nuts in, to crack time, vacant upon vacancy, cancelled from sight.... Left with the wind and the poetic stars, they crack nuts on the street which they built to organize the emptiness, and laid out parks to flower the emptiness, and erected stadiums to play upon the emptiness. Given the whole world to roam in . . . they roam and make merry upon emptiness." In that emptiness "freedom is only for lunatics and fools't and love is "coated with a fine layer of dust from our factories. Dust on the tongue and eyelids and upon the hands that meet for love." The quality of life is de- termined by a money-madness, "a disease eating away life: emptiness growing like spoor upon the body. Soon, soon it will reach out of the heart and the brain and Pouf! you see transfigured into stone what was once a 354</page><page sequence="91">breathing man." The promises of those technological miracles have resulted in a total disintegration of personality by the pounding of machines to which men are enslaved. "Whatever protest has risen up in you against this regi- mentation falls down under the pounding and you like an automaton your- self now move ... as in a dream, a dream of the dead." Even as he sits hunched over the crystal set waiting /for the world to announce itself," the first words spoken by that rniracle of man's inventiveness are perversely ironic: "Buy Adam's Hats." Thus Ignatow concludes, "Whitman's America. It's Poe swinging by the neck from a subway strap." Ignatow realizes that at the core of the American tragedy is Whitman's faith in the essential goodness of man, his belief in the new Adam as a viable "mythophor" and the logical optimism arising out of such a premise. And while he can never fully escape Whitman's powerful presence, Ignatow does reject such a moral vision. Early in the Notebooks he posits his own, which is almost diametrically opposed to Whitman's: 8'Each generation discovers its own sin, but our discovery is attacked by an illness that demands we see ourselves in an image of man never before existing and perhaps never to exist, a state of perfection beyond the human. It seems necessary at this point, if we are to content ourselves with living, to accept the first requisite to living: that limitation is man's first characteristic." Later his disagreement is more open. "My idea of being a moral leader is to point out the terrible deficiencies in man. Whitman spent his life boosting the good side." Ignatow immediately asserts his own role: "My life will be spent pointing out the bad," and he adds that most crucial phrase "from the standpoint of for- giveness and peace rather than improvement...." As Ralph Mills notes in his lucid Introduction, in a 1951 entry Ignatow clearly summarizes the moral and existential stance which controls the Notebooks: "In our day we must unlearn our optimism.... We must see the other side which is a void, without love, without laughtert without mercy or adventure or beauty or ceremony." The toll for this kind of quest can be ter- rifying, the comfort minimal, the risk absolute. Ignatow realizes that. "Now man is completely free. Each man is entirely free and divorced from any overt influence on him.... We are free without knowing which way to turn for safety in our freedom and all turning and whirling and knocking one another down and getting up and quarreling and making a fight of it to the death." Gripped by this terrible freedom and steadily staring at that voidt at first Ignatow tentatively asks the only possible question. "I am reaching to the crucial question of the age. Why live?'t Later he is more assured: "When you come down to it, the problem is why live?" If Ignatow asserts that "the execution was pronounced in the womb" and that against all evidence he lives by choice, as he says in his poems, thereby approaching what Camus called the only truly philosophical problem as a re- sult of almost totally rejecting Whitman's optimism, he also rejects the ulti- mate despair of his tragic vision. While suicide is a possibility, it is also a total refusal to see and live life as it really is. Instead, Ignatow arrives at a hu- manistic stoicism. He writes, "once we have learned to deny, to disbelieve in our optimism, only by personal dedication may we ascend beyond this ter- ror. Then we may devote olurselves to love, to mercy, to understanding." Again, as he refuses Whitman's "chest-thumping," he asserts, "the highest good today and perhaps forever from now on is to council peace, for- giveness, patience, understandingt charity. Back to the Bible, forbearance, 355 </page><page sequence="92">DAVID IGNATOW fortitude, strength to endure and strength to be charitable." And faced with those terrible deficiencies in himself as well as in all men, with the fact that like himself others are also "bogged down in despair of themselves and of others and lived only to see time pass and events change and men grow old and die," he arrives at what seems to be the only truly human alternative to total despair: "Turn, then, to me with you arms wide and let us embrace in an anguish of mutual recognition and keep each other from falling down upon the ground in grief." The Notebooks of David lgnatow obviously isn't a philosophical tract. Dating back to 1934, it consists of a series of isolated entries which weren't originally written for publication and lack that sustained measure of wilfull mastery of raw materials one might expect from an artist and thinker. And even though they've been edited, they still often lack the polish of style, the systematic consistency of thought and emotion, and that glaze of self-pro- tective irony often present in a more pre-meditated medium. Many of the early entries are the awkward probings of a person teaching himself how to think and being a little self-conscious of the fact that he's writing to himself. Some entries reveal Ignatow engaging in self-indulgent rage against the de- mands of daily life, in unmitigated self-pity for not being able to indulge his love of leisure in order to have the freedom to write, or in those necessary moments of egocentricity that often enable an artist to survive and grow. Emotional and intellectual contradictions often unabashedly clash. However, it is to the credit of Mills and Ignatow that this edge of roughness to the Notebooks has been retained, for such are integral points on the graph of a human psyche: the poet or philosopher doesn't always live at that pitch of brilliant madness any more than anyone else. Moreover, the sense of the authenticity and integrity of the voice in these notebooks in part arises out of and is strengthened by this absence of intellectual and stylistic gloss. The authenticity and power of the Notebooks is further strengthened by the fact that Ignatow's broader considerations are deeply rooted in his own sense of himself, his life, and his experiences. In his attempt to see existence as it really is, without illusion or self-deception and "from the standpoint of forgiveness and peace," he begins and ends with himself. He is no adamic figure. In 1955 he writes: "My breath stinks, my armpits smell, my stomach aches. I am not what I thought I was." Almost twenty years later he says, "It seems I have a burial ground in me where I am placing the bodies of all the victims of the world." His view of the quality of life produced by technology emerges out of his many years spent as an employee and later as manager of his father's bindery. And during his long painful struggle with his father he accuses him: "To his mistaken wish for independence, my education, my opportunity to discover myself in some useful, joyful occupation was sacrificed." And yet he also sees his father as a "a man of humble fears whose pride and rages issue from his inner self-criticism and who is so despairing of genuine happiness and balance that photographs of nude men and women in copulation can be a drug for his bitterness." Ultimately, albeit perhaps too late, he is able to confront his relationship with his father with that measure of forgiveness and peace expressed in his poem "Epitaph": "Forgive me, father,/ as I have for- given you/ my sins." Undoubtedly the most painful passages in Ignatow's Notebooks, and those which most clear1y demonstrate his obsession with the truth at any cost, are 356</page><page sequence="93">those concerned with his son's mental illness. Shortly after the discovery of his son's illness, Ignatow lashes out: "My whole feeling is to leave this boy and be free of him. I want him out of my mind, I want to be free to write again." About a year later he writes, "I am living now to prove my innocence of any crime. I feel myself accused. What a humble bastard I turned out to be." Ten years later he asks, "Was poetry worth this child's decline into madness?" And finally he makes the most demanding declaration: "I com- mitted murder in full awareness of what I was doirig, with secret self-en- couragement a symbolic murder done upon a man child.... I am a murderer allowed to walk the streets, to raise another child, to teach other children, to stay married, to make my wife happy in every way possible. There is no law for such a crime as I have committed. I am my own punish- ment...." In 1951 Ignatow wrote, "My job shall always be to remind poets that there is a world outside, the more decisive world that yet must be treated tragically by us in the highest intensity and seriousness, though while it ignores us we must not run off into separate worlds of our own." In 1970 he looks back on his own work with that determination to escape all self-deception: "I have no illusions about myself as a poet. Whatever I do is for my own sake, it helps no one directly and helps no one indirectly in a substantial, qualitative way so as to reform their lives. What I do as a poet is a point of reference for others who are in my kind of dedication. They can look upon what I've done through the power of concentration and hope to make themselves eqally strong for the test upon themselves. The results are not assured, I do nothing there." In one of his entries Ignatow writes, "This is the feeling I have, that tomor- row may be my last day alive and that I might as well write in defiance of time and death. It's not that I want to leave an epitaph or a remembrance, but that it makes me angry to think I must meet an appointed day without an act of rebellion." In his poems David Ignatow has succeeded in creating repeated acts of rebellion for himself and his readers. Now his Notebooks is a powerful axe raised against the sea that has encircled and frozen around the heart of the American experience. EUGENE IONESCO A Lewis, Allan. EUGENE IONESCO.

KIRSCHKE It seems to me that some of the most interesting and discerning Jamesian criticism to have appeared over the past decade has dealt with the Master's relationship to France and to French writers. Of book length studies alone, the list is impressive: Bruce Lowery's Marcel Proust et HenryJames (1964), Al- berta Fabris' Henry James e la Francia (1969), Jeanne Delbaere-Garant's HenryJames: The Vision of France (1970), and Lyall Powerso HenryJames and the Naturalist Movement (1971 ) . Philip Grover's sensitively written Henry James and the French Novel: A Study in Inspiration deserves to be placed with the best of these volumes. Henry James and the French Novel considers the effect that James's fre- quent reading and re-reading of French novelists had on his development as a writer. Grover sensibly concedes the difficulty of comparing the styles of authors writing in different languages and makes no attempt to prove that James's fiction shows a stylistic dependence upon the French novelists. He nevertheless perceptively compares James's method with that of such French Realists as Balzac, Flaubert, Maupassant, Loti, and Zola. The author is also very suggestive in his handling of James and "L'Art pour l'Art" a subject about which not enough has been said. Grover concludes his succinct and cogent volume with an invaluable eighteen page "Chronology of James's Life and Works with Special Reference to French Literature." In Sensuous Pessimism Carl Maves interestingly (if somewhat cautiously) explores Henry James's double view of Italy: "as a venerable relic" and "as the sink of elegant vice and luxurious corruption." As Maves notes, this double vision remains throughout James's career, but, from 1877 a "sensuous pessimism" increasingly comes to surround "the Italy of appearances." There are many worthy aspects of this study, not the least of which is the author's ability to make comparisons that illuminate not only the works 358</page><page sequence="95">being compared, but also the Master's methods of working. This ability is perhaps best seen in those passages wherein Maves develops the notion that The Wings of the Dove is "a re-write" of The Portrait of a Lady. He is also par- ticularly good in showing how the use of Italy in "The Madonna of the Future" helps to make this tale one of James's more successful early stories. Sensuous Pessimism, too, includes a helpful chronological chart that "schematizes the connection between Henry James's various Italian so- journs 14 separate visits over a period of 38 years." By way of negative criticism, I have only two cavils: firstly, the author fails to allude to the periodical literature on his topic some of which is quite good. I think that R. L. Gale's seminal "Henry James and Italy" (Nineteenth Century Fiction, 1959), in particular, merits at least footnote reference in any treatment of the subject. Furthermore, Maves does not seem to be sufficiently bold in his remarks concerning some of the more often discussed novels, such as The Golden Bowl. In brief, Sensuous Pessimism is a generally successful if somewhat cautious treatment of a subject which, the author makes clear, was extremely fascinating to the Master over much of his long and distinguished career. "Cautious" is certainly not the word to describe Michael Egan's brief yet provocative HenryJames: The Ibsen Years. This volume represents the first of the "Vision Critical Studies," of which Egan himself is General Editor. If his example proves any indication of what is to come, the Vision Critical Studies should be anything but dull. Most of Egan's argument deals with what he sees to be Henry James's "gradual assimilation of Ibsen's symbotic manner." In keeping with his thesis, the author perceptively compares The Turn of the Screw with Ghosts and Rosmersholm, and The Wings of the Dove with Hedda Gabler and )ohn Gab- riel Borkman. In making these comparisons, Egan, who is also editor of The Critical Heritage volume on Ibsen (1972), establishes beyond doubt that Ibsen had a strong influence upon James. And in the course of doing this, the critic makes a shrewd and incisive case for Ibsen's having shown James "how to use Hawthorne." But there are a number of problems with this book. For example, Egan seems incorrect to imply that, prior to 1890, James's goals were"the faithful representation of contemporary reality within a literary frame." I do not think that the "Realist" definition adequately describes the best of James's early fiction. Egan moreover argues for the year 1895 as "the pivotal year in James's artistic evolution." He sees this year as crucial partially because it is the year of James's traumatic Guy Domville experience and partially because it is the year that James's admiration for Ibsen seemed to have reached its peak. Despite much contrary evidence, the author then states that, after 1895, James undergoes a "transition from the novelist as painter to the novelist as dramatist." In her wide-ranging Henry James and the Visual Arts (1972), Viola H. Winner draws numerous examples from the post-1895 period of James's use of his (by then) quite sophisticated visual sensibility as it mani- fests itself in the fiction My research on this "post-Guy Domville period" convinces me also that the late James was at least as much "the painter in words" as "the playwright in fiction." My most basic quarrel with Egan, however, is that his book commits the fallacy of the unique source. When the author implies that "James's complex technical process, in all the late novels, derives ultimately from Ibsen," he 359</page><page sequence="96">fails to take account of the multifarious influences-from literature and from the plastic arts on the novels of the so-called "Major Phase." By the time James came to write the late novels, he possessed an intimate knowledge of the literary and artistic heritage of the West, and he demonstrably drew upon the work of many artists, from many genres, in the making of his late novels. To imply that one author provided the key to the Major Phase of James's fiction is indeed a facile and specious way of handling a subject that is very complex. But while James perhaps became more interested in the dramatic method after about 1890, he showed, from the outset, a fascination with the theme of money and its effect on his characters. And from the start of his own career, James proved a shrewd and successful businessmart in the literary market- place. It therefore seems surprising that we have had no extended treatment of money in James until Jan W. Dietrichson's The Image of Money in the American Novel of the Gilded Age (1969), a study which, despite its im- pressive title, devotes over half of its 418 pages to a thorough and skillful treatment of money in James's life and work. Now we also have Donald Mull's Henry James's "Sublime Economy," essentially dealing with the same subject that Dietrichson treats, but in a more selective way. Yet just as Mull's book lacks the thoroughness of The Image of Money, so too does it lack that book's stylistic grace and sense of direction. These short- comings are immediately evident. Mull's introductory chapter, for instance, neither defines the author's thesis nor excites interest in what is to follow. And these early flaws are indicative of much of the book's contents. I feel uneasy when I read that "Maggie's consciousness, in fact, once it gets going, is as fiercely inductive and analytic as any in James...." But I wince when I read that "Miss Blunt's bluntness is quite studied and, as the ending of the story shows, not quite accurate." When not thus using inaccurate prose to express questionable sentiments, Mull seems for the most part determined to be unclear at all cost. Most of his pages contain whole passages written in a bewildering style that is an altogether inadequate vehicle to convey a sense of the subtlety with which money insinuates itself into the lives of James's characters. These flaws are especially unfortunate, since there are a number of com- mendable aspects of Henry James's "Sublime Economy." When the author's style lacks mystification (as in the discussion of The American) the book provides some worthy critical insights. Mull has also done a diligent job of re- searching his topic, and he quotes with felicity from the Master and from the critics on the symbolic use of money in the Jamesian canon. The Later Style of Henry James should prove a welcome addition to the li- braries of all scholars working on James. The James devotee will find ample evidence in Seymour Chatman's brief text to support his admiration for what the author refers to as "James's ability to make us feel the vagueness of the inchoate creative state." Yet Chatman, who seldom proselytizes for the Masterf also sensibly remarks that "if one believes categorically that abstractness, vagueness, ellipsis, and so on are bad in themselves, then, of course, James's later style must seem a failure." Of the aspects of the later style that Chatman remarks upon, a number serve merely to confirm what we have long suspected: that "intangible grammatical subjects outnumber the tangible," for instance, or that "the mental category of many verbs is not determined by the verb itself but by its 360 HENRY IAMES</page><page sequence="97">context." Much else in Chatman, however, has that refreshing critical quality which opens new vistas onto the subject under consideration. The authort for instance, intelligently remarks upon the significance of James's fairly con- sistent and seemingly deliberate-practice of introducing "low grade" metaphors into the revised novels. But even that which at first glance seems abstruse- as, for instance, the consideration of James's use of Deixis- generally proves, upon closer inspection, to be most revelatory of the Master's technique. With Chatman's whole study, in fact, I have only one cavil; namely, I do not feel that the frequent use "of personal pronouns instead of proper names heightens the sense of intimacy and intense engage- ment with the characters," but rather that this technique generally serves to distance the characters from us-an effect which serves to heighten the ironic performances of Henry James. Chatman correctly observes that "one of the best, and certainly one of the more amusing ways of studying a style is through parodies.' As a climax to his intriguing monograph, therefore, he provides a comparison of a very suc- cessful parody of James by Max Beerbohm with a very unsuccessful one by W. H. D. Rouse. The comparison reveals a great deal about the later style and buttresses much of the argument that Chatman perspicaciously presents in his preceding chapters. In Workable Design John P. O'Neill deals with a potentially broader sub- ject than has been dealt with by any of the previously considered authors. He is "chiefly concerned with the manner in which the Jamesian action and situation elicit, control or fail to control the sympathetic interest of the reader" lO'Neill's statement of purpose, I must add, is buried unhappily in a footnote in his introductory chapter). O'Neill, however, shapes his thesis by dealing almost exclusively with five novels: The Portrait of a Lady, The Princess Casamassima, The Spoils of Poynton, The Awkward Age, and The Wings of the Dove. Each of these novels is afforded a separate chapter of dis- cussion. On occasion O'Neill's "readings" are totally wrong-headed. It seems to me perverse, for example, to state that in Maisie "the heroine is clearly superior, but superior because she refuses to participate in the corrupt actions of those around her." Given her situation and circumstances as provided by James, I fail to see how Maisie could choose "to participate" in the bizarre and selfish events of the adult world that she bears witness to. I furthermore fail to see in what way The Sacred Fount can be said to deal with "the significance of a particular relationship." I grant that this novel's plot is not an easy one to "track,'t but surely it is more strictly accurate to say that The Sacred Fount deals with a number of "presumed" relationships. On the positive side, O'NeiGl makes very sensible remarks concerning Jamff's use of characterization and action in The Princess Casamassima and The Awkward Age. He intelligently illumines The Spoils of Poynton by com- paring James's notebook entries with the finished novel. He moreover provides a number of thoughtful comments on the characterization of Isabel Archer in The Portrait, and the way in which James manipulates the structure of the novel to guide our eventual response to her changing state of life. Workable Design is a brief book, but O'Neill works with a deft touch that is very appropriate to his subject; he possesses that critical gift that lets one know when just enough has been said. This is not the case, unfortunately, with the majority of the essays in The Air of Reality. 361</page><page sequence="98">HENRY IAMES Of the nine essays in this collection, most share the flaws of the article on The Wings of the Dove which editor John Goode himself contributes; namely, an unhappy propensity to try to "tell all" about the novel being considered (with a single exception, all of the articles in the volume under review deal with only one novel) and a fundamental lack of critical sensitivity. Goode, for instance, asserts that "The Wings of the Dove remg.s a convincing comedy about the ultimate mystification of the intel!ectual," an unsupported (if not unsupportable) statement which fails to do justice to the complexity of James's magnificent performance. But not all of Goode's state- ments are of such a contestable nature. He makes some percipient remarks concerning the character of Kate Croy, and does well in noting Balzac's rela- tionship to the novel, but all of his penetrating critical observations appear in the first two parts of an eight part, fifty-five page article. R. W. Butterfield's essay on The American makes some interesting com- ments on the Master's revisions of that novel for the New York edition, but the essay is basically "a reading"-and a very heavy-handed one at that. But- terfield sees Newman as "first and foremost a figure allegorical in con- ception," at best an arguable assertion which the critic does not convincingly buttress. David Howard labors in vain to prove the "greatness" of that rare Jamesian novelistic failure The Bostonians. In his article, "The Ambassador and The Sacred Fount: The Artist Manque," Bernard Richards annoyingly asserts that The Sacred Fount "is an autobiography." He furthermore judges that "Strether is a man who is timid, self-centered, ungenerous, over-diplo- matic, untrustworthy and on many occasions untrusting." In "The Novel to End All Novels: The Golden Bowl," Gabriel Pearson argues that "in The Golden Bowl, as in the Wings of the Dove and The Ambassadors, James's ab- ject women, driven by sensual passion, are one with the women victims of naturalism." While I do not wholeheartedly disagree with this assessment as it applies to Charlotte Stant, I do not think that it applies to either of the major female characters in Wings or to the wonderful Madame de Vionnet of The Ambassadors. Pearson also contends that the complex style of The Golden Bowl hinders James's performance, but the critic argues his case in a style that is considerably more otiose than that which he claims for the Master of Modern Fiction. The article on The Tragic Muse by D. J. Gordon and John Stokes is a rambling and stuffy 86 page "interpretation" which claims that the novel is "syncretic, that it uses parabolic commentary (a verbal art) and verbal misunderstanding, which is a form of wit," as "part of its ironic strategy." Ju- liet Mitchell's "reading" of What Maisie Knew is filled with disconcerting and ill-conceived remarks, but it at least has the virtue (in this collection) of being brief. Two essays in The Air of Reality, however, are brilliant irrespective of what surrounds them. John Lucas deftly places Washington Square "in the tradition that Jane Austen's fiction inaugurates" and proceeds to make a number of very perceptive comments on James's "rendering of contexts" in the novel. In her cogent essay on TheAwkwardAge, Margaret Walters writes perspicaciously of "The Ingenious Observer" in the novel. And when she re- marks that Mrs. Brook, Van, and Mitchy are prisoners of "their own preoccu- pation with style," Walters presents this relatively neglected masterpiece in new and attractive lights. I think that this is the best article in The Air of Reality; I know that it is the best treatment of The Awkward Age that I have seen. 362</page><page sequence="99">B Aziz, Maqbool, ed.

ROBINSON JEFFERS: MYTH, RITUAL, AND SYMBOL IN HIS NARRATIVE POEMS. Foreword by William Everson. Case Western Reserve University Press, 1973.340 pp. $12.50 Reviewed by ARTHUR B. COFFIN, Montana State University After many and lengthy delays by his publisher, Professor Brophy's study of Jeffers is now a part of the growing scholarly commentary on a major American poet whose work, until recently, has received disappointingly little attention that has moved beyond either blind enthusiasm or blind antago- nism a division which is occasionally still curiously evident in reviews of such scholarship. In the Foreword, which bears his marked stylistic and critical signature, William Everson reminds us that Brophy brings to his work the advantages of complete Jesuit training in theology, graduate degrees in philosophy, literature, and theology, and a doctorate in English under the di- rection of O. B. Hardison. This impressive and (rnost important for Jeffers criticism) disciplined theological and literary training is evident in Brophy's study. Equally important, however, is the possibility that Brophy, working for years in the center of the Jeffers milieu in California and editing since 1969 the Robinson Jeffers Newsletter (which under his hand turned from an un- 367</page><page sequence="104">ROBINSON IEFFERS prepossessing newsletter to a significant clearing house and exchange center for Jeffers news and scholarship) possesses more data and information than anyone else about the ongoing study of Jeffers. Understandably, then, one has waited for this work with heightened expectations. Brophy devotes a chapter apiece to 8'Tamar't (1924)/ "Roan Stalliontf (1925), "The Tower Beyond Tragedy" (1925), "Cawdor" (1928), "At the Birth of an Age" (1935), which he chose "because they seem to represent Jeffers at his finest and most typical," and to "Apology for Bad Dreams" (1926), which he correctly identifies as Jefferst ars poetica. Although there can still be heard occasional dissenting voices, most readers of Brophy's study will readily agree with him that "the poet's life-work is . . . the record of a fervent quest for a sacramental view of reality by which Jeffers hoped to live in peace and in full possession of the cosmic 'Beauty' which he so reverently worshipped." Indeed, the major achievement of his endeavor is the extent to which Brophy succeeds in demonstrating the validity of the claim that Jeffers viewed the universe, the '@beauty of things" of the earth in particular, as theophanic. Urging his readers to accept the formula "BEING = DYNAMISM = V10- LENCE = PAIN = BEAUTY = GOD" as essentially the explanation of Jeffers' preoccupation with narratives dealing with tortured existence, Brophy de- velops the premise that Jeffers' narratives repeatedly represent mythic ver- sions of "the monomyth of eternal return' which "interprets nature's life- ritual to man.t' These narratives (excluding "Apology") were selected because they reveal for Brophy that "Jeffers' chosen genre is reductively ritual tragedy...." Brophy claims that '(Jeffers' plot-patterns are ritualistic because he sees the world's dynamism (and within it man's life) as ri- tualistic.... The myth-ritual approach, therefore, is seen as a key to Jeffers' poetic vision...." Confronted with this, Brophy's reader must face two ques- tions. The first is the claim that Jeffers' narratives suffer from a reductivism which is compounded by the reductive effect of the '8myth-rituai approach" itself. Consider the remarks of M. H. Abrams apropos of archetypal criticism in his "The Correspondent Breeze: A Romantic Metaphor" (1960): "For literary criticism ... the ultimate criterion is not whether a doctrine is a justifiable psychological hypothesis, but what it does when put to work inter- preting a text. And from this point of view standard archetypal criticism can be charged with blurring, if it does not destroy, the properties of the literary products it undertakes to explicate.... For the result of such reading is to collapse the rich diversity of individual works into one, or into a very limited number, of archetypal patterns, which any one poem shares not only with other poems, but with such unartful phenomena as myth, dreams, and the fantasies of psychosis." The risk of Brophy's "myth-ritual approach" is that a subtext will be established that will threaten the autonomy of the original poem. Most of Brophy's readers will undoubtedly agree, since Jeffers gives the point great stress, that Jeffers poetry is concerned with "discovery." For Brophy, though he is considering a canon that clearly implies process, dis- covery appears to mean the disclosure of what is (at one point he negligently equates "being" with "becoming") rather than the exploration of what can (or shou Id) be. In view of Jeffers' repeated references to the "beauty of things" (88the coast opposite humanity")r the second question to be confronted by Brophy's reader is to determine where, in fact, "nature's life-ritual" resides. Is it res- ident in natural phenomena as they exist (as Brophy occasionally affirms), or 368</page><page sequence="105">is it in the mind of man as he attempts to understand the significance of natural phenomena? Jeffers' "Apology," which is not as difficult as Brophy makes it out to be, addresses this second question and offers artistically and philosophically viable answers, as does much of his later work, which does not fall significantly within the scope of Brophy's study. In his examination of these poems, Brophy gives the sense that he worked in isolation with respect to other Jeffers scholarship: he appears neither to debate with anyone nor to rebut any other critical stances. He may have con- cluded the degree of simplicity thus gained was the better strategy, especially in a book that is highly (perhaps unnecessarily so) structured. Since he views these narratives as tragedies, he divides them into five sections (Introduction, Complication, Crisis, Catastrophe, Denouement), a decision with respect to certain poems which some of his readers will view either as strained or in- teresting. In this and other ways, each chapter is rigidly structured and to add another, polemical dimension might easily have been more than could be borne. An appendix that discusses the relationship of Northrop Frye's "The Theory of Myths" to Brophy's view of Jeffers' work should certainly have been integrated with the Introduction. Everson's Foreword is unfortunate: it and what follows in Brophy's exegeses are distinctly different kinds of dis- course, and one wonders what exigencies or loyalties brought about its in- clusion in a scholarly study. Finally, Brophy's work is an important and challenging contribution to our understanding of Jeffers. His reading of "Roan Stallion," aside from the di- vision into acts, is probably the best one available, and his readings of other poems truly merit serious consideration though they may not receive it from the casual Jeffers enthusiast.

The Press of Case Western Reserve University, 1972.146 pp. $6.95. 369</page><page sequence="106">JAMES JOYCE This compact and well-planned study of Dubliners, Stephen Hero, and the Portrait is basically concerned with Joyce's gradual discovery of a perspective in which to view the world that enabled him finally to achieve that peculiarly Joycean fusion of self with otherness that distinguishes his later and more mature work. Using new evidence that Stephen Hero did not precede the writing of most of the stories in Dubliners but was composed largely at the same time, Brown is able to show how the realism of those works depended largely on the artist as passive and detached observer. If Dubliners had ap- peared without "The Dead," as originally planned, we might still have only Stephen Hero in lieu of the Portrait. But the writing of "The Dead" drastically altered Joyce's own conception of his relationship to reality, Stephen Hero had to be abandoned, and from then on Stephen was to stand firmly as an active participant in the world he describes dispassionately. Brown pays little attention to the biographical and psychological factors which help to explain this transition, but his study is a subtle and sophisticated study of the ways in which that transition is manifested technically and stylistically in the three key works of Joyce's literary apprenticeship.

D The Summer 1973 issue of The Dublin Magazine was largely a Joyce number with articles by Benedict Kiely on "A Cow in the House"; Bernard Benstock on "Joyce's Swift"; John Ryan on "Rosevean: Ulysses' Silent Ship"; Richard M. Kain on "The Spirit of Place in Irish Literature"; Sam Bluefarb on "Quest, Initiation and Escape: American Themes in James Joyce's 'An Encounter' "; John Raymond Hart on "Moore on Joyce"; James Murphy on "Purging Frog"; Desmond Hogan on "Poltergeists"; and J. B. Lyons on "Irish Doctors and Literature." The four 1973 issues of James Joyce Quarterly featured a number of significant new full-length essays in addition to the usual notes, reviews, correspondence, and miscellanea. The Winter issue (X-2) includes Suzanne Henig on "Ulysses in Bloomsbury," Harry C. Staley on "The Spheretual Exercises of Dedalus and Bloom," Albert J. Solomon on "A Moore in Ulysses," and a study of Parnellian as- pects in "Ivy Day in the Committee Room" by Frederick C. Stern. The Spring number (X-3) contains articles by David E. Jones on Joyce's aesthetics and Phillip L. Marcus on the "Scylla and Charybdis" episode of Ulysses as well as "Additional Allusions in 'Eumaeus' " by Richard K. Bass. An excellent analysis of "The Sisters" by Florence L. Walzl leads off the Summer issue tX-4) and is followed by studies of Ulysses by Jean Kimball and Diane Tolomeo. Robert Scholes's "In Search of James Joyce" in the Fall issue (Xl-1) deals largely with some of the sources of the con- cept of the epiphany. Included also in that issue are an essay on "Ulysses and the Hog Butchers" by Robert Billings and Donald Zochert, a study of "Penelope" by James Van Dyck Card, and an analysis of Exiles by John MacNicholas.

In addition to all the usual papers, seminars, and panel discussions, there will be a Joyce exhibit under the direction of Bernard Gheerbrant, whose 1949 exhibition was a major event in the history of Joyce's reputation. There will be a Joyce Film Festival, as well as concerts and theatrical performances devoted to or inspired by his work, and Gisele Freund will show her remarkable photographic record of Joyce in Paris.

Reviewed by MARIA LUISE CAPUTO-MAYR It is important for Kafka scholars and students to have at their disposal more reference books on Kafka criticism, general as well as specific, in order to gain an overview of and an insight into the still intricate situation of such 373</page><page sequence="110">FRANZ KAFKA criticism. Corngold's commented selection of studies on The Metamorphosis is a step in the right direction in offering a rich array of viewpoints on one of Kafka's most fascinating, controversial, and enigmatic shorter prose pieces. Two well-documented essays on The Metamorphosis by Corngold himself appear in the introductory part of the book: the first deals with the nature of metaphor and Kafka's ideas and experiments with this device, the realistic segments of the narration, aesthetic considerations, and the interrelation of story with Kafka's life and art; the second essay comments on the symbolical and allegorical interpretations of The Metamorphosis. The major body of the book consists of "A Critical Bibliography of The Metamorphosis." This portion opens with a listing of German editions and English translations of The Metamorphosis and presents in alphabetical order 128 titles of research which appear in abstract form together with extensive quotations of significant passages which are frequently commented upon with objectivity. Such a cross-section of critical views spanning a period of about thirty years is not only a valuable tool for the researcher and scholar, but also gives the beginner an introduction to the vastness of the field and the varied facets of possible evaluation of a work of art. Several minor mis- spellings and printing errors do not detract too much from the general value of this compilation. On the other hand, Ruth T;efenbrun's study, interesting reading though it is, reverts to exclusively psychological speculation of the kind that has by now been abandoned by most Kafka scholars. Her central hypothesis is that of a homosexual Kafka, troubled by his secret, anxious to conceal his plight, and reaching an inner balance only at the end of his life in his relationship with Dora Diamant. Psychological and psychoanalytical views are by now tactfully incorporated into a larger and more general picture of Kafka's life and art by the newer trends of research that also devote much attention to the formal, stylistic, and structural aspects of Kafka's work in spite of "trans- lating" them into some "jargon" or using them to reach conclusions about the writer's personality and character traits. The study does not compare either with Calvin and Hall's findings nor with earlier brilliant inquisitions like Hellrnuth Kaiser's in Imago. It is the work of a Kafka lover yes, but one that has not taken into account the changes that have occurred in the field of Kafka criticism. We cannot agree that Kafka's writings are a kind of autobiography referring mostly to homosexuality and hiding the unmentionable shame by the usage of a secret code of reference. Tiefenbrun bases her theory on that same short story fragment of Kafkats early diary in which Politzer saw the first sketch of the typical Kafka bachelor- hero. She then discusses Kafka's '8substitution code" and explains the assumed meanings of the writer's chiffres. In Kafka's "indestructable't element she sees his homosexual tendency. She thoroughly searches three short stories ("lnvestigations of a Dog,'t "The Judgement" and The Metamor- phosis) for confirmation of her assumptions, the first presenting the ho- mosexual encounter, the second Kafka's relation to his father and the writer's marriage plans, and the last a possible disclosure of his secret. Even Kafka's request to his friend Max Brod that he destroy his papers and writings after his death has originated purportedly, so Tiefenbrun says, in Kafka's fear of being discovered. 374</page><page sequence="111">Gray, Ronald.

LE1TERS TO FELICE, edited by Erich Heller and Jurgen Born; trans- lated' by James Stern and Elisabeth Duckworth. Schocken Books, 1973. 620 pp. $1 7.50. This substantial volume is a major contribution to the Kafka canon, for it con- sists of hundreds of letters which he wrote to Felice Bauer, the young woman to whom he was twice betrothed. Because he Zived in Prague and she in Berlin, his courtship was necffsarily made largely through corrffpondence, and as one would expect of such a courtship, he felt it necffsary to tell her much about himself-his physical nature, his attitude towards art and life, the progress he was making in the writing of such key works as The Trial and Metamorphosis, and the day-by-day events of his life from 1912 to 1917. Let- ters to Felice is therefore an indispensable source book for Kafka scholars, and because most of the letters were written in Kafka's characteristic style, often mixing wit with irony, they are also important additions to his literary output. Erich Heller contributes an excellent introductory essay, and the volume is generously endowed with notes and other apparatus. Sheppard, Richard. ON KAFKAwS CASTLE: A STUDY.

Academic criticism has tended to place Kipling outside the mainstream of the English literary tradition. Through his detailed analysis of Kipling's works, Shahane places him within this tradition. In a brief biographical introduction the author discusses the many influences which shaped Kipling's imagination and emphasizes the importance of his Anglo-lndian background on his con- tinual search for identity. Since Shahane considers Kim to be Kipling's deepest and most important work, he devotes an extensive section to analyzing the complexities of the novel. Other sections discuss minor fiction, short stories, and poetry. C Lohman, William John. Kipling's Experiences and Artistic Rendering of Culture Shock. Duke, 1972, Lionel Stevenson. DA XXXIII-6365.

Seven Pillars of Wisdom has previously attracted some attention, but only as an historical and political record of the Arab Revolt. Meyers considers it a literary work of genius and places it beside Remembrance of Things Past, The Magic Mountain, and Ulysses. Accordingly, he studies the themes, structure, and style of the work and examines Lawrence's self-portrayal and dramatiza- tion. Since textual interpretation frequently depends on biographical in- formation, Meyers has culled unpublished manuscripts for useful facts.

Crosscurrents / Modern Critiques. Southern Illinois University Press, 1973. 144 pp. $5.95. Reviewed by BETTY THOMPSON, New York City Doris Lessing has said more than once what she thinks of critics. Not much. She despises academic paraphernalia and deplores anything which stands between the reader and the work. Despite her tough talk about the foolish- ness of Professors Black and White, Doris Lessing has generously cooperated with a number who solemnly quote her put-downs and scan her polite, self- deprecatory, and gently mocking responses for footnote materials. Lessing urges students to test writing by their own experience and not by scholarly preconceptions or misconceptions. The fact that one critic at the time caught on to her intention in The Golden Notebook fuels her contempt. Lessing dis- likes interviews, critical articles, the exploitation of the artist to promote the sale of books, and all attempts to substitute curiosity about the authorts life and work habits for the work itself. Paul Schlueter reverently tries to take his subject's dislike for the biographical fallacy into account, but unfortunately the result is likely to confirm her opinion of the irrelevance of criticism. Overpowered by his admiration, he provides neither the kind of true criticism which points an author to weaknesses which might be remedied nor the reader to new and deeper insights about her. Diligent work, genuine and often intelligent admiration, and dogged tracking are here, but there is little that would add substantially to another reader's insights. Schlueter takes too seriously his own earlier monograph, "Doris Lessing: The Free Woman's Commitment," published in Charles Shapiro's Contemporary British Novelists in 1957. That in turn relied on a much-quoted 1956 ffsay, "The Small Personal Voice," which Doris Lessing wrote for a collection of the "angries" of that decade called Declaration. There she discussed commitment to the individual and the collective conscience. Taking this as one of his main approaches to the fiction of Doris Lessing, Schlueter allows his face-value appraisal of this early essay to blind him to some of his own more acute insights. Aware of the place that dreams and dreaming play in her work, he never explores them in anything like the depth they deserve. He is on to some important insights about her attitude towards sex yet allows a prudish comment by Storm Jameson to stand for his own discovery about the biological limits of the "free woman." Schlueter observes that Lessing heroines more often than not fall for Jewish men, but in all the African settings never once does a white 383</page><page sequence="120">DORIS LESSING heroine have any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with a black man. Here he has touched on a great reticence and final reserve of the white woman growing up in an apartheid society. Only the first novel, The Grass Is Singing, deals with this subject and then from the point of view of a sick woman. Schlueter's opinions of Lessing were formed primarily on the basis of the Martha Quest series and The Golden Notebook. Although his book treats the later apocalyptic conclusion to the Quest series, The Four-Gated City, and Briefing for A Descent into Hell, he obviously has not been able to incor- porate the charges evident in these books into his basic theory. Unlike Dorothy Brewster in her 1965 Twayne book, he has had an opportunity to see how Martha Quest ends. One cannot help but feel a bit sorry for Schlueter, an early apostle of Lessing, as the scene changes from critical famine to feast. The solitary picnicker has been joined by a vast group of banqueters who fill whole issues of magazines (see the Autumn 1973 issue of Contempo- rary Literature). One of the first in the field an early thesis writer (this book is the adaptation), first to organize a symposium on Lessing at the MLA- Schlueter has been left both by the subject and her admirers. Pouring over Lessing, whose prolixity and changes in subject matter provide rich lore, the newer critics outdistance him. Some, like the one who writes about the "Pieta as ikon" on the basis of a scene in The Golden Notebook in which Anna holds her lover in her arms, make one long for his pedestrian ap- proach. Others brilliantly dissect the brilliant writer. In her outcry against critics, Doris Lessing discusses the difference in the way a reader perceives a book and the way it was intended by an author. And she comes to an unusual conclusion: "that it is not only childish of a writer to want readers to see what he sees, to understand the shape and aim of a novel as he sees it, but that his wanting this means that he has not understood a most fundamental point which is that the book is alive and fructifying and able to promote thought and discussion only when its plan and shape and intention are not understood, because that moment of seeing the shape and plan and intention is also the moment when there isn't anything more to be gotten out of it" (Partisan Review, Winter 1973). Doris Lessing attracts not your ordinary hack literary journalist but such valuable novelist peers as Margaret Drabble (Ramparts, February 1972) and Joyce Carol Oates (Southern Review, Winter 1974), for it is as impossible to ignore the person of Doris Lessing in considering her work as it is to examine Eugene Gant without regard to Thomas Wolfe. Like Wolfe, Lessing has protested the efforts of reviewers and critics to make exact equations be- tween author and protagonists Martha-Doris or Anna-Lessing. Florence Howe's complete tape of her 1965 London interview and the perceptive probes of Drabble and Oates tell us important and necffsary things. Schlueter in his honorable but misguided respect for Lessing does not make significant use of the biographical information. Neither her excursions into Suftsm nor the recurrent theme of mental breakdown as a form of healing are adequately treated. One suspects trouble with a critic who uses "relate meaningfully" on his second page and who is capable of "unique to her alone." Hear Schlueter on the African leader Mathalong: "He sees, in a word, not only the heights to which man's sense of ethicality can raise him, but also that sense of ethicality in perspective, in relation to those more sordid areas of life such as the in- 384</page><page sequence="121">exorably slow progress visible in racial terms at any one moment." He does little in placing Lessing among her contemporaries except to say that she has more feeling than Mary McCarthy and that her fiction is more interesting than de Beauvoir. And he fails to see that Mary McCarthy is essentially a wit and that de Beauvoir, a bore when she turns to fiction, shares Doris Lessing's greatest flaw taking herself too seriously, being concerned with the cosmic at the expense of the comic. Defending his subject against the charge of repetitive variations on single themes, he cites Hemingway and Faulkner for doing the same thing, characterizing Faulkner's work as "variations on the sickness and decline of a particular section of the country." While it is tempting to mock, it is unfair to suggest that all the writing is of this caliber. It is usually better though hardly more than serviceable. Helpful plot summaries are a major part of the book, but they are done no better and sometimes with startling similarity to those of Dorothy Brewster (see espe- cially the same quotations from the play, "Each His Own Wilderness"). Nor does he treat the nearly 100 stories Doris Lessing has written. Like Brewster, he ignores the profound emotional impression made on her by Olive Schreiner, yet he had access to Lessing's own lengthy commentary on Schreiner, published as an Afterword to the Fawcett paperbac^k edition of The Story of An African Farm. He gives the date of this book as 1833, twenty- two years before Schreiner's birth. Annoyingly, in the treatment of the Quest series as one long novel, he sometimes mentions the particular title he is dis- cussing and at others refers to the volume number without mentioning the novel titles. A reader already interested in Doris Lessing may be impatient with the ap- proach but still find some useful information and insights from one who has spent a lot of love on the subject. But Lessing is more, much more than the summary afforded by Schlueter in this slight book. Voyaging in her lush jungle, each reader must make his or her own way. Following the neat marks made by Schlueter might lead down the wrong clearly marked track. Joyce Carol Oates warns us that Lessing's unique sensitivity, combining both her own intense experience and the spirit of the times, is a gift that "cannot be analyzed; it must on Iy be honored."

Reviewed by TIMOTHY MATERER, Universtiy of Missouri "The seed of paranoia is the arrival of the conviction that the truth about oneself is never told." This observation by Norman Mailer illuminates Wyndham Lewis' character even better than it does Mailer's. As a result of his political tracts, Lewis' novels are rarely judged on their own merits, and his early (1930) sympathy with Hitler's plan for German self-determination threw a cloud over his reputation that obscures his gifts even today. For example, John Harrison in The Reactionaries (Schocken, 1967) reduces Lewis' novels to propaganda pieces and cannot fathom the personal struggles behind Lewis' political stands. Harrison's analyses of the right-wing politics of Lewis, Yeats, Lawrence, Eliot, and Pound resemble a recent book by William Chace, The Political Identities of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot (Stanford, 1973). Neither Har- rison nor Chace put their own political beliefs on the line; their "liberalismtt is no less vague than Eliot's notorious "Royalism." However justly they de- plore the authoritarianism of writers like Pound and Eliot, they never es- 386</page><page sequence="123">tablish their own credentials for judging men who so painfully and (in Lewis' and Pound's cases) so disastrously took unpopular stands. D. G. Bridson in The Filibuster avoids this weakness because his own par- ticipation in left-wing British politics in the Thirties gives him the confidence and the first-hand knowledge to make fair and precise judgments. He writes that "the evolving pattern of [Lewis'] political ideas can only be studied as a graph in which the course of contemporary events provides one of the co- ordinates." His command of contemporary history, particularly that of the Thirties, is remarkable. His account of Lewis' interest in Hitler's policies, for example, is placed in the context of political events from Versailles to Munich. Writing frankly that "Lewis had been dangerously naive in his esti- mate of the German menace" throughout the Thirties, he does not excuse him because his favorable judgments on Hitler came at an early date. Bridson cites writers as far back as January, 1931 "who had forseen exactly what Hitler intended." But he also shows that most English analysts could not understand Hitler's threat any better than Lewis, that Lewis' outrage over the Versailles sanctions against Germany was sincere, and that Lewis was not motivated (despite the claims of many critics) by antisemitism. Bridson's painstaking account of what Lewis actually wrote in a score of books now out of print is sometimes heavy-going, but it is needed to set the record straight about Lewis' alleged "Fascism." Decades of misinterpretation did indeed nurture Lewis' paranoia, although the seed of it was planted even before he fought in France during World War I. Robert T. Chapman's chapter on "The Malefic Cabal," Lewis' rather melodramatic term for Bloomsbury, shows that Lewis did suffer from the contempt of influential Bloomsbury critics. But this opposition fueled the imagination of a great satirist. Lewis' anatomy of England in the Twenties, The Apes of God, is largely motivated by his hatred for Bloomsbury, and especially for what he considered the trivial estheticism and elitist spirit of Roger Fry. Chapman's book is the first exclusively devoted to Lewis' fiction. Although his juggling of the terms "fiction," "novel," and "satire" is often confusing, Chapman gives us a useful introduction to Lewis' art. For Chapman, the key to Lewis' career is that he "carried over into life the traditional persona of the satirist; an ac- count of his feud with Bloomsbury is included in this study as the epitome of this role." Lewis in the Twenties is remembered as a sinister figure in an eye-shading hat, who always sat with his back to the wall and whose only address was a post office box. Like Norman Mailer, Lewis put his paranoiac suspicions to good use. Bridson makes a brief comparison of Lewis to Mailer that could go further. Both Lewis and Mailer are brilliant social critics because of their sense of what Thomas Pynchon calls "operational paranoia." Each writer de- tects a gigantic plot to destroy our liberties. Lewis, writing as a "Tory- Bolshevik," blames "Big Business"; Mailer, a "Left Conservative," accuses "corporation land." Both critics find in our newspapers, architecture, ad- vertising, the products we buy, and the clothes we wear a conspiracy to regiment our lives and destroy any beauty or style in our environment. Lewis' distrust extended to any organized literary, political, or social group because, as he wrote in The Art of Being Ruled, our rulers "for the purpose of political domination... separate people as rigidly as possible. The more classes, associations, syndics occupational, sex, age, cultural categories-into which 387</page><page sequence="124">WYNDHAM LEWIS you cut them up and pen them, the more manageable (for the more divided and helpless) they are." As D. G. Bridson concludes, no one but Lewis "could have turned a more brilliant spotlight on the various ways in which the worst in all of us can be flattered and used and directed to defeat the best in us.... Despite the misuse which he felt had been made of the word, freedom was what as individual as intellectual Lewis valued most on earth." B Lewis, Wyndham. THE ROARING QUEEN.

ROSE MACAULAY A Smith, Constance Babington. ROSE MACAULAY. London: Collins, 1972. 254 pp. £3.25. R eviewed by JANE EARL Y Biographies of English literary figures from the twenties and thirties increas- ingly resemble family sagas with numerous sequels, all populated with fa- miliar characters who never fail to delight their readers. One would be disap- pointed not to find the Woolfs, the Middleton Murrys, the Lehmanns, the Nicolsons, and all too briefly Rupert Brooke. This biography of Rose Macaulay, though far more modest in proportions than the othersJ is no ex- ception. Smith writes with obvious delight in her subject and succeeds ad- mirably in bringing to life this talented and indomitable woman. Her nar- rative is lively and is especially good at the childhood scenes. The assistance of Rose's sister, Jean, is most evident in the somewhat painful details of Mrs. Macaulay's erratically preferential and surely damaging treatment of her children. But there are at the same time some serious omissions. One would expect that Rose, brought up in a sheltered familial environment, would have found Oxford a heady experience. But Smith provides little information about Rose's intellectual development during these crucial years. Later, Smith makes it clear that Rose chose not to marry, indeed that she could not under- stand why anyone would choose to live with another when he could live alone. At the same time, Rose found all of the emotional fulfillment she needed in her affair with Gerald OtDonovan which endured until his death. At a time when people are solemnly searching for "alternative life styles," Rose Macaulay's apparently sane and satisfactory solution should serve as some sort of exemplar. But before one becomes lost in admiration for her courage and self-knowledge, he should remember that not only did Rose never marry, but neither did any of her numerous sisters and brothers. Surely a biographer should offer some explanation of (or speculation about) ehis cu- rious fact. Smith, however, is silent. Similarly, Smith indicates that Rose Macaulay received from Gerald 390</page><page sequence="127">O'Donovan the kind of support which George Eliot derived from George Henry Lewes, but, whether from lack of information or from reticence, she does not reveal concretely the effect which O'Donovan had on Rose's artistic life beyond stating that the special quality of Rose's middle-period novels "can be attributed very largely to the influence of Gerald." At a time of satu- ration biography these omissions are at least surprising. For the most part, the novels themselves are handled rather perfunctorily, and Smith mentions but does not handle adequately the effect which Rose's need to make money had on her art. Smith handles most thoroughly Rose's late novels, The World My Wilderness and The Towers of Trebizond, deftly revealing how Rose's personal experience is reflected in the novels. Indeed, the final section contains many of the high points of the biography. Usually, it is disheartening but true that the subjects of biography seldom do anything in old age sufficient to maintain our interest in them. But Rose Macaulay continued to write until she died, to turn up eagerly for any party given, to chain her bicycle to the railing of the London Library, and to send her car ca- reening through the London streets. Several years before she died, she returned with fervor to the Anglican Church at which she had sneered for so long. Smith narrates the story of her conversion in such a way that the con- clusion seems both inevitable and fitting. Rose's death is described quite simply in two paragraphs and is followed by a series of reminiscences written by Harold Nicolson, Rosamund Lehmann, Alan Pryce-Jones, Patrick Kinross, C. V. Wedgwood, Mark Bonham Carter, Anthony Powell, William Plomer, and Diana Cooper. Rosamund Lehmann seems to capture in few words so much of the essential quality of Rose Macaulay. When she heard of Rose's sudden death, she thought: "'But we have all just seen her, just been talking to her! How like her to slip off and run lightly, unhampered, without back- ward glance, straight into her death. Straight through it."' CARSON McCULLERS C Bauerly, Donna M.

Since Mandelstam was a poet who disdained to write down his verses and only did so at the insistence of his wife and since so much of his work barely escaped destruction, it is remarkable that his work is even availa!rle to us. It is equally remarkable that Brown was able to produce this fine introduction, working as he was against the obstacles of faulty texts and inadequate biographical information. For example, the date and place of the poet's death is not known nor his grave found. Nevertheless, Brown has produced a work which presents the known biographical information and at the same time recreates splendidly the culture of Russian life. Since he wants the book to serve also as an anthology of Mandelstam's poems, he reprints a large number of poems which he has translated himself. Moreover, he includes a thorough critical treatment of Mandelstam's three collections of poems. All in all this work should accomplish the much-needed task of making this Russian poet better known to Western readers. 394</page><page sequence="131">Mandelstam, lsladezla. MOZART AND SALIERI: AN ESSAY ON OSIP MANDELSTAM AND POETIC CREATIVITY, trans. Robert A. McLean. Ardis, 1973. 119 pp. S2.95. Covering a variety of topics from the nature of the creative impulse to the difference between painting and poetry and the need for the preservation of a poet's rough drafts, this essay-memoir by Osip Mandelstam's widow chiefly explores the poet's identification of two types of poetic creativity the divine inspiration or secret hearing of Mozart and the laborious toil of Salieri as depicted in Pushkin's one-act tragedy, Mozart and Salieri. Mandelstam, we learn, revised his original thesis that in every poet there is something of both Mozart and Salieri to one repudiating Mozart in favor of the craftsman Salieri. THOMAS MANN A Berendsohn, Walter E. THOMAS MANN: ARTISAN AND PARTISAN llM TROU- BLED TIMES, trans. George C. Buck. University of Alabama Press, 1973. 262 pp. $10. Carnegy, Patrick. FAUST AS MUSICIAN: A STUDY OF THOMAS MANN'S DOCTOR FAUSTUS. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1973.182 pp. £2.50. Reviewed by CALVIN S. BROWN, University of Georgia Berendsohn's book can be said, in a way, to relate Mann's literary work to his life and to his polemic and political writing. But its method is to go through the works chronologically, devoting an inordinate amount of space to plot summaries and long quotations, so that littZe room is left for criticism or in- terpretation. Since these are usually done in an obvious (and frequently gushing) way, little is lost; but I am not sure what purpose the work really serves, since it will hardly appeal to a reader who has not read Mann, and will contribute little to one who has. Probably the one really useful thing is the chapter on Mann's correspondence, which tells not only what parts of it have been published, but also when and where. The translation does not help. Berendsohn's original text is competent, un- distinguished German academic prose, but Buck's translation is not an English equivalent. It is plodding and cluttered, with adverbs popping up in the most unlikely places and relative pronouns wildly searching for their re- mote antecedents. There is a distressing tendency to carry over the German word, even when it means something different in English: epic for "nar- rative," pathos for "sentiment" or "feeling," and, worst of all, genial for "brilliant" or "endowed with genius." Mann's Adrian Leverkuhn is a cold, haughty, aloof man, and it is a bad shock to hear him described, three times, as "genial." We even find a gramophone record being called a plate for no better reason than that the German word is Platte. All together, there was little reason for this book to be written, less for it to be translated, and none at all for it to be so traduced. The only thing I really learned from it is that Thomas Mann was a Rotarian, and I was happier without that knowledge. It is a relief to turn to Patrick Carnegy's Faust as Musician, a book that has a great deal to say and says it both gracefully and convincingly. The title might 395</page><page sequence="132">THOMAS MANN be taken to imply a book on the musical element in Doctor Faustus, and this subject is ably and knowledgeably treated, but it is not the primary concern. The real subject is stated in the epigraph in Mann's own words: "Music was only foreground and representation, only a paradigm for something more general, only a means to express the situation of art in general, or culture, even of man and the intellect itself in our so critical era. A novel of music? Yes. But it was also conceived as a novel of culture and the era." This statement indicates an ambitious program, and Carnegy qu ite properly takes Mann at his word. Thus he cannot approach Doctor Faustus as merely a modernized version of the Spiess chapbook, or as simply a musical novel with ingenious political parallels, or as primarily a virtuoso's tour de force in the montage technique, or as any of the other single-minded things which various critics have assumed it to be. The point is that it is all these things at once as well as a great many more. If we use the terms very broadly (considering theology as a part of philosophy, for example), we can define Doctor Faustus as a novel exploring the artistic, political, and philosophical problems of the modern world in all their complexities and interrelation- ships. The complexities are never shirked. To take only one example (which will necessarily be oversimplified here), Mann's instinctive reservations about the artist and his dubious integrity, already plainly visible in Buddenbrooks and thoroughly explored in Tonio KrOger, are well known. So are his early description of himself as an apolitical man and the later development when the hard facts of twentieth-century barbarism forced him to become a political thinker. Carnegy's discussion brings these matters into their logical relationship and shows that Mann finally accepted neither the easy answer that the artist must be rejected because he is politically dangerous nor the equally simple-minded art-for-art's-sake indifference to political morality. He came to see that the aims and methods of art and of politics are, and must be, different. "What Mann surely [tells] us here is that psychological wound and cerebral intoxication may be fertile in art, and even ethically justifiable, but that in the political and social sphere they are wholly evil and to be re- pudiated as such. They are potential sources of strength in art but in politics, only of catastrophe." The large view taken in this study is not obtained (as is sometimes done) by loftily ignoring the details, but by mastering them and not being dominated by them. Carnegy has a thorough command of all the relevant biographical and scholarly "literature," and uses it when it is to the point, but he uses it casually, without pedantry or exhibitionism. This is typical of the best British scholarship. Perhaps that is why commercial publishers in England can still bring out books like this on subjects which, in this country, only university presses would dare to touch. A useful appendix reprinting the epistolary wrangle between Mann and Schoenberg over the ownership of twelve-note serial technique, a brief bib- liography, and a useful index (proper names only, unfortunately) round out this excellent and stimulating book.

Not long after a young New Zealander named Kathleen Beauchamp entered a London girls' school in 1903 and chose as a pen-name "Katherine Mansfield," one of her classmates, Ida Baker, chose"Lesley Moore" as a new name for herself. The two remained intimate friends until Katherine Mansfield's death in 1923. Now, some fifty years later, "LM" has broken her silence by writing a frank and affectionate memoir of her friend. The book is especially rich in its account of Katherine's marriage with John Middleton Murry as well as in touching descriptions of her constant struggles against poor health.

Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1973.262 pp. $12. Demonstrating what might be called "projection," Masefield stated in a public address that "all writers long to understand the spirit of their race." Since so much of Masefield's work demonstrates a preoccupation with English life, the statement applies certainly to himself. Fraser Drew examines precisely those particular phases of English life which appear in Masefield's works and how he defines English life and the English spirit. More specificallyw Drew considers these subjects: Masefield's interest in England's past and literary tradition; his equation of love of country with love of countryside; his dedication to the common man; English games and other recreations; and English ships and sailors. The study concludes with a useful bibliography of primary works which includes translations and adaptations of the plays and the miscellaneous prose and of secondary works which include bibliographical material and full-length memoirs.

SOMERSET MAUGHAM AND THE QUEST FOR FREEDOM. Doubleday, 1973. 324 pp. $8.95. In the author's opinion, Maugham has for too long a time been snubbed by the intelligentsia and should be invited into the parlor to sit with the other artists of the second rank: Wells, Bennett, Galsworthy, Mackenzie, and Waugh. Though he had the bad taste to make more money than they did, his work is of more lasting value. To ensure that his subject will not be banished from this company, Calder performs the needful task of establishing for Maugham both a place within tradition and a dominant controlling theme. A short biographical introduction, which includes the earliest years in Paris where Maugham spoke French before learning English, the death of his beloved mother, and the isolation he experienced both in the house of his uncle and at school, reveals that Maugham's life was a long search for physical and spiritual freedom, a quest that dominates each of his novels. In discussing the novels, Calder's strategy is to place the work within a specific genre and tradition and then to point out what distinguishes Maugham's work from that of the tradition. For example, Maugham's first novel, Liza of Lambeth, clearly belongs with the slum novels written after 1880 but differs from them since Maugham is concerned not with economic matters, but with the restrictive nature of ghetto life. At the end of his study, Calder has inserted four appendices. The first identifies the original of Rosie in Cakes and Ale, a character who has intrigued readers only slightly less than Isher- wood's Sally Bowles. Another provides information about Maugham's espio- nage work in Russia in 1917, and a third catalogues the images of imprison- ment which Maugham consistently used. Of special interest should be the final discussion of five fictional portraits of this writer who himself created so many fictional portraits of others. 398</page><page sequence="135">C Tate, Michael Gerard.

VLADIMIR MAYAKOVSKY A Brown, Edward J. MAYAKOVSKY: A POET IN THE REVOLUTION. Princeton University Press, 1973. 386 pp. $16.50. This full length critical biography examines the Russian poet's work and the cultural context in which he lived as they highlight one another and contribute to an understanding of the artist and his age. Avoiding a strictly chronological treatment, Brown describes the political background out of which Mayakovsky, the young bolshevik agitator, emerged and traces the poet's contributions to the Futurist movement, his journey to America in 1925, his alienation from most contemporary politicians and artists, and his experiments with film and drama. Brown carefully examines Mayakovsky's major themes and meticulously explains his poetic technique, particularly his insistence upon rhyme and his experiments with accentual verse and the conversational phrase as a poetic unit. Finally Brown insists that the pull be- tween party work and art, evident from the beginning of Mayakovsky's career eventually overcame the poet and resulted in a sense of isolation that drove him to suicide in 1930. Four reproductions of illustrations from the first edition of About That, three photographs of Mayakovsky and his contemporaries, a brief bibliographical essay, and a curious combination of two indexes one solely of names and one of Mayakovsky's titles complete the volume.

VINCENT MILLAY. Schocken Books, 1973.146 pp. $2.95. Because Edna St. Vincent Millay has for so long been associated with high school textbooks and all the blandness that they imply, it is a delight to be reminded that she was once the succes de scandale of the 20s. In Sheean's pages she is remembered gliding around in jeans, swimming in the buff, and writing of her many "unremembered lads" to whom she would say, "I shall forget you presently, my dear." These glimpses of this vital and playful yet sensitive and solitary woman are, unfortunately, as rare as Sheean's spottings of the indigo bunting on Millay's windowsill. Millay's assertion that he scared the birds away because he was a "charging buffalo" is apt in more contexts than Aves; while a pleasant memoir, this slim volume too often over-senti- mentalizes and bludgeons what was in reality not an appreciably close rela- tionship. Nevertheless, the mood of regret and loss for the genteel world of weekend partiff and at-homes which Millay represented for Sheean per- meates this nostalgic look at a past which, alas, we can only appreciate, not share.

EUGENIO MONTALE. A CRITICAL STUDY OF HIS POETRY, PROSE, AND CRITICISM. Yale University Press, 1973.298 pp. $15. Reviewed by NICHOLAS PATRUNO, Bryn Mawr College This is the most complete study in English of Eugenio Montale, and the reader could not have asked for anything better or more fulfilling. Without 400 </page><page sequence="137">claiming to fwoffer any specialized thesis or exegesist" Singh examines in great detail all of Montale's poetry-welJ over sixty poems his prose, literary criticism, and translations. His presentation is marked by precision and clarity. Following an introductory chapter, which examines Montalets biography and places him within the literary frame of his time, Singh proceeds tQ discuss his various works without ever losing sight of the his- torical factors that add depth to his observations. in addition, the reader will also find three most useful appendices, one of which examines Montale's metre. This book follows by one year Glauco Cambon/s less voluminous but ex- tremely perceptive and illuminating study, Eugenio Montale (Columbia Essays on Modern Writers). With these two recent worksJ the English- speaking reader can boast of having at hand the most intelligent, pene- trating, and complete presentation of the works of one of the foremost poets of oljr time. By tracing the connectionst however subtle they may appear to beJ be- tween this poet and others, Singh wastes no time in placing Montale amc)ng the leading poets. Thus, in addition to mentioning Italian poets such as Dante, Petrarcat Leopardi, DrAnnunzio and Pascoli, Singh does not fail to in- dicate the influence, whether direct or indirectt of non-ltalian poets such as T. S. Eliot, Pound, Hardyt and Wordsworth. His sensitivity to Montalets poems and the richnffs of his literary knowledge are such that he is the first-I believe-to call to the reader's attention links between Montale's Occasioni and Goethe's fourth of his Romische Elegren and between Montalews "I morti't and Coleridgets 8Love.tt The critical comments found in this work are matched by Singh's brilliant and sensitive translation of Montale's poems and prose. Through them, he reveals himself as an artist in his own right and the reader is thus treated to a double pleasure: fine criticism and perceptive translation. By faithfully pre- serving the tone and rhythm of the original verses, this writer captures the full essence of Montalets poems in extremely clear and penetrating lan- guage. In a fashion similar to Montaletst he too constructs his translations out of the living, spoken language. His clarity is such that even the reader who does understand Italian will find it useful to refer to it for a deeper grasp and appreciation of Montalets poetry. it may also be due to this seemingly effortless translation that the reader will not readily notice Singh's expedient of placing his versions before the original ones. This unusual practice adds value to the study. The reader is not interrupted in his train of thought by being forced to switch suddenly from the reading of one language to another. The Italian version, therefore, instead of imposing itself on the readerf is presented to him during the moment of pause between one thought and another. This is a great service that Singh dispenses on Montale and perhaps it is also a way of paying tribute to this great poet. if poetry is meant to be aesthetically enjoyed and kept free from any practical consideration-as Croce would have it-Singh, by placing the burden of discussion on his own versions, allows the reader to appreciate and enjoy fully the beauty of Montale's poetry. I am in total agreement with Thomas Bergin, who states that this "is the most complete study of Montale to be found anywhere," and i would add that it is one of the most perceptive and beautifully presented discussions written on Montale. 401</page><page sequence="138">WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY A Brown, Maurice F.

Bucknell University Press, 1973.156 pp. $6.95. As the subtitle indicates, this survey of George Moore's fiction examines his subjects and style in relation to his interest in contemporary art. The conflict between the differing media of painting and writing provides a tool for dis- covering as well as evaluating how Moore applied the principles of the graphic arts to his literature. Dunleavy integrates biographical information with literary analysis in a manner that illuminates both, but her identification of Moore with his protagonists is perhaps too insistent to be truGy useful for explication. In attempting to separate biography and disputable autobiog- raphy, Dunleavy collates various versions of the anecdotes, treating all with a healthy scepticism. The major problem with this book is a question of audience. It is too superficial for the experienced student, but not basic enough for the begin- ner: there is no notation of the material from other scholars; the French is not translated; names and technical terms are insufficiently identified. The study contains a brief chronology and bibliography; the index contains only proper names, not themes. C Duckwortht Phyllis Harris. Naturalism and Romanticism in the Novels of George Moore.

In this compact and carefully unified 403</page><page sequence="140">VLADIMIR NABOKOV study Julia Bader first establishes the nature of the art novel as conceived by Nabokov, then in separate chapters shows how the six English novels from The Real Life of Sebastian Knight to Ada demonstrate the various and strange ways in which Nabokov plays "the game of artifice." A special accomplish- ment of her skilled analyses of the novels is the way in which she makes clear and almost simplifies many of the intricate puzzles and private jokes which challenge readers of the novels. She shows that Nabokov's fiction is reflexive not only in the sense that it reflects the artist, but also in the sense that it de- mands that the reader also pass through the looking glass.

FR IEDMAN, University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee 406</page><page sequence="143">Gilbert Muller begins his story study of Flannery O'Connor with this re- vealing sentence: "I have been told that Flannery O'Connor read The Pooh Perplex with glee, and that subsequently she referred to the act of criticism as the perplex business." She did not live long enough to see the perplex business directed toward her own work turn into the "industry" it now threatens to become. The first gathering of this criticism took on serious pro- portions following her death, culminating in the pamphlets of Stanley Edgar Hyman and Robert Drake and ir! the collection edited by Melvin Friedman and Lewis Lawson, The Added Dimension: The Art and Mind of Flannery O'Connor. We are probably now in the midst of the second gathering of critical attention which was started by Josephine Hendin's naughtily ir- reverent study, The World of Flannery O'Connor. The two texts which seem central to this new interest in her work are Sally and Robert Fitzgerald's 1969 compilation, Mystery and Manners: Occasional Prose, and The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor which appeared in 1971. While these two collections offer rather little new material, they tend to focus our attention in a useful way and to offer us a unique glance at the maturing of a remarkable talent. We understand from Mystery and Manners how secondary, in her mind, the critical function was: it resulted in an "occasional" gesture which produced apercus rather than final statements; it was a way of sorting out im- pressions on subjects as diverse as the raising of peacocks and the effective turning of a situation to produce a story; it was, finally, little more than an ad- dendum to her practices as a fiction writer. Despite this almost negative as- pect of Mystery and Manners, critics of O'Connor's work can ill afford to be without it. All five of the books under consideration here clearly benefit from it. The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor makes available in a single volume all thirty-one of her shorter fictional pieces. Gathered together are the nineteen stories from A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Everything That Rises Must Converge; the six stories which originally comprised her Master's thesis at the University of lowa; early versions of chapters of Wise Blood and The Violent Bear It Away; a previously uncollected story, "The Partridge Fes- tival"; and a brief section of a novel-in-progress. The arrangement is chronological according to date of composition. Thus we are allowed to see how the apprentice writer learned her craft and matured to the point of being able to write the superbly finished last stories like "Revelation" and "Judgement Day." In fact, the volume gains a kind of symmetry by beginning with "The Geranium" and ending with a later version of the same story, "Judgement Day." A close examination of the two reveals the differences in the narrative strategies of the O'Connor of 1946 and the O'Connor of 1964. This privileged glance into her workshop makes The Complete Stories indis- pensable to O'Connor critics. Unfortunately, the volume appeared too late to be of much use to the authors of the five books under discussion here. Miles Orvell offers a paragraph on it in his "A Note on Editions Used" and Dorothy Walters lists its contents in her bibliography and makes occasional oblique reference to it especially to the Master's thesis stories-in her foot- notes. But neither was able to take full advantage of its possibilities. When I spoke above of the second phase of this interest in Flannery O'Connor, I probably should have mentioned another recent sign of her critical respectability, The Flannery O'Connor Bulletin, published at Georgia College in Milledgeville. At this writing only volume one has appeared. Its 407</page><page sequence="144">FLANNERY O'CONNOR unprepossessing format and the low-keyed nature of the contributions seem precisely right for an annual which honors a writer who shied away from any form of pretense. This first issue contains four critical articles, a reminiscence, a review of Kathleen Feeley's book, some photographs, and a description of the Flannery O'Connor Collection at Georgia College. The manuscript collection, outlined by its curator Gerald Becham, should offer an interesting detour for the literary faithful who visit Andalusia, the O'Connor farm out- side Milledgeville, Georgia. Kathleen Feeley has benefited from this pilgrimage. She has been through the collection at Georgia College and has examined all the books in Flannery O'Connor's personal library. Her Flannery O'Connor: Voice of the Peacock makes its way through all of the fiction, often measuring aspects of it against passages marked by O'Connor in her own reading. Frederick Asals, in his ex- cellent review of Kathleen Feeley's book in The Flannery O'Connor Bulletin, suggests "that there are actually two books inside these covers," one "a series of 'readings' of virtually every work of fiction," the other an un- covering of her "thought." He feels that these two books never quite meet, that "the focus remains, in the end, divided." If this judgment is to be taken seriously- and I tend to believe that it should be I still cannot quite share Asals' keen disappointment. Her book does so many useful things that I can forgive Sister Kathleen her divided focus. Caroline Gordon prefaces Flannery O'Connor: Voice of the Peacock with a four-page appreciative foreword which throws accolades in the directions of both Kathleen Feeley and Flannery O'Connor. Sister Kathleen returns the favor by invoking the authority of Caroline Gordon on several crucial occa- sions. Armed with the encouragement and wisdom of Caroline Gordon on the one hand and with Mystery and Manners and the impressive resources of Flannery O'Connor's library on the other, she meets the fiction head on. Taking a cue from earlier critics, Sister Kathleen makes a good deal of the notion that "In describing the cry of the peacock, Flannery [she persists in calling her by her first name] has most aptly described her own writing." She manages, interestingly, to show how the fascination with peacocks, revealed in the opening piece in Mystery and Manners, "The King of the Birds," in- forms the fiction not only in the obvious way that the peacock is a central symbol in the long story, "The Displaced Person." Thus, for example, Kath- leen Feeley reasons with considerable perception, "Her [Flannery O'Con- nor's] mysterious attraction to strange birds that led finally to her acquisition of peacocks seems analogous to Parker's mysterious attraction to tattoos [in "Parker's Back''] that finally led to his total absorption in Christ." To show how Sister Kathleen's critical strategies work at their best, we should look closely at the first half of chapter three which is devoted to Wise Blood. The chapter begins with a letter quoted in its entirety on the conflict between faith and reason, which turned up between the pages of a book in Flannery O'Connor's library. (Kathleen Feeley's exemplary research habits helped unearth a variety of inspired jottings in O'Connor's handwriting, both on scratch paper and in the margins of her books.) Then Sister Kathleen quotes marked passages from Anton Pegis' foreword to the Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas, from de Tocqueville's Democracy in America, from volume two of Eric Voegelin's Order and History, and from Jacques Maritain's Creative Intuition in Art and Poetry all of which illustrate "the extent to which her concept of reality affected other areas of thought." 408</page><page sequence="145">After quoting from a lecture Flannery O'Connor delivered at Sweetbriar in March 1963, Kathleen Feeley finally turns to the "comic romance" Wise Blood. Her perceptions of this novel seem the keener and the shrewder for her awareness of these background texts. Among other things, she views Mrs. Hitchcock and Mrs. Flood, who appear respectively at the beginning and the end of the narrative, as " 'normal' characters [who] frame this story of spiritual 'freaks.'" This gives Wise Blood a design, accounted for by the clash between reason and faith, not generally noticed by O'Connor critics. One might be tempted at this point to liken the composition of Flannery O'Connor's first novel to the structure of a novel she much admired, Ma- dame Bovary (see Mystery and Manners). Flaubert's work is framed by a "normal" character, Charles Bovary, who is present at the beginning and end. His numbing ordinariness Flaubert, on one occasion, describes his conversation as being flat as a sidewalk-is set against the eccentricities of the other characters and helps give the novel its shape. There are certainly rougher edges in Wise Blood than in Madame Bovary, but it is interesting to note how an organizational principle they have in common offers the O'Connor novel a certain structural tidiness. Sister Kathleen also works interestingly with the plot lines of the novel and their convergence in an attempt to explain how it develops narratively. Her discussion ends with a quotation of a marked passage from Richard Chase's The American Novel and Its Tradition and an excerpt from a Flannery O'Connor lecture on the way to explaining the form of the "comic ro- mance." She finally puts the matter eloquently for Wise Blood: "Here comedy u ndercuts romance; laughter wins out." There is something a bit suspect about this approach of counterpointing the closeted reading tastes and habits of a writer with her own finished stories and novels. But somehow the method works. We seem to understand the fiction better after Katheleen Feeley has gone through these elaborate gestures. We have known for some time how much Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Romano Guardini, Henry James, and INJathaniel Hawthorne have mattered to her. But so many other writers and thinkers, like Edith Stein and C. G. Jung, now surface forcibly for the first time. We notice, for example, how Mircea Eliade's term "hierophany," used repeatedly in his great book The Sacred and the Profane, informs certain strategies in her work. (I used Eliade's concept in an essay on Flannery O'Connor's "sacred objects" which I wrote several years ago for The Added Dimension, but I did not then realize how familiar she was with both the term and Eliade's book.) Sister Kathleen, unfortunately, never gives us a list of the complete hold- ings of the library; her bibliography at the end of Flannery O'Connor: Voice of the Peacock includes only those titles she utilizes. I must echo Frederick Asals' curiosity about the rest of them and his assertion of the need for a complete catalogue. While on the subject of the bibliography, we should note that in the section called "Additional Sources" she lists only a handful of critical works. By my count there are fewer than twenty entries which might qualify as critical examinations of the stories and novels. Such talented critics of O'Connor's work as Louis Rubin, Walter Sullivan, Marion Montgomery, and John Hawkes are nowhere mentioned. There is, by the way, an error in one of these entries: the subtitle of Driskell's and Brittain's The Eternal Crossroads is The Art of Flannery O'Connor, not The Wit of Flannery O'Con- nor. We should also note before leaving Flannery O'Connor: Voice of the 409</page><page sequence="146">FLANNERY O'CONNOR Peacock that footnote 10 on p. 180 refers to a Granville Hicks review of Everything That Rises Must Converge instead of A Good Man Is Hard to Find; the 1965 date of the review should have alerted Sister Kathleen to this mis- take. One statement Kathleen Feeley makes would be looked at with suspicion by a good many critics: ". .. but Flannery O'Connor does not write alle- gory." David Eggenschwiler, for one, firmly believes she does (see especially pp. 12-13 of his The Christian Humanism of Flannery O'Connor). Eggenschwiler admits in his preface that he is intent on developing "a single thesis, that Flannery O'Connor consistently wrote from the point of view of a Christian humanist." He marshals all of his evidence in this di- rection as he closely examines the two novels and many of the stories. He manages successfully to rid her of the tag of provincialism which so many of the early commentators attached to her work. Eggenschwiler takes the epigraph for his first chapter from Allen Tate's essay in the 1930 Fugitive manifesto, /'11 Take My Stand. The most revealing sentence quoted goes like this: "The religious mind, on the other hand, has this respect; it wants the whole horse, and it will be satisfied with nothing less." This notion of the "whole horse," when applied to Flannery O'Con- nor she who had "the reFigious mind" par excellence brings out the range of her experience with a variety of disciplines and the resultant "inte- gral universe" of her fiction. Eggenschwiler proceeds to illuminate the work with help from an impressive number of psychologists, theologians, philosophers, and even poets and playwrights. He leans most heavily on Kierkegaard and Freudian psychology. Words like angst, Dionysian, fetishist, alter-ego, ero$, thanatos, animus, agon, and alazon thread their way through the text. After a while Eggenschwiler begins to emerge as one of those "inter- leckchuls" Flannery O'Connor was constitutionally ill-at-ease with. This is rather too bad because he does read the stories and novels with insight- once he brushes away the verbal cobwebs which he has allowed to accumu- late about them. One of Eggenschwiler's considerable strengths is his perseverance. He rarely leaves a story (I find him to be better with the stories than with the novels) until he has examined every last wrinkle of it. He studies in depth not only the principal characters, but also the secondary and tertiary ones. Thus he has several revealing pages on Father Flynn in "The Displaced Person" as well as on the more central figures in that long story. He is also very adept at placing O'Connor's characters on the psychiatric couch and pointing out, for example, that Hulga Hopewell and Manley Pointer ("Good Country People") are "morbid fetishists" or that O. E. Parker ("Parker's Back") is a "most obvious case of sublimated will to believe." By bringing various disciplines, like psychology, philosophy, and theology, to bear on Flannery O'Connor's work, Eggenschwiler has made us respond to its "wholeness," its "Christian humanism." He succeeds to this extent. His manner, however, seems not in concert with the wide range of his matter. There is a certain narrowness about his method which seems intent on dis- missing conflicting interpretations. He is very generous to Josephine Hendin's The World of Flannery O'Connor which he admits, in his first note, "offers the most detailed and interesting complement to my approach." But this gesture is not his usual practice. His text is liberally sprinkled with references to unnamed critics who have sinned in various ways by misinter- 410</page><page sequence="147">preting Flannery O'Connor. There are some two dozen vague allusions to "several critics," "several commentators," "a number of commentators," "some readers," and so forth. One wonders, for example, who "some readers" are who "have considered him [Tarwater] a terrifying madman and a fanatic as he went off toward the defenseless children of God, an extreme response which sacrifices the whole structure of the novel for a few isolated images but which does recognize his violent prophetic power." This habit proves annoying after a while. Eggenschwiler offers four closely printed pages of notes at the back of his book (there is no bibliography) and might have expanded this section somewhat to let us in on who these unnamed "readers," "critics," and "commentators" are. But I do not want to leave The Christian Humanism of Flannery O'Connor on this negative note. Eggen- schwiler offers some very perceptive readings of the work and analyzes O'Connor's characters with rare insight. The opening paragraph of Gilbert Muller's preface is agreeably self- effacing; he apologizes genuinely for adding to "the perplex business." We should say in fairness to Nightmares and Visions that it does not add at all to the confusion and indeed, in its modest way, should illuminate some of the remaining dark corners of Flannery O'Connor's work. Muller gets down in his opening chapter to the important matter of defining the word "gro- tesque" and distinguishing it from other terms often used interchangeably with it, like"gothic." The matter is handled with ease and dispatch, and we come away understanding a good deal about the history and possible ap- plications of the term. Muller prefixes the word Catholic to it and applies the concept neatly: "In promulgating an antidote to the absurd, Flannery O'Connor creates what properly should be termed an art of the Catholic gro- tesque. She maneuvers her characters through dark and impenetrable mazes which seemingly lead nowhere, but which unexpectedly reveal an exit into Christianity's back yard." Muller's opening chapter offers the best corrective we have to William Esty's unthinking dismissal of Flannery O'Connor's art as partaking of the "gratuitous grotesque" (see his "In America, Intellectual Bomb Shelters," Commonweal, March 7,1958, pp 586-588). Muller is very effective in suggesting large categories for considering the work. Thus he finds that many of Flannery O'Connor's stories and her two novels partake of the narrative of quest and belong to a fictional type as old as the Odyssey. In their "grotesque" and "absurd" aspects, they belong to a lineage which includes such distinguished modern fiction as Ulysses, The Castle, Lolita, As I Lay Dying, and The Tin Drum. He never views her work in a vacuum. He invariably brings it together in interesting confrontation with something else in American literature: he suggests that the family trip in "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" might be thought of as "a parody of Wilder's 'The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden' "; he thinks of Guizac in "The Dis- placed Person" as "one of the two most convincing Christ figures in American short fiction" along with Melville's Bartleby; he describes "The Artificial Nigger" as "perhaps the most perfect allegory of quest in American literature since Hawthorne wrote 'My Kinsman, Major Molineux"'; he dis- tinguishes the typical O'Connor characters from the Hemingway heroes on the basis that they "rarely seek social justification for their destructive acts." Gilbert Muller has clarified an aspect of O'Connor's work which has long been muddled and confused, and his unpretentiousness would surely have delighted her. There is little to find fault with in this readable and intelligent 411</page><page sequence="148">FLANNERY O'CONNOR study. We might point to a few lapses. In the first note to chapter one (p. 115), he calls the essay on peacocks "The King of Birds" instead of "The King of the Birds." He omits entirely footnote 5 in chapter four (bottom of p. 119); it should offer bibliographical information on W. M. Frohock's The Novel of Violence in America. He keeps misspelling the title of the final story in Everything That Rises Must Converge, "Judgement Day," throughout his text as does David Eggenschwiler, by the way. Not in the way of a lapse but of an addition, in footnote 9 of chapter three (p. 119) he mentions two at- tempts at bringing Flannery O'Connor together with Teilhard de Chardin. He might have added to the list an article better than either of the ones he cites: Marion Montgomery's "O'Connor and Teilhard de Chardin: The Problem of Evil," Renascence, XXII (Fall 1969), 3442. (Curiously enough, the Montgomery article appeared in the same issue of Renascence as an O'Con- nor study by Gilbert Muller.) I reviewed Miles Orvell's Invisible Parade in the May 1973 American Literature. A rereading of the book did not prompt me to change any of my opinions. I might reinforce the fact that Orvell is one of the few O'Connor critics who devotes much attention to style and narrative. This judgment about the use of point of view in The Violent Bear It Away is worth taking seriously: "The total effect is that of a statue being rotated on a pedestal: with each turn, the observer perceives some new plane, some new relation- ship between the planes, until at last the whole pattern takes shape in the clarity of its meaning." Orvell is also very successful in uncovering Flannery O'Connor's roots, especially in American literature. He sometimes works a bit too hard at bringing her work in close juxtaposition with that of other writers, producing rather strained effects; Gilbert Muller handles this kind of thing more effec- tively. However, he occasionally latches on to something revealing like the connection between Chaim Potok's Hasidic-oriented The Chosen, with its peculiar fanaticism, and the fanaticism which is a staple of both The Violent Bear It Away and Wise Blood. The most annoying aspect of Orvell's otherwise first-rate study is the occa- sional cuteness. He can change his accustomed serious tone quite abruptly and suddenly become very chatty: "I had not brought my camera for nothing: three clicks." Some of his stylistic effects become rather heavy- handed and wearying: " . . . whether or not Fortune [the grandfather in "A View of the Woods"] should be building a gas station qua gas station on a site that will block a view of the woods qua woods"; or "Appearing from nowhere as an allegorical agency of grace, this deus ex machina proceeds to push off the road Hazel's well-worn deus in machina, his Essex." We tend often to undervalue Twayne books because of their introductory nature and because of their rather inflexible format. The feeling is that spontaneity and originality are stifled when a critic's movements are too rigidly prescribed. Yet the first book in Twayne's United States Authors Series, Frederick J. Hoffman's William Faulkner, is one of the handful of best books we have on the Mississippi writer. Earl Rovit's Ernest Hemingway, number 41 in the series, belongs in the elite company of the pioneering studies of Philip Young and Carlos Baker. And I am speaking now of books on writers who have been more responsible for crowding our shelves of criticism than any other twentieth-century American novelists. There has, of course, always been an acknowledged place for a Twayne book on an un- 412</page><page sequence="149">known or largely ignored writer. Flannery O'Connor is neither among the most studied American writers of this century (at least not yet) nor is she among the neglected. She falls somewhere in between the Hemingways and Faulkners, on the one hand, and the Amelie Riveses on the other. Dorothy Walters, in a sense, reconfirms the versatility of the Twayne format by writing a quite effective study of a writer in this middle group. Dorothy Walters sees as central to Flannery O'Connor's art the "remarkable capacity to blend the comic and the serious in a single view of reality" on the way to realizing "Christian tragicomedy." She interestingly finds in the two novels a triadic "pattern of flight, apprehension, and capitu- lation" and sees a variation on Bergson's "snowball technique" working in many of the stories. In speaking of the "restricted ranges" of the O'Connor characters, she suggests a connection with Ben jonson's theory of "hu- mours." She restlessly tries to account for the structural, technical, stylistic, and thematic elements in Flannery O'Connor by making reference to a wide variety of earlier artistic stratagems and usually with considerable success. Walters joins David Eggenschwiler in feeling that the "fiction tends always toward allegory." She echoes Flannery O'Connor's statement from Mystery and Manners "Fiction writing is very seldom a matter of saying things; it is a matter of showing things." by insisting that O'Connor's is an "art of showing as opposed to telling." In the course of individually examining the nineteen stories from A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Everything That Rises Must Converge as well as the two novels, Dorothy Walters manages both comprehensiveness and origi- nality. She not only seems to touch all the bases, but also to come up with a startling number of fresh insights. At the same time she does not allow her obvious admiration for Flannery O'Connor to get in the way of a fair and balanced appraisal of her work. Quick to point out shortcomings, like the repetition of earlier themes and characters in the later stories giving us something of the sensation of deja vu as we turn from, say, "Good Cou ntry People" to "Revelation" she also listens attentively to the unpopular notion first expressed by John Hawkes that Flannery O'Connor "was on the devil's side." Despite O'Connor's categorical dismissal of the idea, Dorothy Walters finds it "intriguing" and explores its implications. Dorothy Walters is, clearly, not at all stifled by the Twayne format. She works within its limitations and offers a penetrating study of the fiction. Her carefully annotated bibliography of secondary sources, which follows the fairly complete list of primary material, is a reliable index to the best O'Con- nor criticism. A few lapses should be pointed out. When discussing the end of Wise Blood, Dorothy Walters refers to only a single "cop" being on the scene. Actually "two young policemen" are there. The number two has special im- portance when one recalls that two men appear to carry K. off and murder him at the end of Kafka's The Trial. There are, also, two detectives func- tioning in the last chapter of John Hawkes's The Lime Twig. Hawkes re- marked in his Sewanee Review essay on Flannery O'Connor, 88ln Wise Blood two policemen turn out to be sadistic versions of Tweedledum and Tweedledee." The Lime Twig appeared nine years after Wise Blood. Hawkes may very well have gotten the inspiration for his two detectives from O'Con- nor's two policemen, just as O'Connor may have been thinking of the last chapter of The Trial when she wrote the ending of Wise Blood. 413</page><page sequence="150">FLANNERY O'CONNOR In her discussion of "A Circle in the Fire," Dorothy Walters mistakenly speaks of "Mrs. Hopewell's daughter, Sally Virginia." Actually she means Mrs. Cope instead of Mrs. Hopewell (who functions in "Good Country People"). The confusion between the two matrons is surely understandable; there is a certain sameness about them. When Walters refers to the city Hazel Motes operates in she calls it Taulkingham instead of Taulkinham. David Eg- genschwiler turns up in the bibliography as Effenschwiler. These and other minor lapses can easily be corrected in a second printing. In the five books under discussion there is curiously little overlapping and duplication. This is especially surprising when one realizes that most of the critical attention of these commentators is directed at only nineteen stories and two novels. Most of what I have seen in these five recent books is en- couraging; there are not too many of the storm warnings of the "perplex business" which Flannery O'Connor feared might eventually obscure her work. Stephens, Martha. THE QUESTION OF FLANNERY O'CONNOR. Louisiana State University Press. 1973. 206 pp. $8.50. Reviewed by MILES ORVELL It is the fate of an eccentric writer and they don't come any more eccentric than Flannery O'Connor to foster eccentric readings. In the ten years since critics first started writing seriously about her work, attitudes have ranged from religious celebration to atheistic denunciation, with the text being de- ciphered according to myth, to image and symbol, to the Bible, to Freud, and to sheer perversity. The present study, Martha Stephens' The Question of Flannery O'Connor, may have its own eccentricities but is nevertheless a valuable contribution to criticism of the writer. Stephens is interested in how we "take," how we react to, the disasters that befall O'Connor's characters, and it is this premise which promotes the success of her reading; for O'Con- nor's work, as the author points out, is problematical chiefly in the tonal de- mands it places on the average (that is, "liberal," "humanistic") reader, de- mands created by O'Connor's own unwavering and rigorously Christian view of the world. How does the author's belief affect the making of her fiction? What attitudes toward her characters does O'Connor take and how are they expressed? When is the tonal quality of the fiction effective, and when precarious? These are the questions behind The Question of Flannery O'Connor. What fascinates Stephens is the tension between high comedy and high seriousness that marks, in her opinion, O'Connor's best work. She finds it in parts of Wise Blood, in the beginning of The Violent Bear /t Away, and at the end of the story 8'Parker's Back," among other places. She does not like the harsh and violent endings of some of the other stories, where death the crux of O'Connor's religious vision figures (or transfigures), preferring instead the relatively more compassionate, milder irony of stories like "A Temple of the Holy Ghost," "Circle in the Fire," and 8'Parker's Back," the three she analyzes in detail. Stephens well recognizes that this attitude places her among the liberal, humanistic readers whom O'Connor regarded as her most "difficult" audience, and some difficulties do indeed result. Though the 414</page><page sequence="151">novels are quite sensitively handled, Stephens responds most comfortably to the milder O'Connor; what she does not adequately come to terms with are the more violent stories, which are, after all, the more typically O'Connor. Probably, thoughw this division into harsh and mild is itself too simplistic and leaves Stephens open to misrepresenting her subject. O'Connor, ac- cording to Stephens, always held in contempt those who loved the world. But surely this does an injustice to the writer's very real sense of wonder in created life expressed rarely, granted, but chiefly because its expression is reserved for key moments in the histories of her characters, not least noticeably in a passage Stephens quotes herself (for a different purpose) from "Parker's Back": "Until IParker] saw the man at the fair [who is tattooed all over], it did not enter his head that there was anything out of the ordinary about the fact that he existed." Or consider the peacock in "The Displaced Person." Too simplistic also is Stephens's early assertion that, for O'Connor, "human beings are ugly in every way," a view that is expressly contradicted by "A Temple of the Holy Ghost" (discussed at length), where the hermaph- rodite's acceptance of his/her own freakish embodiment "God made me thisaway.... l don't dispute hit." becomes a transforming lesson for the little girl at the center of the story. These specific problems point to the larger limitation of the book: in focusing so intently on tonality, Stephens has un- necessarily narrowed her response to O'Connor's fiction, and one grows tired, not only of the repetitious opening exposition, but of the single- mindedness of the reading as a whole. Though The Question of Flannery O'Connor is not a long book, it could well have been shorter still. Having said this, I'll repeat that humanists will find it, by and large, sensitive and judicious, free of the cant that encumbers too much O'Connor criticism. (Others will find it, well, eccentric.)

PEADAR O'DONNELL. Irish Writers Series. Bucknell University Press, 1973,128 pp. $4.50. R eviewed by JANE EARL Y To write about Peadar O'Donnell is to seize all three heads of a Cerberus si- multaneously, one not guarding Hades, but standing at the forefront of Irish literature and politics. For one must grapple with the writer of six novels in the tradition of O'Flaherty and the editor of the controversial literary magazine, The Bell, with the revolutionary once described as "the greatest agitator of his generation," and finally with the personality whose "cheeky, but disarming self-confidence" continues to charm those fortunate enough to meet him in Dublin. If Grattan Freyer does not fully accomplish this difficult task, he does handle some aspects of O'Donnell with discerning skill. In discussing the novels, Freyer's criticism is judicial rather than academic, an approach which should enormously please O'Donnell, who considers all academic scholarship to be nothing more than a "bag of bones." Probably because O'Donnell's work is so little known, at least in America, the author quotes numerous passages from the novels which illustrate O'Donnell's consummate talent for vividly recreating Irish rural life with all its contradic- tions its communal solidarity and its cruelties, its gaiety and its harshness, its pagan superstitions and its deep, abiding Christian faith. O'Donnell's world is the one described in The Big Windows in which a girl from an island marries into the glen only to have the women reject her so completely that they put the "evil eye" on her and yet one in which no one will have any luxury that his neighbors cannot borrow and share. Grattan Freyer's criticism is tasteful, though cursory, the stuff upon which more extensive criticism can be based. With astonishing grace, the author weaves necessary political background into his discussions of O'Donnell's literary and political activities. We receive all the information we need about the complicated affairs of the revolution, 416 </page><page sequence="153">the civil war, the agrarian movement, the fascist upsurge of the thirties, and the "save the West" campaign of the forties, and we receive it in a lucid and engaging manner. From thffe discussions, O'Donnell emerges appropriately not as the stereotyped fanatic with eyes blazing with the vision of a united Irish Republic, but as a shrewd, purposeful man with a sound political program designed to meet the needs of the farmers, the fishermen, and the exiled workers in Britain and a man with the perseverence to work long years, suffer imprisonment, and yet never see any of his programs adopted. Since Freyer has done so much in so little space, it might be greedy of me to ask that he give us more. But Peadar O'Donnell is as much a personality as he is a writer and a revolutionary, and I find little that reveals him as the vital, witty, and enchanting man that he is. Like many Americans interested in Irish studies, I was fortunate enough to spend some unforgettable hours with him in Dublin. Then he was kind enough to meet a quite unimportant graduate student about a research project, but he was also cheeky enough, in a charm- ingly unabashed way, to dismiss all scholarship with a few well-chosen epi- thets and to urge me to become a creative writer. He was still scrappy enough to attack a couple of very young American priests for the cowardice of the Irish clergy who during the civil war sneaked through back doors to hear the confessions of excommunicated l.R.A. men. He made this outburst to these innocent priests in a completely inoffensive, even jovial manner that succeeded at the same time in being strangely serious. I remember too his complete lack of sentimentality about the cause to which he devoted most of his life. Although he shares much of the leftist ideology of James Connolly, he expressed great amusement that nowadays a hush falls over an Irish pub whenever "The Ballad of James Connolly" is sung, and said that the last time he saw Connolly, the hero was being pelted with eggs. To gain a comprehen- sive picture of O'Donnell, we must probably wait for the authorized "Life" which Freyer hopes will be forthcoming. In the meantime, Grattan Freyer has given us enough to whet our appetites for more. LIAM OtFLAHERTY A O'Brien, James H. LIAM O'FLAHERTY. Irish Writers Series.

Reviewed by SOPHUS K. WINTHER, Professor Emeritus, University of Washington As the author of the first full-length study of O'Neill -Eugene O'Neill: A Critical Study (1934) and a close personal friend of the playwright during the last fifteen years of his life, I cannot pretend to be entirely detached in my judgment of Sheaffer's admirable biography. I can only add my assent to the many reviewers and critics across the country who have already declared Sheaffer's two volumes on O'Neill to be the definitive biography. Like O'Neill, Son and Playwright (1968), this new book is based entirely on exhaustive and meticulous research. Over a period of many years, Sheaffer has searched out thousands of primary sources and examined them with critical acumen. The result is a biography that is factual and objective. Yet it is more than a mere record of O'Neill's life and career. Or. Harry L. Kozol, who served as physician-neuropsychiatrist for both Eugene and Carlotta O'Neill during the last years of their lives, has written authoritatively of Sheaffer's work that it "searches into the ultimate nature of genius. Few biographers have gone farther or contributed more towards our limited capacity to understand the nature and substance of the persons about whom they write." One way of arriving at the unique significance of Sheaffer's work is to sug- gest a comparison with another, perhaps the other great biography of a twentieth-century American writer. Mark Schorer's Sinclair Lewis was also deeply researched. He devoted at least half as many years to his task as Sheaffer did to his, and, like Sheaffer, he dealt with the realities he dis- covered and never relied on hearsay from the foyer or the barnyard. But the great difference is that Schorer traced almost every day of Lewis's life as though the facts were an end in themselves. With great skill Schorer wove the details of his subject's life into a fascinating story. His biography is cool, calculated, exciting, and humorous-as witty, entertaining, and delightful as was the eccentric character of Lewis. In spite of its emphasis on facts rather than interpretation, Schorer's biography caught the brilliant flash of a genius who measured in endlerss detail the incongruities of American culture. Sheaffer's life of O'Neill contrasts with Schorer's biography of Lewis in much the way O'Neill differed from Lewis. Sheaffer writes of a man whose life was the drama not of a tragic America, but of a tragic mankind. Venturing in the dark shadows of such a world is not a search for the details of daily experience, but a quest for motives and meanings. Thus the emphasis is not on the objective details as an end in themselves but as clues towards the understanding of an enigmatic person. As the progression from "playwright" to "artist" in the titles of Sheaffer's two volumes suggests, he is to a large extent concerned in this second volume with analyzing the plays as a revelation of the mind and spirit of the man who wrote them. OtNeill's life was his art, and the route to under- standing the man comes through the interpretation of his art. Hundreds of details are recorded along the way, some arcane and tantalizing, leading the unwary to judge by appearance rather than reality. But always at the heart of the matter is Sheaffer's emphasis on the products of O'Neillts experience, the 418 </page><page sequence="155">plays themselves, their relation to the life of the author and through him to the life of man. Sheaffer writes that O'Neill was the most autobiographicaJ of play- wrights only Strindberg may have exceeded him in this respect but, like Strindberg, O'Neill was not interested in the biography of action, but in the meaning of life or some cloudy, tortured approaches to a meaning. In seeking an answer Shaeffer reveals how in plan after plan beginning with A11 God's Chillun Got Wings to Long Day's Journey into Night and finally to The Iceman Cometh O'Neill used his own family, especially his mother/ as characters that led him into a chamber of horrors equal in passion and terror to those in the House of Atreus. Although Long Day's Journey Into Night is the easiest of the tragedies to understand, and therefore the best-liked, Sheaffer has indicated for the first time that Hickey and his wife of The Iceman Cometh provided the deepest insight into O'Neill and his mother of any of the many plays where they are represented as characters. In this play they ultimately face the final tragedy that man cannot live with his "pipe dreams," but without them he faces disillusionment and death. Hickey's long speech, probably the longest in modern drama, expresses the ultimate substance of O'Neill's view of life. The final one hundred pages of Sheaffer's book deal with the end of O'Neill's direct contact with the stage. Eugene and Carlotta moved to the gray house at Marblehead Neck, Massachusetts, where the endless pounding of the sea quieted O'Neill's nerves while it drove Carlotta near to madness. Now alone, with only rare visitors, they brooded and quarreled, and deep hates drove them to uncontrolled and fearful actions. The shadow of murder hovered over their house like the dark elms over Ephraim Cabot's home. Then came physical accidentsr accusations, insecurity,, long separations, sickness, and finally an uneasy truce. Carlotta reported that when he returned to her after his long hospitalization in New York he covered his eyes with his hands to shut out the sight of his wife. In the small hotel room where O'Neill spent his final days, he lived with sorrows, hates, and terrors of the mind, thinking of his sons, one a dope ad- dict, the other a suicide, trying to forget his daughter, whom he believed had degraded herself in her marriage, hating his wife, and waiting for the death he had so often evoked in imagination. With great dramatic skill Shaeffer makes the final months of O'Neill's life seem almost like a tragedy by O'lsleill himself. * * * Perhaps my own recollections of those declining years will be of interest. After our close association with Eugene and Carlotta while they lived in Seat- tle, my wife Eline and I visited them frequently in California and Massa- chusetts. Nearly always we stayed in their home from three days to a week at a time. No man I ever knew lived and thought so consistently on the high level of his creative ability. He was never common, but his sardonic humor was often directed towards the pretenses and stupidities of mankind. At such times he praised the Hudson Dusters of his Hell Hole days. On the occasion of our final visit at the house at Point O' Rocks Lane, "the little gray lady on a rock," as Carlotta called it, O'Neill one evening told a long, rather rambling story about Dutch Schultz and Murder Incorporated. It ended with the com- 419</page><page sequence="156">EUGENE O'NEILL ment, "If we only had Dutch Schultz now and gave him a free hand he would clean out the crooked politicians in a hurry." I added "But then we'd have Dutch in power." His answer was "Yes" followed by a long silence. One night he asked us if we had noticed the huge high pink brick-walled estate next to his house. The brick wall must have been half a block long, "Yes," I said, "Who lives there!" "No one I know" he saidJ "But Lydia Pinkham built it. That shows how true genius is rewarded." Then he sang one of the short and vulgar Pinkham ditties. O'Neill was pleased when once at the time of Desire Under the Elms I had quoted old Ephraim's remark "God's hard, He ain't easy." We sometimes made this comment in a serious vein, but perhaps more often as a joke. On this last visit shortly after he addressed the moon and asked it to fall out of the sky because "I don't need you any more," there followed a long silence. Then he said it again, "God's hard, He ain't easy," and this time it had an ominous ring. And again there was silence. The day we left he gave us typed copies of A Moon for the Misbegotten and A Touch of the Past. I was almost as moved by this as I had been when at Tao House he had let us read A Long Day's Journey Into Night. At that time he told us that only two other people had read it and that no one else would until twenty-five years after his death. Carlotta changed that. I took the bundle of typed pages of the two yet unpublished plays. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I mumbled something. He understood how I felt. He took my arm and said, "Write me about them." I did that, ex- pressing my sense of wonder at the profound tragedy in A Moon for the Misbegotten. In the other play I saw Colonel Melody as an example of what O'Neill thought of as the nature of the Irish. It seemed all the more so at that time, because on that last visit he had talked a great deal about the Irish, about the Tyrone family. As we sat on that long porch facing the Atlantic on moonlit evenings, he seemed to be filled with a longing for his ancestors. The past was very real, his past, that of his father, and his ancestors back in Ireland. He felt very close and near to them. "Straight across the Atlantic, right over there," he pointed, "is Ireland." Then he added, "My critics have never recognized how much my work is indebted to the Irish in me." I had been very aware on this visit of how much weight he had lost. His face was thin, his long, slender hands more wrinkled and bony. The only way he could still the tremors that often shook his whole body was to fold his arms firmly across his breast. But his dark eyes were as searching as ever. He looked straight at you when he spoke directly to you as a person. No one could fail to know, even at this late date, that he was searching for an answer, for your contribution. Still at that time no one looking into those eyes set in the grim, partially emaciated face could believe that his health had failed, that he was nearing the end. Both Eline and I recognized something ominous in the atmosphere. It was as though Emperor Jones were getting ready to leave his palace, to seek shelter in the forest. Yet we did not wholly believe it. Not until a year or so later when Carlotta in a long discourse over the phone gave her account of O'Neill's disaster. * * * 420</page><page sequence="157">It is no idle clichJe to write that all future students of O'Neill must first turn to Sheaffer's book. In the analysis he makes of every play in relation to the author's life he suggests new approaches to further critical studies. In that sense it is a genuinely seminal work. It is not within the province of a short review to develop that subject, yet one brief example may not be out of place. In the chapter on The Iceman Cometh Sheaffer refers to a comparison with Gorki's The Lower Depths. Sheaffer pushes the analogy no further, but it immediately suggests a striking contrast to O'Neill's play. Gorki's drama rests on an underlying faith that could the economic system be changed the outcasts of society depicted in his work could be saved. There is no salvation for the tragic characters in Harry Hope's saloon. They are at the Last Chance Bar. No hope, no escape, only the peace of death awaits them. C Anderson, Elizabeth Louise.

London: Martin Brian and O'Keeffe, 1973.134 pp. £2.50. Reviewed by MILES OR VELL Readers of the Irish fantasy At Swim-Two-Birds soon become either lost or lost in admiration. And although the latter group compose a cordial freemasonry of sorts (emblem: a self-consuming manuscript) there have al- ways been two distinct kinds of admirers: those who knew Brian O'Nolan personally and those who didn't. Timothy O'Keeffe, who was largely responsible for bringing At Swim to the surface again in 1959 after twenty years underground, has once more performed an editorial service of some magnitude by assembling a series of verbal portraits (with some poerlis and seemly photographs) by those who knew him. We outside of Dublin have been so hungry for news of the man (he died in 1966) that this volume comes as most welcome fare-even if it is more a picnic than a full sit-down banquet. Each of the four reminiscences offers a glimpse of O'Nolan, and in each he escapes being fully disclosed. The author's brother, Kevin O'Nolan (there were twelve children), sketches a childhood properly suggestive of odd things here and there in the fiction to come: the boys spoke Irish among themselves, lived in a haunted house, were taught briefly through corre- spondence courses devised by the father; Brian himself early on composed screen stories and had a darkroom in which he enlarged his interest in photography. Niall Sheridan, the model for Brinsley in At Swim, fills in the brilliant waggish college days and reveals that he himself lopped a fifth off the ungainly manuscript (an episode not in the novel). Following the 1939 publication of his masterpiece (it had a happy but limited reception amidst the kickoff excitement of World War II) O'Nolan ledf for over a dozen years, two distinct careers-one as bureaucrat in the civil service (rising to Principal Officer of the Planning Section), the other as autocrat of the breakfast table. Scholarly John Garvin, O'Nolan's friend and chief in the government, implies in his memoir the perilous threat to good government posed by the imagination (and vice versa); while John White, Features Editor of the Irish Times, discusses the evolution of O'NolaWn's column, Cruiskeen Lawn, in which, as Myles na Gopaleen, he would lecture, harangue, titillate, taunt, convulse, and bewilder the Dublin breakfast table. White is especially in- 422</page><page sequence="159">teresting on the debauche of crankiness- at times savage bitterness that captured Myles's persona in the later years. Yet what is finally elusive in all these sketches is the precise etiology by which the performing mask seemingly became the man. (His friends called him Myles; he was Myles.) Or was he, rather, the quiet, introspective, essentially private person who is also remembered in these pages. We remain, finally, at some distance from Brian O'Nolan a distance, it would seem, of his own making. Just this sense of distance is what J. C. C. Mays names in the remaining essay of the volume, a long evaluation of the writings as distinctive of O'Nolan's style: Mays describes a shift from "detachment to intolerance," or, at its best, "from fastidiousness to . . . 'scorpiousness.'" Central to O'Nolan's career, according to Mays (and he is echoed elsewhere in the volume) was the humiliating rejection of his second novel by his publisher, Longmans. (The house apparently felt it was not the book for the war years. O'Nolan always claimed the manuscript was lost, and it was only post- humously that The Third Policeman was finally published.) Coupled with this presumably embittering experience was O'Nolan's growing jealousy of Joyce's growing reputation. O'Nolan's decision to remain in Ireland, Mays claims, carried with it a moral judgment on the limitations of aestheticism (Joyce's cunning devotion to art); with Joyce's apotheosis in the 50s came O'lSolan's resentful, improbably violent denunciations of the legions of Joy- ceans especially Americans. Probably Mays is not making too much of this rivalry; but I find his comparison of Joyce and O'Nolan (the former "aesthetic," the latter "moral") somewhat forced, even inverted. And I think it equally possible that O'Nolan stayed in Dublin because he needed a living, responding audience, a society of which he could be the cynosure. In this regard, O'Nolan's career as daily humorist brought no curtailment of his genius, I think; possibly even the shorter flights of the imagination, the com- pacted fantasies hung up daily like laundry, were better suited to his talents than the longer novel form. Though Mays's essay is comprehensive and insightful, I do have quarrels here and there with it. O'Nolan's humor, Mays says, is "never cozy or tinged with self-congratulation." Almost always, I think, it is. "His is not a humor that is turned in on itself." Huh? Something surely is turned in on itself in a passage like the following from The Best of Myles: "It's fairly obvious I haven't much to say today. Sow what? Sow wheat. Ah-ha, the old sow-faced cod, the funny man, clicking out his dreary blob of mirthless trash. The crude grub-glutted muck-shuffler slumped on his hack-chair, lolling his dead syrup eyes through other people's books to lift some lousy joke." None of the essays in this volume quite uncovers the man who wrote those lines. Myles contains at the end a very useful bibliography. E O'Conaire, Breandan.

Saint-John Perse celebrates the continuity of life and relation- ship at a time of threats of extinction and social alienation. In order to convey the full power of Saint-John Perse's poems, the author concentrates upon theme, setting, and imagery and covers the work from the poet's childhood on the island of Guadeloupe to the recent poems which celebrate life in the face of death.

He is concerned with what makes the most successful plays good theatre and with the way in which Pinter occasionally succeeds in transcending the constricting features of his own style. Trussler locates five periods in Pinter's career and describes the characteristics of each period.

The author examines also those poems inspired by works of art. Although the author uses biographical information where it is relevant, she scrupulously avoids using the scanty information available about the poet's mental depression. Steiner, Nancy Hunter. A CLOSER LOOK AT ARIEL: A MEMORY OF SYLVIA PLATH. Introduction by George Stade. Harper's Magazine Press, 1973. 86 pp. $5. This brief personal memoir by Sylvia Plath's college roommate recounts their eighteen-month acquaintance, concentrating on a summer the two women spent in Cambridge following their junior year at Smith college. Steiner repeatedly stresses Plath's interpretation of their friendship as two parts of the same ego with Steiner cast as the savior during Plath's continual crises. Factual and amusing, at times too personal, the work adds little to an under- standing of Plath the writer. Much more valuable is George Stade's Introduc- tion, almost as long as the memoir itself. Building upon the paradox Steiner posits between the troubled persona of the Ariel poems and the congenial appearance Plath presented to casual acquaintances, Stade suggests and begins, through liberal use of quotations from Plath's poetry and prose, an examination of her use of opposed characters and the doppleganger.

Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972.500 pp. $21.50. Like other volumes in the Critical Heritage series, this book enables one to trace the history of an author's contemporaneous reputation by presenting selected reviews and other appraisals of his books in the order of their ap- pearance. In this instance, Editor Homberger provides in addition to the usual full index of references to individual poems, topics, and characteristics, an unusually informative Introduction. Lane, Gary, ed.

Princeton University Press, 1972.160 pp. $8. Almost from the beginnings of his poetic career Pound had a special interest in the troubadours of medieval Provense. In this specialized study McDougal shows how Pound's translations of Provencal poetry helped him develop one of the most characteristic aspects of his work the creative transformation of verse distant in time and place into peculiarly Modernist forms. In The Cantos as well as in the earlier poetry, the ordered and idealistic world of the Provencal troubadours provided Pound with a touchstone by which to measure with despair the chaos and sterility of contemporary society. Quinn, Sister Bernetta. EZRA POUND: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE POETRY. Columbia University Press, 1973, 192 pp. $8.95. Reviewed by CARROLL F. TERRELL, University of Maine Since this decade began, a number of books concerned with the life, work, and milieu of Ezra Pound have been published. In 1970 we had Hugh Ken- 428 </page><page sequence="165">ner's The Pound Era, a magnum opus of extraordinary range, speaking with many voices and echoing diverse creeds. It views the master and his great contemporaries in converse with the wise, witty, and sometimes weird, and distills the essence of the vorticist movement by being itself a vortex of the era it puts on view. In 1971 we had Discretions by Pound's daughter, Princess Mary de Rachewiltz. This book, concerned with both discretions and indis- cretions, starts as a heart-warming picture of life en famille in the high Tyro- lean meadows and ends at a heartbreaking moment for the family created by the storm surrounding the Bollingen award. The family hoped and expected the award to get Pound out of St. Elizabeth's, but it only guaranteed that his incarceration would continue. Valuable specialized studies have also appeared such as James Wilhelm's Seven Troubadours and Stuart McDougal's Ezra Pound and the Troubadour Tradition. And 1973 witnessed two important aids for the serious student: Eric Homberger's Ezra Pound: The Critical Heritage and William Cookson's Selected Prose: 1909-1965. The Homberger book amazes the reader, who discovers how much critical attitudes about the work are conditioned by ir- relevant external events. The Cookson book may either please or displease: new Poundians who are trying to assemble a library of the poet's out-of-print prose will find it a gold mine; older Poundians who have such a library will be disappointed that so much of it has appeared in collections before. Also in 1973, we were given Sister Bernetta Quinn's Ezra Pound: An Introduction to the Poetry, a book which brings a number of curious thoughts to mind, espe- cially about critics and their record of performance. The fact is, academic critics have been singularly obtuse in recognizing genius if it came clothed in new modes. Professional critics, not practitioners in the art they professed to judge, took years to recognize the transforming power and vitality of such artists as Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce, and Pound. This sad norm of performance is more true in the art of letters than in music or painting. Thus, T. W. Higginson, a non-poet, could examine some verses of Emily Dickinson and recommend that she try prose. But the practicing artist as critic has an impressive record in perceiving the value of new as well as ne- glected artists in the tradition: while the big wheels of the French Academy universally condemned Hugo and Stendhal, Chateaubriand, a practicing artist, said to Hugo at the opening of Hernani, "I am going, sir, and you are coming." And Balzac welcomed the novels of Stendhal and predicted for him a great career. Professors and critics consigned the first edition of Leaves of Grass to perdition, but Emerson, a genius as well as a poet, wrote Whitman saying, "I greet you at the beginning of a great career." One is hard put to find excep- tions to this egregious record: even Boileau and Sainte-Beuve were more often wrong than right when faced with the inventors of a new tradition. Thus Vassarion Belinsky seems to stand alone: not a novelist or a poet, but only a professional critic, he recognized early-on the genius of Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, and even Dostoyevski, while the traditionalist stood by aghast at such new-fangled writing in such outrageously formless forms. This point is important if one is to understand the polemical tone in Pound's criticism and eventually the kind of critical work he said should be listened to as well as that which should not. Sister Bernetta Quinn summa- rizes Pound's idea of good criticism tersely and well: "(a) by discussion, as in Dante's De Vulgari Eloquentia, (b) by translation, (c) by imitation of a new 429</page><page sequence="166">EZRA POUND style, (d) by way of music . . . and (e) by new composition." Sister Bernetta says, "He then proceeds to divide its uses into the thought-process ... prefacing creation . . . and excernment [or] 'seeing into' . . . for Pound an art meant for sifting out what is most valuable in the . . . Sagetribe ('tale of the tribe')." We must recall that Pound's opinions about critics were formed at a moment of extreme aridity in American letters: that period from 1890 to 1920 referred to as "The Genteel Tradition." Editors, publishers, and critics formed a phalanx which successfully delayed a vital culture from being born in the United States as well as in England for a whole generation. Since Pound had dedicated his life to help create a culture and a civilization for his country, he became more and more impatient and frustrated with the pub- lishing and educational establishment, dedicated then even more than now to maintaining the safety of the status quo. Another meaning we can assign to "excernment" is "illumination by dis- cussion"; that is, a critical analysis and explication which casts light onto a work of art and brings us closer to it. Thus, Sister Bernettats new book would have pleased Pound no end: it brings us closer to both the poet and his work. She has succeeded in one of the neatest tricks of all: writing a book that is an introduction for new students which also contains lots of new material of great interest to old hands. But this will be no surprise to Pound scholars: a student of Pound's work for many years, Sister Bernetta already enjoys an enviable position for astute and careful scholarship, illustrated in such earlier work as "The Metamorphoses of Ezra Pound" as well as a much acclaimed book, The Metamorphic Tradition in Modern Poetry. In preparation for her new work, she had free access to two invaluable collections of unpublished Pound materials: the Yale archives and the special collection at Hamilton College to which Pound himself contributed much over the years. Thus we have fascinating new insights into his relationships with such people as E. E. Cummings, Hemingway, and Robert Frost as well as a host of less well-known friends such as Mary Barnard, Marcella Spann, and @'Baldy" Bacon. Quotations from unpublished letters throw new light on crisis moments of Pound's life such as his decision to continue his famous broadcasts for pay. After he was denied a visa to leave Italy and his total income was cut off be- cause of the war, he was left only the slender income from the broadcasts. At that time he wrote, "I think I said that I have my aged parents, old man 83 yesterday; . . . well his cash WILL NOT arrive from the U.S. [now]. In fact he has only had a couple of months of his pension . . . and his reserves have run out." For those who still believe that he betrayed his country and would have done better to starve than to do so, Sister Bernetta has interesting new data. She adds to the growing accumulation of materials which show that Pound was never anti-American bvit only anti-war; he was not anti-semitic, but only anti-international bankers among whom he included historically more gen- tiles than Jews. Sister Bernetta's book gives the highlights of Pound's dramatic life and goes on to examine the formation of his poetic and aesthetic creed. She devotes two chapters to a sensitive study of his early Iyrics and his growing control over his "art and sullen craft." These are necessary steps in any in- troduction to the man and poet. But the most important part of her book is the last half which is devoted to The Cantos. Sister Bernetta shows us the 430</page><page sequence="167">bones and arteries, the very scaffolding of the poem which derives from Pound's highly developed sense of form and design. We know now that the last pages of The Cantos are implied in the first. The newly dead soldiers hearing blood-dripping weapons and lusting after the sacrificial blood in the Hell of Canto I imply the last line of the last canto, Pound's appeal to all man- kind "To be men and not destroyers." In a word, the book is put together with economy of motion and the nicest of art. Beginners with Pound as well as old hands will not want to miss it. B Pound, Ezra. SELECTED PROSE 1909-1965.

He has brought to fiction qualities which it had previously lacked: an epic breadth of vision, a metaphysical rigor and depth of thought, a symbolic richness, a Iyrical fervort and an essential Indianness of style. After a biographical introduction, Naik examines the juvenilia and discovers that even in these works the themes of East and West confrontation and the cultural estrangement of the Indian are present. Succeeding chapters examine the techniques, philosophy, and themes of the short stories and the three novels.

The biography concludes with a critical summary of Richardson's aim and achievement. E Rose, Shirley. "Dorothy Richardson: The First liundred Years: A Retrospective View."

This selection of writings arises from what are probably the best motives one could have for publishing a book. The work of Olive Shreiner seems to have inspired Thurman to the extent that he wants everyone to become ac- quainted with the South African woman who, in the late nineteenth century, championed women's rights, pacifism, and humanitarianism. Thurman's en- thusiasm is infectious and should prompt readers to examine writings such as The Story of an African Farm and Woman and Labor which were far ahead of their time. E Beeton, Richard.

We have become so accustomed to hearing creative writers complain that critics either distort their work or fail to comprehend it in any way that Senghor's preface to this critical study represents a refreshing change. The poet exclaims that B3 has exposed him; she has understood him, "and he does not know whether to rejoice or to despair." Ba makes an impressive at- tempt to define the "negritude" of Black African poetry. She deals first of all with the expression of suffering which the experience of exile and alienation occasions. Because of the pressure to assimilate which the French have exerted upon the Senegalese, this alienation has a special quality in Senghor's work. Black African poetry also derives its uniqueness from the ontology of the Africans. For them being is not static as it is for Westerners; rather it is a force. Consequently, the black man perceives the universe through a sort of physical intuition. And being so close to nature, he is inti- mately conscious of the rhythmic movement of the seasons, the oceans, the 441</page><page sequence="178">LEOPOLD SEDAR SENGHOR body, and life itself. Because of this consciousness, the black man's poetry pulsates with a tom-tom sort of rhythm. This intimacy with nature results also in an imagery which is analogical, which communicates its underlying reality by means of the senses as well as the intelligence. Following this analysis, Ba includes a fairly large selection of Senghor's poems, which she translated from French; a bibliography of Senghor's works; and a glossary of African words used in the poems.

McDOWELL, Universityoflowa In commenting on the seven books listed above, I would like to take up first the two books those by Hugo and Morgan-which consider Shaw's career in general and then proceed to the other more specialized studies. Leon Hugo is conventional in his judgments, relaxed in his presentation, and deficient in intellectual stringency. He is at his weakest when in the opening section of Bernard Shaw: Playwright and Preacher he discusses Shaw's politics, his religion and philosophy and his aesthetics. Hugo has little to say that has not already been said, and he is conventional and uninspired in his own expositions. He is not impressive, either, as an aesthetician when, for instance, he contrasts the Socratic (intellectualized) with the Christian (many-sided) man and maintains that Shaw is an example of the first and Shakespeare of the second. He presents, moreover, all too little evidence when he asserts that Shaw's intellectually conceived characters lack the independence and force of emo- tionally conceived dramatic and fictional characters. In his concluding pages on Shaw as artist-philosopher, he is not really illuminating. His discussion at this point of the function of literature is elementary. He regards the greatest literature as subserving a humanistically oriented didacticism and as ex- pressing philosophical conflicts among the characters. Shaw's plays, judged by these criteria, are, or course, great works. It is all on the obvious side. Nor is Hugo conspicuously successful as a critic of the plays. In his favor let it be said that he enjoys Shaw, and in his best pages he conveys this en- thusiasm to us. But for the most part his critical method and equipment are not impressive. He lacks a strong theoretical base, with the result that he uses the judgments of others and then proceeds to impressionistically embroider them. He is not intellectually venturesome and does little to revise the conventional appraisals of Shaw's individual works. Though he knows the plays well, he is not able to express his own discriminations with tautness and precision. His method is haphazard rather than disciplined. He is also ad- dicted to extensive plot summary and to the long quotation which he assumes will speak for itself (at one point he even admits, "I quote at greater length than is strictly necessary.") . I do not go along with many of Hugo's judgments, and I suspect that my reluctance to do so is mostly the result of the lack of evidence enlisted in their support. I for one do not fi nd intensity lacki ng in Widowers' Houses. I also regard as simplistic Hugo's interpretation of The Doctor's Dilemma in terms of Ridgeon, representing conventional society, ridding it of the dis- turbing genius. Apropos of Back to Methuselah, Hugo suggests that Shaw is a "myth destroyer" rather than a "myth-maker." No one will contest Shaw's expertise in demolition, but it seems to me that his most arresting characters (and situations) have archetypal dimensions and mythic proportions. The judgment that Tanner in his capitualtion to Ann Whitefield is engulfed in the hedonist's hell at the end of the play is, to me, inexplicable. Hugo contends that Tanner "will live happily ever after" yet realize that he is "lost and damned." If this pronouncement is true, it is true only in part. Tanner will never be placid or passive; as artist-philosopher he will, I feel, always be rest- 443</page><page sequence="180">GEORGE BERNARD SHAW less, struggling against the chains with which a conventional world would manacle himJ struggling against Ann as a symbol of this restrictive world. Hugo, moreover, sometimes begs off a bit brashly when he says, for example, that he will not disturb @the buoyance/t of You Never Can Tell by analyzing its themes. But a book by a devotee of the master can hardly be without value. Hugo redeems his work by some arresting insightst judgmentsJ and expositions. I like his view that all the characters in Mrs. Warrents Profession aret'de- prived" and that V;vie's victory has its price in IJlost humanity and blighted affections." His view that Shaw's technique in Plays Pleasant depends upon bathos rather than the inversion of normal values is refreshing. His discussion of Major Barbara is illuminating, and an insight like this one is arresting @'SQ Money and Gunpowder shall destroy poverty and the ideais that tolerated poverty in order to restore prosperity to the world.'t He is right, too, I think, in regarding the Dionysian energies, favored in the playJ as being positive in their implications and a genuine Christianity as being replete with Dionysian intensity. Hugo's judgment that, by accepting his daughter/ Undershaft brings JJa high explosivet/ into the works at Perivale St. Andrew is intriguing. This action implies that accounts between Undershaft and Barbara are not so fully settled at the close of the play as they seemed to be at the end of Act 11. The critique of Heartbreak Houses though not up to that on Major Barbara or on Caesar and Cleopatrar is also penetrating. In writing about Caesar and Cleopatra Hugo is both reasoned and persua- sive. He explores with insight the tensions in the playws first scene between Caesar/s anti-romantic mind and his romantic dispostion: Caesart the anti- romantic, has feet of clay (and a bald head) and cannot escape momentarily a romantic conflation of himself as conquering hero, a delusion which Cleopatra dissipatest hardly realizing perhaps that she is doing so. In the in- terchange between Caesar and Theodotus in Act 11, both men, Hugo thinks, are in the right, except that Caesar's style of discourse and his manner are considerably more refreshing, skepticalt and original. Hugo analyzes the sensuous properties of Shawts style in this play with authority and discrimi- nation. Caesarts wisdom is to be measured, Hugo maintains, in terms of his willingness to confront death, not evade it. And he rightly ascribes the power of the concluding scene to Shaw's masterly undercutting of Caesar's triumph: by playing on our knowledge of Caesar's imperlding death at the hands of Roman idealists, by emphasizing the ruthlessness of Rufio, and by exposing the unreformed savagery of Cleopatrats nature. If all of Hugots ex- position had reached the standard of his critique on Caesar and Cleopatra, the result would have been a book of sustained rather than of intermittent brill iance. Margery Morgan's rhe Shavian Playground is a far more substantial work than Hugo's. If his lacks substance and depth, her study, on the other handf has abundance and, at timest profundity. She compensates for a failure to assimilate her resources thoroughly by the strength of her intuitions. Her book is a miJestone in Shaw criticismf and it is so original that it ought also to have been definitive in presentation and development. Despite her unique angle of vision and her wide learningt she fails to achieve in her total dis- cussion unity and full control. She is ultimately too miscellaneous in method for her work to become standard. Clear conceptions all too often fail to emerge from her writingt and her reader is finally dissatisfied when so much 444</page><page sequence="181">learning remains in the service of a mercurial mentality. The Shavian, and perhaps the general reader, will not be able to get along without Morgan's book; but he is guaranteed to be exasperated with it as well as stimulated by it. Be it said that the book rises superior to its faults. The faults are those which a year spent in revision and rewriting would have mostly eliminated, I think. It is not often that one encounters a book on Shaw which is so re- vealing even if the ideas are sometimes undeveloped and sometimes arbi- trary. It will be long before the usefulness of her book is exhausted. It might have been among the classics of Shaw criticism; regrettably, an excessively contorted style and an essential lack of discipline interfere with its achieving such status. Her sense of the complexity of Shaw's plays, her sensitivity to their mythological and symbolic properties, and her compulsion to place Shaw against his great European forebears and contemporaries such as Nietzsche, Ibsen, and Chekhov all contribute to the formation of an im- pressive book, whatever passing reservations one may have about it. Of the two chief deficiencies in Morgan's book, the lack of a supple, readable style is the more formidable. Morgan often muffles the effec- tiveness of what she says by her graceless, wooden, awkward style, a style often so opaque as to defy one's attempts to understand what is being said. I have space to quote only two examples of her refractory prose from among the multitude present in the book: As the essential drama of Candida involved a confrontation of the author's personae as socialist and as artist by the figure of Woman, this new play was the occasion for the donning of another mask to meet the same antagonist: not quite the mask of lover-to himself john Tanner appears as a revolutionary socialist and a man of ideas-to us he is certainly a political pamphleteer and orator, but the Hell scene emphasizes what the comedy plot demonstrates: that the play turns on the fact of his sexuality and the relation to Woman that sets up, that he cannot break. For the Professor's indulgence by women has not really spoiled him. He is the lucky exception that illuminates Shaw's theme of what men have made of women by the discipline of the strap, by keeping them economically dependent and subjugated, and what such women in instinctive revenge have made of men, through the discipline of the chain. Morgan's stylistic insensitivity also prevents her from developing her ideas clearly, the second chief deficiency in her book. She all too often obscures the larger logic of her discourse by failing to develop it clearly and patiently. There are too many assertions rather than proofs of these assertions. All too frequently she allows her reader to gather for himself the implications of her arguments; but he can't be sure that his interpretation is the critic's, and he rather resents having to do what ought to have been done for him. For example, she holds that Don Juan's denunciations of Hell are an indulgence of his chief vice which makes him a true denizen of Hell. Probably the vice is his propensity for talk, but one can't be sure; and one can't be sure, either, why the propensity makes him so well adapted to the nether regions. She also asserts that the interpretation of Man and Superman which makes Tan- ner out to be a persona figure for Shaw will not do. Why won't it? the reader asks. Most readers will, I am sure, continue to think that Tanner speaks, in part at least, for his creator. In another instance, Morgan quotes a long ex- 445</page><page sequence="182">GEORGE BERNARD SHAW tract from Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy and maintains that the climax of Act 11 of Man and Superman can be related to it. But she does not let the reader know what the relationship consists of or else she presupposes that it will be clearer to him than it in fact is. She often assumes that her own possession by her subject means that the reader will divine easily what is in her mind. A further example of her allusive, elliptical writing is this statement concerning The Doctor's Dilemma: "The Victorian artist-socialist's need to reconcile the dichotomy between art and morality is reflected in the steady grasp of the scales in The Doctoros Dilemma." On reading this sentence, the reader may want to know why the Victorian thinker felt compelled to make such a reconciliation, and he may wonder, furthermore, who it is that grasps the scales Shaw? one or more of the characters? the author distanced as a . volce? Some of her interpretations are strained rather than obscure. She often pronounces obiter dicta, which the reader of Shaw wishes to challenge rather than to accept. She has not felt the need, evidently, to be persuasive at such points. She asserts, for example, that there are elements in Candida allying it to the Eleusinian mysteries of Demeter, but her elaboration of the relationships strike me as being somewhat fanciful. I fail, moreover, to see how Broadbent (John Bull's Other Island) is a Faust analogue to Larry Doyle's Mephistopheles and Nora's Marguerite. The equating of Lady Britomart Undershaft and her daughter Barbara to the Pantomime Dame and Principal Boy I do not find very helpful in interpreting Major Barbara. The judgment that Dubedat's desire to exploit women (The Doctor's Dilemma) has Shaw's approbation since women in Shaw's view sapped the intellectual energies of the Pre-Raphaelites does not convince me. The Wagnerian and Shake- spearean analogues which she finds in Heartbreak House are sometimes cogent but often tenuous (Shotover is a Prospero figure, I think, Billy Dunn is possibly a Caliban type, but Randall Utterword I find it difficult to imagine as Ariel). The linking of the horses which Ariadne Utterword casually mentions as one prime constituent of the country house with Swift's Houyhnhnms or to Blake's horses of instruction is for me an idiosyncratic rather than a com- pelling interpretation. Some of Morgan's judgments of Shaw's characters and situations I also find dubious. I do not agree with her reading of Man and Superman which ad- judges Tanner to be emasculated and intellectually defeated at the play's end. Her view that the play "is concerned with the deathliness of com- promise and the betrayal (or self-betrayal) of men through women" is only partly true. Perhaps compromise is Tanner's only recourse, but I would say that he is not happy about it; and I do not feel that he sells out intellectually. Nor can I regard Doolittle (Pygmalion) after he inherits wealth as an older John Tannerr or Mazzini Dunn (Heartbreak House) as a parallel figure to Praed (Mrs. Warren's Profession). For me there is abundant hypocrisy in Broadbent despite his innocence and his possible reluctance to admit to such hypocrisy. Yet when one makes all reservations that he can about Morgan's book, he can't but admire the author's intellectual energy and perspicacity. She provides an abundance of insights for the patient reader, and her discussions of individual plays are provocative. As an original interpreter of Shaw, she is frequently most perceptive. There are many riches in this long book. Among her stimulating judgments I choose the following from many more-at 446</page><page sequence="183">random: Vivie Warren's rejection of her mother is an abrogation of moral responsibility as she becomes an actuarial machine to serve a machine-like society; Brassbound's change to dress-clothes in the final act of Captain Brassbound's Conversion symbolizes his transformation from unauthorized pirate to the kind of pirate whom society will accept; Candida has no "divine insight" and lacks often elementary sagacity, especially as to the nature of a man's strength; Mrs. Clandon (You Never Can TelB) is unable "to live tragic experience through to the point of insight"; Tanner capitulates to Ann's feminine distrust of destruction and accepts her code which emphasizes tact and diplomacy, conformity and compromise (to his detriment, in Morgan's view); Father Keegan (John Bull's Other /sland) is a "figure out of time, whose solutions have to be worked out in time in terms of actual life"; the figures in Heartbreak House are comparable to Blake's "mythopoetic images whose cosmic relevance similarly includes a pointed political allegory." The two best discussions- and they are masterful are those of Back to Methuselah and Major Barbara. As for the "Metabiological Pentateuch," Morgan rightly considers "The Tragedy of an Elderly Gentleman" as central; and she sees the series of plays as unified by mirror images which then coa- lesce to give a composite image of mankind pitted against centuries of time. As for Major Barbara, there is much incisive commentary. Barbara she re- gards as a benison-like influence, presiding over the merging of reason and energy, "the paradox of good in evil, heaven in hell" as symbolized at the end of Act 111 in the Cusins-Undershaft alliance. At the end of Act 11 in the midst of Dionysian frenzy, Barbara's Apollonian Will, Morgan avers, holds firm. She regards the play as working toward a redemption of Christianity it- self: Christianity is reborn as a natural religion after the symbolic purging of Barbara's faith in Act 11. The elusive movement in the work is "from an Old Testament (and ancient Greek) morality of just exchange to the New Testament morality of forgiveness and love." Snobby Price is seen as a "self- justified" thief preying on Undershaft and Bodger as 8'master-thieves." In the New Jerusalem at Perivale Saint Andrew, Barbara becomes aware that "an efficient industrial society, however prosperous, is not the fulfilrnent of her vocation but her opportunity." These are only some of the shrewd observa- tions formulated in this critique, the profoundest yet written on Major Bar- bara. INor should I close without mentioning the acute analysis of late plays such as Too True to Be Good, The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles, On the Rocks, and Geneva. Morgan proves that these works, about which there is still no consensus, have much substance and are, in fact, valid subjects for discussion in any overview of Shaw as creative artist. She does much, in short, to resuscitate these plays critically and to expand thereby the outlines of Shaw's total achievement. Morgan's book is a landmark. It is so good that one can be forgiven for wishing that it were still better. Turning now to more specialized studies of Shaw, we find a division be- tween Elsie B. Adams' consideration of Bernard Shaw and the Aesthetes on the one hand and evaluations of his religious and social philosophies by Allan P. Barr and Paul A. Hummert on the other. Considering the intrinsic in- terest and the range of its subject, the Adams book can only be described as disappointing. Originally a doctoral thesis, the study ought to have had more stringent revision before publication, and Adams ought to have immersed herself more fully in her materials. There is nothing wrong about her dis- 447</page><page sequence="184">GEORGE BERNARD SHAW cussions in whole or in part, but her treatment of a complex, elusive subject is insufficient and reductive. She admits, for example, that there is more to be said about the relationship between Shaw and Ruskin and that between Shaw and Morris than she puts into her first chapter. But I still can't under- stand why she did not include a bit more than she did. She does not mention Unto This Last and Fors Clavigera, works of tremendous import. The Fors let- ters had been appearing since the early 1870s, and Shaw must have felt some of their impact after he came to London in 1876 and began trying to find his way in aesthetics and economics. Nor does she mention Shaw's own tribute to his master, Ruskin's Politics. Morris' News from Nowhere demands more than the cursory notice which Adams accords it, and the whole force that Morris exerted on Shaw, aesthetically and politically, requires fuller analysis than Adams has given it. Anyone who treats Shaw's purported aestheticism and fails to discuss the most "aesthetic" of his leanings, his passion for music, hardly understands the dimensions that his inquiry imposes. That Shaw himself in part set the stage for the nineties is a fact that we do not glean from this book. His championing of Ibsen in his famous 1891 essay and of Wagner in his influential music criticism in the World (and in The Perfect Wagnerite, 1898) were all-important in familiarizing the English aes- thetes with these towering avant-garde influences. Without his pioneering work on Ibsen and Wagner, the 1890s might have been different from the decade that we know. Shaw also did much to popularize Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, either through his plays or in his occasional writings. The art criticism and Shaw's reactions to the Pre-Raphaelite painters and to the French impressionists are slighted (even the well-known essay on Ford Madox Brown, "Madox Brown, Watts, and Ibsen," in Our Theatres in the Nineties is not mentioned). In addition, the formulation of Shaw's aesthetic is pedestrian and on the obvious side. And Adams does not explore the ten- sions existing between Shaw's view of a didactic art and his own leanings toward a purer art (revealed above all, of course, in his passion for music). As to Shaw's literary origins and sympathies, one would not guess from this book that Shaw had written appreciatively on Keats's "enchanting" lines or that he felt a close affinity to the poetry and short stories of Poe (the essays on Keats and Poe in Pen Portraits and Reviews postdate the 1890s but are valuable for formulating Shaw's aesthetic leanings). Many of Shaw's own short stories and miscellaneous sketches come from the 1880s and 1890s and are as purely "aesthetic" as the short plays which Adams does discuss. The texture, finish, and elegance of Shaw's style would argue that he may have drawn a lesson from Pater, Beerbohm, Yeats, Wilde, and the other prose stylists of the decadence. An analysis of Shaw's prose in relationship to his fin-de-siecle contemporaries is, to my way of thinking, a virtual necessity in the kind of book that Adams has chosen to write. Why not, too, some analysis of "On Going to Church" (further than the ideological) since Shaw wrote it for the Savoy? The tone and texture of the style are not far removed from those suffusing the work of other even more aesthetically self-conscious contributors to the magazine. 'On Going to Church" is one of the best per- sonal essays in the language, saved from the triviality that is the curse of this genre by the perspicuousness of Shaw's mind and by the depth of his sensi- bility. As to the presence of aestheticism in Shaw's dramas, The Philanderer, I think, owes something to the brash young men who figure in WildeEs dia- 448</page><page sequence="185">logues, plays, and fiction or in Moore's Confessions of a Young Man and something, too, to the world-weariness which these men profess. Are there not other "pre-Raphaelite" plays, too, besides Candida, plays influenced by the principles and practices of "the aesthetic movement" in England? Affinities exist, it seems to me, between the exoticism of Caesar and Cleopatra, with its carefully wrought yet decorative style, and Wilde's Sa- lome. Possibly Wilde's play is one of the prototypes for Shaw's own; or the symbolist drama, in general, may have been influential on him. The exoticism of Captain Brassbound's Conversion may also draw from these same sources. Apollodorus in Caesar and Cleopatra Adams discusses as a Morris figure, but he also seems to me to be a Wilde figure. Adams does not mention that the program for the first production of Arms and the Man at the Avenue Theatre in 1894 featured a sketch by Beardsley, as if to indicate a link between Shaw's play and the time-spirit. The exaggerated posturing of Sergius and Raina has something of the same overwrought romanticism about it that marks some aspects of Pre-Raphaelitism (or some of the absurdities that abound in Patience). Raina would also have been at home in the decor immortalized by Max Beerbohm in "1880," and her postures are those that any "Pre-Ra- phaelite lady" might have assumed. The comedy of manners was a popular form of the drama in the 1880s and the 1890s, having its early practitioners in Henry Arthur Jones, Pinero, and Sardou and Scribe (whose artificial plays Shaw derided), and reaching its culmination in Wilde. Although Shaw did not care for The Importance of Being Earnest, it is not too fanciful to see the hand of Wilde and his predecessors guiding Shaw in the creation of one of his comic masterpieces, You Never Can Tell (Wilde also appreciated Widowers' Houses, as though he could recognize in Shaw's astringency some reflection of his own). Shaw, it may be, wrote the greatest comedies of man- ners in English (Arms and the Man, Major Barbara, Man and Superman, Misalliance, Pygmalion, Heartbreak House); and the time-spirit of the 1890s as Shaw assimilated it must have had some influence on this aspect of his dramaturgy. Although Shaw ostensibly favored a didactic drama, this pen- chant may have been overemphasized by Shaw himself as well as by his critics. In his own dramatic criticism in Our Theatres in the Nineties (1895 to 1898) he favored an organic kind of drama, answerable only to its internal laws and coming close to the aesthetes' own celebration of the autonomous work of art. I am afraid that for me the analysis of Candida as a Pre-Raphaelite play is inadequate. Adams, I think, overplays the conflict between the artist-man and the mother-woman in this work, while she fails to mention other ele- ments in it that are Pre-Raphaelite. There is a claustrophobic dimension to Pre-Raphaelite art that the play admirably captures. Also in Pre-Raphaelitism woman is often conceived as a decorative adjunct as well as an ideal, though Adams presents her only as an ideal. An element of exoticism which Adams does not stress is also Pre-Raphaelite. The play in part illustrates this exoticism at the same time that it reveals the failure of a typical bourgeois home to attain it. The Pre-Raphaelite woman worship, revealed in the play, often led to a confusion between poetry and sex or sometimes between reli- gion and sex, an aspect of her subject that Adams has also scanted. The failure to see in Marchbanks a viable Rossetti analogue vitiates her analysis of Shaw's poet who has, moreover, a close affinity with Yeats (as Louis Crompton has so convincingly demonstrated in Shaw the Dramatist). Adams 449</page><page sequence="186">GEORGE BERNARD SHAW does discuss fruitfully the relationship of Shaw and Yeats when she compares Shaw's desire to escape from the flesh to a realm of pure spirit (Don Juan in Man and Superman and the Ancients in Back to Methuselah articulate this aspiration) with Yeats's kindred fervor to escape from the temporal into the eternal ("Sailing to Byzantium"). Her judgment that Morell's reliance upon rhetoric puts him more clearly than Marchbanks in the art for art's sake camp is one of the few penetrating comments in the book. It is not a completely valid judgment perhaps, but it is suggestive. The soundest part of her book is the discussion of the artist-types in the novels (this discussion and the analysis of Candida had been previously published). Here she is in fuller command of her subject and its ultimate reaches than she is elsewhere in her book. She makes the claim that Shaw is closer to the fin-de-siecle aesthetes than are his fictional artists. It is just this closeness that Adams fails to demonstrate fully and authoritatively in her book. Unfortunately, we do not gain from her ac- cou nt the realization that Shaw was subconsciously fascinated by the aestheticism which he consciously repudiated. That repudiation was expressed in large part by Shaw seeing himself as being as much a preacher as a literary artist. In Victorian Stage Pulpiteer: Bernard Shaw's Crusade, Alan P. Barr declares that he wishes "to explore in detail why Shaw was serious about his religion, how and to what extent he meant it, the form that it took, the effect it had on his other activities, and how consistently important this religious element was in his writing." A com- mendable purpose certainly, and one that justifies a book-length study to implement it. But it seems to me that Barr's book is too sketchy, too superficial, and too unfocused to accomplish his purpose. Except for Chapter 7, "The New Evangel: Creative Evolution," we have in this book less an analysis of Shaw's religion than a presentation of his personality and in- tellectual interests. It would require a larger book than Barr's, a mind more synthetic, ranging, venturesome, and thorough than his, and a mind more conditioned to the hard analysis of abstractions, to achieve his declared purpose. A deeper en- gagement with his subject than Barr's is necessary in order to analyze Shaw's mind. Part of the trouble lies in his method. He resorts too much to sec- ondary sources to carry along his argument; and he fails to analyze fully the key religious works written in drama or discursive prose. A book on Shaw's religion which fails to examine in detail the life-force plays and their appen- dages (Man and Superman, Back to Methuselah), the "Christian" plays (Androcles and the Lion, SaintJoan, and their prefaces), and The Black Girl in Search of God can hardly be said to have begun to treat Shaw's religion. Barr in his Chapter 7 is correct in what he says, but rudimentary and insufficient in his analysis of Shaw's life-force religion. The discussion is excessively abstract because too few references are made to the dramatic and fictional works which embody Shaw's philosophy in its most imaginative form. There is, for example, far more cogency in Charles A. Berstss analysis of Shaw's religious ideas in his incidental remarks on Man and Superman, Androcles, and Saint Joan in his Bernard Shaw and the Art of Drama than there is anywhere in Barr's book. The plays get short shrift, but what Barr does say about them convinces me that he has not altogether encompassed the Shavian universe. It seems to me wrong to call sainted figures like Father Keegan, Joan, and Lavinia diabolists: their religion goes too deep for it to assume the Promethean guise that it 450</page><page sequence="187">takes with Shaw's diabolians proper. The judgment that Back to Methuselah is "undoubtedly the most objectionably undigested of his propagandistic plays" is only in the most superficial sense true, if it is true at all. In Captain Brassbound's Conversion Lady Cicely Waynflete's spirit is, I would say, only in part "Christ-like." As for Major Barbara, it is inadequate to formulate an overview of the play as the one that "undoubtedly comes the closest of all Shaw's plays to presenting a happy resolution of the human condition." To regard Undershaft as superior to Barbara in the sense that he has accom- plished more than she has is again true, but only to the extent that we can regard Undershaft as the fulcrum of the play. And it is again only in a superficial and I would say highly ironic- sense that Perivale St. Andrews can be said to be a Heavenly City. Rather, the snobbery, smugness, and spiritual desiccation of its inhabitants indicate that life there is not truly "blessed." To regard the Apple Cart and "In Good King Charles's Golden Days" as decadent by virtue of "their verbal glitter, suavity, and manipulative cunning" seems to me again to be a judgment off the mark. In sum, this is a pleasant book, with some information of interest brought together in readable form. It is not a disaster, but it is too relaxed in inception and presentation to strike one as being a necessary book. It is too bad that the whole book fails to attain the level of perceptiveness that characterizes the discussion of Shaw's relationship to Nietzsche, Barr's best pages. From reading Paul A. Hummert's Bernard Shaw's Marxian Romance the impression emerges, and then solidifies, that Marxist ideas were one dominant aspect of Shaw's mind and were never far away from anything that he wrote. The book sometimes claims too much for Marx, as though Shaw's protests against Victorian morality and social institutions such as marriage were only or primarily inspired by Marx when they derived from other sources, including Shaw's own personal experience. Shaw was a Marxist, but he was not only a Marxist. Before he was a Marxist he was an eclectic; but the many-sided intellectual quality of Shaw does not come through in Hum- mert's presentation. Some of the attitudes and ideas which Hummert as- cribes to Marx Shaw could more readily have picked up from Carlyle, Ruskin, Mill, Morris, Wagner, and others. If sometimes Hummert claims too much for Marx, at others he claims too little. He does not give us a sustained ex- position of the central premises of Marx's thought, but only makes glancing references to his ideas in the seriatim discussion of about all of Shaw's plays and some of the critical prose. The result is the sporadic presence of Marx's ideas in the discussions of Shaw's individual works. The book would have been weightier and Shaw's indebtedness to Marx made plainer by a coherent resume of the main tenets of Marx's thought to which the ideas of Shaw might then have been relegated. From Hummert we perceive that Shaw's social concerns were truly over- riding, whether they were Marxist in derivation or of multiple origin. We also perceive that Shaw's best works are so complex that they support a Marxist interpretation as well as other disparate kinds of readings. His works are so multi-faceted as to be explicable not only in terms of Marx, but in those of Wagner, Nietzche, Blake, Shelley, Ibsen, Butler, Morris, Goethe, Carlyle, and Ruskin. Bernard Shaw's Marxian Romance reveals some other defects in method which derogate from its authority. Hummert fails to consider essays of social import from Platform and Pulpit, The Religious Speeches of Bernard Shaw, 451</page><page sequence="188">GEORGE BERNARD SHAW The Road to Equality, and most of the other uncollected writings. He also prefers to quote from manuscript sources in the British Museum for some works already published: "Art Workers and the State," "Look, You Boob! A Little Talk on America," and "The Rationalization of Russia" are examples. It is probably legitimate to do so, but a note ought to be made as Hummert did with "The Rationalization of Russia" to the effect that the manuscript source did achieve pubGication. What he has to say about The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism and Everybody's Political What's What is pertinent, but these masterpieces of political discourse might have been referred to more often rather than simply discussed when their chronological turn came along. Some of Hummert's judgments of Shaw's works are suspect. Because Morell in Candida is in part a target of Shaw's satire for his personal defects, there is no reason for regarding him as an ineffectual socialist. The consensus is that, intellectually, Morell has integrity and is seen sympathetically. The judgment that Keegan is a failure in John Bull's Other Island because he has not sloughed off his Irish sentimentalism and idealism is only partly, if at all, valid. The truth is, rather, that he sees so much further than anyone else that he cannot as yet get his ideas into practice. The denomination of the workers at Perivale St. Andrews in Major Barbara as enlightened proletarians is sim- plistic: because they have already appropriated many bourgeois qualities that are not altogether praiseworthy, Barbara feels that she has work yet left to do at her father's factory. Contrary to Hummert's view, Louis Dubedat in The Doctor's Dilemma is only imperfectly a saint. Doolittlets delightful con- demnation of bourgeois marriage in Pygmalion may be Marxist in origin but it is, I think, more temperamental with Doolittle in inception. Nor do I think that Higgins' radical sentiment that one's manners must be the same for ev- eryone regardless of his class is necessarily an indication that Shaw had be- come impatient with Fabian gradualism. It is not quite accurate to say that Shaw laid aside his theories of creative evolution for eighteen years after writing Man and Superman. And I would hold that Hummert's equation of the optimism (itself dubious) to be found in Back to Methuselah with Shaw's elation at the success of the Russian Revolution is, in some degree, simplistic. The analysis of Back to Methuselah and of Shaw's later writings is, on the whole, perceptive. It makes sense to regard Cain as, in part, an exponent of Capitalism. Eve is more than the voice of Marx, but in that Marx was a prophet, the identification has some point. The classless society of the long- livers in The Thing Happens has some relationship to Marxist interna- tionalism. Hummert persuasively discusses the Marxist elements in Every- body's Political What's What and the question of the relationship to society of its born leaders in The Millionairess. He also perceptively charts the ten- sions in Shaw's thought between democratic (and anarchic) individualism and authoritarian (and Marxist) statism when he writes on The Apple Cart, On the Rocks, and The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles. Hummert's book is uneven. It is useful rather than definitive. It lacks the dimension of rigor which would have made it authoritative. It remains, however, a competent first survey which will help future researchers in Shaw's social, political, and economic ideas. For the moment, it says what can be readily said on the relationship between Shaw and Marx. Rounding out this group of new books in what can only be described as a vintage period in Shaw studies are The Bernard Shaw Companion by Michael 452</page><page sequence="189">and Mollie Hardwick and Stanley Weintraub's collection of essays on Saint Joan. The Hardwick Companion is a reference book of some (but not overwhelming) usefulness. It has an extended chronology (though some of Shaw's most important miscellaneous works are not there), pedestrian synopses of the plays, a character dictionary or "who's who," a sampler of quotations (much the most interesting section, proving that Shaw said many memorable things in the 1920s and 1930s), and an account of Shaw's life. The biography is mostly correct, though I had to smile when The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism was described as short (478 big pages in the original). The Companion is not nearly so good a book as R. F. Rattray's Bernard Shaw: A Chronicle; in fact, Rattray's book should be updated and revised once the Collected Letters have been published in ful 1. Saint Joan Fifty Years After brings together scattered essays of value and insight. It is convenient, even indispensable, to have these materials assembled, though sections of some of the full-scale books on Shaw contain discussions of Saint Joan of greater worth than do some of the items re- printed here. It made sense to confine the selection principally to periodical essays, however, since the major books on Shaw are more readily available than these scattered critiques. The consensus of the essays is that Shaw said something of lasting value about Joan of Arc and wrote a classic play. The lapses in Shaw's understanding of the Middle Ages and of Joan's relationship to the forces then prevalent, cited in some of the essays, are important to know about, even if they seem less crucial than Shaw's hostile critics in- variably imply.

Grazzini devotes a great deal of space to discussing Solzhenitsyn's difficulties with and expulsion from the Writer's Union, to providing a history of the Union, and to analyzing the official So- viet attitude toward literature. Material devoted specifically to Solzhenitsyn is confined almost entirely to his public life and writings. However, it is fre- quently difficult to determine whether even the public man is a real existing person or a hero in a novel composed by Grazzini. Moody, Christopher. SOLZHENITSYN.

After reading biographies by Burnett and Wilson (see below), we still can't say, as Myra Edgerly did of Stein's description of a feather, "Yes, yes, that's it, that's a feather...." Yet Burnett's work, although meant for a juvenile audience, comes closer to capturing the personality of this complex woman. Each chapter revolves around a mot by or about Stein and with the anecdotal quality of the narrative presents little tableaus of Stein's life. There are some interesting photographs of Stein and a bibliography and index. Greenfield, Howard. GERTRUDE STEIN: A BIOGRAPHY. Crown Publishers, 1973. 152 pp. i llus. $5.95.

Here is another juvenile biography of Stein. Writing in an oddly breathless style, Wilson devotes more than two thirds of her book to the young Stein, before she left for Paris. Unfortunately, this time in Stein's life is little different from that of any sensitive young girl and out of deference to any kind of sensibility should have been glossed over as humanely as possible so that the reader could get to the real Stein- the woman, the writer, and the warm friend. 457</page><page sequence="194">GERTRUDE STEIN C Blomme, Gayle Campbell Barnes.

RICKErrS: THE SHAPING OF A NOVELIST. University of Minnesota Press, 1973. 260 pp. $12.95. Reviewed byJACKSON J. BENSON, San Diego State University Some doubt still remains as to whether John Steinbeck was a major writer or not. While there is little doubt in the minds of most critics of modern fiction that he could write very well, there is also the persistent question, did he have anything to say of lasting importance? While the generalists continue to be dubious about Steinbeck's ultimate durability, an ever-expanding group of specialists has begun to probe the foundations of his thought in an effort to find that bedrock from which they can build to restore a sagging reputation. One of the younger members of this salvation army who has joined ranks with Peter Lisca, Warren French, and a few others who have labored for years almost alone, playing their song on the frosty street corners of Eastern Es- tablishment indifference, is Richard Astro. His book, John Steinbeck and Edward F. Ricketts, is ostensibly a critical biography, examining the years of Steinbeck's close friendship with the marine biologist, Ed Ricketts. But it is even more an attempt to sift out and identify the philosophical underpin- nings of Steinbeck's fiction during his "major period," from the mid-thirties to shortly after World War II. This is one of those thoughtful, well-researched books that is perhaps a bit too specialized to gain the wide audience that it should have, so that it may accomplish less by way of conversion than by pro- viding a solid text for those already in the field, so that they may go forth and spread the word providing the journal editors will throw a page or two now and then into the tin cup. Some of the most valuable articles on Steinbeck in the past have dealt with Steinbeck's relationship to nature and natural science (for example, Frederick Bracher's "Steinbeck and the Biological View of Man" and Wood- burn O. Ross's "John Steinbeck: Naturalism's Priest"), and there is no doubt that this whole area of discussion has provided one of the major keys to much of Steinbeck's fiction. Generalist critics have often flunked @'Steinbeck" because they have not paid much attention to the complexities involved in this area. Instead, they have depended on the pony of Edmund Wilson's superficial commentary (Steinbeck assimilates "human beings to animals.... [and this] is, I believe, at the bottom of his relative unsuccess at representing human beings"). The key to the key of Steinbeck's relationship 458</page><page sequence="195">to natural science, and such related topics as non-teleological thinking, is Edward F. Ricketts. By focusing on Steinbeck's relationship with the marine biologist, on the influence of Ricketts' unpublished philosophical disserta- tions, and on the interconnecting influences on Steinbeck of such other philosophers as John Elof Boodin, Astro's book gets at the heart of what we now need to know most about John Steinbeck. For if Steinbeck does have a claim on the attention of future generations, much of that claim will be based on the fact that he alone, among well-known novelists of his time, saw man as part of an ecological whole. On the other hand, an exploration in detail of Steinbeck's philosophy can- not alone re-establish and sustain Steinbeck's reputation as a major artist- only the enduring power of his art itself can accomplish that. For that reason, I would have preferred that Astro's material was more often brought into the larger context of Steinbeck's role as artist and his struggle with the artistic process. In this connection, there is some danger here also of overemphasis both of Ricketts' role in helping to shape Steinbeck's thought and of the entire philosophical background which Astro explores. While Astro takes some pains to place Ricketts' contribution in perspective, the very focus of the book, as well as its organization, may indirectly assign more prominence to Ricketts than he deserves. This issue, however, may well be a matter of contention in the years ahead. As well as building Steinbeck up by exploring the complexity of the in- tellectual background of his work, the focus on the Ricketts influence has also been used by some not Astro to tear Steinbeck down. There are those who have gone so far as to suggest (1) that Ricketts was the true genius of the two men, (2) that Steinbeck got all his most important ideas from Ricketts, and (3) that since Steinbeck wrote most of his important fiction (ac- cording to this view) during the period when he was closest to Ricketts, that Stei nbeck was therefore almost totally dependent on Ricketts for any measure of greatness his writing may have achieved. This is all nonsense, and while Astro does not endorse such views, he mentions them and then does not refute them as vigorously as he should. One who has sought to tear Steinbeck down has been Jack Calvin (Ricketts' co-editor for the handbook, Between Pacific Tides), who seems to feel that Steinbeck was little more than an amanuensis for Ricketts (partly true for The Log from the Sea of Cortez, but wide of the mark elsewhere), a parasite who stole ideas and glory from his best friend. Such an opinion shows more spite than sense and certainly no comprehension of the role of the writer of fiction- leading me back again to my disappointment that Astro did not spend more space delineating that role in respect to Steinbeck. Of course Steinbeck "stole" from Ricketts and from everyone else he could- that's what a writer of fiction does. Furthermore, although Ricketts was cer- tainly an important source and influence, as well as a convenient sounding- board and supportive critic, he was not by any means the only important influence during those same years. There are a number of major works during the period of the friendship, such as The Grapes of Wrath, wherein the influence of Ricketts, compared to the influence of others, can be seen to be relatively small. Another area of doubt raised by Astro's handling of the Steinbeck-Ricketts relationship is in his failure to deal in any substantial degree with the possible negative aspects of Ricketts' influence. For example, I suspect that the rela- 459</page><page sequence="196">tionship, particularly at its later stages, might have led to the seduction of Steinbeck into a destructive abstractionism, possibly reflected in The Moon is Down, "The Leader of the People," The Wayward Bus, and Burning Bright. I suggest these works because I think that the full weight of Ricketts' ideas fell on Steinbeck after their collaboration on The *og (1940(1). At the same time, the relationship may also have fed Steinbeck's wrong-headed tenden- cies toward allegory and parable. While the "metaphysical games" that Astro mentions Steinbeck and Ricketts playing may have had some effect in deepening the course of Steinbeck's thought, they may have also damaged his art. Apart from these objections, which are probably more than anything ex- pressions of my own perspective of the Steinbeck-Ricketts relationship, Richard Astro's book must stand as a qualitative high tide mark in the ebb and flow of Steinbeck criticism. My reaction to the book is complicated by the fact that I know Astro and have exchanged information on Steinbeck biography with him. Nevertheless, I must say- if you will keep my bias in mind I found the book to be the best researched, most carefully written, and most original piece of long criticism to be published on Steinbeck since Peter Lisca's The Wide WorldofJohn Steinbeck appeared in 1958.

WALLACE STEVENS AND THE SYMBOLIST IMAGINATION. Princeton University Press, 1972. 154 pp. $7.50. Reviewed by /A MES J. KIRSCHKE This volume comprises a twenty-seven page "Introduction" and five chapters, all of which have appeared before. In my opinion chapters Two and Three are by far the best. Chapter Three, on Baudelaire, Mallarme and Wallace Stevens, is thoroughly informative and well-written. Chapter Two incisively shows how "much of Stevens' exuberance and glitter can be traced back to Laforgue's experiments" while intelligently contrasting these poets' knowledge of the Impressionist painters. My main cavil with this essay is its failure to discriminate between good and mediocre Stevens. I fail to see how Benamou could say, for example, that Stevens' jeu d' esprit, "Sea Surface Full of Clouds," is a poem with an "admirable fabric." 461</page><page sequence="198">WALLACE STEVENS Chapter One, "Poetry and Painting," the earliest-written essay in the collection, is generally informative, but the title of the chapter is somewhat misleading, since the article deals only with Stevens' affinities (and these are handled onZy sketchily) with Impressionism and Cubism in painting. Occa- sional scholarly and stylistic flaws are discoverable even in this early essay. Benamou, for instance, badly misquotes "Variations on a Summer Day" (misquotations of Stevens' poetry are scattered throughout the text). And there are a number of other flaws which deserve to be rapped, even were they produced by a much less experienced scholar. In this first chapter, for example, there is not even a hint of a transition between the discussion of Impressionism and the consideration of Cubism in relation to Stevens' poetry. Moreover, early in the chapter Benamou writes that Wallace Stevens, like Valery, had a "refined mental museum," diction unworthy even of a freshman theme. These tendencies to scholarly and stylistic infelicity, however, become more manifest in the last two essays and in the"lntroduction." In Chapter four ("Apollinaire") Benamou remarks, for example, that "massive evidence of one poet's influence on another must be handled gingerly. It might kill two bards with one stone." This is the kind of statement which, to some, might seem cute on the typewriter, but the comment should surely have received the editor's red pencil sometime before the article was published in hard-bound format. In Chapter five, entitled "Poetry and Alchemy," Be- namou deals with Structuralism, Jungian Symbolism, and much else that is abstruse, but in dealing with these matters, he takes the reader pretty far above the already very ethereal poetic world of Wallace Stevens. And as if to make the reading the more painful, Benamou delivers his critical theories in a manner that is perhaps best described as a "Norman O. Brown style." This (from the concluding paragraph to the last article) is a fair example: "A com- pletely new Stevens appears at the very end of his life, when he has broken the ego's will, erased the Self's projections into marriageable opposites, and is at last able to thrill at the blankness of reality." In Benamou's "Introduction" this kind of style is combined with an unsurprising (since foggy style and foggy thought are not "marriageable op- posites"; they are on a perpetual honeymoon) flaccidity, as this remark indi- cates: "Today new kinds of writing attempt to break out of the nostalgic circle, by rending the symbolic system, unseating anthropological man from his central position"; and this: "Beyond the privileged works of art that we compare, there must exist the common imaginative needs of men everywhere"; and this: "The structuralist hankers for a place of repose at the uncentered structure of structures." Elsewhere in the "Introduction" Be- namou sounds less like N. O. Brown than like Polonius, another great critical theoretician. Here is one of Benamou's arguments in defense of Structural Crit icism: One can prove the justness of a comparison only be reintegrating into the struc- ture to which it belongs each motif, image, or symbol compared, and by com- paring structures, not merely motifs, images, or symbols. The proof of each part of the system derives from the truth of the whole system. The whole truth is the truth of the whole.... "The whole truth...."? In sum, then, although it contains several generally cogent articles, this is a 462 </page><page sequence="199">very shoddily written book one that is unworthy of a critic of Benamou's distinction and one that should be hidden from the young and im- pressionable who often already have enough bad writing at their fingertips.

Kidder has treated his subject more methodically than have the many critics who found they must consider this prominent feature of Thomas' work, and he displays a thorough grasp of the Biblical content to which the poems refer. His main problem is the difficulty of applying his answers to the poetry itself. In answer to the first question, a religious life includes belief, action (words and deeds), and commitment. Thomas' active participation unfolded in "the mazes of his praise" of life in the world, whether it was God's or man's. His obligation was not even that clear; indeed, it ultimately seems an obligation to his poetry-a point few would argue with but such a commitment doesn't argue for the religious element in Thomas. The argument for Thomas' belief is the strongest one in support of the book's thesis. Although Kidder tends to discuss the religious element too narrowly- within Biblical materials he convincingly demonstrates that Thomas ultimately reached a basically Christian belief which he could state directly in his last works, after skirting such a position and constantly blending it ambiguously with other mythologies in most of his poetry. While Kidder is the first to put in perspective words such as "mystic," "sacramental," "pantheistic," and "pagan" words which have been so loosely applied to Thomas, especially in the early days when he startled the critics-he misses the fact that his own well considered definition of religious poetry doesn't fit Thomas' work as neatly as he would wish. When he introduces the three types of religious imagery referential, allusive, and thematic he demonstrates their increasing complexity persua- sively. A referential image is merely "a direct and specific reference to an identifiably Biblical person or place or thing," much as any word may refer to an object or act. The allusive image "alludes to Biblical religion in a way that may not be immediately obvious, and it often complicates the allusion by carrying other meanings, unrelated to religion, within its words." Thematic imagery depends "for its support on the remaining images and themes in the work and in other works," and in turn it becomes central to the poem. Kid- derts excellent demonstrations from "Holy Spring" show how this heirarchy of religious imagery increasingly integrates the themes which are woven into a poem or group of works. The author hopes his "analysis will illuminate obscure areas" and permit "clear distinctions between religious and non-religious matters" in other poets through his treatment of Thomas. However, he becomes so engrossed in specific and often perceptive explications, especially in the last half of his book, which treats each volume separately, that his elaborate and probable system doesn't seem so essential to understanding the poetry. The detailed discussion of the simplest kind of imagery, the referential, ac- 466 </page><page sequence="203">knowledges that "Thomas treats the Bible not as a basis for religion but as a body of mythology. It becomes a storehouse of well-known symbols and tales into which he dips from time to time" as a "frame of reference for the purpose of comparison." Though Kidder finds much greater commitment expressed through the more complex categories of imagery, the statement summarizes Thomas' often disinterested use of Biblical materials in almost all but his later poems, and even those direct expressions of belief are more hu- manistic than doctrinally Christian.

Actually only a descriptive bibliography of Vonnegut's first editions as well as a listing of his short stories, interviews, blurbs, juvenalia, and book reviews, this checklist might have left less blank spaces and empty pages and added more in- formation.

Broken into three categories, "The Public Figure," "The Literary Figure," and "The Literary Art," this collection of essays presents more Vonnegut the man and spokesman (or at least cult figure) for the late sixties than Vonnegut the artist. Thus, the articles are directed more at his relevance than his art. And for those who share his Karass, this is appropriate.

Reviewed by RICHARD H. COSTA, Texas A &amp; M University A Humanities dean who serves regularly on Woodrow Wilson selection boards told me recently that candidates from a school that some consider the Ivy League of the Southwest often come off poorly in the interviews because it is impossible to learn what they read for pleasure. Perhaps demanding schools extinguish early the Gentleman-C student who never allows the curriculum to interfere with his reading. The best way to get a fix on what the kids are reading is to examine the books left in open study carrels. At the school where I teach, the kids are opting for what George Steiner, in another connection, called "transcendence on the easy-payment plan." They read science-fiction. No other genre- literary, sub-literary, or otherwise-comes close. I mention the s-f vogue because it, more than the spate of recent biographical and critical studies on him, has brought H. G. Wells back to the Academy. It is well known that Mark Schorer's fine essay, "Technique as Dis- covery" (1948), made Tono-Bungay and Wells the scapegoats for ideas about novelistic technique that didn't coincide with Schorer's and was partly responsible for keeping Wells ignored in literature courses for two decades. Since the mid-1960s a small shelf of books from both sides of the Atlantic has served as a palliative to Schorer. "What if Wells set out to grip the imagination of the reader in other ways?" asks David Lodge in the best essay ever written on Tono-Bungay. The foregoing is a necessary preface to demonstrate the continuing resur- gence in Wells studies, a vitality to which the two books under discussion here make a worthy contribution. Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie's biog- raphy is likely to be the best record of Wells's eighty years we can expect unless Gordon N. Ray finally publishes the magnum opus he first announced twenty years ago. Jack Williamson's H. G. Wells: Critic of Progress is the first appreciation of the "Father of Science-Fiction" by a major practitioner. Al- though his own debt to Wells is caught in a squeeze between the straightfor- ward and the scholarly, it is a good enough book to wish its circulation might go beyond the 1500 copies printed by Mirage Press of Baltimore. The Mackenzie biography's major contributions are non-literary. For the first time in print the authors identify the best-known of Wells's mistresses, several of whom survive as this is written: Rebecca West, Odette Keun, 471</page><page sequence="208">H. G. WELLS Amber Reeves, Moura Budberg. Unfortunately, the biography is merely fly- paper for all sorts of details without conveying how so many women of high intelligence and extraordinary beauty could have positively welcomed a passade with this reedy-voiced pyknik. As Rebecca West put it in her review of this volume ("The Real H. G. Wells," tondon Telegraph, 6/17/73): The Mackenzies "give no explanation at all of how a plain little man with a high voice could induce a number of women, all of whom could have found pleasanter things to do, to submit to this lacerating experience. There is here only a page or two to suggest that Wells was a delightful person to be with, that his company was on a level with seeing Nureyev dance or hearing Tito Gobbi sing." Fortunately Gordon Ray's H. G. Wells and Rebecca West (Yale, 1974) has just been published: a book which promises to place that decade- long liaison in the company of Chopin-Sand of an earlier time or of Sartre- Simone de Beauvoir in our own. The Mackenzies omit hardly a detail of Wells's life-changing interlude with the Fabians which ended with his defeat by the oldguard led by Shaw and the Webbs. They also chronicle dutifully the artistic disagreement between Wells and Henry James. Yet the accounts leave the implications somehow lost in translation. The Fabian phase was a destructive excursion into the parochial which probably, more than anything else, sidetracked Wells from the path of literature into that of the polemical. The James-Wells controversy continues into our own day, a truth the Mackenzies cannot stop their day-to-day chronicle long enough to see. James, near death, turned on Wells for "loose- ness . . . the cursed fluidity of self-revelation." James deplored long narra- tives in the first person, objected to having characters "talk at" the reader. "Who would read a novel if we were permitted to write biography all out?" Wells demanded as he approached seventy. The first-person novels Wells was writing in his later years, each hero bearing a replica of a part of Wells's moral history, were early examples of the fictionalized New Journalism, in general, and the recent work of such writers as Norman Mailer, Truman Ca- pote, and loan Didion, in particular. The Mackenzies give us the painstaking record, but little of the pain of the man Richard Rees, in his book on Orwell, called the first Angry Young Man in English literature is driven home. The tone of the ingredient H. G. Wells lent to the spiritually underfed in the first third of this century-exhila- ration is not conveyed. For exhilaration, one turns to Jack Williamson, who begins H. C;. Wells: Critic of Progress by declaring that "the casual insights that illuminate [Wells's] early fiction seem truer to me than most systems of philosophy" and concludes by calling Wells "the great central figure in modern science fiction." In the 137 close-packed pages between, science fictionist Williamson, at his best, illustrates the sagacity of Borges, who once wrote that H. G. W.'s romances "will be incorporated, like the fables of Theseus or Ahasuerus, into the general memory of the species and even transcend the fame of their creator or the extinction of the language in which they were written." The trouble with Williamson's book is that it began as a Ph.[). dissertation (1962, University of Colorado) at about the time Bernard Bergonzi and W. Warren Wagar were bringing out their own revamped dissertations which stand as far superior on the ideas of Wells. Much of this book, strikingly original in the early Sixties, comes across now as a rehash, not only of Ber- gonzi and Wagar, but of later commentators. It is to Williamson's credit that 472</page><page sequence="209">he draws heavily on Mark Hillegas whose Future As Nightmare: H. G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians (Oxford, 1967) fully detected the split in Wells be- tween hope and despair and documented brilliantly the curious paradox that the most anti-Utopian writers Huxley, Zamyattin, Orwell, Golding, Von- negut have reacted against Wellsian buoyancy in imagery invented by Wells. However, page after page of display quotations, each scrupulously endnoted, too often drown out the voice of the authentic Williamson. To be sure, still another book that serves as a corrective to the until- recently prevalent notion of Wells as apostle of progress is welcome. Still, it is a bit disarming to find Williamson hooking Wells onto the coattails of C. P. Snow and his now widely discredited theory of the Two Cultures and giving more space to George Gissing than to James as Wells's antagonist in the ques- tion of art's primacy. Both of these important books come together in presenting Wells as Dar- winian and divided. The Mackenzies rightly see Wells's early study under T. H. Huxley as providing "the vital link between the evangelical beliefs in which he had been brought up and the scientific ideas which he absorbed as a student. For the remainder of his life he held those two systems together in a dynamic relationship .... Neither Darwin nor Huxley nor Wells after them ... believed that progress was inevitable .... And both Huxley and Wells were plagued by haunting doubts whether in fact it would occur." Williamson's invigorating capsules of the scientific romances and short stories this study of Wells's doubts about progress ought not to have ex- cluded Tono-Bungay, so full of mythopoeic forebodings) "show that Wells's ideas of progress were controlled from the beginning by his vision of man- kind at the mercy of a chaotic and uncaring cosmos . .. and by his ironic awareness that even the most successful evolutionary adaptations of the future world are unlikely to base themselves upon the dreams of progressive liberalism."

In The Mystery of Unity she has extended her veneration of God to other gods, to Northrop Frye primarily and to Patrick White secondarily, and she has found other Bibles in Frye's Anatomy of Criticism and White's novels. Veneration is prone to being uncritical, and that is the chief weakness in Morley's approach to White through Frye. Frye's terminology-cluttered criticism provides a clumsy method of approach to a major writer; it was perhaps to be expected that Morley would at times get lost in summary and explication of Frye and lose sight of White. So she ends by elevating a lesser figure above a greater. And although few would quarrel with the statement 475 </page><page sequence="212">PATRICK WHITE that White is a genius, who would join Morley in regarding seven of his eight (now nine) novels as great? It is this uncritical deference to Frye and White, along with the distorted scale that places a critic above a major creative writer, that deters us from acknowledging her own positive merits, like her wide and deep knowledge of myths and her thoroughness. Other than denying greatness only to the early The Living and the Dead, Morley offers no hierarchy for White's novels. One might expect some in- dication that certain works like The Aunt's Story, The Tree of Man, and Voss stand out above the others. (The Eye of the Storm, also one of White's major works, was published after Morley's study appeared.) Increasingly, one finds The Aunt's Story being named by various critics as White's masterpiece. Morley stays at the periphery of this novel, neither considering the central character Theodora Goodman in depth nor attempting to come to grips with the dazzling but difficult "Jardin Exotique" section of the book. One of the chief failures in White criticism thus far has been the failure of critics over the last quarter century to explicate The Aunt's Story, one of the great novels of our time. With her view of White's novels as unusually unified, a view that is em- phasized in her title The Mystery of Unity, Morley observes neither variance in White's creative impulse nor development in his thought. There was a pe- riod, however, following Voss (1957) and preceding The Eye of the Storm (1973), when White's genius was somewhat in recession. It is also possible now to indicate general periods in his career. His first two novels, Happy Valley and The Living and the Dead, represent his literary apprenticeship, an apprenticeship followed by three great novels in succession, The Aunt's Story, The Tree of Man, and Voss. The next two novels, Riders in the Chariot and The Solid Mandala, are mystical works, in which White turns from hu- manistic values to esoteric spiritual values. His last two novels, The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm, have been vaguely autobiographical, the first of himself, the second of his mother; they represent a mellowing in his at- titudes, an acceptance of human weaknesses and mortality itself that is lacking in his earlier work. Genius like White's undergoes repeated puberty, and White's is no more static than Shakespeare's. In the course of her study, Morley makes two observations that lessen her significance as a critic of White. The first is that "White's vision is by no means esoteric or concerned only with an elect, a spiritual elite." It is precisely his readers' awareness that White reserves illumination for the very few, chosen on highly arbitrary grounds, that has provoked much antagonism towards him. Most of us have the uncomfortable feeling that White would consign us to the nonelect. The second of Morley's observations is that a "spirit of joy ... breathes through all the novels." His novels are in fact all depressing. Values normally considered positive-friendship and love, fulfillment through sexuality or creativity are absent from his novels. It is only in his last two books that White has come to any acceptance of life: an admiration just for the ability to endure. The Mystery of Unity is important as the first book-length study of Whitets novels. There is room for more directly literary criticism of White. In this book White is made to undergo what Australian poet Bruce Beaver has called one of the painful deflowerings of the unweaned anthropological tie-ups with the myth-factory of Frye. 476</page><page sequence="213">E Docker, John.

WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS: THE AMERICAN BACKGROUND. Cambridge University Press, 1971.228 pp. $9.50. Reviewed by JACK HARDIE, Texas A &amp; M University My wary Canadian grandmother taught me never to judge a book by its cover. My grandfather, a painter and sometime professional illustrator, tried to teach me otherwise. There was a marriage! I suppose it's my way of honoring the old man's memory, to judge books his way. But again and again the books I come by, when I open and actually read them, prove him wrong. Once in a while there's an exception, however. And here in these books about William Carlos Williams are three in a row. An arrangement of magenta polygons vibrates against a deep skyblue field on the dustjacket of William Carlos Williams: The Later Poems. The abstraction expresses Mazzaro's painterly concern with chromatic effects in poetry and with the poet's uses of analytic and synthetic cubism. And if the red can be thought to stand for the poet's early work and the blue for his later (New Directions uses those two colors respectively on the jackets of Williams' Collected Earlier Poems and Collected Later Poems), then the cover is also a paradigm of this book's broadest theme the poet's search for connections "between his dream which he dreamed when he was young and the phenomenal world of his later years." The vivid red irregular shapes 479</page><page sequence="216">WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS seem an "exploded view" of something that will never fit back together. The jacket of Sankey's "Companion" to Paterson reproduces an 1840 streetmap of Paterson, New Jersey. Sankey's book charts a course through the tortuous poem and accompanies the reader noting landmarks, offering appropriate bits of history trying to keep the itinerary straight. The lines of the map have been screened to produce a grey on white effect less stark than the original. And at the end of a rather neat progression, from the polygons, through the semi-abstraction of the map, is the aerial photograph of Paterson printed on the magenta cover of Weaver's William Carlos Williams: The American Background. This book presents the background of Williams' work with what a painter would call "photographic realism"; it is a small masterpiece of sch olarly recon naissance. Nice job of work, that review, I hear my grandfather say at this point. Ma- genta! my grandmother sniffs. Plenty of books have red covers. One should say a little more, at least, at the risk of rumpling one's thesis, about the contents of these books. (Right, says the old man, taking cover behind his Rea der's Digest. ) Mike Weaver, a Lecturer in American Literature at the University of Exeter, is a modern Polybius. His book is a cultural event that deserves to be judged in terms of Williams' definition of culture: "It is the realization of the qualities of a place in relation to the life which occupies it; embracing everything involved, climate, geographic position, relative size, history, other cultures as well as the character of its sands, flowers, minerals and the condition of knowledge within its borders. It is the act of lifting these things into an ordered and utilized whole which is culture" ("The American Back- ground"). Weaver comes up short as far as climate, sands, flowers, and minerals are concerned. But the breadth and depth of his investigations into "the condition of knowledge" in this country during the poet's productive years is nothing short of astounding. Weaver has handled literally thousands of documents concerning Williams and Williams' America. His book is made highly readable, at times exciting, by his ability to trace through this Guten- berg galaxy what Williams himself called "the radiant gist." At times, in fact, Williams is only a clear lens through which Weaver examines America- which is just what Williams wanted. But Weaver also takes the deepest soundings yet of Williams the man. The legend of the kindly-cantankerous doctor-poet gives way here to an actual human being: "He championed the outlawed, the ignorant, the diseased, and the untouchable, even as he tried to 'cure' them as a doctor, because he sensed in their physical state the condition of his mind, tortured and de- formed with denials and duties." Weaver has laid the foundation for all future biographies. More important, he has rendered perspectives that are clearer, if more complex, for all of Williams' poetry and prose. Paterson, as the attempt in the poet's words "to find an image large enough to embody the whole knowable world about me," benefits particularly from Weaver's scholarship. By its heavy use of unpublished material, William Carlos Williams: The American Background emphasizes the very pressing need for the fuller editions, now in the works, of Williams' essays and letters. The evidence of much research is also contained in Benjamin Sankey's A Companion to William Carlos Williams 's Paterson. "This book," the Preface begins, "is an interpretation of Paterson, and also an attempt to supply in a convenient form some of the information that readers of the poem will find 480 </page><page sequence="217">useful." Regarding the second half of this statement, I must say I have reread Paterson with the Companion alongside and found the information useful indeed. It is not in "a convenient form," however. Sankey very carefully tracks themes, follows motifs, traces the metamorphoses of things and characters . . . But the book is not indexed. Regarding Sankey's interpretation of Patersons I must include myself among the readers who wiGl be disappointed. A bigger omission than the index, I feel, is any coming to grips with, or even any reference to, J. Hillis Miller's important essay on W;lliams in his Poets of Reality (1965). Some of Miller's ideas must be used with caution, but no other critic has taken so seriously Williams' warning that it's "easier to romanticize a thing than to understand it." For Sankey, @' 'Paterson' is the elemental city the basic land- scape on which the present city is built, and the hidden promise that the in- dustrial city thwarts." This makes two Patersons: one the equivalent of Blake's London, the other something like Blake's Golgonooza or his New Jerusalem. And Book Five of Paterson-the closest Williams does get to a romantic city, or palace, of art Sankey considers merely "an afterthought." It's no wonder Sankey's "Conclusion" is an inventory of "promises to the reader" he believes the poem has broken. Jerome Mazzaro begins where Sankey and many other readers end, with the view of Williams as a confused poet and confusing theoretician. "A foolish and ignorant man but at moments a fine stylist" was Yvor Winters' last word. Mazzaro begins too with the earlier writings, whose imagist precisions and daring language experiments usually upstage the later work. I@These early poems," he asserts, "carry in their realizations clear unconscious pat- terns, and one feels that these unconscious patterns provide them in part with their strength." It is the argument of this book that the later poems draw their strength from the unconscious (archetypal, "dream") patterns of the earlier poems. If Williams has been confused or foolish at one level, he has great integrity and power at another. As Mazzaro examines relationships both between the earlier and the later poems and between the young Williams and the oZd man he became, a large, complex portrait of the artist takes form. Central to the argument, integral to the portrait, is this text from Kora in Hell (II, 1): "Between two contending forces there may ... arrive that moment when the stress is equal on both sides so that with a great pushing a great stability results giving a picture of perfect rest." Kora itself is the effort to give such a picture of balanced tensions, as revealed by the "strict mathematical code" underlying its "random improvisations." The mathematics impresses Mazzaro deeply. "Besides a series of tensions or pair- ings," Kora and also Spring and All, "make apparent arrangements in terms of three, the least number on which a pattern may be formed. Both works consist of twenty-seven sections, subdivided into three groups of nine." (And every section of Kora is further divided into three subsections, each of which pairs off an 8'improvisation" with an italicized "interpretation.") Williams was very subtle about some of this, but no more so than Mazzaro, who builds his own book up out of duads and triads. The dominant pairing off is the early poems with the later ones. The dominant triad is the three later poems that get most of Mazzaro's attention: "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower," Book Five of Paterson, and the sequence '8Pictures from Brueghel." Keeping the early poems before our eyes, Mazzaro creates a double vision 481</page><page sequence="218">WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS whereby we see the three later poems two ways. And across this warp and woof of his five chapters he weaves a second triad of duads: Williams' ascent-descent theme, the art-life interchanges of all his work, and the masculine-feminine struggle in his sensibility. Each of these pairs of "contending forces" in the book strives for a balance or a "marriage," strives as Kora does to be "a picture of perfect rest." Like Williams himself, Mazzaro may be trying to cross-breed numerology and number theory. But according to Williams, if the integrity of any poem sometimes seems "mystical," "it is no more than the practicability of design." The dualism explicit in all these pairs is Mazzaro's rejoinder to Hillis Miller's argument that Williams achieved a post-romantic, post-dualist vision very early, and held it. A poet himself, Mazzaro knows how poems begin, how they arise from some conflict, some discrepancy how such a duad of contending forces generates a third, temporarily reconciling element-the poem. I stress Mazzaro's large design because he does not. In his individual chapters its bold lines retire behind a busy surface of interesting scholarship and close, detailed criticism. This too is part of the book's design. The ex- cellent chapter "Sex and the Williams Poem" studies a variety of the poet's "efforts through design to impose a masculine sensibility on feminine de- tail." And when Mazzaro says of Yes, Mrs. Williams that"by emphasizing de- tail to the detriment of design, the book pretends to approximate a female way of thinking," he is describing his own book as well. "Pretends to ap- proximate a female way of thinking." William Carlos Williams: The Later Poems is like a Grandma Moses painted over a Mondrian. "Feminine detail" always has an underlying design in Williams. (In fact, "a female way of thinking" as Mazzaro means it would be content without any form im- possible.) The underlying design may have many meanings, and any one of Mazzaro's ascent-descent, art-life, male-female, youth-age pairings serves as a metaphor for the others. In his first chapter, "The Man and the Dream," Mazzaro brings all the pair- ings into alignrnent with the archetype of the Wise Old Man associated by Jung with the Orphean descent. When the artist is in a hopeless or desperate situation, Jung explains, "the Wise Old Man appears in dreams in the guise of a magician, doctor, priest, teacher, professor, grandfather, or any other person possessing authority," and rescues the artist by revealing "a future state based upon hope and probability." When Williams redreams his youthful vision in his later years he becomes his own Wise Old Man. Time is obliterated, the contending forces of the youth-age pairing are reconciled in an ltm-my-own-Grandpa simultaneity. That Williams, who called Shake- speare "My Grandfather," can be our Wise Old Man is the hopeful message of William Carlos Williams: The Later Poems. Jerome Mazzaro, I thank you for this book.

The editor has selected essays written by some of the most distinguished of Yeats critics, including A. Norman Jeffares, Frank Kermode, Oenis Donoghue, M. L. Rosenthal, Balachandra Rajan, C. K. Stead, and Thomas R. Whitaker, and he has selected 486</page><page sequence="223">essays which would provide the best overview of Yeats. The articles are ar- ranged with the object of providing this overview: Part I includes studies on the relationship between Yeats's life and art; Part 11 concentrates on certain poems central to Yeats; and Part 111 broadens the scope with archetypal . . . crltlclsm.

Review pending. Webster, Brenda S. YEATS: A PSYCHOANALYTIC STUDY. Stanford University Press, 1973.246 pp. $8.95. Brenda S. Webster designates six periods in the development of Yeats's creative work which correspond to his changing emotional identity. Each chapter outlines these patterns by examining Yeats's consecutive preoccupa- tions with death and escape, obscure and dreamy mysticism, self-confident realism, disguise through an image or mask, absorption by a mask or per- sona, and the talismanic object. Readers receptive to psychoanalytic in- terpretations of literature may find Webster's assertions persuasive, but the presentation is not sufficiently rigorous to convince those readers not predis- posed to accept jargon in place of extensive textual evidence. Claiming that a play dealing with the Famine, for instance, displays the theme of oral depri- vation requires more development than that mere statement. While psychological insight can frequently increase one's understanding of an art- work, this study suffers in being reductionist and exclusionary. Yeats is surely concerned with more than an Oedipal conflict and fear of castration. Webster does not open the plays and poems to interpretation, but rather closes them as if they were but psychotic reflexes. Instead of logical proof and refutation, she simply dismisses the work of previous critics where their reading is not consistent with her hypotheses. B Cleeve, Brian, ed. W. B.
