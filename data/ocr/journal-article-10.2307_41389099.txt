<plain_text><page sequence="1">Purity and Transgression: Reflections on the Architectural Avantgarde's Rejection of Kitsch Miriam Gusevich I We must know the right time to for- get and the right time to remember, and instinctively see when it is nec- essary to feel historically and when unhistorically. Frederich Nietzsche1 Current architectural literature presents an ongoing re- examination of the problematic legacy of the Modern Move- ment, or what I refer to as the architectural avantgardě.2 This concern is so extensive and ubiquitous that it threatens to become a major obsession. One of the major problems under discussion has been the anti-historical posture of the architectural avant- garde - or in Nietzsche's words, its paradoxical will to forget - as exemplified in its rejection of any historical precedents or allusions and its demand for a tabula rasa as a precondition to the building of a rational city. This can be clearly seen, for example, in Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse (fig. 1). The validity of the current critiques of the architectural avantgarde's anti-historical project is not in doubt. The most cursory overview of our cities reveals the havoc and destruction brought about by the relentless pursuit of the new. The spectacle of unspeakable ugliness and alienation which our cities represent today is itself enough to raise a heartfelt and categorical condem-</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 . Le Corbusier, The Radiant City nation of the project of the avantgardě. But this loss of faith in the avantgardě project does not mean that its legacy can be either simply revoked or transcended. The attempt to do so leads to an untenable contradiction. To reject wholesale the project of the architectural avantgardě on conservative grounds in order to reassert traditional modes and standards betrays its own conser- vative impulse, and conversely, to accept the project of the avant- garde is to act conservatively by preserving its stance. To avoid this contradiction we are faced with the continuing need to re- trace the trajectory of the avantgardě, to re-member its will to forget. My objective in this essay - and in others to follow - is to recover what I believe is still a meaningful dimension of the architectural avantgardě: its critique of the philistine culture responsible for creating "kitsch," a critique which operates not only in the polemical writings of the avantgardě but which the work itself also embodies. This implies that we understand the project of the architectural avantgardě not as the scientifically inspired project it pretended to be, but as motivated by a revul- sion of the senses, a reaction against "kitsch" which I believe is still justified.</page><page sequence="3">92 Discourse X.l To discuss kitsch in the current "postmodern" state of affairs is a dangerous proposition: it makes one seem a snob or a prig. Moreover, and more importantly, since kitsch is a problem of taste it is an elusive phenomenon, escaping a conclusive defini- tion and characterization. Furthermore, our judgment of kitsch is subject to historical change. From our perspective today, it is difficult to appreciate what the avantgardě regarded as kitsch. In comparison with the alienation offered to us by the bastard offspring of the Modern Movement, nineteenth-century kitsch might strike us as mildly old-fashioned, quaint, cute, relatively inoffensive, and definitely more urbane. Thus to understand the avantgardě critique of kitsch we need to situate it historically as a reaction to nineteenth-century kitsch. There is, of course, something paradoxical about this task of understanding the anti-historical posture of the architectural avantgardě historically. This paradox is compounded when we recognize that the anti-historical polemics of the avantgardě re- presented in its various manifestos - such as the Futurist Mani- festo of 1914 or the Suprematist Manifesto of 1924 - is already bracketed by two historicist discourses: a. a discourse prior to the avantgardě, a pre-modernist discourse, mapping the history of architecture along a line, and like John the Baptist, anticipating the avantgarde's ar- rival as illustrated by "La Recherche du Style Nouveau" (1895).* b. a discourse immediately subsequent to the avant- garde, the modernist discourse or the Disciples' Gospel, propagating the good news and eagerly recuperating the scandal of the intended rupture within a linear schema. A history of modern architecture was fashioned into a coher- ent story: a story with a shifting beginning (the Industrial Revolution or the Enlightenment), an ever-expanding mid- dle, and an inconclusive ending with the avantgardě.4 Once a comedy celebrating the "Brave New World," since Pruitt- Igoe it has been recast with a tragic denouement. This theologically inspired modernist discourse is struc- tured on the theme of "purity," a theme exemplified in Mies van der Rohe's cryptic motto: "Less is more."5 Purity was seen as manifest in the work: the austere absence of decoration, the truth to materials, and the honest expression of the structural logic of the building all testified to the fulfillment of the quest for purity. Purity was also seen as manifest in the intellectual rigor of the avantgardě: its unsentimental functionalism, its clinical concern with health and social welfare, and, most importantly, its analytic procedures which sought to reconstruct the foundations of archi- tecture on self-evident, self-justifiable grounds without any re-</page><page sequence="4">Fall-Winter 1987-88 93 course to the authority of tradition. In the work of the avant- garde, purity of form and purity of procedure were seen as transparently related, felicitously yielding a new architecture of total lucidity and plenitude. Significantly, this search for purity served to justify the rejection of history as corrupt and the relent- less pursuit of the new. It is precisely this discourse on purity which has been in- creasingly challenged in the current postmodern discourse inau- gurated by Robert Venturi in Complexity and Contradiction .6 In this key text Venturi challenged the modernist discourse on purity by showing the complexities, ambiguities, and "contradictions" of some of the canonical works of the avantgardě and, even more, by contesting the very desirability of the quest for purity either in form or in procedure. This position was further radicalized in Learning from Las Vegas , which he coauthored with Denise Scott- Brown, and in his study of Levittown with Scott-Brown and Steve Izenour.7 Without accepting their radical polemics, it is worthwhile to acknowledge the merits of their argument. First, it brought to the fore the problem of kitsch, an issue which had been relegated to a somewhat marginal concern in the traditional discourse on "pu- rity," despite its ubiquitous presence. Second, by stating the prob- lem of "kitsch" in terms of "taste cultures," Venturi and Scott- Brown have recognized that, insofar as it is a question of "taste," architectural judgment can never be reduced to scientific claims, and insofar as it is a question of "taste cultures," the judgment of kitsch is a problem of reception: who is making thejudgment, and what cultural background they come from is a crucial issue. Third, Learning from Las Vegas conceived of "kitsch" - at least the "kitsch" of the American Strip - as a systematic structure operat- ing at different scales: the scale of the landscape, the scale of the building, and the scale of the parts or fragments of the buildings. Fourth, by framing the problem of aesthetic judgment in terms of communicative strategies, Learning from Las Vegas also, per- haps inadvertently, disclosed one of the characteristics of "kitsch," its emblematic imitation of inappropriate paradigms, and the disjunction between the banality of the emblem and the extravagance of the formal means used. If we reexamine theoretically the modernist "purist" dis- course on the architectural avantgardě from the perspective of the problem of kitsch, we can see that instead of being a marginal issue, kitsch always functioned as the unstated sub-text motivating the modernist discourse on purity: the avantgardě is pure, kitsch is the corruption, the violation, the transgression of the original purity of architecture. Kitsch functions as the radical Other of the avantgardě; the avantgardě becomes the army of the anti-</page><page sequence="5">g 4 Discourse X.l kitsch.8 In this modernist discourse, kitsch was not explicitly stressed as an issue since, given the rational cast of this discourse, the critique of kitsch was implicitly subsumed under the aegis of the scientific. In this light kitsch was interpreted as an index of the failure to fulfill the exacting scientific project imposed by the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age.9 The inadequacy of a scientific explanation to account for issues of aesthetic judgment is by now well established.10 Despite the intentions of the avantgardě and its proponents, kitsch is a problem of taste and cannot be reduced to a question of scientific instrumentality. By grounding the critique of kitsch on claims of scientific purity of either the functionalist or the rationalist vari- ety, the modernist discourse of purity has left the avantgardě in a vulnerable position; once these scientific grounds were ques- tioned, the avantgardě critique of kitsch was also threatened, a condition that Venturi and Scott-Brown have recognized and exploited in Learning from Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I believe that Venturi and Scott-Brown's conclusions are unwarranted. To rec- ognize that kitsch is a problem of aesthetic judgment does ques- tion the avantgarde's own self-understanding as a scientific en- terprise. But to expose its belief in science as "physics envy" does not automatically void their critique of kitsch.11 To believe so would preclude the possibility of any critical judgment. If we examine the structure of Venturi's and Scott-Brown's argument, we can see that their defense of kitsch operates through a simple reversal. If according to the traditional dis- course, the avantgardě is pure and kitsch is transgressive, then, by reversal, the avantgardě is seen as transgressive since it violates traditional norms and expectations, and kitsch in contrast be- comes legitimized, "purified" as popular, and on this basis more authentic and genuine. This kind of simple reversal fails to do justice to the arguments previously presented by Venturi in Com- plexity and Contradiction , where he convincingly showed how, de- spite the avantgarde's claims of purity, many canonical avant- garde works incorporated important aesthetic contradictions - or transgressions , as I prefer to call them - which contributed to their richness and complexity. More importantly, this simple re- versal shows the inadequacy of the earlier kitsch/anti-kitsch sche- ma. The simple opposition of purity and transgression only al- lows for two equally untenable options: to defend the avantgardě by reasserting the old claims of purity or to accept kitsch as legitimate, thus repudiating the possibility of any standards for judgment.12</page><page sequence="6">Fall-Winter 1987-88 95 Considering this, it is clear that a simple return to the tradi- tional discourse on purity is currently foreclosed. Yet, to reject this simplistic discourse on purity as untenable does not entail a total rejection of the avantgarde's achievements or its legitimate and justified critique of kitsch. We need to recover these dimen- sions of the avantgardě from its own "purist" self-misunder- standing. To do so, I propose to examine the avantgardě critique of kitsch not as a simple rejection or negation, but as a dialogical pattern of opposition and reciprocity.13 Avantgarde and kitsch are reciprocal because they are both effects of the processes of modernization and capitalism.14 Like the avantgardě, kitsch can be characterized as a specifically "modern" phenomenon, made possible by the combination of modern technology, mass production, and the methods of mass distribution, such as advertising and propaganda. Adorno recog- nized this reciprocity with great poignancy. As he wrote in his "Letters to Walter Benjamin": both the avantgardě and kitsch "bear the stigmata of capitalism, both contain elements of change. . . . Both are torn halves of an integral freedom, to which however they do not add up."15 As a result of this shared histori- cal frame, the works of both the avantgardě and kitsch confront new concerns and tribulations - the impact of modern technol- ogy, the issues of health, democratization, and urbanization - and to address these new problems they transformed traditional "pre-modern" norms and practices. I will examine the transfor- mation of these norms by looking at the complex dynamic of claims of purity and acts of transgression. Transgression is a highly contested term in current critical discourse. According to Foucault, "Transgression is an action which involves the limit, that narrow zone of a line where it displays the flash of its passage, but perhaps also its entire trajec- tory, even its origin; it is likely that transgression has its entire space in the line it crosses."16 If "trangression" means a violation of the law or limit, then transgression and the limit it crosses operate by virtue of a spatial metaphor: transgression is a trespassing of the boundaries which demarcate various fields and constitute a geography of cultural possibilities. Thus transgression might be seen as a re-mapping, redefining the boundaries of the forbidden and the permitted. This re-mapping often retains the traces, the shadows of the previous dispensation; without the memory of these traces, the act of transgression would lose its meaning. Trangressions do not</page><page sequence="7">Discourse X.l obliterate all boundaries, since to transgress all boundaries is impossible and meaningless; meaning depends on boundaries, on framework; the act of transgression depends on the legibility of a "frame." Since the boundaries defining the fields of possibili- ties are constituted through power, we can say that one of the objectives of transgressions is to reframe structures of power. As Foucault has taught us about the relation of Power/Knowledge, power is a dispersed, diffused system of relations, permeating all social structures.17 If power is understood in this generalized sense, then transgression of structures of power is a political act; it has political consequences either literally or symbolically. Unlike politics, aesthetic transgressions have more limited human consequences; they are small infractions in contrast to transgressions of major cultural taboos such as incest, rape* mur- der. These dangerous transgressions cannot be regarded lightly since they have drastic human consequences. Foucault, like de Sade and Bataille before him, aestheticizes transgressions which raise serious ethical questions. Foucault wants to liberate trans- gression "from the scandalous or subversive. . . from anything aroused by negative associations"18 to allow him to entertain possibilities for transgression without addressing their conse- quences. This non-commital contemplation of transgressions aestheticizes them, and anesthetizes them. The architectural avantgarde's aesthetic trangressions were interpreted in political terms by their contemporaries, who per- ceived the affinity between their iconoclastic aesthetics and revo- lutionary politics. Because of this affinity their work was spon- sored by regimes of the left in Germany, Austria, Spain, the Soviet Union throughout the 1920s; as political currents changed to the right in the 1930s they became victims of the reactionary policies instituted under Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini and Franco.19 If trangression is understood as a trespassing of culturally defined boundaries, purity can be seen as a practice of exclusion whose object is to strengthen the demarcations of these culturally defined fields. Purity and transgression understood in light of this spatial metaphor have clear architectural implications. These strategies operate literally in the context of concrete historical "spatial practices" and their effect on the shaping of the environ- ment as well as metaphorically in terms of the "spaces of repre- sentation" of power and knowledge.20 I turn next to a discussion of the operations of these strate- gies of purity and transgression and their effects on the concrete</page><page sequence="8">Fall-Winter 1987-88 97 space of the city and its "spaces of representation" in relation to both the works of kitsch and the avantgardě. h The Kitsch Architect as Taxidermist Kitsch is usually associated with knick-knacks, curios, bibelots , that assorted paraphernalia crowding the landscapes of the world and the mind. Kitsch often comes in miniature, in a small scale and range, and it is more difficult to associate with the large scale of the building and the city. In addition to the problem of scale, kitsch eludes clear definition because it is an issue of sensi- bility, and like all questions of style and taste, it is somewhat ineffable. Here I propose to define architectural kitsch as the effect on the object of operations and strategies of purity and transgression. To illustrate this dynamic, I wish to introduce an artifact from outside the domain of architecture which I regard as the epitome of kitsch: a work by the taxidermist Ploucquet of Stutt- gart "in imitation of the attitudes, habits and occupations of rational creatures''21 (fig 2). This work clearly illustrates the dual operation of claims of purity and acts of transgression. With regard to claims of purity, we may see these ermines as "rational creatures" having tea while being entertained by a piano player and served by an obsequious servant standing alert in the back. This seemingly innocuous scene conveys nineteenth-century taste par excellence . It is exceedingly sentimental and presents a mixture of the distinguished (ermine are traditionally associated with royalty) and the banal (having tea). These claims of purity are of course ideologically inscribed: taxidermy, the "art" of pre- serving the trophy after a hunt was originally an aristocratic prerogative and functioned as an index of the aristocratic way of life. As acts of transgression, we may cite, first, taxidermy itself: killing rare animals and stuffing them for exhibition; secondly, the additional "sugar coating" meant to erase the violence of the act. Thirdly, in this particular work, the boundaries of "culture" and "nature" are transgressed: nature is colonized. The effect is to naturalize, to represent as rational, natural, and inevitable the current order of affairs, just as it was presumed "natural" in that</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 2. An ermine tea-party, by the taxidermist Plouquet of Stuttgart period for the bourgeoisie to have tea. Ultimately, what makes this work of taxidermy distinctly kitsch is the repression of the violence that makes it possible to create a space of representation for ersatz traditional values. Nineteenth-century architecture, like taxidermy, exempli- fies what Nietzsche decried as the ghoulish quality of nineteenth- century sensibility, which is epitomized in the "pastiche."22 Dead forms are stuffed with new requirements and then "sugar coat- ed" so as to naturalize them, a naturalization that clearly served to ideologically legitimate the new state of affairs by adopting the mantle of the old. If the "art" of taxidermy transgresses the boundaries of culture and nature, then nineteenth-century ar- chitectural kitsch transgresses the boundaries between cultures by forcefully uprooting forms out of their context. Architecture becomes a tableau, a space for the reenactment of the coloniza- tion imposed on other historical and contemporary cultures - the exotic and the dead (Gothic, Egyptian, Byzantine), the far East (Japan and China), and the primitive (Africa and Oceania). One of the privileged public arenas for the reenactment of this colonization is the space of the World's Fairs, which is a spectacle for the display of this colonizing operation with the clear purpose of legitimizing the system of imperial colonies. This legitimation is sought through a process of "naturalization," by recontextualizing these fragments from other cultures and setting them in a "naturalized" landscape. In this space of "na- ture," "instant" traditional cities are recreated. For instance, in the French Exhibition of 1889 a new "colonial" city was recreated which was divided into four neighborhoods (Arab, Oceanic, Afri- can and Asian), each divided into streets and alleys with such names as "Le passage du Tonkin," "L'Avenue de Gabon," and "La</page><page sequence="10">Fall-Winter 1987-88 99 Rue ďHaiphong"23 (fig 3). Even natives were brought in to "decorate" their habitat.24 These various cultures are "imploded" and juxtaposed within the "naturalistic" space of the exhibition; by setting the Fair in a renaturalized landscape, both within the city and in contrast to it, these transgressive practices are con- cealed under claims of purity; these claims of purity were ex- tended to present the Fair as a symbol of universal space for peace, denying the imperialistic power which made them possi- ble. In the private sphere, one of the spaces where this reenact- ment of the process of colonization takes place is the suburban "villa." Through its various guises (Gothic, Japanese, Swiss Cha- let, the Basque cottage, and so on) the suburban house institu- tionalizes in a permanent form the mode of colonization in the space of representation which we saw in temporary form in the World Exhibitions. In the suburban villa, we also encounter claims of purity which operate ideologically: the suburban home is taken as the ideal place to protect women and children from the horrors of the city. Significantly these claims of purity operate through an act of spatial exclusion. In this case, exclusion is based on age and gender. Women and children are constituted as a separate and "marginal" category and are spatially isolated, literally margina- lized to the outskirts of the newly expanding metropolis. These transgressions - of nature, of the boundaries be- tween cultures, of age and gender - parallel the ongoing process of colonization through capital. In the West, encumbrances and restrictions on the transfer of property traditionally maintained Fig. 3. The Algerian mosques and Tunisian casbahs; African "village" (The Paris Exhibition, 1889)</page><page sequence="11">¡ QQ Discourse X. 1 the stability of the aristocratic patrimony. Once these are lifted, real estate becomes another commodity like everything else and is open to speculation. As architecture becomes a commodity, it is uprooted and becomes more and more a free-standing object with no relation to its immediate physical context, whether in the country or in the city. Historically, free standing houses existed only in the countryside and represented the wealth from an agricultural economy while houses with contiguous walls were distinctly urban and represented the wealth from commerce and industry, in short, urban life. In this context, the free standing suburban villa represents the shame of the parvenu of his urban roots and of his desire to appropriate an older aristocratic lifestyle based on land owner- ship and situated in the countryside. For this reason, suburban homes were designed to emblematically represent power like the older manorial homes. But while the manorial homes represent- ed the power embodied in landed property, rooted through gen- erations and operating through the agricultural economy, the new suburban house represents the power of an abstract entity, capital, operating through the industrially and commercially based economy. The suburban home represents the new power of capital to acquire an estate which previously could only be inherited; it represents the power of a "phantasm,'' whose pres- ence continues to haunt the house after the original inhabitants have moved on. Perhaps this accounts for the uncanny corre- spondence between the representation of the power of the "phantasm" in haunted houses and the ghoulish consumption of traditional forms in kitsch: kitsch transforms architecture into a "fetish."25 The circulation of styles thus parallels the circulation of property through the operations of capital. By transforming property into a commodity, capital reduced space to sheer instru- mentality, erasing its previous sacral attributes and creating a crisis of representation. This reduction of architecture into an instrument of capital was facilitated by the dissociation of build- ings from the uniqueness and idiosyncracies of the site and con- text. Seen in physical isolation even when in the midst of the city, the building becomes an emblematic "pastiche" representing the power of the unrepresentable. Kitsch results from the euphemis- tic denial of this reduction of the world into sheer instrumental- ity. Nineteenth-century architectural kitsch was meant to evoke</page><page sequence="12">Fall-Winter 1987-88 101 two different modes of reception corresponding to the public and the private spheres and inscribed in terms of gender. Thus in the private sphere, in domestic architecture, we encounter the flourish of a sickly sweet, highly sentimental, "schmaltzy" kitsch which was associated with the "feminine." In the public sphere, in monumental architecture, we encounter a bombastic and pomp- ous kitsch, the "style pompier" of academic work which was associated with the "masculine."26 These conditions in the city of the living are reproduced in the city of the dead. Historically cemeteries were a "churchyard" or part of a monastery and therefore were either incorporated within the city's walls or were in close proximity to the city. In the late eighteenth century, cemeteries were removed to the city's outskirts, a move justified on hygienic grounds.27 This act of purification and exclusion is accompanied by the crisis of representation characteristic of kitsch. Mausoleums and gravestones become more and more gaudy and banal; they also participate in the ongoing colonization of other exotic and dead cultures. Gothic arches and tracery, Byzantine domes and mosa- ics, Egyptian mummies and sphinxes, Roman temples with cher- ubs and harpies, Chinese scrolls all populate the city of the dead. They create a full phantasmagoria. (Neither the rich nor the poor were spared; very often, the worst examples of funerary kitsch are the wealthiest, most pretentious monuments.) As in taxidermy, this process of transgression of the boundaries of different cultures was accompanied by a process of "naturaliza- tion." Cemeteries were designed as "naturalistic" parks and be- came the paradigm for the subsequent design of suburbs and World's Fairs. To different extents (depending on the amount of capital available), we can encounter the same phenomenon in all sorts of building types - government buildings, commercial establish- ments, even houses of ill repute. They are haunted by the phan- tasmagoria of other times. This phantasmagoria is most evident when it is most anachronistic, as in, for example, the new mass produced artifacts or in the new institutions of the bourgeois order (railroad terminals, for instance). To generalize, we can say that the recurrent phenomenon of kitsch can be understood as a transgression operating in relation to claims of purity. These claims of purity have a corresponding set of concrete spatial practices operating through spatial segre- gation and exclusion: women and children, the sick and the dead,</page><page sequence="13">Ю2 Discourse X.l join the marginal and are relocated to the margins of the city, to the outskirts, each in its own sector, carefully classified. These purifying exclusions serve to establish literal and metaphorical boundaries and limits, yet paradoxically, they are also accompa- nied by the transgressions of cultural boundaries in time and in space, by the process of colonization of other cultures which we can see operating in the works of kitsch. In kitsch, this colonization of other cultures is "naturalized" in different ways. Sometimes it is literally naturalized by inserting the building in a renaturalized landscape. Most often, however, it is naturalized by evoking a particular mode of reception, one often highly sentimental and full of pathos, eager to indulge in a rush of feeling to allay the constant threat of boredom and ennui. The "naturalization" of these objects is achieved through the euphemistic repression of the act of transgression which makes them possible. This "naturalization" plays an important role in legitimizing new power arrangements by emblematic reference to older previously established power structures. Its goal is to be acceptable and to provide consolation for the experience of loss resulting from the process of modernization. hi The Work of the Avantgarde At first sight, the work of the avantgardě and its supporting rationale seem to confirm the modernist "purist" discourse of the avantgardě. This is most evident in the now infamous Athens Charter ; The Athens Charter promoted the segregation of the city into various functions: work, living and leisure; in this fashion, the Athens Charter made explicit and magnified the previously implic- it spatial practices of segregation and exclusion. In the nine- teenth-century city, especially in the capital cities of continental Europe, the spatial practice of exclusion through suburbaniza- tion was contested by the legacy of pre-modern urbanism. The dramatic urban interventions of the late nineteenth century - such as the transformation of Paris under Haussman and the building of the Ringstrasse in Vienna - did undertake spatial practices of exclusion, not by suburbanizing, but within the city limits. This exclusion "intra-muros" began to segregate</page><page sequence="14">Fall-Winter 1987-88 103 the city on the basis of function and to develop "quartiers" on the basis of income.28 These spatial practices were rationalized as purely instrumental, beyond politics; ease of transportation, hy- gienic measures and return on capital became the paramount considerations. The urbanistic proposals in the Athens Charter, under the aegis of purity, promoted these ongoing spatial prac- tices of exclusion on an even larger scale and adopted the same instrumental justification. 29 The results have been disastrous: the fate of Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis represents the tragic denouement of this vision. So much for the purity of the spatial practice of exclusion. For the avantgardě, purity also operated in the space of cultural representation through the unequivocal repudiation of "historicism," the explicit use of historical motifs. The coloniza- tion of dead cultures was rejected as ghoulish cannibalization, thus reasserting the claims of purity. The intent here is not to reassert the discourse on purity, but to disclose its complicity with acts of transgression. Nevertheless, the avantgardě did undertake transgressive operations across cultural boundaries, and these transgressions do have some kinship with the transgressive strategies constitut- ing the work of kitsch. In kitsch, the transgression of cultural boundaries through colonization has two distinct moments. First, the more or less literal reproduction of forms from other cul- tures in time and in space, the recontextualizing of forms as a whole. We might call this a paradigmatic transgression, since it involves a transfer of paradigms from one place to another. Secondly, the eclectic reuse of forms through their fragmenta- tion and their recombination into a pastiche. This "mix and match" operation might be termed a syntagmatic transgression, since it entails the transformation of the internal relations con- ventionally held within the building. These two types of trans- gression have their counterparts in the work of the avantgardě. Paradigmatic transgression has its counterpart in the use of the objet trouvé , which often has its provenance in machine-made products. Syntagmatic transgression has its counterpart in col- lage, but whereas in the collage the composition of the work is exploded, in pastiche the composition remains conventional but is imploded through the accumulation of artifacts, references, and allusions. While both the avantgardě and kitsch incorporate acts of transgression, the role of transgressions within the work and their aesthetic effects are radically different. In the nineteenth-</page><page sequence="15">1 04 Discourse X. 1 century architectural kitsch work, paradigmatic transgression - the shift of a paradigm from one context to another - is archeo- logical, appropriating forms of pre-modern cultures; it is a uto- pia of the past as a Golden Age. In the avantgardě work, there is a similar paradigm transfer, but it functions as a utopia of the future. Similarly, in terms of syntagmatic transgressions and par- ticularly in relation to the transgression of boundaries by the appropriation of the exotic, the difference between the avant- garde and kitsch is quite striking. While kitsch appropriates the exotic literally without interpretation, reducing it to a caricature and fetishizing it by "naturalizing" it, the avantgardě incorpo- rates the exotic as a means of subverting the traditional Western modes of composition and representation. We may give as an example of the latter the appropriation of what was taken, variously, by the architectural avantgardě and kitsch as Japanese. In kitsch, the space remains a conventional Western construct - symmetrical, enclosed, and static - and is imploded by the proliferation of Japanese bibelots (miniatures, fans, lamps, and so forth). Japanese motifs appear in the design of wallpaper, furniture, even in chimneys! In contrast, in the architectural avantgardě, Japanese precedents function as an alternative mode of spatial organization, which serves to explode Fig. 4. Pietre Chareau, La Maison de Verre</page><page sequence="16">Fall-Winter 1987-88 105 the boundaries of conventional space. A perfect instance of this is La Maison de Verre, designed by Pierre Chareau (fig 4). According to Kenneth Frampton, La Maison de Verre exhibits "a passion for Japanese culture, evident in the red oxide finish to the interior steel and the liberal use of black lacquer."30 The Japanese quali- ties of the house are both denoted through these explicit cultural references, and they are connoted through more elusive means, such as the open spatial arrangement of the interior and the quality of the light filtered by the glass block which evokes the light filtered through traditional Japanese shoji screens. In the modernist discourse on the architectural avantgardě, the avantgardě is credited with the original appropriation of the exotic for aesthetic purposes; as this discussion shows, the avant- garde appropriation of exotic cultures is not "original," since this mode of colonization had been going on in Western culture in kitsch form throughout the nineteenth and even as far back as the eighteenth century.31 What is striking and original here is the way in which these transgressions operate and their aesthetic effects; this is also exemplified in the appropriation of the "primitive." The "primitive" was appropriated by some of the members of the architectural avantgardě via Cubism. African masks and artifacts sometimes appear in avantgardě interiors as a decora- tive theme; more suggestive, however, is the impact of the "primi- tive" within the structure of the work itself, most evident in the work of Le Corbusier, where traces of the primitive mask devel- oped through the exploitation of the "free-plan." In the free plan, the structural frame of the building oper- ates independently of the partition walls. In many of the houses designed by Le Corbusier, the structural frame is designed as a completely neutral, non-hierarchical grid. This rational Carte- sian framework established by the structure is transgressed through the intrusion of distorted anthropomorphic forms with close kinship to primitive masks. This mask is not literally repre- sented in the elevation, rather it operates surreptitiously in plan; it is shattered into fragments and operates as a palimpsest myste- riously guiding the location of the walls. The space implied by this grid, neutral and of infinite extension, is dislocated, a disloca- tion induced by the atavistic forms of the mask. The effect is to create within the rational space of the grid a violent juxtaposition of perplexing spaces, full of mystery and ecstatic provocation; as examples we may cite the Villa Stein at Garches, Villa Savoye at Poissy, and the Centroysus complex in Moscow.</page><page sequence="17">1 ()6 Discourse X. 1 Rather than a simple fetish, the mask here serves to subvert the order of reason, not in its literal representation, but through its spatial implications. This tension between the order of reason represented by modern technology - which makes the free-plan possible - and the traces of the primitive in the plan is exploited by Le Corbusier with irony and wit: the engineer is a noble savage.32 IV We may invoke Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and in particular his drawings from the 1760s, as a préfiguration of this problem of collage and pastiche. Piranesi is best known for his views of Rome, and those remarkable, awesome images of prisons in the Carceri series, images which have long been regarded as a prede- cessor of modern architecture.33 Less well known - and for good reason - are his designs for clocks, chimneys, and other paraphernalia of contemporary life which are the epitome of what later, in the nineteenth-century, was to become typical kitsch (fig. 5). The most extravagant drawings are his polemical pro-Egyp- tian and pro-Tuscan, and anti-Greek designs.34 Here, the com- position remains conventional, symmetrical with a clear hierar- chy, yet it is "imploded" by the incongruous juxtaposition of ornament, without rhyme or reason. As in other pastiches de- signed by Piranesi, we are witnessing a series of transgressions of the structural integrity of the frame through the proliferation of ornament resulting in a pastiche. This implosion of the frame in a pastiche is representative of the dynamics of purity and trans- gression: purity, because it seeks to retain the traditional hierar- chical modes of composition; transgression, because all the con- ventions of the classical vocabulary are willfully violated. This implosion of the pastiche stands in contrast to the ex- plosion of the collage. The Russian avantgardě director Sergei Eisenstein interprets the structure of Piranesi's Carceri as a col- lage: ". . . the series of spatial movements into the depths cut off from each other by columns and arches is constructed like a succession of independent spaces strung out not in terms of a single, uninterrupted perspective, but as a sequence of collisions of spaces whose depth is of a qualitatively different intensity"35</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 5.

He then goes on to compare the spatial effects of the prisons with his own use of cinematic montage in Potemkin, and says: "the montage is the stage of the explosion of the movie frame."36 As in a collage, Piranesi's prisons suggest an infinite yet discontinuous space achieved through the violent juxtaposition of different fragments. This juxtaposition implies a series of parallel layers, which are held in tension, in suspense. Eisenstein calls this spatial explosion an "ecstatic transfiguration" of the formal tensions within the work. These "ecstatic transfigura- tions" of Piranesi's Carceri have a close kinship to the strategies of transgression of the collage and montage which we have been discussing up to now in the work of the architectural avantgardě. The double presence in Piranesi's work of the pastiche and the collage, of implosion and explosion, is symptomatic of the two modes through which the breakdown of the dominant classical tradition and its conventions was to take place in modern times. His work, like that of de Sade, represents the dark side of the Enlightenment. Fig. 6. Giovanni Battista Piranesi, design for a prison {Carceri series)</page><page sequence="20">Fall-Winter 1987-88 109 Piranesi's "ecstatic transfiguration" and its analogy to the collage and montage allow us to comprehend the Utopian dimen- sion of the avantgarde's project: the shock of the new is not pursued for its own sake. The "ecstatic explosion" seeks to induce a state of recognition, of self-awareness; in short, it seeks to bring about an epiphany, a revelation that is to inaugurate a process of emancipation. This desire for an epiphany gives the avantgardě project its visionary character, its Utopian charge, a challenge which in extremis is hard to live with. If the avantgardě pursued a utopia of the future, kitsch exploits a utopia of the past. It is tempting to assert the superior- ity of the avantgardě as advanced and progressive in contrast to kitsch which is backwards and reactionary; but to argue thus is to reiterate the whole belief in Progress and Zeitgeist . The difference is within the work: the pastiche "acts out" a nostalgia for a lost authenticity searching for a false consolation, the avantgardě collage "works through" the loss of the aura under modern conditions of mechanization.37 As we have seen, the architectural avantgarde's claims of purity are paradoxically tied to acts of transgression, to inversion and perversion of previously established norms, and these trans- gressions are legitimized as an opposition to kitsch, since kitsch already had undertaken a previous transgression of traditional norms by evacuating its forms from any cultural significance. Kitsch also implicitly makes claims of purity, both by repro- ducing the formal features of pre-modern traditions and by intimating that it is innocent, accessible, immediate, and popular (interestingly enough, the kinds of arguments made by Venturi and Scott-Brown in Learning from Las Vegas). These claims are highly questionable. While seemingly faithful to tradition by re- producing its forms, "kitsch" works succeed in devaluing tradi- tion by robbing these forms of their depth and significance; architecture became taxidermy. If metaphors are categorial transgressions,38 the transgressions of kitsch can be understood as bad metaphors; they constitute a hackneyed poetics. Thus, despite the allusions to the past and to romantic poetry, they fail on aesthetic ground even when the building is commodious, well built, even urbane. Both avantgardě and kitsch participate in a complex dynam- ic of implicit claims of purity and acts of transgression. Both purity and transgression are equivocal strategies since they func- tion in relation to both the avantgardě and kitsch works; and therefore they must be judged critically, in terms of the conse-</page><page sequence="21">110 Discourse X. 1 quences within the work and in the world. To acknowledge the reciprocity of the avantgardě and the kitsch in terms of claims of purity and acts of transgression does not mean to collapse their difference. The difference is crucial: it entails questions of qual- ity not only in terms of cultural intentions, but also as aesthetic effects within the structure of the work.

Michael Shaw [Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1984]), I make a distinction between Modernism, which asserts the autonomy of art, and the avant- garde, which sought to reestablish a new relation of art and life. This allows us to more clearly differentiate between the avantgardě and its precursors. Thus under Modernism we would include French and Bel- gian Art Nouveau, Vienna Secession, German Jugendstil, Italian Stilo Liber- ty, Catalan Modernismo ; and under avantgardě we would include Italian Futurism, Dutch De Styjl, Russian Constructivism and Suprematists, French Purism, German Novembergruppe , Arbeitsrat für Kunst, the Bauhaus, etc. Many of the participants in avantgardě groups throughout Europe who had an explicit interest in architecture were later consolidated into a single institution CIAM: "Les Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne/Internationale Kongresse für Neues Bauen," established at La Sarraz, Switzerland, in 1928. 3 "La Recherche du Style Nouveau," Revue des Arts Décoratifs 1895. The desire for a new architecture corresponding to modern times is one of the recurrent obsessions of architectural critical discourse in the nineteenth century; this concern was represented in a number of tab- leaux, such as J. A. Coussins's "The Types of Architectural Progress," and César Daly's "L'Architecture Contemporaine," Revue générale de Г Architecture et des travaux publics (Paris, 1849), and articulated in the writings of Daly, Viollet Le Duc, Fergusson, Morris, and others.

Also William Cur- tis, "The Idea of a Modern Architecture," Modern Architecture since 1900 (Oxford: Phaidon, 1982). 4 This discourse was established through a series of critical texts. The earliest of these texts, Walter Gropius's Internationale Architektur (1925) was soon followed by L. Hilberseimer's Internationale neue Bau- kunst (Stuttgart, 1926), G. A.

Together these texts codified the works of the avantgardě into a canon, which is highly ironic, since one of the goals of avantgardě practices was to destroy the very possibility of an aesthetic canon and participants in the aesthetic avantgardě continued to object to the categorization of their works in terms of styles or shared formal features. 5 This interpretation was not simply imposed by commentators from without, it was promoted by the architects themselves, most nota- bly by Mies and especially Le Corbusier, who - with the painter Ozen- fant - founded a group called "Purism" and who consistently promoted his ideas under this banner. 6 Robert Venturi, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1966). 7 Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown, Learning from Las Vegas (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1977). 8 This is the argument presented by Abraham Moles, which is appropriate as far as it goes but does not problematize the simple dichot- omy between the avantgardě and kitsch.

It can be accomplished only in full consciousness of what it wants to super- cede - not only abstract principles of form which have been unable to sustain meaning in architecture but also the world of kitsch which has only sustained meanings in an impoverished form."

On this basis each concluded, somewhat pessimistically, that the only resolution would be brought by "Socialism." The dialogical, in contrast to the dialectical, does not seek to obliterate the difference between the two in a higher sublation or Aufhebung , but retains the difference necessary to maintain the movement between opposites, the play of contestation.

Unlike Tsumi, I do not borrow "trans- gression" literally from Bataille's and Foucault's discussions on the erot- ic, instead I exploit the spatial metaphor which makes the "concept" of transgression possible. Furthermore, as understood here, transgression is an equivocal strategy and needs to be judged critically, in terms of its consequences for human action; transgression is not valorized as in Foucault, Bataille, and, we might add, Tsumi. 17 Michel Foucault, Power I Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977 , trans.

As used here, "spatial practices" are akin to ritual, and "space of repre- sentation" is akin to iconography, both understood in spatial terms. Unlike ritual and icon which suggest an idealist framework, where hu- man actions are alienated from the specificity of the physical context within which they take place, the terms "spatial practices" and "space of representation" stress the nexus of space and human action; both terms emphasize the status of space as a mediated social construct, without returning to a simplistic functionalism or behaviorism. These concepts are useful to avoid a deterministic interpretation of the relation of space to human action and at the same time to avoid the claims that architec- ture is completely "autonomous." 21 This example is from the World's Exhibition held in London in 1851, under the auspices of Prince Albert. This was the first World's Exhibition and it witnessed the invasion of the public realm with private kitsch, which provided a major contrast to the beauty and simplicity of the exhibition hall, the Crystal Palace. The proliferation of kitsch at this historical juncture needs to be reexamined in the context of the failure of the revolutions of 1848. 22 Nietzsche, The Use and Abuse of History. 23 Deborah L.

If domestic architecture is feminine and public monuments are masculine, one wonders about other institutions, like commercial arcades: are they neuter or hermaphroditic? 27 On the move of the cemeteries to the outskirts in the eighteenth century, see Richard Etlin, "Landscapes of Eternity," Oppositions 8 (1977): 14-31. 28 The quartier is not an eternal urban feature, as Leon Krier seems to believe; it is a historical construct. In the case of Haussman, the quartier, separated by the major boulevards, becomes one of the main ways to spatially segregate the city to facilitate its rebuilding with private capital and to avoid the possibility of future barricades. The Haussman legacy is ambiguous; it bequeathed a city of great elegance and sophisti- cation, but it also provided the most successful precedent for the de- struction of historic urban centers on short-term political and economic grounds. Of course, in comparison with the insane policies of Le Corbu- sier, Haussman's rebuilding of Paris seems the epitome of enlightened intervention. 29 Le Corbusier in particular was responsible for one of the worst ideas to date: the "City in the Park" which turned into the "City in the Parking Lot." Its purpose was to replace the suburban dream of individ- ual free standing homes with free standing skyscrapers as urban ma- chines. The goal was to reconcile the machine and the garden, and ostensibly to democratize and provide these natural amenities to every- one. Nevertheless, as Le Corbusier made clear, his city of towers is for the captains of industry; the workers are in the margins, "out of sight, out of mind." 30 Kenneth Frampton and Yukio Futagawa, Modern Architecture (New York: Rizzoli Publications, Inc., 1983) 333. 31 Furthermore the use of Japanese modes was not confined to the work of the avantgardě or kitsch; it was successfully exploited for aes- thetic ends by the California architects Green and Green and by Frank Lloyd Wright, most notably in his design for the Imperial Hotel in Japan. 32 Colin Rowe has wittily characterized Le Corbusier's obsession with the engineer as "the engineer as noble savage." See Collage City for a discussion of the architect as an engineer and a bricoleur, based on Lévi- Strauss's The Savage Mind. Here, in contrast to Le Corbusier's earnest pronouncements, this play is seen to operate ironically within the work. 33 Vincent Scully, Modern Architecture (New York: George Braziller, 1974) 12.</page><page sequence="26">Fall-Winter 1987-88 115 34 Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Polemical Works (Farnborough, Hamp- shire: Gregg International, 1972). 35 Sergei Eisenstein, "Piranesi, Or the Fluidity of Forms," trans.
