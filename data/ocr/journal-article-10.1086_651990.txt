The emblem, invented by the Italian lawyer Andrea Alciato in 1531, can be seen as the ultimate attempt to blur the boundaries between the visual and the literary: word and image were to be combined in the emblem, a genre dedicated to achieving a This research was carried out as part of  a project, “The Religious Emblem Tradition in the Low Countries in the Light of  Herman Hugo’s Pia Desideria,” coordinated by Marc Van Vaeck and Els Stronks; see http://emblems.let.uu.nl/project_project_info.html#PiaDesideria.

In the history of  Western Europe, discussions about the competitive relation between word and image have perhaps never been more intense than during the sixteenth century, when the issue came to be intertwined with religious controversies among Reformers and Roman Catholics.4 Reformers tried to establish the dominance of  word over image in devotional practices, arguing that the word reveals, whereas the image conceals and coerces. Roman Catholics, on the other hand, de- fended the superiority of  devotional imagery with the argument that the visual arts stimulate the imaginative and commemorative power of  the human mind in ways texts cannot.5 These tensions over the issue even- tually materialized as a historical phenomenon around 1566 in the icon- oclastic breaking of  images almost everywhere in Europe. With de Montenay’s Cent emblemes chrestiens, religion and confes- sional strategies became a constitutive part of  the emblematic tradition.6 Roman Catholic artists and poets soon followed de Montenay’s example, deciding to “fight fire with fire”7 and create their own collection of  re- ligious emblem books.8 The religious emblem was favored by the Jesuit 2 Lesley Stevenson, “Sister Arts or Sibling Rivalry?

In Wierix’s engravings, Christ is preparing and protecting the believer’s heart, a place where the love and grace of  God can be received. The heart becomes a site for personal contemplation and self-improvement and the dwelling place for Christ.12 9 “In the hands of  the Jesuits the emblem was both an artistic-ingenious and a persuasive means of  communication. It made the spiritual insistently tangible, visible and admirable for the complete human being, viz. for the eyes and the other senses, the intellectual capacities, the heart, the emotions and the affects” (Karel Porteman, “The Use of  the Visual in Classical Jesuit Teaching and Education,” Paedagogica Historica. International Journal of the His- tory of Education 36 [2000]: 178–96, quote on 181). In a sense, the innovative stimulus of Hugo’s Pia Desideria was a limited one: Otto Vaenius had already introduced amor divinus in the religious love emblem in his Amoris Divini Emblemata (1615), the religious adaptation of  his Amorum Emblemata (1608). On that occasion, the figure of  the secular god of  love, Cupid, was replaced by Vaenius, without authorial comment with a cherub with a halo to represent divine love: a type of  representation that was indebted to the context of  a spiritual environment already familiar with guardian angels and the Christ child.

When the religious love emblem began to flourish in the Southern Netherlands, the custom of  imparting religious instruction by means of images was as yet unestablished in the predominantly Protestant Dutch Republic. While elsewhere in Europe, for instance in England,13 Protes- tants produced religious literature in which the image and the word were combined, Protestant poets in the Dutch Republic were not accustomed in 13 See Tessa Watt, Cheap Print and Popular Piety, 1550–1640 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991). </page> <page sequence="5">             History of Religions 223 Fig. 2.—“Templum Christj cor hominis,” pictura in Zacharias Heyns, Em- blemes chrestiennes et morales (Rotterdam: Pieter van Waesberge, 1625), fol. C2r. the beginning of  the seventeenth century to the use of  devotional imagery in their religious work. This being the case, it is remarkable that a clear echo of  Wierix’s engraving is found in the Protestant emblem book Emblemes chrestiennes et morales, by Zacharias Heyns, published in the Dutch Republic in 1625 (see fig. 2). Within a burning heart, we see a rep- resentation of  Christ holding a standard and being surrounded by a temple. </page> <page sequence="6">                            224 Dutch Religious Emblems The reader is told, in the motto (“Templum Christj cor hominis”) and the subscriptio (epigram) of  this emblem, that the human heart should be Christ’s temple. Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes et morales was, in the Dutch Republic, the first Protestant attempt to appropriate the Roman Catholic religious emblematic tradition. In this article, I will argue that studying Zacharias Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes et morales leads to new insights with re- spect to the shaping of  religious identities and the interrelation between different denominations in the Dutch Republic at the time. Heyns’s re- ligious emblem book, in which Roman Catholic imagery plays an im- portant role, allows us to establish the role of  devotional actions in constructing religious identity. One of  the questions asked in this paper is whether his emblems can be seen as an indication that Dutch Protestant poets around 1625 were reconsidering the self-imposed restrictions on the use of  devotional images. Although the focus of  this article is on one Dutch emblem book and its Dutch context, this particular case contributes to a wider debate recently initiated by the emblem scholar Daniel Russell in his article “Emblems and Iconoclasm.”14 Russell, following the line of  thought presented in Alain Besançon’s The Forbidden Image,15 attempts to situate the emblem in the history of  imagery and iconoclasm in Western Europe.16 Russell argues that iconoclasm caused images to be detached from their iconic status, because images were no longer seen as the carrier of  one particular message—as “icon” or “idol.” The emblematic genre, he argues, has its origins in this progressive desacralization of  the image, a process that turned even religious images into empty rhetorical vessels. In support of this theory, Russell points to the English reception of  the Pia Desideria. The English poet Francis Quarles successfully reworked Hugo’s emblems for an Anglican audience in 1635 without changing the picturae (images) and with very few changes to the texts accompanying the picturae.17 Russell therefore concludes that by that time “the iconoclastic tendencies of  early English Protestantism had largely abated,”18 since the use of 14 Daniel Russell, “Emblems and Iconoclasm,” in Emblemata Sacra: The Rhetoric and Hermeutics of Illustrated Sacred Discourse, ed. Ralph Dekoninck and Agnès Guiderdoni- Bruslé (Turnhout: Brepols, 2007), 39–52. 15 Alain Besançon, The Forbidden Image: An Intellectual History of Iconoclasm (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 2000). 16 The Catholic Church had a rich history of  iconoclastic disputes even before the Refor- mation. See, e.g., Charles Barber, Figure and Likeness: On the Limits of Representation in Byzantine Iconoclasm (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002). 17 Quarles’s Emblems came to be “the best-known emblem book in English history” (Aakanksha Virkar-Yates, “The Heart’s Bower: Emblematics in Gerard Manley Hopkins’s The Wreck of the Deutschland (1876),” Literature and Theology 22 [2008]: 32–47, quote on 32). 18 Russell, “Emblems and Iconoclasm,” 49. </page> <page sequence="7"> History of Religions 225 Roman Catholic imagery in Protestant religious literature was more than acceptable to the Anglican audience. According to Russell, then, religious emblems successfully reconciled imagery with the Protestant faith. Heyns’s emblems offer an ideal oppor- tunity to test out this thesis for the Dutch Republic. Iconoclasm also in- fluenced sixteenth-century societies in an ideological way by setting limits to the poetic and visual expression of  artists and poets.19 This aspect of iconoclasm played a part in the process of  shaping and changing religious identities at the time.20 The contrasting ideologies served as a means to stigmatize “the other” and, by doing so, to identify “the self.”21 Heyns was the first to bring devotional images and Roman Catholic devotion into Dutch Protestant culture and worship in the seventeenth century, and he introduced them via the medium of  religious emblematic literature. In this article, it is established whether his emblem book points to a growing confessional consensus in the Dutch Republic. Emblem books are, for more reasons than one, useful aids in the recon- struction of  early modern thought, serving to capture the process of  shaping and changing (religious) identities at the time. In general, early modern literature is considered one of  the most fundamental factors in shaping the connection between individuals and cultural practices and in demarcating confessional and cultural differences. Emblems were especially made to provide answers to questions concerning moral conduct and, in the case of  religious emblems, also concerning religious conduct and ideologies. In the following pages, I will first examine the Dutch historical context of  Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes et morales, which will pave the way for a discussion of  a number of  his emblems that are thematically con- cerned with the word-image issue. I will conclude by relating Heyns’s work to the question of  interconfessional cultural exchange. 19 Such a case is discussed by Kirsten Stirling, in “Imagined Corners: Space, Time and Iconoclasm in John Donne’s Last Judgement Holy Sonnets,” Word and Image 21 (2005): 244–51. 20 Identity is understood here as the way individuals and groups define themselves and are defined by others. It involves the representations (images) that are conveyed through media. Such representations involve construing differences and similarities between “us” and “them” according to multiple criteria: religion, gender, politics, artistic preferences, ethnic origins, and so on. For a description of  the terminology used here, see Nancy T. Ammerman, “Religious Identities and Religious Institutions,” in Handbook of the Sociology of Religion, ed. Michele Dillon (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 207–24; and, for variety of  discus- sions on this subject, see Willem van Asselt, Paul van Geest, Daniela Muller, and Theo Salemink, eds., Iconoclasm and Iconoclash: Struggle for Religious Identity (Leiden: Brill, 2007). 21 Ralph Dekoninck, “Querelle de l’image et image de la querelle,” in Controverses et po- lémiques religieuses: Antiquité–temps modernes, ed.

The use of  images was viewed as a conces- sion to (weak) human nature: humankind is by nature promptly stimulated and amused by visual representations, which are also easily remembered. Nevertheless, images were thought to be deceitful.24 The Dutch disputes were dominated by Calvinist theology. Although Calvin was more severe in his condemnation of  images than were other Reformers, he was not opposed to all visual art. He held that images should not be used in worship or in church and that all anthropomorphic repre- sentations of  God or Jesus should be prohibited but that in the privacy of one’s home one could enjoy portraits, historical paintings, and still-life compositions.25 As Randall C. Zachman recently concluded in his Image and Word in the Theology of John Calvin, Calvin distinguished between “living” and “dead” images of  God. Living images of  God can be found in the Word of  God itself, and in the universe; dead images are images created by human hands. Zachman also concluded that an unresolvable tension lies at the heart of  Calvin’s discussion of  the living images of  God: On the one hand, Calvin contrasts the “dead images” that humans create, which are only the image of  absent things, with the “living images” instituted by God, which truly represent the reality they represent. On the other hand, Calvin re- jects the use of  images in worship on the basis of  the invisible nature of  God, which cannot be represented in any symbol or image. He can at times so insist on the essential invisibility of  God that he appears to undermine his whole under- 22 See John Dillenberger, Images and Relics, 167. In the sixteenth century, public opinion had been influenced both by Protestant and by Roman Catholic publications such as Veluanus’s Der leken wechwyser (1554), Van der Heyden’s Corte instrucye (1545), Hessels’s Tractatus pro invocatione sanctorum (1562), and Molanus’s De Picturis et imaginibus sacris (1570).

In other words, Calvin opposed only “the religious use of  the visual arts” (Daniel W. Hardy, “Calvinism and the Visual Arts: A Theological Introduction,” in Seeing beyond the Word: Visual Arts and the Calvinist Tradition, ed. Paul Corby Finney [Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1999], 1–16, quote on 16).

Again, he creates this tension in order to maintain the dialectical relationship between the visibility and invisibility of  God, and the presence and absence of  God, which he thinks is maintained by images of  divine creation but not by images of  human devising.26 These nuances in Calvin’s opinions were lost during the second half  of the sixteenth century, when Calvin’s followers proved to be more fanatic than Calvin himself  had ever been.27 Iconoclastic violence reached a climax in 1566, when the breaking of  images grew to be a nationwide phenomenon in the Netherlands. Around 1600, (public) discussions on the use of  religious imagery in the Dutch Republic seem to have come to a rest, possibly because Protestantism had triumphed and extremist proc- lamations in its defense were no longer considered necessary.28 One of  the last attempts to stir up Protestant resistance was made by the minister Vincent Meusevoet in 1604, when he published Waarschouwing teeghen de Afgooderye in de laatste Tyden, a translation of  a pamphlet by the English Puritan William Perkins, A Warning against the Idolatrie of the Last Times (1601).29 Meusevoet’s Dutch translation was never reprinted. Instead, some Protestant authors started to apologize openly for their fellow believers’ behavior during the breaking of  images in 1566.30 During the seventeenth century, the process of  revising and exchanging opinions on the matter continued. In general, although the Calvinists were very in- fluential in the Dutch Republic, it is not possible to identify one specific denomination as the underlying force of  Dutch culture in the seventeenth century.31 There was no real state church, and the principle of  freedom of conscience, which had served as the legitimizing principle of  the Dutch Revolt, assured some freedom of  speech for Anabaptists, Remonstrants, 26 See Randall C.

The question is whether such an overt display in Protestant culture of  Roman Catholic influences deriving from the tradition of  the religious love emblem in the Southern Netherlands was acceptable in 1625. During the first decades of  the seventeenth century, imagery slowly made its way back into Protestant churches—not only in the form of  text paintings (tekstborden, or “painted lines of  texts”) but also in the form of stained-glass windows, chandeliers, decorative borders, and tombs.35 In an attempt to gain a nuanced view of  the impact of  iconoclasm on Dutch so- ciety at the time, Mia Mochizuki describes how these tekstborden became an established fixture in Dutch Reformed churches in the early seventeenth century. The text paintings exhibit, as Mochizuki argues, “the broad re- consideration of  word, image and society that reformation heralded both inside and outside the picture plane.” She concludes that the Dutch text paintings provide “at least one positive material legacy of  the pictorial potential suggested by iconoclasm.”36 These images did not have the same 32 Douwe W.

One Line Short </page> <page sequence="11"> History of Religions 229 objectives that devotional images had in the Roman Catholic churches, Mochizuki argues. For the Protestants, according to Mochizuki, these images “invoked reflection on the tenets of  belief  and stimulated the viewer’s intellect, rather than empathic sensory responses alone.”37 The power of  imagery was used “to articulate faith and reiterate biblical tutelage . . . rather than to recreate passionate devotion and stimulate idolatry.”38 Protestants did not stop at reintroducing religious imagery in their churches but brought it to their houses as well. Scenes from the Bible— depicted according to a strict interpretation of  biblical sources—served as subjects for paintings and prints.39 Coinciding with Calvin’s thoughts on the admissibility of  portraits, historical paintings, and still-life com- positions, a preference for realism developed in the visual arts.40 Land- scapes also became popular, as nature was seen as God’s second book.41 While religious imagery was gradually making a comeback in Protestant churches and homes, in religious literature the primacy of  the word re- mained. Protestant religious literature in the Dutch Republic—written by Calvinists, Remonstrants, and Anabaptists alike42—during the first half of  the seventeenth century consisted for a very large part of  unillustrated prayer books and collections of  hymns.43 Even the title pages of  these books mostly do not have any illustrations; the only visual effect publishers pursued were created by variations in the typography.44 In the more so- phisticated publications made for the elite, illustrations were also missing; the fact that the cheap hymn books and prayer books were not illustrated thus seems to be caused by ideological rather than economic considera- tions. The visual effects in the more expensive editions were also limited to typographical means. For instance, Willem Blaeu, the publisher of  Con- stantijn Huygens’s Heilighe Dagen [Holy days],45 decided to print every 37 Mochizuki, “Supplanting the Devotional Image,” 147. 38 Ibid., 148 and 151. 39 Existent Roman Catholic representations of  these biblical scenes were very often used and transformed. For instance, this process has been detected in the work practice of  the Cal- vinist painter Adriaen Thomaszoon Key. See Koenraad J. A. Jonckheere, Adriaen Thomasz.

The differences are evident when one compares Hugo’s religious emblem book Pia Desideria, published in Antwerp in 1624, to Dirck Rafaelszoon Camphuysen’s Stichtelijke rijmen (Educational poems), also published in 1624, which was one of  the most popular collec- tions of  hymns in the Dutch Republic and ran to more than fifty editions. Illustrations formed a crucial part of  the Pia Desideria, since Hugo’s engraver, Boëtius a Bolswert, transformed the pictura from a carrier of meaning into an expression of  emotion, thus supporting Hugo in his medi- tative purposes.47 The newness of  the Pia Desideria consisted in its em- phasis on the emotional dimension of  love: human feelings and reactions to God occupy a central place in Hugo’s emblems, not resulting—as was true in Wierix’s case—in the visualization of  the heart representing the human interiority in which the divine becomes inscribed but instead in a central focus on the theme of  “looking.” Different aspects of  this theme are discussed in the programmatic opening emblem of  the Pia Desideria. The relationship between the reader and God is visualized in the pictura by the arrows, which rise from the human heart to God’s ears and single eye (see fig. 3). The accompanying subscriptio explains how an actor hides in every human being, thus revealing the meaning of  the mask positioned on the left in the pictura: “O, how often the mind, as an actor, disperses false signals / while the eyes and facial expression contradict one’s state of  mind.”48 Only God can look through the false appearances of  every human being, but in the rest of  the subscriptio Hugo promises his readers that they can learn how to have a look at the true nature of  at least their own soul by using his emblems. The eye is also the central focus of  the pictura in figure 4. The image shows the soul, wandering around at night and being guided by amor di- vinus holding a lamp. The soul is frightened by the darkness but realizes that she, being “in alien territory,” should rely upon her eyes: 46 See Constantijn Huygens, Avondmaalsgedichten en Heilige Dagen: Uitgegeven en toegelicht door Frederik L.

Our eyes enjoy a better fate; for them in a fixed order, Moon and sun have their alternating turns! For what should reason, what should focused study do, The twosome49 that the soul in alien territory has as its guides? A larger pain it is to have eyes when it is not given to use them, Than not to have had eyes at all to use.50 This realization eventually leads the soul to God, because she now knows where to turn her eyes for salvation, as she utters over and over again in the rest of  the emblems—for instance, in emblem 3: Therefore, to which altars, Could I turn my eye—altars that Libitina51 does not mark with funerals—but to those of  Your divine power?52 The eye will direct the other senses, the heart and the mind to God, and God’s eyes are vital to the soul’s existence: I can do without beautiful hair and eyes, And no beauty holds me fettered in chains. However, I cannot live separated from your eyes, my life, my heart— It is the same as living without a heart.53 The emphases on the eye and on sight underline Hugo’s message that the pictorial images presented in the picturae were to replace mental images or provide an aid to the imagination as it formed mental images, thus serving as stimuli of  the meditative process.54 49 The “twosome” is the eyes. 50 “Heu, quoties subit illius mihi noctis imago, / Nox animo toties ingruit atra meo! / Sors oculis nostris melior, quibus ordine certo, / Alternas reparant lunáque sólque vices! / Nam quid agat ratio, quid agat studiosa voluntas, / Quas habet, vt geminos mens peregrina duces? / Maior, habere oculos, dolor est, vbi non datur vti, / Quàm, quibus vtaris, non habuisse oculos” (Hugo, subscriptio to pictura, “Anima mea desiderauit te in nocte,” in Pia Desideria, fol. 1, verse 2, lines 3–10 (trans.

See Porteman, “The Use of  the Visual,” esp. 181. </page> <page sequence="16"> 234 Dutch Religious Emblems In contrast, the Remonstrant minister Camphuysen was opposed to all forms of  the visual arts “enchantress of  the eye that misinterprets the mortal.”55 Even though once a painter himself, his Stichtelijke rijmen is not illustrated. Indeed, the work includes not only hymns dealing with the total sanctification of  the Christian life56 but also a rhymed transla- tion of  Johannes Geesteranus’s Idolelenchus, a pamphlet originally written in Latin, in which the use of  all imagery was discussed and prohibited. Visual perception is deceitful: “What the eyes see and dwell upon, the sweet senses instantly like. / The idle image controls the weak inner.”57 The eye cannot be trusted; the readers should instead rely on the capacities of  their mind, stimulating it by reading God’s Word aloud—“sword to the human mind.”58 The subtitle of  Camphuysen’s Stichtelijke rijmen— “Om te lesen of  te singen” (For the purpose of  reading or singing)—in- dicates that music can be also be used as an aural stimulus. The lyrics form a guide to domestic life, supporting the believers’ private worship by integrating paraphrases of  the biblical acts of  God into day-to-day activities such as praying, eating, and working.59 Eighteenth-century edi- tions of  these collections of  hymns and prayer books were often lavishly illustrated, but in the original seventeenth-century editions images were excluded.60 The custom in Protestant poetry of  avoiding images as a means of religious instruction did not only result in the massive production of  un- illustrated hymnals and prayer books among Protestants in the Dutch Republic; it also had ramifications for the development of  the emblematic genre.61 These can be detected through the case of  the Calvinist Jacob Cats, 55 “Verleydt-Ster van ’t gezicht dat sich verstaart op ’t sterffelijck” (Dirck R. Camphuyzen, “Tegen ’t Geestigdom der Schilderkunst,” in Stichtelycke rymen: Om te lesen of te singen [Amsterdam, 1647], 224). In the 1647 edition, published long after Camphuysen’s death in 1627, the publisher Jacob Colom decided to illustrate the Stichtelijke rijmen with some copper- plates. On Camphuysen’s vision of  the visual arts, see Eric J. Sluijter, “Belering en verhulling?

Cats’s first emblem books are of  a moralistic nature, as they are directed toward gen- eral human virtues.62 Karel Porteman concludes that within these first vol- umes “the emblem still remains . . . first and foremost a didactic method, a bimedial genus scribendi [manner of  writing] with moral intentions.”63 Rather than representing religious acts or scenes in these emblem books, Cats made direct use of  realia (real events and objects, often reflecting aspects of  the weak and silly nature of  human behavior) in his picturae. His decision to devote his poetic talents to the emblematic genre and ex- pose his reader to imagery apparently required some explanation, since it is offered in the preface to Sinne- en Minnebeelden (1618 and 1627). Cats warns the reader to take nothing at face value, since underneath the image (“het uytterlijcke beelt”) a deeper meaning can be found (“inner- lijcken sin”). Cats’s emblems invite the reader to investigate what at first sight does not seem to be there. The image itself  should not be blamed if its deeper meaning confronts the reader with improper human behavior: “For it is not the image itself, but its deeper meaning, that is question- able.”64 Cats’s later works bear the stamps of  pietistic Puritanism, focusing on the inner experiences of  Reformed doctrine and the sanctification of one’s personal life.65 These emblem books can be characterized as truly religious, aiming to tame the greedy eye by the inner heart, as explained by Cats in the dedication of  Invallende Gedachten: If  our inner heart would make the best of  everything Seen by our eyes, we would learn very much! But if  the better part of  us does not get any good out of  it, Our eye is the cause of  much evil.66 Cornelis Boel, and Adriaan van der Venne, among others—to the fame of  Dutch emblem books and prints. Thanks to them, the pictorial element of  Dutch emblematics became a model for foreign poets and engravers despite the reservations regarding the use of  imagery. 62 They are moralistic for the most part, even though some love emblems are given a re- ligious explanation in Cats’s Sinne- en Minnebeelden [Images of  meaning and love] (Rotter- dam: Pieter van Waesberge, 1618 and 1627). 63 See Karel Porteman, “Cats’s Concept of  the Emblem and the Role of  Occasional Med- itation,” Emblematica 6 (1992): 65–82, quote on 67. Cats’s other emblem books made in this period are Maechden-plicht [The maiden’s duties] (1618) and Spiegel van den Ouden en Nieuwen Tyt [Mirror of  old and new times] (1632). 64 “mitsdien, niet so seer het beeldt, als den sin, uyt het beelt ontstaende, bedenckelijck is” (Cats, Sinne- en minnebeelden, 1627 ed.).

Only a few of  the emblems, all concerned with human pursuits, are illustrated. Cats chose to be very reserved with regard to imagery in the perception of  faith, regardless of  the fact that the prescriptions of  the em- blematic genre called for word and image to be combined in a productive manner. This does not mean that Cats had no eye for the power of  the image; rather, Cats considered the image inferior to the word in religious matters. The lessons to be drawn from the occurrences Cats describes are addressed to the heart of  the reader; the eye does not play any role in these occasional meditations. The pivot of  the Protestants’ pietistic movement with which Cats was affiliated, Nadere Reformatie (Further Reformation), was the Utrecht Uni- versity professor Gisbertus Voetius, whose thoughts on piety were shaped by polemics with Roman Catholic authors. At the time, the Dutch word devotie had a Roman Catholic connotation, but it was nevertheless used by Voetius and understood as the “despondency of  the heart.”68 The central notions of  Voetius’s thoughts are explained in his Exercitia Pietatis (1664), an academic handbook on the practice of  piety written to instruct future ministers and based on lectures given in the 1630s. In Exercitia Pietatis, Voetius maintains that the effect of  conversion as a work of  God can take shape in a conscientious life. In the sanctification of  the believer’s soul, the visual plays no part.69 To Voetius, seeing God in the flesh during medi- tative exercises—a vision that many Roman Catholics claimed to have experienced—was impossible: “seeing God” to Voetius meant rationaliz- ing God, using the intellect rather than the eye.70 In this line of  thought, Voetius even advised believers to close their eyes while praying: “the liberty of  the external senses, especially of  the eye”71 would disturb the cultus internus, the inner awareness of  God’s love toward us, which in- 67 Porteman, “Cats’s Concept of  the Emblem,” 78–79. 68 Gisbertus Voetius, De praktijk der godzaligheid (Ta asketika sive “Exercitia pietatis,” 1664), ed. and trans. Cornelis A. de Niet [edition of  the Latin text, with an introduction, translation into Dutch, commentary, and summary in English], 2 vols. (Utrecht: De Banier, 1996), 1:lxxxvi–lxxxvii. 69 In his inaugural address at Utrecht, in 1634, Voetius already recommended Puritan avoid- ance in the use of  literature for pietistic purposes, a kind of  thinking that hindered the prac- tice of  religious poetry in Protestant circles, since Voetius was one of  the prominent leaders of  the Reformed Church. See Schenkeveld, Literature in the Age of Rembrandt, 48–49. 70 “Licentia externorum sensuum, praecipue oculorum” (Voetius, De praktijk der godza- ligheid, 2: cap. 3, p. 73). 71 Ibid., 2: cap. 4, p. 148. </page> <page sequence="19"> History of Religions 237 spires one to thankfulness and leads to obeying God’s law in one’s inner life.72 “Bound meditation, also called meditation based on a text” was rec- ommended by Voetius,73 while religious imagery is never mentioned in a positive sense. For instance, Voetius disapproved of  using images of  the sufferings of  Christ in meditative exercises, “as if  God’s Word does not have sufficient power to touch the stony heart.”74 Instead, he acknowledged the importance of  vocal expression and aural experiences: singing enforces the effects of  praying.75 Voetius’s Exercitia Pietatis appears to reflect the widespread opinion in the Dutch Republic that in Protestant worship the function of  sight was subordinated to the function of  sound. Dutch Protestant poets lived and worked in a tradition that dictated reserve with regard to imagery in the practice of  faith. Consequently, the strategy of  enhancing one’s religion by means of  the religious imagery was not adopted by Cats or by any other Protestant emblematist in the Dutch Republic in the beginning of the seventeenth century.76 heyns’s effort to subvert In these inhospitable surroundings, Heyns published his Emblemes chres- tiennes et morales in 1625. In doing so, Heyns—who was a Protestant but never a member of  the Calvinist, Anabaptist, or Remonstrant church77— worked together with the engraver Jan Gerritszoon Swelinck, who had made one copperplate for Johan De Brune’s Emblemata (1624) and the title print of  the 1627 edition of  Cats’s Sinne- en minnebeelden.78 Heyns’s emblem book was published by Pieter van Waesberge, who also published 72 Ibid., 1:lxxxvii. 73 “Astricta seu textualis meditatio” (ibid., 2: cap. 3, p. 60). 74 “quasi non sufficeret malleus verbi divini ad petras cordium contundendas” (ibid., 2: cap. 4, p. 256). For an example of  the Roman Catholic use of  the imagery to which Voetius is referring here, see Walter S. Melion, “ ‘Haec per imagines huius mysterij Ecclesia sancta [clamat]’: The Image of  the Suffering Christ in Jerome Nadal’s Adnotationes et Medita- tiones in Evangelia,” introductory study in Jerome Nadal, Annotations and Meditations on the Gospels, vol. 2: The Passion Narratives, trans. and ed.

Born in Antwerp, as the son of  the Calvinist schoolmaster Peeter Heyns, who had migrated northward with his family in 1585, Heyns had many connections with publishers and writers taking refuge from the Spanish oppression during the Eighty Years’ War after the fall of  Antwerp.80 What was Heyns’s method of  working when he tried to introduce the religious emblem in the Dutch Republic? In the title of  his emblem book, and in many of  his subscriptios in which he mentions de Montenay’s name, Heyns paid tribute to de Montenay’s Cent emblemes chrestiens,81 but he borrowed many of  the ideas for his picturae from Roman Catholic religious imagery.82 The similarities can easily be detected by looking at the imagery Heyns applied in emblem 5 of  his Emblemes chrestiennes et morales, in the pictura of  the burning heart, as shown in figure 2 above. Heyns did not simply copy devotional images from the Roman Catholic tradition. He reworked his models to adapt them to a different functional purpose, as can be seen in this pictura (the image of  the risen Christ in the heart aflame), and in the subscriptio accompanying the pictura, in which the emphasis is laid on the central role of  the church building and of  singing in Protestant worship: Although God’s word, if  taught or read to us Alone, at home, can be of  comfort, What’s learned in public, attentively, Carries more weight and is after all more powerful. He wants us to join our voices, To sing his Praise, in competition with the angels.83 79 See Aad van Mameren, “Fondslijst van Pieter van Waesberghe,” in Rotterdam bibli- opolis: Een rondgang langs boekverkopers uit de zeventiende en achttiende eeuw, ed.

Anna’s handwritten versions of  de Montenay’s emblems at the time were known and read only in private circles.

While Wierix had portrayed amor divinus as a diminutive, childlike figure, Heyns deviates from that pictorial tradition by choosing to represent amor divinus as an adult man—indeed, as Jesus—diminishing the emo- tional overtone of  the pictura. A less intimate relationship between readers and Christ is thus constructed within “Templum Christj cor hominis”; entering or probing the mystery of  God through the use of  the eyes and of sight seems not to be pursued by Heyns. Some confessional, Protestant overtones are added that address the readers’ intellect rather than their senses. The image of  the heart no longer serves as a stimulus for a medi- tative process; it simply visualizes how God, faith, and the believer’s heart should be unified. In obtaining this unity, the image plays no role. Prac- ticing piety is best done while reading and singing with other people. The church building depicted in the pictura underlines this message, even more so while Christ is pointing to the church towering over his head, direct- ing the attention of  the readers to the surroundings of  the heart rather than to the heart itself. The church as an institution rather the individual’s emotions appears to be Heyns’s focus. There appear to have been limits to what Heyns could portray. Counter- acting the impression that he might be encouraging physical worship of the (human) figure of  God—obviously rather problematic in a Protestant context—Heyns cleverly avoids an anthropomorphic depiction of  God in emblem 3, “Trinitas unitatis Simplicitatem non excludit.” In the pictura (see fig. 5), the Holy Trinity—a controversial topic, even in the history of Roman Catholic iconography84—is represented by two numbers. Heyns preserves the powerful effect of  imagery on the human mind by represent- ing the distinct unity of  God, Holy Spirit, and Jesus—the numerals 1 and 3 are not simply placed next to each other but seem to descend from one another—but making sure not to mingle himself  in the controversies sur- rounding the topic. Working in a visual tradition predicated upon the illegitimacy of  pictorializing spiritual concepts, this typographical repre- sentation of  the Holy Trinity substitutes for the traditional religious meer gewichts, heeft al veel grooter kracht. / Hy wil dat wy aldaer ons stemmen lieflijck dwingen / En synen loff  als om strijt als met syn Eng’len singen” (Heyns, Emblemes chres- tiennes, fol. C3r). 84 Twice in the history of  the Roman Catholic Church a papal prohibition was issued against anthropomorphic depictions of  the Holy Trinity. Theological objections to depicting the Holy Trinity in this manner were rife in the early modern era. See Jan Hallebeek, “Papal Prohibitions Midway between Rigor and Laxity: On the Issue of  Depicting the Holy Trinity,” in Iconoclasm and Iconoclash, 353–83; see also Volker Manuth, “Denomination and Ico- nography: The Choice of  Subject Matter in the Biblical Painting of  the Rembrandt Circle,” Simiolus 22 (1993–94): 235–52, esp. 245–46. </page> <page sequence="22"> 240 Dutch Religious Emblems Fig. 5.—“Trinitas unitatis Simplicitatem non excludit,” pictura in Zacharias Heyns, Emblemes chrestiennes et morales (Rotterdam: Pieter van Waesberge, 1625), fol.

Again, the lesson in this emblem relates to the worship of  God: “It is more respectful and sacred to believe in God than to try to know everything about him—just as Augustine has proclaimed one will know him better while living in sober ignorance.”85 Solving the mystery of  the Holy Trinity should not be the reader’s aim. God is best served by believing in him, not by trying to grasp his nature and doings. The image is used as an aid to the believer’s capacities to visualize an element of  the Protestant doctrine, but it does not serve as a sign of  the invisible. 85 “Heyliger en eerbiediger te syn van God te ghelooven als te weten, dewijle hy (na de getuyghenisse Augustinj) beter word gekent in sobere onwetenheyt” (Heyns, Emblemes chrestiennes, fol.

Adapting Roman Catholic imagery to his own purposes and needs, Heyns purposely made a distinction between the newness of  his religious (Christian) emblems and the existing moralistic tradition, as is indicated by his book’s title, Emblemes chrestiennes et morales. Heyns’s book is divided into a part with religious (chrestiennes) emblems and another part with moralistic (morales) emblems. The picturae of  Heyns’s series of  moralistic emblems clearly differ from the imagery used in the religious emblems in his volume. In fact, the picturae of  Heyns’s moralistic em- blems show a remarkable similarity to Cats’s imagery (see figs. 6 and 7), and Heyns’s subscriptios in the moralistic part of  his volume contain far fewer biblical quotes and are not directed to the worship of  God.86 Scenes 86 There are seventy-three biblical quotations in the Emblemes chrestiennes and only nineteen in the Emblemes Morales.

In the case of  the pictura shown in figure 6 (“Principijs obstas”), “One should raise one’s offspring well” is demonstrated by the process of  the grafting of  a tree which, if  not done properly, will result in disaster. Just like Cats, Heyns used this image to explain how important it is for parents to raise their children well. In order to accentuate the difference between the “religious” emblem and the “moralistic” emblem, Heyns inserted an element of  the pictorial language from the series of  religious emblems into one of  the moralistic emblems, transforming it to profane imagery (see fig. 8).

Referring to Genesis 8:21 (“for the imagi- nation of  man’s heart is evil from his youth”), Heyns explains to the reader the sinful nature of  the human heart. Instead of  urging the reader to focus on the worship of  God—as he would have done in one of  the religious emblems—Heyns now gives advice on how to carefully avoid all worldly temptations.

A2r. Emblemes chrestiennes (see fig. 9) can be perceived as a vindication of Heyns’s efforts to present the novelty of  the religious emblems in the Dutch Republic. The word takes up a central position in the pictura— which shows God’s name in letters but not his figurative presence—as well as in the motto (“Verbum Domini perstat in æternum” [God’s Word lasts forever]) and in the subscriptios: </page> <page sequence="27"> History of Religions 245 Everything on earth which exists in time will perish, Stars will fall, not a thing will persist, God’s word, God’s sacred word, shall last forever, Has been there from the beginning, while it creates all the time. His will lives in the word, the word in his will, In the word, after his will, he created light for us: O, my God, my Lord, please create a pure heart in me, So that I can leave the earth and willingly turn to you.87 Everything on earth will perish, but God’s Word created the world and will continue to exist—just as God’s Word appears to dominate the world beneath it in the pictura. The lyrical “I” wishes to experience the benefits of  God’s Word upon his heart: the Word should make him or her want to turn away from earthly distractions. This message is repeated underneath the pictura. A quote from the Bible is used to represent God’s voice. His words are subsequently redirected into a lesson learned by the lyrical “I”: Heaven and Earth will perish, But my words will not perish. Heaven and the earth will perish But you, Lord, stay on.88 In the accompanying prose explanation, Heyns quotes from the Bible to express the same message once again, paraphrasing 1 John 1–3: “The tool and means used by God to create all things, is solely that almighty Word, which was with God in the beginning, yeah, was God indeed.”89 The priority and strength of  God’s Word is therefore reinforced over and over again at the beginning of  Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes. Although Heyns is not openly diminishing the importance of  the visual, the em- phasis on the dominance of  the word exemplifies the textual element of his emblems and their textual reception. Heyns’s religious emblems were defended not only by himself  but also by Joost van den Vondel, who was one of  the most prominent and out- spoken Dutch poets at the time and who had a complex and shifting 87 “Al wat ter werelt is sijn tijt heeft, ’tsal vergaen / ’t Gesternte vallen sal, geen ding en sal bestaen / Gods woort, Gods heylich woordt, in eeuwicheyt sal duren / Is van begin geweest en schept noch t’allen uren / Syn willen in het woord, ’twoord in syn willen leeft / Door ’t woord na synen wil ons ’t licht geschapen heeft: / Schept een reyn hert in my, o woord, myn God en Heere / Op dat ick ’taerds verlaet en willich tot u keere” (Heyns, Emblemes chres- tiennes, fol. A1v). 88 “Hemel en aarde zullen vergaen / Maer myne woorden sullen niet vergaen. / Hemel en de aerde sullen vergaen / Maer ghy Heere blyft” (ibid., fol. A2r). 89 “Het werctuyg enden den middel daer door God alle dingen geschapen heeft, is alleen dat almachtich Woord, ’twelck in den beginne by God was, Ia God selfs” (ibid., fol. A2r). </page> <page sequence="28"> 246 Dutch Religious Emblems denominational affiliation just like Heyns’, in a preliminary poem to the Emblemes chrestiennes et morales. Vondel praises Heyns for his choice of  imagery: his “Christian images” succeed in connecting the human mind with “God’s nature and his Presence”: Come forth, contemplative soul, and create Godly wealth, From Heyns’s sacred Rime and Christian images: Not images that arouse the mood negatively By carrying the Godless appearance of  the Goddess Venus: Rather, they disengage our thought from idleness, and transport our Spirit far beyond all Stars, Until it tastes Heaven, just as it is heavenly, And resembles God’s nature and his Presence. I think I’m there already—I am floating, wholly exuberant. I was blind in the realm of  the Earth; here my eyes are opened. I can see true Salvation through Zacharias’s eyeglasses, It is turbulent below; peaceful here above.90 Vondel’s poem is a compliment that, as was recently concluded by Karel Porteman and Mieke Smits-Veldt in their literary history Een nieuw vader- land voor de muzen, would not have been misplaced in the context of  the Jesuits’ emblematics.91 However, Vondel appears to surpass Heyns’s pur- poses: Heyns’s imagery does not function as a means to “transport our Spirit far beyond all Stars.” His images serve rather to visualize some key confessional doctrines of  Protestant faith and have limited beneficial effect beyond this representation. One remarkable emblem seems to move beyond the Protestant doctrine at the time. In emblem 4, Heyns explicitly pleads for religious tolerance, a plea already made in the Dutch Republic by Dirck Coornhert at the end of  the sixteenth century but disregarded or forgotten by Protestants in the Dutch Republic during their controversies in the first quarter of  the seven- teenth century.92 During the Synod of  Dordt (1618–19), the bounds of tolerance and religious freedom were narrowed as religious disputes 90 “Komt ingetogen Ziel, schept Goddelijcke weelden / Uyt Heynsens heylich Rijm, en Christeliicke beelden: / Gheen beelden, die ’t gemoed aenprickelen tot min / En ’t Godloos Outer voen van Venus de Goddin: / Maer ons gedachtenis van d’ydelheyt ontwarren / En voeren onse Gheest verr’ boven alle Sterren / Tot dat hy ’t Hemels smaeckt, geliic hy Hemelsch is / En swijmt na Godes aerd, en sijn geliickenis. / My dunct ick bender al, ick sweef  gants opghetoghen. / Op ’t aerdrijck was ic blind: hier krijgh ic open oogen. / Ic sie ’twarachtich Heyl door Zacharias bril. / Beneden ist gevvoel: hier boven isset stil” (Joost van den Vondel, preliminary poem, in Heyns, Emblemes chrestiennes, fol. A2v). 91 Porteman and Smits-Veldt, Een nieuw vaderland, 484. 92 Dirck Coornhert’s main work, Zedekunst dat is Wellevenkunste [Ethics, that is, the art of  living well] (1586) aimed at the training of  human willpower led by true knowledge, which was provided by reason, not by theological doctrines. </page> <page sequence="29"> History of Religions 247 within the Dutch Reformed Church between Remonstrants (Arminians) and Contra-Remonstrants (Calvinists) reached a climax, resulting, for in- stance, in the execution of  the political leader (and Remonstrant) Johan van Oldenbarnevelt in 1619 and the removal of  Remonstrant ministers from their ministries after 1618.93 The quintessence of  these disputes was centered on the meaning and role of  God’s Word in establishing the contours of  the new faith and on the conviction that God’s Word could have only a single meaning. In this matter, precisely, tolerance was hard to find. From the perception of Calvinists, the right interpretation of  the Word ought to provide the foun- dation of  the Reformed Church. Hence, for example, the decision, taken at the Synod of  Dordt, to have the Bible translated into Dutch from the original Hebrew and Greek (known as the Statenvertaling, the Dutch States Bible) and the search for verbal rituals (formulae for baptism and com- munion) that could give shape to the sacraments of  the church. In these circumstances, a growth of  religious tolerance was needed to guarantee a greater acceptance for Roman Catholic elements as applied in the religious emblems. For that reason, Heyns depicts in emblem 4 (see fig. 10) a landscape—the famous Vale of  Tempe, whose beauty was celebrated by ancient poets, for example by Virgil in the Georgics. In this landscape, people are peacefully enjoying each other’s company; Heyns sees a parallel between the Vale of  Tempe and an exemplary church: “An example of  the church, where many folk / Would like to live with a greater peace of  mind.”94 And he wishes all controversies to end, so that this ex- emplary church will come into existence: “God give that the Root of  all disputes, apart from damaging ambition, shall once be buried, so that the Church really compares to the most pleasant valley.”95 Accommoda- tion of  religious difference was thus pleaded through de-emphasizing the boundaries between the various communities of  faith. Heyns’s plea for tolerance did not result in the wide acceptance of  the religious emblem among the leading group of  Protestants in the Dutch Republic, and his Emblemes chrestiennes et morales was never re- printed. As one of  the anonymous poets of  a preliminary poem to the Emblemes chrestiennes predicted with foresight,96 it would take decades before Heyns’s initiative came to be appreciated by Protestant poets and 93 One of  the removed ministers was Camphuysen; consequently, his Stichtelijke rijmen was published secretly in 1624. See Schenkeveld, Dutch Literature in the Age of Rembrandt, 51. 94 “Een voor-beeld vande Kerck, waer inne menich mensch / Geruster van gemoet sou leven na syn wensch” (Heyns, Emblemes chrestiennes, fol. B3v). 95 “God geve dat de Wortel van alle oneenicheden beneven de schadelijcke eersucht eenmael soo ghedempt werde, dat de Kercke te recht by het vermaekelijckste dal vergeleken mach worden” (ibid., fol. C1r). 96 See ibid., fol. iiir. </page> <page sequence="30"> 248 Dutch Religious Emblems Fig. 10.—“Non Zephyris agitate Tempe,” pictura in Zacharias Heyns’s Em- blemes chrestiennes et morales (Rotterdam: Pieter van Waesberge, 1625), fol.

In Luyken’s emblems, realistic representations, as well as reflections of  the reader’s own inner world, invite the reader to reflect 97 Two works—Bartholomeus Hulsius’s Emblemata sacra of Geestelyke sinnebeelden (1631) and Cornelis P. Biens’s Handtboecxken der Christelijcke Gedichten, Sinnebeelden ende Liedekens (1635, 2nd and illustrated ed.)—would, according to their titles, fall into the category of  “religious Protestant emblem book” for the period between 1629 and 1653. Both volumes, however, can be characterized as “moralistic” rather than “religious.” 98 See Ernestine van der Wall, “Petrus Serrarius (1600–1669) et l’interprétation de l’Écri- ture,” Cahiers Spinoza 5 (1984–85): 187–217. </page> <page sequence="31"> History of Religions 249 upon the eternal and the divine. Just like Hugo, Luyken emphasized the importance of  the visual and the use of  the eye. In Luyken’s view, earthly and human beauty offers a glimpse of  God’s eternal beauty; man and nature are not a reflection of  the divine but, rather, a part of  divinity. The theme of  “looking” is prominent in Luyken’s texts as well as in his pic- turae: viewing holes (looking out into the distance, the heavenly), for in- stance, invite the reader to further studying.99 Luyken’s example was soon followed by other Protestant emblematists. Their work rapidly became widely popular: there was a succession of  numerous reprints in a short period of  time, and printers aimed at making the emblems available to a large public by publishing affordable editions or reprints of  the picturae that were to be sold separately.100 in conclusion Heyns combined the characteristics of  his own religious denomination with that of  another, accepting Roman Catholic image material as a means to bolster confessional faith and to stimulate the viewer’s senses without adding the Catholic emotional overtone to it and found himself  needing to defend this choice in the first emblem of  his collection. To enable his religious emblems to function among a Protestant audience and dissemi- nate Protestant ideas, he altered and adapted the Roman Catholic imagery and its function, emphasizing the dominance of  the word and the func- tion of  sound rather than sight. What do Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes et morales tell us about interconfessional relations, the interaction in the devotional practices of Protestant and Roman Catholic congregations and the way in which de- votional cultures define religious difference? On the one hand, the very existence of  the Emblemes chrestiennes et morales indicates that icono- clastic sentiments no longer restricted Protestant poetics. Heyns was appar- ently allowed to produce his religious emblems and to have them printed and distributed. The financial investment needed to create the Emblemes chrestiennes et morales—as far as we know, this investment was made by Heyns’s publisher, Van Waesberge—can also be seen as an implied commitment to Heyns’s ideological intentions.101 99 See Els Stronks, “The Revival of  the Dutch Love Emblem,” Emblematica 15 (2007): 319–42. 100 See Els Stronks, “Dutch Religious Love Emblems: Reflections of  Faith and Toleration in the Later Seventeenth Century,” Literature and Theology 23 (2009): 142–64. 101 Only seven copperplates (not the ones discussed in this article) were ever reused. They can be found in Maria Heyns’s Bloemhof der doorluchtige voorbeelden (published by Van Waesberge in 1647; Maria was the daughter of  Heyns’s brother Jacques). The publication of Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes et morales therefore proved to be a costly and unprofitable enterprise for Van Waesberge. We know the actual printing of  the Emblemes chrestiennes et morales was not done by Van Waesberge himself; he probably hired Jan Pieterszoon Walpot, </page> <page sequence="32"> 250 Dutch Religious Emblems As a businessman, Van Waesberge perhaps hoped to profit from a con- cealed interest in meditational literature among Protestants in the Dutch Republic. But even in its adjusted form, the religious emblem was not cordially welcomed in the Dutch Republic around 1625, as can be con- cluded from Heyns’s solitary and exceptional position among contempo- rary Protestant emblematists and from the lack of  success of  his Emblemes chrestiennes et morales. The existence of  Heyns’s Emblemes chrestiennes et morales also shows us that some Dutch Protestants indeed—supplementary to what Mochizuki concluded—tried to re-create passionate devotion through the use of  de- votional imagery. Heyns’s emblems not only invoked reflection on the tenets of  belief; they also stimulated the mind to visualize representa- tions of  the Holy Trinity or the unity of  Christ and the believer. Heyns’s efforts to evoke such responses with his religious emblems seem to co- incide with Willem Teellinck’s attempts to move the Dutch Reformed Church beyond reformation in doctrine and polity to reformation in life and practice. Teellinck published theological and spiritual works such as the Sleutel der devotie openende de deure des Hemels voor ons (The key of  devotion opening the door of  heaven for us), published in 1624, a two- volume work of  dialogues that address questions about spiritual and practical Christian living.102 In his works, following the footsteps of  the English Puritans, Teellinck emphasized Reformed spirituality and the en- joyment of  sweet communion with Christ. According to Teellinck, sincere devotion to Christ—executed in the accurate and conscientious reading of  his Word—was the means of  experiencing a vibrant communion with Christ.103 Teellinck’s opinions on the need of  spiritual enhancement of one’s faith certainly did not govern the Reformed Church at the time, just as the input of  other denominations on this issue was hardly welcomed or a Protestant printer from Delft, to manufacture the printed text (see Meeus, Zacharias Heyns, uitgever en toneelauteur, 291). A handlist of  Van Waesberge’s total output shows that the rest of  his surviving religious imprints all have Calvinistic origins (an emblem book by Cats, a catechism by Franciscus Ridderus, and theological treaties by Teellinck, for instance: see Van Mameren, “Fondslijst van Pieter van Waesberghe”). Additional research in archival sources could reveal Van Waesberge’s motives to publish the Emblemes chrestiennes et morales. An exemplary case of  the confluence of  a printer-publisher’s religious ideology and his trade is described in Peter McCullough, “Print, Publication, and Religious Politics in Caroline England,” Historical Journal 51 (2008): 285–313. 102 In fact, the striving for a more spiritual status in the Reformed Church was never absent in the history of  the Northern Netherlands, as is testified, for instance, by the work of  David Joris and Coornhert, who both propagated the idea that service to God should have its seat in the heart of  men, in “faith working through love.” See Miriam G. K. van Veen, “Spiritualism in the Netherlands: From David Joris to Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert,” Sixteenth-Century Journal 33 (2002): 129–50, quote on 129. 103 See Herman Westerink, Met het oog van de ziel.

The fact that he never became a member of  the Calvinist, Anabaptist, or Remonstrant church seems to have given him the kind of independence needed to use the achievements of  the Roman Catholic emblematic tradition for his own purposes. It can hardly have been a coincidence that Vondel—a kindred free spirit—supported Heyns’s en- deavors, while both Cats and de Brune, being fervent Calvinists, were more restricted by their confessional engagement and did not follow Heyns’s footsteps. In contrast to Russell’s thesis on the progressive desacralization of  the image, the Dutch case shows that the religious image did not turn into an empty rhetorical vessel in the Dutch Republic in beginning of  the seven- teenth century.107 Ideology still played a part in the use and choices of word and image that could be made by Protestant poets in the Dutch Re- public around 1625. When we take into account that Heyns was not a member of  any specific denomination and that almost all the Protestant emblematists who worked after 1680 were Anabaptists, we realize that the transmission of  Roman Catholic culture was initiated by representatives of  a denomination that was not dominant in the Dutch Republic during the seventeenth century.108 They created a visual piety that eventually 104 See Joel R. Beeke and Randall J. Pederson, “Dutch Further Reformation Divines: Willem Teellinck,” in Meet the Puritans: With a Guide to Modern Reprints (Grand Rapids, MI: Reformation Heritage Books, 2006), 785–86. 105 As Ferdinand van Ingen concluded, the reception of  Pers’s edition of  Arndt’s Vier Bücher vom wahren Christentum (1605) seemed to be restricted to a small group of  (Lu- theran) readers in the Netherlands in the first half  of  the seventeenth century. See Ferdinand van Ingen, “De receptie van Johann Arndt in Nederland,” Documentatieblad Nadere Refor- matie 29 (2005), 3–15. 106 On these two editions, see Ralph Dekoninck, “Imagines Peregrinantes: The Interna- tional Genesis and Fate of  Two Biblical Picture Books (Barrefelt and Nadal) Conceived in Antwerp at the End of  the Sixteenth Century,” in Intersections: Yearbook for Early Modern Studies 3 (Leiden, 2004), 49–64, esp. 57. 107 Russell’s case is also weakened by Ernest Gilman’s findings that Quarles made slight, but meaningful, changes in Hugo’s picturae to please his Protestant readers (Gilman, Icono- clasm and Poetry, chap. 4). 108 Moreover, most of  them were operating in Amsterdam, a city and region known for its relative toleration of  Roman Catholics. </page> <page sequence="34"> 252 Dutch Religious Emblems diminished the distinction between Protestant and Roman Catholic atti- tudes toward the image.109 Rather than becoming an empty rhetorical vessel, the religious image regained power in the Dutch Republic with the revival of  the religious love emblem at the end of  the seventeenth century. As it developed, the specific combination of  word, image, and religion found in the emblematic genre seems to have thwarted acceptance rather than to have accelerated it. The use of  imagery as described by Mochizuki, the tekstborden in the Protestant churches, does not involve the blending of  the visual and the textual. This leaves the question of  whether the image would perhaps have been more readily accepted by Protestants if  it had not been accompanied by words. Perhaps the combination of  word and image in the emblem collided with restrictions based on Protestant ideology, while ideological controversies were absent from the purely visual arts, in which such mingling of  image and word was rare at the time. Similar problems seem to have occurred in another art form in which word and image were combined: early modern theater was, despite its secularism, subjected to Calvinist attacks grounded in specifically moral and religious terms.110 Heyns’s failed attempt to introduce an aspect of  Roman Catholic culture into Dutch literature thus reinforces and amplifies the conclusion recently drawn by Parker in Faith on the Margins that although confessional co- existence was practiced in the Dutch Republic, the Dutch Catholics—being a minority—were restricted in displaying their confession in the public sphere.111 As a matter of  fact, even among Roman Catholics in the Dutch Republic, hymns rather than religious emblems seem to have served for the instruction and comfort of  the faithful in the beginning of  the seven- teenth century.112 These restrictions were extended to the Protestant ma- 109 In Bibles, the same development appears to occur: the first editions of  the Calvinistic Dutch Bible, the so-called Dutch States Bible (1637), were not illustrated, but a collection of six maps later in the seventeenth century became the standard minimum of  illustration for the Dutch States Bibles. The Dutch Bibles for Anabaptists and Remonstrants contained more illustrations (engravings of, e.g., the Dutch artists Christoffel van Sichem, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Claes Janszoon Visscher). See Peter van der Coelen, “Pictures for the People? Bible Illustrations and their Audience,” in Lay Bibles in Europe, 1450–1800, ed.

Also, the first results of  the “Pia Desideria-Project” at Universiteit Leuven and Utrecht University show that the Roman Catholic publisher Pieter Jacobszoon Paets in 1628 could not print his edition of  the Pia Desideria in Amsterdam; instead, he was using a printer’s address in Antwerp.

It is very well possible that the privacy of  their homes offered opportunities for Protestants’ appropriation of  Roman Catholic literature, but in the openly published emblem books such outspoken allusions were unwanted. Even though there were substantial areas of borrowing and overlap in the use of  devotional literature,113 these prac- tices and precepts could not be freely shared between the different con- fessions on the public production side. By 1625, the process of  defining “the self” while rebuking “the other” had not yet stopped.
