<plain_text><page sequence="1">PALM TREES AND THE PATHETIC FALLACY IN ARCHAIC GREEK POETRY AND ART The pathos has largely gone out of the pathetic fallacy.* It was not so in 1856 when John Ruskin invented the term so that he could vilify its improper use by poets such as Pope.1 For Ruskin the fallacy-that "falseness in all our impres- sions of external things"--had to be generated by "violent feelings" or by a weak temperament "borne away, or over-clouded, or over-dazzled by emo- tion.'"2 If there is no passion there can be no pathetic fallacy. Modem defini- tions, however, no longer consider a pathos such as agony or grief the essential or only admissible source of the fallacy. Today it is generally regarded simply as a variety of personification that, in M. H. Abrams' definition, "animates, not abstractions, but concrete particulars, by attributing life, emotion, and physiognomy to objects of the physical world."' 3 The pathetic fallacy is widely held to operate when there is any projection of human traits into nature or its animate or inanimate parts (trees, calves, rocks, waves) whatever the stimulus-passion, "contemplative fancy, "4 or cold-blooded convention. The issue addressed here is not which definition-Ruskin's narrow one or the modem dictionary's broader one-is correct, or what constitutes appropriate use of the pathetic fallacy and what does not. The issue is whether the Greeks of the Archaic period (before 480 B.C) were spiritually or intellectually capable of the trope, and the issue is immediately and permanently clouded by the ease with which the Greeks anthropomorphized nature and invested it with the supernatural. Unless one takes care, religious belief can be mistaken for figure of speech, especially by a scholarship in which Romantic attitudes remain pervasive.5 For instance, is the personified Fala who in the Homeric Hymn to *I would like to thank Professor C. J. Herington of Yale University for his kind advice and three anonymous readers for their comments. 'Modern Painters, Vol. III, Part IV (New York, 1857) Chapter xii. Ruskin does not condemn the trope per se: there is good pathetic fallacy and there is bad. It is always improper and bad when "it is found in the thoughts of the poet himself" (p. 170), who thus loses contact with fact and truth. But it is proper and effective when two conditions are met: (a) it must be found "in the thoughts of the characters imagined by [the poet]" (p. 170) and (b) the emotion that gives rise to it must be "genuine" and sufficiently powerful. If the feeling is true, the distortion of reality is acceptable, even pleasing (p. 164). Since the fallacy, when properly used, tells us more about the speaker's state of mind than about his physical environment, it can still be faithful to truth, if not to nature. See George P. Landow, The Aesthetic and Critical Theories of John Ruskin (Princeton, 197 1) 382-3. 2Ruskin (above, n. 1) 159, 162. In this Ruskin simply agreed with Wordsworth; see M. H. Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp (Oxford, 1953) 292. 3Abrams (above n. 2) 291. 4Ruskin (above n. 1) 159, specifically separates the pathetic fallacy from the "fallacy of wilful fancy," a distortion of nature caused not by pathos but by wit; see also Modern Painters, Vol. II, Part III, Sec. II, Chapter iv. Modern definitions tend not to admit the distinction. 5Thomas G. Rosenmeyer in The Green Cabinet (Berkeley, 1969) has warned that the pathetic fallacy may not even be relevant to Greek literature: "Given the Greek tendency to hypostatize nature into woodland creatures and mythological fancies, does it make sense to apply the 193</page><page sequence="2">194 JEFFREY M.

If not, and if lines 13 and 14 are taken as a genuine instance of the pathetic fallacy, how can Earth's divinity have faded so fast? Are the sky and sea themselves conceived as anthropomorphic gods here or as simple elements of the natural world momentarily given a human sense of humor? Are there, in fact, degrees of divinity? And would not lines 13 and 14 have meant one thing to the Greek and the Archaic period and quite another to the Greek of, say, the Hellenistic period, a more self-conscious, sophisticated, and academic age? Not all of these questions have ready answers, but they cannot be put out of mind. Adam Parry once ruled a priori that the pathetic fallacy could not exist in early Greek literature. The figure, he argued, is predicated upon man's aliena- tion from nature, his sense of its "otherness," and his need to establish a relationship to it, however artificial. These conditions are not met in "the youth of a culture," as Parry called it, for "there is no awful gap to be bridged between man and nature: they live in the same world, a world which can be called 'natural' in a wider, and older, sense. The poet does not have to make contact between himself and nature by attributing his emotions to the latter."6 C. P. Segal concurs: in the world revealed by Archaic poetry "Man is too close to nature, too much a part of its movements and rhythms, and too directly dependent on them for his own life, physical and moral, to feel that nature sympathizes with his sufferings or his inward sorrows."7 Citing Levy-Bruhl's loi de participation, on the other hand, Bernard F. Dick has come to the opposite conclusion: "The origins of the pathetic fallacy probably lie in a primitive homeopathy . . wherein man regarded himself as part of his natural surroundings.'"8 And in an early article, Frank O. Copley found pathetic fallacies almost everywhere he looked in Archaic poetry; he cites examples from Homer (whom Ruskin had exonerated from the charge), Hesiod, Solon, Archilochus, Semonides, Alcaeus, Sappho, Alcman, Ibycus and Simonides, whose poem on Danae contained "perhaps the clearest example of pathetic fallacy in all early Greek literature."9 nineteenth-century yardstick, product of realism and scientism, of the pathetic fallacy?" (248). We would also do well to remember that even Thales, the founder of natural philosophy, somehow believed that "all things are full of gods;" see G. Kirk and D. S. Raven, The Presocratic Philosophers (Cambridge, 1957) 93ff. 6"Landscape in Greek Poetry," YCS 15 (1957) 3-29; 5. Parry does not specify how long "the youth" of Greek culture lasted, but he seems to place Greek poets from Homer to the tragedians within it (p. 7). The maturity of Greek culture and the development of another attitude toward nature-one that could admit the pathetic fallacy-began with Plato (p. 29). 7"Nature and the World of Man in Greek Literature," Arion 2 (1963) 19-53; 47. 8"Ancient Pastoral and the Pathetic Fallacy," Comparative Literature 20 (1968) 27-44; 27. Dick offers Gilgamesh's lament for Enkidu, in which all kinds of beasts, a mountain, and a river are said to weep, as an early example (p. 27-28). One wonders whether Parry would have considered Gilgamesh the product of a culture's youth or not. For the pathetic fallacy's origin in "naive animism," see also A. S. Pease, "Notes on the Pathetic Fallacy in Latin Poetry," CJ 22 (1926) 645-657; 646f.

There can be little doubt that Copley cast too wide a net. Archilochus' simple apostrophe to "great earth" (Diehl, 16), or Solon's political allegory (Diehl, 11), or Sappho's sublime creation of mood (Diehl, 5), to cite just a few examples, do not qualify as pathetic fallacies even by the most liberal modem definition, much less Ruskin's, since nature is not specifically invested with any human feelings, abilities, or characteristics, real or potential.10 Parry and Segal are probably right that the urbanized, scientific culture of the Hellenistic age offered inherently more fertile ground than Archaic culture for the growth of a figure that attempted to close the widening gulf between alienated man and nature."1 No one questions that the fallacy exists in Theocritus,12 or that Moschus' "Lament for Bion" is really little else. Yet perhaps Segal's view that nature must empathize in order for the pathetic fallacy to exist would have been too narrow even for Ruskin: a mournful or aggrieved nature is not the only acceptable kind.13 To say that the pathetic fallacy either existed in Archaic poetry or did not may, in any case, be the wrong way of putting the problem, since what is generally lumped together under that single heading should actually be broken down into at least three distinct parts. (1) The apathetic fallacy, the fallacy without pathos (the kind that in Ruskin's opinion gave the whole trope a bad name), in which nature is simply given human traits or capacities but does not specifically respond or refer to anything outside of itself: for instance, a pine tree sweetly sings and whispers at the beginning of Idyll I (lines 1-2). In this category of fallacy, nature itself may have emotions but they do not reflect the poet's or speaker's own; however humanized it may be, nature is external, and man may even be absent. It is difficult to decide whether literal belief in the animism of nature has stopped and figurative language has begun at Iliad 13.27-29 where the sea makes way for the sea-god Poseidon "in joy" {ynr8Ooo-iv3}; make of it what you will, as Ruskin might say. But when Semonides in his "Satire on Women" (Diehl, 7) says the sea often "rages" or "goes mad" {tLaiveTaLt, line 39) or has a feminine disposition (line 42), we may come closer to the apathetic fallacy. A fragment of Alcman (Diehl, 58), though clearly out of context,14 is as it stands a '0Copley's reading of the Sappho (above n. 9, p. 205) must yield to D. Page's: see Sappho and Alcaeus (Oxford, 1955) 34ff, and especially the note on line 8 (p. 37). That Sappho here and elsewhere created a mood that seems to embrace both nature and human beings cannot be denied, but that is not pathetic fallacy. Neither is the one early Greek example offered by Dick (above n. 8, p. 28-29): Iliad 18, 35-67, where Thetis and the Nereids respond to Achilles' grief. That is personification or myth. I"The pathetic fallacy of the Romantic poets had a similar source; see Abrams (above n. 2) 64-65. 12Rosenmeyer (above n. 5) 249, however, plays down the role of the fallacy in Theocritus. "'Ruskin's own programmatic example of effective pathetic fallacy, from Kingsley's "Alton Locke," presents a hostile nature: "They rowed her in across the rolling foam- The cruel, crawling foam." 14That this most basic kind of fallacy seems to exist in Archaic poetry should not, perhaps, cause any surprise, since its almost exact opposite does as well. This is the metaphor in which the world of man acts like the world of nature: Hesiod's righteous city (Works, 227), for instance, "blooms" {TEO'7AXe} and its people "flowers" {dvOEOtrLV}. See Segal, (above, n. 7) 27.</page><page sequence="4">196 JEFFREY M. HURWIT good example: the mountain peaks and gullies, the headlands and streams and forest, are all asleep, and so is a wide assortment of beasts and birds. Animals can sleep, of course; mountains and trees cannot. Perhaps Alcman was setting up the dramatic entry of a god.15 If so, these lines would properly represent the apathetic fallacy, but if he went on to contrast nature's sleep with the turbulent sleeplessness of a human character, then they would belong instead to the next category. (2) The antipathetic fallacy, in which man and nature are estranged.16 This fallacy is generally the product of pathos but here nature does not show emotion or refuses to respond to a human spectator when, it is supposed, it can and ought to commiserate. The fallacious attribution of human abilities to nature is often only implicit here. In Idyll II, the distraught Simaetha contrasts the silence of the sea and winds with her own sorrow and anger, which will not be silent in her own breast (lines 38-39). The sea and the winds can be relatively silent, and there is nothing false about saying they are. But Simaetha's intense pathos makes nature seem heartless, and heartlessness is a human trait. Whatever the true meaning of lines 13 and 14 of the Hymn to Demeter may be, line 23 seems a case of the antipathetic fallacy: the fruit-bearing olive trees are as deaf to Persephone's cries as the gods and men. In a fragment of Anacreon, an unnamed but "well-known" woman who thinks piteous thoughts wishes to be thrown into the implacable or cruel {dc.LEtXLXOV} sea.17 And one of the most pathetic of all Archaic poems, Simonides' Danae fragment, probably belongs to the antipathetic type: the raging, violent sea shows no mercy for Danae, who begs it to sleep.1" Nature here is not impassive (and thus merely reproachable), like Simaetha's sea or the Homeric hymn's olive trees, but actively hostile. Danae does not project her distress onto nature but is overwhelmed by it. Still, the sea does not sleep despite her entreaty: implicity, it refuses to console. (3) The sympathetic or empathetic fallacy, in which human feelings (most often grief) are ascribed to nature so that it seems to respond to the poet or character. This is, perhaps, the kind of fallacy most often equated with the pathetic fallacy as a whole, yet it owes its familiarity primarily to Latin poetry, not Greek.19 A famous Hellenistic instance of adynaton20 is often counted an example: in Idyll I, lines 132-136, Daphnis demands that the natural world turn itself inside out, as it were, in response to his imminent death. He calls upon the brambles to bear violets, the pines to grow pears, the hounds to fear the hind, and so on: in its confusion nature would show sympathy for his suffering.21 But although 15See D. A. Campbell Greek Lyric Poetry (London, 1967) 221. Also, C. M. Bowra, Greek Lyric Poetry (Oxford, 1961) 70f. 16The antipathetic fallacy was first defined by Pease (above n. 8) 651-652. '7See Bowra (above n. 15) 280. Anacreon's diLpihLXov Tro6vov does not seem very different from Kinsley's "cruel, crawling foam" (above n. 13).

I wonder if the origins of this kind of adynaton might not be found in Archilochus' poem on the</page><page sequence="5">PALM TREES 197 Archaic poetry contains at least a few examples of the apathetic and antipathetic fallacies, sympathetic fallacies are extremely hard, if not impossible, to find. At the mouth of his cave, the blind Polyphemus asks his ram why he is uncustomarily the last to leave and imagines that the beast misses or longs for {7roOEELt} his master's eye (Odyssey 9.452-53): Polyphemus imagines false- ly, but the fallacy nonetheless describes his grief truly. With this exception, however, the sympathetic fallacy does not exist in early Greek poetry as we have it. What is surprising is that it does exist where we least expect to find it: in Archaic art. There is no reason why it should: nature itself was simply not a subject the Greek artist-Archaic or Classical-was particularly interested in. Occasionally an Archaic vase-painter paid extraordinary attention to the world of nature-extraordinary, that is, for an Archaic vase-painter. The best known case is an East Greek cup of the mid-sixth century with a diminutive man set between two trees rising in opposite directions: the supple branches fill the field, and hidden among them are birds, a nest, a snake, and a cicada.22 But nature is rarely as luxuriant, green, and full as this in Archaic art: even on a late Black Figure amphora by the Antimenes Painter, where the subject is an olive harvest, the trees are spindly and their foliage sparse: two rows of leaves seem glued to each branch.23 Most human, heroic, or divine activity takes place without any natural backdrop at all (though Dionysos and his followers often carry their vines along with them, a kind of portable nature). But when there is some indication of landscape, it is usually the same, small, almost bare tree: nature as it is revealed in Archaic Greek art is strikingly consistent, and consistently desiccated.24 Nature practically never exists for its own sake in Archaic art, and it is never symbolic of mood-except for two remarkable palm trees. Exekias painted one of them, probably in the 530s, on his famous amphora in Boulogne depicting the suicide of Ajax-rather the preparations for his solar eclipse (Diehl, 74), where a similar inversion of nature, the speaker says, would not be surprising. 22M. Robertson, Greek Painting (Geneva, 1959) 69. 23J. Boardman , Athenian Black Figure Vases (Oxford, 1974) fig. 186. The same kind of tree appears in the diving scene on the lid of the Greek-painted sacrophagus from the Tomb of the Diver at Paestum (c. 480); see M. Robertson, A History of Greek Art (Cambridge, 1975) 240f, and plate 84c. This is one of the very few Greek paintings of around or before 480 that is not a vase-painting, and it is evidence that the Archaic Greek wall- or panel-painter's conception of nature may not have been much different from the Archaic Greek vase-painter's. The sea, incidentally, is represented as a low mound, as it is in one scene on the much earlier Frangois vase; Boardman, fig. 46.4. 24The tree engraved and painted on the Olive Tree pediment from the Acropolis (c. 560) is a notable and flourishing exception; see M. Brouskari, The Acropolis Museum (Athens, 1974) fig. 74. Withered nature continues to be painted at least down to the beginning of the Hellenistic period. On the "Alexander Mosaic" from Pompeii (a second-century copy of a painting of around 300) a large, apparently dead tree rises behind Alexander, and somehow in its leaflessness seems an appropriate and moody setting for the depicted slaughter and for Darius' pathos; see Robertson (above, n. 23) 497 ff., and plate 155. See now also the several leafless trees of the "Hunting Frieze" painted on the facade of the recently discovered Royal Tomb at Vergina; see M.

HURWIT suicide.25 The hero crouches to plant his sword in a mound of Trojan earth and stares transfixed at the blade. To the right, his armor, the symbol of Homeric heroism, rests against the edge of the panel: the helmet even seems to watch. To the left, behind Ajax, a tall palm tree wilts; its fronds droop low as if in mourning for the hero about to die.26 Just how much nature, in the form of this single tree, participates in--and, in fact, helps create--the heavy, near-tragic atmosphere of the scene can best be appreciated by comparing a scene of explicit sorrow on the name vase of the Painter of the Vatican Mourner (perhaps a follower of Exekias):27 admidst two plane trees and two evergreens (a veritable forest by Archaic standards), a woman blots away a tear and pulls her hair in grief for the fallen warrior lying on a bed of branches at her feet (his helmet looks away). Suffering is here given an extensive natural setting, but nature does not reflect human sorrow or try to console the mourner;28 it stands objectively in opposition to grief. Exekias' tree does not. The second sympathetic palm appears on a hydria in Naples by the Kleo- phrades Painter (ca. 490-480).29 The scene is the Sack of Troy: Aeneas escapes with Anchises on his back and Ascanios at his side; Ajax, son of Oileus, strides menacingly toward Cassandra, who clings to the palladion; Neoptolemos hacks away at Priam, who sits on an altar with the bloodied corpse of Astyanax across his lap. Behind Priam a Trojan woman sits mournfully at the base of a palm tree (the only element of Nature depicted on the vase), and it seems to mourn with her: it bends all its leaves to one side, forming a canopy over the grieving woman. At the same time it seems broken by the despair and brutality around it--"an astonishing symbol of the whole scene of ruin," according to Robertson,30 and itself a victim of the violence. There is not much nature here, but there is no gulf between it and human beings. These are only two vases and Exekias and the Kleophrades Painter were exceptional and forward-looking artists. But their use of nature to reflect and intensify human sorrow suggests that the sympathetic fallacy, despite the evidence of extant Archaic poetry, was not beyond the reach of the Archaic Greek imagination.31 And if Archaic vase-painters could conceive of the trope, 25Boardman (above, n. 23) fig. 101. 26For normal palm trees, see Robertson (above, n. 24) plate 41b, and Boardman (above, n. 23) fig. 227. 27Boardman (above, n. 23) fig. 134. 28Were this not a vase-painting but a poem, it might have been an example of the antipathetic fallacy. But since it is a painting there is no human voice to comment upon nature's pitilessness or failure to empathize. No such voice is needed for painted sympathetic fallacies- we can see nature's response for ourselves-and perhaps the sympathetic fallacy is the only kind that Archaic art can truly present. 29Boardman, Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Archaic Period (London, 1975) fig. 135. 30Robertson (above, n. 23) 234. 31It also may not have been far from the thoughts of Archaic Etruscan wall-painters, for whom nature seems to have played a much more important role than for their Greek contemporaries (see O. Brendel, Etruscan Art [Harmondsworth, 1978] 190). This is not the place to contrast Etruscan and Greek attitudes toward nature-some of the differences are obvious from a comparison of the Paestum diving scene (see n. 23) with that of the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing at Tarquinia. And Etruscan paintings cannot be used as evidence for patterns of Archaic Greek thought. Still, it is</page><page sequence="7">PALM TREES 199 it seems unreasonable to deny Archaic poets, however different their art, the same capacity. In any case, two lonely palm trees are enough to indicate that the Archaic Greek was not too much a part of nature to feel that it could sympathize with him after all. JEFFREY M. HURWIT University of Oregon interesting that the Etruscan artist often uses nature to amplify moods. The thriving, blossoming trees of many paintings seem almost to participate in the joyous dancing of human beings (e.g. Brendel, fig. 123). And in the Tomb of the Bulls (Brendel, fig. 109), a tree stands at the center of the mythological panel, between Achilles and Troilos; its blood-red color suggests Troilos' fate. The tree, incidentally, is a palm.</page></plain_text>
