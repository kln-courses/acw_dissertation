<plain_text><page sequence="1">Roman oscilla An assessment RABUN TAYLOR What is an oscillum? As it is used today, the term oscillum (oscilla in the plural) refers to two distinct but related things in the Roman world: in one case an artifact, in the other a historical construct. According to standard modern usage it was an object of marble worked in relief on both sides, probably painted, and suspended by a hook from the architrave or ceiling of a colonnaded portico.1 It tends to take one of three forms: tondo (a thin disk), pinax (a framed rectangle), or pelta (a broad, lunate shield). Small marble theater masks, usually hollowed out in the back, have sometimes been found in the company of conventional oscilla, most famously at the House of the Golden Cupids at Pompeii (fig. 1). All these objects are frequently depicted hanging from fictive colonnades or garlands in Pompeian frescoes. The reliefs appearing on oscilla are mostly typical Roman genre scenes dominated by Dionysiac and theatrical themes; occasionally a mythological vignette will appear in highly abbreviated form. Marble oscilla of the Roman west (a few have also been found in Athens) came into vogue only in the first century ce. and declined in popularity after the mid second century. Clearly their various forms were deemed interchangeable by the time they began to appear in permanent materials. But their eclecticism is not meaningless. Indeed, we should see their popularity in domestic contexts as a commodif?cation of a variety of ritual traditions on the Italian peninsula which extended back for centuries, and which shared one common feature: their meaning was defined or enhanced by the act of suspension. Although the scholarship on oscilla is not robust, a number of article-length studies, a dissertation, and a short monograph have appeared on the topic.2 These have been concerned not only with the oscillum as a material artifact, but with the Latin word oscillum from which the modern term is derived?a word so obscure that literary commentators in late antiquity could only speculate about it. To distinguish between the archaeological artifact, which is never directly referenced in any ancient text, and the lexicographic one, I will designate each by typeface: the former in roman, the latter in italic. My intention is not to establish an absolute distinction, but merely to place emphasis on one designation or the other. Since the nineteenth century, there has been a strange gulf between art historians, who tend to sidestep the literary construct too quickly, and the students of religion such as Franz Altheim and Jean-Louis Voisin, who deal at length with the literary sources and the various claims to ritual origins for oscilla but hardly acknowledge the existence of a physical corpus of suspended objects, let alone the extant representations of them in a variety of media.3 The question of origins This article investigates a range of possible primary functions?most of them ritual in nature?that underlie the more overtly semantic and aesthetic secondary 1. Marble plaques are not the only class of objects called oscilla. Railler lays out the problem of definition succinctly: "l'emploi indiscrimin? de ce terme comporte quelques inconv?nients, quand le m?me mot en vient ? d?signer des bas-reliefs de marbre du 1er s. ap. J.-C, des masques ou poup?es suspendus aux arbres dans de vieux cultes italiques, de petits m?daillons de terre cuite du IVe s. av. J.-C. trouv?s dans des tombes de Gr?ce ou de Sicile, ou m?me n'import quel masque, tympanon ou bouclier d'Amazone int?gr? ? un d?cor architectural" (Railler 1982:744, n. 5). Yet another class of oscilla, these made of terracotta, have been found in Gaul (Vertet 1975). This typological confusion is indeed unfortunate. But with the possible exception of the Greek and Sicilian evidence?mostly small terracotta objects of many forms with single or double holes for suspension?it is not out of place to group the other definitions within a continuum of traditions on the Italian peninsula associated with funerary rituals and Dionysiac cult. 2.

An oscillum signifies by means of at least four properties: form, context, disposition, and iconography. To the extent that the iconography carried on an oscillum refers back to the oscillum itself, as opposed to themes that were just as prevalent in many other media, it does so only in the most generalized way. The prevalence of Dionysiac and theatrical themes may suggest a primordial connection between oscilla and the Dionysus cult, but this kind of imagery is widespread across a broad spectrum of Roman domestic and ritual objects. My principal concern, therefore, is with form, context, and disposition of oscilla: the shapes that they take, their confinement to the liminal space of the colonnade, and their tendency to hang, and indeed, oscillate. M. Maurice Albert's early analysis of marble oscilla (1881) identified two possible paths by which they came into being. On the one hand, a passage of Vergil and the ancient scholiasts commenting on it suggest that the cult of Dionysus included a ritual of suspending small effigies in the form of masks from trees (Ceorgics 2.387-389). This is the only direct, unqualified usage of the term that survives from the classical period of Latin literature: "they [the people of Italy] put on hideous faces carved from bark, invoking you, Bacchus, with glad refrain; and for you they hang soft oscilla from the lofty pine/'4 From this passage was born the modern term for the archaeological artifact, together with the unshakable conviction that it is related to Dionysiac rituals. On the other hand, Maurice Albert observed, the Romans had adopted from the Greeks the practice of suspending votive shields in temples or colonnades to celebrate military victories.5 Honorary shields such as the imago clipeata and the clipeus virtutis were granted to outstanding citizens, even to the deceased, and were displayed prominently in temples. Both practices, he reasoned, made their mark in the little marble epigones of the Roman imperial period. But he took his argument 4. oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis, /et te, Bacche, vocant per carmina laeta, tibique / oscilla ex alta suspendu nt mol Ha pinu (Georgics 2.387-89). 5.

Jean-Marie P?iller in particular (1982:791-812) has proposed a reductive model. Believing many of the iconographie appurtenances of Dionysiac art and testimony to be fictions without any reference to historical practice, he contends that oscilla as a class are a part of these mythologizing impedimenta. Others are more inclined to see a broad variety of causes underlying the phenomenon of oscilla (Loisy 1999; Dwyer 1981). While their claim of eclecticism may be less intellectually satisfying than P?iller's strict reductionism, I contend that it is correct in principle, if not always in detail. Meaningful suspension: mimetic or amuletic? Besides Vergil, the only other surviving source to use the term oscillum before late antiquity comes from the pen of the antiquarian Varro?and only in a paraphrase from a late-antique scholiast who happens to be commenting on the Vergil passage: "Varro said offerings of appeasement were made to those who had been hanged, who were unworthy of prescribed ritual, with the hanging of oscilla, as if through imitation of the death/'7 Neither this source nor the Vergil passage actually describes oscilla but each in its own way suggests 1 ) that they were suspended; and 2) that they were effigies of some sort. In Vergil's case, they were perhaps the cork masks themselves; in Varro's, undefined "imitations." Ancient speculation on the oscillum also survives in commentaries on the passage in Vergil, most written in late antiquity. Some of them justify the Dionysiac tradition of hanging oscilla by their physical analogy to bodies of the hanged, specifically mythological figures who died by hanging.8 Several of these explanations have developed around a hard kernel of ritual truth: the placation of, or atonement for, the unburied dead. Since the nineteenth century, scholarship on oscilla has been preoccupied with the rituals of swinging and hanging. Most have thought the act of hanging objects from trees, as Vergil describes the ritual, to be a mimetic act. Early in the twentieth century scholars favored interpreting the development of sacrificial effigies as a substitution for older rites of expiatory human sacrifice (Bayet 1975 [1922]:294-299; Carcopino 1919:378-387; Nilsson 1915). Charles Picard (1928:58) suggests that the various myths compiled by the commentators may have been marshaled for the purpose of explaining the obscure ritual of hanging effigies from trees. Rather than represent humans, he proposes, they may have reflected some aspect of the gods, who themselves had arboreal origins. Rosanna Mazzacane (1980) sees two conflated rituals here: that of suspension, which represents the status of souls hovering between the earthly and heavenly realms; and that of oscillation, which represents the search of a restless spirit for whatever it seeks. Altheim (1931) suggests that an oscillum ritual, which according to one commentary was frequens in Italia,9 and which was appropriated by the Liber Dionysus cult because of that god's identity as a Maskengott, represented the souls of the restless dead; they were shades or ghosts (larvae, maniae) transmuted into little mask-effigies of Dionysus and his followers, then attached to a tree. The oscillation of these masks represents the souls and their restlessness. Altheim does not explain what this ritual is meant to accomplish. Does it grant the souls a means of atonement by "airing out" their imperfections, as Servius suggests in his commentary on the Georgics? Do the masks thereby "capture" the souls and make them their own, initiating them posthumously into the Dionysiac domain? 6. "Qu'un sculpteur. . . remplace les affreuses figures de Mania et les t?tes s?v?res des vieux Romains par de gracieux tableaux; que ... sa fantaisie capricieuse repr?sente des personnages et des sc?nes diverses, voil? des objets anciens compl?tement m?tamorphos?s" (Maurice Albert 1881:136). 7. Varro ait, suspendiosis, quibus iusta fieri ius non sit, suspensis oscillis, veluti per imitationem mortis parentari (Servius Auctus, Commentarius ad Aeneida 12.603). 8. Numerous sources try to connect Vergil's oscilla to the myth of Erigone, who hanged herself when she discovered the murdered corpse of her father, Icarius, the first human to be given the gift of wine by Dionysus; see Hyginus, Astron?mica 2.4; Hyginus, Fabulae 130; Servius, Commentarius ad Ge?rgica 2.389; Bern scholiast of Vergil, Georgics 2.389; scholiast of Statius, Thebaid 11.644; Pseudo Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.192; Aelian, De natura animalium 7.28. On the Ai?ra, the Attic festival of the grape to which this myth is attached, see Mazzacane 1980; Nilsson 1915. Others associate it with the mysterious death of King Latinus, who disappeared and was found hanging (Festus, p. 212 L, s.v. "oscillantes"; Servius, Brevis expositio ad Ge?rgica 2.389); or with Tarquinius Superbus, who responded to an epidemic of hanging suicides by ordering the bodies to be nailed to crosses in punishment (Servius Auctus, Commentarius adAeneida 12.603). Macrobius reports that oscilla were invented as surrogates for human heads offered to Dis, the underworld god {Saturnalia 1.7.31). 9. Probus, ad Ge?rgica 2.385.</page><page sequence="4">86 RES 48 AUTUMN 2005 The hypotheses just surveyed favor an oscillum ritual that is fundamentally mimetic, but the reason for mimesis is not always explained. A ritual must do more than simply signify; it must acf. Another school of thought prefers to interpret the suspension of oscilla as amuletic. According to Plutarch, dangling baubles weaken spirits' malicious intent (Moralia 681 e). Some forms of Roman marble oscilla, most notably the masks, as well as a few tondi bearing gorgon masks or relief busts of Jupiter Ammon, preserve the vestiges of just such an apotropaic function (Dwyer 1981:250-251). Satyr faces, in particular, perhaps more because of their grotesque features than for any semantic reason, were favored too (fig. 2).10 Voisin (1979:449) detaches oscilla from their etiological trappings altogether: "ce n'est pas pour comm?morer ou remplacer une pendaison que l'on suspend des oscilla [it is not to commemorate or substitute for a hanging that oscilla are suspended]." Instead, he argues, the ritual was strictly an appeasement of those spirits that had died unburied and hovered about in the phenomenal world. These restless shades were thought to congregate in ill-omened trees. Antiquarians writing in Roman antiquity record that trees of certain kinds, or in certain circumstances, were deemed either lucky or unlucky: arbor felix, arbor infelix. According to one ancient source, such designations were established by Tarquinius Priscus, one of the mythical early kings of Rome. Declaring that trees placed under the tutelage of the gods of the dead were of evil augury, he prescribed that they must be burned completely in order to deflect apparitions of the dead and morbid premonitions.11 Thus there is an express intention to turn away the spirits of those not properly buried by destroying the trees in which they congregate, or in some way counteracting their malice. Vergil brings the ancient belief splendidly to life at the gates of hell in the Aeneid, where "an elm spreads wide her ancient Figure 2. Oscillum in the form of a satyr mask discovered in 1995 in the House of Diana at Cosa, Italy. Photo: R. Taylor. boughs / opaque and huge; men say this is the home / of Foolish Dreams; they cling beneath each leaf."12 The dreams are unwanted visitations: shades of the restless dead, "lives unsubstanced, flitting empty shapes" (tenuis sine corpore vitas, 6.292) that addle Aeneas's mind, and that habitually flit about the countryside haunting its denizens.13 For Voisin, the act of hanging oscilla is thus a kind of exorcism.14 10. Pailler (1982:745-755) notes that nearly half of all known relief oscilla have a mask motif. Of these, two thirds are satyric; that is to say, they represent Dionysus, his wife Ariadne, satyrs, or similar beings. The others are comic or tragic. 11. ait enim Veranius De verbis pontifical ?bus: "felices arbores putantur esse quercus aesculus ilex suberies fagus corylus sorbus, ficus alba, pirus malus vitis prunus cornus lotus." Tarquitius autem Priscus in Ostentarlo arborario sic ait: "arbores quae inferum deorum avertentiumque in tutela sunt, eas infelices nominant: altern urn sanguinem filicem, ficum atrum, quaeque bacam nigram nigrosque fructus ferunt, itemque acrifolium, pirum silvaticum, pruscum rubum sentesque qui bus portenta prodigiaque mala comburi iubere oportet" (Macrobius, Saturnalia 3.20.2-3). 12. in medio ramos annosaque bracchia pandit/ulmus opaca, ingens, quam sedem Somnia vulgo / vana tenere ferunt, foliisque sub omnibus haerent, 6.282-284, Copley translation. 13.

Fragment of a Tarentine crater representing pinakes suspended from a tree. Raoul-Rochette 1836, plate VI. The oscillum as ex voto Astonishingly, very few scholarly treatments of oscilla regard them as votive objects. The tradition of hanging ex votos from trees is strong in the Greco-Roman tradition, and evidence for it can be found in many sources from Homer up through major Latin authors. The best argument for this approach, almost completely unheralded in the more recent literature, was made in 1836 by M. Raoul-Rochette in conjunction with his publication of fragments of a painted Tarentine crater (fig. 3: Raoul-Rochette 1836:403-412). Marshalling a formidable array of literary evidence, he demonstrated that Greco-Roman votive objects?many with a triumphal flavor?not only were hung in temples, sanctuaries, and sacred trees, but often took the form of little paintings or inscriptions.15 Ovid, among others, attests unambiguously to the votive nature of such objects in both the Metamorphoses and the Fasti. In a sacred grove of Ceres grew a massive oak in whose boughs were hung "diadems, tablets of remembrance, and festoons?tokens of those who had fulfilled their vows."16 And in the famous sanctuary of Diana at Nemi "threads hang thick as veils from the long hedgerows; many a tablet has been put there for the deserving goddess. Often will a woman, her brow wreathed, carry glowing torches [there] from the City to make good her vow."17 Suspended votive plaques appear on a number of Attic vases besides the one shown here.18 Imagery of 15.

Fresco detail from large peristyle of Villa San Marco at Stabiae. Photo: R. Taylor. precisely this kind is rare in the Roman repertoire, but not unknown. A small fresco vignette in the grand peristyle of the Villa San Marco at Stabiae, though somewhat weathered, still clearly represents several objects hung from a sacred tree including a diadem and a small pinax resembling the framed votive pictures often seen propped beside an altar in sacral-idyllic vignettes (fig. 4). The image on the pinax is illegible. However, a pair of hanging pinakes appear on a tomb fresco in Taranto, dating perhaps to the mid-second century or later; these, along with other sacral objects, are suspended from garlands (fig. 5: Tin? Bertocchi 1964:71-79). The documentary sketches reveal that the pinakes depicted figures in a conventional Dionysiac mode, in one case a satyr, in the other a maenad (?) crowned with ivy and carrying a thyrsus (fig. 6). The only thing that distinguishes these plaques from known Roman marble pinakes is that the latter favor a horizontal format. Trees Even today, in the west, the practice continues among neo-pagans and adherents of new-age religions. On a recent visit to the stone circle of Long Meg in Britain, for example, I saw many votives suspended from trees, ranging from clusters of flowers (fig. 7) to colored ribbons and a Tibetan prayer printed on cloth and ballasted with Chinese coins. The tradition of the Christmas tree itself once had a similar utility. If a certain tree is felix or infelix, then it is inherently powerful and implicitly apotropaic. If it carries votive objects as well, then those objects by extension acquire an amuletic property, either fair or foul. With this proposition in mind, let us examine a rather cryptic passage in the Natural History of Pliny the Elder. Pliny observes that the oldest recorded codification of Roman law seems to give special religious status to gardens. "For this reason a measure of sanctity attends them; only in a garden or a forum do we see satyric images again in a Delphic environment, appears on a bell crater in the British Museum; see Trendall and Webster 1971:3:3:47, 3:1:11. For a Scythian example see Minns 1913:312, fig. 223:3-4. Even the famous "foundry cup" in the Berlin Antikenmuseen (inv. F2294) clearly shows several such plaques suspended in the background along with masks or bronze heads, from what appears to be a pair of horns or a yoke. Being parts of a workshop shrine, they are not necessarily products of the foundry itself.

The Greek tradition of affixing satyric images in sanctuaries appears to date back to about 600 b.c.e. In addition to satyr-head antefixes found in archaic sanctuaries around the Greek and Etrusco-ltalian domains, we also have a fragment of Aeschylus's Isthmiastai recording a scene in which satyrs affix painted effigies of themselves to (or near) the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia?images which, the text makes clear, have ornamental, votive, and apotropaic functions.21 That such a practice should have been generalized to adorn other, quasi-sacral spaces comes as no surprise. Writing in the mid-first century ce., Pliny was catching the marble oscillum at the very peak of its popularity as a garden accessory. Most extant oscilla have been found in garden peristyles (Pailler 1982:771-772); in this respect, no other genre of Dionysiac imagery comports so satisfactorily with Pliny's comment. Few oscilla, however, have been found in fora or other public spaces.22 If we are to suggest: Because Pliny suggests that they were displayed here too, then 19. quam ob rem comitata est et religio quaedam, hortoque et foro tantum contra invidentium effascinationes dicari videmus in remedio saturica signa (Pliny, Historia natural is 19.50). 20. Near the ficus Ruminalis/ficus Navia in the Comitium in Rome was a statue of the satyr Marsyas which inspired copies in the fora of other colonies, including Raestum and Alba Fucens; see Servius, Commentarius ad Aeneida 3.20, 4.58; CIL 8.4219, 16417, 27771; LTURs.v.

But this statue, showing the short, pudgy satyr standing with buckling knees and a wineskin over his shoulder, has little of the apotropaic about it.

Scholars have long puzzled over the "votive wells" in the Comitium of the Roman Forum, shallow stone-lined shafts set in parallel rows in Republican phases of the pavement (fig. 8).23 These features were carried over to the fora of other towns in Roman Italy. In Rome their irregular shapes and imprecise but unmistakable alignment suggest that they were not wells at all, but apertures for trees. They seem to have been shaped in cross section to sheathe the trunks when the pavement was raised. From such trees private votives in the form of small wooden oscilla?saturica signa?may have been hung, along with other votive objects. The venerable trees themselves would have conferred some amuletic character upon the hangings; and when those in the pavement apertures died,24 their function lost along with their memory under later layers of pavement, the practice of adorning spaces like the Comitium with Archaic Comitium Republican Comitium EFGBo* fi??K?.

Even after the apertures in the Roman Forum disappeared, we know that some revered trees continued to exist there.25 The case for complexity In the realm of Roman sacral art, an agglomeration of auspicious functions reposed in a single object would be considered an advantage even if its power came at the expense of clarity of definition. The modern desire to isolate essential strands of causality?the insistence on the proposition "A is derived from B but not from C" all too often establishes a false dichotomy. The gradual commodification of sacral objects involved a complex amalgamation and dilution of meanings. Some were well understood, some half-remembered, others lost in the fog of history. But all were embedded, in some sense, in the artefact and may have had nothing to do with its intended function or meaning. They were complex syncretisms of disparate forms, functions, and contents, originating from many sources which through historical accident or the mere power of suggestion had been laminated to form a new signifying whole. A sophisticated viewer may have been capable of excavating or activating latent meanings, but rich polysemy was not an intended effect. Such laminations happened all the time. Thus decorative rosettes carved in relief often are indistinguishable from libation bowls because of the casual similarity in their forms. Likewise the rustic pedum, or shepherd's crook, and the short spiraled augur's staff, the lituus; they were occasionally merged in Roman theatrical imagery into a sort of crozier, without any discernible practical function.26 The traditional swags of fruit and greenery on Hellenistic funerary reliefs in time came to be populated with birds picking at the fruit, thereby generating a memento mor? motif: A trope of the festive ritual of the dead (the fruited festoon) comes to substitute for the dead themselves, plucked untimely from the vine. In turn, this motif was occasionally laminated upon the distinct Totenmahl theme. Now the bird moved to the hand of the deceased reclining at his funerary meal, picking at the fruit in his hand.27 That final, casual lamination blurred the original meanings of the iconographie traditions that came before, scrambling old codes and generating new ones. But the totality was pleasing, and freighted with the richness of received tradition. Similarly casual genealogies underlay the oscilla that dangled innocently in Roman domestic porticoes. So seemingly simple in form, iconography, and function, they hide a dense tangle of clashing contingencies as thick as the votives hanging like cobwebs on Diana's hedgerows.28 25. Richardson notes that on the relief known as the Plutei Traiani the figure of Marsyas stands beside the representation of a fig tree on a plinth, as if the tree itself were a statue. On trees in the Roman Forum see Dionysius of Halicarnassus 3.71.5; Festus 168-170 (Lindsay edition, 1913); Pliny, Historia naturalis 15.77-78; and the relevant entries in Richardson 1992 and LTUR. The stone-lined apertures occur in the very area that Coarelli identifies as the Volcanal, a small sanctuary of Vulcan which according to Pliny was the site of two venerable trees, a lotos supposedly planted by Romulus, and a cypress of equal size (HN: Historia Naturalis 16.236). Both of these trees survived into the Imperial period. Just to the south, a self-sown fig stood by the Lacus Curtius; it was accompanied by an olive and a grapevine planted for shade (Pliny, Historia naturalis 15.78, 19.23; Suetonius, Life of Caesar 39; Cassius Dio 43.24.2). We are not told whether this was a Ficus alba, which according to Tarquinius's list would be an arbor felix; or a Ficus ater, a tree of ill omen (evidently in early usage the tree's gender changes with its color). But in light of its position near the Lacus Curtius, a zone associated both with a lightning strike and with the disappearance underground of the hero Curtius?and thereby with a portal to the underworld?the latter would seem more likely. Indeed of at least four fig trees attested in the Forum area by Pliny, two are associated with dire events; the other is the so-called Ficus navia, which was sacra because it grew from a place struck by lightning. A third was removed because it had upset a statue of Silvanus (Pliny, Historia naturalis 15.77). 26. PPM Disegnatori 165, fig. 29, 349, fig. 161.

A fine example is in the Harvard University Art Museums, inv. 1977.216.1903. 28. As artificial a genre as Roman marble oscilla may seem, one must reject Pailler's contention that no ritual history underlies their existence (1982:791-812). Except for the mask, none of the four traditional forms of the oscillum has distinctly Dionysiac significance. Moreover, the tondo and the pinax bear too much resemblance, both in form and in context, to suspended objects represented in a variety of other artistic traditions, which I will discuss below. Dwyer (1981) and Loisy (1999:77) stand on much firmer ground when they propose that Roman oscilla are multivalent signifiers derived from an eclectic background. The tondo has no specific markers to identify it as the tympanum, the tambourine of the cult of Dionysus, though Pailler insists on an exclusive connection between the two. The rectangular shape, which Dwyer justifiably calls a pinax because of its resemblance to double-sided painted relief panels supported on small pillars in Pompeian gardens and their counterparts represented in wall frescoes, hardly evokes the cista mystica (a cylindrical ritual basket) in profile, as Pailler proposes; I have already demonstrated that painted rectangular votives suspended from cords were not unknown in Roman culture.</page><page sequence="11">Taylor: Roman oscilla 93 Seven possible sources for the oscillum A variety of traditions contributed to the oscillum as it emerged in the Roman west in the first century ce. Some have often been cited in this context, others have hardly been investigated at all. Let us then make a brief survey of some artistic or aesthetic traditions that have a claim to partake of the phenomenon of meaningful suspension. 1. The tradition of votive pinakes Greeks and Greek-influenced Italians hung little figurai pinakes from trees or shrubs as ex votos (Raoul Rochette 1836). Masks, too, may have been displayed in the same way, but the practice is hard to confirm.29 2. Suspended Dionysiac imagery The Greeks and Etruscans had a tradition of attaching theater masks and other Dionysiac imagery to the architraves of colonnaded structures. The pre-Roman evidence for this, though scant, appears in widely divergent sources that are rarely discussed together. In Athenaeus's noted description of the Dionysiac procession of Ptolemy II, the canopy protecting the cult statue was hung with "ivy, grapevine, and the other fruits"; attached to it were also "wreaths, fillets, thyrsi, tympana, diadems, and satyric, comic, and tragic masks/'30 The frontal attachment of a mask to the architrave over an intercolumniation is found both in south-Italian vase painting and on at least two engraved Etruscan mirrors (De Grummond 2002: fig. 2; Lohmann 1979: taf. 9.2; Gerhard, K?rte, and Kl?gmann 1843 1897:2:212, 5:101). On a volute crater in Lecce a woman and a dog are shown standing in a characteristic shrine; from its architrave hangs a drinking cup and a comic mask. The better-known of the Etruscan mirrors represents a scene of adornment of a bride in the foreground. Behind the action stands a colonnade. The head?or probably, the mask?of an old satyr wreathed in ivy appears to be propped on the architrave, its beard dangling down over the decorated fascia. In at least one Roman fresco a range of Dionysiac objects is deployed on a parade float similar to the one Athenaeus describes. A fresco in the Bottega del Profumiere in Pompeii (6.7.8) depicts members of the carpenters' guild carrying a litter in the form of a roofed shrine, which houses effigies of carpenters sawing and measuring wood and making a statue (PPM 4:1:390 391). The slender columns of the shrine are entwined with ivy and the pediment and architrave are hung with dozens of libation bowls, pitchers, drinking cups, garlands, thyrsi, and so on. 3. Suspended shields The habit of suspending shields in stoas, basilicas, temples, and other colonnaded structures is pervasive in Greco-Roman antiquity. Maurice Albert surely was right to recognize this strand in the origins of the oscillum. The connection between oscilla (round or peltate) and shields is everywhere in evidence, particularly in Roman frescoes. Some, like a fresco in room 14 in the Roman villa at Oplontis, display circular shields not appended to the wall behind the colonnade or attached to the columns themselves, but hanging from the soffit of the architrave, along with vegetal festoons, in exactly the same way as theater masks, tympana, and other objects displayed in many Roman frescoes.31 Understood as generic thank-offerings made by warriors, they are fundamentally votive. Their suspension above the 29. Specifically, depictions of heads or masks hanging from trees. Loisy (1999:10-12) collects visual evidence for this motif, though some is ambiguous or of questionable provenance. He cites, for example, a plaque in Trier that seems to depict a pair of heads in Phrygian caps hanging from the stem of a vine growing from a cantharus. As early as the 1720s, the engraved gem was published featuring a tree from which are hung four theater masks. See Montfaucon 1722:1:2:252, pi. 163; Rich 1884, s.v. "oscillum." I cannot verify the authenticity of this gem; it seems suspiciously like a visual etiology of Vergil's oscilla passage. 30.

The famous cubiculum from the Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, displays shields and masks in the same configuration, as do sacral-idyllic scenes depicting small roofed shrines (Ward Perkins and Claridge 1978:24, cat. 111; PPM Disegnatori 855; fig. 24). A large number of sacral-idyllic scenes feature a syzygium (a pair of columns or pillars crowned by a lintel) hung with disks and festoons. Monuments of this kind often have votive weapons (including shields) tied to their supports with ribbons. In the House of the Hunt at Pompeii (7.4.48), a megalographic fresco is centered upon a small round temple with shields hung prominently in its intercolumniations (PPM Disegnatori 242, fig. 6). The House of the Citharist (1.4.5, 25) preserves images both of a temple hung with shields and a military tent decorated in similar fashion (PPM 1.1.149-151, fig. 59; PPM Disegnatori 608-609, figs. 42, 43). Further examples could be cited ad nauseam. It should be obvious that every carved tondo hung in a Roman portico, whatever the subject matter of its relief, evokes the shield at least as much as the tympanum.</page><page sequence="12">94 RES 48 AUTUMN 2005 ground (alternatively, they are often shown tied to columns, but rarely on the ground) may reflect a need to sequester the relics of battle from the pollution of the dead underfoot, especially when offered to celestial gods. Indeed the trophy (tropaion) may have originated as a tree?perhaps a live sacred tree initially, replaced later by a hewn stump?on which were hung the weapons and armor of the defeated enemy. This ritual, too, may betray the lamination of functions, combining an offering to the gods with a frightening anthropomorphic amulet to keep the ghosts of the dead at bay. 4. Suspended skulls of sacrificial animals Bucrania, the ubiquitous wall- or column-mounted ox-skulls that often collaborate with festoons of greenery to articulate repeated architectural motifs in sacral art, may have contributed obliquely to the oscillum tradition. Servius Auctus would appear to lend some credence to this derivation: "They are called oscilla either because heads and faces of sacrificial victims [i.e., animals] were affixed at the tops of poles [i.e., the os- in oscilla is derived from osf "bone"], or because the Oscans reportedly often practiced this game and spread it throughout Italy" (Commentarius ad Ge?rgica 2.389). 5. Suspended objects of personal adornment: Etruscan evidence Etruscan art suggests a practice of hanging objects of personal adornment from trees. A fresco in the late sixth-century-B.c.E. Tomba del la Caccia e Pesca at Tarquinia depicts two men dancing ecstatically around a stylized tree from which hang garlands, a toilette box, and a mirror (De Grummond 1982:170 and fig. 110), while a roughly contemporary incised mirror from the Tomba del Triclinio at Tarquinia, representing a kind of outdoor boudoir scene with a pair of lovers, shows the same kinds of objects suspended from a rinceau of intertwined oak and vine (fig. 9). The object to the woman's right is a box mirror (Klappspiegel) of a form that characteristically includes a loop for hanging (Schwarzmaier 1997; Z?chner 1942). One is reminded of Xerxes's worshipful adornment of a plane tree with similar objects (Herodotus 7.31; Aelian, Varia historia 2.14). 6. Suspended objects of personal adornment: South Italian evidence Similar objects suspended from a funerary shrine or canopy appear in south-Italian art. On Apulian vases in Figure 9. Archaic Etruscan mirror from the Tomba del Triclinio at Tarquinia. Gerhard, K?rte, and Kl?gmann 1843-1897:4:421. particular, the oft-appearing aedicular shrines (na?skoi) enclosing figures of the deceased are habitually decorated with a range of objects suspended from the ceiling, such as mirrors, diadems, garlands, balls, baskets, toilette boxes, and armor. So widespread is the topos that it constitutes one of the fundamental vocabularies underlying the difficult iconography of the genre (Loisy 1999:17, 76-77); yet rarely does it receive more than passing attention in discussions of Roman oscilla. Less common but certainly helpful in defining the essentially funerary character of this imagery are the fifth- and fourth-century-B.c.E. painted sarcophagi of Poseidonia (Paestum), which reveal a similar fascination with suspended articles. The most telling scene appears on the western gabled slab of Andriuolo Tomb 47, housing a female burial. One end-slab bears the well known image of the woman stepping into a boat ferried by a winged, gorgon-headed spirit. On the other (fig. 10), the deceased woman is shown lying in state under a canopy supported by four slender columns. From its ceiling hang two circular mirrors with handles, a wreath or diadem, and a rectangular toilette box?exactly the sorts of items suspended from the na?skoi shown on</page><page sequence="13">Taylor: Roman oscilla 95 Figure 10. End-slab of Tomb 47 from Andriuolo near Raestum. Paestum, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, inv. 21509. Apulian vases or hanging from trees or vines on the Etruscan mirrors. Following Stephen Wilk's recent argument for the original architectural function of gorgon masks (Wilk 2000), it could be said that such objects had a purely apotropaic function. If the deceased lay in state under such canopies, the dangling articles, flashing and perhaps clattering in the wind, served to repel scavenging birds. By analogy, the obtrusive objects could have been thought to repel malicious spirits from this symbolic house of the dead, just as the little phallic wind chimes (tintinnabula) displayed near Roman thresholds protected the space of the living. But this explanation cannot be complete; why then were certain objects, most without any apparent apotropaic qualities, chosen, and not gorgon masks or the like, which would seem naturally suited to such a task? It would seem that in south-Italian usage meaningful suspension is m?tonymie rather than metaphoric; it relies not on the noun, conjuring up what is absent through resemblance or substitution, but evokes instead the verb, recalling the virtuous life of the deceased agent carried out with the help of these quotidian things. But its function extends beyond the realm of signification. Perhaps it is best to interpret these suspended objects as a means of holding at bay the spirit of the temporarily unburied corpse. As long as its corporeal host lies above ground, the spirit is free to wander and haunt; but it is calmed by the objects of domesticity that hover before it, just as it will be comforted by them in the grave. 7. Mystic Dionysiac disks Some Dionysiac scenes represent plain disks, hung from cords, with which human or divine figures seem to interact. These appear exclusively in Roman contexts, and thus merit special attention. Drawing attention to oscillum-like objects on reliefs representing scenes of Dionysiac initiation mysteries, Railler (1982:798-805) contends that they are fictive: they sprang up more or less autonomously and served as the models, rather than iconographie derivations, of Roman marble oscilla. Yet he does not claim that the activities being depicted are fictions. Why then should we presume that the material staging for these scenes is a fantasy concocted in some artist's workshop? In fact there are numerous instances in which the very same kinds of disks appearing in these scenes are co?pted from the background and become part of the activity itself. A stucco relief in the Stabian Baths at Pompeii, now destroyed, depicted an old satyr in a chlamys, his open left hand extended and his right gripping a thyrsus (fig. 11 : Rostovtzeff 1927:75, fig. 2).32 32. A drawing by La Volpe from 1857 appears in PPM 6.174; PPM Disegnatori 660, fig. 106.</page><page sequence="14">96 RES 48 AUTUMN 2005 Figure 11. Detail of the stucco decoration from the peristyle fa?ade of the Stabian Baths at Pompeii, now lost. Rostovtzeff 1927:75, fig. 2. He stares intently at a disk hanging directly in front of his nose. To the right are the remains of the tree from which it hangs. A marble relief from the Villa lovis on Capri, now in the Naples Museum, depicts a plain round disk and a pedum (shepherd's crook) partly obscured by it hanging prominently from a tree branch in front of an altar and a herm of Priapus; a silen riding an ithyphallic donkey approaches the ensemble (fig. 12). Even more interesting is a silver libation bowl from Thil (Haute-Garonne), now in the British Museum (figs. 13, 14: Feug?re and Martin 1988:67-69, no. 5; Walters 1921:283, cat. 132). The rim of this vessel preserves a remarkable frieze of Dionysiac vignettes alternating between loosely heraldic pairs of amorini and quadrupeds. These are separated by a traditional ensemble of mask, altar, and thyrsus. Two of the three amorino vignettes merit special attention. In each case it appears that one boy is winged, the other not; each is loosely draped with a swag of fabric. In one thematic cluster, the figure on the left dangles a disk from a cord in front of a central altar heaped with incense while the figure on the right plays the double flute (fig. 13). A second vignette displays two amorini in similar poses; but this time, a goat's head adorns the altar and the right-hand cherub purposefully extends with both arms a slightly larger disk pendent to the one dangling from his partner's hand (fig. 14). The figure on the left turns his gaze away. If these disks were merely the ubiquitous Dionysiac tambourines (tympana), and nothing more, then their treatment here could only be regarded as bizarre. In both cases the left-hand amorino holds an elongated object low to the ground; it has been taken to be a torch or flute, but one authority has suggested that it is a stick with which the tympanum is being beaten (TOGR 1989:241-243). This cannot be right; tympana of ecstatic cults are always shown being struck by the bare hand. None of these disks is being struck, and two of them are being suspended from cords. All three are proffered in a ritualistic manner. The bough of immortality In both scenes the "stick" on the left could be interpreted as a branch being detached from the nearby tree. In one case the trunk of the tree may even reveal the stump of its detached member. It is possible, then, that the amorino is preparing to offer not only the disk, but also the bough from which it hung. The magical significance of the sacred bough in a wide range of ancient mystery cults is well known (Seyrig 1944, 1927:202-210; Robert 1915). Drawn particularly from evergreen plants (laurel, pine, ivy, pomegranate, ?lex, etc.), which represented immortality, sprigs of greenery were used as offerings or even apotropaic talismans in initiatory rites involving a ritual death and rebirth. Servius interprets the most famous literary example, the golden bough offered by Aeneas to Proserpina as payment for his traversal of the underworld, as a ritual akin to that of the Greek cult of Demeter and Kore, in which the mysteries, which involved a ritual journey through the underworld, were achieved only when a bough was offered to Kore (Servius, Commentarius ad Aeneida 6.136; Seyrig 1927:204-205). (Some cults of Dionysus, particularly those in which he was assimilated to a god of the underworld, seem to have embraced this</page><page sequence="15">Taylor: Roman oscilla 97 Figure 12. Marble relief from the Villa lovis on Capri. Naples, Museo Nazionale, inv. 27712. tradition).33 The trees represented on the platter may represent some kind of conifer. Vergil specifies that Dionysiac oscilla were hung from the boughs of a pine tree, and Firmicus Maternus famously relates a ritual of the Cybele cult in which "each year a pine tree is felled and a simulacrum of a youth [Attis] is appended [subligatur] in the middle of the tree" (De errore 27.1 ). It is also interesting that the type of oscillum in Vergil's passage was made of cork (cortex)?the bark of the quercus suber, an evergreen oak. Perhaps, then, we see a double dedication: two oscilla, their power to confer a kind of immortality augmented by the evergreen branch on which they were ritually suspended. In all likelihood, however, a majority of Roman viewers simply saw these "sticks" as torches? themselves perhaps derived from a pitchy evergreen such as a pine. We have already learned from Ovid that tablets (i.e., pinakes) suspended from strings and torches were common votive gifts to Diana Nemorensis, and indeed torches are often seen among votive objects in the pictorial record. A convincing visual parallel is to be found in an intarsia panel from Pompeii, now in the Naples Museum (fig. 15: Ward Perkins and Claridge 1978, 66:174; cat. 156). At the center is a syzygium, a simple gatelike post-and-lintel structure common in sacral-idyllic scenes. On the right, a satyr draped in an animal skin and wielding a thyrsus dances entranced, while an equally ecstatic maenad on the left approaches the center. Dangling from her extended left hand is a suspended disk that looks just like those on the bowl from Thil; in her right, she carries a flaming torch. The disk is commonly presumed to be a tympanum; and indeed there are many examples in Roman art of tympana hung from loops, their identities established by the painted decorations on their faces or by peripheral jingles or tassels, as on a tambourine.34 If this is a 33. According to Pausanias (1.31.6) the Acharnians called Dionysus Kissos (ivy) and a scholiast of Aristophanes {Equit?s 408) asserts that "even the boughs that the mystai carry" were called Bakchoi; cf. the dictionary entries for "?otKxoc" in Suidas and Hesychius. 34. See, for example, PPM Disegnatori 647, fig. 90. This stucco relief shows a maenad holding a virtually identical disk, but decorated</page><page sequence="16">98 RES 48 AUTUMN 2005 Figure 13. Silver patera from Thil (Haute-Garonne, France). Detail of figurai frieze on the rim. London, British Museum, inv. GR. 1824.4-89.70. tympanum, it lacks those usual markers.35 Nor is there a free hand with which to strike it; indeed, to our uncomprehending eyes, it has no perceptible agency in the maenad's ecstasy. Instead, it is an incomplete or incipient signifier; for if we are reading the maenad's gesture correctly, it is evidently destined to be the central (votive?) ornament of the syzygium. But what is it? The mirror angle One feels powerless to identify the meaning or function of these disks themselves. They are as ambiguous as the round objects supported on pedestals that are represented in a vast array of cultic contexts.36 Nevertheless, let us entertain the possibility that they were understood, at least in part, as mirrors. They do not take the traditional forms of the handled Roman case mirror or hinged Klappspiegel, but their deficiency in formal definition is not entirely insurmountable. The most definitive visual representation of a disklike Dionysiac mirror is on a silver wine cup from the Berthouville treasure, now in the Biblioth?que Nationale in Paris (fig. 16: Balensiefen 1990:66-71; Van de Grift with a standing robed human figure. Cf. a small mosaic from Pompeii in Ward Perkins and Claridge 1978:159, cat. 108. Its ?mage is misinterpreted as a crab or spider; but in fact it is a tympanum with a hanging loop and looped thongs around its periphery. An especially interesting example appears on a late-antique mosaic in Pedrosa, Spain (Kiilerich 2001, again misinterpreted). Here the hanging tympana take the same form with looped thongs and are arranged around the central panel, carrying portrait busts on their surfaces. For tympana suspended from the finger of a satyr or maenad see PPM Disegnatori 500-503, figs. 12, 15, 16, 675, fig. 125, 706, fig. 166. Fine examples of Roman tombs depicting hanging Dionysiac instruments have been discovered in Taranto (Tin? Bertocchi 1964: 61-77). 35. A similarly equipped maenad, this time depicted alone on a ground of black, now at the Museo Nazionale in Naples (inv. 9298) is from the House of the Ship (6.10.11) in Pompeii. She carries a thyrsus in her left hand and dangles a flat disk from a short cord in her left. 36. Some are circular, some oviform; some stand freely, others are bound in a ribbon or garland. A plain oviform disk on a pedestal appears on an Etruscan mirror {ES 2.171). A silver stater o? Poseidonia with dedicatory legend to Poseidon shows on its reverse a bull behind which appears the disk on pedestal {SNG 2, Poseidonia no. 683, 684, pi. 19; ACGC 198, no. 658). In Dionysiac contexts: Pailler (1988: figs. 3-4) illustrates a terra sigillata bowl at Vienne which shows disks propped on pillars in positions between scenes of initiation (oscillum like objects are also shown suspended against the plain background); a Dionysiac sarcophagus in the Museo Nazionale di Roma shows a robed, bearded figure resting a tympanum-Uke disk on a low pillar (Koch and Sichtermann 1982: fig. 230). In Isiac contexts: Ven it 2001:140-141, pi. 23. The motif appears occasionally in stucco, as in the border panel surrounding the Achilles and Priam scene in the Tomb of the Rancratii on the Via Latina (Delia Portella 2002: 74-75). Along the transverse pool sometimes called the "Nile" at the House of Octavius Quartio (2.2.2) at Pompeii, the columns were decorated with this imagery; see PPM 3.99-100, fig. 86. The editors, interestingly, describe the decoration as "colonne corinzie sormontate da oscilla." The form even appears on the pulpitum of the theater at Sabratha, inscribed (so it is thought) like a sundial.</page><page sequence="17">Taylor: Roman oscilla 99 Figure 14. Detail of the frieze on the London patera. 1984; Babelon 1916:88-91, 93, no. 6). This represents, among a dense array of cultic images, a centauress bearing in both her hands a circular disk which enframes a contracted mirror image, in relief, of a number of the figures and objects directly in front of her. Like the amorino on the right of figure 14, she holds the disk by its edge; like that on the left, she turns her gaze sharply away. Though rare in Dionysiac imagery, the mirror in various forms is embedded in both visual and literary sources referring to the cult, and its presence has attracted the interest of art historians and theorists of religion alike (Frontisi-Ducroux and Vernant 1997; Gallistl 1995; J?nsson 1995; Balensiefen 1990; Simon 1962; Cumont 1917). Like the ritual bough, it can be associated with transformation and rebirth; moreover, "les miroirs, qui refl?tent comme par miracle la figure des personnes pr?sentes, ?taient cens?s pouvoir faire appara?tre aussi celle des absents" [mirrors which reflect as if by a miracle the figures of persons present were believed also to be able to make the absent appear] (Cumont 1917:104). The current thinking is that the mirror may have served as a ritual tool of personal transformation, the enactment of death and rebirth or the migration of the self that so often attends religious ekstasis. The mirror, which according to the Orphic tradition was one of the objects given to the baby Zagreus as he was murdered and transformed into the immortal Dionysus, may have evolved into an implement of ritual. Jean-Pierre Vernant (1990:135) sees the mirror as a tool, used in conjunction with the mask, by which the initiand and the god can make the chiastic leap of being: i^fHHB^&amp;SB9?^S^. ^^^^^^HBSHaBBRMHbbbbmmiaSBBSIEIa?JS^BSHSSHB?

Dans le miroir o? Dionysos enfant se regarde, le dieu se disperse et divise. Dans le miroir initiatique, notre reflet se profile comme une figure ?trange, un masque qui, en face de nous, ? notre place, nous regarde. [The initiate looking in the mirror must see himself in a Dionysiac mask, transformed into the god that possesses him, displaced from the place where he is to a different place, transmuted into an Other who returns him to unity. In the mirror where the baby Dionysus observes himself, the god is dispersed and divided. In the mirror of initiation, our reflection is contoured like an alien figure, a mask which, facing us, takes our place, gazing at us.] Following Vernant, H?l?ne Cassimatis (1998) sees a somewhat similar function for mirrors in south-Italian vase painting. The almost fetishistic attention paid to inanimate objects in this corpus, which distinguishes it so acutely from vase painting of the Greek mainland, is directed with special energy to mirrors, both suspended and handheld. Cassimatis draws a divide, similar to that delimiting the dual ontology of Dionysiac cult, between the realm of the living, outside the naiskos, and the realm of the dead inside it. But here, rather than function as a machine of personal transformation, the mirror serves to bring the living into communication with the dead through the agency of the gaze. "En tout cas ce que ces repr?sentations tentent de montrer c'est la vision simultan?e de deux mondes, s?par?s dans la realit? et fondamentalement ?trangers l'un a l'autre, mais que les croyances et l'imagination font se rencontrer" [in every case what these representations try to show is the simultaneous vision of two worlds, separated in reality and each fundamentally alien from the other, but which are made to meet in belief and imagination] (Cassimatis 1998:323-325). Boudoir objects in general?and mirrors in particular?may have been thought to remind spirits of their bodily past, allowing them to reconstitute themselves in the presence of the living. According to this understanding, the mirrors are in no sense apotropaic; quite the opposite. Far from deflecting spirits, they draw them</page><page sequence="19">Taylor: Roman oscilla 101 forth, or they draw the living into the realm of the dead. They are, in essence, miniature portals of communication. And that brings us back to the syzygium on the Pompeian panel (fig. 15). This architectural form?a simple lintel on a pair of columns or pillars, often with cinerary urns arranged across the top?evokes the cult sites of heroes, and thus the living memory of the dead. It is liminality embodied. As in a funerary epigram, the deceased speaks through this portal to the living from beyond the grave. Perhaps with its dangling, flashing disk(s) it also invites the visitor to break on through to the other side. Is this, like the objects impending over the bier in Poseidonia, or those hung from the na?skoi of the reanimated dead on south-Italian vases, the symbolic remnant of a mystery cult practice? And is it any accident that so many syzygia and honorific columns in sacral-idyllic scenes are accompanied by a gnarled tree, as if the older cultic relic were slowly yielding its cargo of souls and symbols?and meanings?to the new? Here we may gain some insight into the presence of architecture in the tableau of meaningful suspension. The garden/forum just beyond the colonnade represents the more ancient context, in which the enabling tree adds magical power to the dangling artifact through metonymy; signification of eternal life through metaphor; and contextual meaning by detaching it from the chthonic realm and offering it to the air. The enframing colonnade, on the other hand, generates a new binary function (in/out) to complement the up/down dichotomy of elevation and the moving/still polarity of suspension. It strengthens the apotropaic dimension by realizing an interior sphere to be protected; but in doing so, it also admits of permeability. In denying entry to some, it must allow it to others. Let us return momentarily to the various ancient etymologies and etiologies of the oscillum, which are saturated with intimations of the dead (Mazzacane 1980; Voisin 1979). The most interesting of these may be the explanation proposed by Macrobius, an author of late antiquity. He relates that men of old placated Dis, a god of the underworld, with human heads and Saturn with human victims because of a Greek oracle that commanded, "Send heads to Hades and men [phota] to the Father." But Hercules introduced an innovation that reinterpreted the oracle more moderately; the sacrificants thereafter "offered to Dis not the heads of men but oscilla devised by skill in human form, and honored the Saturnian altars not with the sacrifice of a man but with kindled lights?for phota means not only a man but also a light" (Saturnalia 1.7.31).37 Elsewhere (1.11.48) Macrobius adds that oscilla were offered at shrines (sacella) of Dis, thereby merging into one ritual the images of small trabeated shrines, swinging effigies, and torches. The cleverly duplicitous oracle is fictitious, of course; but it may have been fashioned to make sense of a vaguely remembered ritual involving torches, oscilla, and shrines of the dead. Clearly a syzygium may represent a threshold between contrasting modes of consciousness or existence. But how might a mirror, or any other suspended artifact, assist the psychic journey into the au del?? Signification alone cannot summon a trance. One wonders if these are vestiges of a cult practice of hypnotism, helped along by mind-altering substances and music. After all, the most salient dynamic characteristic of the oscillum is oscillation. Perhaps the lexicographic derivations of ancient commentators are not entirely arbitrary when they focus on the motion of the oscillum; Servius derives the term from a conjunction of the synecdochic Latin word for "face" (os) and the obscure verb eitlere, "to move" (Commentarius ad Ge?rgica 2.389). A flickering torch in the dark, iterated in the swinging bronze medium but otherwise sequestered from the initiand's sight, would augment the mesmerizing effect of the disk alone. Lest we think that mirrors were never used in such elaborate and inscrutable ways, let us consider a ritual that was practiced in Pausanias's time at the Temple of Demeter at Patras: Here there is an infallible oracle?not infallible in all matters, but in the case of the ailing. Tying a mirror to a fine cord, they lower it, taking care that it does not sink too far into the spring, but extends just far enough to touch the water with its circumference. Then, praying to the goddess and burning incense, they look into the mirror: this shows them the patient either alive or dead.38 I do not wish to suggest that this ritual is related to the one I am proposing. It is an example of catoptromancy, the practice of reading mirrors to predict the future, in Roman sources (Macchioro 1930; Delatte 1932). Here 37. The connection between Dis Rater and Liber / Bacchus / Dionysus is quite close, according to Bayet (1971:89-129, 241-270). 38. uocvteIov ?? ?vtocu0&lt;x ?oriv dc^eu???, o? uev ?xri TravT? ye TTpayucm, ?XX?

But it may have assisted concurrently in the act of evoking the trance.39 One notes that reflection is not the only dynamic in this ritual; there is also movement. The mirror is lowered (oscillating?) to the surface of the spring. Oscillation and divination In light of the divinatory function of the mirror at Ratras, I would suggest yet another possible source of ancient meaning for the oscillum. If suspended objects mark a threshold of transition, then they may have a mantic function to assist the would-be traveler in negotiating the menacing divide. The seemingly arbitrary nature of oscillation introduces just the kind of contingency that is necessary in a mechanism of divination. In his novel Middlesex, Jeffrey Eugenides (2002:4-5) relates the story of an old Greek matriarch who predicted the gender of unborn children by dangling a spoon from a string over the pregnant mother's womb. East-west oscillation promised a girl; north-south, a boy. The spoon was kept in a silkworm box along with amenities of the boudoir such as hair braids and wedding crowns. On the box was the image of a mulberry tree from which the silkworm would naturally have hung. The attentive reader comes to realize that the spoon stands in for the silkworm itself, with its own rich metaphorical possibilities. In our own body of evidence, one is struck by the scrutiny with which the old satyr stares at the hanging disk in figure 11. Is the disk hypnotic? Or does it have something to tell, like the old woman's spoon? Or both? Conclusion Every oscillum form probably has its own functional origins. Even a single form may harbor paradoxical complexities, revealing the vestiges of apparently contradictory functions. Objects suspended from trees, hedges, or garlands may have had votive or even apotropaic purposes. Those dangling from the catafalques of the dead may have originated from the premise that ordinary objects associated with the deceased's activities in life could shepherd the released spirit into contented repose, or even bring it into communication with the living. Contradiction is often the stuff of reality. Why shouldn't such paradoxes exist in the object, either as art or as artifact, as content or context? Paradox reflects human ambiguity toward the spirit world itself: in some ways we welcome it, in others we appease it, in others still we shun it. The sacrum is by definition both blessed and accursed, venerable and execrable. Obviously this article has served less to unravel the mysteries of oscilla than to implicate them in a web of fragmentary meanings. But I believe it takes a legitimate approach to sacral objects that have long histories in the marketplace of ideas. Oscilla are delightful, mottled mongrels with a diverse heritage of forms and functions. Any attempt to reduce them to a single, coherent historical phenomenon is destined to fail. Like the wildly diverse architectural forms of Roman tombs, for example, their evident unity of function at the moment of their commodification is no argument for a uniform heritage. 39. Lest we become too dogmatic in interpreting the ancient mirror as a ritual tool of self-realization, Plutarch presents a radically different point of view, which brings us back to the seemingly limitless range of apotropaic devices in antiquity: "Self-bewitchment is most frequently brought about by the streams of particles reflected from sheets of water or other mirror-like surfaces; these reflections rise like vapour and return to the beholder, so that he is himself injured by the same means by which he has been injuring others" (Moralia 682e-f, Loeb translation).
