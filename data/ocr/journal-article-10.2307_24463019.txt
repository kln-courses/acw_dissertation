<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book III of Paradise Lost: Milton's Satisfaction Theory of the Redemption William J. Rewak, S.J. Eclectic theologian that he was, it is not sur prising that Milton's theory of the Redemption has its sources in Augustine, Anselm, Calvin, and many other theologians and preachers of lesser note. The Bible remained his prime source, though it seems his interpretation of the Redemption as drawn from the Scriptures was always colored by his theolog ical reading. It will be the purpose of this essay to indicate the particular nuance of the "satisfaction" theory of the Redemption that Milton used in Book III of Paradise Lost and to indicate further his sources, some of which are known, some of which can only be conjectured. There is a slight disadvantage involved in such an investigation because, as Hanford and Taaffe have said, "Milton makes little of the sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin. He accepts it as a necessary condition of man's salvation but not as taking the place of man's individual choice of good. Neither personally nor as a part of his system did the idea greatly move or interest him."1 Nor has it moved or greatly interested his commentators. Maurice Kelley, probably the best of Milton's theo logical commentators, found it sufficient in one case simply to parallel appropriate quotations from the Christian Doctrine and from Book III where Milton speaks most fully of the Redemption,2 and in the other case to analyze the famous lines 173-202 of Book III which deal with the problem of the relation between free will and predestination.3 It MILTON QUARTERLY 97 was Kelley's conclusion, in this latter case, that Milton opts for free will and is therefore anti-Cal vinistic. Our conclusion will show that, when he writes of Christ's Redemption, the influence of Cal vin remains strong—though, admittedly, Calvin's is only one voice among many. There were in Milton's time—and there remain to this day—two mainstreams of biblical exegesis concerning itself with Christ's satisfaction for the "original sin" of Adam and the personal sins of all men. The two approaches began with the Fathers of the Church when they were attempting to for mulate a doctrinal thesis built on the biblical ma terial; the doctrinal development reached its high point in the medieval syntheses of Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, and, for the Reforming Churches of the Renaissance, in Luther and Calvin. Since these men crystallize in their work the conclusions of the dog matic argumentation of the preceding centuries,, it will be sufficient to quote from them alone, giving added references where needed. Once the two positions are marked off, it will be clear to which one Milton attaches himself. Some of the biblical texts in question are: "... it was guilt of ours crushed him down .... It is for my people's sake I have smitten him" (Is. 53:5,8); "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Ps. 21; Mt. 27:46); "God has offered him Qesus Christ] to us as a means of reconciliation, in virtue of faith, reconciling us with his blood""(Rom. 3:25);</page><page sequence="2">98 MILTON QUARTERLY "There was something the law could not do—and this God has done, by sending us his own Son, in the fashion of our guilty nature . . . (Rom. 8:13); "Christ never knew sin, and God made him into sin for us, so that in him we might be turned into the holiness of God" (2 Cor. 5:21); "from this curse invoked by the law Christ has ransomed us, by himself becoming, for our sakes, an accursed thing . . . ." (Gal. 3:13); "He did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us" (Rom. 8:32). The general method of most of the Fathers, and of Thomas Aquinas in particular, is to set these quotations in the context of the whole of biblical theology and to work from what they consider the essential message of the Redemption: that it was out of love we were redeemed, both the love of the Father and of the Son. They kept in mind the thought of St. John: "This my Father loves in me, that I am laying down my life to take it up again afterwards ... that is the charge which my Father has given me" Oohn 10:17-18). Both St. John Chrysostom and Aquinas observe here that Jesus wished to emphasize the voluntary nature of his passion and to remove any suspicion that he was opposed to his Father's will.4 Thus the Son, through his love and obedience, concurred with the Father in becoming man and "satisfying" for the sins of man. But it is important to this early and dominant strain of dogmatic de velopment that though Christ suffered for our sins he himself was not morally guilty; as a person, he was innocent. "Christ suffered a penalty in satis faction for our sins and not for any of his own."5 "Christ suffered for us what we had deserved to suffer ourselves as a consequence of the sin of our first parents, and first of all death, which crowns all human sufferings .... Thus Christ wished to suffer death for our sakes so as to be able to free us from spiritual death: this he did by accepting, in spite of his innocence, the punishment due to us."6 Thomas states clearly: "The sinner alone may be punished for his sin when it is a question of inflicting punishment precisely as such," for then it is a question of justice, but "when a penalty is freely undergone to make satisfaction one may take the place of another."7 Such a man is freely performing an act of charity. An analogy may be drawn in the case of a man who pays a fine incurred by someone who has broken the law; the law cannot compel him to do this, but he would be respecting the law's justice, and his motivation is love. That he agrees to accept the fine does not make him guilty of the offense. To put it a different way: the sufferings Christ underwent furnished the material element of the satisfaction, they were not punishment for his personal sin; his love for sinful man was the principle which makes the suffering efficacious. It was his love, not his sin, that caused his suffering. Granted that Christ was not himself a sinner, he could not literally be "punished," for "It is es sential to punishment to be against the will of him who suffers it."8 Once the punishment is accepted in an attitude of love, it becomes satisfaction. Thus the fundamental principle for Aquinas, as for Anselm, is that it is not punishment but love which makes satisfaction what essentially it is. Since Christ was not a sinner and was not there fore punished, what about his death? "His death was not due to sin."9 "Christ had not merited death since he was sinless."10 "Christ, since he was not subject to sin, was liable neither to death nor cor ruption, but accepted death voluntarily for our salvation."11 "Christ accepted death of his own free will in order to make satisfaction for us and not as though bound by the penalty for original sin, for he was not liable to death."12 "It was fitting for Christ to descend into hell, not because he was liable to punishment, but in order to free those who were there."13 Strictly speaking, the efficient cause of Christ's death was not sin at all: neither his, for he had none, nor ours, but his love for the Father and for us on the occasion of our sins.14 Christ did not suffer, then, the death that was owning to us for Adam's sin, for that death was eternal—complete separation from God. His death, which he accepted as the natural result of becoming man, was a salvific death; not only was it the occasion of his act of satisfaction, but it was through it that he changed the character of human death. Justice is certainly involved, but it is neither commutative justice nor vindictive justice; rather it is retributive justice, which Aquinas includes within the concept of the virtue of religion: inasmuch as God is our sovereign Creator, we owe him honor and obedience.15 It is under this rubric of religion that Milton describes Adam and Eve honoring God both before going to their bower at night and upon waking in the morning.16 But this attitude of prayer ful allegiance Adam did not retain; he was dis obedient. Thus it was necessary, not for God's personal honor, but for his honor as it exists among us and also for our own salvation, that Adam's disobedience find its counterpart in Christ's obedience.</page><page sequence="3">MILTON QUARTERLY 99 Since there was no vindictive justice, it would be wrong to attribute "wrath" to the Father in his wish that the Son offer him an act of love and obedience. Wrath could only be attributed to God metaphorically, anyway. Properly and analogically speaking, we speak of God's anger when we wish to vindicate his decision to impose just punishment for sin actually committed and adhered to.17 Thus God's "wrath" is really operative only in hell though we are still speaking in anthropomorphic terms, for in the Christian context, a man chooses separation from God of his own free will; the man's choice is not God's fault, even though words like "anger" and "wrath" are used, and misused. The idea that Christ "redeemed" man through his death led some authors—Irenaeus, Origen—to the conclusion that he paid his ransom of blood to the devil.18 Even Augustine had said: "The suf ferings of Christ were a ransom by accepting which the devil was not enriched but bound."19 Aquinas, however, states: "It was justice in relation to God and not to the devil, which required that man be redeemed."20 "Since redemption was necessary for man's deliverance only as regards God, and not as regards the devil, the price was payable not to the devil but to God. And thus Christ is said to have offered his blood, which was the price of our re demption, to God and not to the devil."21 Indeed, the biblical notion of a ransom is a metaphor and cannot be carried too far; ordinarily it means simply that God has purchased (redimere) his people for his own, without paying any price to anyone (Deut. 7:6). Aquinas was not the first to attack this aber ration; Anselm, in doing so before him, 22 had elaborated the first really serious theory of the atonement. Anselm can serve as a transition to the doctrine of the Reformers, for while he stood in the Catholic tradition his doctrine influenced not only the Re formers but Milton himself. He tried to dispel, in the Cur Deus Homo, the idea that God needed to purchase from another autonomous and powerful subject the souls which he had created; but in the process Anselm set up another opposition between the mercy and the justice of God. A. C. Welch remarks: . . the weakness of the whole position is the legality through which it construes all God's dealings with men."23 This may be the key-note of the second main stream of dogmatic development: it applied too rigorously and literally, perhaps, the legal terminology and metaphors of the Scriptural texts in question. Thus the thesis that Christ was substituted for sinners to incur the penalties which were owing in retributive justice for their sins is taught by Luther in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians. "Christ voluntarily took all our sins upon himself as though he himself had committed them: having become a sinner, the curse itself, it was just that he should suffer the penalty of death to achieve our salvation as though it were the effect of a divine condemnation."24 "He himself, certainly, is innocent because he is the immaculate, the unspotted Lamb of God, but, because he bears the sins of the world, his innocence is loaded with the guilt of all these sins. Whatever sins you or I or all of us have com mitted and shall commit, they are as much Christ's [propria Christi] as though he had committed them himself. In short, we shall perish for eternity if our sin does not become the very sin of Christ."25 According to the language of both Luther and Calvin, Christ is actually a sinner: ". . . our sins and our death are abolished in the sin and death of Christ."26 "And this, no doubt, all the prophets did foresee in spirit, that Christ should become the greatest transgressor, murderer, adulterer, thief, reb el, blasphemer, etc., that ever was or would be in the world."27 Since they seem to have held that Christ was truly a sinner upon the cross, the Reformers visited upon him what seems to be the vindictive justice of the Father: "Here now cometh the law and saith: I find him a sinner and that such a one as hath taken upon him the sins of all men, and I see no sins else but in him; therefore let him die upon the cross. And so he setteth upon him and killeth him."28 The language here is noteworthy, for it introduces the element of the "wrath" of the Father. "Our absolution consists," Calvin writes, "in this, that the obligation to be punished has been shifted to the Son of God. This compensation is to be kept in mind above all else if we are not to tremble with fear and anxiety throughout our lives, as if we were still threatened by that just vengeance of God which the Son of God took upon himself."29 The voluntary satisfaction of the earlier theology has been changed to an "obliga tion to be punished." Further, "If Christ had died a bodily death only, this would have contributed nothing to our redemption; on the other hand, it was especially valuable that he should feel simul taneously the severity of the divine vengeance. .. ,"30 Calvin insists that Christ had to experience the full punishment of eternal death; it is a logical con sequence, after all, of the doctrine that Christ was</page><page sequence="4">100 MILTON QUARTERLY a true sinner. Commenting on the article of the Creed, "He descended into hell," Calvin says that if Christ had undergone corporeal death only, then our bodies alone would have been redeemed, which is impossible; if, then, our souls have been redeemed, Christ must be said to have suffered the punishments which threatened them because of sin, that is, the punishments of eternal death. "Thus it was neces sary that Christ should wrestle hand to hand, as it were, with the hordes of hell and with the home of everlasting death .... If thus he is said to have descended into hell, there is nothing surprising in his having suffered the death which an enraged God inflicts upon criminals."31 Always remembering that Milton's primary source was the Bible itself, it is easy to see, perhaps, what particular branch of the satisfaction theory he adheres to. His God the Father says: Die hee or Justice must; unless for him Some other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. (Ill, 210-212) The final words, "death for death," recall the Cal vinistic doctrine that there has to be an equality between the death owed (Adam's eternal punishment) and Christ's sacrifice as the debt paid (death of both body and soul and the subsequent horror of hell). The wrath of the Father must be turned toward the Son: "Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life / I offer, on mee let thine anger fall" (III, ,236-237). He even implies that Satan himself is allowed some power over Christ: . . on me let Death wreck all his rage" (III, 241). Mankind is "under wrath" (III, 275), and the Son shall redeem him in order that "no cloud / Of anger shall remain ... I Wrath shall be no more" (III, 262-264). Milton was also influenced by the older "ransom" theory held by Irenaeus, Origen, and Augustine: ... so man, as is most just, Shall satisfy for Man, be judg'd and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransom'd with his own dear life. (Ill, 294-297) ... on Man's behalf Patron and Intercessor none appear'd. Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. (111,218-221) Curiously, Milton carries the metaphor to just those extremes that Origen and Augustine had carried it, extremes that Anselm, Aquinas, and even the Reformers had been careful to avoid: "Though now to death I yield, and am his due / All that of me can die, yet that debt paid . . (Ill, 245-246). He em ploys the legal terminology of Anselm and the Reformers, but seems to say that the debt is owed to Death, or Satan. On the basis of such few explicit texts, it is not possible to elaborate in detail a hypothetical system and then contend that Milton adopted that system. But that his general terminology accords with that used by Anselm, Luther, and Calvin is clear. There is evidence from his Christian Doctrine that he would agree with the main tenets of the Reformers: "This death [Christ's] was ignominious in the highest degree. The curse also, to which we were obnoxious, was transferred to him, accompanied with the dread ful consciousness of the pouring out of the divine wrath upon his head, which extorted from him the dying exclamation, Matt xxvii. 46."32 And to support this contention that he is, consciously or uncon sciously, following Calvin, when he says that Christ must pay a "death for death," he writes: "... for if Christ's death was real, his soul must have died on the same day with his body . . . ."33 He uses the legal terminology of "debt" and "ransom" throughout a section headed by this definition: "The satisfaction of Christ is the complete reparation made by him in his twofold capacity of God and man, by the. ful fillment of the law, and payment of the required price for all mankind."34 It is known that Milton read Augustine, Anselm, and the Reforming theologians; but Harris Fletcher has painstakingly searched out other, less obvious influences. Richard Stock, a Calvinist in theology, was the Rector of All Hallow's Parish on Bread Street where the Miltons lived and was their good friend when John was a young boy. An investigation into the sermons of this Anglican priest may discover a direct influence. Indeed, it was the custom at Cambridge when Milton was there for the students to attend more than one sermon on a Sunday. Mil ton's religious conscience must have been nurtured in some degree on these sermons. Future scholarship may uncover the extent of this hortatory influence. Thomas Young, Milton's first tutor, was more a Calvinist Puritan than an Anglican. William Chap pell, the tutor assigned to Milton at Cambridge, was a good friend of Joseph Mead who was "low Church," anti-prelatic, and Calvinistic.35 But the most important early influence, as far as religion is concerned, seems to be the Catechism</page><page sequence="5">MILTON QUARTERLY 101 NOTES which, according to Fletcher, was used at the time by all the teachers, from the "petty" schools to Cambridge and Oxford. It was Calvin's Catechism, variously called the Ursinus or Heidelberg Catechism. Questions 10, 14, 17, and 37 speak of the eternal "burden of God's wrath," with no qualification to mitigate such anthropomorphism.36 Question 12 says that "payment in full must be made to God's righteousness."37 It is interesting to note here, how ever, that payment is not being made to a captor, as in the very early formulation of the "ransom" analogy. The notion of "payment" and "debt" con tinues through Questions 13 and 14. Such an emphasis, especially considering that the memory was employed, undoubtedly had some effect on Milton's growing religious consciousness. Paradise Lost is, of course, a poem and not a theological treatise; but the theology is there for a purpose. Milton intended his readers to be persuaded by his "great argument." It may not be out of place to remark, therefore, that the noticeably austere character of the Father might have been assuaged by a less rigorous adherence to metaphors like "wrath," "payment," "debt," "ransom," and to a theological position that seems to demand a death for a death and a life for a life. More emphasis on the older theological doctrine that saw Christ's satis faction as an act of obedience and love, that saw Christ as taking upon himself the effects of sin and guilt rather than sin and guilt themselves, might have softened the Father's character. To introduce the Father at all, Milton was forced to be dangerously anthropomorphic; but to add to this the additional anthropomorphisms of "payment" and "wrath" seems to give an emotional tinge to Book III which is not quite counterbalanced by the assertion of the Son's love for men. Beyond this, however, one cannot speculate, for Milton has certainly preserved the essential message of all the theologians in his antinomy between Adam's disobedience and Christ's obedience; and the poem does work itself out dramatically within the context of the particular branch of the satisfaction theory he adopted.
