<plain_text><page sequence="1">127 HART CRANE'S INDIAN POEM In his large-scale national and historic poem The Bridge (1930), Hart Crane also wanted to deal with the American Indian and his function as part of the national lore, and the section called "The Dance" represents a climactic effort to revitalize the native past. In the recreation of the primitive mythic world of the Indian lies an important element of the "synthesis of America" that Crane intended to fashion in The Bridge . In a letter which he wrote to his patron Otto Kahn on September 12, 1927, the poet provided an explanation of his aims, stating that the main idea of "The Dance" was to present a fusion of himself and the Indian by means of which he would take possession of the latter's spirit: Here one is on the pure mythical and smoky soil at last! Not only do I describe the conflict between the two races in this dance - I also become identified with the Indian and his world before it is over, which is the only method possible of ever really possessing the Indian and his world as a cultural factor. I think I really succeed in getting undçr the skin of this glorious and dying animal, in terms of expression, in symbols, which he himself would comprehend. Pocahontas (the continent) is the common basis of our meeting, she survives the extinction of the Indian, who finally, after being assumed into the elements of nature (as he understood them), persists only as a kind of "eye" in the sky, or as a star that hangs between day and night - "the twilight's dim perpetual throne." 1 During the writing of The Bridge Crane in his letters listed various books that he read, and in connection with "The Dance" D. H. Lawrence's The Plumed Serpent is particularly important, because it deals at length with certain Aztec or Toltec myths that are active in the poem. Crane mentioned the book in a letter to Gorham Munson of March 5, 1926, writing that "Only my interest in Maya and Toltec archaeology led me to order Lawrence's book." One should note that Crane used the professionally correct word in connection with the ancient Mexican culture, namely Toltec. The Toltecs created one of the most important civilizations of ancient Mexico, and their conquerors, the Aztecs, adopted and preserved it. Other evidence of the poet's interest in this subject is the fact that he went to Mexico in 1931 to write an epic poem on the Aztec king Monte- zuma. As early as 1926 he mentioned this project in a letter to his friend 1 The Letters of Hart Crane , ed. Brom Weber (Berkeley, 1965), p. 307.

He was here referring to the famous calendar employed by the Aztec dynasties, and at the end of "The Dance" there is an implication that its old mythic divisions of time are no longer in use and that "other calendars now stack the sky." Apart from Toltec, or Azteck, myths, Crane's poem seems to contain allusions to the myths of the Indians of North America as well, though no particular tribe or myth is specifically referred to. However, in the section of The Bridge called "The River" there is a reference to the old rain gods of the region of the Ozarks, and a part of the action of "The Dance" takes place somewhere in the state of New York, or the Hudson valley. Therefore it seems legitimate to look for elements of North American mythology as well as Aztec legends in the poem, though it may be that the latter are more easily detected. In his attempt to understand the essence of the American past, Crane accepted the Indian as the foremost guide to the land, and he makes this quite explicit in the "Quaker Hill" section, in which he surveys with dismay the spectacle of vulgar materialism as it manifests itself in the hotels and golf courses of modern New England, where the "persuasive suburban land agent" buys and sells the soil which was once the Promised Land of the early settlers of the continent. Thereby they degrade the earth that the Indian knew, symbolized in The Bridge by Pocahontas, the historic Indian maiden whom the poet has recreated as a native earth goddess. In "Quaker Hill" the old battles between white rangers and Indian warriors are in- voked, and the "Iroquis" is extolled as a true ancestor and guide for the questing poet: The resigned factions of the dead preside. Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow; But I must ask slain Iroquis to guide Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go: Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage . . ,x The poet must let himself be guided by the spirit of the Indian if he wants to recapture in his mind the promised land of America. By means of his poetic identification with the Indian in "The Dance" he tries to bridge the 1 The Complete Poems of Hart Crane , ed. Waldo Frank (New York* 1958), p. 51.

Drawing on various tribal myths Crane presents Pocahontas in the shape of maiden and goddess, and as a contrast to this figure he creates a male persona who is variously an Indian chieftain, the poet himself and the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, who manifested himself in the shape of a serpent with feathers and the morning star. By identifying himself with the Indian in his beliefs the poet takes part in a ritual burning of the chieftain which is accompanied by the latter's apotheosis as a star. Within the mythic vision of the Indian Crane begins with the beginning, the genesis of the earth, which in many myths is accounted for as the fall of a goddess from the sky at the beginning of time. This goddess becomes the universal mother, and from her body grows the earth itself. An ancient Iroquis legend relates how the woman Ataensic fell through a rift in the sky which separated heaven and earth and plunged into the primeval waters beneath. After giving birth to two sons she died, but was resurrected again in the organic life of the soil.1 The opening stanza of "The Dance" offers a dramatic portrait of Pocahontas which seems to have been influenced by a myth of this kind : The swift red flesh, a winter king - Who squired the glacier woman down the sky? She ran the neighing canyons all the spring; She spouted arms; she rose with maize - to die. As earth mother, Pocahontas is also a fertility goddess and is made the object of the death and rebirth ritual commonly associated with such deities. In the spring she rises to life in the growing maize and in the autumn she dies again, only to be resurrected next spring. The opening line presents the sexual opposi tes that run through the poem: the "red flesh" of the maiden, which denotes the soil itself, and her lover, the "winter king," who later occupies the "throne" of the "twilight" as a star. From this venture into a mythic, timeless past, a transition is made to 1 According to Daniel G. Brinton Ataensic "threw herself through a rift in the sky and fell toward the earth . . . Her body was buried, and from it sprang the various vegetable productions which the new earth required to fit it for the habitation of man. From her head grew the pumpkin vine; from her breast, the maize; from her limbs, the bean . . ." Cf.

The spiritual barrenness created by the white man's invasion is symbolized by an autumn drouth: And in the autumn drouth, whose burnished hands With mineral wariness found out the stone Where prayeřs, forgotten, streamed the mesa sands? He holds the twilight's dim, perpetual throne. i The protagonist here is the poet, who in his search for the mythic past holds the key to a new cultural fusion of the two races. He can recover the spirit of the Indian and inhabit "the twilight's dim, perpetual throne," the abode of the Indian gods of the dawn. The reference to the sands of the "mesa" mountains shows that the poet is exploring the Indian myths of the southwestern part of the continent, in which these particular moun- tains are found. Here he goes in search of the old rain gods of the mythology of the Aztecs. According to one of their stories, a big stone once fell from heaven and broke into many pieces, each of which became a god. They also believed that a stone was shot from the sky with each thunderclap. Thunder was followed by rain, and the stones became rain gods.1 The poet finds such a stone, or totem, and invokes the "forgotten prayers" associated with it. The first two stanzas summarize the whole spiritual action of the poem: the absorption of the mythic consciousness of the Indian. They form the first division of "The Dance" and foreshadow the more detailed fictional expedition of the poet into the Indian past. But first he identifies himself with the white explorers in general as they broke into the American wil- derness: Mythical brows we saw retiring - loth, Disturbed and destined, into denser green. Greeting they sped us, on the arrow's oath: Now lie incorrigibly what years between ... 1 On pp. 48-49 of the same work Brinton says: "In the calendar of the Aztecs the day and god Tecpatl, the Flint-Stoae, 'held a prominent position. ^According to their myths such a stoņ# fell fröm^heaven; at the beginning of time and broke into sixteen hundred pieces, each of which became a., god." In his book Atlantis in America (New York, 1926), which Crane read, Lewis Spence speaks of the Maya thundérgod whose image was a stone: "The flint or thundeťsjtone was the chisel of the Maya masons and sculptors, the magical implement that shaped the idol and the pyramid" (p. 199).</page><page sequence="5">Hart Crane's Indian Poem 131 The "brows" belong to Pocahontas, the personification of nature, and she recedes before the white invasion, "disturbed" by the conquerors and "destined" to become subdued. Crane was not alone in envisaging such a goddess. In his In the American Grain , which Crane read, William Carlos Williams presented a female personage who symbolizes virginal America in a chapter of the book which deals with the expedition of the Spanish explorer De Soto to the Mississippi/ She adresses De Soto in words like these: "See how I have fled you, dashing into a lake there to freeze all night, coming forth at dawn, half drowned, my brows hidden in lily lea- ves."1 For Crane the brows of Pocahontas suggest the Indian's mythic consciousness of a living universe, and though the years of the white man's history in America "lie incorrigibly" between past and present, the poet nevertheless embarks on his Indian pilgrimage in order to bridge the gap between the two cultures. Pocahontas is seen as a bride awaiting her mate on "a bed of leaves," wearing a veil, and she is wooed by the Indian chieftain with which Crane identifies himself. In "The Harbor Dawn" section of The Bridge , the poet envisaged a sexual union with Pocahontas in a dreampicture: "Serenely now, before day claims our eyes / Your cool arms murmurously about me lay," and as he embraces the maiden he exclaims: "A forest shudders in your hair!" Pocahontas represents an anthropomorphic conception of nature, and throughout "The Dance" the landscape is described in terms of the female body with a "brown lap" and "bridal flanks and eyes." Thus the poet tries to restore the "broken play" of the mythic rituals by means of which the Indian maintained his harmonious rapport with nature, and he sets out in pursuit of the earth-goddess in a journey through time and space: I left the village for dogwood. By the canoe Tugging below the mill-race, I could see Your hair's keen crescent running, and the blue First moth of evening take wing stealthily. What laughing chains the water wove and threw! I learned to catch the trout's moon whisper; I 1 Williams, In the American Grain (Norfolk, Conn., 1925). p. 54. Williams has since confirmed that Crane was influenced by his book: "The chapter on De Soto was used by Hart Crane in 'The Bridge' - he took what he wanted, why shouldn't he - that's what writing is for." Cf. Williams' I Wanted to Write a Poem (London, 1967), p. 54.</page><page sequence="6">132 HELGE NORMANN NILSEN Drifted how many hours I never knew, But, watching, saw that fleet young crescent die, - And one star, swinging, take its place, alone, Cupped in the larches of the mountain pass - Until, immortally, it bled into the dawn . . . The whole magic of the Indian world, the pristine beauty of his original, natural environment, is superbly evoked here. The journey up the Hudson river in a canoe suggests the first, legendary expeditions of the white man into Indian territory, and it thus brings in the theme of the American frontier, which is important in The Bridge and particularly in "The River." In a letter to Mrs. T. W. Simpson, July 4, 1927, Crane explained that this section was an attempt to "chart the pioneer experience of our forefathers." In "The River" the reader is carried across the country from New York to the Mississippi, and thereby, the poet wrote further, "I also unlatch the door to the pure Indian world which opens out in 'The Dance' section, so the reader is gradually led back in time to the pure savage world, while existing at the same time in the present." The moth which rises from the "laughing chains" of the river waters surrounding the canoe symbolizes the upward flight toward the freedom which the Indian possesses after his metamorphosis, described further on in the poem. The image is parallelled in the opening stanza of "To Brooklyn Bridge," the introductory poem of The Bridge , in which a seagull is observed near the bridge, its wings hurling it, "building high / Over the chained bay waters Liberty." Here is a reference to the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor, but in both poems we have closely corresponding sequences of imagery, winged flights over waters that are chained, imprisoned by land. The star that appears over the river disappears, "immortally," at sunrise, and one should be aware that both Quetzalcoatl and his Iroquois counterpart Ioskeha, son of Ataensic the earth-mother, are gods of the dawn and manifest themselves in the shape of the morning star. After leaving his boat by the river and climbing a "portage" and a "further valley-shed," the protagonist is beckoned on by glimpses of Pocahontas. He sees her feet in the "wat'ry webs" of mountain falls, and the leap of the stream over the edge of the rock becomes her "white veil." The whiteness of the veil relates it to the symbolic function of the color white in The Bridge: from the "white rings" of the seagull in "To Brooklyn</page><page sequence="7">Hart Crane's Indian Poem 133 Bridge" and the "White Birds" of the "Ave Maria" section, whiteness recurs as a symbol of purity and beauty until it culminates in the "whitest flower" of the mystic, unitive vision that is presented in "Atlantis," the finale of The Bridge . The poet approaches an Indian village, and a forest scene is evoked, with tepees "tufting the blue knolls" and smoke swirling up between the trees of a "yellow chestnut glade." Here, in a "boding shade," he anti- cipates the drama of the ensuing rituals. In the growing thunderstorm the powers of nature second the ritual drama of the extinction and meta- morphosis of the chieftain Maquokeeta. His dance and the storm itself are fused in a coherent chain of imagery. The growing "thunder-bud" that moves across the sky refers to the gathering clouds, and then is heard the "rhythm" of a "padded foot within" in the sounds of the thunder. Here is a suggestion that the gods of the thunder are at work in their cosmic dance.1 By identifying himself with the Indian and conceiving of nature in his primitive mythic manner, the poet is renewed and reborn into a primeval state of being. This experience drains the "black pool" of the influence of modern civilization from his "heart's hot root." Maquokeeta's dance and subsequent burning at the stake are dramatized as universal events, and further allusions to Indian myth enter into the poetic texture: A cyclone threshes in the turbine crest, Swooping in eagle feathers down your back; Know, Maquokeeta, greeting; know death's best; Fall, Sachem, strictly as the tamarack! A birch kneels. All her whistling fingers fly. The oak grove circles in a crash of leaves; The long moan of a dance is in the sky. Dance, Maquokeeta: Pocahontas grieves . . . And every tendon scurries toward the twangs Of lightning deltaed down your saber hair. Now snaps the flint in every tooth, red fangs And splay tongues thinly busy the blue air . . . 1 Lewis Spence informs us that Haokah, a Sioux thundergod, "beat the tattoo of the thunder on his great drum, using the wind as a drumstick." Çf. The Myths of the North American Indians (London, 1914), p. 125,</page><page sequence="8">134 HELGE NORMANN NILSJEN Maquokeeta's is a dance of death, and it reflects and blends with the violent winds of the storm. The "eagle feathers" of his costume point to the serpent and eagle symbolism at the end of the poem, and it also con- nects him with nature insofar as the eagle is an Indian god associated with wind, thunder and lightning. The impending death of the chieftain is dramatized as the fall of a tamarack, and this reference to a tree refers back to the poet's canoe trip and the star that he saw between the "larches" of the mountains. The fall of the Sachem, or leader, is seconded by a tur- bulent dance of the powers of nature in the climax of the thunderstorm. The birches and oaks are being bent by the wind and the leaves are hurled into the air. Crane undoubtedly employs the pathetic fallacy here; Poca- hontas "grieves," she is nature mourning the destruction of her child the Indian. In nearly all Indian myths there is widespread worship of the snake, and snake-gods abound. According to one belief the lightning is a great serpent, and the reason for believing in this is that both snakes and light- ning move with rapid, flashing darts and turns. Crane uses serpentine imagery in his picture of the lightning that strikes down to earth along the "saber hair" of Pocahontas. The fire which is going to consume the chief- tain is being lit by the lightning, and the flames are conceived in terms of serpents' "red fangs" and "splay tongues." The metaphor of fire as a serpent foreshadows the subsequent metamorphosis by fire of Maquokeeta in the shape of Quetzalcoatl, the "plumed serpent." The Indian performs his snake dance, and in the following burning at the stake the poet himself merges with him: Dance, Maquokeeta! snake that lives before, That casts his pelt, and lives beyond! Sprout, horn! Spark, tooth! Medicine-man, relent, restore - Lie to us, - dance us back the tribal morn! Spears and assemblies; black drums thrusting on - 0 yelling battlements, - I, too, was liege To rainbows currying each puisant bone: Surpassed the circumstance, danced out the siege! And buzzard-circleted, screamed from the stake; 1 could not pick the arrows from my side. Wrapped in that fire, I saw more escorts wake - flickering, sprint up the hill groins like a tjdc,</page><page sequence="9">Hart Crane's Indian Poem 135 The snake dance is a ritual practiced by many Indian tribes, and anthro- pologists have interpreted it variously as a fertility and immortality rite. In the present context the dance symbolizes the apotheosis of Maquokeeta. Though physically destroyed, the Indian achieves immortality by being transformed into a star, and the dance is a ritual expression of this. Ac- cording to primitive belief the snake, with its habit of casting its skin, is an immortal creature. By performing rituals and ceremonies with snake skins, the Indians believed that they would gain immortality. The refer- ence to sprouting horns carries the same meaning as the snake dance - the deer casts off its antlers in the process of growth. In his rendering of the metamorphosis of Maquokeeta, Crane has employed the myth of Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god who departed from his empire, ascended into heaven and became the morning star. According to what he says in his letters, the poet must have been familiar with more than one version of this myth. Deena P. Metzger, who has studied the influence of the Quetzalcoatl legend on The Bridge , claims that "the direct sources of Crane's knowledge of the salient elements of the myths were probably Orpheus and William H. Prescotťs History of the Conquest of Mexico .x Metzger is here referring to Padraic Colum's book Orpheus : Myths of the World (1930). Crane knew Colum personally, and Metzger holds that the poet may have got the outline of the Quetzalcoatl myth from him through conversation and used it in the poem in spite of the fact that The Bridge was published in the same year as Colum's book. All versions of the Quetzalcoatl myth agree on the point that he was to return to Mexico in the shape of a white man with a long beard, and we know that the Aztec ruler Montezuma and his people thought that Cortez and his conquistadors were returning gods who came to institute a new order. For Crane this notion became a central part of the pattern of quest for a new world that dominates The Bridge as a whole.2 However, none of the two versions of the myth that Metzger mentions seem to be the one 1 Metzger, "Hart Crane's Bridge: the Myth Active, " Arizona Quarterly , XX (1964), 37. The author does not deal with the mythic allusions in "The Dance" in any detail in her article, but provides glimpses of the connections between Indian myths and the whole of The Bridge. 2 One of the best explanations of the function of this theme of Crane's in The Bridge is Alan Trachtenberg's chapter, "The Shadow of a Myth," in his Brooklyn Bridge: Fact and Symbol CNew York, 1965), pp. 143-165.</page><page sequence="10">136 HELGE NORMANN NILSEN Crane used when he wrote "The Dance." In Prescott's History the god sails away from the land in a wizard skiff, and Colum repeated this story and gave an additional one according to which the god threw himself into a funeral pyre on the shore and his heart rose and became the morning star. According to D. H. Lawrence's The Plumed Serpent , a book which Metzger disregards, Quetzalcoatl throws himself into a pyre on the top of a volcanic mountain. This version is employed by Crane, and we know that he read Lawrence's work. Quetzalcoatl was the god of art and culture, and both his departure and return were events of great importance in the religious tradition of the Aztecs. His return was believed to signal the creation of a new civilization and thus had both a tragic and heroic aspect. The myth thus readily lent itself to a function as symbol of the promise that America will become a new and glorious world. This American dream lies at the centre of The Bridge . In Lawrence's version, Quetzalcoatl "climbed the steep of the mountain, and over the white snow of the volcano ... So the old god reached the top of the mountain and looked into the blue house of heaven . . . The fire rose from the volcano around the old Quetzalcoatl, in wings and glittering feathers. And with the wings of fire and the glitter of sparks Quetzalcoatl flew up, up, like a wafting fire, like a glittering bird, up, into the space, and away to the white steps of heaven . . . Night fell, and Quetzalcoatl was gone, and men in the world saw only a star travelling back into heaven."1 This is how Crane tells the same story in his poetry: I heard the hush of lava wrestling your arms, And stag teeth foam about the raven throat; Flame cataracts of heaven in seething swarms Fed down your anklets to the sunset's moat. O, like the lizard in the furious noon, That drops his legs and colors in the sun, - And laughs, pure serpent, Time itself, and moon Of his own fate, I saw thy change begun! And saw thee dive to kiss that destiny Like one white meteor, sacrosanct and blent At last with all that's consummate and free There, where the first and last gods keep thy tent. 1 Lawrence, The Plumed Serpent (London, 1926), p. 220.</page><page sequence="11">Hart Crane* s Indian Poem 137 The first of these stanzas describe the burning of the god on top of the volcano. In the second we have the apotheosis, and the serpentine imagery of the snake dance is reintroduced. According to the old belief, Quetzalcoatl assumed the shapes of both bird and snake, he was the feathered serpent whose image is carved in stone in the Aztec temples. The etymological meaning of the very name Quetzalcoatl is in fact "serpent with feathers." By turning himself into a "pure Serpent" the Indian, as Quetzalcoatl, has conquered "Time itself," obtained immortality. Here we have to bear in mind another meaning of the serpent symbol in primitive thought. The image of a snake biting its own tail, thus forming a circle, is a mythic symbol of eternity. The chieftain, in the shape of the plumed serpent, has reached a paradise which is "consummate and free," and with considerable emotion Crane presents the beauty of the Indian myth. It was not unusual to attribute such an importance to the culture of the Indian in the nineteentwenties. Both Archibald McLeish, William Carlos Williams and Waldo Frank dealt with this question, and Frank maintained that the Indian was the one who really had a unique sense of nature and reality in America: "The Indian's culture is prophetic of what our culture must be. His nature is a guide to the understanding and achievement of our own . . . The Amerind was profoundly, beautifully adjusted to the land."1 At the end of "The Dance," the mythic past is left behind, and the poet, in his own time, addresses the Indian, who now has taken possession of the throne of the twilight as winter king, morning star and bridegroom of Pocahontas. From his timeless abode he gazes into history and the "an- gered slain," the Indian victims of the white man's conquests. The tran- scendent immortality achieved by the chieftain is parallelled by the organic immortality of the maize goddess, the earth-mother Pocahontas: Thewed of the levin, thunder-shod and lean, Lo, through what infinite seasons dost thou gaze - Across what bivouacs of thine angered slain, And sees thy bride immortal in the maize! Totem and fire-gall, slumbering pyramid - Though other calendars now stack the sky, Thy freedom is her largesse, Prince, and hid On paths thou knewest best to claim her by. 1 Frank, In the American Jungle: 1925-1936 (New York, 1937), pp. 125-126.</page><page sequence="12">138 HELOE NORMANN NILSEN The second stanza offers a view of the Mexican, or southwest American landscape as it is today, with temples and totems which the Aztecs left behind as evidence of their faith. Their famous calendar, believed to have been invented by Quetzalcoatl, is no longer in use, and with it has vanished the mythic, teleological concept of time of the race. The poet participates in the Indian's rapport with the land in its beauty and fertility, embracing his Pocahontas: High unto Labrador the sun strikes free Her speechless dream of snow, and stirred again, She is the torrent and the singing tree; And she is virgin to the last of men . . . West, west and south! winds over Cumberland And winds across the llano grass resume Her hair's warm sibilance. Her breasts are fanned O stream by slope and vineyard - into bloom! The poet has attained the anthropomorphic consciousness of the savage and employs his symbolism to create a panoramic vision of the land. Here as elsewhere in The Bridge , Crane goes back to a basic habit, found in all mythologies, of conceiving the earth in terms of the human body. That Pocahontas should be a virgin is quite natural, because this distinction is typical of most universal mother figures of mythology.1 In the conclusion of "The Dance," the poet again addresses Maquokeeta and recalls the dance: And when the caribou slant down for salt Do arrows thirst and leap? Do antlers shine Alert, star-triggered in the listening vault Of dusk? - And are her perfect brows to thine? We danced, O Brave, we danced beyond their farms, In cobalt desert closures made our vows . . . Now is the strong prayer folded in thine arms, The serpent with the eagle in the boughs. 1 "In mythologies emphasizing the maternal rather than the paternal aspect of the creator, this original female fills the world stage in the beginnings, playing the roles that are elsewhere assigned to males. And she is virgin, because her spouse is the Invisible Unknown." Cf. Joseph Campbell, The Hero with the Thousand Faces (New York, 1949), p. 297. CampelPs book is a thorough study of the hero-myth in various religions.</page><page sequence="13">Hart Crane's Indian Poem 139 This is a beautiful evocation of a hunting scene with Indians on the watch and alert deer, but the implications are also wider. The poet asks himself whether he has succeeded in recreating the Indian world and merg- ing with Pocahontas, and in the last stanza he answers the question in the affirmative and claims that the union of himself and the Indian has been achieved and the harmonious vision of Pocahontas assimilated. The perfec- tion and symmetry of the Indian worldview are symbolized by the united serpent and eagle, which suggest his consciousness of the land as a com- prehensible and harmonious whole. The meaning of the symbolism is indicated by Crane himself in "The River," in which the eagle is said to represent space and the serpent time in the Pocahontas emblem: "Time like a serpent down her shoulder, dark, / And space, an eaglet's wing, laid on her hair." Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent, is also suggested in the final line of "The Dance," and thus the theme of the returning god and the founding of a new world is repeated.
