<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Selby A Darker Shade of Green: The Importance of Ecological Thinking in Global Education and School Reform N RECENT YEARS, THE IDEA OF "GREENING" schools has achieved fairly common currency. School curricula incorporate environmental themes and topics. Mission statements are tinged with green (albeit a faded green in these days of "back to basics" and economic retrenchment). Composters are commonplace. Indigenous vegetation is replac- ing concrete in many a schoolyard as school ground naturalization proceeds apace. Recycling is replac- ing the throwaway ethic. Significant as such developments are, they can easily seduce us into believing that they amount to a sufficient educational response to the environmental crisis we face. On a spectrum of greenness, they could be located among the lighter shades of green, espe- cially if not nested within a multidimensional strate- gy for curriculum and school reform, drawing its inspiration from fundamental ecological principles and a radical reconceptualization of humankind's rela- tionship with the environment. Darker Shades of Green The darker shades of green are predicated upon a "new ethic in which violent, plundering humankind abandons its destructive ways, recog- nizes its dependence on Planet Earth, and starts David Selby is professor and director of the International Institute for Global Education and acting associate dean (research) at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Educa- tion of the University of Toronto. living on a more equal footing with the rest of nature" (Porritt &amp; Winner, 1988, p. 11). They present a deep and transformative, as against shal- low and reformist, ecological perspective within which "the fundamental presuppositions underly- ing the dominant economic approach" are laid bare and radical changes identified and acted upon (Naess, 1995, pp. 75-76). Dark green proponents see the ecological cri- sis as at root a cultural crisis-a direct outcome of the dominant western mechanistic worldview with its foundations in 17th- and 18th-century scientific notions of separation and domination. The influ- ence of Descartes's division of res cogita (mind) and res extensa (mechanical extended substances or matter) and his arrogation of mind exclusively to humans has led to our locating ourselves out- side and above nature. It has also led to our ascrib- ing only instrumental value to nature, denying ethical and moral status to other life forms and the environment, and, thus, allowing ourselves unfet- tered license to exploit (Bateson, 1973, p. 436; Capra, 1996, p. 7). While fueling the hubris of uniqueness, it has fostered our modern sense of alienation and existential crisis. "We are distinct from everything around us and inexorably alone" (Zohar, 1990, p. 34). The dualisms spawned by Cartesian thought (e.g., human/animal, mind/body, masculine/feminine, reason/emotion, spirit/matter, culture/nature), and the THEORY INTO PRACTICE, Volume 39, Number 2, Spring 2000 Copyright ? 2000 College of Education, The Ohio State University 0040-5841/2000$1.50</page><page sequence="2">Selby A Darker Shade of Green hegemonic thinking they inspire, are replaced in a dark green philosophy by a worldview that per- ceives reality not as a collection of discrete and isolated entities but as a dynamic relational web, an "unbroken wholeness" (Bohm, 1983). Humans are a strand within that relational web. To unite those aspects of our nature that have been frag- mented and distorted by the Cartesian worldview, "we have to regain our experience of connected- ness with the entire web of life" (Capra, 1996, p. 296). In this very real sense, "the needs of the person are the needs of the planet" (Roszak, 1992, p. 321). Dark green thinking thus calls for a shift from an anthropocentric (human-centered) philosophy, with its built-in biospheric inegalitarianism, to a biocentric (life-centered) philosophy. The latter recognizes that we are embedded within the envi- ronment, that reverence rather than ruthlessness is due to the natural world, that culture is in the final analysis grounded in nature, that consciousness is within everything, that however special and com- plex our own form of consciousness, ecosystems and all living beings possess intrinsic value (Greig, Pike, &amp; Selby, 1989, p. 9; Zohar, 1990). Those embracing a dark green philosophy also recognize "green" to be more than a synonym for "environmental." They view issues of culture, de- velopment, environmental and social justice, equi- ty, health, and peace to be seamless and inseparable. In this regard, they recognize the correlation and intersection of human and non-human oppressions. Ecofeminists see sexism, racism, classism, specie- sism, and the oppression of nature as "mutually reinforcing systems of oppression" (Gaard, 1993, p. 5). Social ecologists argue that the domination of nature by humans has its roots in the domina- tion of human by human and that it is therefore important to "critique and challenge all forms of hierarchy and domination, not just our civilization's attempt to dominate and plunder the natural world" (Bookchin, 1994, p. 123). The abuse and oppression of animals at both a conceptual and concrete level is held by humane educators to feed from and into oppression of hu- mans on grounds of gender, ethnicity, and race (Bell &amp; Russell, 1999; Selby, 1995, pp. 17-22). All forms of hegemony, thus, need to be addressed, and those seeking to loosen hegemonic structures and processes within human society also need to avoid collusion in the oppression of other-than- human lifeforms. Toward a Biocentric Global Education Some global educators are taking up the chal- lenge of dark green thinking and asking themselves what a biocentric rendition of global education would look like. Underpinning such a project is a realization that global education theory and prac- tice has, for the most part, been informed by an insufficient rebuttal of mechanism. In particular the readings of concepts such as interdependence, interconnectedness, and interrelatedness have tend- ed to reflect a "higher order of reductionism" (i.e., an intricate relationship between still separate parts) inspired by the complex mechanism of the com- puter (Roszak, 1992, p. 169) rather than an eco- logical or holistic understanding of the terms. While theoretical models, and associated curriculums, have depicted complex interactions between entities (individuals, communities, nation states, non-state actors), those entities are still largely conceived of as primary, solid, and separate. A biocentric global education, on the other hand, would embrace the notion of "relational ho- lism" (Teller, 1986) in which relationship is pri- mary and takes place between phenomena that are themselves processes rather than static components (Capra, 1996, p.168). Embracing such a radical read- ing of interconnectedness-captured in terminology such as enfoldedness, embeddedness, and interpene- tration-has profound practical consequences for the agenda and structure of learning communities. Biocentric global education would entail a further shift away from an essentially national or inter-national curricular framework toward a more genuinely multi-leveled global curriculum, within which the local, provincial, bioregional, national, and planetary would be perceived of as in dynamic and enfolded relationship. But this would not be the globalism of the "terminal Cenozoic"-indus- trial, competitive, consumerist, and market-driven- but one predicated upon promoting the well being of the entire biotic community (O'Sullivan, 1999); and one that also responds to an emerging sense of the earth as our " 'locality' in the galactic wilder- ness" (Roszak, 1992, p. 95). 89</page><page sequence="3">THEORY INTO PRACTICE / Spring 2000 GLOBAL EDUCATION / Viewed From Around the World Radical interconnectedness also connotes a synergistic interplay between our outer and inner worlds; between planetary and personal well be- ing. The learning experience would thus become more personal, intimate, even narcissistic (in the self-in-world, world-in-self sense) in its encour- agement of self-discovery. Global education mod- els and curriculums seemingly constructed "as if what was inside of us was not also part of the universe" (Roszak, 1992, p. 14) would be tempered to embrace a complementary inner journeying. This would help reawaken and reconnect as- pects of personhood suppressed by the same forc- es-a mechanistic worldview allied to rampant industrialism-that lie behind environmental de- spoilation. Disciplines enabling students to explore their inner ecology, cultivate their attunement to their senses and body rhythms, and, thus, develop an embodied relationship with the natural world- contemplative and therapeutic art, dance, breath- ing exercises, yoga, meditation-would become valued features of the learning process. Also characterizing darker green or biocen- tric education would be whole school and school- in-community learning and celebratory experiences reaffirming the embeddedness of human life, cul- ture, and society within nature. Students would learn how our very humanity draws succor from the earth and is diminished as we diminish the earth. The story of the radical interconnectedness of people, other lifeforms, places, and events with- in a complex web of relationships would, for dif- ferent purposes in different ways and using different media, be constantly retold. The pruden- tial case for environmental respect emanating from that story (that is, that actions and behaviors that degrade the environment eventually adversely im- pact human quality of life and survival prospects) would be drawn out. But arguments from prudence would not obscure the need for curriculums round- ly predicated upon the integrity, intrinsic value, and, hence, moral status of natural environments and non-human life forms (Bell &amp; Russell, 1999; Selby, 1995, pp. 6-16). The spotlight would also inevitably fall upon inequitable and unsustainable levels of consumer- ism and resource exploitation that light green pro- grams, recycling for instance, in their implicit suggestion that rampant consumerism can be made environmentally benign or neutral, often serve to obfuscate. The thrust would not be ascetic or puri- tanical but would propose and foster new, sustain- able conceptions of quality of life and conviviality. Disciplinary Convergence Any educational expression of biocentric globalism would necessarily involve disciplinary con- vergence. The deep science-humanities segregation that typifies the curriculum of most schools is reflec- tive of the Cartesian nature-human divide. Environ- mental themes and topics are often left to the science class where both the training and inclination of the teacher tends to exclude engagement with the cultur- al, ideological, political, social, and spiritual aspects of environment. Consideration of culture and soci- ety is left to the social studies classroom, where most themes considered are de-natured. Within the "educations" often conceived of as falling under the umbrella of global education-such as devel- opment, environmental, human rights, and peace education-there would need to be fuller recogni- tion of their "family likeness" (Selby, 1999, pp. 134-135). Within the counter-hegemonic educa- tions-anti-classist, anti-homophobic, anti-racist, and anti-sexist education-it would be important to recognize the mutually-reinforcing nature of human and non-human oppressions. A biocentric global education also speaks to the need for an ecology of learning approaches and an acceptance that knowledge is received and internalized in myriad ways. It is a feature of the mechanistic mindset that reason is valued above intuition, thought above feeling, objectivity above subjectivity. An outcome of prevailing mechanism has been that learning has continued to be episte- mologically underdimensioned (i.e., confined to rational, analytical means of knowing) and learning approaches confined to a narrow range. This denial of learning style diversity has, of itself, stifled the voice of the earth for generations of students. As Ruether (1983, pp. 89-90) maintains, ra- tionalist and linear modes of knowing are "ecolog- ically dysfunctional." We need to recover and give full rein to relational and holistic modes of know- ing that are environmentally mindful and respon- sive-modes marginalized within the dominant 90</page><page sequence="4">Selby A Darker Shade of Green rationalistic worldview but through which "a sense of wonder" (Carson, 1956, pp. 42-43) can be con- stantly revitalized. We must respond to a "thou-ness" in all beings. This is not romanticism or an anthropomorphic animism that sees "dryads in trees," although there is truth in the animist view. . . . We respond not just as "I to it," but as "I to thou," to the spirit, the life energy that lies in every being in its own form of existence. (Ruether, 1983, p. 87) Learning of ways of knowing within traditional and indigenous communities (Traina, 1995, p. 20) is a vital element in the recovery of earth-sensitive learning, as is the development of sensual learning approaches involving direct engagement with na- ture. The argument here is not for the rejection of the rational but rather for the reclaiming and equal valuing of emotion, subjectivity, caring, and intu- ition, as ways of knowing (Selby, 1996). Ecological School Reform It has been a feature of school change initia- tives of the lighter green persuasion that they have tended to set little store by ecological principles in seeking to foster green schools. By choice in some cases but often in recognition of the constraints and realities under which they have been asked to work, environmental and global educators have opted for a restricted change focus (e.g., develop- ing a curriculum for a specific grade and school subject; schoolyard naturalization; reduce, re-use, recycle programs; environmental auditing/monitor- ing). They have thereby minimized the importance of, or had to put on hold, broad-based school mo- bilization behind an environmentally and globally responsive ethic through helping instigate, galva- nize, and connect multiple initiatives within the school and community. Fragmented in conception and implementation, their initiatives often prove unsustainable. Schools aspiring to a darker shade of green would seek to inform their organization, relation- ships, and processes of change with basic ecologi- cal principles: strength in diversity; continuous movement and fluctuations; energy flows, cycles, and undulations; countless forms of partnership; coevolution through the processes of creation and mutual adaptation; the tensile dynamic between the assertive and integrative tendencies of any organ- ism, sub-group, or sub-system (Center for Ecolit- eracy, 1993; Selby, 1997). Insights into the nature of change drawn from ecology happily overlap with what specialists in educational change are telling us. Successful and sustainable school change, Fullan (1997) suggests, requires coherence, integration, diversity, continu- ous skills development, the creation of collabora- tive work cultures, multiple foci of change with multi-directional communication flows across the school and community, and a broadening of the leadership net to include as many teachers, par- ents, and students as possible. The role of external change agents is not to represent "one more project" but to interrelate with "the total reform agenda of the school." Such fundamentally ecological thinking about the nature of change, allied to a nascent vision of biocentric global education, lay behind the Ontario Green Schools Project (OGSP) in its endeavors to help green seven project schools (four elementary, three secondary) and several associated schools in southern Ontario between 1993 and 1996. Strands of Green Following preliminary discussions with ad- ministrators, teachers, students, parents, and com- munity members, the OGSP team (comprising two project co-directors from the International Insti- tute for Global Education, University of Toronto, and two teachers on loan) lighted upon six strands in its work with schools: school ground naturaliza- tion, school plant, school ethos, curriculum, tele- communications, and community. School ground naturalization focused on helping the schools re- landscape and naturalize their yards using indige- nous flora, while the school plant strand involved developing and implementing energy and water conservation and waste reduction initiatives. The remaining four strands were "green" in the dark green understanding of the term and hence by no means exclusively concerned with the natu- ral environment. Woven into the school ethos strand was the development of whole-school policies and practices to foster environmental concern and respon- siveness but also to promote social justice, multicul- turalism, holistic health, safe schools, citizenship, and 91</page><page sequence="5">THEORY INTO PRACTICE / Spring 2000 GLOBAL EDUCATION / Viewed From Around the World democracy across the school community. Through the curriculum strand, we sought to imbue identi- fied curriculum areas at various grade levels with biocentric and global perspectives. We also encour- aged learning diversity and inner journeying through experimentation with forms of coopera- tive and interactive learning, guided fantasy and visualization, multisensory learning, movement and dance, drama and role play, and meditation and relaxation. The telecommunications strand afforded op- portunities to experiment with inter-school dia- logue, by means of Internet and videophone, around global and environmental themes both within Can- ada and internationally. The community strand sought to optimize the involvement of parents and other community members in the greening of the school and also to increase student engagement with the local community and natural environment. Given the holistic thinking inspiring the project, why did we elect to identify discrete project strands? Early discussions with administrators and teachers confirmed our initial sense that to give undue weight to holistic conceptualizations and goals at the outset of the change process would run up against the essentially fragmentalized cul- ture of schools and what has been termed the "prac- ticality ethic"-that is, the criteria of likely needs fulfillment that teachers apply to initiatives rec- ommended to them (Fullan, 1991, pp. 128-129). We saw our challenge as, first, to encourage and support the implementation of the strands in each school and, as the teachers moved away from any initial ambivalence and as they acquired confidence and experience, to work with them to identify in- terconnections and optimize flows between the strands. Second, we saw the promotion of discrete strands as a means of broadening the leadership net within the school and community. It was sug- gested to the administration in each school that teachers be encouraged to form small teams to take responsibility for implementing and, later, promot- ing each strand. It was also suggested that non-teach- ing staff, parents, community members, and students be included on each team. Hence, volunteer "key teachers" and other members of the school commu- nity attended the full-day workshops held to launch each strand and subsequently took responsibility for its development (including further workshops) in the school. Third, we also felt that by proposing six nodal points of development within each school (in some cases, additional or alternative ones sprung up), we were helping provide the diversity essen- tial to sustainability and, through a devolved (and subsequently networked) structure, increasing the likelihood of school-wide mobilization behind a green ethic. The Greening of Two Schools The schools discussed here are kindergarten to grade 8 urban schools of, in 1994, 670 and 410 students respectively. Both are located in the same small city in southern Ontario. The principal of the first school was initially attracted to the project as a means of promoting interdisciplinary curriculum but became very quickly excited by its biocentric philosophy (and later encouraged the adoption of the wolf as the school symbol). The principal of the sec- ond saw involvement in the project as a means of fostering greater openness and cohesion among the teaching staff and of "improving the quality of learning and living in the school." An early step at both schools was a day work- shop on the project and global education for teach- ing and support staff (with parent/community representatives also attending). The messages of the workshop were reinforced by follow-up visits by members of the OGSP team and the principals, sig- naling their encouragement to teachers and others to coalesce into focus groups to provide the initial im- petus for the implementation of project strands. Most focus group members subsequently attended the day workshop on their chosen project strand, which was offered to all project schools by the OGSP team. Here follow snapshots of focus group activi- ties covering five of the six strands (the ethos strand is considered in the next section of the article): Curriculum First school. The grade 7 teaching team framed their year's teaching around themes includ- ing animal/human relationships, environment, human rights, and future-oriented issues. Interactive and ex- periential learning approaches were used throughout, and students took part in visualization sessions, deep breathing exercises, peer massage, and sensory 92</page><page sequence="6">Selby A Darker Shade of Green learning in nature. Within the program, students explored: different kinds and levels of intercon- nection within human society, interpersonal to glo- bal, and between humans and nature, developing their own declarations of interdependence (Pike &amp; Selby, 1999, pp. 54-86); issues of power and pow- er relationships within human societies and between human and non-human (Pike &amp; Selby, 2000); and parallels and links between inhumane treatment of animals and oppressive treatment of humans based on gender, race, and ethnicity (Selby, 1995, pp. 146- 150). The idea of community circle was instituted in which, at least once per week, parents and com- munity representatives were invited to join the class for circle discussion of issues flagged in advance in the class newsletter. At the start of the school year, the classes devised codes of student rights and responsibili- ties, subsequently employing a peer jury approach for dealing with any infringements. Following 2 months of research and discussions (during which parents, veterinarians, custodians, and representa- tives of humane organizations were invited to join the community circle), classes decided to adopt a pet in each classroom. Caring for the pet was guid- ed by a checklist inspired by the research under- taken by each class and developed through a cooperative decision-making process. In early winter the students took over the or- chestration and program of a parent-teacher asso- ciation evening on oppression of humans and non-humans. The teaching team reported that what had been considered "difficult" grade 6 classes evinced high levels of caring, maturity, and re- sponsibility, and that unsolicited concern for hu- man and non-human victims of cruelty and oppression were frequently voiced in community circle throughout the year. School ground naturalization Second school. In their unbridled enthusiasm, the schoolyard naturalization focus group, chaired by the school custodian, first surveyed students' views on schoolyard landscaping, had an expert draw up plans for wholesale naturalization, and galvanized widespread community support for the initiative, only to be confronted with opposition to the changes from the school board facility service. A more incremental approach was eventually agreed upon. When the first spring came, teachers, students, parents, and others joined in preparing the ground and planting on evenings and weekends. Additional parent involvement included one parent who con- ducted a preliminary survey of student use of and behaviors in the yard, another who raised money for plant purchases from local businesses, and another who found out about schoolground naturalization in other countries using the Internet. While such involvement was impressive, teacher members of the committee acknowledged a tardiness in involving students in the decision- making processes and in capitalizing on the cur- ricular opportunities afforded by the initiative. As the process unfolded, it was community members who were often at the leading edge of develop- ments in pushing for greater curricular pick-up and more student involvement, and for an extension of the group's work into campaigning for a chemical- free school, schoolyard, and school environs. Telecommunications Second school. The telecommunications focus group established an Internet link with a sister school in Makkovik, Labrador, the exchanges providing the stimulus for a grade 4 project on traditional and con- temporary Inuit culture and relationships with the land. The leading light of the group was a parent who devoted many hours to leading inservice work- shops and developing teachers' skills and confi- dence in using telecommunications in class. School plant Both schools. The school plant focus group in each school oversaw an expert environmental audit of the school and, after training from the technical experts, involved students of various grade levels in conducting their own energy, wa- ter, and waste audits and in using language, math, and science time to write reports or prepare exhi- bitions. Widespread dissemination of the findings led to sustained efforts to overturn a culture of unthinking wastefulness and energy consumption. As reported by the principal of the first school, staff members were "flabbergasted" by the find- ings and "only too ready to encourage saving." An unhappy sting in the tail in both cases was that the school board refused to allow resulting 93</page><page sequence="7">THEORY INTO PRACTICE / Spring 2000 GLOBAL EDUCATION / Viewed From Around the World financial savings to be plowed back into the school for further greening initiatives. Some resentment, and a sense that the work being undertaken was insufficiently valued among the higher echelons, resulted. A Greening of School Ethos As the focus groups gathered momentum in each of the two schools, it became important to put networking mechanisms in place to ensure a flow of information and ideas between groups, oth- er teaching and support staff, students, and the com- munity. Project newsboards were set up, focus group updates became regular items at staff meet- ings, and focus groups were encouraged to dis- seminate their news through a regular community newsletter. But perhaps the most important shar- ing device was the periodic lunch-time roundta- bles-open to all school staff and adult members of the community-in which progress and prob- lems on various fronts were reported and reviewed. Roundtables became a significant mobilizing strat- egy, helping to build greater coherence, shared understandings, and collaborative working relation- ships. Meetings between focus groups from each school and joint roundtables also took place, al- lowing for useful cross-fertilization of ideas. OGSP team members saw it as their primary function to help those involved discern complemen- tarities and potential synergies between the strands. As the multiple interconnections and intersections became clearer, collaboration began to happen. For instance, as the curriculum work of the grade 7 team in the first school became known, they were asked to advise grades 3 and 4 teaching teams in developing environmental/global curriculums for the next school year. At the same time, parental recognition of the curriculum potential of school ground naturalization eventually resulted in realizing that potential through native studies (growing indigenous foods) and sci- ence (study of seeds and grasses; fauna in the wild- life garden; photosynthesis). Nonetheless, optimizing the opportunities presented by a particular strand across all the other strands was not easy to achieve and required constant vigilance and encouragement by the OGSP team. Awareness of the difficulties of interweaving strands led to our recognizing that consideration of school ethos had a catalytic and all-pervasive part to play. It was not so much a strand as the ether of change. A shared understanding of direc- tions and visions would provide the medium through which the flow of change would permeate the interstices of school life. Impressively large cohorts of teachers, support staff, parents, and grade 7/8 students from both schools attended the project- wide day workshop on ethos. Participants were given the opportunity to reflect upon the principles that should inform learning and living in a green school and to identify ways in which those principles should become manifest in the daily workings of the school. It was, for many present, an awakening to new possi- bilities and meanings, and not least because of the articulate, perceptive, and challenging contributions of very earth-aware student representatives. For both schools the impact of the workshop was such that they decided to devote the bulk of staff meeting time in the next school year to im- proving levels of collaboration within the school community and to consensus-building around ethos. The payoff at the end of that year was significant. "The atmosphere has lightened up," declared the principal of the first school, having recounted her 7 years' experience of trying to break down teach- er individualism and the prevailing "behind close doors" learning and teaching culture of the school. Or, as the principal of the second school put it: "The atmosphere, the culture of the school, has changed, even though we've encountered many difficult challenges. ... I feel the teachers and students care more about the environment but they also care more about working together closely." The two schools' deliberations on ethos flowed into the OGSP School Ethos document, the outcome of ongoing discussions between the project team and all project schools (see Pike &amp; Selby, in press). The eight school ethos principles laid down in the document are as follows: * The school fosters learning and social environ- ments that promote equity, fairness, peace, and social and environmental justice. * The school commits to principles and processes of participatory democracy. * The school wholeheartedly embraces an ethic of environmental responsiveness. * The school values diversity while affirming com- monality. 94</page><page sequence="8">Selby A Darker Shade of Green * The school commits to educating for a fast-chang- ing, interconnected world. * The school fosters the inherent worth and dignity of each individual, positive interpersonal relation- ships, and environmentally, physically, and psy- chologically safe school environments. * The school promotes healthy lifestyles and rela- tionships. * The school values congruence between its principles and its practices. The concrete manifestations of each principle and the nature of school change processes derived from ecological principles will be the subject of a forth- coming book (Pike &amp; Selby, in press), while the learning activities devised under the project are described in a new two-volume work (Pike &amp; Selby, 1999, 2000). Conclusion One of the most effective ways to achieve [ecologi- cal literacy] is to transform our schools into collabo- rative learning communities-vibrant living systems that emulate the principles and values inherent in natural ecosystems.... A learning community is not so much a place as a process. . . . Schools have squelched diversity rather than accepting and honour- ing it. ... Schools have operated on principles that run counter to those inherent in ecological systems. (Cooper, 1993, p. 20) While, in its 3 brief years, the Ontario Green Schools Project was unable to completely trans- form the schools involved, school communities were galvanized behind a shared vision of the green school, and significant curricular and whole-school change did occur. Their experience provides im- portant pointers for both the nature and direction of ecologically-attuned school change. References Bateson, G. (1973). Steps to an ecology of mind. Lon- don: Granada.
