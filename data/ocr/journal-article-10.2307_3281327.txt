<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. Parasitol., 68(1), 1982, p. 83 ? American Society of Parasitologists 1982 BOOK REVIEW ... Foundations of Parasitology, Second Edition, by G. D. Schmidt and L. S. Roberts. C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis, Missouri. 1981. x + 795 p., 899 illustra- tions, soft cover. $22.95. The authors have published an attractive and use- ful book for the general student ofparasitology. The woodcut of a tapeworm on the cover from Andry (1718) is out of the past (the authors do not ignore history), but the book itself is a good attempt to update the text and possibly, more importantly, to place some of the human parasitic diseases in a so- cial context. The balance of the book is readily seen in the table of contents: (1) Introduction, 5 p., (2) Basic principles and concepts (including immunity), 25 p., (3) The Protozoa in eight chapters totaling 152 p., (4) Mesozoa, 8 p., (5) The Platyhelminthes in eleven chapters totaling 205 p., (6) The Nematoda in nine chapters totaling 129 p., (7) Phylum Acan- thocephala, 22 p., (8) Phylum Pentastomida, 8 p., (9) Phylum Arthropoda is treated in eight chapters, covering 118 p. A glossary and index finish the book. I find in both editions that the illustrations are a very strong attraction to the book. The photographs are generally well-done and of exceptional interest, but the method of reproduction or the paper quality leaves a good bit to be desired. The pen and ink drawings reproduced very well, however, and those taken from Schmidt's papers on the Acanthocephala are exceptional. The writing in the text is clear and easy to read, shading into the truly inspirational in some sec- tions. It is exciting reading to follow the deeds of daring do as parasitologists wrested from Nature Her secrets of transmission, epidemiology, pathol- ogy, etc. Read the short section (pp. 143-144) on Ross' work with malaria and feel his frustrations, his disappointments, and his final triumphs (Knighthood 1911 and Nobel Prize 1902). Study the section on Parasitology and Human Welfare (pp. 2-4) and suffer in empathy with those millions of humans harboring malaria, schistosomiasis, and try- panosomiasis in addition to their population-depen- dent malnutrition. Follow the life cycle of Fasciola and marvel how the young Thomas (age 23) equalled the greatest parasitologist of his time, Ru- dolph Leuckart, in their independant work on the liver fluke (pp. 299-300). Study the accounts of self- infection as parasitologists infected themselves and learned important information concerning the life cycles of certain parasites: (1) Looss, Ancylostoma duodenale, (p. 471) and (2) Calandruccio, Monili- formis moniliformis (p. 552). The new edition has added more pages to each section and the part on medical entomology is com- pletely new. The authors briefly introduce the "r" and "K" concepts of population ecology, but they fail to conjecture (or to give examples) how different species of parasites might be placed on this contin- uum of adaptative strategy. Also new to the book is a brief look at invertebrate "immunity." New also is Ch. 22, Tapeworms: Lesser lights, which consid- ers some of the tapeworms of less "importance." Some illustrations from the first edition have been deleted in the second edition and some illustrations from the first edition have been enlarged to good effect in the second edition. Color plates of eryth- rocytes infected with malaria have been added. There is at least one example of a lack of integra- tion. Extragenital insemination in tapeworms is called "hypodermic impregnation" whereas in the bedbugs the male "stabs" the female at the appro- priate extragenital site. And here the authors show a slight tendency toward the anthropomorphic in their enthusiastic description of the male bedbug's sexual activities. Incidently, the words bedbug and screw worm are both missing from the index. Some old errors are carried forward (Calde for Cable, p. 274) and new ones have been created (Lumsten for Lumsden, p. 340). The micrograph of tapeworm microvilli (microtriches, Fig. 20-10) is quite ordi- nary. Some will complain about the soft cover, others will object to the odd size of the book and many will comment on the quality of half tone reproduc- tion, but I will predict that we have here an out- standing example of bookmanscraft that in the fu- ture may well rival Chandler's effort in this regard. This book is highly recommended to those who need this kind of parasitology book. William H.
