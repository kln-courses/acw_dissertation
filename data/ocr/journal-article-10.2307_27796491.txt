<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM Anna Balakian Surr?alisme 1924-1974 The name of Andr? Breton is often equated with Surrealism either as its pope or its false architect. Shortly after his death in September 1966, I started seeking biographical facts and circumstantial data to build a frame around my study of his writings; to my surprise, the im pressions of witnesses added up to a portrait quite different from the synthetic one I had constructed on the basis of a continuous reading of his works. And suddenly I remembered a remark made by Proust in regard to character witnesses of Stendhal. Proust says: What difference does it make? In what way does the fact of having been a friend of Stendhal's make for a better judgment of him? The "I" that produces the works is covered up for his comrades by the other, which can be inferior to the exterior "I" of a lot of other people. ("Contre Sainte-Beuve") The interpersonal relations of Breton in his fifty years as writer and activist had created a tapestry of loves and hates, regrets and ven geances that had nothing much to do with the serene progression of his work as he evolved from young, rebellious medical student to ec static magus and on to philosopher and sage. But this progression was not so much discerned by his immediate entourage as by those who read him more than they saw him. Whereas many writers and artists stepped in and out of the surrealist movement in their lifetime, and whereas Breton remained the sustaining member of the coterie, the Surrealism he defined in his first Manifesto was not the one with which he ended his winters at the Rue Fontaine and his summers in Saint-Cirq la Popie. It is undeniable that Breton's first ascendance as a leader among his peers had a social rather than aesthetic basis for rebellion. But if as a social rebel he proceeded from the dream outward in Jungian fashion, almost immediately there occurred a crucial contradiction between his precepts and his subsequent behavior and writings. Early, he had severed his relations with Dada, which had violence as its basic emphasis. It is of course true that one of the most quoted sen JGE: THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION XXVII, 1 (Spring 1975). Published by The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park and London.</page><page sequence="2">70 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION tences from the manifestoes is "the simplest surrealist act is to go out in the street, revolver in hand, and shoot at random." But when the revolver is evoked to characterize the standard surrealist stance, the most important word in the statement is quickly passed over. The word "simplest" is very important because the statement, ap pearing in the Second Manifesto six years after the first, relates to a more intricate, revised notion of Surrealism that transcends the simple, negative act of protest. By that time, Breton had already given what he called "occultation" priority over overt, physical protest. He had also given ecstasy priority over catharsis as the principal objec tive of Surrealism. By 1930 he had also abandoned in his own poetry other tenets of Surrealism which he was proposing theoretically to his poet and artist disciples. Let us look for a few moments at what had happened to au tomatic writing and the cult of the irrational in his ensuing writings. Poisson soluble, which is the companion piece of the First Manifesto, is an extraordinary manuscript to behold. Written in the impeccable hand of Breton, apparently executed in total composure and without a sign of struggle, the poetic prose appears to flow from a pure and inexhaustible source. It is much more significant as a guideline to the development of Breton's poetics than Les Champs magn?tiques. It appears to be a truly automatic piece of writing, free from critical censorship on the part of the author and unburdened by any stylistic contrivances. It contains in disorganized fashion the whole future tapestry of Breton's imagery, culled as it were from both his mnemonic and oneiric resources: the fountain, the castle, the fish, the rose window, fire in all its manifestations, birds, stones, wood, ships, the lamp, the rain, a whole range of plants, crystal ob jects?these are the obsessive emblems that structure the young man's daily life in his quest for love and adventure through the streets of Paris; statues relay particular messages to him as they become alive with their ancient legends. The whole thing runs with bounce and at breakneck speed, and if he does not possess winged feet he has a five-leaf clover hanging over his shoulder. But when we come to the poetry of the 1930s it is an entirely dif ferent form of writing. The work is labored and the structure of the poems maneuvered as it is in the case of the later poems of Mallarm?. Words are crossed out and replaced several times over, whole lines redone. This is no longer standard automatic writing. It consists of present vision combined with memory's pool of pleasurable associa tions, voluntarily summoned and ?ssorted. Automatic writing called for juxtaposition and collage. But by the 1930s, at the height of his poetic powers, when Breton was between the ages of thirty and forty,</page><page sequence="3">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM 7 1 he had abandoned that element of early poetics and replaced it with a very conscious dislocation of the usual automatic relationship of images, managing a catalytic grouping of words to build his meta phors. This procedure is startlingly evident in L'Union libre. It is a synthesis of all the elements of convulsive beauty, cleverly and delib erately produced through a motive device of thrusting one image upon another in continuous movement. The prepositions "?" and "de" are the significant agents he uses, just like Mallarm?, to move images from one plane of vision to another, or from the scope of one sense-perception to another. There is no longer any trace of the fragmentation of Dada collage, but a process of alchemistic in tegration of the universe, the beginning of the metamorphosis mechanism that was to dominate his later writings. If Breton moved away from automatic writing, he also abandoned the cult of the irrational per se, which was an equally essential ingredient of early Surrealism. We have to look to Nadja to under stand how he came to grips with the irrational, and regretfully realized that his relationship with it would be a theoretical and learned one rather than an ontological one. Nadja marks a crucial moment in Breton's life: his confrontation with the irrational world, which he had previously extolled, and his rejection of it with some nostalgia but with irrevocable finality. He had boasted that one can never love any woman so completely as a demented one. The en counter with Nadja is the proof of the fallacy of his statement. Breton takes us into the electrically charged environment of the most exalted years of the surrealist c?nacle, and into this ambience he introduces the semi-deranged young woman whose face is half made-up, giving her a semi-rational semi-irrational appearance; her name is half the signification of the Russian word for "hope." Breton contracts with her a half-way alliance. When she is finally confined to a mental institution his indignation is a social one, not a personal sense of loss; he is no Orpheus lamenting the loss of his Eurydice. Nadja succeeded in unleashing his capacity for love but she was not its recipient, just as the cult of the irrational was a means and not an end in the search for the surrealist vision. Although every friend of Breton that I have been able to contact has vouched for the authenticity of Nadja as a real person?some of them had even dated her?I am convinced from the textual analysis of the dialogue between Breton and Nadja that the discourse of Nadja is too Bretonesque to be her actual, demotic speech. It is not even irrational; rather it becomes at one point alchemistic and shows to what extent Breton had already passed from the inspiration of automatism to that of hermeticism in the tradition of Nerval, Rimbaud and Mallarm?. I am compelled to think that the</page><page sequence="4">72 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION vision Nadja is supposed to have had of a hand burning in the Seine river was gifted to her by her poet-lover: "That hand, that hand in the Seine, why that hand aflame in the water?" she allegedly asked. In a poem, "Sur la Route qui monte et descend," Breton put prac tically the same words in his own mouth: "Flamme d'eau guide-moi jusqu'? la mer de feu." As for the blue wind she saw passing in the trees, it strangely con tains the dislocation pattern of poetic imagery that Breton was devel oping at that period. Nadja was indeed herself the blue wind that passed through Breton's life and never returned again as he proceeded to other materials with which to build his surrealist world. Thereafter, the irrational is much more dominant in the paintings of Dal? and Magritte than in Breton's poetry. In the following two volumes of his trilogy, Les Vases com municants and L'Amour fou, he was to test the viability of the other two characteristics that he had earlier identified as canons of Surreal ism: the utilization of the dream and the exploitation of objective chance. In Les Vases communicants the dream is analyzed theoreti cally and in terms of his personal life. The point to be noted is that the dream is never considered as a nightmare; it is always pleasantly intentioned and benign in its fulfillment. It is not a refuge from life?as it was in Romantic and Symbolist poetics?but deeply in volved in energizing reality. However, we must observe that in Breton's writings the dream assumes thereafter less and less impor tance than the waking time and fails to be the fountainhead of poetry, which it had been for the German nocturnal poets in whom Breton admired the cult of the dream in his youth. He left the whole area of dream transcription to other surrealists who successfully explored the realm of the nightmare pictorially and verbally. In the third volume, L'Amour fou, Breton became involved in another of the processes which from his early youth he thought relevant to Surrealism: to effect the coincidences between objective chance and human necessity. He put his hypothesis to a crucial test in L'Amour fou. He tried to make the dream-wish of a new love come alive by making himself avail able to the objective course of events. Although his previous walks in Paris in the company of his friends were aleatory, in L'Amour fou they are consciously programmed, and the visions and excitement they provide are carefully recorded. The gratuitous movements have nongratuitous motivations: in the search for love, Breton follows the archetypal pattern of the Roman de la rose (the Guillaume de Lorris version), the quest for the "one and only." And, in the end, the journey proves successful. In fact, what might have been otherwise</page><page sequence="5">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM 73 viewed as the account of a series of pick-ups of fair ladies becomes a metaphysical quest regulated by the laws of probability. Let it be ob served that Breton is not merely subjected to these laws but is con sciously manipulating them. Whereas in the poetic writings of the 1930s and 1940s the practice of automatic writing together with the exploration of the irrational and the dream fall into less important positions, the pursuit of the laws of prob ability remains a source of fascination for Andr? Breton and an impor tant part of the basic mechanism of poetic inspiration: "je chante la lumi?re unique de la coincidence," he says in L'Air de l'eau. The whole anatomy of love, which is the basic resource of his poetry, is the product of chance and necessity. From this uncertainty and unpredictability it derives all its mystery, its excitement, and its state of grace. It is obvious that Breton shifted priorities in his concept of Surreal ism as he progressed through his own career. We do not find him repeating mechanically the same old devices: the nonsense images, the wild dreams, the irrational behaviors, in sum, all the activities which made Surrealism come to mean "the fantastic," i.e., the exact op posite of what Breton had in mind. Some of the reasons he gave in the Second Manifesto for excom municating members of the surrealist group seem, in the long view, to have been rationalizations rather than real reasons. The fact is that until the end of his life the surrealist Desnos continued to cultivate dream images and automatic and hypnotic writing; the fact is that Sal vador Dal? and Antonin Artaud continued to exploit their natural ir rationality; the fact is that the group which separated itself from Breton to form Le Grand Jeu did so to continue the violent action-politics that Breton had favored but had not sufficiently substantiated. It is these early surrealist comrades who continued the initial pattern of surrealist doctrine, whereas Breton proceeded to a more intricate and perhaps less circumstantial form of Surrealism. Not automatism, not the obsessive cult of the dream, not the ir rational use of language for the sake of its irrationality, but the process of alchemy is what continued to excite Breton throughout his life and to kindle his poetic vision. The alchemy of love and language, the mys teries of coincidences, the conciliation of opposites are the elements that prevailed in his writings and life attitudes: a Naturalistic her meticism from which the supernatural factors were deleted. As far back as Poisson soluble, the hermetic signs were already there. He wrote under the aegis of Proteus or the Chameleon, and the refer ences to the Great Work and to cabalistic and hieroglyphic emblems were numerous. The last image was one of a blindfolded man carrying</page><page sequence="6">74 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION the key to the mystery of life. One of the most revelatory guidelines to Breton's writing is his choice of titles. Their meaning is not in the context of violence or the irrational, not even of automatism or the dream, but in that of her meticism and its mythology. In two of his titles, Clair de terre and UAir de Veau, we have the four elements of the alchemistic uni verse: earth, fire, air, and water. Another title suggests the mystique of signs as they are immanent in the universe: Fata Morgana where mythology and physical phenomenon coincide as he tries to read his destiny in the phantom figures created by the mist on the Mediterra nean horizon. He talks in hermetic riddles instead of lamenting his state of exile after the fall of France in 1940. A little later he writes the book of exile in America, to which he gives again a hermetic title, Arcane 17, with specific allusions to the Tarot cards. La Cl? des champs, the title of his last collection of essays, not counting the post humous one, has also a hermetic character, representing the same key to liberty as in Poisson soluble. And his last series of poems, Con stellations, represents his spiritual horoscope. You may have noticed that in my enumeration I left out one collec tion of poems, Le Revolver a cheveux blancs. For years I considered it the perfect example of automatic writing, of the juxtaposition of unrelated realities, creating a spontaneous and irrational image. But when I observed how often Breton referred to Fulcanelli's Les Demeures philosophales, I began to read this book on the alchemy of the fourteenth century. To my amazement, I discovered that the image is not irrational but emblematic. The "cheveux blancs" is a reference to the White Work, which in the alchemists' language rep resents the work of youth, imperfect but more available than the later stages of the Great Work. The emblem of the White Work was the crescent moon, and its light was likened in its shimmering effect to white hair: "cheveux blancs." If "revolver" suggests the simple surrealist act of being "shooting mad," referred to in the Second Manifesto, then Le Revolver a cheveux blancs is a remarkable junc tion of meanings?protest and youth, the protest of youth?and also indicative of a milestone in his life: the passage from rebellion to rev elation. But there is much more than hermetic titles in the alchemy that guides Breton. If in the First Manifesto he refers to Pierre Reverdy's definition of the poetic image as the process of bringing together distant realities, the pattern he himself adopts is the one in herent in the alchemical analogy. It is the rebus, the notion that each image contains in itself many other images. This metaphoric structure is supposed to reflect the universal structure of "one in the other,"</page><page sequence="7">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM 75 if l\ Lawrence von Barann Homage to Andr? Breton?The Hierophant</page><page sequence="8">76 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION the concept of nature's metamorphoses. That, in fact, is the modus operandi of Breton's poetics: universal analogies not connected with any transcending superstructure, but circulating in a monistic biosphere where everything is in constant state of becoming, and ev eryone and everything complements and completes everything else. It is not a graduated ladder, as in the intentioned universe of Kant and Swedenborg, but a great circuit of total interrelationships. To be a poet is not to hear the overtones or messages from beyond, or to sense superforms, but to find one form in another in nature and one meaning in another in language, on a purely empirical basis. Nature and language are the self-contained universe of man; in them he can identify himself in many guises and through them he can expand his capacity to see and to communicate what he has seen. Man becomes through vision. The alchemistic analogy in fact becomes the genetic code of Breton's poetry. The poetic analogy of the Romanticists was structured on antithesis and that of the Symbolists on parallels. But that of Breton is based on conciliations and fusions, that is, on the implementation of the occult doctrine of la coincidentia oppositorium. That is why Breton's pleas urable attitudes toward the physical world and toward love are so closely interrelated; they are both manifestations of the embrace, in which there is no dichotomy between the sensual and the affective because they merge in the true and integral sense of the surreal. Even as the interdependence of the butterfly and acacia plant, so that of man and woman. The image is obsessive, ecstatic, omnipotent. In Breton's poetics, nature does not assume human feelings as in the case of poets involved in what has come to mean "the poetic fallacy," but rather embraces human forms; the universe is no longer anthropocentric, but it does not lose its anthropomorphic func tioning because, after all, man has made the physical world his own and has given it his own purpose and the concept of beauty which exists nowhere else in the biosphere except in man's mind and eye. Whereas Alain Robbe-Grillet observes the transparence of things as an indica tion of their lack of meaning, Breton aspired to the transparence as a source of illumination. As he interrogated things, stones, sunlight, water, birds, he gave them polysemantic meaning, and extracted the "poetic intelligence of the universe," that intelligence not deemed to be inherent to that universe but a human quality projected upon it. A masterly example of this process can be found in Arcane 17 when he contemplated the geological phenomenon of the Perc? Rock at the tip of the Gasp? peninsula and transformed it with his own power of analogy into various visions, contained one in the other, and all objec tifications of his own thoughts and desires. The Rock becomes an em</page><page sequence="9">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM 77 blem by means of which Breton can build analogies between cosmic and human modifications. Breton's analogical eye, with its habit of seeing one thing in another, equates or merges the hues of the rock, rose to deep purple, with the soldering of human cultures in human blood. The analogy of disintegration and division that the rock spells out in its stratification on the one hand is compensated by the image of unity and cohesion that the solid appearance of the rock conveys; so does he see, in spite of Europe's fragmentation, the unity and oneness of humankind: "Substratum complex and indivisible." Most of the surrealists of the 1920s were committed to political positions by the time World War II occurred. They wrote partisan essays and circumstantial poetry. Breton confined his moral and social indictments of World War II to expository prose, but in his long poems of that period he transformed the circumstances of his stress into the broader analogies of myths which he recycled for his own intentions. The poem of Marseilles, where he fled as a refugee from occupied France, the poems of the new world, where he remained in self-exile for five years, are metaphorical and analogical, and the myths he borrowed, such as those of the black god, Osiris, together with the angels of liberty and mercy such as Isis, Melusine, and Esclarmonde, are emblematic of man's regeneration rather than of his degredation. He casts them in a poetic structure very tightly and consciously woven. The architecture of these long poems and the prose poems, Constellations, is reminiscent of that of the poems of Mallarm?'s last period. If they are obscure, it is not because they are clusters of irrationally connected images; they are obscure because of the deli cate interinvolvement of images and because of a poetic language set free of the strictures of accepted connotations. If Breton started his career as a writer in the context of social rebellion and iconoclasm, in his later years he joined the massive hermetic tradition in which are lodged so many of the world's great poets: Shakespeare, Blake, Goethe, Novalis, Mallarm?, Yeats, and now Breton. He used the common pool of occult emblems to express his own unique vision of the universe. The archetype with which he identified best in the end was that of Theseus and the labyrinth. Now it is obvious that the labyrinth has become one of the most pervasive and internationally frequent em blems in modern literature. But Br?ton's use of the metaphor of the maze is not the standard one. In contemporary literature the forest, the castle, the interlocked streets, the airtight room, are often varia tions of the labyrinth syndrome; they betray man's sense of confine ment, both in terms of his interior world and of the outer reality; they</page><page sequence="10">78 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION convey man's acceptance of the fact that he will never, never be able to emerge from his trapped condition. But in Breton's writings the labyrinth is the foil of man's triumph. He has a firm hold on the string that will get him out of it. "Man will come out of the laby rinth," he says in Entretiens. II In trying to determine Surrealism's heritage, if we look toward the more obvious and earliest manifestations of its tenets, we will come to associate Surrealism with preposterous and masochistic word play, expansion of consciousness through the cult of a stylized insanity, and the reconstructed nightmare instigated by drug trips. But the subconscious is old hat, and if Breton's claim to immor tality were to be based on the fact that he was one of the first to have capitalized on Freudian analysis in the literary context, his achieve ments would certainly fall into the historical period-classification of Joyce or Proust. As for the expression of the essentially incoherent, the heritage of Dada can make better claims on it and achieves it with more humor. The truth of the matter is that, in the Anglo-American context of the word, when a work is called surrealist today it is really closer to lat terday Dada. Surrealism, as it evolved in Breton's work, survives through two basic channels. The liberating power of language as a universal human prospect and as a channel for awareness of a liber ated self is one of them. The other is the establishment of a new rela tionship with nature: not the complicity of the long prevailing Romantic attitude, which now is considered a "pathetic fallacy," nor the total dissociation of the human self from a dehumanized cosmos, which is the domain of the literature of the absurd. Rather, this new rapport is the result of the cultivation, not of corre spondences, not of the metaphor or standard analogy, but of me tonymical substitution which comprehends the convulsive process of the universe and man's spontaneous participation in it. These characteristics, which have not had much impact on recent European or Anglo-American writings, are the bases of the attraction of Surrealism for the developing countries, which find themselves marginal or even antithetical to the European traditions. Francophone poets of non-French racial make-up were drawn to Breton's practice of surrealist language as he tried to liberate him self, sometimes successfully, sometimes incompletely, from the shackles of inbred connotations. To be able to use language without having to carry the weight of its conventions suited their purposes</page><page sequence="11">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM 79 ideally. So startling was the success of Aim? C?saire in accomplishing this feat that when Breton discovered him and his version of surrealist poetry he called it pure oxygen. "C'est la cuve humaine port?e ? son point de plus grand bouillonnement." he said, and again: Et c'est un noir qui manie la langue fran?aise comme il n'est pas un blanc pour la manier. Et c'est un noir celui qui nous guide aujourd'hui dans l'inexplor?, ?tablissant au fur et ? mesure, comme en se jouant, les contacts qui nous font avancer sur des ?tincelles. (Hemispheres, p. 7) The same power of linguistic liberation occurred in the case of the Latin American poets who looked to Breton to give them the signal for linguistic license. The Chilean Vicente Huidobro, who had been a companion of Pierre Reverdy and had then been in the same revolu tionary ambience as Breton, had, in fact, written his own avant-garde manifesto a few months before Breton's. He had already declared the role of language in its creative rather than communicative capaci ty. Some years later, in 1939, he denigrated the Spanish stylists in an interview as Breton had attacked the French ones in L?gitime D?fense. He saw Spanish literature as "aplastada por la retorica, esa terrible ret?rica del Mediterr?neo que mantiene ahogados bajo su l?pida a todos los escritores de Espa?a, de Italia y muchos de Francia." (Reprinted in Orfeo, no. 13-14.) In his bid for a more vigorous, creative use of language he dared to criticize such literary saints as Garcia Lorca and Ortega y Gasset. When one considers the literary future of Surrealism in Latin American poetry as opposed to the peninsular, one can observe a significant disparity. The Spanish, like the French, take to the revolver, shooting at the image of the cor rupted modern European; they practice the Marquis de Sade method of social censure, which is indubitably part of the surrealist posture. But the Breton who evolved after the manifestoes was one who emphasized love, supreme and propitious coincidences, occultation, the monistic vision of existence; this face of Surrealism did not thrive in the sophisticated and rationally conditioned climate of Europe. But it took with electrifying power in the poetry of Africa, the West Indies, Mexico, in South American writing in general. Breton's modest efforts to utilize Celtic legend and the frame of reference of medieval alchemists found fresh and fecund repercussions in the resources of Indian and African myths resplendently representative of an animistic view of nature. For instance, in C?saire's Et Les Chiens se taisaint, the protago nist of the poetic drama, Le Rebelle, warding off the colonizers, at</page><page sequence="12">80 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION tributes to his speech the power of fire ("ma parole a puissance de feu," p. 46), and stands his ground on the "convulsive soil" where every tuft hides a god; he deplores the fact that the destructive powers of the colonizers had dried up the perfume of the mandragora, that natural plant which contains the magical fusion of human shape and vegetable composition. In fact, the mandragora becomes for the developing countries the signet of their association with Surrealism: a reality yielding the earth's natural power of magical form and func tion, which is the way these poets of the new countries understood Andr? Breton's Surrealism. The mandragora is of the same family of surrealist emblems as the minotaur of European Surrealism; it saluted Breton from Martinique as it hailed him from Chile, where it became the title of its most important surrealist journal and the name of a surrealist press under the direction of Braulio Arenas. To come back to the magical powers manifest in nature and cul tivated by the probing poet, we find Leopold Senghor hailing with barbaric accent, in the language of his conquerors, the surrealist char acter of his land: "au soleil-levant, sur le supr?me pic, la t?te du Lion rouge en sa majest? surr?elle." ("Nocturne," Po?mes, Editions du Seuil, Paris, 1964; p. 195.) The Mexican poet Octavio Paz, also belonging to the magus sector of Surrealism, was to explore the Mexican cults that substantiated Breton's approach to nature. In Piedra de sol, for instance, we find the alchemistic signification of the elements of fire, earth, air, water, and through them he conveys his inviolate sense of the totality of life in the solidarity of all existence. Like Breton he forges ahead in the labyrinth and strives for transparence in crystal, in phosphorescence, and looks for the sacred in signs and numbers. Like Breton, his objec tive is to create exaltation and to provoke vision and vertigo. Then there are those extraordinary Argentinian poets Enrique Molina, Aldo Pellegrini, and Vicente Zito Lema, who establish a new metaphysics of poetry. Molina, who writes his own L'Union libre in the form of a Carta de amor, declares that he recognizes no race save the violet and the green, which can describe water and fire: La raza blanca, La raza negra La raza roja la raza amarilla: Yo s?lo conozco la raza violeta y la raza verde y la raza de tu lengua que descifra el agua y el fuego ("Sentar cabeza," Amantes ant?podas, Buenos Aires, 1961 ; p. 51.) He tries to lift the masks of the sun and endows walls with wings, and conjugates the light of his dreams with that of the clouds in pursuit of nature's alchemy. Aldo Pellegrini, who like Breton had medical training and in fact practiced medicine, and whose bookstore, El</page><page sequence="13">THE PROGRESS OF SURREALISM 81 drag?n, is the gathering place of Argentinian surrealists, transgresses with his majestic free verse the territory reserved for gods; passing through a diaphanous labyrinth he cultivates the chaos of the uni verse. The youngest of these three Argentinians, Vicente Zito Lema, who reads Breton as one reads the Bible, searches for the gods of the rivers; he identifies the penetration of reality with that of a love union, and catches the heart of the mountain in a cage of crystal. The remarkable power of the Peruvian biligual C?sar Moro conveys some of the enchantment of Julian Gracq, but his delirious ecstasy is benign, and he burns the walls of space instead of de stroying the bodies of humans. In fact, not brutality but love became the "signe ascendant" of Surrealism in Latin America as RSVPs were answered to Breton's invitation for the "Union libre" of love. The male-female princi ple was widened, as in the case of Breton, to include the threads of conjunction in the totality of the natural and madly seductive laby rinth. "Hilos" is one of the most frequent words in this poetry, "crystal" sustaining Breton's search for purity, and phospho rescence prolonging indefinitely the luminosity of Breton's vision. The Chilean poets, above all, preserve and nurture the most potent ingredients of Surrealism today. The convulsive character of their land has perhaps something to do with it; or perhaps it is the melting pot character of their national origin which makes of them truly citi zens of the planet, as Breton dreamed that man might someday become. Chile's constantly moving sand and sea became a natural springboard for the surge of immanent beauty and the provocation of a precarious delirium. The sense of risk and danger is ever present in this poetry, as in this land, as well as the vertigo of fervor. As that magnificent poet G?mez-Correa says: "Toda embriaguez no es m?s que una sucesiva reuni?n de v?rtigos." Interpreter of the language of silent beings, he treads the frontiers of the infinite and speaks with the stars, and experiences transfigurations not in anguish but in joy. Another resourceful, diverse, and exciting Chilian poet is Ludwig Zeller. Both Zeller and G?mez-Correa took up Breton's interest in madness, and both have done serious investigations into that state, not in playful simulation but from the point of view of its effects on lan guage and vision. Zeller's most recent poem, Woman in Dream, is a majestic synthesis of the enduring qualities of Surrealism in the cult of the erotic and the varying tempos of dream-time and clock-time. For these Chileans the line between the real and the surreal is oblit erated, as they seem possessed of that state of grace which Breton defined in which the real becomes the surreal. In a letter to his poet friend Rosamel del Valle, surrealist Diaz-Casanueva confirms their</page><page sequence="14">82 THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION mutual love of the light of reality. It is a reality to which they have both added a light of high surrealist voltage. The sense of ignited matter was indeed much closer to young civili zations than to aging ones. Surrealism in its quest for the natural magic of the earth infused poetry with vitality and exaltation rather than with the wry humor it provoked in the European context. The cult of the dream for them was not the remembered nightmare or the effusive beauty lost with a lost Golden Age, but the possibility of implementation of the dream as prophesy. Breton's "Facteur Cheval" is a frequent reference supporting their belief in the real ization of dreams. Closer to the moving forces of the natural world, the Latin Ameri cans caught the spark and with it opted for the shining side of the moon rather than the dark, with promise of a future golden age for mankind. Temporary setbacks on the political front are not likely to mute a free language; for the poets of Spanish-speaking America have learned to make full use of the permissiveness of Spanish word order to break traditional alliances of words and to take risks. A liberated language points the way to other liberations and, perhaps, to a greater likelihood that Breton's effort to emerge from the labyrinth of superannuated strictures was not a pipe dream after all. For Breton the architecture of a poem and the maneuvers of an ex cursion in the countryside of St. Cirq la Popie had been similar en deavors; both contained a search pattern, emblematic of a march through a labyrinth and the capture of the philosophers' stone. For Breton the philosophers' stone meant time and light. In one of his last essays, which he called La Lampe dans l'Horloge, he crys tallized that concept for all time. We have to go again to Fulcanelli for its original reference. At the foot of the tomb of Fran?ois I er in the Cathedral of Nantes there is a statue of a figure in whose hand there is a clock with a lantern inside it. Fulcanelli points out that the meaning of lantern completes that of clock. In fact, if the lantern illu minates because it contains light, the clock appears as the dispenser of that light, which is not received in one flash but little by little with the aid of time. "Time, sole master of wisdom," is the inscription. The slow dissemination and the deplorable misunderstanding of Breton's work at home and in some foreign countries indicate that the clock has been marking time slowly and that the lamp in the clock has not had the chance to illuminate at its full capacity as we mark the first fifty years since the First Manifesto. This fact would not have been cause for great dismay to Breton, since he wanted the poet to start his writing always with the expression: "Il y aura une fois."</page></plain_text>
