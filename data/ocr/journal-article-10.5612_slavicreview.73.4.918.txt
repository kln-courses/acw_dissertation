<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 918 Slavic Review State, Faith, and Nation in Ottoman and Post-Ottoman Lands. By Frederick F.  Anscombe. Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 2014. xix, 323 pp.  Notes. Bibliography. Index. Photographs. Maps. $30.99, paper. Challenging “standard assumptions” (3) about the ways in which the Ottoman em- pire transitioned into nation-states, Frederick Anscombe’s readable account of politi- cal elites misusing state power to undermine society posits that religion (especially  “Islamic political identity” [4]), and not ethnonationalism, was the transformative  historical force in the modern Balkans and Middle East. Unfortunately, over eleven  chapters dedicated to regions (and then individual countries) in the throes of change  over three distinctive periods—“The Ottoman Empire” (part 1), “From Ottoman to  Post-Ottoman State” (part 2), and “Contemporary Post-Ottoman States” (part 3)— Anscombe needlessly undermines his observations by failing to fully acknowledge  the contributions of his peers. For one, Anscombe’s “replacement narrative” (11) is an elaboration on Kemal Kar- pat’s and George Gawrych’s normative “Islam” that informed their depictions of late  Ottoman society. Worse, such claims that Islam (or religion more generally) was the  anchor for society in these critical transitional periods appears deaf to the concerns  voiced by Talal Asad and others. Questions about there ever being a uniformly prac- ticed, let alone experienced, Islam to service historical narratives about the modern  era have been repeated by Brian Silverstein, John J. Curry, Nathalie Clayer, and Sean  Foley, whose work on Ottoman and post-Ottoman Sufi sm also challenges claims that  a monolithic “Muslim” polity confronted the modernizing state. Their work, unac- knowledged in this book, demonstrated that what demarcated a Muslim polity before  World War II necessarily included Sufi  orders that had long infi ltrated circles of power  to the extent that there could not be a uniformly iterated “Sunni” ethos, as Anscombe  claims. Beyond this, Anscombe’s assertion that he is writing against a “standard”  storyline preaching “nationalism” or “sectarianism” as the engine of change in the  Ottoman world ignores a whole generation of scholars. Recent work by Jens Hans- sen, Christopher Clay, George Gavrilis, Avi Rubin, Judith Tucker, Robert Zens, M. Safa  Saraçoğlu, Michelle Campos, and Ussama S. Makdisi (none of whom are cited) point  to a diverse set of actors whose decidedly non-sectarian, ethnically hybrid associa- tions undermine any linear accounting for changes taking place. As such, the working model of fi xed religious mores as the driving historical force  that ultimately resurfaces once modern “secular” regimes collapse in the 1990s (ad- dressed in part 3) proves a distraction from Anscombe’s otherwise valuable observa- tions about the struggles for political ascendency in the post-Ottoman era. In this re- gard, readers may object to Anscombe’s use of an anthropomorphic “state,” which he  juxtaposes to an equally monolithic post-Ottoman Balkan and Middle Eastern “soci- ety.” The consequences are assertions that dynamic polities like Yugoslavia, for one,  constituted an “atheistic . . . state” (230) that uniformly suppressed religion until Josip  Broz Tito’s death. To the contrary, Belgrade’s political elite actually invested consid- erable resources to harness “Islam” through the Sarajevo-based Islamska zajednica  (Islamic Community) to help subjugate hitherto autonomous non-Slav communities  in Kosovo and Macedonia. Anscombe continues to disappoint by misrepresenting eastern bloc regimes as  politically frozen prior to 1989. Readers will certainly recall those dramatic putsches  throughout eastern Europe aft er 1956 and the fall of Aleksandar Ranković in 1966,  neither of which Anscombe mentions when interpreting the Tito era. Even Albania’s  regime is misrepresented as a rigid monolith, disregarding the internal rift s that  led to the country’s reorientations, fi rst from Belgrade to Moscow in 1948, the pe- riod of staunch Stalinism aft er 1956 that resulted in purges within communist par- </page> <page sequence="2"> Book Reviews 919 ties throughout the world, and then Tirana’s short-lived alliance with Beijing in the  1960s. Still, as much as Anscombe’s larger accounting for “what happened” over the last  two hundred fi ft y years is both methodologically outdated and needlessly partisan,  this book off ers valuable insights into a complicated transitional period in modern  history. Indeed, the author’s most interesting insights focus on the fi rst iterations of  “sickly” (141) post-Ottoman states’ transitions from “traditional” governing practices  to a period of modern state-building policies aimed at subordinating supralocal (re- ligious) identities. Perhaps because he actually accesses primary sources and then  generously cites the larger scholarship while analyzing the period of Mahmud II’s  reign (1807–38) in part 1 and those early post-Ottoman Serbian and Greek regimes in  the nineteenth century in part 2, these exemplary cases best highlight Anscombe’s  skills as an historian. As such, his conjectures about the failings of modern regimes  in the Balkans and Middle East, along with his prose, which is always lucid and en- gaging, ultimately make this book a welcome instrument for professors needing an  introductory text covering these periods.

Illustra- tions. Photographs. Tables. €34.90, hard bound. Urban history as a distinct fi eld within east European studies has produced some im- portant works over the past couple of decades. Besides the endless titles on such highly  atmospheric locales as Budapest, Prague, and Vienna, there have also been important  works on “secondary cities” such as Wrocław (Breslau), Thessaloniki (Salonica, or  Selânik), and others, including Sarajevo. The book under review, by a famous scholar  of Balkan history, makes an important contribution to this literature and is, in fact,  part of a series dedicated to the smaller cities of eastern Europe (eine kleine Stadtge- schichten aus dem Östlichen Europa). In a lively voice that is at once erudite and con- versational, Holm Sundhaussen portrays Sarajevo as a cosmopolitan and multiethnic  space, while refusing to ignore that such spaces are oft en noteworthy at least as much  as testaments to coexistence as they are testimonials to the worst atrocities in human  history. Sarajevo’s history certainly provides plenty of examples of both. Sarajevo is something of a purpose-built capital. When the Ottomans completed  their conquest of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1463, the new governor established himself  in the small town of Vrhbosna. His palace (saray, in Turkish) soon gave the growing  city its new name. Despite, or perhaps because of, its status as an imperial adminis- trative center, Sarajevo very quickly attained a cosmopolitan personality. The chap- ters on the growth of Ottoman Sarajevo, and indeed on Ottoman Sarajevo in general,  are among the strongest in this generally excellent book. Particularly interesting is  Sundhaussen’s nuanced and careful treatment of the concepts of coexistence, tol- erance, and identity among the peoples of Ottoman Bosnia. Along similar lines, he  stresses the malleable and overlapping nature of Bosnian, and especially Sarajevan,  identities. While never downplaying the tensions between the diff erent confessional  and ethnic groups, Sundhaussen contends that outright intercommunal violence in  Ottoman Sarajevo was rare, unless introduced from outside. Perhaps the most fatal  of all these exogenous infl uences was the infi ltration of nationalist ideas during the  nineteenth century. </page> </plain_text>
