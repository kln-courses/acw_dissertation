<plain_text><page sequence="1">2 Christmas: An American Paradox by John Cramer HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1 Christmas: An American Paradox by John Cramer</page><page sequence="2">3 This is a speculative investigation of an extremely complex so cial phenomenon, Christmas. It asks why the t-aditional Incarnation feast has been overwhelmed by intensecommerc"3! cooptation and ec onomic rationalization. In pursuit ofsome of the roots of this institu tionalized activity an effort is made to grasp He place of ecbnomic surplus (those goods left over after basic subsistence needs have been cared for) in human society. Religious control and direction of sur plus, sacredly interpreted, produced a complex of ethical postulates aimed at development of restraints on practices considered as self aggrandizing in a material way. Pre-Christian end Christian practices up to the Reformation seem to be as one on this issue. The Reforma tion and movements which arose in conjunction with it seem to have revised this ancient system of material restraint. Modern Christmas appears to be a manifestation of a new complex of attitudes regarding use of economic surplus. Gift-giving is central and conjecturally considered as a phenomenon which reveals some of the meaning of this national period of festivity; festivity aimed at ho-xjring the productive ness of the American economic system. There is also an attempt made to judge the power of the 'work ethic' as a furcamentalconstruct in volved in the processes of the American culture's magnification of Christmas as its greatest moment of prodigal exuberance.

But this state of incertitude and confused agitation cannot last forever. A day will come when our societies will know again those hours of creative effervescence, in the course of which new ideas arise and new formulae are found which serve for a while as a guide to humanity; and when these hours shall have been passed through once, men will spontaneously feel the need of reliving them from time to time in thought, that is to say, of celebrations which regularly reproduce their fruits." Emile Durkheim The Elementary Formsofthe Religious Life HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 5:1</page><page sequence="4">5 Effusive giving is the most notable characteristic of Christmas, U.S.A. Effusive giving isalsoa most singular characteristic in tradi tional sacrificial religious practices. Christmas is in its origins a re ligious feast. It symbolizes the birthday of the one whose name iden tifies the beginnings of a gigantic religious movement and is repre sented by a cluster of on-going churches with elaborate theologies liturgies, and traditions. However, to maintain that today Christmas in the United States is predominantly a sacred feast of traditional con tent, religiously speaking, offends one's intelligence and grasp of re ality. That Christmas was once a great feast of Christian interpreta tion representing religious dominance and influence is clear enough and readily admitted. Yet, it is not absurd to maintain that today Christmas is a religious feast; the question is: if it is not a traditional religious feast, what kind is it? Simple observation assures us that giving is thecentral ingredient in the American interpretation of Christmas. We are only too aware of the time, money, and reflection which mil lions of Americans devote to the annual ritual of gift giving. Few of us can remain oblivious to the mounds of goods assembled by merchants from the world's corners to entice the spendthrift gift-seeker. One and all are deeply aware of the incessantly garish lights, street decorations, window displays, wrapping papers and ribbons, special bottles and packages, and the general carnival or sideshow atmosphere surrounding the commer cial areasof cities and suburbs. Each merchandising emporium attempts to out-do its competitors in developing ingenious ways of attracting customers. Christmas is certainly commercial. Christmas involves extraordinary activity. Christmas certainly involves the purchase of goods which are unnecessary. And, Christmas is a self-punishing activity for seller and buyer, for giver and sender, and, at the same time represents the periodof greatest commercial activity in the entire calendar year. What does it all mean? From immemorial times religions have been directly involved In the manner in which a community developed, identified and used ec HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="5">6 onomic surplus (Frankfort et at., 1946:185). Egyptian temples and pyramids, Babylonian zuggurats, Greek temples, Roman basilicas, and medieval cathedrals all and each attests to the concentration of wealth by a community (Eliade, 1963:367-8). This concentration, apparently a public acknowledgement of guilt, is an admission that violations of agod's law bya peoplemustbe publicly expiated. Peo ple admitted their individual and collective sinfulness by gathering together their hard won worldly goods and by raising a visable struc ture which acknowledged the divinity's dominance. In so doing each confessed his personal guilt and publicly recognized the community's collective guilt in its inability to adhere strictly to a divine scheme for the world (Otto, 1958:50-57, 65-66). Recognition of the sacred was a major preoccupation of man. Any thing above the minimum necessary for subsistence was commandeered and accumulated for sacred display. The motivation for this was any thing but economic. As Thorkild Jacobsens says,". . .since man was created especially for the benefit of the gods, his purpose is to serve the gods. Therefore no human institution can have its primary aim in the welfare of its own members; it must seek primarily the welfare of the gods (1946:185),11 A basic assumption of ancient people was that the earth was but God's estate, a sacred manor, which he governed on behalf of Him self. Everyone was involved in carrying out the commands of the 'owner.' In some places, such as Egypt, there was a god (pharoah) in charge whodirectly managed on behalf of the great god who bridged earth and heaven personally. The divine influence was immediate and dominant (Frankfort et at., 1946:71-86). On another level of involvement it appears that the excess of at least a portion of one's personal goods was sacrificial on behalf of one's imperfection. The fact that this was performed without consciousness of the act's implication is irrelevant. Hundreds and thousands of small gifts amounted to a grand accumulation of penitential material. The HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="6">7 aggregated material was collectively administered by priests on be half of the community. It was put in the form of an offering. The offering itself varied in form. Frequently it was a building set aside for sac red ceremonies. It was at times an altar or some unusual decora tion such as asculpted figureofa goddess, a mosaic of a sacred being, or, agarmentof extraordinary cloth and workmanship foruse in a sacred ceremony. In the process somehow aesthetics and religion were recip rocally related. Art appeared to dynamically organize the communal product in order to reflect the community's considerable commitment to its gods back through its own consciousness. Awareness, taste, and priorities were expressed inc lusively by the artists working the materials on behalf of religion (van der Leeuw, 1963:195-210). Simultaneously, economic self-aggrandizement was manipulated and certified as a minor value. The economy was not ego centered; it was a subordinate device for the realization of community and re ligious goals. The important need of the community was to publicly demonstrate its acceptance of the central ity of the divinity and to dis play on its behalf the best available materials and workmanship. What ever the community had above mere subsistence was clear evidence of the divine munificence so that it was only right and just that the superfluous be returned in some worshipful form. In a world where harvests were governed by unpredictable events the least the com munity could do was to honor the source of whatever order provided the plenty when it was made available and to accept the suffering in humility on those occasions when it was not (Mumford, 1961:89, 575). This process through which the community siphoned off the excess of its produce and diverted it to representations to the sacred was ex traordinarily present in early and most especial ly in medieval Christian ity. One is reminded of the veritable explosion of building in stone which took place in western Europe between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries. The Church presence, so to speak, was mag nificently visable. When compared with the usual medieval civil or secular buildings the opulence of the church buildings—cathedrals, HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="7">8 shrines, chapels, and monastic enclosures—was starkly impressive and aesthetically intimidating (Jones, 1942:494-518). Giving collectively in such fashion was a clear expression on hu man inferiority and powerlessness in the presence of the Divine. It wasalsotantamounttotheexternalizingofmankind's guilt. St. Augus tine's City of God was a most respectable account of Adam's sin taken as the source of the stain which no man ever born could escape. On the other hand, it could be equally maintained that thanksgiving was due God for ordinary and extraordinary favors or blessings and such thanksgiving required unusual public expressions of gratitude. Com munities responded toeither, the penitential or the thanksgiving, with ingenuity and elaborate generosity. Certainly, as they saw it, their giving was fit for Christ the King! The fact that man worked so hard and denied himself somuchin order to produce monuments honoring his faith in God is obvious. His need to act in this fashion is one of the great aspects of the human drama which is often taken to be a mystery. What is the connection between man's need to work self-sacrificially on behalf of the sacred and theprocess of producing an ever expanding surplus of goods today? Perspicacious Thorstein Veblen in The Theory of the Leisure Class (rd. :240-242) grasped a multitude of the details associated with people he believed exemplified the compulsion to collect and display super fluous goods. More particularly he saw some association of this pro clivity to display with religion. In the chapter, "Devout Observances" he writes: "The consumption of ceremonial paraphernalia required by any cult, . . .serves no immediate material end. All this material apparatus may, therefore, without implying deprecation, be broadly characterized as items of conspicuous waste. . . . They are in so far HUMBOLDT JOURNALOFSOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="8">9 an obstruction to the most effective organization of industry under modern circumstances; and are, in the first instance, antagonistic to the development of ec onomic institutions in the direction required by the situation today. ... In economic theory. . .the consumption of goods and effort in the service of an anthropomorphic divinity means a lowering of the vi tality of the community." Veblendid not pursue the question of why intelligent men wouldput together a complex of social practices and beliefs whose ultimate goal was conscious waste. He detailed with consummate skill the behavioral manifestations of the psychological dedication to waste. For some unaccountable reason, however, he did not explore the significance of religion, perse, and its influence on apparently irrational economic practices of a community. His preoccupation with the sadism of pre datory practitioners of aggressive accumulation and conspicuous dis play in the modern economy revealed 'how' these practices operated and flourished, but not 'why.' Medieval religious practices are, nevertheless, instructive. Toa considerable extent giving to a religious collection may not only be regarded as a penitential deed by ordinary religious standards but also as an avenue of relief from the burden of using that portion of wealth one has acquired in a morally accepted manner. Various scriptural injunctions concerning rich men and salvation, charity with one's goods and grace, were widely known and accepted literally (Leclerq, 1959:21-31). By giving wealth to the Church the burden of that wealth as an obstacle to salvation was released to those anointed to handle such dangerous and possibly corrupting challenges to one's search for a happy eternity. One is hard put to exaggerate the fear which the presence of earthly riches raised in the heart of the sincere believer. The accumulation of wealth wasnot looked on as a good in itself, but, on the contrary, as a repudiation of the notion that the world's goods are simply a means to a spiritual end. Not by any stretch of the mind HUMBOLDT JOURNALOF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="9">10 could seeking material goods be considered as an end in itself. (Hoi I is, 1961:7-23; Heer, 1963:380-381; von Simson, I962:xvii-xxiii and 3-58. The Reformation sundered the integrity of the age-old viewsponsored by the Roman Church regarding the danger of accumulating wealth. No longer did vast network of the Roman Church command unchallenged the destiny of the community's surplus goods. No longerdid this broad lycollected wealth reflect a grand but vita! waste on behalf of man's redemptive needs. Man's strong willingness to deny himself pleasure, to work on behalf of a God whose penance included conspicuous giving and demanded specific attention to the poor, was diverted. The sur plus was no longer gathered together by religious authorities and de voted to God conspicuously. Protestantism privatized the surplus. The decentralization of the control of a community's economic surplus did not, however, eliminate theproblem of the surplus. The Reformation's ultimate effect was to re-locate the surplus; it was diffused. Aided and abetted by a frenzy of economic activity encouraged by the rup ture in the moral critique long promulgated and supervised by Roman Church law and authorities and by the individualism which attended it, the economic surplus was atomized. Each individual who found this new position appealing struggled to gain some portion of the earth's goods for himself. Rationalized by new theologies—especially that of Calvin—and encouraged by philosophies of asceticism, economic individualism (social irrationality under the direction of individual rationalism) setabout the task of justifying wholesale acquisitiveness. The post-Reformation world was an environment of individual economic exuberance (Weber, 1958:95-154, 180-183, note 66, 232-233). The trans-individual morality of the traditional was challenged. The concept of a religious institution intermediary between God and man (The Roman Catholic Church) privileged to organize and direct a morality whose imperatives rested equally on every one was directly attacked. The results of an ascetic demand arising from penitential beliefs which collectivized a community's wealth in a conspicuous public display made on behalf of God was frankly ridiculed and de HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="10">II clared a political, economic, and morol anathema. ... Protestant asceticism was individualized and privatized. Wealth was accordingly pursued without stigma so long as it was not turned to purely personal, i.e., subject ends. The displacement of ethical con trols from religious authorities to individuals destroyed the effective moral universals of the old Church. Economic authorities and principles came gradually to fill the vacuum. Religious anarchy and economic anarchy marched hand-in-hand; it was the final repudiation ofthe long-standing value matrix whichassumed religion to be the most pri mary ofal I forms of social control, human solidarity, and social aspira tion and direction (Little, 1969:33-56). The logic as well as the social ramifications of this new religious view required time for the disclosure of many of its details and impli cations. Certainly the work of the community was no longer centrally involved in the expiation of its collective guilt by wayof the construc tion of religious monuments. Now members of a locality positively expressed themselves in work which was conceived of in itself as a form of worship. From being a result of the curse of God on Adam to being a religious vocation in itself meantthat work as a religious con cept had gone through a most amazing redemptive process. Work was good! What work produced was good! A complete reversal of inter pretation had taken place mainly under Calvin and the energies released obscured the need within a short time for man the penitent to demon strate publicly his personal subservience to God. The new religious interpretation did not require an intermediary bringing God and sinner together through sacraments of reconciliation; the new church was a social means of communication by which one identified with others whose faith revealed their saved condition and status, and an associa tion of those who vowed the transformation of the world through hard work and ascetic resistance to the use of the fruits of one's labor for pleasure or luxury (Little, 1969:57-80). According to the new religion it was not the product of work but HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="11">12 the act of work Itself which was sufficient to represent a man's com mitment to God. If he fervently believed that Christ had died for his sins, and that, because of this, he, the sinner, was saved, this was all that was required. Faith in one's ultimatesalvation was the unique criterion of exoneration from the perils of temptation and the Devil. Fulminations of Luther against good works as the way to salvation merely underlined the point. That Luther pointed out how acquisitive ness is clearly a sign of bondage to the Devil appears to have been lost in the intoxication created by this new religious wine. That he claimed the world to be the total domain of the Devil surely was lost on Protestantism and certainly on the new philosophers of economic individualism. Calvin seems to have fared better; he was praised as architect of the new order. In the turbulent post-Reformation world it was assumed that wealth could now be privately gathered and concentrated for purely private purposes whateverone thought of the scriptural injunctions against the dangers of wealth. The decentralization of moral judgment regarding the proper use of wealth atomized and diffused controls and made the economy a hotbed of ruthless competitors each governed by his own privately constructed moral code. The emperor and pope in this new world was self-interest. Each ruled by divine right. The secularization of the sacred surplus—if I maysodesignate that wealth traditional ly (if primatively) produced and set aside for purely religious representation of the people's conspicuous commitment to God's scheme for the world—was, perhaps, thesingle most influential result of the Reformation. That this diffusion of wealth was not under stood and/or appreciated for what it was at that time seems, at this point in time, to be clear. Historically it seems that de facto com mitmentto the traditional rationale and pre-occupation with the cus stomary attitudes and wealth-using and displaying practices probably kept the logic inherent in the newsituation disguised. In time, how ever, the implicit became explicit and the false god became the real god of this acquisitively motivated and directed working world. As HUMBOLDT JOURNALOF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="12">13 Norman O. Brown says, "We no longer give the surplus to God; the process of producing an ever expanding surplus is in itself now our God. And since God is morehuman than civilization, the emancipa tion of the economic process from control by God completes the dehu manization of man" (1959:261). Various rationalizations were produced to justify and popularize the new preoccupation of man with the economic. Generally the writings of Hobbes, Locke and Adam Smith paid lip-service to the old God and to the social value of a common morality. But among people fascinated with the notion that society is nothing more than the aggregate of market relationships there could hardly be agreement on a unity ofcontrol except of the kind visualized by Thomas Hobbes; government was to be the ul timate referee among competing marketeers. The establishment of minimum economic uniformity on behalf of the greatest possible latitude for participants in the markets coupled with the notion that markets were essential ly self-regulating carried the day. The dominant operational concept was freedom. Adam Smith's idea of the 'invisible hand' in the market place was ingenious: "if every individual rationally pursue his self-interest and greatest happiness, society will function satisfactorily of itself" (Goldman, 1973:26). Acting in one'sown interest is (amazingly) acting in the public interest, according to the new doctrine, but sucha principle was marked; it was a failure as a substitute for the religiously sponsored moral control of greed and avarice which formerly controlled economic venturing. From denial of the right to pursue personal gratification to promotion of the positive right to pursue it to the exclusion of other goals of possible equal or greated importance was a major turning point in the history of the past four centuries. it is widely agreed that Max Weber has not said the last word about the relationship between work as an inner psychological necessity and Puritanism (Eisenstadt, 1968:3-45). Weber certainly pointed up the interdependency of economic and non-economic, specifical ly re I igious values and their moral influences in the production and legitimation HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="13">14 of common socio-economic practices. And his emphasis of asceticism revealed the religious, economic, social and psychological aspects of this propensity of Calvinism todiscipline anddirecta man away from private indulgence toward public service. A distinguished French anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss, has, like Weber, pointed out non-economic aspects of economic activity and has attempted to make us aware of the unconscious content of consciously conducted daily activities. In examining the principle of reciprocity in social matters Levi Strauss refersspecifically to Christmas in the United States as "nothing more than a gigantic potlach, implicating millions of individuals and at the end of which many family budgets are faced with lasting dis equilibrium. . . .(This annual ritual giving is not) "merely nor essen tially of an economic nature but is. . .an event which has a signifi cance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, util itarian and sentimental, jural and moral" (Levi-Strauss, 1969:56). Levi-Strauss is clearly referring to Mauss's theory of reciprocity in gift-giving (Mauss: 1967) which holds that gift-giving is commonly practiced in primitive and archaic societies for reasons which are clear ly un-economic, or, supra-economic. In suggesting that Christmas in the United States elaborately involves the primitive attitudes and pro cedures of reciprocal gift-giving Levi-Strauss gets close to the mark. More specifically, he writes: "Richly decorated Christmas cards certainly do not at tain the value of 'coppers,' but the refinement shown in thei rselection, theiroriginality, theirprice (which although individually modest is none the less to be multiplied by the number), and the quantity sent or received, are the proof, ritually exhibited on the re cipients mantelpiece during the week of celebrations, of the wealth of his social relationships or the degree of his prestige. The subtle techniques of gift wrapping HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 -5:1</page><page sequence="14">15 must also be mentioned, all expressing in their way the personal bond between the giver and the gift, and the magical function of the gift, suchas the special wrap ping paper, ribbons appropriate to the occasion, heral dic labels, and so on. Through the uselessness of the gifts, and their frequent duplication because of the limited range of objects suitable as presents, these exchanges also take the form of a vast and collective destruction of wealth" (1969:56). Referring to the above work Norman O. Brown says, "As Levi Strauss. . .points out, Christmas giving is nowhere so elaborate as in capitalist America, as if the year-round psychology of taking was can celled and atoned by an annual ritual which returns to the archaic psychology of giving (1959:263). Before post-World War II Christmases there were several significant manifestations of a return to a conspicuous display of personal wealth. Without the traditional moral admonitions against excessive accumula tion of wealth to provoke their interest in questions of moral destiny, individuals in early industrializing England appear to have developed an ethic whose premise was that great private wealth had to be public ly displayed in grand fashion (Thorndike, 1976). Veblen has dabbled in the operations of display used by people under the pressures of this ethic. One is reminded of the phenomena of many great American accumulators (Veblen would call them 'captains of industry or finance') such as Carnegie, Rockefeller, Morgan, Stanford, and Mellon, to name a representative few. Each publicly situated his wealth: Carnegie in public libraries, Rockefeller in the University of Chicago and in a famous research institute university which bears his name, Morgan in a library and art collection, Stanford in a university, and Mellon in an industrial research institute, a gallery of art, and endowed chairs atvarious universities around the nation. Each man dedicated a sub stantial portion of an ample fortune to public use: a gift for publica tion, display, and admiration. Is this gift-giving essential ly different HUMBOLDT JGURNALOF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="15">16 from that traditionally advocated and practiced by religious? If as Lewis Mumford hints (1961) the city is but a dump made up of the sacred surplus, and, if the sacred surplus is man's admission of guilt in the face of his god, then why should it not be interpreted that the displays of the great capitalists are nothing more than the external ization of guilt? If, following N. O. Brown, "The temple buildings which dominate the first cities are monuments of accumulated guilt and expiation " (I959:263ff), then why not Stanford and Chicago Uni versities ? Further, why not extend the proposal to encompass the frentic activ ities ofmillions of Americans at Christmastime? Christmas appears to be a long moment of masochistic exuberance in which each desperately tries to send cards to everyone worthy of some social attention and attempts to purchase gifts for an inner circle of ever worthier types. The compulsion to notify, to consciously identify those to whom one owes debt of attention, appears to suggesta quality of guilt of the old order. In a sense the practices seem to say, "One hasn't the time, one has been too busy to be human, therefore, one is guilty and must some how rectify the guilt one feels by demonstrations of compensation.' Thus, Christmas cards and gifts are a result of everyman's feeling guilty about the patterns and practices of life which force one to condone and support the oppressive pursuits of modern urban economy at the expense of one's own humanity, community, and social solidarity. The individual feels that he is involved against his will, that some thing diabolical is pushing him deeper into a way of life which is re pulsive, alienating, and ultimately destructive of his sense of unity and being. The 'establishment' is the world and one is guilty because one has participated in the construction of this prison from which there is no escape. Modern man, like Faust, is doomed because he lacks a sense of doom. Still, modern man half-heartedly tries to make amends for his plight. To escape his predicament he seeks out the old religious forms and mo HUMBCLDT JOURNALOF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 -5:1</page><page sequence="16">17 mentarilyand in sputtering fashion involves himself in traditional rit uals; those of Christmas are most appealing. He practices personal generosity on a scale which would shock him if similarly practiced at any other time. The American spends with gusto, and, as if caught up in the psychology of the orgy, he repudiates momentarily his usual caution and fear in the face of money. To be ir-reverent with that which usually elicits the highest reverence is no light matter. The debts contracted at Christmas time are often, as Levi-Strauss reminded us, (1969:56) enough to bring lasting disequilibrium into many family budgets. The debts are, for many, a burden the entire forthcoming year. Obviously, such a financial burden has to be considered very seriously as a demonstration of something more than friendliness or hospitableness! By burdening one's self with substantial debt or by using one's sav ings magnanimously one is demonstrating that one is truly devoted to the American economy among other things. One is also saying that one's allegiance to the American way of life is more than superficial. One is willing to suffer by burdening one's self with substantial debt on behalf of thegeneral economy's continued health! In another sense we are admiring the capacities of ourselves, collectively speaking, to produce goods so munificently. We narcissistical ly marvel at not what God hath wrought but at what we Americans have produced. All the gadgetry, electronically sophisticated 'toys' and kitchen implements, self-indulging garments, soaps and perfumes, and complex momentary distractions from our daily preoccupations attest to our self-admiration. More specifically, at Christmas time home decoration becomes an industry. Conspicuous display is not a leisure class activity as Veblen maintained—it is a social compulsion. Families work long punishing hours designing and executing the decorative scheme they believe appropriate for the home in both its exterior and its interior aspects. Often the exterior is draped with expensive lighting equipment and sometimes with professionally prepared representations (animated and with sound) of traditional as well as modern Christmas symbols (from HUMBOLDT JOURNALOFSOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="17">18 the creche to Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed Reindeer). Conspicuous display is competitive. Prizes are awarded in many communities for outstanding displays. A select committee judges which is the 'best1 or the most ingenious arrangement. Public utility companies distributing electric power publicize the most unusual lighting or power-operated gadgetry in an outdoor home display. In smaller communities newspaper and televi sion publicity is granted this unusual activity. Power and light com panies, Chambers of Commerce, and municipal corporations provide prizes for the winners. Competition is not only between individual homeowners within the same time or city but in some regions of the country it is between vi I lages, towns, andcities. Municipalities also compete in ingenuity in designing and carrying-out public street light ing and/or public Christmas tree presentations. One is also reminded of the competition between states to be selected as the donor of the 'national' Christmas tree which will be erected in Washington and lighted by the President in a special ceremony as an aspect of this same preoccupation. At the local level it is not only the outside of the home which re ceives attention. Inside the home extensive cleaning and decoration isinorder. Not only is therean appropriate tree of the fir or pine family decorated with lights, glass balls, tinsel and imitation snow or other furnishings maybe used as bases for festive decoration. These are time consuming and expensive practices. Electricity costs in many homes double in December. Since some display is socially imperative, one is not supposed to protest the costs in labor or materials. The world of work is also affected . Those who work regularly out side the home alter their attitudes toward labor at Christmas time. It is tacitly understood that real work is abbreviated in the week or two preceeding the festive day. Asocial fiction is cleverly substituted which maintains that one maintains the forms of work while in fact dis pensing with the reality of its contents. Visiting for social purposes HUMBOLDT JOURNALOF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="18">19 is condoned; time taken outof work for conversation, coffeedrinking, luncheons, or cocktail interludes is very extensive when compared with the practices of other months of the year. Make-believe work displaces actual productive practices in the seasonal period which leads up to a company sponsored feast at a restaurant or club for em ployees. Lavish displays of food, drink, andclothing make such oc casions notable—one which is anticipated and supported by all but a few. It is a party which signals the peak event of the year. On the other hand, some who have not worked regularly in the economy and who normally would be considered as non-workers strug gle to uncover seasonal employment in order to gain unaccustomed income. These people deliberately put themselves out in order to gain out-of-the-ordinary money to spend on cards, gifts, and seasonal clothing and partying. This self-sacrificial aspect is clearly of a punishing kind. The demands are considerable on a person who feels strongly that he will lose prestige among his friends if he does not per form as expected. His historical record in the memories of his friends is of deep concern to him. Expected behavior in the manner of hos pitality, gifts, and demonstrations of seasonal prodigality is strong and for many irrefutable. Such conspicuous display and consumption clear I yea I Is for the deep est value loyalty on the parts of individuals who extend themselves selflessly on behalf of what appears to be heroic proportions of gen erosity and hospitality. What appears to be the clear celebration of an ancient religious feast is rather the occasion for the use of the feast as a disguise for a modern social display in which society recognizes its collective accomplishments through individual interpretation and demonstrations of conspicuous waste (Veblen, nd:240-248; 284ff). Christmas in the United States is primarily the major occasion on which the American people unreflectively pay homage to their economic system and demonstrate in admiration of themselves as the world's out standing producers of material wealth. In a secondary and clearly HUMBOLDT JOURNALOF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="19">20 residual sense, Christmas is an anachronistic rel igious feast. The former grew out of the latter. Apparently, the sacred once surrounding the traditional rel igious feast has been transplanted to the modern holiday just as the reverence once identified with the Christ child has now migrated to the gifts brought in respect of His presence of His birth. We concentrate on what the Three Wise Men brought, not on the per son who was the occasion of their visit. Having served them wel I, relatively speaking, throughout the year, Americans acknowledgetheirdebt to theeconomyby obligating them selves to purchase a mass of superfluous goods at self-sacrificial cost which they distribute as gifts, sumptously displayed, to family, rela tives, friends, and, business, political, orsocial acquaintances. The pain of debt, clearly present, is accepted as the price each is apparent ly willing to pay to prove his belief in the system and his obvious loyalty to the practices and produce of the American system. Christmas is not the secularization of the ancient Christian feast! Many rel igious commentators assert that it is, however. Rather, Christ mas is a replacement of the ancient feast by a new one that is certain ly religious, but religious in a manner fitting to an individualized soc ietycaptivated byand in aweof its own material accomplishments. Whose miracles and magic have gained greater notoriety than those of the American industrial economy in the twentieth century? What country is the focal point of every underdeveloped country and the envy and admiration of international society generally? If, then, we ask, when did the new form of Christmas come to prominence and dominance? We have a question which can only be answered impressionistical ly. Clearly it has to do with the wizardry of technologies underwritten by man's most successful attempts to con trol nature and death and to overcome the scarcity of goods. The pro duction of a multitude of interlocking technologies created debtors. The fact that the Olympian riches of the gods have been brought to earth and placed in the hands of ordinary vocational ists is a sign of the HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 1977 - 5:1</page><page sequence="20">21 wonder working power once associated with the Lord Himself being decentralized and diffused. Everyman is Prometheus! The American can and must acknowledge this condition by showering his fellow gods with the goods traditionally reserved for the sacred, i.e., the super fluous, the luxurious, the golden! Given the conditions of modern industrial urban society, man can't give himself; his loyalty to and utter dependence on things rather than people prevents that! He can give, however. The modern system is the institutionalization of the mass decision to give things; this is the price man pays for the loss of face-to-face community. Modern man's tragedy is that he cannot satisfactorily solve his need for both people and goods in generous amounts on a continuing basis. The circulation of gifts is an attempt to diffuse and circulate the guilt which many if not all feel in their inability to be generous, kind, lovingand peaceable on a continuing basis throughout the year. Rec ognizing his separation from the sources of true humanity and enjoy ment of life results in a consciousness which expresses itself in the act of forming a temporary but artificial community. Thisfragile 'gemein schaft' exists long enough to provide those nostalgic moments so nec essary to justify the frenzy of creating the temporary webbing which ties individuals together via cards, gifts, visits, parties, etc. The absurdity of the Christmas season lies in the contradiction involved in the repudiation of usual attitudes to scarcity and to the sacredness of money and the wi 11 ing substitution of its opposite in attitudes and prac tice, and, in the attempt to organize an island of community in the isolating sea of expanding individual ism and industrial specialization.. This gigantic fiction in which everyone seemingly becomes a magus promotes and condons activities that at any other time of the year would be regarded as wasteful, idiotically irrational, and devoid of theelements offrugality, prudence, and temperance, so vital to com mon economic practices and the pursuit of self-interest. As soberness gives way to intoxication, penuriousness to prodigality, ego-centered ness to togetherness, discretion to carelessness, Americans demonstrate how they have been caught-up in the spirit of the season. For a brief HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - F/W 19 77 - 5:1</page><page sequence="21">22 moment the masses are intensely captivated by their voluntary repudia tion of their everyday values and reflexivity; for a few brief days they escape the confinement imposed upon them by national preoccupation with scarc ity, saving, calculation, making money, investment, econo mic one-upmanship and ego-tripping. This release is salutary—re demptive—a welcome relief from the socially enforced demand for achievement and success based on the premises of economic liberalism and American economic experience. Like any purifying experience and activity it operates, once completed, asa restorative, i.e., as a means of reinvigorating one for the return to the mundane operations and activities of everyday life (Durkheim, 1965). The utilitarianism of the marketplace and the productive facilities that supply it are methodical, predictable, and of calculated uniformity, when compared to the contradictions of Christmasactivities. In engaging in the rituals of norm repudiation for a fewdaysat Christmas time the typical Ameri can asserts by returning to his usual vocational activities once the feast is past that he is a faithful son and supporter of the commodity system he reveres as the prime supplier of the indispensable needs of his sub sistence. Asa good and faithful servant he worships once a year that which he is inextricably dependent upon by returning to the gods of the marketplace a token of the shower of goodness it has rained upon him during the previous eleven months. His servitude is insured by the magnitude of his debts, and the gods are pleased! As Annemarie De Wall Malefijt writes (1968:14): Other ritual acts, which may be termed religious, attempt toovercome social conflicts, to protect codes of behavior, to avoid or resolve power clashes, and so on. In other words, religion is directed toward the attempts to overcome the gap between the existence of social rules and man's inability to abide by them at all times. There is no society in which the moral code isnot broken from time to time. Religious ritual, in this view, serves to men the social disturbances caused by violations of social norms.
