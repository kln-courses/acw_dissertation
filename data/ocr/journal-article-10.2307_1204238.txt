There is within feminist theology a small but growing number of works by women who have left behind their inherited religious traditions, usually Chris- 107</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion tianity and Judiasm, but have remained "religious." The work of Mary Daly, Naomi Goldenberg, Carol Christ, and, more recently, Sharon Welch come to mind. Daphne Hampson's Theology and Feminism is a sometimes puzzling but nonetheless welcome addition to that group. Hampson's self-professed theme is that feminism and Christianity are incom- patible. However, she states that her own reason for leaving Christianity is unre- lated to her commitment to feminism. While she does not disagree with feminist criticisms of Christianity, she subordinates such criticisms to her prior rejection of Christianity on grounds of cognitive incredulity. Hampson is unable to accept that "there could be particular events, such as a resurrection, or miracles, events which interrupt the normal causal relationships persisting in history and in nature" (p. 8), and she believes that such claims are essential to Christianity. Thus, Hampson rejects Christianity because it is not true. However, according to Hampson, feminism's essential argument against Christianity is that it is morally corrupt in its understanding and treatment of women. The puzzle that runs throughout this book is how these two arguments are related. Taken alone, Hampson's characterization of the feminist argument need not lead to outright rejection of Christianity. Rather, as many Christian feminists have done, one could well argue that Christianity is in need of reform, whether in fidelity to its essential message or in response to the changing needs of its adherents or both. Consequently, while Hampson, on the one hand, outlines and supports many of the feminist arguments against sexist aspects of Christianity, on the other hand, she argues against feminist attempts to reform Christianity. Her arguments rest on an understanding of Christianity as an essentially historical religion, by which she means one that cannot ignore or change its patriarchal roots. Here we reach an impasse. Unless one shares Hampson's conservative understanding of the essence of Christianity, one will not be swayed by her argu- ments against feminist Christianity. Again, how these arguments are related to her own rejection of Christianity on cognitive grounds is not clear. As one who seeks to do theology as a feminist outside the bounds of Christian- ity, I find Hampson's book most provocative not in her criticisms of Christianity, feminist or otherwise, but in glimpses of her own constructive position. For example, methodologically, she advocates what she calls an "ethical a priori" position, in which "certain principles are held to be an a priori and not subject to qualification" (p. 29). The term "a priori" is one that draws suspicion from most feminists, including myself, and yet, for many, feminism rests on certain unquali- fied statements about women. Theologically, Hampson focuses on conceptualiz- ing God in terms other than those provided by the Christian tradition and calls for increased "perceptivity" of God's presence in individual experience. One of the most interesting questions she raises is what prayer might mean for a person like herself, who does not conceive of God in anthropomorphic terms. Her own view is that the term "God" has a referent and that in order to be meaningful, this referent must be evidenced through the efficacy of prayer. Surprisingly, the sort of evidence she seeks is scientific/empirical. But all of this is just touched on in this book. Thus, I look forward to a future book in which she turns to the con- structive task. C. W. MAGGIE KIM, Chicago, Illinois. 108</page></plain_text>
