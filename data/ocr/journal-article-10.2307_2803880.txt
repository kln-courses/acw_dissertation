<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIDER AND THE PANGOLIN I.M. LEWIS London School of Economics &amp; Political Science In the tarantism cult of southern Italy there are two types of actual tarantula spider with which the spirit spider might be identified, but only one is selected as spirit counterpart. In examining the basis of symbol selection here, reference is also made to Lele pangolin symbolism where there are again actually two species of local pangolin, only one of which is paid cult. Mary Douglas's classic analysis ofanimal 'anomalies' fails to address this problem. In the context ofa comparison ofpangolin ritualisation in other Congolese cultures, the following critique of Douglas's treatment of pangolin 'anomalies' suggests a cosmological solution to this puzzle. Douglas's attempt to correlate pangolin power with exogamy is also shown to be questionable. More generally, it is argued that where two or more related animals are subject to differential symbolisation a satisfactory interpretation should explain why one is selected for preferential ritual attention. I In her seminal essay on Lele religious symbolism, Mary Douglas (1957) rightly observed that, in order to be effective, symbols do not need to be grounded in objectively accurate knowledge and may indeed be based on mistaken information. So, in the case of animals selected to act as symbols, what matters is not actual animal behaviour but rather the characteristics and properties imputed to them by those who employ them as symbols. The famous tarantismo spider cult of southem Italy shows how this dictum may sometimes be applicable at one level while not applying at others. The tarantula spirit spider in Apulia (the region containing the eponymous town of Taranto) has potentially two types of actual tarantula spider (Latrodectus and Lycosa) with which it might be identified, but only one (Lycosa) is selected as the actual counterpart for the spirit. The spider (Latrodectus) which is passed over is, paradoxically, armed with a toxic bite capable of indeed causing the symptoms associated with tarantism. This situation of two similar zoological categories, only one of which receives ritual attention, has parallels in Lele animal symbolism (and is not unknown elsewhere). Douglas bases her famous analysis of the 'anomalous' pangolin on one type (Manis tricuspis) and rather passes over the other pangolin (Manis gigantea) which is also found among the Lele. As we shall see, this raises questions about the adequacy of her anomaly argument and invites further consideration of her data. More generally, where such pairs of related zoological avatars are subject to such differential symbolisation this offers a unique opportunity to test the validity of theories of symbolisation. A fully satisfactory interpretation should be able to explain the circumstances in which one of the pair is chosen at the expense of the other. Man (N.S.) 26, 513-525</page><page sequence="2">514 I.M. LEWIS With its roots in the middle ages, tarantism survives on a reduced scale in parts of contemporary southern Italy where the classical study of the phenomenon was made by the pioneer of Italian ethno-sociology (the precursor of social anthro- pology in Italy), Ernesto de Martino (1961) and his team. Here the cult typically involves women who are recruited by being bitten by the tarantula 'spider' and seek a cure in domestic rituals, conducted with the appropriate musical accom- paniment (tarantella); or at Christian shrines such as that in St Paul's chapel at Galatina in Salente (Apulia), which was studied by de Martino and his colleagues (for more recent research, see Montinaro 1976; Castiglione 1977). The symptoms of the affliction which, in its acute phase, may include dizziness, weakness, feelings of anguish, psychomotor agitation, stomach and muscular pains, nausea and in- creased erotic appetite, are attributed to the bite of the tarantula. In Apulia there are two main types of actual tarantula: Lycosa and Latrodectus, the first of which, although armed with a savage bite, is essentially harmless. Latrodectus, in contrast, while not particularly aggressive and usually only attacking people when they inadvertently brush against it, is small and slow-moving but much more dangerous. Disarmingly, its bite is not immediately very painful at the location of the bite and may thus pass unnoticed for some time. However, although rarely fatal, the toxins injected by the bite have a powerful psychotropic effect, producing the symptoms mentioned above and causing the victim to feel severely ill for several days (de Martino 1961: 78; cf Gallini 1967: 278 sqq.). 11 Although the behaviour and symptoms actually produced by Latrodectus are thus closely similar to those in the acute phases of tarantism, this spider is not directly implicated in the cult. Members of the cult, initiated by a 'spider's bite', have not actually been bitten by this dangerous spider. As de Martino has elegantly demon- strated, the 'bite' which they have experienced is a symbolic or mythical construct which can recur at different stages in the life of the afflicted victim and may even run in families. It usually first occurs, and may recur, when the victim is subject to exceptional stress and personal difficulty. Initiation into this 'cult of affliction' (cf. Lewis 1989: 59 sqq.) thus assumes the form of symptoms of illness and distress which are interpreted as signs of the tarantula spirit's attack. Although through their agricultural work in the fields, men are in fact more prone to be bitten by the toxic Latrodectus spider, it is paradoxically the less directly exposed women who are the chief victims of tarantism in Apulia. Those so afflicted formerly sought relief in healing rituals, danced to the tune of the tarantella in the patient's own home. Today, however, recourse is more usually had in Apulia to the chapel of St Paul at the church in Galatina where exorcistic rituals are celebrated each year on the feast days of St Paul (28 and 29June). Here, inJune 1959 when they visited it, de Martino and his team found that thirty-two out of thirty-seven victims seeking relief from the spider's bite were women. Following the legend of St Paul's eradication of venomous creatures in Malta, the unique curative role of this shrine is based on the myth of the Apostle's travels in Italy and the hospitable reception he received at Galatina - in return for which he obtained blessings from God to cure those bitten by snakes, scorpions and tarantulas.</page><page sequence="3">I.M. LEWIS 515 This symbolic bite is administered by a symbolic tarantula which in local belief in Apulia assumes various sizes and colours and dances to different tarantula tunes. The spider's 'bite' is closely related to its size and energy and it passes on its specific characteristics to its victim. Each with its own personal name (e.g. Rosina, Peppina, Maria Antonietta), there are thus dancing and singing tarantulas; some excite their victims to melancholy, others to joy, aggression or erotic behaviour. Whatever its specific features, the tarantula introduces into the veins of its human prey a 'poison' which is believed to persist as long as the spider lives (and this symbolic tarantula is considerably longer-lived than its zoological equivalent). To achieve a measure of relief, the possessed victim (for that is her condition) must perform the 'dance of the little spider' (the tarantella), dancing 'as the victim possessed by the beast and as a heroine who forces it to dance with her' (de Martino 1961: 63). The possessed person argues with the spider, sometimes submitting to its demands and sometimes forcing it to submit until finally agreement is reached between them on the duration of the ritual and the timing of the next crisis. Once relief has been obtained for the time being, the grateiful victim pays homage to St Paul at his shrine in Galatina. A typical case discussed by de Martino (1961: 73 sqq.) in some detail illustrates the process involved here. Maria, whose father had died when she was 13 years old, was brought up by an aunt and uncle who lived in straitened circumstances. At the age of 18, Maria fell in love with a young man whose family disapproved of the relationship because of her poverty and who subsequently abandoned her. She suffered much from this disappointment. One Sunday while gazing pensively out of her window, Maria was suddenly 'bitten' by the spider and felt impelled to dance. About the same time, a woman who lived nearby began to regard Maria, despite her affliction, as a suitable bride for her son who was ill and often out of work. Mother and son accompanied Maria to the chapel at Galatina to pay homage to the saint and the mother took the opportunity of asking Maria if she would accept her son as husband. To gain time, still fascinated by her first love and not attracted by this proposal, Maria pleaded that she had not sufficient resources for a trousseau because of the cost of treatment for her tarantism. At this point, St Paul providentially appeared, ordering Maria not to marry, and summoning her to join him in a mystical union. Shortly afterwards, however, the son and his mother succeeded in luring Maria out to a deserted farm and forced her to live there in shame. After a little time, a quarrel occurred when her mortal spouse brusquely ordered her to iron his clothes. As she went out to return the iron she had borrowed from a neighbour, she met St Peter and St Paul who said to her: 'Leave the iron and come with us'. When Maria responded, 'And my husband, what of him?', she was told not to worry on that account. This incident occurred on a Sunday at exactly the time of day at which she had first been 'bitten' by the spider. After encountering the saint, Maria disappeared for three days, wandering in the fields. St Paul, annoyed that she had disobeyed his order not to marry, allowed her to be 'bitten' this second time, forcing her to dance for nine days. Reminded of her holy tryst by this strange love-bite, Maria eventually achieved a compromise between the rival interests of her human and spiritual spouses. She agreed to a formal marriage with her human seducer while continuing</page><page sequence="4">516 I.M. LEWIS to celebrate her spiritual union by an annual recurrence of her possession affliction in time to participate in the ceremonies on the Saint's feast-day. So, driven by circumstances to marry a man she did not want, Maria continued to pay periodical tribute to the tarantula and to the saint, reviving on each occasion, in the symbolism of the rite, the original adventure of the bite of love and being cured at the same time through the grace of her celestial husband. What had begun as an affliction attributed to the demonic spider, had found its apotheosis in a peculiarly intimate communion with St Paul. While Maria was thus able to control her illness through her annual participation in the Pauline rites at Galatina, this whole pattern of behaviour was highly expressive of her plight. Through these recurrent outbreaks, followed by treatment at the shrine, Maria was able to sustain her condemnation of her forced marriage, making conjugal life difficult, imposing severe economic stress on the family which she did not love, and flagrantly calling public attention to her problems. If she could not radically remedy her situation, at least she could continue to protest at it in a religious idiom which men could condone as a divinely sanctioned therapy (cf. de Martino, passim; and Lewis 1989: 80-3). The figure of St Paul here is extremely ambivalent. As might be anticipated, the Apostle is credited with causing the spirit-spider affliction he cures. On the one hand, there is the benevolent figure of St Paul, protector and healer of those bitten by the spider; on the other, there is a punitive St Paul who sends the tarantula to bite sinners. There is further the hybrid figure of St Paul-the-tarantula, or the tarantula-St Paul, which appears in the course of the exorcistic rites where the possessed victim speaks both as the tarantula and as St Paul. This identification is furthered in the experience of those women bitten by the spider who may have visions and drearm of St Paul, summoning them to mystical marriage. Earthier relations are suggested in the ribald invocations addressed by the afflicted women at his shrine: 'My St Paul of the Tarantists who pricks the girls in their vaginas' (de Martino 1961: 122). III Having established the main features of the culturally constructed symbolic spider and its bite, we return to examine its relationship to the two real tarantula spiders which actually occur locally. As we have seen, although the highly toxic bite of Latrodectus can produce symptoms which are typical of the initial and acute phases of the symbolic 'bite', this spider is paradoxically not directly implicated. On the contrary, the tarantula which is identified as the natural species whose bite is believed to cause spider possession is the Lycosa tarantula, a large black, hairy spider with menacing claws. This spider sleeps in an underground nest for most of the day, but at night it ranges widely in search of food. It weaves no web and moves rapidly, pursuing its victims vigorously and rearing up in an impressively aggressive manner as it closes in on its prey. The immediate local effects of its bite are more painful than those of Latrodectus which is a less visually striking and smaller spider, moving more sluggishly and less aggressively, and waiting for its prey at the centre of its web. Both spiders are quiescent during the winter and active in the summer when they mate and reproduce.</page><page sequence="5">I.M. LEWIS 517 Although it might be claimed that Lycosa receives attention because it does not spin a web and so is an 'anomalous' spider, there is no indication that this is regarded as a notable feature. Rather, it seems clear that the features which actually attract attention are not this but its size, aggression and sharp bite and that, on these grounds, it acquires symbolic salience as the zoological counterpart of the spirit spider. That the absence of a web is not of mystical import is also suggested by the fact that the spirit spider in the local tarantist ideology is endowed with a strong web which traps its victims, leaving them suspended to swing helplessly in the air with the wind (de Martino 1961: 61). De Martino thus seems perfectly correct to argue that the spirit spider is in fact a composite construction, drawing on the zoological characteristics and behaviour of both Lycosa and Latrodectus, though 'preferentially orientated' towards the former with its instantly impressive bite. The psychic crisis itself, however, nevertheless follows the pattern of the sympto- mology of the toxic bite of Latrodectus. The potentially generative effect of the Latrodectus bite seems confirmed by a case involving a male victim which de Martino (1961: 81) reports. Here a man was bitten by Latrodectus in a field in the summer as he slept behind his harvesting machine. He awoke at once and saw an image of a tarantula spirit spider. This victim was hospitalised for a few days until he was judged cured from a medical point of view. When discharged from hospital, however, this farm-worker re-experienced the 'bite' at intervals for several years, usually in the same season in the summer, and sought relief in tarantist rituals in which he spoke with St Paul while dancing frenetically. This potentially direct linkage between Latrodectus and tarantism is also evident in Sardinia where the phenomenon existed in the past and has been studied retrospectively by de Martino's protegee, Clara Gallini, and her students. Although the results collected by students with questionnaires are perhaps more problematic than de Martino's own data in Apulia, it seems clear that in Sardinia men working in the fields were the principal figures (77 per cent.) in the tarantist cult and that they were actually bitten by Latrodectus. Here the symbolic tarantula is always a female spirit of foreign origin and classified as unmarried, married or widowed, engaging in one of these capacities with the possessed male victim (Gallini 1988). IV As the presence of Latrodectus without tarantism in the United States indicates, we should beware of attributing too much to the causal influence of this spider's bite. However, this Sardinian evidence does appear to reinforce de Martino's conclusion, based on his data from Apulia, that 'the symbolism of the taranta is thus the autonomous result in the course of a certain cultural and religious history of real episodes of latrodectism which are relatively frequent during the summer work in the fields'. Hence, as a total cultural phenomenon, tarantism 'was not reducible to latrodectism but was also not independent of it, since latrodectism must be considered as an important historical and existential condition for the genesis of tarantism' (de Martino 1961: 53). But Lycosa rather than Latrodectus remains in Apulia the actual spider whose bite is supposed to cause tarantism. Thus the Douglas-type symbolic explanation here prevails over the materialist explanation (cf Hunn 1979).</page><page sequence="6">518 I.M. LEWIS The characteristics and behaviour of Lycosa, de Martino (1961: 60) further suggests, appropriately furnish 'a series of images which are particularly apt to provide a basis for the obscure pulsations of the unconscious, to the aggression of the hidden past which turns into the strangeness of the nervous symptom, to the internal bite which leads to the search for "he who bites", to the dream of renewal, of eroticism and fecundity, in harmony with the season in which you harvest as much as you have sowed and pay debts contracted on the economic plane as well as on the existential'. This imaginative interpretation of spider symbolism, linking it to the situations of conflict experienced by those diagnosed as possessed, has, of course, strong psychoanalytic overtones1 taking us beyond our present brief which is simply concerned with the relation between real and attributed features in spider symbolism in Apulia. Here, then, we have an interesting situation in which there are two zoological models for the symbolisation of the archetypal tarantula. Mainly, apparently, on account of its physical characteristics and the immediate pain of its bite, Lycosa has been selected as the ideal template in preference to Latrodectus. Despite its toxic bite and the parallel between the symptoms it actually produces and those of tarantism, Latrodectus is, mistakenly in biological terms, largely ignored. Neverthe- less it contributes its web to the spinrt spider's symbolic accoutrements, and the real effects of its bite seem to underlie the whole cultural formation and may (although this would be hard to prove) have the causal force postulated by de Martino. Finally, before returning to the Lele, it should be stressed that the features which are seen in the Lycosa tarantula as making it a fitting representation of the spirit spider are all treated as positively appropriate (size, aggression, speed, impressive bite). The specific aptness of these characteristics is apparently the basis for drawing the equation between spirit and animal. In what follows I shall argue that the Lele scaly ant-eater (pangolin) is endowed with spiritual force not so much - as Douglas claims - because it is negatively 'anomalous' and does not fit in anywhere, but rather because it fits extremely well into several different dimensions which it links together, suggestively, serving as a potent bridging symbol. It is thus, as it were, positively over-endowed, rather than negatively under-endowed as a potential symbolic vehicle. V Amongst the Lele, as Douglas recounts, the pangolin cult is the only cult in which an animal is the cult object. This fertility cult is open exclusively to men who have begotten children of both sexes, 'Pangolin men' being Lele elders who already belong to the less exclusive Begetters Society (cf. footnote 9). The pangolin, which is referred to as 'chief , 'because he makes women conceive' (Douglas 1957: 55), is ritually hunted and eaten in a communal fertility feast which will bring 'animals in droves' and 'babies to women'. There are, however, in fact two pangolins - the small pangolin (Manis tricuspis) and the large pangolin (Manisgigantea). Women may not touch the former, nor eat the latter if they are pregnant - but only the first is the object of'a major cult' (Douglas 1957: 57). According to Douglas, the pangolin is described by the Lele in terms in which there is no mistaking its anomalous character. They say: 'In our forest there is an animal with the body and tail of a fish, covered in scales. It has four little legs and</page><page sequence="7">I.M. LEWIS 519 it climbs in the trees'. For the Lele, 'the pangolin is anomalous in other ways. Unlike other animals, it does not shun men but offers itselfpatiently to the hunter... Furthermore, the pangolin reproduces itself after the human rather than the fish or lizard pattern... Lele say that, like humans, it gives birth to one child at a time. This in itself is sufficiently unusual to mark the pangolin out from the rest of the animal creation and cause it to be treated as a special kind of link between humans and animals' (Douglas 1957: 50). The contrast with the excessive procreative success of parents of twins is striking. 'Parents of twins are regarded as having been selected by the spirits for a special role, mediating between humans, and animals and spirits. Pangolins perform a corresponding role in the animal sphere' (Douglas 1957: 51). At the end of her original presentation of the pangolin, Douglas raises the problem of the existence among the Lele of the two pangolins and the ritual predominance of the small pangolin, noting that pangolin cults occur in other parts of the Congo and that 'a historical solution' may be required here. In a later publication, she returns en passant to the problem, invoking the authority ofJan Vansina to say, in effect, that the small pangolin is more anomalous than the large one (Douglas 1975: 46). If this is zoologically the case (as Douglas implies) we should, presumably, find this reflected in a similar ritual discrimination in favour of the small pangolin in other parts of the Congo where it is paid cult and both varieties of pangolin occur. The facts, however, do not seem to bear this out. Biebuyck (1953) describes the ritual killing and consumption of the pangolin by members of an exclusive association, called Bwame, among the Ba Lega of eastern Congo where pangolins are so sacred they are not directly hunted. Here the pangolin which is praised as being 'bigger than an elephant', a 'true agnate - child of the earth', is revered as having taught man the art of house roofing, house tops being decorated with leaves arranged like the scales on a pangolin. In this patrilineal society, the pangolin is also identified with the maternal uncle, and the sister's sons play a major role in its sacramental dismemberment for ritual slaughter by the Bwame-society. As befits an animal surrounded by elaborate interdictions, the division of the pangolin's meat is a complex process as it is widely shared and after its consumption the participants purify themselves by bathing because 'they have just touched a highly taboo'd animal' (Biebuyck 1953: 924). The cultic treatment of the pangolin here is not identical to, but parallels that among the Lele. However, in contrast to the Lele focus on the small pangolin (Manis tricuspis), here the ritual spotlight is on the large pangolin (Manis gigantea).2 Unfortunately, Biebuyck does not give us any very specific information comparable to Douglas's on how generally the Ba Lega speak of their pangolin (gigantea). While, like the two tarantulas, both pangolins are nocturnal in habit (a trait not mentioned by Douglas but likely to be of significance for their spirit connexions), unlike the partly arboreal Manis tricuspis, the giant pangolin is terrestrial and can swim. It also has the rather arresting feature of standing erect on its hind legs.3 Although we do not know at present what part, if any, these distinctive features of Manis gigantea play in its ritual precedence among the Ba Lega, neither do we know how they are discounted by the Lele. Nor, of course, do we know how such preferences might be affected by wider differences in culture and social structure, between the matrilineal Lele cultivators on the one hand, and the</page><page sequence="8">520 I.M. LEWIS patrilineal Ba Lega fishermen and hunters on the other. De Heusch, for instance, argues from Biebuyck's material that the larger pangolin (referred to by the Lega as the 'elder') is the appropriate focus of attention where (as he claims rather than demonstrates) primogeniture is especially valued. Here, according to him, socio- logical factors determine pangolin preference. But, amongst the Lele, for reasons de Heusch does not explain, cosmological rather than sociological forces prevail and, with its arboreal (bird-like) character, 'the cosmogonic wealth of the small pangolin is obviously greater than that of its bigger counterpart' (de Heusch 1985: 34-7).4 Amongst another patrilineal Congolese people, the Komo, who live round and to the south-east of Kisangani, it is again the large pangolin rather than the smaller tricuspis that is the focus ofritual interest. Here the giant pangolin is closely associated with the men's major circumcision rituals in this extremely ritualistic culture. The initiators' headdress is explicitly compared to the pangolin's head, the claws are compared both to the rattle-adorned ankles of the initiators (which reproduce the sound made by the scales ofManisgigantis as it moves), and to the fly-whisks which they wield. In the manner of Douglas, de Mahieu (1980: 39; 1985: 200) argues that as one of the seven principal, ritually significant animals (the others are the large and little crocodile, antelope, python, parrot and stork), the 'large pangolin is ambiguously placed between the class of fishes and the quadrupeds andfrom this fact [sic] constitutes a choice symbol for the rites which effect transitions between age-classes.'5 For reasons that are 'difficult to explain', de Mahieu (1985: 204) adds, the little pangolin (Manis tricuspis) has no particular symbolic meaning for the Komo and is not subject to ritual interdictions. Here, interestingly, the large pangolin is not linked with the Komo equivalent of the Lele association of men who have produced children (the 'begetters') - in whose initiation the symbolically charged animals involved are: the large crocodile, antelope, python, parrot and stork (de Mahieu 1980: 41). Paired with the small crocodile, the large pangolin is exclusively involved in the male circumcision rites. Here, therefore, the 'anomalous' mono-reproductive habits of the pangolin appear to be disregarded by the Komo, who seem rather to associate the scaly ant-eater with male potency more generally and, perhaps, as Vansina (personal communica- tion) suggests here and in other Congolese cultures, with 'big men'. Although we thus have at the moment only scattered, random information on the ritual priority of these two pangolins in different Congolese cultures (under- lining the need for a thorough comparative analysis), we should note that the Lele are not necessarily anomalous in preferring Manis tricuspis. This ritual preference is shared by their neighbours, the Bushong. For the Bushong, both pangolins are regarded as symbols offertility and considered 'royal animals', linked with kingship and power, but the stress is again preferentially on Manis tricuspis (Vansina 1964: 109-10). Elsewhere in the Congo, and indeed throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, there are indications that pangolins are often endowed with mystical (often therapeutic) power and thus treated as rather special animals. They are not, however, universally subject to food taboos. In some parts of Africa, they are just good to eat.</page><page sequence="9">I.M. LEWIS 521 VI From this limited and patchy material on these variable ritual preferences, I think we can conclude that if the basis of the pangolin's ritual salience is its (classificatory) anomalousness, then clearly the small pangolin could hardly be intrinsically more anomalous than the large pangolin. Indeed, since evidently either can be selected for cultic preference by different ethnic groups and cultures in the same general region (Congo), it would also seem unlikely that anomalousness is the crucial attribute favouring preferential ritual attention. Indeed, more generally, we may question whether anomalousness is a sufficient and necessary condition for pangolin power. Let us, then, return to look more closely at Douglas's own Lele material. What is it actually that empowers the pangolin? The answer seems quite clear in her data and, paradoxically, in the way in which Douglas herself presents them. The pangolin's scaly body and fish-like tail link it with the aquatic domain where, for the Lele, 'fishes, water-animals and water-plants as well as amphibians - are associated with the spirits and with fertility' (Douglas 1957: 50). At the same time, the link with fertility is given a further twist, as we have seen, by the pangolin's habit of mono-reproduction linking it directly with humankind.6 According to Douglas, a further link with humans is indicated by the pangolin's practice of not trying to escape when hunted, but curling up into a scaly ball, suggesting that it virtually offers itself up sacrificially to the hunter.7 In relation to these specific and positive connexions which make the pangolin's role completely comprehensible, the emphasis Douglas places on the animal's alleged anomalousness seems something of a red herring, and is perhaps a con- sequence of her interest in the biblical abominations which she weaves into her discussion of the pangolin. The fact that the scaly ant-eater manifestly straddles, and so fruitfully links, such different dimensions as animal-kind, spirits and humans is not in question. But, in my view, these are better seen as providing a series of positive (if lateral) relationships rather than combining to constitute a mysterious anomaly, demanding solution. Of course, the pangolin may seem anomalous to the Lele, but this is not convincingly documented in the evidence presented. Similarly, Douglas offers no evidence at all for her entirely speculative and rather far-fetched assertion that, in their pangolin ritual, Lele initiates 'confront the categories on which the whole surrounding culture has been built up... and recognise them for the fictive, man-made, arbitrary creations that they are' (Douglas 1966: 169-70; see also Douglas 1990 and Willis 1975). In fact, although Douglas emphasises anomaly (perhaps influenced by the as- sumed biblical parallels), her presentation of the mediatory role of the pangolin in Lele ideology is actually rather convincingly contextualised in terms of her dis- cussion of the Lele cosmology. As she says, while Lele associate fish with spirits, fish in themselves do not 'bridge the gap between human society and the creatures of the forest'. But 'pangolins, part fish, part animal, friendly to humans, are apt for a mediatory role' (Douglas 1957: 52). Criticisms of her Lele argument on these contextual grounds thus seems wide of the mark. Douglas's line of thought here has been taken a step further by de Heusch (1964; 1971), who suggests quite reasonably that the pangolins in the Lele forest are the counterparts of the initiated Pangolin Cult Men in the village, an antithesis which he predictably sees as part of that between 'Nature' and 'Culture'.</page><page sequence="10">522 I.M. LEWIS As has been pointed out elsewhere, however, Douglas's more general treatment of the concept of taxonomic anomaly is highly problematic, not to say flawed, since as a rule taxonomies do not, as she seems to imply, necessarily generate perceived anomalies in an unproblematic way (see e.g. Bulmer 1967; Needham 1976; Sperber 1976; Ellen 1972), and she does not confront the difficulties posed by the existence of logically different levels and types of anomaly (see Ohnuki- Tiemey 1980; 1981). But this takes us beyond the scope of the present discussion. Here I have simply tried to show that, although in the anthropological (and derived sociological) literature, the pangolin has itself ironically become a symbol for anomaly,8 its actual mystical significance for the Lele does not in fact seem to derive from this negative taxonomic status, but stems rather from its varied, positive and multidimensional properties which link it directly and comprehensively with human, animal and spirit-kind. Its powers seem to flow from these literally per- ceived attributes, linking it to several cosmological domains. I think that this is also probably broadly true for the other African cultures where the pangolin is treated as ritually powerful. All this, of course, refers to pangolins in general and does not discriminate, as the Lele and some other peoples evidently do, between the small and large pangolin. Unlike the position in tarantism as regards the distinction between Lycosa and Latrodectus, here both pangolins are acknowledged by the Lele as sacred, spirit animals, but with major cult activity reserved to the small pangolin. The Ba Lega in the eastern Congo also regard both pangolins as sacred, but reverse tne order of ritual precedence. For their part, the Komo revere only the large pangolin, discounting Manis tricuspis altogether. The Bushong, in turn, have the same pangolin preferences as the Lele. Beyond the fact, as I would argue, that the pangolin offers a powerful genenc bridging, or conjunctive, symbol, what can we make of these contrasting cultural preferences? I would suggest that the preferential emphasis placed by the Lele on Manis tricuspis may reflect the importance of the 'forest' in Lele cosmology (cf. Douglas 1954; 1963), since tricuspis is arboreal. This would seem also to explain the similar tncuspis preference of the neighbouring Bushong (cf. Vansina, personal communication). The Komo, in contrast, pair their ritually powerful pangolin with the crocodile, linking it also with fish, and thus appear to associate it more strongly with the water than with the wooded forest. Hence, if this argument is correct, they select the non-arboreal Manis gigantea for special attention. The parallel Lega preference, linked with the ritual significance of the crocodile and a local fish species, suggests that the Lega follow the Komo in emphasising the pangolin's association with water: hence they also place greater emphasis on the non-arborealgigantea - which can swim - than on the tree-climbing tricuspis. These differences, in turn, seem to reflect varying weightings in these cultures' cosmolo- gies between forest and water as spirit abodes. These hypotheses can, of course, only be properly tested by more detailed empirical research. Here, as in the case of the two tarantula spiders, such work would exploit the opportunities for enhanced insight into the symbolisation process afforded by the parallel existence of two (or more) potentially appropriate members of the same zoological family. More immediately, a further comment on Douglas's ideas seems in order. Writing later and more theoretically, Douglas (1975: 306 sqq.) attempts to develop the concepts of negative and positive anomaly, and claims to find correlations</page><page sequence="11">I.M. LEWIS 523 between these and social structure. Thus, she contrasts the negative animal abom- inations of the ancient Israelites with the Lele pangolin. The formner, negative evaluation correlates, she asserts, with a generally negative view of exchange, evidenced in the Israelite stress on endogamy. The Lele, who have a positive view of external exchange and practise exogamy, consequently treat the pangolin as a positive anomaly. Whatever may be thought of the Old Testament evidence, the linkage postulated here between exogamy and positive pangolin power is not borne out by the data on the Ba Lega whose clans are not exogamous (Biebuyck 1953: 903). Moreover the character of Lele social structure itself is, on this point, somewhat problematic. De Heusch (1971: 62 sqq.) who has elegantly re-analysed Douglas's material, contends that Lele villages, which are the principal social units, are in fact endogamous.9 Finally, there is the difficulty posed by the claim that, on account of their alleged open-armed approach to exchange (however problematic their 'exogamy'), Lele have a generally positive attitude towards 'anomalies'. This might seem to fit the Lele pangolin (primarily, of course, Manis tricuspis) but it certainly does not fit such evidently negative anomalies as the 'baboon, the scaly tail, the tortoise and other animal anomalies [which] are to the Lele as the camel, the hare and the rock badger to the ancient Hebrews' (Douglas 1957: 50). Douglas does not explain why, according to her interpretation, the pangolin should be so favoured, while these other Lele animal 'anomalies' fail to enjoy the benefits she attributes to Lele exogamy. NOTES I am most grateful to the following colleagues for advice and help in prepanng this article: Phil Bumham, William A. Christian Jnr, Dick Hayward, Gustav Jahoda, Brian Morris, Emiko Ohnuki- Tiemey, Johnny Parry, Paul Richards, Isaac Schapera and Jan Vansina. For helpful comments on an earlier version, thanks are also due to Man's anonymous reviewers. 1 Thus, for example, Hadfield (1969: 193-4) claims that the spider as a symbol, with its soft squashy body and projecting limbs, is an objectification of the soft-nauseating feelings produced after an orgasm, starting in the solar plexus and spreading out to the other parts of the abdomen and body like the legs of the spider. 2 According to Biebuyck (1953) there are in fact three varieties of pangolin in this area of the Congo, but only two - Manis tricuspis and Manisgigantea - are common. 3 See the article 'Pangolin' in Haltenorth &amp; Diller (1980). 4 Thus, according to de Heusch, Lega pangolin symbolism is driven by sociological forces, whereas among the Lele 'cosmogonic' determinants select the small pangolin in preference to the large pangolin. This seems a quite arbitrary analytical judgement for which no convincing justifica- tion is offered. A more satisfactory line of explanation would seek determining factors of the same order (sociological or cosmological) in each case. Thus, as I argue below, the varying prominence of the two pangolins in the Congolese societies discussed in this article may reflect cosmological differences in these cultures (see also Zuesse 1979). 5 This assertion seems to contradict the Komo classification of the small and large pangolins with the porcupine, Gambian rat and the aardvark as 'burrowing animals' (de Mahieu 1980: 36) within the class of quadrupeds. 6 The pangolin's anthropomorphic links are also acknowledged by the Ma'Betisek, a Malay aboriginal group, but in a slightly different way. In this case, the pangolin (Manisjavanica) is said to have been formed from human after-births. The after-birth is buried in the ground wrapped in a mat which is considered to resemble the pangolin's scales (Begum Karim 1981: 48). 7 In fact, the pangolin's reaction, like the hedgehog's, is defensive and is accompanied by the emission of an unpleasant smell.</page><page sequence="12">524 I.M. LEWIS 8 In his short monograph on Sotho cosmology, citing Douglas, Hammond-Tooke (1981: 133-4) similarly explains the mystical properties of the local pangolin (Manis teminckii - which has the same habits as Manis gigantea, the pangolin which is not ritually prominent among the Lele!). 'Few ani- mals' he states 'can be as anomalous as the pangolin. It is a four legged, claw-footed mammal, but it is covered with scales like a fish, looks like a reptile and bears its young singly as humans usually do'. With these diverse characteristics, the pangolin has an 'anomalous position' in the local system of zoological classification and hence is endowed with 'tremendous power'. In the absence of other evidence (for example on linkages with spirits), this explains, according to Hammond-Tooke, the prominence of the pangolin as a kind of royal game to be handed over to a chief if killed in hunting by a commoner, and as a source of chiefly medicine. It so happens that the name of the tribe studied here also means pangolin, but Hammond-Tooke says that this is 'fortuitous'. Similarly (if more in accordance with my emphasis on its positive power) among the Sherbo, MacCormack argues that 'the pangolin is highly anomalous in terms of Sherbo thought categories, and is therefore a powerful symbol of mediation between the categories... it mediates the three cosmological tiers, from deep ancestral water to the sky which trees penetrate'. The pangolin in question here is Manis tricuspis (MacCormack 1980: 116). 9 Admission to the prestigious Lele Pangolin cult is restricted to men of one of the founding clans of the village, with fathers also from a founding clan, and with wives belonging to a founding clan. Thus the pangolin seems to be tightly associated with local endogamy rather than with exogamy as Douglas claims (see also de Heusch 1985: 36). REFERENCES Begum Karim, WJ. 1981.

L'araigne'e et le pangolin Resume Dans le culte de tarantisme de l'Italie meridionale, il y a deux types d'araignees 'tarantulas' reelles avec lesquelles l'espn't araignee peut etre identifie, mais une seulement est choisie comme equivalente a l'esprit. En examinant la base ici de la selection du symbole, la reference est aussi faite au symbolisme du pangolin Lele oiu il y a en fait a nouveau deux especes de pangolins locaux, auquel a un seulement un culte est rendu. L'analyse classique de Mary Douglas des 'anomalies' animales echoue a s'attaquer a ce probleme. Dans le contexte d'une comparaison de la ritualisation du pangolin dans d'autres cultures congolaises, la critique suivante de Mary Douglas du traitement des 'anomalies' du pangolin suggere une solution cosmologique a ce mystere. La tentative de Douglas de correler le pouvoir du pangolin avec l'exogamie est aussi montree etre discutable. Plus generale- ment, il est argumente que la oui deux ou plus d'animaux apparentes sont sujets a la symbolisation differentielle, une interpretation satisfaisante devrait expliquer pourquoi un est choisi pour l'attention ntuelle pr6f6rentielle.
