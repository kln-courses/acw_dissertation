<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spinoza GEORGE ELIOT, GEORGE HENRY LEWES AND SPINOZA'S TRACTATUS THEOLOGICO-POLITICUS by THOMAS DEEGAN Saint Xavier University The story of George Eliot's extensive involvement with Spinoza's Tractatus needs to be told. It reveals new information about her close interest in, and translation of, Spinoza's two principal works, the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus and the Ethics, during two separate periods - the 1840's and the mid-1850's, culminating in a failed attempt in 1856 by Lewes and Eliot to publish English translations of these works. Further, it reveals how extensively George Henry Lewes was involved in this Spinoza translation project, which stemmed from their shared interest in Spinoza and which began for each of them long before they met George Eliot's holograph ms. translation of Spinoza's Ethics (Eliot IV, 11) is housed in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. Together with her Ethics ms. in the same folder is a nine-page Lewes holograph ms. titled "Notes and Additions to the Theologico-PoliticalTractate."1 The Beinecke Ethics folder contents are in the following order. Nine leaves: "Notes and Additions to the Theologico- Political Tractate" in Lewes's hand. One leaf: "Introduction and Spinoza's Ethics Part I"; half- title in Lewes's hand. (The ms. folder contains no introduction.) 654 leaves: the complete Ethics translation in five parts. George Eliot holograph except that each of the five parts is preceded by a divisional title leaf. These five divisional titles are in Lewes's hand. These folder contents are written on alternate lines of lined notebook paper, recto only, except for occasional insertions on verso. The leaves measure 19 x 32 cm. and consist of several -</page><page sequence="2">Spinoza different kinds of paper. This is clearly at least part of the Spinoza material which Lewes sent to Henry Bohn in 1856 for publication in Bohn's Philosophical Library. Lewes's ms. contains 23 notes. Thirteen of them are translations from the Latin of selected Spinoza notes in the Tractatus ; 10 are Lewes's own cross-references to passages in the Ethics. The presence of this ms. immediately raises several questions. Why is this apparently fragmentary piece by Lewes placed at the front of George Eliot's 1854-56 Ethics translation? Why does Lewes translate only 13 of Spinoza's 33 notes? To what English translation of the Tractatus does it refer? To what George Eliot's Tractatus translation which she labored on in the 1840's? Is this indeed Lewes's translation or George Eliot's? The story of Lewes's disagreement with Bohn in June 1856 regarding the terms for publishing a translation of Spinoza's major works has been told by Haight and others.2 In 1853 Lewes published with Bohn his Comte's Philosophy of the Sciences. At that time or in 1854 Lewes made a verbal arrangement with Bohn to provide English translations of Spinoza's Tractatus and Ethics. Lewes told Bohn that the translations would be made by a man named Kelly, with the editing and an introduction by Lewes (G.H.L. to Bohn, 8 June 1856, GEL 8:158). Haight says that "Kelly soon abandoned the difficult task" and George Eliot took it up ( GE 199). "Kelty," though, was probably a pseudonym for George Eliot, and they planned their Spinoza collaboration from the outset No one has ever presented any evidence of Kelly's existence; Haight probably took Lewes's word at face value. But knowing Eliot and Lewes's living arrangement at this time and her desire for anonymily, we can understand Lewes's maneuver. Further, we now know that George Eliot and Lewes were already intimate friends before Lewes arranged with Bohn to publish Spinoza. Bohn, writing to Lewes on 7 June 1856, estimated that their initial agreement was "two or three years ago," and his 18 June 1856 letter refers to Lewes's "delay of two years in producing your volume," thus placing their agreement around June 1854 or, at the earliest, June 1853. Lewes and Eliot met 6 October 1851 and were friends during 1852. After a very close scrutiny of existing evidence, Ashton concludes that they probably became lovers during the winter of 1852-53 and that in August 1853 Lewes was already thinking of going to Berlin with Eliot (139, 143). She had already translated part of the 2</page><page sequence="3">Spinoza Tractatus, and Lewes, who had translated part of the Ethics, was the leading English authority on Spinoza. So it is unlikely that a man named Kelly would be required. Eliot could not begin the Spinoza translation for Bohn immediate^ because, from June 1853 until July 18S4, she was busy with the Feuerbach translation. She did begin the Ethics as soon as practicable, though, when they had settled in Berlin in November 1854, finishing it by February 19, 1856. When Lewes presented the Spinoza mss. to Bohn in May 1856, he maintained that their earlier agreement specified payment of £50 for the translation by Kelly and £25 for his own editing. According to Bohn, though, "the sum in my mind has always been fifty pounds, the same as Comte" for the whole project (Bohn to G.H.L., 7 June 1856, GEL 8:156-57). A second area of disagreement specifically involved the Tractatus. Bohn expected new Tractatus and Ethics translations. In the same letter he wrote: "If half the volume is to be a mere reprint of the old translation, which I never contemplated, I can see no reason why the cost of the editing should be more than Comte." Lewes replied: "the reprint of the old translation was agreed on by us, and you gave me the volume for that purpose. The only difference being that if my Introduction and extracts from the other works occupied too great a space, it was not to be printed entire, but some portions of it abridged" (G.H.L. to Bohn, 8 June 1856, GEL 8:157-58). Bohn replied: "I never for a moment dreamt of your reprinting the old translation," and rejects the notion of an abridgement of the Tractatus, "for I detest abridgements* (Bohn to G.H.L., 13 June 1856, GEL 8:159). After this, Lewes rashly cancelled the arrangement "I beg you will send back my m.s. and consider the whole business at an end between us" (G.H.L. to Bohn, 15 June 1856, GEL 8:159). The returned ms. or what remains of it, is the one in the Beinecke collection which I described above. Both Lewes and Eliot are maddeningly silent about this whole affair. We can, though, detect her frustration about "the uncertain process of letter-writing" in a letter to Mrs. Peter Taylor written on 8 June, the same day as Lewes's letter to Bohn: "I have suffered so much from misunderstanding created by letters.... Some little phrase or allusion is misinterpreted, and on this false basis a great fabric of misconception is reared, which even explanatory conversations will not remove" (2:254). The "old translation" which Bohn had lent to Lewes, and 3</page><page sequence="4">Spinoza which Lewes in turn surprised him by tendering for reprinting, is a 1689 English translation of the Tractatus titled A Treatise Partly Theological, and Partly Political , London. This edition lists no publisher, no translator; not even Spinoza as author. It is a complete and accurate translation of the Tractatus, but as Bohn objected, it is an "antiquated text" needing modernization of the English. Lewes's page references in his "Notes and Additions" ms. consistently refer to this translation. Further, the text of this translation lacks Spinoza's notes. So it is clear, Srst, that Lewes acting as editor decided to supply this translation of the notes from a Latin edition of Spinoza's works; and second, that his translation of only 13 of the 33 notes indicates that he was indeed tendering to Bohn an abridgement of the 1689 translation, accompanied by his translated notes and cross- references to that abridgement But why didn't Lewes use George Eliot's Tractatus translation? We must examine the chronology specific to her Tractatus translation to shed light on this question. First, I want to argue that she began to translate the Tractatus in 1843, a matter over which biographers have expressed a good deal of uncertainty.3 I agree with Haight's later belief that she began to read Dr. Brabant's copy of Spinoza4 in or around January 1843, began translating the Tractatus for Charles Bray in that same month, and continued this translation in 1847-49 ( GEL l:158n). She interrupted this 1843 translation for over two years, from January 1844 until April 1846, when she turned to the Strauss translation. When she returned to translating Spinoza in February 1847, she requested the same Latin edition that she had translated from in 1843. When Sara Hennell delayed sending her Dr. Brabant's copy, she wrote: "ask Mr. Chapman to get me a copy of the same edition if possible - Mind, I really want this" (G.E. to Sara Hennell, 28 February 1847, GEL 1:231-32). She will eventually identify this translation as the Tractatus (GE to Sara Hennell, 18 April 1849, GEL 1:280). Further evidence that she began the Tractatus in 1843 is found in the Spinozistic phrases and ideas specifically from both the Tractatus and the Ethics which begin to appear in her letters. These allusions confirm that she was being influenced by Spinoza in 1843 and possibly a few months earlier. In a letter to Sara Hennell George Eliot asserts the peculiarly Spinozistic doctrine that "to choose unmixed evil is impossible to the human mind" (3 November 1842, GEL 1:151). In his Ethics Spinoza asserts: "If the human mind 4</page><page sequence="5">Spinoza had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil" ( Ethics , G.E. trans. 201). In her 9 October 1843 letter to Sara Hennell she repeats Spinoza's exhortation in the Tractatus: "We must part with the crutches of superstition. Are we to go on cherishing superstitions out of a fear that seems inconsistent with any faith in a Supreme Being? ... We cannot fight and struggle enough for freedom of enquiry" (GEL 1:162). According to Spinoza, the free exercise of reason and inquiry will release us from the "shackles of superstition," which "is engendered, preserved, and fostered by fear" ( Tractatus , Elwes trans. 4). Sara Hennell, describing George Eliot's new views in October 1843, reveals how her friend has been influenced by Spinoza's Tractatus: "She said she considered the Bible a revelation in a certain sense, as she considered herself a revelation of the mind of the Deity" (GEL 1:163). Spinoza argues in both the Tractatus and the Ethics that God is revealed to man, not through the revelations of Scripture, but through man's mind as a manifestation of the mind of God. "Hence it follows that the human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God. And accordingly, when we say that the human mind perceives this or that, we say nothing else than that God ... has this or that idea ... in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind" (Ethics, G.E. trans. 52). Eliot continued her Tractatus translation, then, from February 1847 probably until May 1849, when her father died, and she apparently abandoned it for good. On 4 December 1849 she informed the Brays: "Spinoza and I have been divorced for many months" (G.E. to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bray, GEL 1:321). If they insisted, she could finish the Tractatus translation for publication by John Chapman within a few months. Comparing her rate of progress in translating the Ethics, her statement would suggest that she had by now completed over half of the Tractatus. But she never again mentions this translation. The question still remains: in 1856 why did Lewes use the printed 1689 Tractatus translation instead of hers? She and Lewes were now collaborating fully on the Spinoza project for Bohn, and she was certainly party to this decision. Since her desire to publish her translation anonymously was her normal preference,5 her silence here does not suggest that Lewes was acting without her knowledge, as David Williams claims (166). She allowed Lewes to handle this 5</page><page sequence="6">Spinoza entire affair with Bohn, just as she would continue to do with her business affairs during Lewes's lifetime. In speculating about George Eliot's missing Tractatus ms., we might consider whether, when she abandoned the translation in 1849, she gave it to the Brays. In 1843 when George Eliot first took up the Tractatus translation, Mrs. Bray had also wanted to do it' Now in 18SS, newly returned to England and living with Lewes, her strained relationship with Mrs. Bray may have prevented her from asking for it However, though her friendship with the Brays had cooled during the 1855-56 period to the extent that she wasn't invited to Rosehill, she still seemed to be on friendly enough terms with them, especially with Mr. Bray, to get her ms. back. The mss. of her published Strauss and Feuerbach translations have not survived either. Could she have considered the unfinished Tractatus ms. disposable? "Pray consider the Strauss M.S.S. waste paper. / shall never want them again" (G.E. to Mrs. Bray, 3 July 1854, GEL 2:163). At any rate, we must conclude that the Tractatus translation which she had labored on in the 1840's was either now unavailable to her or so brief and unfinished as not to be usable for the Bohn project Either she and Lewes had planned from the outset to use the 1689 translation when they borrowed it from Bohn, perhaps then learning of its existence, or, pressed for time as they were in 1856 to earn income, they then turned to it Questions also remain regarding the missing introduction listed on the first leaf of the Ethics ms. and identified by Lewes to Bohn as "my Introduction." I have compared Lewes's 1846 edition of the Biographical History of Philosophy with his revised 1857 edition and later reprints to see whether he might have used it later in the revised Spinoza chapters. The 1857 revisions show, indeed, that he made use of George Eliot's Ethics translation, but there is no evidence of the missing introduction. He substantially revised his 1846 translation of the early sections of the Ethics, drawing language from George Eliot's ms. Even more extensive is his transfer verbatim from George Eliot's ms. of a 53-line passage from Spinoza's Appendix to Part I on man's anthropomorphic tendency to judge the infinite by finite knowledge (Ethics, G.E. trans. 35:1- 36:13). Lewes does not cite the source of these revisions.7 We may now turn to the "Notes and Additions" ms., which I have determined to be Lewes's translation made with George 6</page><page sequence="7">Spinoza Eliot's full knowledge. I base this judgment admittedly on a small amount of internal evidence, yet I can find nothing to support a conclusion that this is Eliot's work. The ms. is definitely in his hand, and the language of the text suggests his translating style rather than hers. The translator omits several Hebrew passages in the translation of notes 1 and 18, and avoids two Spinoza notes in ch. 9, which contain extensive Hebrew passages (Brader ed., 138 fn2; 139 fh2). These omissions suggest Lewes, who did not have George Eliot's knowledge of Hebrew.8 The rendering of Spinoza's percipi as "included" in note 4a corresponds to Lewes's same rendering of that word in his 1843 Westminster Review partial Ethics translation (Part I, Axiom 4, 390). Eliot renders it as "implied* in her Ethics translation (3). Spinoza's admiratione is rendered as "astonishment" in note 14, whereas Eliot consistently renders it as "wonder" ( Ethics , G.E. trans. Part III, Prop. 52 schoL, 130; and Def. 4 of the emotions, 140). Lewes introduced Spinoza to the English speaking world and into the main stream of philosophy through his clear explications of the philosopher's system - first in an 1842 Penny Cyclopaedia article; then in an 1843 Westminster Review article, which he later incorporated into his chapters on Spinoza's life and doctrine in his Biographical History of Philosophy, 1845-46. He included a translation of early sections of the Ethics in all these expositions of Spinoza's system. Although he was just as attracted as Eliot was to Spinoza's Biblical criticism in the Tractatus, he writes almost solely on Spinoza's metaphysics, epistemology and ethics in the Ethics. The Spinoza edition he bought in 1836 (the Opera Posthuma ), from which he immediately began to translate, and which he used for these Ethics translations, might have influenced this direction.9 It contains the Ethics but not the Tractatus. Lewes admired the 1803 Paulus edition of the complete works (BHP, 1846 ed., 3: 154n) but did not use it for his 1856 "Notes and Additions" translation. Instead, he used Carl Brudeťs Spinoza Opera Quae Supersunt Omnia, 3 vols., 1843-46; the Tractatus printed in voL 3, 1846. In 1856, Bruder's was the most recent and most scholarly edition, and, after it appeared, Lewes declared it superior to Paulus (BHP, 1857 ed., 2:492n). George Eliot also used Bruder as the primary text for her Ethics translation in 1854-56. It is difficult to judge what the shape of Lewes's abridgement of the 1689 English translation might have been, 7</page><page sequence="8">Spinoza judging only from what we have: Lewes's 13 translated notes of Spinoza's 33 and Lewes's 10 cross-references to the Ethics. Since almost half of Spinoza's chapters contain no notes (ch. 2,4,5,12, 13,14,18,20), we cannot determine whether Lewes included them or not Of Spinoza's 20 chapters, Lewes omits translating Spinoza's notes, or making cross-references to the Ethics, from ch. 8,9,15,19, and parts of ch. 10,16 and 17. Lewes's cross-references to the Ethics occur in groups; Le., notes 2,3,5 in ch. 1; notes 6,7 in ch. 3; notes 8,9,10,11 in ch. 4; note 19 in ch. 16. They deal with Spinoza's concept of God as the infinite first cause of all existence including man's understanding. Note 19 refers to Ethics, Part IV, "On the Power of the Intellect or on Human Liberty." I can generalize that Lewes tends to omit Spinoza's detailed account of Judaic history and authorship of individual books of Scripture, while he includes Spinoza's line of argument throughout the Tractatus. Though he only translates 40% of Spinoza's notes, I believe he included a larger portion of Spinoza's text, since he would have included some of the chapters in which Spinoza did not write notes. In the text that follows I supply in brackets page references to the Brader Latin edition. "Ed." is Lewes. His consistent use of "Sp. M.S." to designate his translations of Spinoza's notes is curious since his page references are to the 1689 published translation. I wish to thank Jonathan G.

Nor can they give any better reason for maintaining that the decrees of this great synagogue or synod, frequented solely by the Pharisees, were made by the prophet who received them from elder prophets, &amp; so on up to Moses who received them from God himself. This is the doctrine of the Pharisees, but those who know why the councils &amp; synods were assembled, &amp; are acquainted with the controversies of the Pharisees &amp; Sadducees will easily divine the cause why this great synagogue was convoked.

As to the divine natural law whose highest precept is that we should love God, I call it a law in the sense used by philosophers who call thus those universal rules according to which eveiy thing is produced in nature. For the love of God is not obedience, but a virtue which is necessarily in every man who rightly knows God. But obedience relates to the will of a governor, &amp; not to the necessity &amp; truth of things. And as on the one hand we are ignorant of the will of God, &amp; on the other we are certain that every thing which occurs occurs through his power, it follows that only Revelation can tell us whether God means to receive certain homage from men as if he were a Prince. Add to this, that, as we have proved, divine commandments appear to us as laws &amp; institutions only so long as we are ignorant of their cause; but as soon as we know them they appear to us as eternal truths, &amp; obedience becomes love of God, love which rises necessarily from knowledge, as light issues from the sun. Reason therefore bads us to love God, but it cannot teach us to obey him; for on the one hand we cannot understand the commandments of God as divine so long as we are ignorant of their cause, &amp; on the other we cannot conceive God as a Prince instituting laws." Sp. M.S. [Bruder 3:216] Note 21 p 366 "In this passage it is said that two men were prophecying in the camp and Joshua thought they ought to be arrested; which he would not have done if every one had the right of preaching to the people the divine words without the permission of Moses. But Moses was pleased to absolve the criminals &amp; reproached Joshua for urging him to use his regal power at a time when that power was a burden to him, &amp; when he would rather die -</page><page sequence="16">Spinoza than reign alone, as appears from v.14 of this chapter. Thus he replied to Joshua Enviest thou for mv sake? Would God that all the lords poppte were propter &amp; thç Lo^ would pm M? spirit upon them. Thus therefore Joshua was not ignorant of the right of Moses, but was mistaken as to the opportunity of its exercise; &amp; for this Moses reproved him." Sp. M.S. [Bruder 3:227] Note 22 p 368 "The interpreters of Scripture wrongly translate the verses 19 and 23, as it seems to me. For the verses do not mean that Moses gave precepts or advice to Joshua but that he created or constituted him a Prince; a form of language frequent in Scripture; as Exodus cl8 v23. 1 Samuel cl3. vl4. Joshua cl v9. and I Samuel c25. v30. Sp. M.S. - [Bruder 3:228] NOTES 1. Bruder: "R. Salomo Jarchi." Rashi, an acronym of Rabbi Solomon Yitzhaqi (Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac) of Troyes (1040-1105).
