And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Come let us make brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, Come let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name — lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language — and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. Come, let us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city. Therefore was the name of it called Babel ; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth; and from • An abstract of parts of this paper was published in the Psychoan alytic Review . . .

Genesis XI, 1-9. The Holy Bible, American Standard Version. Preliminary Considerations The suggestive power of the Bible myth of the Tower of Babel reflects an important feeling man has had about himself throughout the ages. It is but an expression of psychological truth in ancient garb. God, the father, took away from his children one language in order to punish them for attempting to be as powerful as he, and so took from</page><page sequence="3">79 them unity, harmony and lasting peace. The myth suggests that different languages create misunderstandings, destroy cooperation, make for differences that may even lead to war and destruction. The survival of any literary product seems ample proof that the human problem it touched upon has not been solved, that the feeling it expresses is as true today as it has been throughout the ages. The Bible myth lends itself even today to a projection of our conflicts and problems, our feelings of guilt, and our yearning for unity and peaceful coopera tion. Most nations conquering another group used to force upon it their own language. Defeated groups try by all means, and in spite of all danger, to hold on to their mother tongue. Immigrants in America who seek approval and ac ceptance are required to pass a language test, implying that a knowledge of English guarantees loyalty. The slogan one language seems to be the foundation for the formation of one united nation. People who speak another language arouse our hostility as strangers. The spreading of one's language is considered a kind of victory. One language seems to be the first step towards one world. A prime minister advocated the adoption of Basic English as an important step towards world unity. International languages directed towards the same end have been suggested by a former First Lady, by well-known commentators, by many different groups. The Esperanto movement after the first World War attracted many workers. A good many other efforts such as the crea tion of the new language Interglossa have commanded atten tion. The idea in back of all this seems to be that unity, peace and love must be based on understanding, and understand ing is seen as a problem of language. Only persons who understand each other, who talk the "same language" can work out their problems, their conflicts, in peace and through cooperation. The Tower of Babel, symbol of security, of power, of the fulfiilmet of man's dreams and longings can be completed only if men talk one language. He who con</page><page sequence="4">80 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. founds their language destroys their dreams of omnipotence. He divides them but to retain his own. The patient but sophisticated reader may have accum ulated at this point sufficient annoyance at this apparent over-simplification and distortion of true relationships that he will be ready to voice very justified objections. He Will call to our attention the fact that language habits are not the cause but the effect of difference. It is not the language that creates difference but the difference that makes for modi fications in language patterns. It seems then that the one who attempts to achieve the general use of one language for all in order to bring them together, in order to alleviate friction and destruction, really removes the symptom rather than the cause. One may assume though that the advocates of one language are aware of this and use their battlecry for the new language as a kind of slogan which is the symbolic expression of more serious, deeper-reaching efforts in social engineering. The myth of the Tower of Babel seems to overestimate the power of language if taken literally rather than in its symbolic meaning. One is reminded of Sigmund Freud's Allmacht der Gedanken, the omnipotence of thought, which is an expression one of his neurotic patients used to describe the infantile feeling the emotionally ill attach to the delusion that words and thoughts are all-powerful and stronger than reality. The child believes in the magic of words and thoughts as does the primitive and the neurotic. 1) It is as if they deny certain aspects of reality, while the psychotic denies all of reality other than his own fantasy, his own thoughts; it is as if language rules absolutely although it has lost to a large degree its true function of normal comuni cation. While we are all aware that the function of language ■ is communication with fellow men, we realize that at times the intricacies of the tool prevent genuine communication and we understand also the age-old yearning for a restora tion of the power man is said to have had before the days of his dream of omnipotence by means of the Tower of Babel.</page><page sequence="5">81 The statesmen and public commentators are not the only ones who seem to follow the illusion that peace eould be created were we to adopt one language. Students of language are similarly inclined. Very creative and con structive efforts of semanticists follow the same pattern of overestimation of language. We would like to quote S. I. Hayakawa in Language in Action: "It will be the thesis of this book that disagree ments of this kind — fundamental, doctrinal agree ments which seem to admit of no solution — are due not to stupidity or stubbornness, not even to an un scientific attitude towards the problems involved, but to an unscientific attitude towards language itself. In fact, a number of apparently insoluble problems which face us in our personal lives, in our society, and our politics and it must be remembered that the prob lems are formulated in words — may prove to be not insoluble at all when viewed through a clearer know ledge of the workings of language. It will .be the pur pose of this book, therefore, not only to acquaint the reader with some elementary facts about language such as are revealed by modern linguistics, anthropolo gy, psychology, philosophy, literary criticism, and other branches of learning, but also to change his very at titude towards language." 2) "Why is the world a mess?", is one of the questions S. I. Hayakawa asks and his answer seems to be the following : "But to the extent that we too think like savages and babble like idiots, we all share the guilt for the mess in which human society finds itself. To cure these evils, we must first go to work on ourselves. An im portant beginning step is to understand how language works, what we are doing when we open these irre sponsible mouths of ours, and what it is that happens, or should happen, when we listen or read." 3)</page><page sequence="6">82 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. It may be well that quotations such as the ones above are not to be taken literally, but have to be understood in terms of their educational intentions. The efforts of Wen dell Johnson 4) or of Alfred Korzybsky 5) seem to indicate at times that these authors too see language difficulties re sulting in language confusion as the root of certain social and emotional problems. Does Korzybsky really believe that semantic enlightenment will help the schizophrenic pa tient to give up his delusions and to return to sanity, i.e., to a sound use of words? It is not only upon the realm of politics, of peace en deavors, or of propaganda in psychological warefare, on advertisement, or on psychological help that the tower of Babel has cast its shadow. In science, too, efforts are made to achieve a unity of science through unity of language, to use once more some of the semantic slogans. The effort is made to clarify language, to "translate" one theory into the other, to unite different branches of science through clarification. Semantic effort turns its interest to different philosophical doctrines, to different ideologies, and in its efforts — perhaps out of understandable Narcissism — seems to "overlook" that it works on symptoms rather than on causes. 6) The efforts of the creators of a Basic English, Esperanto, or Interglossa, of the ones who hope to achieve a unity of science, or those who seem to assume that psy chotics or neurotics can be cured if their semantic confusion is dealt with, all these efforts remind one of the family doctor of horse and buggy days who worked to bring down fever through the appliance of cold and wet sheets, not having realized that the fever is the symptom which tries to fight the infection, the true cause of the illness. The differences in language may be looked upon as a symptom, and we know that every symptom, whether somatic or psychic in origin, serves a function. The authors intend to look at language not only in an abstract manner and thus consider it merely as a tool of communication which needs to be sharpened — their intent</page><page sequence="7">The Tower of Babel— 83 is also to look at language in its cultural setting and to try to understand the use of a particular language as a symptom for conflicts and difficulties that are inherent in the culture. We look at language, then, not only with a semantic but also with a social and psychological point of view. Culture itself, even if it is our own, our accepted cul ture, can be understood as if it were a psychological symptom which will cause us to look for the inner and deep conflicts creating it. Such a point of view has been suggested by Paul Shilder. 7) Religious systems and dogmas have been studied along such lines, 8) and a similar effort has been made in order to understand political ideologies. 9) As we shall later see and understand much better, any effort of science to understand, to explain, to gain insight, to arrive at clarification is countered with hostility because it is experienced as danger, as attack. It is as if the semantic clarification, the psychological explanation, the sociological causes we may find debunk the phenomenon under scrutiny. It seems sto the writers that this too stems from the illusion man has about the power of language. Even Freud during the formative years of psychoanalysis succumbed to that illusion in assuming that the mere intellectual understand ing of the hysterical symptom will make the symptom dis appear. Behind this is the assumption that symptoms can be explained away, that they can be debunked; and it is because of this strong feling in man that efforts at scientific progress arouse anxiety in many, and arouse passions against the new that is experienced as danger. It is useful then to recall Freud's comments as to the injury of man's self esteem when he had to face new concepts as expressed in the theories of Copernicus, Darwin, and of Freud himself. One may understand one's own attitude but that does not necessarily mean one must give it up. Some of the dark fears people experience when considering or commencing their own analysis are tied up with the idea that the inter pretation, the explanation of the analyst will effect uncon</page><page sequence="8">84 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. trollable and undesirable changes. "Everything will be an alyzed away" expresses this attitude. It is not without psychological intent that these prelim inary lines have been written. Their function is to prepare the psychologist and the psychiatrist to deal with a point of view as applied to his own science, his own professional skill. It is a preliminary indoctrination which is to permit the reader a new step forward, a step towards the clarifica tion of his own basic tools, his psychological and psychiatric theories, his language. Since this effort is directed towards one's very self it may well be easier to look at first at others, understand them more fully, and thus reduce one's own resistance before making a direct attack a one's personal domaine. The method of presentation we have in mind might not meet with everyone's approval. Most of us were brought up in a cultural atmosphere of "digests", and we expect from an author short, precise articels that are easy to follow, are digested for us, contain basic facts and conclusions, and do not require our time or real involvement. We are satisfied as long as we understand intellectually and we resent all attempts at involving us in a real thinking process. This paper will violate all these requirements, since the author is convinced that his point of view will only be appreciated if the reader shares with him the process towards clarifica tion rather than "conclusions". This process towards the goal is not only an intellectual but an emotional one as well, and the goal is not the psychology but towards letter psy chological viewpoints. Kant opened his lectures with the promise that he was not to teach his students philosophy but how to philosophize. He did not quite live up to his promise and developed his philosophical system. We shall try to be more faithful to our basic intention which is not directed towards a new psychology but towards better psy chological activity. The student of the psychological and psychiatric sciences is overwhelmed by an apparent confusion. There are dozens</page><page sequence="9">85 of schools, opposing each other, many different professional lingos or shall we say different theoretical concepts, claims and counter-claims, refutations, proofs, etc. This is true for both psychology and psychiatry. 10) The author limits his present efforts to the field of psychological application in therapy, particularly to psy choanalysis and its different "schools". Psychoanalytic and psychiatric effort is expanding today and is becoming an effective social force. That this is the case is not only a result of its own pro gress but points also towards the social need in our time. The second world war and the tremendous effort in' the selection of effective personnel has made us more aware of the psychological problems confronting us. The many in need look for help and take it where they can find it. It is up then to those who give the help, who develop the tools of psychotherapeutic help, to offer the best possible. Re search programs expand, and psychological workers have a greater incentive to examine their tools; and the main tool of psychiatric help is their professional, their own self. We help through words. Our theories and our concepts are made of words. The communications from our patients are mainly made up of words. And we all are aware that our main skill, understanding and interpretation at the proper moment of feeling, depends to a large degree on our ability to understand what the patient is trying to communicate, through language proper or through the symbolism of the language of dreams, of actions and of symptoms, whether the latter are psychological or somatic. It may prove worth while if, for a moment, we were to stop looking at the patient and his productions and turn our interests to ourselves. A perusal of our own theories, their language and the concepts we employ might prove most valuable. A look at our own philosophy may help us to understand better just what we can do with it, what its possibilities and its limitations are. It is as if we were for a moment to stop taking our theories for granted, and to examine them as if they too</page><page sequence="10">86 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. were symptoms. Incidentally, we do this quite frequently anyway when we look at the theories of the competing schools. The authors wish to call the reader's attention to the interesting phenomenon that all psychological and psy chiatric schools seem to find it useful to give a history of psychological thought and to show how the thought finally "developed" to their own particular point of view, the best and the latst one. Philosophers, incidentally, do quite fre quently the same, and their effort, as the effort of the psy chological indoctrinators, is directed at the debunking of the opposite schools. One seems to think that an "explana tion" of the other school, its interpretation through one's own particular psychology, will destroy its value and effec tiveness and will create faithful followers of the new trend of thought. It is interesting in this respect that the first effort is usually directed at an attempt to explain the psy chological motives, the character of a particular person that led to particular beliefs. It has been pointed out before, that an explanation of its author's motives does not destroy or weaken a theory even though such may be the intent of the explanation. 11, 12) We have mentioned a little while ago the psychological problems of ideologies, whether they are political in nature or of a broader function, such as a Weltanschauung. Here too the effort is made to "interpret" the ideology of the opposing' group in order to weaken its influence 13) It is fascinating that all these ideologies succeed, at least to the complete satisfaction of their followers in "fully interpreting" every other ideology, theory and what not, and that these followers fight the attempts of others to ' ' inter pret" their own irrefutable, absolutely correct and eternal belief. Psychologists and psychiatrists certainly must be aware of their own attempts to "explain" ideologies, literature, art products, etc., particularly since they are insistent upon the non-scientific character of these productions. Science itself, indeed psychological and psychiatric science also, is</page><page sequence="11">87 a product of our culture. And culture as suggested by Freud, Schilder and many others may be looked upon as the out come of psychic struggle. The suggestion is made, then, to look at psychological science and also psychiatric science as an ideology, as a Weltanschauung. Similar suggestions have been made but mainly in order to debunk it. Professor Blanchette, in his Philosophy of Psychoanalysis, seems to use the concepts of Thomas Aquinas to "refute" psycho analysis as a warped, mechanistic, materialistic, irrational Weltanschauung. Freud, on the other hand, insists that it is not, that it is a natural science. The point we shall at tempt to make is that every science can be considered an ideology. This attempt is not aimed at debunking or "ex plaining away", but hopes to gain thus new points of view, new insights, new research questions, and to free the creators of scientific theories from the bondage in which their theories place them. In the latter sense it is true that language may block scientific advance. The authors feel that psychothera peutic effort will be aided if the therapists look at their own tools even at the price of lowered self-esteem caused through the concession that their theories may not be the last and best but must be left open for revision, for continued change, and must possibly be given up if of no further use. Whenever the scientist has dared to look at his own creations, at his own tools of'Theory and concept, he has been ready for new advance. We are reminded of Einstein's now-famous investigation of the concept of " simultaneous ness" in physics that led to the theory of relativity although it meant that he had to give up comfortable ideas about the world of physics. Ideologies, like symptoms, serve a purpose. To under stand the purpose of one's own ideology from the point of view of psychology and sociology, to really know what the ideology means, does, and does not, is really an attempt at réévaluation, at understanding of one's own professional self. This effort, then, is not meant to be an addition to the "ideological warfare" in psychology and in psychiatry,</page><page sequence="12">88 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. is not another attempt at debunking another's or one's own theories and basic tenets, but one at integration. We are reminded of the old story of Tyll Eulenspiegel who tried to get out of the swamp by pulling his own hair. Scientists do not want to be guided in scientific research by religious dogma. They must learn to deal with the problems of scientific dogma. The purpose of this paper, then, is to study our main research tools, our means of communication, with which we construct our theories and concepts, our broad tenets, in order to clarify their function and to gain more complete insight of their and our usefulness and limitations. Our intent is not the creation of the language and the final theory in psychiatry but to find out what our own psychiatric "philosophy" and what the "philosophies" of conflicting "schools" really say. We who aim at the understanding of the communications we get from our patients are then to try to understand more fully our own communications. Psychological Elements in School Formation Mephistophales to the student : "Was diese Wissenschaft betrifft, Es ist so schwer, den falschen Weg zu meiden, Es liegt in ihr soviel verbogenes Gift, Und von der Arznei ist's kaum zu unterscheiden Am besten ist's auch hier, wenn Ihr nur einen hoert, Und auf des Meisters Worte schwoert. Im ganzen — haltet Euch an Worte! Dann geht Ihr durch die sichre Pforte Zum Tempel der Gewissheit ein Denn eben, wo Begriffe fehlen, Da stellt ein Wort zur rechten Zeit sich ein. Mit Worten laesst sich trefflich streiten, Mit Worten ein System bereiten, An Worte laesst sich trefflich glauben, Von einem Wort laesst sich kein Jota rauben" 14)</page><page sequence="13">89 While Germany's Goethe created his Faust out of the experience in and with his own culture one may readily see that Mephistopheles' suggestion seems to apply to all of our Western civilization, and perhaps to most cultural settings. The main tool of all learning, even in a gadget civilization — where many mechanical learning aids are available — is the human relationship between learner and teacher. All "schools", in religion or in philosophy, in science or other human activities, as can be seen in social and political move ments, have their leaders and the members of these groups develop allegiance not only to the thought, to the theory, but also to the founder of the "school". That is, we believe in the words of the masters because we believe in them. We do not believe that words can create the world but we believe in HIM, and thus we believe, if our religion follows the literal meaning of the Bible, that "God said, Let there be lights and there was light". Psychologically speaking, it seems as if there is not much difference between someone who believes in a scientific theory or someone who is a religious follower. They both invest interest and strong feelings perhaps, in the theory or the faith in which they believe. The faith attached to the theory, the philosophy or the religion was acquired through the relationship with the ones who taught us. There fore we find psychological similarity between the followers of a religious sect and those of a psychological "school". Uncomfortable as that thought may be one has only to think of the presidential address and its function, as it is peculiar to psychiatric conventions as well as to Rotary meetings. The scientific attitude, scientific scepticism, the willingness to modify one's theory according to observation and changing experience gives way to more simple forms of behavior, to group allegiance and the desire to be accepted, to be a part of the group at the expense of individual expression. The leader in his presidential address unites the group, and the tacit convention of not criticising, not discussing the presi dent's address would indicate that even psychiatrists or psy</page><page sequence="14">90 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. chologists follow a cultural pattern that is not too different from the setting of the erudite Faust. As a matter of fact, what we suggest calling ideological warfare in psychology and psychiatry receives its greatest strength from allegiance to the leaders of particular schools. It is fascinating to see for example how fashionable it has become not to be an "orthodox Freudian", as if belief in Freud was belief in a religious dogma. One rather wants to be a Neo-Freudian, a "modern". One wants to be different. It has been said that the European pattern relates well to Goethe's "Wen Ihr nur auf einen hoert, und auf des Meisters Worte schwoert". 15) In the authoritarian culture of Germany or Austria it was a part of one's adjustment to follow, to be alike, to be a Freudian, a Kantian, an Adlerian, and the like, it is said. But here, in the "land of the free and the home of the brave" people believe in difference. Is it perhaps for this reason that Rank's psychology of differ ence, as he proposed to call it, found quite a number of able followers ? We suspect, though, that the desire to be different is only the other side of the coin. It reminds one of the adolescent who — after having felt, fantasied through the "family romance," the Familien Roman to use a term Otto Rank has coined — now goes about trying to be different, to grow up and away from the family and the authorities of childhood. But the adolescent gives away his need for dependence, for emotional security, for love and acceptance, in looking up now to new leaders who help him to modify his ego-ideals and to find adequate self-expression in later adulthood. All the psychological groups which clamor for independence, for a new psychology, for difference, soon enough form their own "schools", find their own leaders. And if they were free enough to look at the psychological structure of their own creation they would find that not much has changed. They have now a "new" psychology, a new ideology; but the group and leader allegiance is the same as it was in the days of the Berggasse in Vienna. 16)</page><page sequence="15">91 Ideological Elements in Science We are afraid that the reader who has chosen to follow us till now will grow restless and annoyed because we have labeled his scientific and professional convictions with the term "ideology" without explaining what we "really mean. He may readily admit the significance of the personal rela tionship in learning and loyalty to his teacher, but he also may want to call our attention to the fact that science and religious faith, while both are acquired through tradition, through the medium of learning from a person, while both are imbued with the emotional attachment that goes with education, show important differences that are also reflected in the emotional attitudes of those who believe in them. This is true and no doubt we mean something very dif ferent when we employ the verb "to believe" in two sen tences, such as, "I believe in the Holy Trinity," or "I beliçve in the Laws of Kepler." The difference in the use of the word "to believe" will become more clear, we hope, when we will be permitted to take time out for a moment in order to clarify the concept of "ideology" as used in this paper. The author has tried to throw some light on certain psycho logical aspects of political ideologies. 17 ) He stated : "An ideology is for the most part a rather strange mixture of scientific and everyday statements (some of them true, some of them false), of philosophical gen eralizations and principles, of orders, moral principles, expressions of decisions and faith. Many people over look the fact that ideologies cannot be regarded as scientific theories (false or otherwise). The latter are of a different logical nature so to speak. It is possible to prove or to refute a scientific theory. This, however, is different in so far as ideologies are con cerned. ' ' He points out then that scientific theory requires "proof based on evidence", and that ideologies express not only what can be checked, refuted, or accepted as true, but also feelings, moods, likes, dislikes, preferences, and that the nucleus of</page><page sequence="16">92 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. the ideological "weave structure" consists of certain basic tenets which cannot be proved or refuted, but are ' ' believed ' ' like a religious creed, a dogma. A dogma, by definition, then, is the type of statement that cannot be checked. Dogmas give psychological security and we hold* on to them even at the expense of having to give up our ordinary habits of criticism, and checking. The dogmatic basic tenets of an ideology are invulnerable even to sound suspicion. He who believes in dogmas does not question them, does not suspect them to be outdated or in need of modification. We believe in dogmas through the teachings of our educators. Our trust in them, our affection for them, perhaps also quite frequently our repressed hos tility against them, makes it impossible for us to doubt their basic tenets. We are now believers, their followers, trusted and accepted members of the "school." The author wishes to extend this discussion of the nature of an ideology to science in general and to psychiastric and psychological theory in particular. There is something dog matic in science also, and certainly there will be many dog matic elements in the young social sciences. The author received a letter recently from a competent psychological practicitioner in response to a paper he had sent him. This friend of good old days writes: " Unfortunately I am not any longer a friend of the Lïbidotheory. I don't think it is tenable and think that it delays the progress of insight and of practical work wherever one tries to hold on to it. I hope I don't shock you with so impudent an asser tion." The informal and friendly nature of the letter, which permitted the writer to be perhaps a bit more careless, or may we say more free with his statement is a good indica tion of the feelings we have when we try to approach the scientific beliefs which we hold as basic tenets with a critical mind. Even scientific theories are dogmatic in their basis, and as attempted change poses not only a logical or scientific problem for the one who attempts the change but an emo tional problem as well. Change involves not only a problem</page><page sequence="17">93 in regard to one's attitude to the elders who taught us but also in regard to the group who may want to hold on to the point in question, and may reject us as a heretic. Isn't it true that the group, may it be a matter of political faith or one of psychiatric conviction, turns its aggression against the deserter, the former member, rather than against those who never shared the point of view of the group and who may be the really dangerous ones? The deserter is fought off violently because he arouses temptations of desertion in the rest of us. The interesting thing is that the one who invents cer tain basic theories which may be dogmatic at their very base may be quite aware of the dogmatic character of such theories and still believe in them. We think of Freud's re peated comment that he considered his Theory of the In stincts 18) the Mythology, "Our Mythology" of Psycho analysis. Science rests as we know not only on observation but also on a rationale. Conceptualization, generalization and the use of general hypotheses, the effort to establish scientific laws, that is, valid descriptions, all are attempts not based merely on observation but also make use of the orizing that carries into our observation something unre liable, debatable, refutable, or whatever we may care to call the factors that are beyond observation and direct proof. This is not done in order to serve the philosophical doctrine of rationalism but because of certain advantages, certain functions we expect science to fulfill. Additional viewpoints can be gained if we view the ideological aspects of theory formation as products of dy namic psychological processes, as if they were neurotic symp toms, or a problem of character formation, etc. The fact that one can 'understand' certain aspects of the thory formation does not necessarily say anything about its value as a heuristic scientific hypothesis : like a symptom, a hypothesis is a compromise formation. It is in part a function of the Ego's attempt for reality adaption and reali</page><page sequence="18">94 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. ty testing, and in part an attempt at gratification, designed to give an answer to a personal problem. On the other hand, the particular form the formulation may take can be viewed as a direct function of the particular culture or subculture in which the scientist lives: dialectic materialism then may become the frame of reference for exploration. For instance the need for quantification and the whole orientation to exact measurement and statistical formulation can be seen in relation to our increasingly tech nical capitalistic society. In brief it can be shown that any hypothesis can be described according to the formulation of Bellak: 19) where by every human production has three qualities : adaptivity, expressiveness, and projectivity. The hypothesis is designed to help in the adaptation to reality necessary for survival. The particular form the hypothesis takes — the expression of the hypothesis — is a function of certain formal character istics of the individual and of his environment. Finally, the perception of the reality problem — (and the hypothesis is designed to grapple with it) — is influenced or shaped by the intrapersonal needs and tensions of the scientist, like any other perceptual problem. These latter two aspects form what one might consider the "ideological aspects" of a hy pothesis. Principally speaking one might say then that the "good ness" of a hypothesis is a direct function of the 'quantity' of adaptation in it and it is as bad as the amount of expres sive and projective aspects in it. Thus, the progress of science consists of successive hypothesis which in part con stitute a better reality adaptation and in part consist of expressive and projective aspects of the various scientists. Dogma and Cultural Function It has been stated that science has three functions : un derstanding, prediction, and control. It seems to the writer that this is only conditionally true in our industrial age.</page><page sequence="19">95 Scientific efforts in epochs gone by were more modest 20) or perhaps it will be better to say had different functions, and therefore quite frequently different basic tenets. Scien tists in the Middle Ages were more concerned with the glori fication of God, and the power of the Church than they were with matters of production, of control. And even today we find scientists who are satisfied with more modest activi ties. It will be helpful to recall the delightful book by Hugh Gray and Lillian R. Lieber, The Education of T. C. Mits. It reminds the reader of different and separate scientific activities, expressed perhaps through different attitudes of the scientists, and for different purposes. There is produc tion, invention, pure science, and the application of the classi cal mathematics of the past to the findings of the "pure" scientists by the mathematicians. The pure scientists have no direct interest in application and seem to be driven by curiosity. In days gone by almost all scientific activity prided itself in being pure and academic and the thought of appli cation was almost immoral. (Even today there are learning institutions with this kind of ivory tower philosophy). This division of labor, reflecting different attitudes and different purposes, does create differences in "schools," in basic as sumptions, and leads to different ideologies, different dogmas. Who is to convince a pure scientist for example that he should give up his dogma of "purity", that he should work towards application. His education, his whole make-up would be against it and were he to undergo an analysis one would see, of course, that his dogmatic beliefs in pure science are but a reflection of his emotional tie up with significant educators in his past. While the pure scientist will be interested in under standing, whatever that may be, he might find it unimpor tant to contribute towards prediction and control. It should also be added that control refers to different matters in different situations as we shall see. To apply all this to psychology it will be clear that the kind of control Thomas Aquinas might have had in mind if he had thought in our</page><page sequence="20">96 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. terms would be totally different from the kind modern psy chiatry uses. Of course, he did not believe in ' ' blind mechan ical forces of causality" but he developed a kind of psy chological philosophy that was to produce an ideology which would strengthen the Church, would turn the unbelievers into faithful ones. The psychologist of the industrial age who strives for increased production and efficiency, who wants to select per sonnel, whether it be for the army or the factory, will hardly develop the concept of the unconscious, and we begin to understand that the type of theory developed has to do with the purpose in mind. The goal of one's activity is respon sible, (i.e. we are responsible because the goals are our goals,) for the kind of interest we develop, for the kind of theory Ave shall employ, and for the kind of dogma in which we believe. One might say at this point then that originally the "dogma in science" refers to the goal we have in mind, the function we have chosen for our activity. But, as time goes on, as we develop "schools" and as we get followers, we start to forget the original limited function and our out look develops now into a rigid mental set that ranges into other fields as well, and suddenly we develop not one psy chologal activity but the psychology. We have oversimplified this concept, but perhaps we have given sufficient indication of the process in question so that it will be possible for the truly interested person to ask the kind of sociological and psychological questions that will give the answers to the problems suggested. While forming this over-all psychology we may even give lip service to the usefulness of other schools, and we may be able to tame our hostility and to restrict expressions of our feeling that the thing we do is the only important one, the true science. Psy chiatrists and psychologists in our culture certainly do this to some extent, obviously because a part of their general behavior and attitude pattern is "democratic", which re stricts hostility and the desire to dominate to a large degree, and channels these attitudes into permissible modes of ex</page><page sequence="21">97 pression. On the other hand, anyone who is at all sensitive to the social pressure that is expressed in schools and insti tutions of research will have experienced the opposite trend as well that tries to mold him into the pattern of the in stitution, that is the particular "philosophy", "point of view", "stressing of certain factors", implied dogmas we may call them, and tries to make him into a faithful follower of the psychiatric creed of that institution. This is expressed in requirements for the job, in subtle but effective efforts at training and supervision, in the encouragement that is given to certain trends and the discouragement that is given to others. It is expressed in the usual belief so necessary for any group that their group and their work express the best and the newest (work morale we may want to call this generously), and that experiences elsewhere while of some value really do not count. There are, one may assume, very few institutions where this type of school-thinking finds little expression and where a great deal of security on the part of the leader and the group permits the greatest amount of individual self-expression and leeway in the realm of ideologi cal formulations. To some extent it is even true to say that too much self-expression endangers the group, endangers group research and effective work. Some while ago we spoke about the research psycholo gist and it was suggested that a part of his ideological "weave structure," a part of his dogmatic basic tenets, are brought about through the function of his work, which is tied up so clearly with our industrial culture. The kind of "proofs" he needs in order to satisfy the demands of his ideology are reflected in his faith in the laboratory setting, the controlled experiment, the sharply defined concepts, the strong suspicion he has against anything that cannot be expressed in exact terms, in statistical data and in clear formulae. Any activity that does not follow the almost ritual istic pattern of his research mind (as satyrized by the trial runs of the rat in maze learning) is not "truly scientific". These psychologists of course do not live in a social vacuum</page><page sequence="22">98 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. and therefore are confronted with other psychological ac tivities which bombard their minds continuously. Their reactions to the "danger" they are confronted with are an expression we presume of the particular characters they have developed. In this respect they are not different from other people who have their own defense mechanisms against the new that arouses feelings of anxiety. The reaction of the world to the new science of psychoanalysis, the history of the psychoanalytic movement, are a good example of it and we assume that psychologists are not and were not different in their reactions from the medical profession and the lay world. English-speaking countries perhaps more than others have made an attempt at integration, since they could afford it, and it is interesting to see just what happened to the psychologists before they were able to occupy them selves seriously with the new science. A good sample of the ideological problem involved is the very positive and well-meant study of Robert R. Sears, Survey of Objective Studies of Psychoanalytic Concepts. It is a fascinating book because it shows that many efforts that have been made at integration. It is as if the psychologists had discovered that their own psychological ideology, their conception of what constitutes "a true science" needed expansion and clarification. They were ready to accept and to incorporate the new findings, the new observations and theories if and when it would be possible to "prove" them according to the standards of their own psychological ideology. Sears states: "The experiments and observations examined in this report stand testimony that few investigators feel free to accept Freud's statements at face value. The rea son lies in the same factor that makes psychoanalysis a bad science its method. Psychoanalysis relies upon techniques that do not admit of the repetition of the observation, that have no self-evident or denotative validity, and that are tinctured to an unknown degree with the observers own suggestions. These difficulties may not seriously interfere with therapy, but when the</page><page sequence="23">99 method is used for uncovering psychological facts that are required to have objective validity it simply fails." This is a good criticism if we were to agree that a "true science" is defined as outlined above. We have suggested though that there are many scientific activities and that they have to be examined in terms of their own function, rather than in terms of the function of another science and through another ideology, that is a system of thoughts not free of dogma. Psychologists seem to feel this too. The author is reminded of a few psychological colleagues who teach academ ic psychology with the ideology of laboratory proof feeling that analysis is almost not worth mentioning but as far as their own therapeutic needs are concerned they speak faith fully of "my analyst" and we doubt that they ask their analysts for statistical evidence, for controlled and repeated experiments when they make use of the therapeutic expe rience. Another example that illustrates the difficulties of scientific integration can be found in the emotional attitudes that exist between the academic physiologist, or pharma cologist or pathologist and the medical clinician. They re semble very much the ones between psychologist and psycho analyst. The pathologist, etc., feels that the clinician fol lows 'intuitions' and empirical beliefs which cannot be ob jectively demonstrated and scoffs at him, while the clinician often feels that the physiologist, the pharmacologist or path ologist is some kind of underprivileged being she stubbornly refuses to see facts or maintains rigid standards which are only of textbook use. The differences described are due to the inherent characteristics of the different functions in different scientific activities. The clinician has to do with a type of problem which requires a certain type of response on his part for which he develops a certain frame of refer ence, a certain ideology, however "imperfect" for the time being, or from the point of view of the research man. His need and his opportunities for objective verification are limited.</page><page sequence="24">100 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. On the other hand the academic worker deals with prob lems of his own choosing, under the dictates of his own critique and those of exact laboratory conditions. This is meant merely to show what a difficult problem "integration" really is because it requires a focus on the function of one's activity. Already this has made the reader aware of the point we wish to make in regard to psychologies the primary function of which is therapy, curing, changing. The "proofs", the scientific instruments of observation, of checking, the search for confirmation, will find their defini tion through the purpose rather than through certain "ob jective values". If one were to decide if anything is "a true science ' ' one must find out first if it fulfills its function. It may well be that it is a true science as far as the particular function is concerned but that it would be a bad one were we to expect that it serve other purposes as well. Functions of Psychoanalysis It is said that psychoanalysis is more than a therapeutic technique. Ernst Kris and Heinz Hartman in a very cre ative and fruitful paper on, The Genetic Approach in Psy choanalysis, discuss also the three functions of psychoanaly sis or, to put it into their own words, the fact that the word psychoanalysis is commonly used to designate three things: a therapeutic technique, which we here call "psychoanalytic therapy", an observational method to which we here refer as the "psychoanalytic interview", and a body of hypotheses for which we here reserve the term "psychoanalysis". It is important to keep this in mind if we are to understand the problems we are out to clarify in the ideological warfare in psychology and psychiatry. Psychoanalysis started out as a method of treatment, a form of psychotherapy, and its original function was an attempt at curing, at the removal of the symptom which led to the belief that its causes, inner conflicts, had to be removed through the treatment pro cedure. In order to treat we have to look not only for</page><page sequence="25">101 working psychotherapeutic procedures, but we have to try to understand the nature of the illness: i.e., attempt to understand the underlying personality structure that made for illness. The desire to help leads to the desire to under stand, to explore. The desire for control leads to the desire for understanding and prediction. The former is hardly possible without the latter. We don't know if this is his torically correct as applied to the founder of psychoanalysis in whose days education, even in the medical sciences, and certainly in psychiatry, was oriented toward research, to ward objective finding, more than toward application. We have but to recall the descriptive psychiatry of Kraepolin in order to appreciate the significance of this trend. What ever the main impulses of Freud may have been, and the emphasis of his interests certainly shifted during his long and productive life, it is certainly correct to note that he and his pupils have made not only psychotherapeutic at tempts but others as well, and as Kris and Hartman point out so well the word psychoanalysis has come to designate a good many scientific endeavors which we know are related to each other; but differences in terms of purpose, research methods, and underlying ideology we fail to recognize. Kris and Hartmann 's discussion of the difference between "dy namic" and "genetic" propositions in psychoanalysis cer tainly points the way to certain important differences as we shall see later. Differences of opinion as to whether or not psycho analysis is a "good science" could be ironed out if the par ticipants in such a discussion would try being aware of their own ideology, their dogmatic basic tenets, as to what the function of science is. They would have to judge psycho analysis not in to but in terms of its particular function, its particular purpose, within a given problem that is to be solved. Psychoanalysis has opened so many new paths in many branches of science and of other human activities that it is certainly impossible for the handful of trained experts^ usually therapists at heart, to be fully aware of</page><page sequence="26">102 Rudolf Elcstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. the goal of each of these paths and to then apply correctly whatever the new science — therapy, method of observation and theory — has to offer. This is true for other sciences as well and the history of scientific thought does not indi cate that it was easier in the past or in other branches of science to reach the kind of clarity and understanding of the function of science in a particular application. It is not only the "academic" psychologists and the ones who do "ideal research" who find it difficult to modify their ideological thinking, their mental set, but the psy chiatrists and analysts also suffer from their own ideology. When they make efforts at integration, they too seem either to act out of their own mental set, their own "dogma" as to what is a "good psychology" or they try to "live up" to the demands of exact, "real" science and make efforts to "prove" that their findings are just as "exact", "re liable" as the others; that their analytic couch too is con trolled experiment, etc. Carl Rogers and some of his stu dents seem to even find it necessary to bring statistical evi dence for the value of their "non-directive" therapy. It is not intended to claim that such efforts are useless but rather that they ought to be preceded by a careful analysis of one's objectives, one's function, and the necessary con clusions as to what activities, observational methods, "in struments", etc., -are tied up with the function and thus define the type of science with which one deals. It is ob viously necessary to get away from a value point of view. A particular scientific activity is not to be valued from the point of view of "ideal" scientific procedures but from the point of view of its own function, its own range of activities and the "instruments" involved. We would then give up the division of psychological systems into "good" and "bad", and we would learn to be more fully aware of their function, their way of operating. A functional and operating defin ition would take the place of an undynamic comparison with "ideal" conditions. This way of examining scientific activity and scientific propositions is not intended to keep</page><page sequence="27">103 out efforts at improving, at integration, at constant move ment towards sharpened scientific "instruments", tools of prediction and control (which in psychology and in psychia try include the tool of the professional self) but tries to avoid the loss of the focus of one's activity, the function of the particular science. To follow once more the suggestions of Kris and Hart man one may well see that the three kinds of propositions that can be found in psychoanalysis really do point up three functions, three activities. Therapeutic propositions such as certain rules of "interpretation" stem from the objective of cure. They are really instructions for control. Dynamic propositions tell us about the make-up of man. In a way they are. no more than descriptions. However, they are tied up with the therapeutic proposition inasmuch as cer tain descriptions, certain dynamic propositions, make us aware of the kind of therapeutic propositions usable in a particular situation. This holds true for genetic propo sitions as well. They explain the origin of a symptom and quite frequently psychoanalytic authors do not know if a proposition is of a genetic or a therapeutic nature: that is, if it simply explains, or if its function is to cure. It is at this point that the authors would like to suggest the use of the term interpretatisn whenever the statement in question is meant therapeutically, aiming at change, and to use the term explanation whenever genetic or dynamic propositions are used without therapeutic intent. To give an example: Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex, by Freud con tains mainly genetic and dynamic propositions, no thera peutic ones. If however, some of the information in regard to the pregenital stages is given to patients at a proper moment, as suggested for example in Technique of Psycho analytic Therapy by Sandor Lorand, they will then become therapeutic propositions aimed at cure. Interpretation, then consists of therapeutic propositions, even though the "same" propositions may be of a genetic or dynamic nature in another context. A good many of the</page><page sequence="28">104 Rudolf Eksfein, M.S.S., Ph.D. pros and cons in the present "ideological struggle" between the different schools reflect, it seems to us, the unawareness of the participants of the true nature of these statements as will be demonstrated later. Freud's psychoanalysis then, is aimed at research and at therapy. Otto Rank, for example, objected to this, feel ing that the aims of research and therapy are conflicting ones, and his disciples in psychotherapy and functional case work would be inclined to feel that research interests and therapeutic interests should be kept apart. The true thera pist would do nothing but psychotherapy while the research man would give up any effort at therapy and restrict his activities to mere research. Otto Rank who claimed during the latter part of his professional career that he wanted to be a therapist rather than a research psychologist did cer tainly make creative research contributions to psychology, and he would hardly object to the statement that the develop ment of therapy depends on continued research, and that research cannot work if the psychotherapist, who is as im portant in the therapeutic process as the patient, is left out. The idea that Freud's research was often done at the ex pense of the patient and lengthened the treatment process is not without hostile intent, even though it is added apolo getically that Freud was obliged to experiment because of the pioneering nature of therapy. Whenever we do not know how to help but grope in the dark and use trial and error methods we experiment — but not at the expense of the patient. The focus of the experiment is to find a new way of helping, not to collect abstract datas. The new way of helping, for example Freud's "experiment" to use free association instead of hypnosis happens not only to help but also yields scientific results in terms of many genetic and dynamic propositions. The experiment which intro duces new therapeutic propositions, new therapeutic rules, permits observation that lends itself to dynamic and genetic explanation. It is true, though, that these genetic and dynamic propo</page><page sequence="29">105 sitions in turn induce us to formulate new therapeutic ones. Statements about the Defense Mechanisms of the Ego would lead to ego analysis, that is, to therapeutic suggestions which would enrich therapeutic techniques. And in this sense it is also true that the differentiation into various statements as was proposed cannot always be done because the ac tivities behind them are not clearly separated. We try to help but we also try to understand, to find. We try to understand the patient, our own reactions in the treatment process, and at the same time-we are to react according to the needs of the patient. This very complicated use of oneself in therapy is reflected in the complex structure of psychoanalysis. Our effort to understand certain psychi atric or psychological principles then, is effort towards a freer use of oneself. We need to be clear as to what we are doing, and some of the clarity we want we shall acquire in looking at our formulated (and unformulated) beliefs. Sometimes it is easier to understand one's position if one tries to understand the position of others rather than simply to reject the opponent's theory. This forces one to pay more attention to one's own basic tenets. The Ideological Struggle Our paper would be very incomplete if we did net mention that the differences between a number of analytic schools are not merely caused by scientific disagreements. As a matter of fact it is well known that the first reaction that is always forthcoming in response to a new school is an attempt to explain the very personal motives for the action. We may recall Freud quoting Adler as saying that he did not want to stay in Freud's shadow all his life. About Rank it has been said that he was disappointed because Freud did not fully accept the theory of the Trauma of Birth. Breuer 's withdrawal has been explained in terms of his sexual inhibitions, Jung's change of heart and mind with his own background and personality, etc. And number</page><page sequence="30">106 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. less efforts have been made to explain Freud's theories in the light of his personality, the cultural milieu in which he grew up and lived. Others have been described in terms of their desire to dominate, their unwillingness to follow democratic procedure. All these points may be correct but they do not solve the basic problem of gen uine understanding of the principles involved rather than their genesis in terms of the author's personal history. It has also been pointed out that the differences are exag gerated because of group rivalries and other personal fac tors, and that the group rivalry itself leads to a new kind of leader cult. It is certainly true that every new group chooses new symbols and turns against the old. The new leader, — and psychiatrists are not different from social leaders, — expresses his difference not only in the additions he makes, but also he usually moves away from the old more and more. It is as if we could learn the new only through the rejection of the old. The adolescent who grows up rejects all father symbols, and the new psychiatric leader finds slowly or suddenly that all had been more or less wrong, and finds satisfaction in claiming that his is not psychoanalysis any longer but individual psychology, or will psychology. And others claim that they are not ortho dox but modern, not mechanistic but dynamic and express whatever slogan they may wish to use. And we see that soon they choose their own vocabulary, their own concepts, and refute the old as if what they believed yesterday had been altogether wrong and even dangerous. While the expert may feel that we exaggerate he is probably aware that the educated lay public at times sees nothing but dif ference and is confused when trying to find its way through the maze of psychiatric ideology. It is admitted that these personal factors, the group formations, the need to attract students, the different vested interests, the need for domination, and so on, that all these social-psychological factors, questions of economic and social control, of power, do affect the formation of psychiatric</page><page sequence="31">107 schools. But this is not too different from other social pheno mena in an individualistic, capitalistic industrial society. It is healthy and sometimes rough competition. However we are not concerned with these factors. While it may-be in triguing for the social psychologist or for the sociologist to search for the personality factors that make certain in dividuals found and lead schools and others into followers who join them, and to search for the socio-economic causes of such phenomenas, we are not interested in genetic and dynamic propositions of school formation. "We are con cerned here with these aspects of the new theories or changed theories that aim at scientific clarification, at therapeutic change, at the improvement of the professional self. Our focus then is neither socio-economic nor directed at the per sonality of the school founders and their followers but is directed at the evaluation of their truly scientific intentions. We are, to use an example, not interested in what personality factors led Karen Horney or H. S. Sullivan to the forma tion of their schools, and what kind of people "follow" them but what they are telling us. What is usable for the ad vancement of psychiatric and psychological science in the light of its function? Communications of people can be looked at with different focus. We may listen to them in order to find out about their reality situation, or their inner conflicts, or the type of society in which they live, or in order to solve our own problems, and so on. We listen ac cording to the focus we have. Here we are to look at the communications of our colleagues not just to understand them as persons, or to debunk them, but in order to interpret their communications from the point of view of our job, the development of a better psychotherapeutic science. They may have dogmas, as we do, but what do their dogmas mean in terms of their professional function? Such knowledge also helps us to understand our own dogmas in terms of our own function. While the benevolent part of the reader may be open to suggestion, to new insights and to a change of his present</page><page sequence="32">108 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. beliefs a good many of the reader's critical faculties will oppose the somewhat strange and obscure idea that certain scientific principles in psychology should be dogmatic in nature and not different from religious dogma. The scien tific mind which has striven for such long a time to elim inate religious dogma finds it hard to have anyone tell him now that he too is not free of the "sin of dogma". The strangeness of this may lead to its unacceptability and one may be determined to reject a new outlook even before one lias tried to fully familiarize oneself with it. It is for this reason that we ask the reader's indulgence, hoping that he may bear with us and accept an idea for the time being until he is fully familiar with its use and scope. He will realize later that we have not tried to wipe out difference between religion, science, and philosophy. It may be hinted at this point that the kind of propositions in science that we call dogmatic are of a different nature than the dogmas of religion. But since it is more the similarity of their psy chological character than the difference in logical structure that seems to yield certain useful results, we will take up the logical differences at a later point. Determinism Let us turn now to some of the generalizations that are used to express differences in psychiatric opinion. The first example to be analyzed is one that affects any scientific dis cussion, particularly where psychological considerations are involved. It is the problem of causality or of determinism. Jt is a problem charged with emotion for everyone who has l ad the customary academic training, and the mere mention of it awakens a good many associations from past experience. And while one may assume that it is a purely philosophical issue one cannot help but discover that psychological and particularly psychiatric books are colored by the particular views their authors hold on causality or determinism. What ever the significance of that may be it is interesting to refer</page><page sequence="33">109 to the fact that modern authors on physics seem to be free of the need to discuss the concepts of causality or determin ism. Einstein and Infeld in their book on, The Evolution of Physics, seem to get along without the discussion of the problem of causality. It is as if they were to tell us that the problem does not exist for them, that physics has grown out of its childhood illnesses and is a true science today. This certainly is not true for psychiatry and psychology, and the different positions of scientists in regard to the prob lem of determinism are symbolic of the differences in the field. Robert P. Knight in an article, Determinism, "Free dom," and Psychotherapy, tries to combine the principle of determinism with the therapeutic aim of freedom of choice. While we agree with his basic tenet that all science, certainly also psychology, is deterministic we should like to throw some additional light on the true significance of tHe statement, "Determinism is a fundamental tenet of all science". (Quote from Knight's address) One of the authors, Rudolf Ekstein, in Human Freedom and Psycho logical Science, has analyzed some of the psychological and logical difficulties that have led to the misconception of the nature of causality and determinism. He explains there that psychological laws like all other laws are not orders but descriptions. These descriptions are never complete and therefore very frequently have to be enlarged in order to permit better descriptions of a more general nature. The misconception of the nature of a scientific law is caused through a logical misunderstanding and through our atti tude. The anthropomorphic use of language in science has caused the logical misunderstanding. Our psychological need for a creator and protector, a powerful being enforcing a certain security, giving an order of things, has caused our inability to see the logical error. Psychological laws make us neither free nor slave, but they help us to understand why we feel free or slave. If the world were indescribable, i.e., if we had ne scientific laws, we could not find the con</page><page sequence="34">110 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. ditions necessary for the experience of freedom. Psycho logical laws do not compel us but they give us some of the tools necessary for the achievement of emotional health. The last statement needs some elaboration which will permit the authors to develop Ekstein's point one step fur ther. Karl A. Menninger in discussing this concept of causality in response to Bellak and Ekstein's paper on, The Extension of Basic Scientific Laws to Psychoanalysis and Psychology, expresses certain questions he has about the problem of causality as follows: "I was under the impres sion that the principle of causality had been abandoned, at least in the sense of event x causing event y. I have long put stress on the fact that to speak of something causing something else was fallacy, that all we could say is that event y follows event x and bears some relation to it in a time space continuum. ' ' "I think one cannot say that a mother slaps her child because she is angry. I doubt if it is logically correct that a tire deflates because it has been punctured. If one is going to speak of causes at all, one must say that it deflates because air pressure, gravity, the elasticity of rubber and other things being as they are a puncture brings about a change of conditions such that deflation follows. What you call the principle of causality I thought had long since been decided should be called a law of continuity or something of the kind". Dr. Menninger's comments then call atten tion to the fact that we are free to call anything we care to The Cause, that there is not one cause but many and while he would agree with us that the principle of causality is not more than our determination to use scientific language, our decision to look for causes whenever we are puzzled about something, he shows adequately through his example that it is obviously an arbitrary decision just which sequence of events we care to call cause and event. This is true as long as we remain in a field of pure science. In pure science one is logically correct in making anything one wants to the cause of an event, as long as one remains in a certain time</page><page sequence="35">111 space continuum. But if we think of psychology as a science that is not only to understand, to trace abstract connections, but to predict and control, we will not be able to make con structive use of a view such as expressed in Dr. Menninger's communication. And he indeed more than the research psychologist is aware of it as indicated in his work as a psychiatrist, as someone who seeks methods of control of mental and emotional illness. While in an abstract way it is possible to call many different events the cause of one particular event this proves meaningless in scientific applica tion. In any applied science we shall try to find these key events that help us to control a certain event. Therefore it would be correct to say that the turning of the light switch causes the event "light in the bulb". If the bulb should not work in spite of the turning of the light switch we would then try to find the key event that "caused" this, the shutting off of the main power or the burning through of the fuse, etc. In a way then, one needs a more or'less complete understanding of electrical theory, that is all the descriptions that are likely to help us in determining the key event the control of which leads to the control of the event (the cause of which we are seeking). This is not too different in psychology. It is correct to say that psychology like any other science is determin istic, i.e., follows the law of causality. That means that we use scientific language, scientific descriptions, that we are determined always to look for causes even when we are seriously baffled. We might want to say as Dr. Menninger suggests that in psychology there is "only" a law of con tinuity. That means no more or less than our decision not to select a key event as cause but to enlarge our descriptions, to generalize, so to speak. It is a decision to remain in the field of pure science. This however is neither our nor Dr. Menninger's decision. In applied science such as in psy chotherapy we search for The Cause, for the key event that helps us to control the illness. Incidentally, the differentiation between "applied" and</page><page sequence="36">112 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. "pure" science is also an arbitrary one and is misleading in a number of ways. First of all it suggests a system of values as if to say that one does a dirty job if one does not deal with pure science. Social science then would not be pure because the psychologist would step down from the ivory tower of academic science and might make his hands dirty in dealing with subject matter that should better remain in the hands of the politician. It also gives the ap pearance that application makes science less scientific. That may be true quite often. In psychotherapy we think it may be just the other way round. "Pure" psychology looks at a homo psychologies but applied psychology such as thera py has taught us to look at psychological relationships, to look at man as he relates to fellow man, to look at the psy chotherapeutic relationship, to see dynamic Gestalten, to avoid isolation where isolation hinders the formation of use ful insight and to look for real key events, that is for the kind of causes that are important in prediction and control. This discussion of "causality" and "determinism" should aid us now when looking at some of the positions psy chologists and psychiatrists take in regard to it. It will permit us to avoid involvement in an outworn philosophical argument but to look at their philosophical positions with different eyes. Rather than try to prove that they are right or wrong, that their philosophical position is correct or ought to be refuted we shall try to understand what kind of decision they have made and expressed quasi-symbolically through their philosophical thesis. One way one might go about it was indicated in a paper by Bkstein on The Philo sophical Refutation, which deals with the character of philosophical theses as far as their logical structure is con cerned. Here, however, we are concerned with the logical and even more the psychological implications of certain theses that are applied in psychological science. Ov er-Determinism Let us turn our attention first to an important thesis</page><page sequence="37">113 in psychoanalytic thinking which Freud characterized through the concept of overdeterminism. At first glance one may be tempted to assume that this means that certain psychic phenomena have more than one cause, are deter mined not through one event but are overdetermined through more than one. According to Masserman in Principles of Dynamic Psychiatry, overdetermination could be character ized through "a process whereby a single behavior pattern becomes adaptive to many unconscious needs, thus rendering it particularly fixed and resistant to therapy. For instance, an hysterical paralysis of an arm may be a combat flyers initial reaction to a crash landing, but later the same symp tom may also come to symbolize (a) an unconscious defense against his own mobilized aggression, (b) a rationalized excuse for not returning to a hated civilian job, (c) expia tion for a regressive dependence on a government pension, etc." The statement that certain phenomena in psychology are overdetermined may seem to mean that there is a real cleavage between physical and psychological science. In physics determinism rules while overdetermination is the basic principle in psychology. The naive thinker would then believe that events in psychology are determined through many causes while events as described by physics have just one single cause. The clarification of this misconception is not too difficult. First of all it is possible to ascribe to any psychological or physical event as many "causes" as one cares to as Dr. Menninger has pointed out in the communication mentioned. On the other hand, if one thinks in terms of control one will find then that the term overdetermination does not refer to a difference in the structure of the fundamentals of the- two branches of science but refers to certain control propositions. The control proposition: "Change the fuse and the electric light will work again" permits us to say that there is just one cause for the blackout and that is the burned out fuse. Follow the proposition and you will get results. This however is quite different in the case of the paralyzed</page><page sequence="38">114 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. pilot. It is true that a "more complete" understanding of the working of the electric light needs a great deal of theory of electricity, that is a general description with many, many causes for the working of the bulb. One could even intro duce a new principle into physics and declare that physics cannot be understood without the principle of overdeter mination. The working of the light is "caused" by a good fuse, certain wire combinations, the working of the power plants, the heavy rain fall in the mountain where the stream is supplied that supplies the plant, certain weather con ditions that relate to the gulf stream which is caused through certain geological effects, and so forth. Indeed, there is overdetermination as long as we remain in the field of "pure" unapplied science. But we haven't met the electrician yet who needs to know about astronomy in order to change a fuse. The example we think suggests that the concept of overdetermination in psychoanalysis has no philosophical implications but really does characterize the kind of propo sitions which we have called therapeutic propositions or which one may prefer to call "control propositions". (We prefer the former term in order to avoid certain misunder standings that may be created because of a certain use of the term Kontrollsatz in logical positivism). At an earlier point in our presentation we followed a suggestion of Hart mann and Kris and suggested that psychoanalytic propo sitions may be better understood if we differentiate between dynamic and genetic propositions. We added then, keeping in mind the therapeutic function of psychoanalysis, the con cept of a therapeutic proposition. The principle of over determination does characterize these therapeutic proposi tions. To take up again the example of Masserman it should be clear then that the paralysis can only be cured if we look for the "broken fuse" but interestingly enough hysteri cal symptoms of that kind are overdetermined which simply means that the therapist will have to look not only for one broken fuse but for a number of other determinations. Or,</page><page sequence="39">115 to make it clearer when he starts to work with the patient he will be able to help adequately only after he has "worked through" a number of these "causes". Overdetermination then simply is a kind of psychotherapeutic direction and reminds the therapist that he can hardly expect genuine cure if, let us say, he works only on the problem of fear of return to service. That symptoms are resistant and fixated simply means that the therapist cannot expect cure after one interpretation. In other words, the symptom as far as its cure is concerned is dependent on a number of determina tions. Interestingly enough, it is always true as in the physical sciences that the psychologist could find many more causes within the person and outside the person that explain the symptom than he needs to cure it. Analysis could go father and farther and research studies certainly could go back to the superego of the grandmother of the pilot and so forth. One may say if one cares to that the symptom really is determined through an unlimited series of causes. The principle of overdetermination is simply a generalization of therapy, an indication of the kind of therapeutic propo sitions, of treatment directions we may expect in neurosis and psychosis. Whenever we hear the term overdetermination we really have to look for therapeutic propositions, state ments that refer to the science of influencing, changing, cur ing, rather than to ideal and abstract explanations of "pure" science. In this respect we must admit that the moralists are right in assuming that psychoanalysis is not a "pure" science, nor did it ever intend to be one. Indeterminism The belief in determinism then, is nothing else than a belief in certain types of control. One of Robert P. Knight's examples in the paper mentioned deals with the feeling of the courts in relation to psychoanalysis as a new threat of psychological determinism. Not that psychoanalysis, as R. P. Knight correctly points out, is any different in that re</page><page sequence="40">116 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. spect from other sciences, but certainly its insights into the psychological nature of crime and its techniques of control are quite frequently opposed to the practices of the courts. The courts then react not so much to a philosophical principle as to a method of control, to the therapeutic propositions for which it stands. It is easier, it seems, to defend one's position through philosophical slogans than it would be to do so were one to present the undisguised problem. The authors also wish to call attention to a num ber of examples in Knight's paper that deal with the problem of determinism in psychology as it has been used throughout the ages for the defense of certain methods of social control, mainly in the organizations of the medieval church. In Karen Horney's New Ways of Psychoanalysis one finds, of course, also some comments on Determinism, and it has been pointed out by critics that Karen Horney has given up scientific genetic psychology and that she stands for a kind of indeterminism, or at least a partial indetermin ism, in as much as she would admit a determinism of cultural forces only. Were one to take her comments on determinism or causality seriously one couldn't help but smile at the naivete of her logic, if we were to assume that her "mainly cultural determinism" refers to generic psychological science. No cause is more important than any other, that is, general descriptions in science do not know a stronger and a weaker cause, and there is no break between the different determinants. Her comments do not refer to dy namic or genetic statements as long as we remain within psychoanalytic theory per se. Her feeling that biological factors are less important than cultural factors simply re fers to psychoanalytic therapy, to therapeutic propositions. It means that in work with patients she has found it possible to help and to cure with psychotherapeutic propositions that are of the cultural rather than the biological type. It also means that she believes that the use of interpretations of the genetic type is limited. It is interesting though, that the different use she makes of herself as a therapist, the differ</page><page sequence="41">117 ent therapeutic propositions she adheres to, leads also to a change in her own concept of psychoanalytic science in general. While we agree that it is useful to look for new ways, for new psychotherapeutic techniques, it seems to us that a rather careless overcoming of the old ways may end in dead-end streets rather than in an expansion of psycho analytic science. At a later point we shall take up again the problem of cultural versus biological factors. Another psychologist who turned against Freud's basic tenet of determinism in psychology was Otto Rank. He felt that will psychology would have to free itself from the despotic forces of the instincts, and he and other therapists assumed Freud's concept of the ego as a slave driven by the powerful instincts and a tyrannical superego. The ego was nothing more than a weak victim of stronger instinctual forces, ergo Freud did not believe in creative freedom. Others claimed that his therapy was purely negative, and the like. Again one can't help but be impressed by the apparent naivete particularly of a man like Otto Rank who was familiar with philosophy and of whom one might assume some awareness as to the nature of a scientific law. He thought so much in terms of an outmoded concept of causality that he as sumed laws to be despots, scientific causes to be kinds of tyrants, that he tried to free himself from all psychological theory and to go beyond psychology (A posthumous publica tion.) In this work he expounded the view that the psy chologist, that is, the therapist, has to go "beyond" psy chological science, cold deterministic science, in order to reach man, fellow man, again. Therapy is beyond science, that is, beyond determinism. Dr. Taft and others of the Pennsylvania School of Social Work have claimed that Freud was mainly a psychological research scientist, Otto Rank on the other hand a therapist, and therefore the faith of the former was placed in determinism while the latter negated determinism and believed in the freedom of the will. Again we have to free ourselves from the temptation of dealing with the philosophical issue rather than trying to under</page><page sequence="42">118 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. stand it in terms of its symbolic meaning. Rank indeed tried to go "beyond" the psychoanalytic theories of Freud. He left no doubt about his intentions. However, his com ments on determinism again are really comments on the nature of therapeutic propositions he suggested to be effec tive. If he said that it was the present as much as or more than the past that determined the life struggle of the in dividual he really told us that in working with his patients he analyzed the therapeutic relationship in terms of every day events rather than seeing in it certain similarities with past relationships of the patient as expressed through the concept of transference. Rank therefore speaks of relation ship rather than of transference which does not say any thing new about the nature of the particular relationship but about the nature of the therapeutic propositions to be used. His focus, then, was not research but therapy. It is not completely unjust if Dr. Taft refers to Freud's re search interest, to his intention to work also in the realm of genetic and dynamic propositions. But we doubt her cor rectness if she assumes that Freud's research that has per mitted the kind of therapy we know today is not needed anymore, is a thing of the past. It is as if she were trying to say that there is sufficient genetic and dynamic insight to permit for an unlimited expansion of the therapeutic function of psychoanalysis or any other kind of science. We are quite sure however that this is not really what she means. Hers is an attitude about teaching, about the training of a certain type of professional worker, about the creation of a certain type of interest as expressed in the training that is offered at the Pennsylvania School of Social Work for social workers who are to do functional case work." It is interesting, and Dr. Taft must certainly be aware of it, that there does hardly exist a psychotherapeutic school of "Rankians", and that his main influence is felt today in the realm of social work and has led to very constructive and useful changes in social work practice. It has helped towards the development of the concept of function of</page><page sequence="43">119 which we have made direct and indirect use in the pages past, and it has helped social workers to see their job rather than to think in terms of an abstract psychiatric theory. The relinquishment of Freud's determinism here simply means that one can help the social work client with his re quest if one makes proper use of the function of the agency and uses the present relationship between client and work er towards the objective. One must not get an abstract case history with the full past, with "all" causes; one does not need an empty diagnosis, one can give limited help in carry ing out one's function. Certain change is possible without the consideration of certain genetic and dynamic facts. We are surely doing an injustice to social workers if we seem to be satisfied with these very general and loose comments. But they may suffice to indicate that the social worker may quite frequently see his job differently than the therapist, that he will work not only with the client's self but with the function of the agency and the rules that govern the exercising of his function. Eligibility and requirements for service -can be used psychologically and as therapeutic propositions they have their place in everyday practice. On the other hand we see that this new "school" of social work rather than really trying to be beyond psychology is trying merely to give up Freud's metapsychology and developed its own. The group is young and creative but does not seem to have really overcome some of the difficulties mentioned in the beginning of our paper. Their slogans while indicative of a good many new trends, of a creative use and develop ment of the professional self, may lead to isolation if no attempt is made at integration. We see then through these few examples that the slogan of indeterminism in psychotherapy or social case work is a kind of battle cry, a signal that points mainly towards a new use of the therapeutic, the helping self, and as far as the system of psychiatric knowledge is concerned it aims at that part which deals with psychotherapeutic propositions. It may be correct to assume that new therapeutic</page><page sequence="44">120 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. propositions usually do lead to a different description of the genetic and dynamic aspects of psychology. The latter however does not follow out of logical necessity but has to do with the way psychologists change, "overcome" old atti tudes, and move away from those who have taught them. It is a personal problem rather than a scientific one. But in asmuch as research, particularly research into psychothera peutic methods, is tied up with the personal problems of the researchers, the therapists, it is of an important nature and deserves the interest of the profession. So far the in terest of the profession has dealt with it out of the need for defense, out of the need to debunk the new schools. The destructive aims, then, might give way to the efforts at integration. Or, do the authors, in suggesting this, still fall victim to the illusion of the Tower of Babel, the symbol of the kind of unity one thinks man has had in the dim past and which one has experienced, perhaps, in the days of one's own personal past? Ego Versus "Will The therapeutic problems that represent themselves in the disguised form of the pseudo-philosophical problem of de terminism versus indeterminism are expressed at times by different slogans. One speaks then of ego versus will psy chology. We think that both Alfred Adler and Otto Rank would prefer to speak of the will rather than the ego. The assumption again is that the ego is dependent on more power ful forces that give it the role of a passive victim of the in stinctual forces and the cruel super ego. This naive mis conception of certain constructs of Freud's metapsychology have been dealt with by many authors, and we find no necessity to discuss it once more beyond some of the com ments that have already been made. We feel it may be worthwhile however not to take the battle cry of "will psychology" at its dubious face value but to understand it in in terms of the decision it expresses with regard to psy</page><page sequence="45">121 chotherapy. The change of the construct stems from a change in therapy, and we suspect without being able to give a more concrete answer, that it also expresses the de cision to change the goals of therapy. One might put it differently by saying that it may well have been possible for Rank and other originators of new schools in psychology to develop their changes in therapeutic technique within the framework of Freudian metapsychology. The fact, though, that they were never fully aware of the true con sequences of a scientific theory, that they believed in Freud's metapsychology — unlike himself — in an almost religious, dogmatic manner, that they could not be different from their master without renouncing him and his language com pletely, led to the need for the construction of a new psy chological ideology. From now on it should be easier for the reader to follow our suggestions as we continue to take up some of the problems of psychological work as they present themselves in the disguise of ideological differences. That is, the true intention is disguised, but the disguise, as in the case of the neurotic symptom, may become a force of its own. The latter fact is the reason that most professional discussions today seldom hit the basic intention and seem to focus on the surface of the ideology. Libido and Cultural Factors It is for this reason that it seems modern these days to argue the problem ox Libido theory versus cultural fac tors. It is said of Freud and some of his "orthodox" fol lowers (without an effort to deny the hostile undertone) that because they grew up in the culture of Europe, in the Victorian age, etc., etc., they overstressed biological factors, and that the theory of the instincts must give way now to the cultural factors of the modern, the neo-Freudians. Un fortunately, there are so many opinions existing that one feels at times that each psychiatrist has his own concept of the problem. While we doubt that this is really unfortunate</page><page sequence="46">122 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. for everyday practice we believe it does not aid clarification. The authors have tried to reconcile the two points of views as expressed though the slogan "Libido versus cultural factors" in a recent paper. 21) They attempt to demon strate in that paper that there are no different "realms" of science, that any dividing line is arbitrary, and that the search for causes does not permit a differentiation between more or less important ones, and that it is incorrect there fore to assume that biological descriptions are more or less important than those that are of a cultural or social nature. The differences between biological and cultural factors was seen in terms of the "order of magnitude in time". The time factor thus introduced would suggest that the cultural factors are "superimposed" on the biological ones, and the inclination of the authors was then to consider the socio logical sciences essentially as biological ones. The authors see no reason to give up this point of view as long as they consider genetic and dynamic propositions. only. As long as psychoanalysis deals with "man in general", with a scientific description of his psychological development, with the general intent to broaden and deepen our knowledge about man, it will be useful to build genetic descriptions of a certain order of magnitude in time into broader ones that are of a different, that is, a larger dimension in time. To use an example from the physical sciences, the law of gravity is "only" a special case of more general laws describing the relationships between different elements of the solar system, and therefore one may want to think of it as a subordiûated law. This assumption does not carry any value point of view for the physicist. He knows what a scientific law is. Psychologists, though, seem to carry the value point of view right into the ideological struggle of the followers of the Libido theory and the ones who think "cultural factors" are more important. The authors' effort at integration, a kind of compromise between the two points of view, while applicable for science in general, for "pure" science, does not permit an examina</page><page sequence="47">123 tion of the problem with a view point such as that used in the present presentation. It does not deal with the problem of control, and does not clarify the nature of these control propositions, that is, the therapeutic propositions. If one were to follow the vicissitudes of the libido, the instinctual drives in man; if one were to trace their fate from their early "primitive" expressions up to the many differentia tions, sublimations, reaction formations, continuations, re pressions, or regressions as they are brought about through a combination of environmental influences of different quan tity and quality; or if one would rather want to describe man with the focus on the environmental influences, that is, the cultural factors, one would not really create two different psychological scientific systems. Both kinds of de scriptions would describe the same system, but for a different purpose. It seems to us that Freud's way of describing it did not stem from the Victorian age alone, nor can one explain his choice of metapsychology in terms of the sciences of his days. Of course, just as the classical physicists used every day language and everyday words such as "power", "cur rent", "energy" in order to create their system of classical physics, psychology too made use of what was available and several of the Freudian theories are patterned after certain scientific descriptions found elsewhere. The Libido theory uses many constructs and "ideas" from hydromechanics, and psychoanalytic topology makes use of terms that at first had spatial connotations. 22) Freud's choice of metapsy chology, his need for certain constructs, his preference for certain thinking patterns, is to be explained not only through his culture, the science of the 19th century, or his person ality but also through his purpose. Since he was a physician his focus was the patient, the patient's illness,»and the in stinct theory permitted him to look at the vicissitudes of man's drives first. His first interest was to find out what was ill and only then did he proceed to look for the forces that "acused" the illness. "We think that it was the atti</page><page sequence="48">124 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. tude of the doctor who works in terms of "differential diag nosis" that has contributed to a psychology that is not is olated from other sciences of life such as biology or physi ology. The choice of the "biological base" can't be under stood in terms of value, of a greater or lesser degree of im portance, but in terms of a search for a method of differ ential diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. It was a choice that yielded results, that is,, genetic and dynamic proposi tions that lead to certain therapeutic propositions, key propositions that can be used towards cure. However, these first discoveries led to many more. The first modfest theory of the unconscious, the depth psychology, permitted more and more understanding of the total person ality, and psychoanalysis developed into a psychology that describ'es not only the vicissitudes of the primitive tend encies, but also the vicissitudes of many other aspects of the personality such as The Defense Mechanism of the Ego. The new findings changed therapeutic technique considerably inasmuch as the therapist was able now to make use not only of his knowledge of the "unconscious forces" but of many other patterns as well. He learned to understand more and more what transference means in terms of rela tion to the analyst and to the world, what character means, and he also understood more and more of the subtle differ ences in family milieu; that one did not really find new techniques of interpretations but one found more to inter pret because one understood more, and it became apparent that the patient can be helped more effectively if the fullest use is made of any observation that is understood. Indeed, this led to a good many changes in theory too, and Freud's constant change of his metapsychology is certainly proof of his creative flexibility and also of the tremendous poten tialities in psychoanalytic theory that permit so much change and growth. One must only realize in amazement that he was 66 when he introduced the concept of the superego, that he revised his theory of anxiety when he was 70. These re visions simply mean that better, fuller descriptions have</page><page sequence="49">125 been found, which then permit more successful work with patients. One of the very vital findings of psychoanalysis was the phenomenon of countertransference. It permitted the intro duction of the role of the therapist into the therapeutic pro cess, to study him as a psychological tool and as a part of the therapeutic process. It permitted us to realize that chances for treatment success depend 011 his personality, his skills, certain strengths and weaknesses, his sensitivity for a particular patient's problems. One seems to agree today that the therapist develops his own way of helping, his own treatment personality, and in using himself as a therapeutic tool cannot go beyond his very self. In doing his work he gains certain convictions about therapy in gen eral and formulates them in therapeutic ideologies. He may overlook the personality factor and then found a school of psychology that gives the impression that essentially new genetic and dynamic discoveries had been made while it is true only that he has changed his own therapeutic proced ures in order to make the best possible use of his professional self. One therapist may be more attuned to subtle cultural influences that have molded the patient's life and his great est strength might be to sense them at the proper time and react to them as they are experienced and communicated by the patient. He, the therapist, might then "stress" cultural factors. This will be particularly true if his own analysis has made him believe in this kind of reaction to the patient. The way he has been indoctrinated will be followed up if the indoctrination was successful. That is true for the orthodox analyst as well. The previous remarks again have not been made in order to debunk one school, or to explain it away, but to point out that therapeutic propositions are not to be confused with genetic and dynamic ones, but have to be understood in terms of control. The orthodox analyst who works with a hysterical pa tient might react differently than the neo-Freudian and both</page><page sequence="50">126 Rudolf Elcstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. may think they do so on the basis of a different psychological theory. We are thinking of a young girl who suffers from anxiety hysteria. She suffers occasionally from violent head aches, particularly when in the company of her boy friend. She is afraid to meet him because she feels embarrassed if she has to admit these headaches. The orthodox analyst may interpret her symptom as an escape and punishment for sexual temptation, an effort to keep repressed forbidden instinctual tendencies. The other therapist may interpret her headaches as an escape from a "test situation", the working out of a personal relationship, and he may explain the significance of this test situation in terms of certain cultural requirements "in our time". Genetically and dynamically each of them has said the same. It is true that both have chosen different language but neither of them denies what the other is saying. The orthodox one who "be lieves in Libido" will certainly admit and use during the treatment process the knowledge that repression cannot be fully understood without a suppressing environment, and he is aware that "reality" is not an unchangeable thing but a dynamic concept. The modern who "believes in cultural factors" will not deny that a part of the test situation has to deal with the concept of sex that is permissible in our cul ture that forces this young woman to be unaware of her sexual desires, to have no conscious knowledge of them; and he will hardly deny that these sexual desires are of a biolog ical origin. Even if he were to outhorney Dr. Horney he would admit that man's penis and the woman's vagina are not cultural factors, but he may say that we "overempha size" certain biological factors. The difference then aims at therapy. Both may claim now that their respective way is the better one, and both no doubt have many successful cases to report and to sub stantiate their claims. But, isn't it true perhaps that their own treatment personality, not just their theoretical con vicion (their psychological dogmas) decide how they will be able to use themselves and what kind of system of com</page><page sequence="51">127 munication they have developed in talking with their pa tients? They have developed therapeutic eyes, and thera peutic blind spots according to their own personality, and this will affect the kind of dogmas they choose. We are reminded of the quotation from Marx (cited in the intro duction) according to which the philosophers should not just interpret the world differently but should think of the job of change. We are tempted to paraphrase him: "Die Psychoanalytiker haben die Patienten verschieden inter pretiert, es kommt aber darauf an sie zu verandern." (The psychoanalysts have interpreted the patients differently but it's their job to change them). This reminds us that therapeutic propositions are really "change" propositions, and as in the case of medicine do not explain but are designed to help, to cure, to change. This brings us back to the thought of the "Allmacht der Gedanken". Isn't the idea that these different kinds of interpretations are of tremendous importance in helping the patient return to the Bible myth? Isn't it an overes timation of their significance if we really seem to think that some of these differences in verbal reaction to the patient are of utmost importance, even warrant a change of meta psychology, of analytic theory? These questions are not of a rhetorical nature but aim at a clarification of the thera peutic process as had been attempted in Dr. Bellak's paper, A Note on Some Basic Concepts of Psychotherapy. 23) It is an interesting sidelight in this ideological struggle of psychological thought that the lay world has taken sides also, and that particularly the newer groups find it very important to exercise an educational function and to en lighten the people on psychological and psychiatric issues. During this education, or group indoctrination if you please, efforts are made to drive home the correctness of the con victions of the newer groups and to "debunk" the old fashioned. Liberal and other groups interested in social change have turned against the "conservative" Freud and his</page><page sequence="52">128 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. "biological base" and have found comfort in the stressing of the "cultural factors". The psychological significance of this is clear, inasmuch as these groups think consciously or unconsciously in terms of social control. They are in terested in those propositions that lend themselves to key propositions in social propaganda, in social engineering. The "more important" causes are the ones that permit con trol. Social engineering may help to control neurosis as a mass phenomenon but it cannot be used for the cure for one particular individual. Freud was not a social engineer but a psychotherapist (although he had mentioned jokingly that the whole world was his patient). Interpersonal Relationships Another interesting deviation from Freudian psycho analysis is that of a group of psychiatrists who are follow ing the lead of H. S. Sullivan, Clara Thompson, Erich Fromm, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, and others. Their slogan which holds that "psychiatry is the science of inter personal relations" has been elaborated upon by Sullivan. He expresses his basic view of psychiatry as follows: "Psychiatry, instead, is the study of processes that involve or go on between people. The field of psychiatry is the field of interpersonal relations, under any and all circumstances in which these relations exist. It was seen that a personality can never be isolated from the complex of interpersonal relations in which the person lives and has his being. Definitions of this kind cannot be understood if we treat them in the traditional manner and try to show up their logical shortcomings. We will hardly understand the Sullivan point of view if we ask him ironically as to the advisability of including education in psychiatry since it certainly is a field of interpersonal relationships. We will also hardly benefit from the objection that treatment methods such as a frontal lobectomy while of a psychiatric nature</page><page sequence="53">129 do not seem to fit his definition. His definition is a declara tion of the intention to describe any kind of emotional or mental disturbance that is of a functional origin in terms of the interpersonal relationship, or the chain of inter personal relationships, that "caused" it. He and his group are mainly interested in these dynamic and genetic propo sitions that describe the significant personal relationships of a particular individual in order to arrive at therapeutic control propositions that can be used towards cure. This group is interested in the propositions that describe the "inter" of interpersonal relationships and its pathological effects. Everything else is left out or "minimized" as is possible when one's efforts are directed at therapeutic propositions only. It is true indeed that even these pro cesses that are usually described under the traditional head ing of Maturation can be described fully only if we take into account the interpersonal relations of the particular individual. The therapist might well be able to afford the luxury of denying or minimizing the effect of puberty changes and stress the peculiar nature of the interpersonal relationships, during these formative years. Of course nobody in the group mentioned denies the biological aspects of puberty, of masturbation, or of one's basic attitudes towards parents, the opposite sex, etc., but it seems left out of the psychiatric ideology and Freud's conten tions in regard to The Three Theories of Sex are distilled to descriptions of interpersonal relationships. All psychiatrists today — if they believe in psychotherapy at all — realize quite well that treatment is only a specific case of an interpersonal relationship, and they must find Sullivan's ideology attractive since it focuses their attention on . the job of therapy, on therapeutic propositions. It will be shown at a later point why Freud's concept of trans ference, for example, led us farther than Sullivan's or Rank's concept of "relationship" ever would. The new language, then, is mainly an indication of certain changes or stresses in therapy and as far as genetic and dynamic propositions are concerned has not yet grown towards a</page><page sequence="54">130 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. theory of personality of its own. As is the case with most of the other schools it lives on refutation, on negation of certain contentions of Freudian analysis but has not yet developed its own psychology. It should be suggested at this point, however, that in the opinion of the authors the differences between the different schools is most likely not only a difference in language, in general slogans, or even in therapy. Explicit, genuine differences have not been clearly defined as yet but one may assume that differences in genetic and dynamic propositions are implied though not yet formulated. They will have to be formulated and they will have to be exposed to the reality test of scientific pro cedure. Non-Directive Therapy Non-directive psychotherapy was an outgrowth of the feeling that "direct" counselling did not lead anywhere. 24) It was the result of the growing feeling that behaviorism is limited in its application in a helping process. Realizing that there are certain dynamic factors in the personality which cannot be changed willfully, this school of psycho therapeutic thought went to the other extreme : the thera pist is supposed to be entirely nondirective, passive, and the patient is supposed to find the solution which is best for him practically spontaneously. This attitude seems based on the faith that the truth will out, and that, if nature is left alone, all will turn to the best. The passive attitude seems in part to have been adopted from the classical atti tude of the psychoanalyst without taking into consideration the special skills which he uses as derived from psychoanalytic theory and observation. The followers of this trend of thought in the thera peutic field seem to have given up any effort toward es tablishing a generic psychology of their own and are quite frank in indicating that their effort is merely directed at therapy and that they only describe aspects that are impor</page><page sequence="55">131 tant for psychotherapeutic practice. One has almost the impression that they leave out what goes on in a person and study only what goes on between, that is "inter" two persons, in the psychotherapeutic relationship. "We are thinking for example of Carl R. Roger's non-directive thera py which is closely related to the work of such authors as Rank, Taft, and Allen. Their publications seem to deny or weaken almost every contention of Freudian psychoanalysis but one wonders here too if this is not a way of declaring that they are interested in psychotherapeutic propositions only. At least so far a positive psychology of their own has not been formulated. They have succeeded in develop ing their treatment methods, their personal attitudes in the psychotherapeutic relationship. That may imply a generic theory of personality as well but this theory has not been explicitly formulated and therefore cannot be exposed to the test of scientific evidence. Psychotherapy in its present stage has not yet developed to a point where its success or failure can be used as evi dence for or against a theory. 25) Or, to put it in other words, genetic and dynamic propositions in psychology are not proven just because psychotherapeutic propositions lead to cure. Psychotherapeutic control is only one particular way, and an uncertain way too, to demonstrate that our un derstanding of a personality is genuine and permits scien tific prediction and understanding. A Relativistic Point of View The examples touched upon have been used to demon strate that the different slogans of therapy are mainly an expression of the type of control, of psychotherapeutic ac tivity, that is used. It might well be that they imply major changes in the realm of genetic and dynamic descriptions as well, but for the time being it seems that the differences as to what "causes" a particular psychological pattern refer really to these key sentences that permit control.</page><page sequence="56">132 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. The suggestion that the selection of "the cause" refers to control propositions or therapeutic propositions is de rived from certain changes in therapy as advocated by dif ferent schools of psychology. It is an arbitrary decision, often arbitrary in more than one sense. It is arbitrary in as much as we have no convincing, final proof as to what works, what "causes" in therapy, that is, what kind of therapeutic directions produce change, and ALSO in refer ence to the theoretical "system" selected. We were in terested in the system of control propositions, that is, in the area of control. However there is also a more general area, the area of Prediction : For example, certain childhood at titudes brought about through the educational measures of the mother "produce" a certain character which means that we can predict adult attitudes. The genetic propositions that are used to predict adult dynamics are then "the cause". But one must not use the same propositions in relation to control. In this sense it is possible to say that certain genetic propositions of psychoanalysis may be wrong if used as therapeutic ones. And someone who is interested in the area of control only may be tempted to mistake his control propositions for genetic ones. He may mistake con trol causes for causes that allow for predictions. Our view then seems to be relativistic. Einstein's new theory of relativity obviates the bitter quarrel between the followers of Ptolemy and those of Copernicus. Basically, both descriptions can be used towards correct prediction. As it happens the former is impracticable and therefore abandoned. The ideological warfare between the two groups was really ended as soon as we fully understood the impli cations of their different modes of description. On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that certain empirical dis coveries, improvements of tools, etc., require a good many minor changes of the theory even though the basic view point of the two groups can be maintained even today. "What, then, is dogmatic in science, and particularly, in psy chological science? It is not the fact, the observation, the</page><page sequence="57">133 evidence. What is dogmatic is the choice of language, the particular purpose or function of our activity. Religious dogma holds that certain "facts" are beyond the need of proof. Scientific dogma holds that certain basic decisions in regard to the choice of language, one's basic ideology, in regard to one's purpose, are beyond the need of proof. The proof that is rejected by the religious is to test reality. The scientist rejects quite frequently "proof" of his language, his basic ideology, his basic purposes. 26) We do not use the language of Ptolemy any more be cause it is impractical and obstructs scientific progress and would make impossible the development of modern astron omy just as Roman figures would not enable us to develop modern calculus. The ones who hold on to impractical descriptions hold on not to religious dogma but to the scien tific dogma of unchangeable descriptive patterns. The re ligious dogma denies the scientific test of reality contentions and the scientific one — or should we say the logical dogma — prevents us from a fuller exploration of reality. Our Dogma, Choice and Awareness The authors, as will be clear to the reader by now, also of course, have a psychiatric ideology. The ideological nucleus of their psychological convictions consists in the choice of psychoanalytic metapsychology, that is, psycho analytic descriptive structures, even though they have tried to integrate certain findings of other schools. It might seem difficult to understand why we attempt at first to tear down what we have called the dogma in psychological science, and then confess not only that we have sinned but that we shall continue to hold on to Freud ian metapsychology. The feeling of strangeness might give way however to an identification with a process of clarifica tion that was not really aiming at semantic destruction but at an evaluation of our professional selves and at an attempt towards growth and integration. The paper indeed is a</page><page sequence="58">134 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. projection of our own struggle with the intellectual and pro fessional environments we have been exposed to, an attempt to overcome, not in others but in ourselves, the sin of the unconscious dogma in science. It is difficult to discover why on« holds on to a certain psychological ideology. We are quite aware that the very first "psychological climate" in which one grows up, one's own personal analysis, one's gratitude to teachers, one's allegiance to the group, one's desire to meet with approval, and one's difficulty in giving up a certain mental set, 1liat all these factors tend to establish a definite pattern, a defin ite psychological ideology, that is not only a knowledge of and an interest in certain facts but also a preference for a certain language in order to describe it, certain theories that seem to lend themselves best towards understanding and prediction. However, there is more to it. Our preference for Freudian metapsychology stems from our conviction that it has the greatest heuristic value. We may find it difficult to explain just what we mean when we employ the term Libido but we may prefer to hold on to this mythologi cal concept, this psychoanalytic dogma because it helped us to learn a great deal about the workings of the human mind. We may not quite know what to do about the vague concept of the unconscious but again it brought us nearer to the understanding of the psychology of personality. One might want to accept Sullivan's suggestion and say that a person is "unaware" of a certain tendency in him rather than fol low Freud's metapsychology and say that he is uncon scious of this tendency. No doubt much and perhaps all we know about a particular person can be expressed in the language that is suggested by Sullivan. One may give up concepts such as repression and say that somebody puts something out of awareness, and that is at times quite useful in therapeutic work when one speaks to the patient, but the authors wonder if it would have been possible with this type of language to find out what is meant for example by re gression. We speak of practical impossibility rather than</page><page sequence="59">135 logical impossibility. One could think of a logical and mathematical genius who could have invented calculus with Roman figures. While this is plausible one is justified in saying that it is practically impossible. Again, it is plaus ible that someone might have been able to find certain psy chological laws in employing the term of relationship only, rather than using the one of transference. But we realize that the choice of the term permitted the practical solution of many psychological problems even though a certain vagueness about it may give rise to a good many misunder standings. The vagueness of psychoanalytic concepts, the fact that Freud and others applied them loosely and changed their meanings frequently was attacked, and the discontent of the academic research psychologist who tried to put these concepts to the test of rigorous laboratory requirements was one of the many causes of strong resistance against the new science. It seems to us that the nature of the field demanded that kind of language. The theories of psycho analysis proved to be flexible and permitted change and wide application. Freud's metapsychology can be compared to a field without clear boundaries. It is open for expansion as soon as more objective data are available and permit such expansion. The lack of boundaries of course has its draw backs also, and at times the searching mind gets lost in the fog of unexplored fields, and his half-familiarity with the foggy borderland may induce him to rush formulations and assumptions that will not stand up against more careful inquiries. We may then get lost and presume a poorly de fined death instinct or a trauma of birth, or we may apply psychoanalytic principles to other scientific areas in the social sciences, not being sure of the foundation of all science, the fact, and quite unclear about the language elements that are to serve the function of description and explanation. It is the task of the psychological worker, then, to con tinuously recheck his facts, to find new ones and to be aware of the language tools he is using. He must continuously</page><page sequence="60">136 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. ♦ examine his language and its psychological implications in terms of selection of fields of interest. He must be aware of the ideological part of his science, and while he may hold on to his particular pet dogmas in science, he must not close his eyes and be afraid to examine them. Whenever the limitations of his ideological structure in science become apparent in doing a particular job he will have to change some of the ideological structure or give it up completely. One may think again of the example Freud set us when he was willing to limit the mythological concept of Libido and permitted the introduction of aggression in terms of the death instinct. He changed major parts of the ideological structure of psychoanalysis when he was 64 and later when he was 70 years of age. While a particular theory with all its ideological implications may hold us in its spell, we must never forget that its value is in describing all psychological facts rather than forcing us to "adjust" the facts to its implied dogma. Suggestions and Outlook While the above may suggest a different outlook on psy chiatric and psychological theories it is in its present form a mere stimulus at best for research along such lines. We ought to be interested in the personality of the psychiatrist and its influence upon his particular choice of ideology. The contention that different psychiatric ideologies refer mainly to changes in therapy can be examined on a laboratory level. Completely recorded analyses of psychiatrists of different schools can be examined from the point of view of the language and content structure of interpretations used, and from the point of view of their effect. Psychiatrists of different schools rather than refuting their opponents would have to try to state their theories and findings in positive and explicit terms. The effort would have to be made to overcome the habit of stating differences in broad "irre futable" philosophical terms in order to allow scientific</page><page sequence="61">137 checking. An effort also ought to be made to understand completely the true meanings of one's own ideology, pod to understand the other school as well. We must reexamine our goals, and we must try to communicate with each other rather than hiding from each other through voluntary school ghettos, through unclear language. All these suggestions will not wipe out differences but they may aid towards the creation of a more productive research climate for all of us. Ours is a young and expand ing science with an unexplored field, and with rapid advance into unknown regions. It is for this reason that a never ending effort towards clarification, towards rechecking, to wards getting together must be made. Even now, in clos ing this paper we begin to be dissatisfied with the small degree of clarity we have achieved. The achievement of clarity in our work, in our function, is a continued process. The process we have in mind is not only an intellectual one. It is an emotional one as well, a psychological process of rise in clarity that does not permit us to stop climbing. In the field of philosophy a similar suggestion has been made by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. He suggests that we throw away the ladder of analysis after we have climbed up on it. But since psychological science does not know any boundaries we must continue climbing and thus require new ladders of clarification. The task of the psychological worker, then, is to understand himself and others. Such understanding includes an examination of his tools of understanding, his descriptive and explaining means. And this task is not only an intellectual one for thé learned mind. It requires an emotional maturity that per mits growth. We might well say that it needs a strong faith, a strong ideology that includes the intellectual as well as the emotional aspects of man. Our own ideology thus can be expressed best in the words of Sigmund Freud: "THE VOICE OF THE INTELLECT IS SOFT BUT IT IS PERSISTENT".</page><page sequence="62">138 Rudolf Ekstein, M.S.S., Ph.D. FOOTNOTES 1.

It is perhaps well to recall that the two words do not refer to totally different sciences but have derived their present meaning from a culturally-influenced division of labor. Freud spoke of himself as a psychologist though we would prefer perhaps to call him a psychiatrist, since the main intent of his endeavors was directed at an attempt to cure. Psychological work with a psycho therapeutic intent is preferably called psychiatry, while the name psychology is reserved for activities that aim at research, at meas uring, at testing, etc. It is evident, though, that a number of psychiatric activities, in fact, a great part of the field of psy chiatry, is non-psychological in nature. It is also more and more accepted that a great part of the work of the psychologist is psychotherapeutic in nature. It will be increasingly difficult to arrive at a meaningful description of the difference between psy chology and psychiatry, since it will hardly prove satisfactory to seek the difference in license, in vested interest. 11.
