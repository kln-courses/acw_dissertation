<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stanistaw Lem, Mortal Engines, trans, from the Polish with an Introduction by Michael Kandel. New York: The Seabury Press, 1977. Pp. xxiv, 239. Mortal Engines is a Lem sampler. Eleven short "Fables for Robots"are followed by a Ijon Tichy and a Pilot Pirx story, then a longer and weirder tale "The Mask." Except for the fable "Tale of the Computer That Fought a Dragon," which appeared in Darko Suvin's collection of East European science fiction, Other Worlds, Other Seas [1970], all of these works appear for the first time in English. Readers already acquainted with Lem's ingenious technology-based world of fantasy will delight in this collection, those still unaware of Eastern Europe's finest science-fiction writer have a treat in store for them. The Robot Fables are Kunstmarchen by, for, and about mechanical humanoids interacting in various mythological areas of the universe. Brass, iron, and quartz electroknights try to invade a frigid planet of beautiful, twinkling multicolored lights ("Three Electroknights"). A tyrant rules another planet made entirely of heavy metals ("Uranium Earpieces"). A real human being ("paleface") outwits royal robot captors ("Erg the Self-Inducting") and The Word, destructively creative in this instance, is uttered by machines on a globe where even time is controlled ("Two Monsters"). We read about a world of subterranean creations in "White Death"and are given a folksy explanation for why we are part of an expanding universe in "Microx and Gigant." Some of the fables recall Old Testa ment sagas, others Greek or Roman mythology and The Arabian Nights. One,</page><page sequence="2">106 The Polish Review "Automatthew's Friend," brings to mind the early satiric stories of Lem's com patriot Slawomir Mrozek. Reading them, one wonders whether Lem is not also familiar with the children's stories of Dr. Seuss. Good fables for wee robots, we find them amusing because of their wit and because they satirize human failings. Robots after all are anthropomorphic and possess both man's strengths and weaknesses. In "Sanatorium of Dr. Vliperdius" philosophical earthling Ijon Tichy (whose Star Diaries appeared in English last year) visits a mental hospital for psychotic robots. The story is slightly mocking: a hypochondriac patient, for example, lugs behind him a cart full of spare parts. "The Hunt," on the other hand, is a lunar western whose hero, the practical-minded Pilot Pirx, skillfully though reluctantly reduces to a puddle a nearly invincible Moon mining robot. Finally, "The Mask,"a first-person narrative of an avenging, death-inflicting female robot, is without question Mortal Engines' most sinister tale. Lem's characteristic humor is absent from it and, even more disquieting, here and there the work is melodramatic. Michael Kandel prefaces Mortal Engines with eighteen pages of introductory comments on monsters, robots, cybernetics, and Lem's oeuvre. Students of litera ture, in particular fantastic literature, may question some of his observations and conclusions. One of the most striking aspects of much of Lem's fiction (and nonfiction) is humor. If there is Angst in Lem's creations as Kandel implies, then it must be understood as ironic Angst. The translations in Mortal Engines are superb. The texts are remarkably smooth. It is hard to praise Kandel adequately for his ability to render Lem's verbal acrobatics so skillfully. Any random comparison of the English nonce words used and their Polish originals confirms this statement. (The present reviewer wonders if a robot invented the four additional, slightly off-color lines given in the English version of the poem opening "Sanatorium of Dr. Vliperdius"since the lines are not found in the Polish edition cited as the source.) It is to be hoped that Kandel will continue to translate Lem's works. Perhaps he will be able to publish English versions of Lem's essays. Hopefully Kandel will receive the recognition he so rightfully deserves for his most successful efforts to promulgate this most im portant phenomenon of twentieth-century Polish literature in the U.S. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign THOMAS H.
