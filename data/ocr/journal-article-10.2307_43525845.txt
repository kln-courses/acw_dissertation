<plain_text><page sequence="1">Precedence and Innovation in the Bilingual Nabataean Inscription at cEn cAvdat David Larsen1 Abstract Most readings of the cEn cAvdat inscription take its first Arabic line as a statement of the dedicanti motives, whether in abnegation or pursuit of some "benefit" (Arabic lã/ti-fida). This reading takes it instead as an assertion of cultic legitimacy, in which the dedication of a statue (Aramaic sbri) to Obodas the God is defended as "no de- parture" (Arabic lā forran ) from legitimate Nabataean worship. Where many have scanned its lines for primitive forms of Arabic poetry, it is here suggested that the inscription's "poetic" content has more in common with Arabic huťba and sag than the verse forms known from the pre-Islamic corpus. Throughout the 20th-century controversy over the "authenticity" of the pre- Islamic corpus of Arabic poetry, one point at least was granted by most scholars: In all of pre-Islamic poetry there is not one verse of which it can be affirmed that it was recorded in pre-Islamic times. Nor can it be claimed that its transmitters and preservers had any pre-Islamic in- scriptive sources for it, since it was handed down orally [into the Islamic period]. On this well-known point, not one authority could boast that their fund of poetry came from pre-Islamic books or scrolls or any other written materials dating from the period; all the pre- Islamic poetry which has reached us is from the age of the written record, which begins with Islam.2 1 Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University, P.O.

Larsen Seven years after the appearance of these remarks in Gawãd cAl!,s 1972 "History of the Arabs Before Islam", a 6-line inscription in Nabataean char- acters was discovered on a rock face at cEn cAvdat, in the Negev region of Israel, by A. Roones of Ben-Gurion University's Institute for Desert Research (now the Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research).3 The first part of this inscription (a dedication to Obodas, a deified king of the Nabataeans) is in Aramaic, but two of its lines were identified right away as a North Arabi- an dialect very close to Classical Arabic. With a terminus ante quern of 150 CE assigned by Avraham Negev, the inscription at cEn cAvdat predates what was previously the earliest-known Arabic inscription (the al-Namāra inscrip- tion of 328 CE) by over a century.4 What is more, the lines were soon found to have the appearance of poetic discourse - not the rhymed verses of Classical Arabic poetry, but more ancient Semitic poetic forms characterized by an unrhymed tonic line of four stressed beats and a predilection for was Imru, al-Qays. Also cited is a legend spread by Hammād al-Rāwiya (d. 155/772) of a book in which al-Nucmān IV (last king of al-Hīra, ca. 580-602 CE) had ordered the best poetry of his day be recorded and laid up in his castle. This is not to say that knowledge of writing was altogether lacking among the poets of pre-Islamic Arabia; cAiJ notes that cAdī b. Zayd (d. ca. 600 CE) and Muraqqiš the Elder (d. ca. 550 CE) were both instructed in it. Translations from Arabic and Greek are by me. My thanks go to Dr. John L. Hayes and Masha Gutkin for the loan of their time and expertise. 3 Avraham Negev (with J. Naveh and S. Shared): "Obodas the God". Israel Exploration Journal , 36: 1-2 (1986), 56-60. 4 "The date of our inscription probably falls between 88/9 and 125/6 CE, but in any case no later than 150 CE, when the Nabataean- Aramaic inscriptions were no longer written at Oboda" (ibid., 60). This dating is upheld by Moshe Sharon, "Corpus inscriptionum arabicarum Palaestinae" (Leiden: Brill, 1997), vol. 1, 194, but questioned by Giancarlo Lacerenza, who references a Nabataean Aramaic in- scription near cAvdat which is self-dated to the month of Ab, 205 CE. "Appunti sull'iscrizione nabateo-araba di cAyn cAvdat", Studi epigrafici e linguistici , 17 (2000), 108-9. Nota bene that the cEn cAvdat inscription was at no time the earliest known Arabic-language text on record: in the year of its discovery, a 10- line inscription (in South Arabian characters) from Qaryat al-Faw, dating to the end of the first century BCE, was published by cAbd al-Rahmãn al-Ansãry: "Adwã' jadīda calā dawlat Kinda min hilāl ātār Qaryat al-Faw wa-nuqūšihā", in: Sources for the History of Arabia , ed. by Abdelgadir Mahmoud Abdalla, Sami al-Sakkar, and Richard T.

With varying degrees of persuasiveness critics have identified formal and syntactic analogies between the cEn cAvdat inscription and the Qur'an and Gāhilī poetry.7 5 I. Sh.

Larsen Although Testen differs with Negev et al. on the reading of } T D their interpretations share a minority position in reading lines 4 and 5 as one uni- fied composition. Most scholars who find a poetic composition contained in the Arabic lines indicate its beginning after 'TD1 in line 4, reducing the in- scription's poetic content to one couplet: pknhn3 y bc n} } Imtwl3 &gt; bc h /pknhn}}DDgDhwl}yDDn' On this fragment, the majority opinion is expressed by I. Sh. Shifman: "It is unlikely that the lines included in the inscription might have been composed by the same person who made the inscription; they rather appear as a fragment of some very common poetic composition, like a prayer-psalm uttered during a service in the temple."10 Where one locates the beginning of the interpolated fragment matters a great deal, affecting as it does the interpretation of the whole in- scription. Among the attractions of Testen's reading are the heightened assonance of the pair U-üfara wa-lã }ütara and its syntactic analogy to the two sentences which follow.11 If however the first half of line 4 is exempted from the poem, the advantages of Testen's reading are diminished, the "restored" parallelism of those passive optative clauses appearing somewhat forced. An important re-framing of the cEn cAvdat inscription has been given by Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila, who proposes that it be read as three lines of Aramaic followed by three lines of Arabic, against the prevailing tendency to treat the Arabic as an interpolation within an Aramaic-language docu- ment.12 In this reading the Arabic portion is not subordinated, but is con- strued paratactically as the inscription's concluding half. In no case can this shift in code be evaluated in a vacuum, and until a typology of Nabataean diglossia is established a working interpretation of the cEn cAvdat inscrip- tion remains in doubt. Negev's surmise that, because its engraver "could not find the words in the language which the Nabataeans normally used for writing, he turned to his spoken language" inspires little confidence, given that mere linguistic competence is only one factor among many to be con- sidered in such cases (and furthermore that where the Aramaic of the first 10 Shifman, "Novaia nabateiskaia dvuiazychnaia", 117, as translated by Noja, "A further discussion of the Arabic Sentence", 187. 11 Testen, "On the Arabic of the cEn cAvdat Inscription", 287. 12 Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila, "A note on the cEn cAvdat inscription", Studia Oňentatia, 67 (1991), 35; see however Testen, "On the Arabic of the cEn cAvdat Inscription", 281.</page><page sequence="7">Precedence and Innovation in the Bilingual Nabataean Inscription 11 three lines can be read it has not been found lacking in correctness).13 The shift in code might be attributed to the use of Arabic within Nabataean cult, as noted by Epiphanius.14 Alternately, it might be an expression of sub-group membership, or individual distinction. Also worth noting is that the Ara- maic half of the inscription names Garm'alahi as the dedicant of a statue which presumably stood nearby, while the Arabic half identifies him as the actual engraver. To the inscription's overlooked final line ("Garm'alahi wrote this with his own hand") we might add the metalingual gloss, "And he did so in the language of the Arabs." Most of those who read atar in the w 1 3 3 T D 3 of line 4 do so in the sense of "favor"; Reuven Snir vowels it as ítrďan meaning "to be rich".15 Both words appear to stem from the idea of a mark or brand [uira] placed on the feet of livestock, in order that its owner be identifiable from the animal's footprints; IVth form 'atara means to "mark as one's own" and so to "choose," "prefer" and "favor". An alternative reading of ' T D 3 is suggested by a hadit in which cUmar b. al-Hattāb recalls his onetime habit of swearing 13 Negev, "Obodas the God", 60. 14 Born in Palestine, Epiphanius was made bishop of Salamis on Cyprus in 366. His Panarion ["Cure-all"] was composed in 374-6, and describes the beliefs and practices of eighty different sects throughout history. Epiphanius refers to Nabataeans in the course of his chapter on the Alogoi ("Those who do not accept the Word of John the Evangelist"), mentioning a rite celebrated "in the city of Petra, capital of Arabia, which is called Edom in the scripture. There in the idol's temple [the rite] happens in this way, and they use an Arab language to hymn the virgin goddess, calling her Chaamou, that is Korē or "virgin" in Arabic. And the one born from her [they call] Düsáres, that is "Sole Begotten of the Lord": touto 8è Kai év néTpçt rř' jiôXei mhtpójioXiç 8é écrri tíiç ÄpaßLcu;, htiç éoTÍv 'EScb|j rļ év Tatç ypacpalç yeypauMévn, év Tcp éiceiae eí8u)A.elu&gt; outcjdç ylveTai Kai ÄpaßiKrj SioAìktcu e^upivoOai Trļv jtapGévov KaXouvTeç aÙTr|v ÄpaßioTi XaaMOö toutéotiv Koprļv €iV oùv jiapGévov Kai tòv aÙTrjç veyewriMévov Aouoaprļv toutéotiv piovoyevn tou ôeajiÓTOu.

The Kitab al-Aymän ["Book of Oaths"] of Muslim's Sahīh opens with this hadit, on the authority of cUmar himself via his son cAbd Allah and grandson Šālim: "The Prophet (God's blessings and peace be upon him) said: 'God (be He exalted and magnified) forbids you to swear an oath upon your fathers.' cUmar continued: 'And by God I have not taken an oath in this way, dakiran wa-lã 3ātiran, since I heard it forbidden by God's Prophet (God's blessings and peace be upon him)."16 The Imam al-Nawaw! glosses the phrase as follows: "The meaning of dakiran is '[not] repeating it after another,' and lã 3ãtiran means '[not] basing my oath on anyone else's.'"17 Might w 1 3 3 T D 3 be construed in a similar spirit? That spirit being an idiosyncratic display of devotion?

Where this reading fails to satisfy is on a poetic level, as David Testen observes: Seeing in the aleph of p-D- the representation of a vowel resulting from a lost semivocalic final radical, as the editors and the majority of those following them have taken it, has the unintended effect of ascribing the final 3 shared by the conjuncts p-D-3 and t-D -3 to mere coincidence.

Larsen It will be noted that the flight referred to here is not strictly a matter of cultic practice, but an actual flight to Syria.22 Unlike the verb 'atara (which for had 'it scholars means to attribute a tradition to some authority, either falsely or in truth), farra took on no specialized religious meaning in the Islamic period. It is not however necessary to venture one for the Nabataean period in order to read lines 3 and 4 of the cEn cAvdat inscription as follows: 3. (Aramaic) Garm'alahi son of Taym'alahi [sets up] a statue before Obodas the god. 4. (Arabic) And he does [so] neither turning away [from established practice] nor in emulation [of another]. If this reading is correct, then what looked like a preoccupation with favor or reward is revealed as a preoccupation with precedence, and an inno- vation which is acknowledged [īd 'ātirariļ even as it is disavowed [lā forran ]. The question then becomes: in what aspects could Garm'alahi's dedication have been felt to innovate? By itself the dual use of Arabic and Aramaic in the inscription is not likely to be the answer, given Negev's assurance that "In other Nabataean inscriptions of this period too there are Arabic words and phrases".23 More compelling is Negev's idea that Garm'alahi's dedication of an idol [Aramaic slm ] represented a departure from the aniconic betyls more typical of Nabataean worship. Based on this norm, Manfred Kropp goes so far as to insist that the slm was a representation of no god but of a person, since "For statues or symbols of deities the words nsyb or msgd are more likely".24 In terms of Nabataean custom this may be so, and yet Kropp's notion that Obodas's slm was not an object of cultic devotion is hard to accept. The force with which Aramaic slm was understood as "idol" may be gathered from the worship at Taymã' of a god named Salm, attested also in Akkadian, Aramaic, Thamūdic and Lihyanite personal names, and in Nabataean worship as well.25 Dictionary of 22 Narrated in Ibn HišAm's Síra nabawiyya, ed. by Mustafa al-SaqqA, IbrähIm al-AbvārI, and cAbd al-HafTz Šalabī (Cairo: Matba'at Mustafa al-Bābī al-Halabï, 1936), vol. 4, 578-81; repeated by Ibn Katīr, vol. 4, 123-6). 23 Negev, "Obodas the God", 60. 24 Manfred Kropp, "A puzzle of old Arabic tenses and syntax: The inscription of cEn 'Avdat."

Negev takes him to be Obodas II, who ruled from 30 to 9 BCE. This was the apogee of Nabataean power in its prosperous Middle Period, coinciding with the Pax Romana which followed the battle of Actium in 31 BCE. The earliest monumental architecture in the Negev desert dates to this period, and intensive building activity is recorded at Petra as well.28 Yet Obodas II is not remembered as a heroic or particularly effective king, and was in his own time overshadowed by Herod the Great of Judaea (37-4 BCE); Bowersock calls him "a weak ruler."29 Another candidate for deification is Obodas I, who was victorious against the Hasmoneans in 93 BCE and in 87 freed the Nabataeans from Seleucid rule with his defeat of King Antiochus XII.30 It may be that formal worship of Obodas the God was instituted during the reign of Obodas II, or perhaps after his death.31 In all events it is clear from the late lst/mid 2nd-c. CE cEn cAvdat inscription that Obodas was worshiped at his namesake city in the form of a statue. Perhaps the anthropomorphic sim was felt to be more 26 J. Hoftijzer and K.

(Leuven: Uitgeverij Peeters, 2001), 141-2 (§17.4) for the shift I &gt; n in North Arabian. 27 As such Garm'alahi's observance was not altogether without precedent, as shown by the dedication of a slmc to Obodas the God recorded at Petra in 20 CE.

Larsen appropriate for a deified king than the square-hewn betyls (byt % "house of god") standing for Dušarā, Allât, al-cUzzā, etc. which were called nsb and mstí by the Nabataeans.32 Nor can a Hellenizing or Romanizing aspect be excluded from the dedication of a statue in preference to a betyl - an aspect Garnťalahťs mid-inscription shift into Arabic may have been calculated to offset. As for the poetic fragment seemingly contained in lines 4 and 5 of the inscription, I offer little in the way of new conjecture. The parallel structure of the two conditional sentences (if not their syntax) is familiar from classical Arabic poetics; nor does their sentiment (as best as this can be determined) seem out of place. Naveh and Shaked's reading of ģurh ["wound, affliction"] for g D h in line 5 appears to me particularly strong in light of Sūrat yĀl cImrān (3:140).33 If this and the other exempla garnered from hadit, síra and the Qur'an are allowed as parallels to the prosody of the cEn cAvdat inscription, lines 4 and 5 may in the end be found to have more in common with other Arabic speech-genres besides al-šťr. The two sentences identified as a single poetic fragment do not, after all, rhyme with each other. Perhaps they are from an oratorical composition akin to hutba, or an incantory couplet from the sag of the pre-Islamic soothsayers.34 In all events the reading I propose for the beginning of line 4 results in a regular pattern of internal assonance for all three Arabic sentences in lines 4 and 5, and zero end-rhyme: Fa-yafalu lā forran wa-lã 3 ãtiran fa-kun h-nJ yabgîna 1-mawtu lã 3 abģāhu fa-kun h-nJ -D-D ģurhun lãy-D-D-nã Formally these lines bear more of a resemblance to sag than to any pat- tern of assonance known in classical Arabic poetry, which is in all periods 32 Wenning, "The Betyls of Petra", 80. 33 In yamsaskum qarhun fa-qad massa 1-qawma qarhun mitluhu .../ "If a wound can befall you (pl.), then a wound like it can surely befall the [disbelieving] folk." Qarh is commonly glossed as ģurh/ ģirāh by the commentators and in Lisān al- carab (art.

There does exist the possibility (indicated by Bellamy and Snir) that the lines represent a rudimentary stage in the evolution of Arabic poetry, "in which no strict and compulsive metrical and rhythmical systems existed."35 The cEn cAvdat inscription can- not however be said to antedate monorhyme in Arabian poetics: in 1973, a 27-line inscription in South Arabian characters dating to the first century CE was discovered at Wädl Qäniya in Yemen, each of its lines ending in -hk.36 This inscription cannot yet be read with confidence, and is no easier to con- nect to the tradition of classical Arabic poetry than is the inscription at cEn cAvdat.37 It does prove that around the time a Nabataean named Garm'alahi inscribed his internally rhyming lines of Arabic on a rock face in the Negev, an end-rhyming style of verse was heard and perhaps composed by the southernmost speakers of that same Arabic language, who were the Himyarites. That said, it can no longer be said that we lack pre-Islamic sources for pre-Islamic poetics, even as the connection between the inscriptive record of the lst/2nd century and the oral record of the 6th/7th century remains surpassingly tenuous and obscure. If my reading of the fourth line is not found altogether infelicitous, it will serve to point out a previously unsuspected closeness between the inscription's idiomatic register and that of seventh-century Higāzī dialect (as documented by later hadit scholars). As such this resemblance is only one of many ways that Nabataean culture in its various stages seems to mirror Mecca on the eve of Islam. We find both societies dominated by an Arabo- phone mercantile aristocracy who enjoyed a fluctuating degree of political autonomy at the margins of world empires and administered a yearly pilgrimage to a black stone at a market town in the high desert where the goddesses Allât and al-cUzzā were venerated. Other pre-Islamic kťab (the seldom-seen plural of Kďbá) besides Mecca's are mentioned in the tradi- tional sources, and plenty of holy stones besides al-hagar al-aswad : what continuity might there be between these sites of Gāhūi worship and those of 35 Snir, "The Inscription of cEn cAbdat", 122. 36 Christian Robin, "Les plus anciens monuments de la langue arabe", 122-5, and "Les inscriptions de l'Arabie antique et les études arabes", 516-22. See also Beeston, "Antecedents of Classical Arabic Verse", 236-8, who favors a later date for the Qäniya inscription. 37 A rendering into modern Arabic by Yüsuf Muhammad cAbd Allah (the inscription's discoverer) appears in his article "Naqš al-qasldat al-himyariyyat aw tarnlmat al- šams", Raydãn, 5 (1988), 81-100; partial English translation by Robert G.
