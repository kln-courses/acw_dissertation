<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXVI, No. 2. JANUARY 17, 1929 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY A BEHAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS. I THE AWARENESS ASPECT OF IT II IT seems generally to be taken for granted that no behaviorist account can be given of consciousness, and most especially of the "qualitative" aspects of consciousness, which are often desig- nated as "conscious qualities." The simon-pure behaviorist, it is supposed, must either deny consciousness altogether or simply ignore it. It is not supposed that a lineal intellectual descendant of Hobbes and Hume, an intellectual liver of the physicist's metaphysical tradi- tion of "matter and motion," can give us either an intelligent, or an intelligible, or a valid account of this most elusive of psychological and metaphysical subject-matters. On the other hand, if there be found to-day any such persons, of these it is probably only an ir- repressible and incorrigible behaviorist that would be so naive as to presume to undertake this age-old task in terms of that tradition. And when we add to his materialistic naivete his reputed "religious" impulsions as a psychological sectarian-defensively imputed to him by other psychological sectarians, perhaps we should be ready to expect of him any foolhardy attempt. At any rate, I am not unaware of the sort of reactions that the mere title of this paper will evoke, most especially as I myself have lived quite the entire gamut of the opposition. Our task, then, is to give a behaviorist definition of consciousness; not a definition of the word, but of the thing or process designated by the word-a very different matter. We are to define the range of facts to which the term designatively and descriptively applies. The nature of the task will be clearer if I first call specific attention to two types of definition. First, there is the verbal definition-of other words. This is a verbal reaction to other words, perhaps parroted from a dictionary or other "authority." And that authority had perhaps poorly isolated and determined the locus and pattern of the stimulus events to which his newly coined or appropriated word was a response. This is one kind of fact that necessitates continually new definitions-of the situation to which the word was a designative and descriptive response. Another kind of fact necessitating new definitions is that new patterns of other than verbal reaction are now and again de- 29</page><page sequence="2">30 JOURANAL OF PHILOSOPHY veloped for that original situation, which makes its verbal designate take on correspondingly different meanings. These two kinds of fact are responsible for growth of our scientific tradition. Scientifically, words have two-way meanings. They mean the antecedent or stimu- lus-patterns for which they substitutionally serve as means of social communication and personal thought. They also mean the patterns of sequential, adaptive behavior which those things elicit and mean. But the popular, verbal tradition outruns the scientific. It is more facile, less specific, and tends to lose all recognizable association with its generative situations, just as do religious practice and ritual. Worse still, this is imputed to tradition as a virtue, as a sign of "progress." It would better be imputed to ignorance, haste, and laziness. One who gets his knowledge by way of verbal definition more or less blindly and unwittingly tries to make his definitions generate the same patterns of behavior, the same experience-save reception of the original stimulus-pattern, as did the original situation for his "authority." But he has no way of testing whether or not he suc- ceeds, and he is not nearly so successful as he might be if he knew that just this was his real task. In fact, he not infrequently is care- less of what the word properly means in terms of reference to the original situation, for which it is a substitute or symbol. It is not unusual, as in ritual and religious symbolism, for men to employ the symbol as an original situation and to engage in seeking what new experiences they may make it evoke or mean. This has been a very characteristic way of treating words. I once had a student who was looking forward to the ministry as a profession, because he had found himself clever in "perceiving new meanings " for words. Per- sons devoted to this kind of behavior often refuse to be interested in the original pattern of situation for which the word or other sym- bol substitutionally stands. For them, "origin does not affect valid- ity." But knowledge of origins may affect emotional congruity in their use of certain words, which congruity is taken as test of the appositeness of reference of these words. This is to treat the word as an original situation, not really as a symbol or substitute stimulus; and thus it is to make it cease from being a real means of intelligible communication. It is a fact that words do mean the reactions that they evoke, as do other patterned objects. But the only way in which they can mean these as means of real communication is by meaning, first of all, respectively common-patterned situations alnd consequently common-patterned reactions for all the communicants. Hence if we are to control the use of the original word in the proper interest of really social communication and understanding we must assure that both the word itself and its verbal definitions shall have a common-patterned situation or point of departure for all. Of</page><page sequence="3">BEHAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS 31 course, this common point of departure can not be identically pat- terned for all, but it can come within the limits of a statistical homology. This means that our real task of definition must be one of better and better isolating, delimiting, and describing the pattern of that original situation to which the original word serves as a socially designative and communicative response. The ever-widening stream of traditional usage of the word, more or less abstracted from con- cern for a better isolating and defining of the pattern of its original and proper designate, may be carrying us farther and farther from its proper meaning. It properly means situations of the pattern of its original designate, and the various adaptive and descriptive reac- tions that we have developed for situations of that kind. It does not mean a string of words and emotional reactions prompted by itself as an original situation. In science we are constantly trying to determine more precisely the pre-verbal situation which the word is employed to designate. Here our scientific definitions are verbal reactions descriptive of various aspects of that same original situation, or of others of its pattern. Our technological definitions are in like manner descrip- tive of the adaptive reactions found appropriate to such situation- patterns. Thus in relation to the processal or temporal flow of ex- perience, words as reaction details with the value of ideas are Janus- faced things, as Dewey has said, with two sets of meanings. First, are antecedent meanings, or situation-patterns meant; second, se- quential meanings, or adaptive reactions meant. Scientifia mean- ings are of the former class; the latter are technological. Both may be preeminently intellectual-preeminently functions of the pro- jicient apparatus, though, of course, sustained by autonomic strains or tensions. But both may also be primarily functions of the au- tonomic apparatus; in which case the chief intellectual work involved is that of perceiving the correct patterns of the words used, and patterns of the situation upon which their use is contingent, so that the appropriate emotional reactions will be evoked. There is an emotional technology as well as a scientific. This we find in the work of the high-powered salesman, the political demagogue, the platform orator, the pulpiteer. Here the technique aimed at is that of the control of men-the undemocratic interpretation of "leader- ship," so commonly insisted upon today as an educational objective for the few. A technology of the control of men is the most un- democratic of things, and there is need that men should have revealed to them its real nature. The consumer as well as the salesman should know the "psychology of salesmanship," for his own protection and for the sake of real democracy. The really democratic leader is the -man who leads the field in his own special type of endeavor, chiefly</page><page sequence="4">32 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY because of his own better technique. His leadership properly con- sists in showing others the way to their improvement in his kind of technique. The loud-mouthed emotionalist and authoritarian is not a leader of men, but of supposed sheep. His leadership is calculated to make men not less but more sheep-like; to make them not less but more dependent upon him and his kind as sources of stimulation and control of their behavior. As M. P. Follett has well said, democratic social control is a control exercised with others, not a control exer- cised- over others. Some may hold that this is to hold our words to too narrow a range of application. The obvious answer is that if such persons feel such limitation, they should either coin or appropriate from other language sources the words necessary to serve as genetic and adaptive designations of the differences that they have discriminated. Lazi- ness or ineptitude is not a sufficient screen for refusal to find the word or phrase necessary or adequate to our purpose. There is here no intention of limiting experience, or of explaining it away. Let it be as rich as may be, with regard to the welfare of the race. But let not the emotional reactions generated by our words as original situations be either mistaken for knowledge or palmed off upon people as such. Thus is indicated the point of departure from which I propose to attempt a definition of that weasly word, consciousness, and its designate. I am aware that such attempt will at first evoke such intended opprobrious reactions as " etymologizing " and "origin does not affect validity." Nevertheless, I am ready for the venture, hav- ing already followed it through to a conclusion that seems to me both significant and valid. It is to be remembered that I am not really undertaking to define this word, but its proper designate and hence the sphere of its appropriate application. II By any definition of this word-or its designate-that I have ever seen, its designate was described as being non-material, non- physical, non-ponderable, inefficacious, and therefore not subject to scientific investigation. On this score that supposed designate could not even be designated, as designation itself is here postulated to be an act of response to a stimulus. But we have the word, which is prima facie evidence that there was something "there"-material, physical, ponderable, efficacious-to which as stimulus this word was seized upon as a significant response. It is this something that we are after. I believe it can be found and made intelligible. If this belief be justified in the outcome, some interesting positive con- clusions may be expected to follow for the metaphysics of the physi- cal sciences; some negative ones, also, for metaphysics in general and</page><page sequence="5">BEHAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS 33 for psychological theory; most especially when I have defined "con- scious quality." The most significant moment in the history or use of a word is the moment of its coining, compounding, appropriation, or selection as a designation for some newly isolated item of experience. In the case of words as old as our historical psychological rubrics, it might at first appear that we could not recover the experience of their origination. But with words borrowed from other languages, and especially with words compounded of either alien or native elements, the case is not so strange as it might seem. If we can but know the meanings of these words and elements at the time of this newly initiated use, we find ticketed upon them, in their mere forms as words, significant tokens of the initiator's experience and intention. It is one thing to search for an appropriate language designation for a newly individuated type or pattern of stimulus. It is a far less specific bit of behavior, given this word as historically established in the language, to try to conclude upon the exact stimulus-pattern that evoked it, unless we take account of such tokens, explicit in the form of the word. Consciousness is a splendid word upon which to try out this hypothesis. " Conscious" is English for the Latin canscius, a word com- pounded of covn- (with, together with) and scius, a derivative from the root of the verb scire (to know). This word conscius is used both as an adjective-its original use-and as a noun. As an adjec- tive it has quite the value of a present participle (knowing with, knowing together with, concomitantly knowing). As such, it refers, of course, to a subject, but most especially to an object-a thing, or things which the subject or agent knows along with his doing some- thing else. To be consciuts of doing wrong is not only to be doing the wrong, but also to be knowing tokens of its wrongness. As a noun the word means an ally, confederate, accomplice; that is, one who is "knowing" or "in the knowing" along with others (one knowing concomitantly with others). But conscius has no impersonal or abstract nominal form. In- stead, the language exhibits the word coascientia, formed directly from the present participle of conscire. Apparently, this form was in the first instance a neuter plural of the participle, in the sense of a plural gerund (knowings along with, concomitant knowings). Thence it became " an attendant, accompanying, or concomitant know- ing. This word became our "conscience." The thing that the old Roman coiner or appropriator of the word in this sense intended to designate was that performance of an act was accompanied by at- tendant knowings of its traditional goodness or badness, and hence that the doer was responsible for consequences. If we had retained this apparently original sense of the word, as "a knowing that ac-</page><page sequence="6">34 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY companies" an act, conscience would not have become reified as an animistic entity, to the great confusion of thought. So it was with this same word in the sense of our word "con- sciousness." The original coiner or compounder or appropriator of the word for this purpose employed it to designate the fact that in his own experience he had isolated and discovered facts of knowing con- comitant with or supervening upon his primary or major acts. He thus signified, first, not only that an agent acted-adaptively, let us say-but that he knew that he was acting. In other words, at the same time with a central or primordial act he found himself cog- nizant of one or other detail of this act. Or again, he was "con- scious" of his act. Second, he meant to signify not only that he was acting within a given situation, but also that he was cognizant of other details of the situation than the one to which he was directly responding. That is, the concomitant knowings constituting con- sciousness may be either of the reaction being made or of details of the situation within which the reaction is performed. This, of course, is a more sophisticated report of his experience than that originator of the word could have made, but I believe it is essentially correct. Here, again, if we had retained the original sense of our word " consciousness, " as this is still signified by its form, we should not have hypostatized the process itself as being a more or less anthropomorphic, animistic entity. III It may now be asked just what is meant here by "knowing, " both in the primary sense of direct adaptation and in that of the inci- dental details of cognizance that constitute consciousness. We may distinguish two elemrentary and correlative kinds of "knowing": "knowing how" to react to presented stimulus-patterns and "know- ing that" a given stimulus-pattern is present. Genetically, we act first and then learn to discriminate our stimulus-patterns, which discrimination in turn requires more highly discriminative end-re- sponses or adaptations. Stimulus-patterns are just what they are, and our actual receptors are mechanically tuned to their respective kinds, or frequency ranges. But accessory apparatus serves to bring these receptors to bear more directly upon their stimuli, as in focus- ing the eyes, adjusting the ears by turning the head, and moving the hands in search of tactual and temperature stimuli. Genetically, the primary level of knowing consists in direct, unmediated reac- tions: first, of the somatic, projicient, adaptive structures; second, of the accessory apparatus, in individuating the spatial character- istics, especially, of stimulus sources. As being direct, mechanical, or automatic reactions, these are not properly classed as "knowing"</page><page sequence="7">BEHAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS 35 reactions, but they constitute the elementary level of a genetic series in whose higher levels real knowing is exhibited. Traditionally, because of the authoritarian organization of the home and other social institutions, a strong emphasis has been placed upon the known and customary patterns of adaptive behavior, and hence upon a maintenance of the kinds of situation evoking them. Hence the historical interest in morals and ethics, primarily an inter- est in established ways of behaving as such, and betraying a fear of consequences of non-customary behavior. The interest in the customary and this fear of the unfamiliar led to the development of the most powerful possible of sanctions for the established ways. Hence the formation of creeds and constitutions, and the cultivated reverence for their more or less mythical or mythicized founders. All this is genetically related to the childish interest in the "Why" or "What's that for," and to the cultivated childish fear as a means of social control. It is a socially retained childish interest; in other words, it is an exhibition of both infantilism and primitivism. It reflects a racial level and a personal status when the individual is not able to develop objectives of his own and thence to inquire about the "How" or technique of achieving them. He can ask only about the antecedents of action, in order to effect an adaptation to these. He can face the future only by looking backwards. It is only when the race and the individual can face the future under guidance of objectives to be won that they can "Abjure the Why and seek the How. "I Traditionally, also, because of the particularist, socially ab- stracted, leisure-class situations out of which our later developed intellectual tradition emerged, an emphasis has been placed upon knowledge of stimulus-patterns as such. We became interested in the "what," and endeavored to translate it into a known "that." Thus originated our intellectualistic, verbalistic metaphysics. The interest here has been chiefly an interest in sensory and imaginal "content," an interest in the action of the receptors, especially visual, and largely a mistakiing of imagery for ideas. Hence the Platonic metaphysic of "ideas," and the Aristotelian metaphysie of "form," suggested in the first instance by Socrates, who had been a sculptor and wont to guide his artistic behavior by a focusing of his eyes for seeing the form to be executed. This historically pro- longed leisure-class metaphysical interest has drawn a red herring across the trail of intellectual endeavor, so that even our physicists and physiologists still talk in some measure the old metaphysical lingo, especially regarding " sensation " and " consciousness, " in the traditional sense of these terms, as designating "qualitative" factors of experience. First, then, and genetically, knowing consists in explicitly react-</page><page sequence="8">36 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ing to stimuli. In this sense of the word, a baby at birth already "knows how" to grasp, even though it does not know how to indi- viduate its stimulus-patterns, so as to control or adapt its grasping. Ability to do what it does consists in the fact of having reaction- structures already organized, through which the reactions are effected. In such cases a given set of effector structures may be nervously linked up with various sets of receptor structures, through conditioning, so that a reaction of a given pattern may be evoked by stimulation of a number of different receptors, and even by differently patterned stimuli of each. That is, a given efferent are may have engrafted upon it a number of afferent arcs, involving different receptor organs, and even different patterns of anatomical units of each. In a similar way a number of efferent arcs may be connected with a given afferent arc, so that a given stimulus-pattern may evoke reactions of a number of patterns. But the child does not yet know that it has been stimulated, nor that it has reacted. To do this it must be able to designate these two sets of facts; which means to make reactions substitutional for the primary reactions that each kind of stimulus would evoke, and socially communicative regarding them-a matter of conditioning. The higher levels of reactions of such a genetic series as we are here considering are reactions of the same effector structures, respectively, as those involved in the basic level: first, in explicit response to substitutes for their original stimulus-patterns; second, in implicit response to either original or substitute stimuli. We may now note the second level. As the child automatically, reflexly learns to focus or adjust his receptors for the more highly discriminated stimulus-patterns to which correlative adaptations may be made, he becomes able to designate these patterns; and when he individuates such patterns, but has not yet learned the socially acceptable designation, he demands to know this; he asks, "What's that? " Explicitly employing discriminative designations constitutes the second level of "knowing that." It is out of this infantile inter- est, as I have said, that our traditional metaphysics has developed. The metaphysician has not been content merely to know that he has been stimulated by a particular pattern; he wants to know what the "that" is in the peculiar interpretation that he has made of it. Hence the historical problems of " consciousness " and its " qualities," problems that must be solved before philosophy can discern its true job, freed from these historically false problems. "Knowing how," also, is exhibited on a second level. Here it consists in designating the reaction-patterns respectively learned as being appropriate to discriminated stimulus-patterns. Ability to discriminate reaction patterns is first of all an ability to trace them objectively like physical objects, against the background of the ob-</page><page sequence="9">BEHAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS 37 jective situation. Second, it is ability to refer them to patterns of subjective stress and strain in relation to the now learned spatial patterns of the body in its various postures. This ability is improved through a correlative demand upon society; the subject now asks, "What's that for?" His query is directed towards knowing the adaptive reactions socially accepted as appropriate to his newly discriminated stimulus-patterns. Out of this interest is developed our interest in techniques as such, especially those of custom, tradi- tion, institutionalism-still a childish interest. On the one side is the authoritarian, still fearful of the consequences of unfamiliar modes of behavior upon his stock-in-trade, endeavoring to maintain the kinds of situation upon which customary behavior is conditioned, and hence trying to make himself necessary as a means of informa- tion regarding the approved modes of behavior in relation to these situations. The young, subjected to this kind of treatment, are trained to acquiesce in this infantile dependency and thus to per- petuate the need of authoritarianism-a vicious cycle of infantilism. Thus far the child's "knowing" behavior is explicit. But con- comitantly with improvement in this has gone on an increasing abil- ity to inhibit overt action and to perform both designative and adaptive behavior implicitly. This introvertive but tremendously economical step is a result of social pressure, in its vicious aspects genetically imposed by taboos. This plane of implicit behavior is the plane of thought proper, consisting in implicit rehearsal of ex- plicit behavior, and now taking precedence over explicit behavior and guiding it. It is still further economical in that not only may the major act of the moment be performed implicitly, so as to determine its implications for explicit enactment, but reception of other stimuli may go on, and even more highly implicit or attenuated reactions be made to them. It is these concomitant implicit reactions, of dis- criminating more or less relevant stimuli during the progress of the major act, that constitute consciousness. The central act of the moment, whether explicit or implicit, is not itself a content of consciousness. We may be conscious of, or regard- ing, it; it is not itself a detail but a condition of consciousness. The details of consciousness are details of knowing that stimuli of such and such patterns are playing upon us, or within us, and this know- ing consists in designating implicitly-and hence to or within our- selves-that these stimulus-patterns are present. It may be asked just specifically what can be meant by indicating "to or within ourselves." For answer to this question I propose, first, that every reaction-structure is "objective" to every other and that, in general, reaction of any one-especially of the projicient apparatus-may serve as stimulus to any other. It seems to be</page><page sequence="10">38 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY upon such a basis as this that introspection is possible; in fact, this seems to suggest the real nature of introspection. This means that introspection, rightly carried on as a means of psychological analysis, is an effort to individuate bodily internal stimulus-patterns, ob- jective to the designative apparatus. Second, I suggest that the chief reactions constituting consciousness are those of the language or speech apparatus, as these implicitly report or designate the stimulus-patterns that are being discriminated. The discriminations that will be made are not primarily determined by the stimuli them- selves, nor by the receptors, but by the segment of effector apparatus that is tonically ascendant, demanding the stimulus that will neu- tralize its tonus; in other words, by the "mental set" of the moment. Third, I suggest that there must be such a nervous connection be- tween the speech apparatus and the ear that we implicitly or imagin- atively hear ourselves speak, whence this hearing itself can serve as stimulus to further reactions. This implies that there must be centrif- ugal or efferent axons leading out to the auditory apparatus, and in synaptic connection there with afferent neurons, as well as afferent or centripetal ones leading from the ear to the brain. I have as yet seen no anatomical evidence of such an arrangement, nor has there been any motive for our anatomists' looking for such. But there does seem to be such an arrangement in the eye, as the diagrammatic drawing in Ranson's Anatomy of the Nervous System, Figure 160, intentionally shows.' It is possibly difference in numbers and development of these efferent fibers that is responsible for individual differences in ability I The existence of efferent fibers in the optic nerve has been anatomically demonstrated for all vertebrates (Leslie B. Arey, "The Functions of the Effer- ent Fibers of the Optic Nerve in Fishes," Journal of Comparative Neurology, XXVI, 213-245; J. B. Johnston, The Nervous System of Vertebrates, Phila., 1906, p. 265). Moreover, light produces actual movements of pigment cells and of rods and cones in the retina, (Arey, "Movements in the Visual Cells and Retinal Pigment of the Lower Vertebrates," ibid., 121-201). In the cases of fishes and birds, the rods lengthen and the cones shorten in response to light, the cones showing the greater response (ibid., 183-187). But not only does light have this effect. Apparently faradic stimulation of these efferent elements produces some sort of similar retinal response. Arey tends to discount such a notion (p. 236), but the data supporting both sides of the dispute were secured from excised eyes, upon which no "demand," either autonomic or projicient, could be made, so that such a stimulus could be relied upon to complete a circuit and so facilitate the setting up of a current. Had he seen his problem from a different angle, he might have found data which he failed to find with the one he had. If currents initiated in different receptors could induce movements of the rods and cones homologous with those produced by light of different mixtures and ranges, so that differential action of the speech mechanisms, acting in substitution for the sources of this light, could also produce retinal responses homologous with those of light combinations, we should have a complete mechanism for colored imagery.</page><page sequence="11">BEHAAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS 39 to experience colored imagery; and possibly a similar situation pre- vails in the auditory apparatus. I certainly seem to hear myself speak subvocally; it is my own voice, and no other, that I seem to hear. This meansto me-not only that my auditory apparatus may be stimulated by even implicit reactions of my speech apparatus, but that auricular reception of such stimulations may in turn stimulate my speech apparatus to report the fact, as well as evoke other adaptive reactions. It may be that I can not distinguish what these other reactions are, or even that they occur, which merely means that they do not evoke further items of response-chiefly vocal-as consciousness. For them to do so would only interfere with the business of the moment. Some one may raise the objection that this would result in an infinite regression. But temporally, pro- cessally, such a regression is really a progression, and there are always events occurring to prevent its carrying out to an infinity. Apparently our chief studies of the efferent fibers of the optic " nerve" have been made upon sections from lower animals. On account of the different part that both vocal and sub-vocal behavior plays in human life, we should hardly expect to be satisfied, in the case of hearing, with data secured from study of the acoustic ap- paratus of lower animals. Perhaps in the first instance the function of the neurones was that of bringing about adjustments of the retinal elements apposite to organismic demands that were satisfied through vision, so that stimulation was facilitated. From that there may have been a progression to the point where such organismic conditions, autonomic or projicient, could bring about retinal conditions actually but faintly substitutional for those that would prevail in the case of light stimuli themselves. This would be a phylogenetic account of the way in which colored imagery has become possible. IV It will be seen from the foregoing that I can find no place for a conception of consciousness as consisting of sensations, sensa, qualia, data, or essences occurring at synapses of the cortex. By current definitions of these rubrics, their designates could not serve as stimuli to evoke even designating responses. The descriptive or defining re- sponses that are thus made are responses to stimuli; they are not spontaneous, that is certain. But these stimuli certainly do not occur in the brain, but in receptors. The only reason for assigning sensations to the cortex is that we had on our hands both these qualia and the cortex, as things to be explained. We did not know what to make of either and hence associated them in this way. We have been like the man with the dog that was good for nothing else</page><page sequence="12">40 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and that therefore must be good for hunting coon. But there is another way of disposing of these qualia, as we shall see later. Consciousness, then, is constituted of acts, not of sensations or qualities. Its constituent acts are acts implicit, and substitutional for acts of direct adaptation; they are preeminently acts of desig- nating stimulus-patterns received, to which adaptive reaction might have been made, and which may become the source and ocmasion of either implicit or explicit adaptation. In other words, these super- vening knowings that constitute consciousness are knowings that such and such stimulus-patterns are occurring, among which the agent may pick and select in the guidance of that space-time course of existence or behavior which he is. Consciousness thus has efficacy. In ultimate analysis it is as physical as any other kind of act or existence. Instead of being a persistent existential entity, it consists in a kind of events or reac- tions occurring in the course of a process-the more pervasive or- ganismic process of maintaining or effecting an adaptation. Thus the word "consciousness," instead of designating an ex- istential entity, is the generalizing, combination response by which we designate the items of behavior by which an organism presents itself with incidental data regarding present reaction and current environment. The data of consciousness, the cues to behavior given in or by consciousness, are stimulus-patterns for which the organism possesses already organized structures of adaptation, and to which it may turn from those upon which it is at any moment engaged. These stimulus-patterns are mutually different, either spatially or tempo- rally, or even both at once. It is by virtue of these differences that they may be differentiated and hence picked and selected among. Consciousness is thus at once an exhibition of intelligence and a con- dition of a more highly intelligent behavior. It raises intelligence to a higher power. Consciousness, like intelligence, grows with increas- ing range of experience. We may recognize such a thing as consciousness of consciousness. This consists in an occasional succession of knowings supervening upon selected details of the consciousness attending the primary busi- ness of the moment. But when this happens, that primary occupa- tion has lapsed from attention, and details of the consciousness at- tending it have usurped its place. This is how acts of introspection begin. But introspection is not an analysis of consciousness as such. It is a matter of seeking the differential reaction appropriate to implicit reactions as stimuli-now as the, central object of attention, and of seeking to discriminate such inner stimulus-patterns, in order to insure appropriateness and communicativeness of the designations to be made. The too crass behaviorist, in his condemnation of intro-</page><page sequence="13">BEHAVIORIST ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS 41 spection, has blindly condemned or denied the process by which he himself is able to comprehend the motives of others, and many sources of self-knowledge as well. On the other hand, the introspectionist himself has had none too clear an idea of what he was about and of how he was able to carry on. The much condemned "arm-chair psy- chology" has not yet made its full contribution to our knowledge of mental life; and objective, laboratory experimentation must forever depend upon arm-chair effort really to interpret its findings. Mental life does not consist in graphs and mathematical correlations. These are at best but statistical organizations of data as concentrated points of procedure for that implicit, arm-chair rehearsal by which in- terpretations are patiently worked out. Our conclusion regarding the nature of consciousness may be ob- jected to, on the ground of the etymological control employed in reaching it. It may be objected that we to-day know far more about consciousness than did that old-time originator of its verbal designa- tion. I trust I have already shown this to be the case. But what specific facts will any one add that the term, as he apparently em- ployed it, fails to cover? I have been acting upon the principle that before we can make dependable interpretations of a fact we must be able to bound that fact on all sides and must keep the discerned boundaries specifically in mind while making the interpretations. Perhaps I myself have failed at point after point in holding to the principle; but the method intended to be employed I believe will hold good wherever a corresponding cue to control can be found. It is a fact that any word, any pattern of vocal sound, can be made to designate any kind of fact. But this kind of fact must first be individuated, before the designation can be employed as a reliable means of social communication. And this must be held to its rela- tionship to its own kind of designate, not be ignorantly, lazily, or sur- reptitiously employed for some other. The function of language is not that of mere self-expression; it is that of social communication and mutual understanding. The first duty of the user of language is to make himself understood. This means that our designates must be most specifically delineated and indicated in all possible details. Only so will their socially common designations have statistically homologous meanings for us all, howsoever different interpretative meanings we may devise for them. V A final word on some popular metaphysics of the case and I am done. First, there is a rather common notion that we can render into knowledge terms the ultimate character or actual stuff of the physical world. Thus the man in the street often supposes that some</page><page sequence="14">42 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY super-microscope or other super-aid to our receptors may reveal to us the actual stuff of our physical world. A more sophisticated case is the Berkeleyan notion that physical objects are clusters of sensa- tions or qualities, and that these constitute the content of knowledge. On the contrary, however, all that our receptors ever reveal to us is similarities and differences of statistically classifiable events as differently patterned stimuli integrate with our receptor structures. Our knowledge of these consists in respectively different patterns of reactions to them. But a reaction is never a literal rendering or reproduction of its stimulus, or of the pattern of stimulus-receptor events. Our knowledge or explanation of red is not itself red. The knowledge of things can never give us those things as they are "in themselves." The function of knowledge is to furnish us with the patterns of behavior of our own nature and of the world about us, to the end that we may achieve a continuation of that kind of existence that we are-human-kind, which must continuously result in making us different from what we are, if our kind is to continue to exist. I have spoken of two types of current knowledge-interest as "infantile" or "childish." A really adult knowledge-interest is one having regard for consequences, as it regularly is in practical life, even in that of the authoritarian seeking to maintain his authority and prestige. It is a forward-, not a backward-looking interest. In its most practical sense of all it consists in a regard for consequences in their bearing upon the prospect of a continuance of our kind. It consists in regarding the racial life as a space-time reality whose nature is to go on, and in considering how we may so live and behave as to assure its continuance. It is here that the "practical" of pragmatism must find its meaning. Evolutionary science has thus far given us a gross view of an illimitable past experience of con- tinuous change. Evolutionary social engineering will proceed by trying to make the racial future equally illimitable. And philosophy will sit critically in judgment upon the interpretations and uses made of scientific findings, and upon the measures taken with reference to this racial end. Second, there is prevalent at present altogether too naive a view of the graphs, correlations, and mathematical formulhe by which scientific data are organized. Neither are these a literal rendering of the reality which they represent. They are descriptive designations of what science is finding out about human and extra-human be- havior. In so far as they are descriptively correct, they are but cues for interpretations to be made and hence for adaptations to be effected. We may not all agree in the interpretations. Therein lies the hope of mutual rational growth and of democracy. When our</page><page sequence="15">THE END OF A GREAT LEGEND 43 scientists themselves have really mastered their own findings, they will find themselves able to state these in terms intelligible to the common man. Their own principles of "simplicity" and "parsi- mony," if justified in the nature of things, promise this in plainest terms. When we have cleared away the mythical and metaphysical rubbish that our long period of infancy and childhood has accumu- lated, we shall have more faith to believe this, and a more adult courage to live that faith.2 ORLAND 0.
