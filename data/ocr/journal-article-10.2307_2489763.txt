<plain_text><page sequence="1">Consumers and Their Animal Companions ELIZABETH C. HIRSCHMAN* Despite the widespread practice of keeping companion animals, virtually no consumer behavior studies have been conducted on this phenomenon. The present inquiry uses detailed depth interviews with consumers to expand three a priori themes- animals as friends, animals as self, and animals as family members-and to discuss two emergent themes: (1) companion animals' mediation between nature and culture, and (2) the socialization of consumers' companion animal preference patterns. Building on this knowledge, several directions for future research on companion animals are discussed. In 1978, at a late Paleolithic site in North- ern Israel, a tomb was uncovered in which the remains of a human and a dog had been buried together roughly 12,000 years ago. Whoever presided over the original bur- ial . . . arranged the dead person's hand on the animal's shoulder, as if to emphasize the bonds that existed between [them] dur- ing life. [WORKING PARTY COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND SOCIETY 1988, P. 8] A s the above passage indicates, the relationship be- tween humans and other animal species has been an enduring one. American consumers currently main- tain an estimated 63 million cats, 55 million dogs (Market Research Corp. of America 1991), 25 million birds, 250 million fish, and 125 million other assorted creatures as pets (Katcher 1986). Within the European Economic Community there are an estimated 26 mil- lion dogs and 23 million cats, together with an addi- tional 42 million other animals ranging from reptiles and fish to rodents and birds kept as pets (Serpell 1986). Given the remarkable size and diversity of these house- hold menageries, lit is surprising that so little attention has been devoted to the phenomenon of pet ownership by social science in general (Beck and Katcher 1983; Katcher 1981; Serpell 1986) and consumer researchers in particular (see, for an exception, Sanders [19911 ). This omission is all the more salient because arche- ological evidence suggests that in several respects human organization into village communities was assisted by the domestication of several animal species. According to fossil remains, the wolf was the first species to be domesticated, an event that occurred in prehistoric set- tlements in the Near East some 12,000 years ago (Serpell 1986). Shortly thereafter, sheep and goats were trans- formed to domestic status. Approximately 9,000 years ago, cattle and pigs were being raised in human settle- ments in parts of Asia (Serpell 1986). They were soon followed by horses, donkeys, camels, and water buffalo. And around 3,000-4,000 years ago, the cat became a household animal, and god, in Egypt (Savishinsky 1986; Serpell 1986). It is significant to note that the keeping of animals as pets did not merely come as a result of the domes- tication of animals for utilitarian purposes, such as food and protection, but appears to have resulted from a hu- man desire for companionship with other species (see Messent and Serpell 1981). From the earliest days of European exploration, native peoples were found to be engaged in pet keeping. For example, from the early 1500s onward, explorers and missionaries described native inhabitants of the Americas as keeping a wide variety of companion animals: raccoons, monkeys, peccaries, tapirs, wolves, bears, moose, mice, rats, squirrels, and birds (Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). Analogously, present-day hunting and gathering so- cieties, which keep few or no domestic animals for util- itarian purposes, are commonly found to keep a wide variety of companion animals. For example, Australian Aborigines keep tame wallabies, possums, dingoes, bandicoots, and cassowaries; the Inuit of the Arctic re- gions maintain pet bear cubs, foxes, porcupines, birds, wolves, and baby seals; and South American natives keep agoutis, pacas, parrots, rodents, sloths, and mon- keys (Savishinsky 1986). In some cases young mammals are suckled by the women of the tribe, cared for like children and, upon their death, are buried near the '-Elizabeth C.

Thus, the lives of humans and other animal species are, and have been, closely intertwined in ways that surpass utilitarian necessity and approximate interpersonal bonding. ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND NEOTENY As I shall describe shortly, companion animals may play many roles in the lives of consumers. They are assisted in this by two related, yet distinct, phenomena, both of which originate with the human species: an- thropomorphism and neoteny. Anthropomorphism re- fers to the apparently universal human tendency to as- cribe human characteristics to nonhuman entities (Messent and Serpell 1981, p. 11; Serpell 1986, p. 138). Although anthropomorphic qualities are occasionally projected onto inanimate objects,2 most commonly they are associated with other, living creatures. In particular, companion animals are imbued by their owners with human qualities.3 Companion animals, especially dogs, are often assisted in their anthropomorphic roles by a physical characteristic termed neoteny. Neoteny refers to the tendency of an animal species to maintain a ju- venile appearance into adulthood (Beck and Katcher 1983). This has the effect on humans of making the animal appear especially endearing and in need of nur- turance and care, much as the appearance of human infants does (Serpell 1986). Among the neotenous traits given to dogs through the past 12,000 years of selective breeding are foreshortened snouts, curling tails, large brown eyes, hanging ears, short hair, skin folds, and miniature size (Tuan 1984). Similarly, the most popular breed of domestic cat, the Persian, has been selectively bred to have large, round eyes, a small short muzzle, small ears, and a round face-all of which combine to give it a doll- or childlike face (Katcher and Beck 1986). However, even in their natural state, dogs (wolves) exhibited features that made them attractive as com- panions for humans and encouraged anthropomorphic projection. Wolves and humans exhibit similar facial expressions and use their facial muscles in a similar manner to express various emotions (Messent and Ser- pell 1981). For example, both wolves and humans show elaborate greeting responses when meeting "pack" members, both species lower their heads and shoulders and avert their eyes to exhibit submission, and both participate in elaborate ritualized play activities, com- plete with feigned "chase and attack" sequences and "wrestling," that is, dominance/submission challenges (Serpell 1986). THE ROLES OF COMPANION ANIMALS Companion animals play many roles in consumers' lives. At the risk of oversimplification, however, these roles may be divided into two broad categories: animals as objects/products and animals as companions. The primary objective of this article is to discuss companion animals in their interactive roles with people. However, it is important to describe first their use as objects/ products so that a more distinct understanding can be gained of their roles as companions. Animals as Objects/Products In their roles as objects/products, animals are reduced from their status as consumers' companions and be- come instead objects in the consumers' environment. Several ways in which this may occur are described below. Animals as Ornaments. In this role, animals are kept to provide aesthetic value or pleasure to consumers. Exotic birds with beautiful plumage or melodic voices often serve this purpose, as do aquariums filled with tropical fish and outdoor pools stocked with koi. In this role, animals perform much the same function as houseplants, paintings, and sculpture-beautiful-to- behold possessions (Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). Animals as Status Symbols. Some consumers ac- quire animals as a means of achieving or displaying elite status (Beck and Katcher 1983; Savishinsky 1986; Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). For example, rare, unusual, or expensive animals may be purchased to serve the consumer much as the ac- quisition of a Mercedes Benz, Rolex watch, or Hermes scarf would-as a visible sign of wealth and high social rank. Breeds that currently often serve as status objects include King Charles spaniels, Chinese shar-pei dogs, Sphynx and Bengal cats, and Arabian or Thoroughbred horses. Related to this is the purchase of champion pedigreed animals by consumers who are, on a deeper level, at- tempting to acquire a distinguished lineage for them- selves (Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). The animal is not appreciated in and of itself but, rather, for the pedigree it embodies. Animals as Avocation. Into this grouping fall con- sumers whose primary purpose in owning animals is to breed them for showing/exhibiting (Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). Cat and dog shows are highly competitive events in which individual animals (representing, of course, their owner's egos) are compared against each other, as well as an ideal breed standard, and evaluated accordingly (Tuan 1984). Breeding and showing animals also demonstrates consumers' tendencies to selectively manipulate the 2See Levy (1985) for a discussion of this phenomenon with regard to automobiles. 3This tendency is reinforced and reiterated in popular culture ve- hicles such as television shows, e.g., Lassie, and motion pictures, e.g., Turner and Hooch, Benji, Beethoven.</page><page sequence="3">618 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH gene pools of the animals being bred (Tuan 1984). For example, from the basic wolflike canine domesticated 12,000 years ago have now been created 136 dog breeds. Analogously, from the original cat domesticated 4,000 years ago have now sprung 44 distinct breeds (Gebhardt 1991). In some cases, breeders have created-and con- sumers have demanded-genetic extremes that are dis- advantageous (or even fatal) to the animals. For ex- ample, dachshunds and basset hounds have such long backs and short legs that they frequently suffer from back injuries (Serpell 1986). Persian cats have become so extreme in their foreshortened muzzles over the past two decades that many now have congenital jaw and nasal malformations (Gebhardt 1991). The "new look" in head shape for the Burmese cat is actually a result of a congenital skull malformation that causes an ex- tremely rounded forehead and protuberant eyes (Geb- hardt 1991). Other practices, such as tail docking and ear trimming, are viewed by some observers as cruel in that they are surgical procedures required only for the purpose of making the animal's physical appearance conform to an artificial standard (Serpell 1986; Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). Animals as Equipment. North American Plains In- dians used both dogs and horses as equipment for hunt- ing and transportation; the Arctic Inuit similarly use dogs for transportation even today. Animals also serve modern North American consumers as equipment for several utilitarian and recreational activities (Fogle 1981). For example, dogs are used for hunting a variety of other animals, to protect consumers' homes and property, and as guides/companions for the deaf and blind. Animals may be used to instruct young children in "petting zoos" and as therapy for elderly and infirm consumers in hospitals and nursing homes (Cass 1981; Corson and Corson 1981; Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). In this role, animals serve to facilitate the performance of other activities. Animals as People. Although animals do serve consumers in utilitarian, aesthetic, or facilitative roles, many, perhaps the majority, act as companions to their human owners. But the types of companionship sought by consumers, and provided by animals, vary greatly. Animals may act as friends and partners to their owners, providing faithful, intimate companionship that is un- conditional and nonjudgmental (Beck and Katcher 1983; Feldmann 1979; Working Party Council for Sci- ence and Society 1988). Animals may serve as children, preparing prospective parents for the responsibilities of raising human children (Beck and Katcher 1983; Serpell 1986). They may also serve as child substitutes for childless couples or for parents whose human children have left home (Feldmann 1979; Robins, Sanders, and Cahill 1991; Sanders 1990; Savishinsky 1986; Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). Finally, animals may act as extensions of the con- sumer's self (see Belk 1988, pp. 155-156). In this role, the animal's traits, behaviors, and appearance are seen as being those of its owner; the owner projects his or her own personality onto the animal and absorbs the animal's nature into himself or herself (Beck and Katcher 1983; Feldmann 1979; Savishinsky 1986). A related role is to see the animal as representing the id of the owner. Unlike adult humans who must become socialized to control their carnal impulses, animals are permitted more leeway in their behavior. Consumers may take secret delight in their pet's capacity to express greed, lust, gluttony, anger, jealousy, dependence, dominance and sexuality, which they, themselves, are forbidden (Beck and Katcher 1983). A PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH Since the present purpose is to comprehend consum- ers' relationships with their companion animals, a phe- nomenological approach to data gathering was appro- priate. Much prior research underlying theories of companion animals has been based on survey data de- rived from samples of pet owners (e.g., Katcher and Beck 1986). Recently, however, interpretive inquiries based on ethnographic and/or autoethnographic meth- ods have provided some constructive insights (see Rob- ins et al. 1991; Sanders 1990, 1991), particularly into the role animals play as consumers' surrogate children. Because consumers may react defensively to re- searcher questions that suggest their animals are, in fact, performing human roles in their lives, the nondirective, nonjudgmental approach of phenomenological inter- views (see Bergadaa 1990; McCracken 1988; O'Guinn and Faber 1989; Schouten 1991; Thompson, Locander, and Pollio 1989, 1990) was chosen. A purposive sample of 25 pet owner-informants was selected that included 11 men and 14 women ranging in age from 18 to 68 and spanning occupational groups from working-class retirees to college students to corporate executives. In- formants were approached by a member of a team of three experienced interviewers (two female, one male) who had extensive academic exposure to prior phe- nomenological studies conducted in consumer research. In approaching potential informants, interviewers would inform them that an academic study on com- panion animals was being conducted and ask permis- sion to interview (and tape record) them. Informants were offered anonymity, but none requested it. Most were pleased, even enthusiastic, to have the opportunity to talk about their animal companions. All interviews were conducted in the informant's present residence, usually with the pet nearby. Interviews were 45 minutes to two hours in duration and were usually initiated by asking the informant to simply "begin at the beginning." Most chose to start in their own early-to-mid-childhood and "work their way up" through a chronology of pets to the present day. In a few instances, the informants would restrict them- selves to a discussion of their current pets. Although</page><page sequence="4">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 619 not explicitly planned in advance, the range of pets dis- cussed was quite diverse-stretching from domestic and purebred cats and dogs to ferrets, rabbits, and gerbils onward to snakes, ducks, hermit crabs, tropical fish, turtles, and iguanas. Throughout the interviews, the researchers provided support and encouragement and occasionally probed for the meaning of unfamiliar phrases. As Jorgensen ( 1989), McCracken ( 1988), and Thompson et al. ( 1989, 1990) advise, the informant was allowed-and encour- aged-to tell his or her story in his or her own words with minimal direction from the researcher. Eight of the interviews were conducted by the primary researcher, and eight were conducted by each of the two research assistants, for a total of 24 interviews.4 Both the primary researcher and the research assistants in- terviewed male and female consumers. All of the in- formants were personally known by their interviewers, which greatly facilitated the flow of conversation in a natural and emotionally supportive atmosphere. As the interviews were conducted and transcribed, both the primary researcher and the two research as- sistants would make initial marginal notations regarding substantive content areas that had been discussed (e.g., "death of pet"). These would be discussed among the three researchers and aggregated into meaning catego- ries (e.g., pet acquisition). To provide variation in ex- perience, additional informants were sought based on their divergence in age, socioeconomic status, or life- style from those consumers already interviewed.' How- ever, as will be seen, the content areas discerned were represented across the sample of animal owners talked to; thus, the emergent themes identified appear to be common elements of the companion animal experience and not limited to a particular "type" of consumer (see, e.g., Hirschman 1992; Thompson et al. 1990). The two research assistants were responsible for con- ducting and providing initial interpretive analysis of their interviews. The primary researcher, using a her- meneutical interpretive process (see Hirschman 1992; Hirschman and Holbrook 1992; McCracken 1988; Thompson et al. 1990), iterated between the content categories identified within the research team and the entire set of interview transcripts. Categories of meaning were refined or expanded based on this hermeneutic process and continued discussion with the other mem- bers of the research team.6 The result was an initial interpretation that was provided to the two assistant researchers for their critique, as well as to six informants who appeared especially insightful to the researchers. Their comments have been incorporated in the present report. In addition, the entire manuscript was given to two small-animal veterinarians in private practice for their critique. Their comments have also been included in the present article. From our collective analyses, three a priori themes, derived from the existing literature, were supported in whole or in part. These were animals as friend, animals as self, and animals as family member. Additionally, two emergent themes (e.g., those found in Hill and Sta- mey 1990; Schouten 1991) were also discerned. These were labeled as (1) mediation between nature and cul- ture, and (2) the socialization of consumers' companion animal preference patterns. I turn first to a discussion of the a priori themes and subsequently to a consider- ation of the emergent themes. A Priori Themes Flowing from the use of this term by other consumer researchers (see Hill and Stamey 1990; Hirschman 1992; Schouten 1991), a priori themes were those that were anticipated to be present in the interview texts based either on the extant literature (e.g., Schouten 1991) or on personal experience and insider knowledge (e.g., Hirschman 1992). In addition to investigating exten- sively the literature base on companion animals, the principal researcher is also a long-term companion an- imal keeper.7 Animals as Friends Perhaps most commonly, animals serve consumers as friends; that is, the animal is "perceived and treated as a subject, as a personality in its own right" (Working 4Although a total of 25 consumers were interviewed, two of them were interviewed jointly as a couple (Fred and John). 5A reviewer raised the issue of "natives interviewing natives" or "insiders interviewing insiders" with regard to the fact that the present researchers were both North Americans and pet owners, just as were those interviewed. While this issue is philosophically significant, it does not appear to be any more relevant to the outcome of the present inquiry than to virtually all the other interpretive and ethnographic inquiries thus far published in the Journal of Consumer Research, which, with the exception of Arnould (1989), have relied on North Americans to study and interpret the behaviors of other North Amer- icans. If, say, non-pet-owning Asians had been brought over to con- duct interviews with North American pet owners, it is very possible that a quite different interpretation may have resulted (e.g., "why do you Americansfeed dogs dinner instead of eating dogs for dinner?"), but that interpretation would not necessarily be superior to the present one. Further, if non-natives and noninsiders are used to conduct in- terviews with insiders/natives, the opposite criticism can be made, i.e., that those who are outside the culture and do not participate in the actual experience under study simply cannot understand or com- prehend it as fully as insiders/natives can. For a more detailed dis- cussion of these issues see Joy (1991). 6A cross-indexing procedure was developed that used three levels of abstraction. Overarching themes, e.g., animals as friend, constituted the highest level of abstraction. An intermediate categorization level was used to identify various types of friendship, say, between animals and children, and a third categorization level was used to label specific examples of animals as friends within the actual transcripts. 7The principal researcher's companion animal history includes mixed-breed and purebred dogs and cats, turtles, tadpoles, frogs, sal- amanders, parakeets, hamsters, lizards, tropical fish, goldfish, and rabbits. At the present time, two cats (Starlight and Buttons) and one dog (Victoria) reside at the researcher's home. The two assistant re- searchers also have extensive histories of animal companions.</page><page sequence="5">620 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Party Council for Science and Society 1988). As friends, animals may be especially valuable and comforting be- cause they provide unconditional love and loyalty. As Feldmann (1979, p. 16) observes: "A pet is a faithful, intimate, noncompetitive, and nonjudgmental friend." Animal friends often may serve their owners better than human friends, who are sometimes subject to envy, jealousy, elitism, and materialism. Several of those in- terviewed spoke of their animals as friends, most com- monly with reference to dogs. In particular, dogs, and occasionally cats, would be permitted to share their owners' bed: "He's my favorite dog I ever had. . . . He would come sleep in my bed. . . . He would try to push me off. He would come and stay and either curl up on his side or curl up down at the bottom. . . . We have pictures of him stuffed under the covers, his head on a pillow and the covers up to his neck" (29-year-old male, athletic club manager). "Tyler's pretty funny. He likes to cuddle with me, and when I come home from school I usually sleep in the living room with Tyler at night. He snuggles to me, and he looks really sad when I leave for school" (22-year-old female, college senior). Consumers and their animal companions commonly develop a mutually evolving relationship-a phenom- enological interaction-that defines their lives together. They find they can communicate in subtle, nonverbal ways grounded on mutual understanding and experi- ence. Much like long-term human friends, they "grow into" one another's lives through daily rituals and habits of behavior: "Mac and I would go for walks every night and if I forgot, he would remind me. After dinner I would be reading a book or a newspaper and he would come up and put his head on my knee. . . . And he'd lead me back [to where] I'd hang his leash on a peg near the back door and he'd put his nose right up to the leash and wag his tail. It's little things like that that just be- come part of your environment. . . It's a kind of mutual training going on" (33-year-old, male, book ed- itor). Very poignantly, these consumer-and-animal rituals can become so deeply ingrained that they are difficult to extinguish, even after the animal's death. When he was "around 7 or 8," Mac, the dog just mentioned, was struck by a car and killed. About a month after Mac's death, his friend and owner recalls standing in the kitchen, when he heard a squeaking sound from a nearby flagpole: "Well, the flagpole with the rope, when it was windy on a night like tonight, it would squeak in such a way that it sounded like Mac at the back door. . . One night in November it was windy, and I was standing in the kitchen, and my mom and I were talking about something . . . and I hear the squeaking and I go to the back door and I put my hand on the knob to let Mac in when I realized, Mac isn't out there. . . . You just get used to having them around." For consumers for whom human companionship has been difficult or strained, animal companionship can provide deeply needed emotional support and solace (Savishinsky 1986). Several researchers have described the use of dogs and cats to provide emotional therapy to troubled or physically damaged children and adults (Cass 1981; Corson and Corson 1980, 1981; Levinson 1969; McCulloch 1983). In one interview researchers encountered a 55-year-old female groomer and breeder who voluntarily had developed the practice of sharing her companion animals-a cat and a bloodhound- with others. She took in boarders and at one point had two Vietnam veterans rooming at her house: "I had veterans living with me and they liked this cat, so I let them keep her. She did wonders for them. Each night she would sleep with a different one. . . And they pampered her and they petted her-the physical touch, we all need it. . . . [The animal] will give you back all that body language and feeling of devotion and af- fection and loyalty and thought. . . . They are not going to criticize you. . . . They fulfill in peo- ple . . . a tremendous need for physical contact, emo- tional contact, of telling them your troubles." This same woman would also take her bloodhound to nursing homes where patients would be able to pet it: "There was one girl there that suffered from some sort of crippling disease. . . . She was all bent in and her head was at an angle and her hands were twisted. It was pitiful to see. And I went up to her with the dog and she was grinning from ear to ear just to see the dog. And he put his head on her knee and I put his ear on her knee and the nurse stroked the dog's ear with the girl's hand. This girl just beamed! I've never seen any response like that." In such instances, the consumer is generously sharing the companionship of his or her an- imal friend with others who need it. Animals as Self Several researchers have commented on animals as representing an extension of their owners' personalities, selves, or ids; thus, finding evidence of these roles in our interviews was anticipated. Feldmann (1979) was one of the first to observe that "pets can be extensions of how pet owners see themselves, i.e., confirmation/ validation, or would like to be seen, i.e., compensation" (p. 18). Similarly, Savishinsky (1986, p. 120) writes, "To the extent that pets are ego extensions, a person's choice of an animal is an act of self definition." And Beck and Katcher (1983) propose that this identification phenomenon is especially common for men who own "large, aggressive male dogs" (p. 253). In these instances particularly, the male owner identifies strongly with the sexual potency and virility of his dog and may react very negatively to suggestions by the veterinarian that the dog be neutered (i.e., castrated). In our interviews, few explicit (or even masked) pro- jections of self-identity onto pets were encountered. However, the few instances in which this occurred did appear consistent with Beck and Katcher's (1983) ob- servations. In the most obvious case, a 21-year-old male</page><page sequence="6">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 621 college student described to the interviewer a dog he and his seven male roommates adopted from a nearby animal shelter. They adopted the dog believing it to be "half Doberman and half German shepherd," but it has turned out to be something of a disappointment to its male owners: "The dog we named Axel Foley [af- ter the Eddie Murphy character in Beverly Hills Cop]. . . . We thought it was going to be a killer attack dog, but it's a baby. It doesn't even bark at anybody when they walk in the door." Later, he notes, "I always liked big dogs and this is the first time we ever got one . . . but it isn't like a killer attack dog or anything. [But] he's still fun." The consistently used phrase "killer attack dog" cou- pled with the purposeful selection of a dog believed to descend from two reputedly aggressive breeds (i.e., Doberman pinscher, German shepherd) and the choice of a name drawn from a machismo fictional character, strongly suggest that the dog embodies these owners' desires to be viewed as tough and powerful. Poised as the dog's owners are between boyhood and manhood, they appear especially concerned that their pet represent the appropriate, masculine image. Another form in which the animal-as-self role man- ifested itself was not anticipated from either the liter- ature or from personal experience with animal com- panions. This form I labeled persona perception. In several interviews, human family members commented that a companion animal's personality matched or rep- resented the personality of the animal's human owner, about whom they were speaking. Keith, a 26-year-old bartender, stated, for example, "[My brother Scott's dog] was this little beagle. [It] had a mind of its own, pretty much. Took anything it wanted and didn't listen to anybody. We'd tell it to sit and it would run-kinda like do the opposite of what you told it, kinda like Scott. . . . Dogs take on the personality of their owners, you know . . . and Duke fit Scott's personality . . . a selfish little baby, that's what Duke's like." Similarly, a 22-year-old mother, Valerie, observed, "The cat's like my husband-skinny and long and eats like a greedy hog." About her sister's cat, this same women commented, "She's [the cat's] exactly like my sister, Sandra. She's lazy; she lays in bed, she thinks she's cute, and she just hangs out." In these cases, the consumer's pet seemed to serve as a projective repository or synecdoche for negative feel- ings directed at him or her by a family member. Animals as Family Members Between 70 percent (Beck and Katcher 1983) and 99 percent (Voith 1983) of pet owners define their animals as family members. Among our interviewees, similar results were obtained, with approximately 80 percent spontaneously describing their pet as a "member of the family." However, the familial role performed by the animal varied across those to whom we spoke. After carefully reading and rereading the interviews, I found that two distinct patterns emerged. First, among youn- ger, single people (aged 18-25), family animals were most commonly viewed as siblings, that is, as brothers or sisters. Whereas, for young, childless married couples or for older, empty-nest married couples, the animal was most often seen as a child or baby. I first describe the role of animals as siblings and then subsequently their role as children. Animal Brothers and Animal Sisters. For several of the young adult consumers to whom we talked, a fa- vorite dog or cat often served as a brother or sister. A male 21-year-old college senior recalls the arrival in his family of a French poodle named Shu Shu, who is now 11 years old: "We've had him since he was four months old. We picked him up from one of my father's good friends. . . . I remember pictures with him laying in my Mom's arms and stuff like that. We have a picture of him with sunglasses on-it was pretty funny. . . . [Once] he got stung on the nose by a bee and I ran over to get him away from the bees and I got stung. It was pretty funny." This young man's recollections reflect the arrival of his "brother-dog" into the family and his own older brother role in protecting his younger sibling from harm. However, unlike his dog-brother, the young man has now grown up and left home for college where he faces numerous adult responsibilities. Somewhat wist- fully he describes Shu Shu's present life at home with his parents: "My dog at home, Shu Shu, leads a life like a king. He just wakes up, sleeps probably 15 hours a day, runs around, eats, sleeps, and lays on the couch. He goes outside whenever he wants and has no problems in the world." Occasionally sibling dogs were assigned regular household tasks and responsibilities, just like their hu- man brothers and sisters. A 19-year-old college sopho- more describes his dog's household duties: "He learned to do regular things. . . . We had this dishwasher [and] the dog had like a job. . . . When we were doing the dishes, we would just stick the plates in and the dog would stick his head in and lick them off." And just as human brothers and sisters do, animal brothers and sisters occasionally inspired episodes of sibling rivalry. A 22-year-old woman said of her family's pet dog: "He's very spoiled. Everyone loves him; both of my parents love him very much and he gets a lot of attention. . . . When we got this new little bed for him, we were joking about the way he . . . knows it's his, and my Dad had a friend take a video of it. . . . Sometimes I have to compete with him for leftovers. If we get take-out [food] or something and I want to bring it back to school with me, I have to fight [for it]. My parents say, 'Poor Prince, what's Prince going to eat? You're taking Prince's food away from him.' And it's good food, like spaghetti or some kind</page><page sequence="7">622 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH of macaroni or chicken. . . . They just want to give it to the dog." This informant-because she was a hu- man-had the misfortune of growing up and leaving home. In her absence, her parents have expanded the role of her stay-behind dog-sibling. He is now their fa- vorite, their perpetual child. Animal Children. As numerous researchers have documented, animals make fine children (e.g., Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). Feldmann (1979) was one of the earliest to describe this phenom- enon: "A pet can allow potential parents to experience aspects of parenthood through practicing nurturant be- havior and experiencing the results. . . . A pet can be a permanent surrogate child to some childless cou- ples. [The pet can become] a child-substitute-a canine or feline child who can never grow up" (p. 18). Analogously, Savishinsky (1986) observes that pets may also effectively serve as child substitutes for older cou- ples whose human children have grown up and left home. As he writes, for those experiencing the "empty nest syndrome . . . the cure is to adopt a pet and be- come a born-again parent" (p. 119). Consumers have very different expectations for their animal children than for their human children. Whereas human children are expected to mature sexually and attain competency and independence as individuals, animal children are kept in a state of perpetual im- maturity and dependence. They must "always" be looked after, cared for, and protected from harm (Beck and Katcher 1983). Animals not only function as children for many con- sumers, they are incorporated into many rituals nor- mally reserved for children. Beck and Katcher (1983) report that almost 30 percent of the pet owners they surveyed celebrated their pet's birthday in some way. Some purchased special pet-shaped birthday cakes and dressed their animal up in appropriate birthday regalia (e.g., party hats and bibs). Among our interviewees, several celebrated their animal's birthday by giving it parties or even taking it out to eat (e.g., McDonald's). Several also gave Christmas presents to their pets, much like in the Wallendorf and Arnould (1991) study that reported family pets often participated in the Thanks- giving meal. Similarly, animal children may be taken to special barber and beauty shops, bought special clothing, and taken to the doctor (i.e., veterinarian) when they are sick (Beck and Katcher 1983). They are spoken to in a higher voice than the consumer would normally use, and the cadence of speech is slower and more rhythmic-the voice usually adopted when talking to a child (Beck and Katcher 1983), which Serpell (1986) refers to as "Motherese." Animal children may also be enrolled in increasingly common "play-groups" (see Sanders [1990] for an enlightening discussion of puppy kindergartens) and, ultimately, laid to rest in pet cem- eteries (Serpell 1986). Because of the central role many animals play in the lives of their human families, their passing is frequently marked by funeral rituals of burial and/or cremation. Three of the informants to whom we spoke kept the ashes of their cremated pets in their homes. A 33-year-old man, married but childless, provided an eloquent description of the importance of his two dogs, Fisto and Tootles, in his life: "I started think- ing why do I have a dog and why do I want a dog. . . . People always say its the unconditional love, but it's not really. . . . You do have to feed them and groom them, you do have to take them to the vet, you do have to let them out, and they do chew your furniture and your socks . . . and they are demanding. And they are a pain in the neck sometimes. . . . They are just like children. They simply never grow up. You can never ship them off to college and say 'Fine, that's it.' . . . They're completely dependent on you for their livelihood, for their emotional well-being, their physical well-being. . . . You're gonna take these animals into your home and you are obligated, morally obligated, to take care of them and see that they have, to the extent that dogs are able, a happy life." As children, animals are given special attention and privileges. Often our informants told us of how their animals would eat at the table, sharing a spot with the rest of the family. Others were even luckier, like the cat described by his owner below: "In the evening he lays on my lap until he gets his ice cream. . . . He waits and keeps looking up at me, making me feel guilty. Then when I get to the end, I save him the last spoonful. I have to soup it up, because he doesn't like it real hard, so I gotta make it a little mushy for him. . . . Oh, he's so funny!" (55-year-old married woman, whose children, ages 17 and 19, have left home). Animal children are emotionally involved with their families. They provide the lavish affection and boister- ous greetings often supplied by young children. John and Fred, a gay couple in their late twenties, have re- cently adopted two kittens. They are delighted at the affection this has brought into their home: "When she [Iggy the cat] gave me a kiss when we were downstairs, did you notice that? She gave me a kiss on the neck. . . . When she sees [me] going out, she runs to the window and she looks at [me]. Then I go up and give her a kiss goodbye." Animal children often seem to respond to their par- ents' interactions much as human children do. When the parents argue, they become upset and hide: "If Tom and I start to argue about something . . . like arguing politics or something, Fisto goes upstairs and hides in the closet. . . . He always does it when we argue. He goes upstairs and hides. He crawls underneath all the clothes, so that he's totally trashed the closet upstairs" (32-year-old woman, married with no children). As children, animals are often taken on recreational excursions by their parents. Several informants reported taking their animals-cats, dogs, and ferrets-on car</page><page sequence="8">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 623 rides. The proud 46-year-old mother of a beagle named Buggles provided the following description of their typ- ical weekend automobile outings: "She sits in the mid- dle of the seat between my husband and I, and she'll sit on my lap, and she'll look out the windows at all the trucks and everything that goes by, and she's really smart. If you say words like 'cows' or 'deer,' she gets all excited and her whole facial expression changes. And she'll see these cows and she just goes crazy over them." Parting from animal children is often painful and emotion filled, whether planned or unintentional, tem- porary or permanent. One informant, who boarded dogs for owners on vacation, understood this anxiety well: "Each one of these animals is somebody's beloved pet. These are people who are in a total panic about leaving their dogs. They'll cry, they'll carry on. It's terri- ble. . . . They're putting that creature that they love so dearly in your hands and they're trusting you, and you have to respond to that trust." Some partings are accidental, as when an animal be- comes lost. Several informants reported making exten- sive searches for animals that "ran away" or "got lost." One of the most emotionally vivid accounts was pro- vided by a 55-year-old married woman, whose grown children were away at college, and whose pet ferret, Bandit, had disappeared: "She got lost for two days. Oh, I almost had a heart attack. I couldn't sleep. I was running out looking for her at 12:00, 1:00 in the morn- ing. I couldn't find her. It turned out the dog catcher had her. The police called me and told me they had her, but its going to cost you $31.00. I said I'll be right there. I don't care about the $31.00, I just want my ferret back. . . . When we got him back, he was sick for about a week. . . . He'd lost a lot of weight. . . . But we got him back. I was so glad to get him back. Oh I was so happy! He was licking me all over, you know. He was so happy to see me!"8 Perhaps the greatest tragedy of having animals as children is that, as one informant put it, "You'll always outlive them." One of our informants, a married but childless 33-year-old man, recalled the childhood death of his favorite dog: "When Mac died, someone had taken him off the street and brought him over. And he was on the front porch, and I was with Michael when Mom called. So I came back . . . , and he was dying on the porch. He was waiting for me to come home to die. I remember I said, 'Mac.' I saw him look at me, he recognized me. I just felt him leave, you know, die. . . . I've lost uncles and aunts; I've even lost a parent. But I think about him dying and I still want to cry." EMERGENT THEMES The notion that pets may function in consumers' lives as extensions of self, as friends, and as family members has been observed and commented on in the social sci- ence literature previously. The present research inquiry did not originate these themes, although I do hope to have extended them in some novel directions. However, in the course of analysis two additional themes emerged that enhanced understanding of the relationship be- tween consumers and their animal companions along largely untraveled avenues. The first emergent theme extends conceptualizations offered by anthropologists such as Leach (1964) and Sahlins (1976), who have observed that pets reside in an intermediate position between nature and culture. For example, taboos exist against eating pets (as opposed to "food" animals) since they are infused with anthro- pomorphic qualities (Beck and Katcher 1983). While we also discerned, and will discuss, norms surrounding cannibalism toward companion animals, our interview data suggested additional ways in which pets serve as mediators between nature and culture. The most prominent of these was an emic term used by several of our informants to categorize their pet: inside versus outside. As we will describe, some companion animals (usually those most anthropomorphized in their owner's eyes) are "inside" animals exclusively; they never are permitted "outside" the family residence. Other com- panion animals are exclusively outside pets; they do not enter the family home but remain outside nearby. Other companion animals occupy an intermediate sta- tus, being allowed both inside and outside the home at will. Multiple subtle meanings attach to this set of sta- tuses and will be described and illustrated at length in subsequent discussion of this theme. The second emergent theme is linked to the work of several investigators who have commented on the utility of families keeping companion animals to help teach children to be responsible and nurturant (see, e.g., Feldmann 1979; Savishinsky 1986). The central motive of such behavior is to socialize children to become em- pathic caregivers so that, as adults, they will be better parents (Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988). While we found evidence of these behaviors in our interviews, we discerned also an intriguing exten- sion of the thesis that we had not encountered previ- ously in the literature. This was that consumers who had been socialized to care for a particular type of pet as children often continued to seek out that same type of pet throughout their lives. These companion animal preference patterns often displayed a remarkable degree of specificity, as, for example, the woman who cared for a series of orange tabby cats over her lifetime, or 8Note that Bandit's gender is ambiguous. His owner refers to Bandit as both "he" and "she." Although not common, there were other instances of this in our interviews. Our interpretation of this phe- nomenon is that for some consumers, particularly those who see their animals as children, the animal is perceived as essentially asexual or genderless. Because it is to be kept in an immature, childlike state, gender assignment is not only unnecessary, it may subconsciously be seen as undesirable. One attractive aspect of such animals to their owners is that they will never mature sexually and leave to create families of their own.</page><page sequence="9">624 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH the man who "always" kept German shepherds as pets. I turn now to a discussion of the two themes. Mediating Nature and Culture In commenting on the phenomenon of animal com- panions, Leach (1964) proposed that pets form a me- diating category between humans and animals, having aspects of both but being fully neither one or the other. Similarly, Sahlins (1976) proposed a continuum of do- mestic animals extending from those that are most an- thropomorphized (e.g., dogs) to those that are consid- ered least humanlike (e.g., cows, pigs). Those closest to people in society's perceptions are rarely/never con- sumed as food (for to do so would constitute cannibal- ism), whereas those most distant are seen as suitable for consumption. Several references to cannibalistic practices were en- countered in our interviews, elucidating diverse man- ifestations of this practice. One 22-year-old college stu- dent provided the following description of his pet mice to an interviewer: Informant: I had mice. I started off with a couple of mice and then the next year I had about 40 or 50 mice, you know, little babies. But sometimes there were so many babies, the parents or other mice would eat the babies. I would go in and . . . see one that's half chewed up. . . . So it was kinda gross. Interviewer. Why do you think they do that? Informant. I have no idea. I don't think mice have too much reason in their little tiny peabrained skulls.... Maybe out of anger or territory or something like that. They're kind of unique animals, that [engage in] canni- balism. This informant speaks to us of intraspecies infanti- cide-a practice that appalled him and led him to soon move on to more human (and humane) pets-a dog and a cat. As I shall discuss later in this section, several consumers gave up keeping animals that were perceived as too irredeemably wild or Other. The tendency of a species (e.g., rodents) to destroy its own young was a signifier for this informant that the distance between self and animal was simply too great to permit mean- ingful bonding. In other incidents, our consumer animal owners as- sisted predation among fish. "A half year ago we had a fish tank. . . . We had snakeheads and a piranha. We had the best time, because we would throw a dozen goldfish into the tank and he would eat them all up and spit them out. It was pretty fun. They all ended up dying, because we couldn't [afford to] feed them. . . . The last one that died, we ended up flushing down the toilet" (20-year-old male college student, single). In this account, the informant clearly views the gold- fish (which some consumers keep as pets) as essentially live bait or live food. Their rapid demise in the mouth of the ravenous piranha provides entertainment. Not surprisingly, when the piranha becomes economically burdensome, it is also discarded in an objectified man- ner. In several interviews, we detected that fish and other aquatic or reptilian animals were not endowed by their owners with anthropomorphic qualities. The failure to achieve identification or bonding leaves these animals susceptible to easy abandonment and discarding. They are not seen as "really alive" but, rather, as interesting or exotic objects. One of the most evocative accounts of the dichotomy between anthropomorphized animals and those viewed as, or transformed into, commodities was provided by a 50-year-old male elementary school principal. As a child, his family kept goats and chickens in the backyard for milk, eggs, and meat. They also had two pigeons that, significantly, had been given names (Silver and Bluebird). These birds were considered pets by the chil- dren and were "tame." One day "we found out that the pigeons were attracting rats. And . . . my father de- cided to get rid of them, so he killed them and made chicken soup out of them, and that bothered me very much." Interviewer. Did you know you were eating them? Informant: I found out the next day we were eating Silver and Bluebird. Interviewer. Did your parents have any problem eating them? Informant: My parents were from the old country. Interviewer: Which means? Informant: Which means that whatever you raise, out- side your children, is for consumption. They made a nice chicken cacciatore with a tomato base and okra. It was very tasty. I found out the next day it was Silver and Bluebird. This transcript excerpt is particularly compelling on several accounts. First, it illuminates the importance of anthropomorphism in defining the status of companion animal versus food animal. To the children, the two pigeons were tamed and named playmates; hence, they were viewed as bona fide family members. Conversely, to the parents, the birds were pests that attracted vermin. Hence it was entirely appropriate, in their view, to transform the birds into food-it simply was the prac- tical, sensible thing to do. The emotional shock of this vignette is due to its conveyance through the recollec- tions of the now-adult child whose pets were not only killed and eaten, but served to him for dinner. Of course, as Beck and Katcher (1983) observe, we would have been even more horrified had the parents served their children a cat or dog cacciatore. The willingness of our informants to feed small fish to large fish, but to be disgusted when mice eat their young and pet pigeons are fed to small children, reflects a cultural hierarchy within which pet animals are ar- rayed. Fish, reptiles, and amphibians-the cold-blooded vertebrates-appear to occupy the lowest level of this hierarchy, while birds such as pigeons, parakeets, and canaries occupy the next higher rung. Above them come rats, mice, gerbils, and hamsters (i.e., the rodent rung).</page><page sequence="10">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 625 And at the top are the most humanized and anthro- pomorphized of animals-cats and dogs. In the inter- views, animals at the lower end were more likely to be objectified and commoditized-viewed as food for self or others, discarded down a toilet or in a garbage can ("all used up, toss it out"). Those near the top are pro- tected (to some extent at least) by cultural views that they are too much "like us" to be treated so casually.9 The norms discerned among our pet owners may be extended to observations regarding current American attitudes toward endangered animal species. For ex- ample, it appears easier to generate public support for the preservation of large land mammals, such as pandas, wolves, and wild horses, than for endangered species of birds, for example, the spotted owl, or fish, for example, the snail darter (Begley 1993). A similar case in point was the recent controversy over the destruction of dol- phins (a warm-blooded mammal) in gill nets intended to catch tuna. Public sympathy was aroused for the dol- phin by drawing explicit analogies between this species and the human species. Consumers were informed that dolphins travel together as families, talk to one another using language, and, most vividly, that the mother dol- phin nurses her baby with milk. Similar analogies are constructed by environmental groups (e.g., Greenpeace) with respect to whales, which are also marine-dwelling mammals. The guiding principle here, of course, is that, to the extent other species can be made to seem more human, the stronger human opposition to their de- struction will become. What was a "them" becomes an "us," and our desire to protect our "own kind" is aroused. Other observers of animal companions view their nature/culture mediating properties in slightly different terms. Beck and Katcher (1983), for example, see pets as representing ourselves as infants: "The pet is the self as a child, still suspended between nature and culture, no longer part of nature, but not yet trained to live in adult society" (p. 88). The liminal nature of infants and children in American culture is reflected both in the popular jargon used to describe them and the posses- sions and literature with which they are surrounded. Children-not quite wild, not quite tame-are "rug rats" and "small fry." Or, as one colleague recently told the author when asked where his wife was: "She's at home with the puppies" (i.e., his two young sons). Chil- dren's rooms are often zoological preserves in which a menagerie of (stuffed) bears, dogs, cats, lions, gorillas, and rabbits dwell. Children's literature features bear families who face modern, suburban problems (i.e., the Berenstains), cats who wear hats-and then come back (Dr. Seuss), and journeys to "where the wild things are."'0 Indeed, we surround our children with animals to teach them how to be good humans-an ironic twist well appreciated by thoughtful observers such as Fer- nandez (1986) and Levi-Strauss (1969). Some theorists propose that, as humans grow into adulthood, they lose their animal nature by becoming separated from the animal part of themselves. Pet keep- ing enables us to keep in touch with our earlier animal selves (Beck and Katcher 1983). Feldmann (1979) in a related, but somewhat different, view sees pets as rep- resenting nature more fully: "A pet spontaneously ex- hibits emotions and natural functions and lives more nearly in accord with natural biological rhythms: feed- ing, elimination, exercise, rest, sleep, copulation, birth, death, aggression. These expressions of life help keep pet owners in touch with basic, universal aspects of hu- man animality" (p. 18). Or, as one of our informants expressed this same proposition: "People are interesting in that they go to a place to make a home and the first thing they do is clear off anything that resembles the natural environ- ment. . . . Then they lay down a carpet of grass, very uniform, kind of sterile looking thing, put up this house, the primary purpose [of which] is to keep this outside world out, so that they have a place that the birds aren't in, the rats aren't in, the flies aren't in. . . Then you go and you bring in dogs, cats, fish, plants, things that don't even live in the area, because it's too sterile and doesn't seem right. People are funny." The observations of this very insightful 33-year-old man remind us that consumers themselves often may have a more cogent grasp of the phenomena they live with every day than the social scientists who desire to study them. One of the most significant clues to un- derstanding how pets mediate between nature and cul- ture was voiced repeatedly in many of the interviews. In many ways and in many contexts, those interviewed had described their pets as being "inside" or "outside" animals. Inside animals were those who lived their lives entirely within the confines of the owner's home. Great anxiety was often expressed that the inside cat or dog or ferret would go "outside" and suffer negative con- sequences. Conversely, some pets were described as outside an- imals; these pets were not allowed in the owner's house (or chose to remain outside the house). Often, concern would be expressed by informants that an outside pet would come inside and negative consequences would occur (e.g., accidental defecation). Some pets had a dual status; that is, they were permitted to go outside and come inside. The owners of such animals would describe how they made special arrangements to permit this transition, for example, special pet entrances, opening doors at predetermined intervals, tying the pet out on a leash, and so on. The dialectical structure of inside/ 9Although, this casual treatment of humanized pets still does hap- pen. One informant reported taking the body of his dead dog, which he "loved very much," and tossing it out alongside a busy highway. '0Where the Wild Things Are is a popular children's book by Maurice Sendak.</page><page sequence="11">626 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH outside was found to be a powerful device for integrating several norms and behavioral practices that informants had described. My interpretation of the mediation of pets between nature and culture, based on these norms and practices, is described below. Inside The house is primarily intended as a human habitat. Pet animals are permitted within it to the extent that they conform to certain behavioral practices and respect certain boundaries. Nonpet animals (e.g., mice, roaches, termites, raccoons) are actively eliminated from being inside the house. Because many pets are highly anthropomorphized (i.e., seen as "mostly" human), they are often permitted in the house. However, their human owners rarely see them as fully human. Thus, most consumers we talked with had attempted to establish boundaries within their houses that demarcated where these humanized animals were permitted and where they were restricted. For ex- ample, some animals were permitted only in certain rooms (e.g., the den and kitchen); others were permitted to occupy only certain furnishings in a given room (e.g., a particular couch, chair, or bed); some were fed only in specified areas while others would be fed from the owner's hands, except at the dinner table, and so forth. What we were observing, in essence, were consumers' attempts to demarcate where the remaining "wildness" (i.e., nature) of the pet was to be permitted in their home (i.e., culture) and where that wildness was to be prohibited. The individual norms on this varied widely; different consumers were comfortable with different levels of di- rect participation by companion animals in their home life. For example, some readily permitted pets to sleep in their beds, while others viewed this as "dirty" or "disgusting." However, in virtually every interview we discerned some internal boundaries on pets' activities in the home. Consider these four excerpts: "One thing they are not allowed to do is crawl around on tables and things. They are not allowed on tables and coun- ters" (John and Fred, gay couple in their late twenties describing their two cats); "You should wash your cat every so often to keep them clean" (John and Fred); "We never have Mom come here unless we've totally vacuumed and sterilized the floor" (32-year-old married woman); "We never feed them food from the table be- cause, you know, there's too many germs and stuff' (40-year-old mother). As can be seen from these excerpts, consumers es- tablished several types of boundaries around their an- imal companions. John and Fred perceive their cats' feet and hair as potential contaminants, therefore cat feet and fur must be kept off areas where human food is prepared and consumed (i.e., tables and counters), lest dirt (disorder) mix with food (order) (Douglas 1966). In this example a useful analogy may be drawn with respect to human norms regarding the proper places for feet and hair. Human feet-and their coverings (i.e., shoes)-are culturally viewed as unclean. Hence they must be prevented from coming into contact with "pure" food, which is taken into the body. Humans do not normally walk around on counter tops; however, cats (and occasionally children) do, necessitating efforts to restrict their feet to the floor. Similarly, human hair is also seen as a contaminant when it comes into contact with food. Thus, this norm is extended to animal fur as well. The 32-year-old married woman describes a different kind of boundary and different form of contamination. Her mother (who has no pets) is seen as "cleaner" than all the areas in the young woman's home, which have been "dirtied" by the presence of her two dogs. There- fore, when the "pure" mother visits her home, a ritual purification/cleansing must be undertaken to tempo- rarily rid the home of its animal contaminants. Notably, dirt (e.g., dog hair) is removed (i.e., vacuumed), and wild pollutants (e.g., "germs," fleas, ticks) are eradi- cated, through "sterilization." The 40-year-old mother combines these two types of boundaries in her description of not feeding her cats from the table. Contact of the human hand with the animals' mouths occasioned by the transfer of bits of food is seen as inviting dangerous disorder and con- tamination ("too many germs and stuff'). Again a use- ful analogy may be constructed with respect to cultural norms surrounding human mouths. Humans permit (and often enjoy) other humans to use their mouths to kiss them on the mouth or body. Similarly, many pet owners we talked to enjoyed receiving (and giving) mouth to body or mouth to mouth kisses to their ani- mals. However, just as it is a cultural taboo for humans to consume food that has been in the mouth of another, so too do we extend this same norm to food which has come into contact with our pet animal's mouth. Human children learn this taboo early on and may use it effec- tively to protect their food from larger children. One young girl known by the author licks the corners of her candy and ice cream bars to prevent her older siblings from trying to take them away from her. Now let us consider a different type of boundary: "Dad keeps all of my stepmother's cats in one room. It's bigger than my bedroom" (22-year-old, female col- lege student); "She lived in the back hall where Mom let her in to get scraps and stuff after dinner" (28-year- old woman describing her father's pet bulldog); "My aunt and uncle had a dog, and they really didn't take care of it at all. They let it live in the garage. It was a small dog also. It was cruel. They wouldn't let it walk on the carpets. That's how my aunt was-all neat and tidy" (21-year-old male college senior). These latter three excerpts all deal with location boundaries, especially those involving enclosures of various types: a collection of cats is confined to a single room of the house, albeit one more than ample for a</page><page sequence="12">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 627 human; a pet bulldog is confined to a secluded area of the house (i.e., the back hall) where its food consump- tion is also confined; a small dog, whose owners fear its contamination of their home's interior, is confined to a liminal space (the garage) that defines as well its lim- inal presence in their lives. Where consumers choose to confine their pets says much about how completely (or incompletely) they have incorporated them into their lives. The central proposition derived from considering these and similar interview passages is that the more anthropomorphized the pet is in the perception of the owner, the fewer restrictions and boundaries placed on it within the household. That is, the more the pet is seen as a person, the more it is treated as a person. Outside The other half of the inside/outside dialectic is the concept of "outside." In the words of Maurice Sendak, this seems to represent "where the wild things are" to consumers. Across the set of interviews, animal owners attributed many dangerous qualities to outside. It was a region where their tamed pets could get lost (in a dis- ordered, wild world), could get hurt or even killed by fierce, wild animals, and could become dirty (i.e., con- taminated or polluted) by coming into contact with the unclean natural environment and its parasites (e.g., fleas, ticks). A well-reasoned description of this is provided by the 55-year-old woman who owns Bandit, the ferret. After her ferret had escaped outside, she became very fearful: "I was afraid while he was out there he was going to get hurt. Like an animal like a raccoon would have come up to him. . . . And he's so, so gentle. [Now] a ferret could kill a dog or cat . . . , if it is wild. But this one here is such a pet, such a spoiled thing, that he wouldn't know. . . . The raccoon would have killed him instead of him killing the raccoon. That's what worried me, because there's a fox back there, and raccoons." Some outdoor animals that our informants wanted to adopt and transform into pets proved to be too wild. These were animals that had originated outside and still retained too much of their outside nature to make the transition to an inside pet: "At this farm they had a huge barn with three kittens. And my father used to feed them, 'cause he'd feel sorry for them. When spring came along my sister said she wanted some cats, so he brought them home. Well they were wild cats, and ap- parently once they are born into the wild, you can never domesticate them. . . . These cats were so wild [at her house], they literally bounced off the walls. My sister had to tie them down when she went to work to keep them from destroying the house. . . . So she told my Dad she wanted him to take them back to the farm, because apparently you can't domesticate a wild cat." Thus, some animals are recognized by consumers as too "outside" to ever successfully make the transition to "inside" status. And some pets, no matter how tamed and humanized by their owners, are recognized as still having a wild soul that needs to be acknowledged and catered to. For example, Buggles, the beagle, is a dog so humanized that it eats at the table, goes on car rides, and sleeps with its owners. Buggles human "mom" re- ported that they are soon moving to a new house: "What's nice about this new house . . . is that it's got a lot of land, and we're gonna fence it off. We've got some woods and we're gonna put the fence back in the woods. And it's on a lake, so we're taking the fence right down to the water. She's gonna have a lot of room to run. She's gonna love it." Buggles is indeed fortunate, for its human parents do not deny its animal side and have carefully structured an environment that balances its wild and tame char- acter. The mediating structure of the fence provides it with entree to the natural world (i.e., the woods, the lake), while also safely confining it to the human house- hold. Simultaneously a dog and a child, it has been given the best of both worlds. Childhood Socialization and the Formation of Lifelong Preference Patterns Several social scientists have commented on the use of companion animals' to socialize children into re- sponsible and nurturant caregivers (e.g., Feldmann 1979; Savishinsky 1986). A succinct summary of this line of thinking is provided by the Working Party Council for Science and Society: "Pet ownership serves a valuable educative function for children. The business of looking after, feeding, cleaning, training, and caring for companion animals is thought to teach children all sorts of adult traits, such as gentleness, personal re- sponsibility, dependability, and self control. It un- doubtedly provides an opportunity to express nurturant behavior and . . . may help introduce children at an early age to many of the experiences and responsibilities of parenthood" (1988, p. 27). Although I did find evidence to support this notion across the set of interviews, I found an even greater pattern of children's parents becoming the caretakers of animals originally obtained with the intention of teaching children how to care for them. Younger people interviewed (e.g., high school and college students) fre- quently noted that their parents, especially their mothers, had "really" taken care of their pets. Further, now that these informants were away at school, the pet was left at home with their parents on a full-time basis. This resulted in a common pattern of the child's parent, again usually the mother, taking over care of the animal to such an extent that the animal became viewed within the family as the parent's/mother's pet. The origin of Buggles, the beagle, is instructive in this regard: Informant: The year she was in twelfth grade, about to graduate, [my daughter] found a beagle puppy that they were giving away. So we said okay. We went, looked</page><page sequence="13">628 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH at it. It was only like seven or eight weeks old. But we knew how much she wanted it, so we took it home. . . . And I said, look, this is your dog, it's your responsibility. I'm not going to do anything for it 'cause I don't like dogs. You're gonna take care of it. . . . So the very first day she brought him home, she was going out that night on a date. This is the very first day! The little thing is crying, I mean, you just took him away from his mother. It was awful to listen to it cry. And [my daughter] had gotten a little box from the grocery store. And put a blanket in it, and thought this little puppy was going to stay in it. So, we're sitting there in the kitchen, and all of a sudden this little dog comes up from the box . . . it was out of control. It was not going to stay in the box. Interviewer: You mean it just kept running around? Informant: Yeah. . . . So the next day, we got a cage for him thinking that when we go out or go to work, we'll put the dog in the cage and at night time, we'll leave it in there, otherwise it would go to the bathroom, 'cause you know it wasn't trained. So we put the dog in the cage that night and go to bed. Two, three o'clock in the morn- ing, there's this metal tray at the bottom of the cage. The little dog would stand up, and it would jump on the tray where it would go vavoom, vavoom, vavoom, I mean really big time. It would make such a roar. Everyone was saying: "Shut that dog up," so I would go downstairs and open up the cage, sit on the floor, and the dog just curls up in my lap . . . and she fell asleep. So I put her back in the cage, and no sooner than I get upstairs, the same thing happened. She bangs on that tray. This just got to be a big problem 'cause I was up all night sitting for this dog, while my daughter's out having fun. So I think that's where I got attached to it. I mean I'd go down there, and I'd feel so good that I could help the little dog, stop the crying. And it just felt so warm. I mean, holding it, I felt like it was a baby. That was the first time I ever got at- tached to a dog. And from this point on, I think I'm one of those people that go nuts over dogs. I do, I baby them. My kids are grown, and I don't have any little ones around, but I do baby this dog. This narrative illustrates well the transfer of ownel- ship of the animal from the daughter to the mother. In such cases, the adopting parent typically comes to view the animal as his or her new child and the human chil- dren come to see the animal as their new sibling. Es- sentially, the family unit reforms itself to incorporate the animal as a bona fide family member. Simultaneously with the incorporation of the pet into the family, an enduring type of animal-human social- ization may occur: essentially, the children in such homes come to view the people-plus-animals family structure as normal and right. They develop deeply embedded expectations that when they become adults and form families, a pet should/must be included within the family structure to make it complete. And almost always (in our interview set), the type of animal they wish to include is a dog or a cat-the most anthropo- morphized of the animal species commonly kept as companions. Thus, it is likely that childhood socialization is central to the formation of lifelong preference patterns for companion animals. Within our set of informants, these preference patterns manifested themselves in diverse ways. Some were generalized longings and expectations that a pet should be present in the home: "Like a good, all-American type family, like a normal type family, you just get a dog; I mean, nine out of ten times you get a dog" (Scott, age 25); "We just have always had pets. I couldn't imagine a house without them" (Julie, age 22); "Animals are a great source of joy and love, love, love. They sort of complete the family picture in my mind. You have your spouse, kids, and your pets" (Laura, age 21). Other informants had kept a series of animals of the same breed over the years-a lineage that began in childhood and continued into their adult lives. One young woman who had grown up in a home with Australian terriers mourned when her childhood pet, Mousse, died. Within a month, she had purchased another puppy of the same breed, Tiffany, because she "could not get used to the house without some- body to come back to, you know, without somebody underfoot." Further, she has included this strong preference in her future marriage plans: "If my husband doesn't like [these] dogs, then I'm not mar- rying him." Preference patterns, we discovered, could also be or- ganized along color dimensions. Some informants re- ported having kept a long line of animals, especially cats, of a specific color or pattern: "All my cats, by the way, have been orange. We always got orange cats for some reason" (2 1-year-old woman). A final organizing principle for these preference pat- terns was to give a series of pets of a particular species the same name, in essence creating a nominal lineage, even though the animals were genetically unrelated. One 40-year-old woman had mourned the death of her cat, Audrey. A few months passed and a small kitten began appearing at her door: "I kinda felt like God sent her to me, because I had lost Audrey a few months prior and I would not have purchased [a cat] or let anyone give one to me because the hurt was still there. But Audrey II came into my life and . . . then I legally adopted her by giving her our last name, Jenkins. So she became Audrey II." This woman sees her new kitten as a spiritual de- scendant of the original Audrey. She believes an om- niscient force has recognized her loneliness and guided this new Audrey to her. Such consumers have bonded so closely to their animals that they see them as part of a life plan that was "meant to be." The tendency of consumers to anthropomorphize their pets is quite ev- ident, also, in the above passage. Not only has the new animal child been named, she (in the informant's view) has been "legally adopted" by the bestowing of the family name.</page><page sequence="14">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 629 DISCUSSION The present study has utilized the method of phe- nomenological inquiry to make an initial foray into consumers' relationships with their animal companions. The interpretation rendered is constructed from con- sumers' beliefs and recollections about their pets as re- vealed in dialogue with three interviewers. Although much has been learned through this approach, there remains a vast terrain of unexplored cultural knowledge surrounding companion animals that may be accessible using alternative interpretive approaches. Two of the most obviously appropriate are ethnography and semi- otics. Using ethnographic procedures, consumer research- ers could extend the pioneering studies of Sanders and his colleagues (Robins et al. 1991; Sanders 1990, 199 1) into novel areas. For example, participant observation studies could be conducted in homes and at veterinary clinics, pet shops, and animal shelters, as well as at tem- porary sites, such as cat and dog shows and obedience classes. In such venues, interview materials could be supplemented with photographic, video, and print doc- umentation, which could supply rich visual and arti- factual grounding for interpretations. In particular, the acquisition, socialization, and disposition processes for pets should prove to be especially amenable to study using ethnographic methods. A second, virtually unexplored aspect of the meaning of pet keeping in our culture may be accessible via semiotic analysis. At present there is literally a trove of narrative texts devoted to companion animals that, to the author's knowledge, has never been utilized within a consumer behavior context. Television and print ad- vertisements daily feature a variety of pet-related prod- ucts (e.g., food, medicines, grooming aids); these ad- vertisements encode many cultural beliefs about the meaning of pets and communicate diverse norms about their proper care (e.g., shiny fur, no fleas, no "doggy breath"). Similarly, companion animals appear regu- larly in motion pictures, television programs, and, es- pecially, children's fictional literature. A systematic analysis of these texts drawn from multiple sources would likely go a long way toward revealing cultural beliefs about companion animals that have heretofore been rendered "invisible" by their very ubiquity. Thus, there is substantial room for methodological diversity in exploring the companion animal phenom- enon. Let us now consider some unexplored substantive areas. In recent years, Belk (1988) and others (e.g., Hirsch- man and LaBarbera 1990) have advocated closer ex- amination of the enduring, emotional ties that con- sumers cultivate with certain possessions. As the present analysis has shown, consumers' animal companions are among those possessions they hold most dear and can exert a lifelong influence on their sense of self and fam- ily. Consumers and their animal companions are ca- pable of sharing bonds of intimacy that approach, or even equal, those they share with other humans. For this reason, pets can play extremely significant and constructive roles in consumers' lives, providing them with love, companionship, and friendship in ways that are undiluted by social status, materialism, or envy. The present inquiry has sought to explore these emo- tional bonds in sufficient depth to communicate their richness to other researchers in the hopes of stimulating additional investigation into this highly important, but little examined, aspect of consumer behavior. This study has emphasized the positive aspects of animal compan- ions; however, other researchers may find it fruitful to examine the dark side of pet ownership. As Belk ( 1988) observes, "Although pets . . . may be beneficial, they can also become harmful fetishes if too much of one's self and one's world is invested in them" (p. 156). In this regard, consumer researchers may wish to explore the viability of a linkage between consumers' purchasing of elaborate products and services for their pets and the manifestation of materialism and possessiveness (see, e.g., Belk 1985; Richins and Dawson 1992). Because pets are culturally recognized as semiotic indicators of their owner's personality, materialistic and/or posses- sive owners may be especially prone to "decorate" and pamper their pets. There are several additional areas of the animal-con- sumer relationship that remain unexplored and that could fruitfully benefit from increased research atten- tion. First, more direct attention could be placed on the acquisition process for pets. For example, what psy- chological and social negotiation processes occur within the individual and/or family that precede acquisition of an animal companion? Interviews with consumers actively engaged in this decision process would likely prove quite fruitful and could shed light on issues such as what family members are seen as having "standing" to contribute to the discussion. We could also learn how alternative pets are discussed and evaluated and who in the family is viewed as having the responsibility, and right, to select and care for the animal. Despite the fact that over half of the households in the U.S. have pets, few consumer researchers have attempted to find out how or why these animals got there (this, despite the fact that many, perhaps most, consumer researchers grew up in pet-keeping households and likely dwell in one at the present time). A second, significant area of pet keeping little ex- plored in the present inquiry is the breeding and showing ofpurebred animals. While many households keep pets, a portion of these households also engage in breeding purebred or pedigreed animals and in exhibiting these animals at competitive shows. These consumers often have an intense interest in a particular breed of dog or cat and engage in several highly specialized consump- tion behaviors to support this interest (e.g., purchasing special dietary, grooming, and housing products, selling puppies and kittens, attending obedience classes). In</page><page sequence="15">630 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH several respects, cat and dog breeders/exhibitors con- stitute highly organized consumption subcultures com- plete with their own specialized jargon (e.g., cham- pionship points, field trials), rituals of behavior, and status hierarchies. Closely related to this would be inquiries into pet ownership that carefully examined the possession of animals as markers of social status or evidence of con- spicuous consumption. Bourdieu (1984) presents a deep and richly detailed discussion of how modern consum- ers use the semiotic qualities of everything from musical preferences to leisure activities to food consumption in order to decipher one another's social position. This interpretive process, which Bourdieu (1984) terms dis- tinction, could be quite fruitfully applied to animal ownership as well. As noted at the outset of this article, rare and expensive pets often are used to communicate high social rank, yet a multitude of other social dis- tinctions may also be coded into the social meanings of various pets. Careful qualitative analysis could likely bring these to light. Another direction for future inquiry concerns the re- lationship of companion animals to the development and definition of consumer's sense of self. Recently, both Belk (1988) and Cushman (1990) have written de- tailed treatises on the meaning of selfhood in current American culture. Belk's notion of the extended self describes how consumers use a diverse array of cultural products from automobiles to children to form their identities. Cushman (1990) develops a historically grounded argument that consumption acts alone are not enough to "fill up" the achingly empty self of the modern age: "Our terrain has shaped a self that expe- riences a significant absence of community, tradition and shared meaning. . . . It embodies [these] ab- sences as a chronic, undifferentiated emotional hun- ger. . . . It is a self that seeks the experience of being continually filled up by consuming goods, calories, ex- periences, politicians, romantic partners, and empathic therapists in an attempt to combat the growing alien- ation and fragmentation of its era" (p. 600). What we have seen in many of the interviews con- ducted with consumers and their companion animals is an attempt to overcome this empty self by creating "community, tradition, and shared meaning" with a pet. The formation or completion of families with pets was a goal sought (and achieved) by many of our in- formants, and families are a significant form of com- munity. We have seen evidence also of the creation of family traditions surrounding the raising, caring for, and burial of animal companions. We have seen, as well, the creation of lifelong traditions for consumers who develop preferences for specific types of pets in early childhood and adhere to them throughout adult- hood. And further, we have witnessed the deep bonding between consumer and animal that is the intimate basis for shared meaning. Thus, there is likely ample oppor- tunity for consumer researchers interested in emotional response and commitment to direct their attention to the owner-animal bond. It is quite likely that the emo- tional attachment consumers feel for their pets is con- siderably stronger than that extended to inanimate pos- sessions. A reviewer asked, "What parts of the self does the relationship with pets nourish?" and in response I would answer, "Those parts that are left most vacant by mod- ern life." Much as Cushman (1990) proposes, these parts are a sense of history and tradition, a sense of emotional connection with living beings other than ourselves, and a sense that life has meaning beyond the quantities of material objects that are purchased, consumed, and discarded. It is possible that consumers and their ani- mals may bond in ways that resemble the modern model of marriage. In describing the folk comprehension of marriage, Quinn (1987) encountered several metaphors. Among these were (1) marriage as an ongoing journey, (2) marriage as a durable bond between two people, and (3) marriage as mutually beneficial. Much the same metaphors could be applied to the relationship between consumers and their companion animals (and, in fact, often were by the informants). The pet and consumer may journey through life together, partaking in each other's joys and sorrows. Ideally, they may form a strong and enduring bond that extends for the life of the ani- mal, and both may derive emotional benefits from the union. Further, just as in human marriages, some con- sumer-animal relationships may end in unhappy dis- solution or unequal dominance of one party by the other. Consumer and pet interaction has dated from pre- history (Working Party Council for Science and Society 1988), as has the larger interrelation between humans and animal life. In one sense, the consumer-pet rela- tionship is the "writ-small" version of the human-an- imal relationship "writ-large." Our attitudes toward our pets and their place in our lives likely reiterate cultural norms regarding the interplay between humans and an- imals. Recently, Wells (1993) has challenged consumer researchers to expand their intellectual horizons and to incorporate a more anthropological focus on "real world" problems and issues. In the attempts by con- sumers to incorporate animals into their lives in the role of companions, rather than possessions, it is possible that we may view as well the struggle now being waged between the traditional cultural view of nature as a set of resources over which humans have innate dominion versus the more recent environmentalist view that an equal partnership should be struck between the human species and the countless others that inhabit the planet (Begley 1993). Similarly, in the attempts by consumers to establish boundaries on their pets' places and activ- ities within the household, we may see reflected the larger struggle to allocate space to humans and animals in the biosphere. Social norms in both these domains are evolving rapidly and would likely provide a fertile ground for consumer researchers to initiate inquiries.</page><page sequence="16">CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMAL COMPANIONS 631 [Received June 1992.
