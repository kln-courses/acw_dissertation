THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AN EARLY CHRISTIAN CYCLE OF ILLUSTRATIONS FOR THE BOOK OF REVELATION - THE TRIER APOCALYPSE BY JAMES SNYDER From the earliest times the Book of Revelation was one of the most influential texts for the art of the Christian church in western Europe. It was in part the authority of Jerome, his commentaries and his prologues for the Vulgate, that established the Apocalypse of John as one of the most popular textual sources for the Christian artists.1 Time-honored themes and symbols, such as the Alpha and Omega, the Sacrificial Lamb, the Woman of the Apocalypse clothed with the Sun, and the New Jerusalem, were derived ulti- mately from the descriptions of these motifs in the Apocalypse. Moreover, many of traditional themes depicted in the mural decorations of the basilicas and cathedrals in western Europe the were apocalyptic, including such popular representations as Maiestas Domini, the Adoration of the Twenty-four Elders, and the Last Judgement. The significance of the imagery provided in the Book of Revelations has long been recognized, but the possible existence at some early date of extensive narrative cycles made up for the text itself has received little attention.2 1 A. M. Friend, Jr., "The Picture of the Second Advent, Frontispiece of St. Jerome's Vulgate Gospels, A.D. 384", (General Meeting of the Ar- chaeological Institute of America, December, 1925) American Journal of Archaeology, XXX, 1926, pp. 88-89. The impact of apocalyptic and chiliastic thought on early medieval art has been discussed frequently, see especially F. van der Meer, Maiestas Domini (Studi di Antichitd christiana XIII), Rome, 1938, pp. 5 ff., 435 ff. 2 For the nature of cyclic narrative employed in book illustration of the Hellenistic and Early Christian periods see K. Weitzmann, Illustrations in Roll and Codex, Princeton, 1947, p. 17: "By conceiving each changing situation of the text as a picture in itself, the artist creates now a series of consecutive compositions with separate and centered actions, repeating the actors in each and so observing at the same time the rules of the unity of time and place".

Of these the most important is a ninth- century codex in the Stadtbibliothek in Trier (Ms. 31) that contains one of the most extensive picture cycles for the Book of Revelation in all medieval art. At the same time, this manuscript provides us with an important key to the recovery of Early Christian illus- T.

The manuscripts in Paris and Valen- ciennes are very closely related and together with a third famous Apocalypse manuscript, the Bamberg Apocalypse (Bamberg, Staatsbibliothek, A II 42), preserve an early picture book of the Apocalypse datable to the sixth or seventh century. The Cambrai manuscript is probably a copy of the Trier Apocalypse (see below note 16). The four Apocalypse manuscripts have not been studied extensively - see M.

The Apocalypse in the Trier library contains seventy-four full- page illustrations (26,2 cm x 21,6 cm). The text, corrected at some later date to conform with that of the Vulgate, was written in one column of nineteen lines per page.5 The relationship between the text and the pictures is not clear. There are seventy-four miniatures, but there are only sixty-one divisions of the text indicated.6 Furthermore, the illustrations from folio 1 to 20 appear on the verso side, behind the appropriate textual passages, an inconvenience that was corrected on folio 21 where the text and picture sequence was reversed with the text moved to the verso side directly facing the proper illustration. Framed in red borders, the miniatures were executed in ink with a quill pen. Apparently the work of one artist, the drawings are bold and clear for the most part although the execution frequently seems hurried or careless. Color is sparsely used. In many miniatures the figures are merely tinted with pale water colors. In a few instances (espe- cially 56 r.), the miniaturist painstakingly modelled the draperies of the figures with opaque white and pink strokes and added highlights in the same fashion to the architecture and to the clouds. The style of the illustrations is difficult to localize, although there are some relationships with certain manuscripts of the School of Tours, particularly in the compositional arrangement of the episodes in registers.7 The iconographic types for the enthroned Christ 5 M. Keuffer, Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der Handschriften der Stadt- bibliothek zu Trier, Trier, 1888, pp. 34 ff.; H. Linke, Studien zur Itala, Breslau, 1889, pp. 22 ff., suggested that the original text of the Trier Apocalypse was based on a pre-Vulgate version; E. Braun, Beitrdge zur Geschichte der Trierer Buchmalerei im friiheren Mittelalter, Trier, 1896, pp. 49. ff. 6 The division of the text into sixty-one sections does not conform to the standard groupings of twenty-five capita as found in the Codex Amiatinus, the commentaries of Bede, Berengaudus, etc., the seventy-two kephalaia of Andreas of Caesarea, or the sixty-four storiae of Beatus of Liebana. For a discussion of these textual divisions see F. Juraschek, Das Rdtsel in Diirers Gottesschau, Salzburg, 1955, pp. 19-24. For the numerous Early Christian translations of the Apocalypse consult H. Vogels, Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der lateinischen Apokalypse-iibersetzung, Diisseldorf, 1920. 7 E.g. The Grandval and Vivien Bibles, A. Boinet, La miniature carolin- gienne, Paris, 1913, P1. XLIV, XLVII-L, CXXII-CXXV. For general 148</page><page sequence="4">THE TRIER APOCALYPSE that appear in the manuscripts from Tours also support this as- sociation, but these similarities are of a very general nature, and, as we shall see later, are probably due to the fact that the proto- type of the Trier Apocalypse belonged to the same early period as did many of the models that lie behind the productions of the scriptorium at Tours.8 Following a practice that was common in Carolingian book illustration, the artist composed the full-page miniatures by simply grouping or conflating several narrative episodes on a single page usually arranging them in superimposed registers with or without lines to separate them (Figs. 1-5). In the seventy-four folios of illustrations approximately 150 individual narrative episodes are thus presented. Folio 50 (Fig. 1), for example, displays five distinct activities simultaneously: (1) XVI. 3, "And the second angel (third from the left) poured out his vial upon the sea", (2) XVI. 4, "And the third angel (second from the left) poured out his vial upon the rivers", (3) XVI. 5, "And I heard the angel of the waters (lower left) saying: Thou art just, 0 Lord", (4) XVI. 7, "And I heard another, from the altar (third from the right) saying, Yea, 0 Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments", (5) XVI. 8, "And the fourth angel (fourth from the left) poured out his vial upon the sun". The arbitrary manner in which these various stylistic features see E. Braun, op. cit., pp. 49 ff.; H. Janitschek, Die Trierer Ada-Handschriften, Leipzig, 1889, p. 105; A. Goldschmidt, Die deutsche Buchmalerei, Leipzig, 1928, 1, p, 18. 8 For the iconography of the Tours Maiestas see W. Cook, "The Earliest Painted Panels of Catalonia", Art Bulletin, VI, 1923, pp. 47-60. The slightly provincial style of the Trier drawings rules out any direct connection with the masterpieces of the Carolingian schools, but certain evidence does point to a provenance in North France in the second half of the ninth century. Stylistic relationships with such works as the Genoels-Elderen ivory (W. Volbach, Elfenbeinarbeiten der Spdtantike und des friihen Mittelalters, Mainz, 1952, p. 94, Taf. 60), and the possibility that its illustrations were copied in a manuscript known to be in Cambrai as early as the tenth century, support this view. On the other hand, relationships in figure style can be seen in a miniature of the early ninth century and of North Italian origin (S. Paul im Lavanttal (Karnten), Ms. 41) - see 0. Homburger, "Ein vernich- tetes Denkmal merowingischer Buchkunst", Festschrift Hans R. Hahn- loser, Stuttgart, 1961, p. 192, Abb. 10. A late ninth-century date is suggested by the composite nature of the illustrations that have no parallels in earlier Carolingian miniatures. 149</page><page sequence="5">JAMES SNYDER episodes were compressed in the two zones of the miniature indi- cates that the artist of the Trier Apocalypse designed this page himself from smaller picture units in a model. At any rate, one can presume that the illustrations in the prototype of this cycle of pictures must have been considerably different from those in the Trier Apocalypse as far as the general composition and makeup of such pages as these were concerned. The impromptu nature of the ninth-century illustrations is especially apparent in the in- stances where the reading sequence was not only disturbed but inverted. In folio 19 v. (Fig. 2) the illustrator, working from the top left of the page to the lower right, put the Four Horsemen down in reverse order. What appears to be the first rider in the lower right-hand corner is Death on a Pale Horse, the very last to be sent out by the Lamb (VI. 8). At times the miniaturist, either fatigued or without models, spread one or two narrative episodes across the entire folio leaving vast empty spaces above them. In many he simply added an empty strip of sky across the top of the page to fill up the space. Near the end of his work he slowed down considerably, giving the reader only a single episode per folio for some of the lengthy descriptions concerning the Harlot of Babylonia (XVII. 1 if.) and the appearance of the New Jerusalem (XXI. 1 if.).9 In a number of illustrations he resorted to adding single figures or groups of figures to fill up leftover space. The witness, John the Evangelist, served as the favorite "filler" in this sense. The textual passages require his presence in less than twenty of the miniatures, but he appears over seventy times, either standing to the side holding a scroll or sitting frontally opening the scroll across his lap (Figs. 1-5). In a like fashion angels were frequently repeated where the narratives involved the sequences of the seven angels who blow trumpets, pour vials, etc. (Figs. 1, 4). Other groups of figures added arbitrarily include the various peoples of the earth, usually distinguished by their costumes: the servants of God and the nobility generally wear long tunics; the sinners, merchants, and peasants are clad in short tunics; and the soldiers wear costumes reminiscent of military uniforms of the Romans with leather hose and a chlamys over a short tunic. 9 Folios 53-56, 68-74.

For the Messages to the Seven Churches in Asia (Fig. 3) the bust of Christ appears as the One in the heavens above an arc that marks the celestial from the terrestrial realm. He commandsJohn, standing or sitting below, to write to the churches, represented by the angel and the church placed before the Evangelist. Finally, below them, in what seems to be a third zone of the miniature, an illustration of the message itself is given, i.e. in folio 10 v., five soldiers aligned there allude to the lines of the text that read "Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain. . . " (III. 2).10 A stricter organization is repeated in the illustrations of the narratives of the Seven Angels Blowing the Seven Trumpets (i.e. Fig. 4). In most of these illustrations the highest zone is an empty band painted blue with indications of wavy clouds sketched in with streaks of red and white. In the second register the seven angels with trumpets stand, placed more or less symmetrically about the angel or angels who blow trumpets. The lowest division is the terrestrial zone, and it is here that the effects of call of the trumpet are vividly illus- trated. With the sounding of the third trumpet (VIII. 10) and the fall of the star called Absinthium, we find the "many who died of the waters because they were made bitter". A similar organization was employed for the series of narratives for the angels who empty their vials as described in the sixteenth chapter of the Book of Revelation (Fig. 1). Here, in his attempt to illustrate the numerous happenings, the miniaturist omitted the empty strip of sky to provide more space for the illustrations of the destructions. A much more impressive compositional scheme appears in the numer- ous depictions of the Adoration of the Lamb or the One enthroned in heaven that reoccurs in the Apocalypse (Fig. 5, cf. folios 18 v., 23, 43, 61). The tripartite organization of the miniature here assumes a much stricter hieratic character. In the realm of the heavens appears the image of the Maiestas Domini - the Lamb or the One enthroned flanked by the four Living Beasts of the Apocalypse 10 Folios 6v. - 13v. In folio 7v. the Hand of God is substituted for the bust of Christ. Other minor variations are found in folios 6v., 8v., and 9v. The omission of the angel of the church and the illustrations of the messages in the Paris and Valenciennes Apocalypse cycles indicate that they belong to a different tradition - see Omont, op. cit., p. 66. 151</page><page sequence="7">JAMES SNYDER and, in some miniatures, angels in adoration.ll The second zone, inhabited by the elders or angels who adore the Maiestas Domini, is that of the heavens too, but of a lower degree. The lowest register, peopled by the innocents or the servants of God on earth, is usually marked by a green ground to indicate the terrestrial domain. The uniformity of many of these compositional types would seem to indicate that the model used by the artist of the Trier Apocalypse contained some of the more ambitious designs, espe- 11 This image, the Maiestas Domini, is frequently repeated in the Trier manuscript whenever the text refers to the Lamb or the One enthroned. cf. Van der Meer, op. cit., pp. 59 ff., 109 ff., 282 ff. Three types of beasts appear in the Trier Maiestas compositions. (1) Full-bodied representations of the beasts placed in the corners and turned inward. Counterclockwise from the top left they are the angel of Matthew, the lion of Mark, the ox of Luke, and the eagle of John, (folios 15v. - 20v.). While half-length beasts are common in fourth and fifth-century art, to my knowledge, the earliest representations of full-bodied beasts appear in the sixth century, i.e. Codex Amiatinus, Florence, Laurentiana, folio 796v. (Zimmerman, Vorkarolingische Miniaturen, Berlin, 1916, 111, Taf. 222) and the beasts with the Evangelists in the mosaics of S. Vitale in Ravenna (M. van Berchem and E. Clouzot, Mosaiques chretiennes, Geneva, 1914, Figs. 187-189). (2) Beasts in the form of six- winged heads lined in a row - ox, lion, angel, and eagle (folios 23r., 24r. with only two wings, 43r.). This type perhaps is derived from an early tradition established by a famous Palestinian prototype in monumental form that presented the Ascension of Christ with the winged Tetramorphs of Ezekiel below him. It was copied in numerous representations of the sixth century, e.g. Rabula Gospels, Florence, Laurentiana, Plut. 1. 56; frescoes in Baouit Chapels; and the Monza phials--see C. Ihm, Die Pro- gramme der christlichen Apsismalerei, Wiesbaden, 1960, pp. 95-108; W. Neuss, Das Buch Ezechiel in Theologie und Kunst, Miinster/Westf., 1912, pp. 154 ff. (3) Bust-length beasts in a row with human bodies - ox, lion, angel, eagle (folio 49r.). This curious anthropomorphic form appears in numerous eighth and ninth-century manuscripts in the North: Gellone Sacramentary, Paris, Bibl. Nat. lat. 12048, folios 42v., 115v. (Zimmerman, op. cit., 11, 154, 155); Gospels, Rome, Vat. Barb. lat. 570, folio 1 (Zimmerman, op. cit. IV, 317 a); Gospels, Poitiers, Bibl. de la Ville, Ms. 17, folio 31 (A.M. Friend, "The Canon Tables of the Book of Kells", Studies in Miemnory of A. K. Porter, Cambridge, 1939, 11, pp. 611-666; and W. Cook, "The Earliest Painted Panels of Catalonia", Art Bulletin, VIII, 1926, pp. 208 ff., Figs. 2, 11-20). Anthropomorphic beasts are also very common in Spanish Mozarabic book illustration including both the Leon Bibles and the Beatus Apocalypse commentaries (Neuss, Apokalypse, II, LXVI, LXVIII, LXXXVII, CXI, CXXV) and probably reflect an Early Christian tradition stemming froln North Africa where such hybrids were common in art. 152</page><page sequence="8">JAMES SNYDER: The Trier Apocalypse PLATE 1 1.

For the most part, however, it is apparent that the ninth-century illustrator gathered together two or more isolated illustrations in his model to form his own full-page compositions in the fashion common for Carolingian artists. One can conclude from these observations that the model behind the Trier cycle of Apocalypse illustrations was a richly illustrated codex with a few hieratic miniatures, perhaps also full-page in size, and numerous smaller column pictures, framed or unframed, scattered through the text in the manner often found in copies of illustrated manuscripts of the Early Christian period (cf. 'ig. 8).12 A number of iconographic and stylistic details provide us with clues as to the date of the Early Christian archetype of these illustrations. The portrayal of the One in heaven as the beardless Christus logos enthroned on a globe points back to sixth-century representations of Christ such as those in the mosaics of the apse of San Vitale and on the triumphal arch of Parenzo Cathedral.13 The personifications of the winds as nudes with winged heads and the presence of an angel in the role of a Victory figure also suggest motifs derived from Early Christian sources where pagan symbol 12 E.g. the following western copies of pagan and Early Christian manu- scripts: (1) Carolingian Terence manuscripts (L. Jones and C. Morey, The Miniatures of the Manuscripts of Terence, Princeton, 1931, 2 vols.), (2) Chronicles of Ravenna (B. Bischoff and W. Koehler, "Eine illustrierte Ausgabe der spatantiken ravennater Annalen", Medieval Studies in Memory A. K. Porter, Cambridge, 1939, 1, pp. 125-138), (3), Carolingian Prudentius manuscripts (R. Stettiner, Die illustrierten Prudentiushandschriften, Berlin, 1895; H. Woodruff, "The Illustrated Manuscripts of Prudentius", Art Studies, VII, 1929, pp. 39-79), (4) Carolingian Physiologus manuscripts (H. Woodruff, "The Physiologus of Bern", Art Bulletin, XII, 1930, pp. 226-253), (5) Catalan and Mozarabic Bible cycles (Neuss, Die katalanische Bibelillustration, Bonn and Leipzig, 1922). Cf. the discussion by D. Diringer, The Illuminated Book, New York, n.d., pp. 30-59; K. Weitzmann, Illus- trations in Roll and Codex, Princeton, 1947, pp. 69 ff., Figs. 56-87. Numerous examples can be cited in Byzantine book illustration, see Weitzmann, op. cit., pp. 70 ff., 89 ff., etc. For the term column picture see Weitzmann, op. cit., pp. 72 ff., 83 ff. 13 Berchem and Clouzot, op. cit., Figs. 184, 221. Other examples of this type appear in manuscripts of theTours School (Boinet, La mziniature carolin- gienne, Paris, 1913, pl. XXXVI, XLV) which presumably copy models of the sixth century. 153</page><page sequence="17">JAMES SNYDER and allegory often had a direct role in the formation of Christian types. Furthermore, details such as books in the form of scrolls, Roman costumes, antique furniture, and towered cities, closely resemble those found in the arts of the fifth and sixth centuries and earlier. 14 The archetype of this cycle could have dated as early as the fourth century, when motifs from the Apocalypse suddenly appear in abundance in Christian art due, perhaps, to the inspiration of the prologues and Vulgate translation of Jerome. To be more precise as to the date of the model employed by the illustrator of the Trier manuscript, however, certain stylistic features indicate that it belonged to the sixth century. The meager representations of landscape, the lack of interest in realistic detail, and the shallow integration of figures in space, resemble stylistic traits of works attributed to the sixth century such as the illustrations in the Gos- pels of S. Augustine and the Cotton Bible and the nave mosaics in Sant' Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna. 15 The hypothesis that the Trier Apocalypse preserves the essential character of an Early Christian cycle of illustrations for the Book of Revelation is further supported by the fact that the miniatures show no influence of the numerous commentaries on the Apocalypse that were widespread in Latin Christendom by the seventh and 14 Only a few of these relationships will be listed here. For sculpture see J. Wilpert, I sarcofagi cristiani antichi, Rome, 1929-1936, esp. tav. XXI, XXII, XXV-3, CXXI-2 and 3, for similar architecture, boats and chariots. Identical angel types and figure style appear in ivories reproduced by W. Volbach, Elfenbeinarbeiten der Spatantike und des friihen Mittelalters, Mainz, 1952, Abb. 48, 112-113. The angels with trumpets in mosaics on the arch of S. Michele in Affricisco, Ravenna (now Berlin), the angels and Christ type in the choir of S. Vitale, Ravenna, and the general compositions and figure style in the narrative mosaics of S. Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (Berchem and Clouzot, op. cit., Figs. 217, 184, 185, 190, 191, 145-169) reveal the same association. For book illustration see below n. 15. 15 The similarities between the Trier Apocalypse and the S. Augustine Gospels have already been noted by F. Wormwald, The Miniatures in the Gospels of S. Augustine, Cambridge, 1954, p. 15. Compositions such as that of the Message to Ephesus (Appendix, folio 6v.) are stylistically close to some of the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis such as the Peiresc copy of the Third Day of Creation (see K. Weitzmann, "Observations on the Cotton Genesis Fragments", Late Classical Studies in Honor of A. M. Friend, Jr., Princeton. 1955, pp. 112 ff. and Fig. 3).

The absence of tituli, such as those that accom- pany other Apocalypse picture books is still another factor in this respect. 16 At this point, it is instructive to analyze the illustrations of the commentaries on the Apocalypse written by Beatus of Liebana, because they too are important for the reconstruction of Early Christian illustrations. Next to the Trier Apocalypse the Beatus manuscripts contain the most extensive picture cycles for the Book of Revelation in pre-Romanesque art. The earliest examp- les with illustrations are dated in the tenth century, but historians of Spanish art are in general agreement that the prototype for the illustrated copies was probably the original manuscript of the commentaries made up by the author himself, Beatus of Liebana, a Spanish monk who lived in the Asturias in the eighth century. 16 For an analysis of these tituli see Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 239 if., and Juraschek, Die Apokalypse von Valenciennes, pp. 14 ff. The one exception is the Apocalypse manuscript in Cambrai, Bibliotheque municipale, Ms. 386 -see A. Molinier, Catalogue general des bibliotheques publiques de France, Departements, XVII, Cambrai, Paris, 1891, p. vii, 142; a complete descrip- tion of the illustrations is given in H. Omont, op. cit., pp. 84 ff., pls. XXTX- XXXT; also see Boinet, op. cit., Pls. CLIII-B, CLVI-A and B, CLIV-B. The Cambrai Apocalypse is probably a tenth-century copy of the Trier Apocalypse, and it has been generally assumed that it was the product of a scriptorium in North France since the manuscript was recorded in the Cathedral Library of Cambrai in the tenth century (a fact which might help locate the Trier manuscript at that time as well). Whether or not this pro- venance is the right one, one can observe that the Cambrai Apocalypse, with approximately twenty-seven folios missing, has forty-six full-page illustrations that copy those in the Trier cycle down to the smallest detail. Identical compositional arrangements, similar painting techniques with water color brushed over ink drawings, and many other agreements support this conclusion. Furthermore, there can be no question that the Cambrai illustrations are later than those of the Trier manuscript, and while some scholars have been troubled over the close relationships (the Cambrai Apoca- lypse is usually called a "sister" of the Trier), to introduce a third manus- cript with an identical picture cycle is an unnecessary complication. Cf. H. Omont, op. cit., p. 86; ( On peut ajouter qu'ils sont la copie sinon l'un de l'autre, du moins d'un original commun ). Neuss, Apokalypse, I, p. 249, refers to the Trier Apocalypse as the Schwester-Hs. of the Cambrai. That the Trier manuscript does not copy the Cambrai is suggested not only on stylistic grounds but also on the basis of the preliminary sketches in the back of the Trier manuscript (folios 74-75) that are much more detailed than the Cambrai versions and by the fact that books are occasionally substituted for scrolls in the Cambrai illustrations. 155</page><page sequence="19">JAMES SNYDER If this is true, then a comparison of the illustrations of Beatus with those of the Carolingian miniaturist would be of great interest and importance for this study. 17 The commentaries of Beatus are complex in their makeup with numerous texts and commentaries by earlier writers added to those of the author himself. The introduction is lengthy with a dedication to Bishop Etherius of Osma (a friend of Beatus), a prologue dedicated to John the Evangelist attributed to S. Jerome, a second prologue in the form of a letter from S. Jerome to Anatol- ius, and, finally, a summary of the commentaries presumably derived from a synopsis of the Apocalypse written by Tyconius, a fourth-century Donatist. 18 The commentaries of Beatus are gathered in twelve books. The books are organized according to the narrative storiae, sixty-four in all, taken directly from the text of the Book of Revelation, with each storia followed by the inter- pretation or explanatio of Beatus. Various digressions appear from time to time. At the beginning of Book Two, for instance, Beatus introduced a long Prologus de Ecclesia et Sinagoga that presents a discussion of the names, saints, heresies, symbolic beasts, etc. The second book ends with an interpretation of the ark of Noah as the model of the Christian church. In a number of manuscripts excerpts from De civitate dei (Book XX, ch. 19) of Augustine are added to Book Six together with complex tables for determining the name and the number of the Antichrist (cf. Revelation XIII. 17 The bibliography on the Beatus manuscripts is too extensive to discuss here, see Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 5 ff. Important cultural exchanges between France and Spain began in the eighth and ninth centuries under Charlemagne with his campaigns in northern Spain in 778 and his religious alliances with the Spanish against Adoptianism (Beatus of Liebana fought against this heresy). It was during the ninth century that there first appeared in Galicia the cult of Saint James which was to bring about the pilgrimage traffic that linked northern Spain and France so tightly during the Romanes- que period.

Finally, in many of the Beatus manuscripts the commentaries of Jerome on the Book of Daniel are appended to the text of Beatus.19 Clearly then, unlike the Trier Apocalypse, the Spanish texts display a complex compilation or anthology of diverse commentaries and writings relevant for the interpretation of the Apocalypse, and this fact is important when we turn to the illustrations of the latter. The illustrations in the Beatus manuscripts show the same diversity and mixed ancestry as the text. In general, two types of illustrations appear: full-page compositions of hieratic and em- blematic character and smaller narrative pictures presented in the form of framed or unframed miniatures scattered throughout the text. Those of the first type were borrowed, in most cases, from quite obvious sources. The Alpha and Omega, placed respec- tively at the beginning and at the end of the commentaries, were common symbols of Christ in the Apocalypse that appear much earlier in Christian art. The Cross of Oviedo, at one time a sign of Spanish resistance to the Moslems, was a popular apocalyptic motif employed frequently in Merovingian books, and in the Beatus manuscripts it is sometimes paired with an impressive portrait of Christ in Majesty that at once brings to mind the Maiestas Domini images in the manuscripts of Tours.20 Finally, as part of the introduction, portraits of the Evangelists that can be traced to Early Christian types were frequently introduced.21 The narrative illustrations, sometimes gathered together on one page in registers, display an equally mixed and confusing 19 Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 222-236. 20 Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 112-116, II, Taf. 1-5. 21 The Evangelist stands under an architectural enframement with the symbolic beast and presents his book to Christ who is enthroned to the left - Neuss, Apokalypse, JI, Taf. VI-IX. This little-known type survives in a ninth-century Italian Gospels, Perugia Capitulary Library, Ms. 2 (Diringer, op. cit., P1. VI-i, e-f), in the ninth-century Gospels of Livinius, S. Bavo, Ghent (K. Nordenfalk, Early Medieval Painting, 1957, p. 162), and in a thirteenth-century Spanish Bible, Madrid, Real Academia de la Historia, Mss. 2-3 (I thank John Williams, who is preparing a study of the Leon Bibles, for this reference).

Except for a few intrusions,23 the illustrations of the storiae proper corres- pond to the text of the Book of Revelation, and, in fact, there are some similarities between these pictures and the miniatures in the Trier Apocalypse as far as the selection of episodes illustrated and certain details of iconography are concerned.24 The fact that 22 In the introduction of some of the manuscripts, episodes from the life of Christ are added to genealogical tables that chart the generations from Adam to Christ, a popular device borrowed from Spanish Mozarabic Bibles. For the Prologus de Ecclesia et Sinagoga a sprawling representation of the mappa mundi as a direct reference to the Mission of the Apostles is often included, and, in one family of Beatus manuscripts, portraits of the Apostles appear at this point, and in others representations of the beasts and the statue from the Book of Daniel are added. At the end of Book Two one finds the colorful depiction of the ark of Noah to accompany the dis- cussion of the ark as the model of the church, and still another narrative cycle is appended to those manuscripts with the commentaries on the Book of Daniel with fanciful illustrations of such visions as Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the statue and the rolling stone (Daniel II. 1-34) and the dream of the tree into heaven (Daniel IV). These illustrations are unframed mini- atures in most cases suggesting that they probably were copied from a very early Book of Daniel with illustrations. For a discussion of these see Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 119-133, 222-236, II, Taf. X-XXVII, CXXXIX-CXLIV, XLVII-LII, LX-TXTTT; and Neuss, Die katalanische Bibelillustration, Bonn, 1922, p. 73, 89-94; Figs. 98-102, 169. 23 These are, significantly, found in the explanation of Beatus that follows the text of the storia including the palm tree that sometimes serves as an illustration for the commentary on Revelation VII. 4-12; "Quod autem ait, palmae in manibus eorum; nec inmerito justorum vita palmae compara- tur", with the murder of Elias and Enoch who are named in the tituli as the anonymous witnesses killed by the beast from the pit (XI. 7-10); and the fox and the chicken from Aesop's fable (?) that serve as pictorial foot- notes to the commentary for XIII. 11: "Vulpicula enim fallax est animal, et insidiis semper intenta rapinam fraudis exercet", Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 163, 176-180, 188, 189. 24 The authority on the iconography of the Beatus manuscripts, Wilhelm Neuss, rejected any relationship between the two, concluding that the Trier Apocalypse reflected an altgallischer Zyklus while the Beatus derived 158</page><page sequence="22">THE TRIER APOCALYPSE the miniatures in the Beatus manuscripts look nothing like the Trier illustrations in general stylistic features does not, however, rule out the possibility of a common archetype for the iconography of the Apocalypse illustrations. One must seek out the individual iconographic units for consideration and not regard the style of composition of the page as a whole when investigating these relation- ships. The Mozarabic style of the Beatus manuscripts displays very decorative, two-dimensional patterns of figures and objects on the page when compared to the more straightforward illus- trations in the Carolingian miniatures. The interest in colorful patterns led the Spanish artists to produce schematic and emblema- tic compositions with the narratives flattened into heraldic designs so that landscapes are pressed into maps and figures are simplified until they resemble badges or butterflies pinned to the page. Be- neath this colorful style of the Mozarabic miniatures one can discern vestiges of a more naturalistic prototype, however,25 and if one isolates the individual textual episodes for study rather than the page as a whole, a number of correspondences between these from an Early Christian prototype from Spain or North Africa (Apokalypse I, pp. 237 ff.) 25 Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 237 ff., I believe ,went too far with the theory that the S. Sever Apocalypse (Paris, Bibl.Nat., lat. 8878) best preserves the naturalistic character of the prototype of the Beatus illustrations. This tempting theory must be seriously qualified on numerous counts. The style of the S. Sever illustrations is Romanesque and, hence, appears more natural- istic by virtue of the fact that it is the least Mozarabic of the earlier copies. Secondly, the style of the Beatus original, if by Beatus himself, must be reconstructed on the basis of Asturian art of the eighth and ninth centuries and not on the style of the Early Christian period. Thirdly, the relationships that Neuss suggested between the S. Sever Apocalypse and the Ashburnham Pentateuch (Paris, Bibl. Nat., nouv. acq. lat. 2334) are extremely vague, and, furthermore, the date and the provenance of this key manuscript are still seriously debated both in terms of style and palaeography (Tours, Spain, or North Africa?). At any rate, there are no stylistic parallels to the Ashburnham Pentateuch known to me in Visigothic Spain, and the scanty remains of Christian art before the tenth century reveal a totally different picture including provincial copying of Late Antique models (e.g. the Icija sarcophagus, the jamb reliefs of San Miguel de Liiio, the frescoes of Santul- lano), parallels to Merovingian and Carolingian style (Bible of the Monastery of Cava dei Tirreni, frescoes in San Miguel de Tarrasa), and anticipations of the Mozarabic (Codex Toletanus) - for discussion and illustrations see J. Lozoya, Historia del Arte Hispdnico, I, Barcelona, 1931, pp. 171 ff. 159</page><page sequence="23">JAMES SNYDER illustrations and those in the Trier manuscript appear. First of all, it should be noted that the density of the illustrations in the cycle of the storiae illustrations in the Spanish books is about the same as that in the Trier Apocalypse, approximately 150 episodes, although this fact in itself means little. With a few exceptions, the lines of the text illustrated are identical in both groups, and, more important, some general iconographic relationships are apparent in a number of episodes. In the illustrations of some of the repetitive sequences, such as the Messages to the Seven Chur- ches, where John confronts the angel before a diminutive basilica each time, the similarities are perhaps of too general a nature to be of great value. More significant, however, are the organizations of the more complex visions of John, e.g. the Multitude before the Throne of the One in Heaven, the Adoration of the Lamb, etc., where similar tripartite hierarchies of figures appear (Figs. 5 and 6). In the illustration of the Four Angels holding the Four Winds the positions of the four figures correspond, and the appearance of winged heads held in the hands of angels as personifications of the winds might further indicate a common tradition.26 Of special interest is the comparison of the representation of the Four Horse- men in the Beatus manuscripts and the Trier Apocalypse. The first horseman in the Beatus of Valladolid (Fig. 7) is "given a crown" (VI. 2) by an angel or Nike, which the text does not specify, just as in the Trier illustrations for this passage (Fig. 2). The ad- dition of a demon with wings and arms upheld behind the fourth horseman as the infernus that followed him (VI. 8) is a pictorial motif that appears in the Carolingian representation in a some- what abbreviated form. Other similarities in the compositions, such as the two-by-two placement of the four horsemen, are pro- bably coincidental, but this mode of organization raises an interes- ting problem that was briefly discussed above. The order of ap- pearance of the four riders in the Beatus miniature makes better sense and is easier to read than in the Trier illustration simply because the horses are reversed in direction implying that they move out from right to left. The awkward inversion in the Trier picture can be explained, however, if one assumes that the artist worked from a model with individual column pictures, one for 26 Neuss, Apokalypse, II, LXXIII, LXXV, LXXVI. 160</page><page sequence="24">THE TRIER APOCALYPSE each rider, and that he composed them on the page as he worked from the top left to the lower right. In the Beatus of Valladolid (or its model) the organization was more meaningful. Fortunately, a good reflection of how such a sequence of column pictures would appear in an Early Christian manuscript is found in another Spanish book of the eleventh century, the Roda Bible in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (Cod. lat. 6),27 where the first eight chapters of the Book of Revelation are illustrated. Here again, as in the Trier and Beatus illustrations, two types of miniatures appear: the more impressive and hieratic visions of the Adoration of the Lamb, etc., and the smaller, more direct narratives presented in the form of framed or unframed miniatures here placed directly in the columns of the text.28 In the representation of the Four Horse- men (Fig. 8) we find a reflection of what the Early Christian arche- type could well resemble with each rider appearing in the column of the text after the appropriate lines. The presence of the crown offered to the first horseman and the diabolic infernus that follows the fourth suggest that the pictorial tradition may be related to those in the Trier and the Beatus cycles. This conclusion is born out by other comparisons, such as the series for the Messages to the Seven Churches where John, the angel, and the diminutive church appear in much the same fashion as they do in the Trier Apocalypse, but, again, dispersed through the text as individual column pictures.29 Admittedly, the evidence presented here does not permit one to ascertain the iconographic stemma for the pictures in these manus- cripts or to define their interrelationships very precisely.30 However, 27 Neuss, katal. Bibelill., pp. 10-15, 131-133. 28 Neuss, katal. Bibell., Figs. 173, 175-182. 29 The curious illustrations below the proceeding column in the Roda Bible, "and the kings of the earth, and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains" (VI. 15), while missing in the Trier Apocalypse, appears in much the same fashion in the Beatus cycle. Neuss, katal. Bibelill., Figs. 182, 183; Apokalypse, II, P1. LXXTT. 30 The Berlin Apocalypse (Staatsbibliothek, Ms. Theol. lat. 561) is a remote reflection of the same Apocalypse picture cycle. The text of the manuscript follows the commentaries of Beatus, but it is apparent at first sight that the style of its illustrations in no way resembles that of the Spanish books. Presumably the work of a Lombard scriptorium in the twelfth century, the Berlin Apocalypse has fifty-four miniatures, framed and unframed, 161</page><page sequence="25">JAMES SNYDER from these observations the existence of an illustrated Apocalypse of the Early Christian period, one that was transmitted to the later Carolingian and Spanish scriptoria probably through inter- mediate copies, seems certain. While both the stylistic and icono- graphic characteristics of this early cycle of pictures have been obscured in the Beatus illustrations, the simplicity and the direct- ness of Early Christian models are more faithfully preserved in the Trier copy. Any study of the iconography of the Book of Revelation must begin with this valuable manuscript.31 The University of Michigan, Dept. of the History of Art that reveal a distant kinship with the Trier cycle. The stylistic differences between this Beatus and those produced in Spain are disconcerting. Apparent- ly, the scribe of the Italian manuscript copied a standard Beatus text, while the illustrator had access to a non-Mozarabic model whose pictures belonged to the same Early Christian picture recension - Neuss, Apokalypse, I, pp. 247- 267; II, CLII-CLXIV; Vogels, op. cit., pp. 73 ff.
