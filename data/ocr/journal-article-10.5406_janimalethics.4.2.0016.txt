<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> the Fish Pain debate: Broadening  humanity’s moral horizon mAximiliAn PAddEn EldEr oxford centre for Animal Ethics, oxford, England. This article explores the moral complexities and inconsistencies in the perception of  fish welfare; mainly, that fish lack the ability to suffer and, therefore, exist outside of  humanity’s moral horizon. The science behind fish sentience has advanced to the point  where a serious discussion on the human-fish relationship is warranted. It is argued  that enough scientific evidence exists to provide evidence for fish sentience and suffer- ing. However, for those unconvinced in light of the lack of both scientific and popular  consensus, the precautionary principle, where we treat fish as if they may suffer, will  ultimately be advocated as an appropriate approach to fish welfare. Key Words: fish, ethics, sentience, cognitive ability, suffering, precautionary  principle, animal welfare Anna saw her fish gleam and flash like silver in the clear water as it neared the surface.  henry held the line short, letting the mackerel plunge and jerk, and then seized and  unhooked the catch.  “how cruel!” Anna cried, startled at the nearness of the two fish as they sprang about  in an old sugar box at her feet. Young tom laughed loud at her exclamation. “they  cairn’t feel,” he sniggered. Anna wondered that a mouth so soft and kind could utter  such heartless words.  in an hour the united efforts of the party had caught nine mackerel; it was not  a multitude, but the sun, in perfecting the weather, had spoilt the sport. Anna had  ceased to commiserate the captured fish. she was obliged, however, to avert her head  when tom cut some skin from the side of one of the mackerel to provide fresh bait;  this device seemed to her the extremest refinement of cruelty. (Bennet, 1902, pp.  199–200) such a stark difference of moral opinion is not unusual among discussions concerning  fish. in terms of pain, fish are arguably the source of the greatest moral inconsistency and  confusion in the world.

Exactly what the term fish means is contestable. fish is often used in the  vernacular as an all-encompassing word for a diverse group of animals, each of whom  hold a very different taxonomic status. there is what i call a problem of definitional  scope with the term fish that is very hard to escape. the lack of specificity inherent  in the term virtually ensures that any meaningful statement about fish may easily be  deemed inaccurate by the sheer likelihood of an individual species exception.4 for  example, the difference in organic makeup between osteichthyes (bony fish) and chon- drichthyes (cartilaginous fish) is immense; it is hard to find a meaningful statement  about one that could be fairly applied to the other. similarly, the possibility of varying  shades of sentience within and among marine vertebrates and invertebrates5 further  complicates the discussion.  According to fishBase, the largest and most extensively accessed online database on  fish, 32,100 species of fish have been listed as of september 2011, which is more than  the combined total of all other vertebrates: mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds  (froese &amp; Pauly, 2012). Despite the range and complexity of the definitional scope prob- lem, a working definition of fish from Webster’s New World Dictionary of the American  Language (1984) is “any of a large group of cold-blooded vertebrate animals living in  water, and having permanent gills for breathing, fins, and, usually, scales” (p. 527).  Even so, this functional definition is not without flaws. first, the definition excludes  arguably the most sentient of sea life: cephalopods such as squid and octopuses. see,  for example, mather (1995); mather (2008); moynihan (1985); and hastein, scarfe, and  lund (2005). second, even this limited definition still represents an extremely diverse  group of animals with variations in biology, cognition, and sentience.  the definitional scope problem highlights an underlying bias in our nonhuman  lexicon; the term fish groups a plethora of unique species into one erroneously ho- mogenous classification. the way in which our language is constructed to discuss fish  JAnE 4_2 text.indd   17 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 18 Journal of Animal Ethics, 4 (2014) inherently limits the discussion to a group of species instead of distinctive individuals,  all of whom are different in one way or another. it is also important to note that only  a relatively small number of fish species, often those of economic importance to the  fishing and aquaculture industries, have been studied in any serious scientific detail.  therefore, even this article is necessarily limited in its generalizations of sentience  across the range of species of fish. PAin vErsus suFFEring the fish pain debate stems from an important distinction between pain and suffering.  Despite the fact that the words are often used interchangeably, there is a fundamental  difference between the two. the international Association for the study of Pain defines  pain as a conscious experience with two parts: a sensory element and an element of  emotional feeling or suffering (merskey &amp; Bogduk, 1994). the heart of the fish pain  debate lies in the differences between these two elements of pain: the sensory and  the emotional.  in our everyday experience of being hurt, there is first an unconscious phase in which  the nervous system responds to a noxious stimulus; this is called nociception. for example,  when one’s hand is burned, the body reacts unconsciously by immediately withdrawing  the hand. nociceptors under the skin are responsible for this sensory response to pain.  however, it is only very soon thereafter that one becomes conscious of the burn and  suffers from it, altering behavior to prevent further pain and damage. the conscious  feeling of suffering is additional to the unconscious sensory response to pain. strictly  speaking, nociception is not pain; it would be a categorical mistake to equate the two.  nociception is necessary, but not sufficient, for pain and suffering. suffering is only felt  when nociception is raised to the level of consciousness.  thus, the real question the fish pain debate poses is whether fish can suffer. in other  words, is unconscious nociception raised to a level of consciousness in fish? for fish to  suffer they must not only have the physical mechanisms that respond to pain (nocicep- tors), but they also must consciously internalize such responses. Broom (1998) explains  that: the pain system of fish is very similar to that of birds and mammals. fish have pain  receptor cells, nociceptive neuronal pathways, specialized transmitter substances, elec- trophysiological responses to cuts, bruises and electric shocks, behavioral avoidance,  learned avoidance of places where they had unpleasant experiences and processing  systems in the brain which parallel those in birds and mammals. hence at least some  aspects of pain as we know it must be felt by fish. (Proceedings)  Broom describes the sensory aspects of fish physiology and behavioral responses,  but this is only half of the equation. the debate is not primarily about whether fish have  nociceptive neuronal pathways, but whether fish are consciously aware of the nociception  and, therefore, have the capacity to suffer. Without consciousness, there cannot be pain  in the full two-part sense of the term; there can only be nociception.

Animal consciousness cannot be directly measured, so animal welfare  scientists must look for certain anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence in order  to indicate sentience and suffering. many studies have searched for these indicators of  consciousness in fish, some of which will be discussed. the following discussion, however,  is by no means exhaustive.  the use of mental representations is highly suggestive of access consciousness, which  may be found in studies using fish. Aronson (1951) studied a species of fish called frillfin  goby. these fish live in rock pools found in low-tide areas and have developed an ingenious  way of avoiding predation and escaping a rapidly evaporating tide pool; they generate  spatial representations of their environment during high tide and utilize these mental  maps to plan the most effective escape route when the tide goes down and the gobies find  themselves vulnerable in a tidal pool. the ability to mentally map out one’s surroundings  and act in accordance with such a map is characteristic of access consciousness.  male cichlid fish also show signs of access consciousness, as they can infer social  rank by observation alone. in one study, male cichlids were placed in a glass tank and  forced to watch a series of fights in which fish A beats B, B beats c, c beats D, and D  beats E. We know, therefore, that in a fight between fish A and fish E, A would probably  win. We know this through a logical property called transitive inference: We understand  the social hierarchy and extrapolate it to individuals within the hierarchy. surprisingly  enough, cichlids can do the same thing: When the bystander fish is put into a tank with  two other fish, he immediately attacks the fish lower on the hierarchy even when he has  never seen the two individual fish fight each other. for example, when the bystander  is thrown into a tank with fish B and fish D, both of whom have lost and won an equal  number of fights, and though the bystander has never witnessed them fight each other,  he knows that B is the “stronger” fish and therefore the one to avoid (Grosenick, clem- ent, &amp; fernald, 2007).  Grosenick et al.’s (2007) research shows that fish use logical inferences to direct their  decisions. Amazingly, the use of logical inference found in cichlids is considered to be  a developmental milestone not found in humans until about four years of age (Piaget,  1928). these findings demonstrate that fish develop concepts and representations of the  physical and social features of their surroundings and use them to guide behavior. thus,  there is evidence that fish exhibit signs of access consciousness. JAnE 4_2 text.indd   19 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> 20 Journal of Animal Ethics, 4 (2014)  Phenomenal consciousness is more difficult to discern in fish. it would be just as hard  to detect in humans if we did not share a common language. however, Braithwaite’s  (2010) study on rainbow trout, a model teleost, is convincing; trout seem to adjust their  choices based on the context of their situation. the study also found the presence of  nociceptors in trout, which were activated when exposed to a noxious stimulus. many  similar studies show that rainbow trout have nociceptors in the head, lips, and oper- cular6 area (sneddon, 2002; sneddon &amp; Gentle, 2002). the nocipetors found in fish  are physiologically identical to those found in mammals (sneddon, 2003). oliveira et  al. (2001) found that male chichlid fish have surges of hormones while watching fish  fight, which is further evidence that fish behavior is often adjusted to a given social  context. A plethora of these studies exist, providing evidence for this difficult aspect  of consciousness in fish.  there is also good evidence of self-consciousness in fish. self-consciousness is the  experience of thinking about one’s own actions, contemplating potential scenarios in one’s  head, and then acting in accordance with which scenario one deems best.  fish are “steeped in social intelligence, pursuing machiavellian strategies of manipula- tion, punishment and reconciliation, exhibiting stable cultural traditions, and co-operating  to inspect predators and catch food,” none of which seem possible without a sense of  self-consciousness (laland, Brown, &amp; Krause, 2003, p. 199). there is a surprising amount  of evidence supporting complex social interactions among fish, providing evidence for  self-consciousness.  for example, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and its “client”  reef fish show interspecific sociopositive behavior, which is generally characteristic of  mammals and primates in particular (Bshary &amp; Wurth, 2001). the bluestreak cleaner  wrasse is one of many species of cleaner wrasse inhabiting coral reefs in the indian and  Pacific oceans who eat parasites and dead tissue off of a “client” or “host” fish (côté,  2000). interestingly enough, the cleaner wrasse often touches dorsal fin areas of its “cli- ent” fish in a way that is not compatible with the removal of parasites. it is believed that  “the cleaners use tactile simulation in order to successfully (i) alter client decisions over  how long to stay for an inspection, and (ii) stop clients from fleeing or aggressive chasing  of the cleaner in response to a cleaner fish bite that made them jolt” (Bshary &amp; Wurth,  2001, p. 1495). thus, there appears to be evidence of interspecific social strategies that  necessitate a form of self-consciousness in fish, as such behavior would be impossible  unless both the cleaner and the client understood the implications of their own actions.  Another good example of symbiotic cooperation between different species is found  in the relationship between the grouper and the eel. Both fish live in water around coral  reefs and both have competitive advantages in hunting for prey. the eel can get into  the holes and crevasses of coral that the grouper cannot, and the grouper is bigger and  faster than the eel. these fish have figured out a way to communicate and cooperate to  maximize their efficiency in catching prey. When a grouper chases a fish into a coral reef,  he swims over to signal an eel. the eel then either ignores the grouper’s signal, or he  leaves his hole to help hunt. sometimes the eel chases the prey directly into the mouth  JAnE 4_2 text.indd   20 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="6">  Elder, Fish Pain 21 of the grouper, and sometimes the eel catches the fish for himself. importantly, feeding  efficiency for both species is measurably higher when they hunt cooperatively than when  they hunt independently (Bshary, hohner, Ait-el-Djoudi, &amp; fricke, 2006).  this example of fish cooperating with each other through the communication of their  intentions is a highly complex cognitive ability. there are very few other instances of co- operative hunting between any animals, terrestrial or not. Braithwaite (2010) argues that  this symbiotic relationship seems like a possible instance of self-consciousness. there are  many more instances of cooperative behavior in the fish world: for example, egg trading  and reciprocity in simultaneously hermaphroditic fish, nest raiding, mobbing behavior,  and predator inspection (Dugatkin, 1997). to those who are unconvinced, rollin (1989)  asks: “Why not simply take the fact that animals perceive or are able to recognize dangers  and threats to themselves as evidence of self-awareness?” (p. 263).  considering the evidence aforementioned, it seems safe to say that “anatomical,  pharmacological and behavioural data suggest that affective states of pain, fear and stress  are likely to be experienced by fish in similar ways as in tetrapods [amphibians, reptiles,  birds, and mammals]” (chandroo, Duncan, &amp; moccia, 2004a). however, there are many  objections to such a claim, some of which will now be discussed. oBJEctions considErEd the proposal to expand our moral horizon to include fish faces many objections, all of  which tend to be embedded in either a flawed biological picture or an anthropocentric  view of the world. most of the objections to fish pain can be reduced to two fundamental  problems, both of which will be addressed.  the first objection to fish consciousness, and therefore fish pain, is derived from biol- ogy: rose (2002) argues that pain and consciousness in humans depend on very specific  brain regions, namely specialized neocortical regions of the cerebral hemispheres, that  are not found in fish (or any other animal except primates). rose is not the first, or the  only, scientist to argue that fish lack sentience due to differences in brain structure (la- chat, 1996). the neocortical region, “which in humans is an important part of the neural  mechanism that generates the subjective experience of suffering, is lacking in fish and  non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued that its absence in fish indicates that  fish cannot suffer” (huntingford et al., 2006, p. 1). if this biological picture is correct, it  should be noted that every non-mammalian animal would be incapable of suffering.  there is good evidence that fish do feel pain, despite the fact that they lack a neo- cortex. first, mri studies show that when humans feel pain, the neocortex does indeed  activate, but many other parts of the brain also activate. the other active areas are located  beneath the neocortex, and are also found in fish brains (Braithwaite, 2010). it is still  unclear whether human pain is solely a function of the neocortex or if it can even be  restricted to any single area in the brain (chandroo, Yue, &amp; moccia, 2004b).  second, when brains evolve to develop structures such as the neocortex, the “newer”  parts of the brain often take over roles that were otherwise fulfilled by older structures.  JAnE 4_2 text.indd   21 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 22 Journal of Animal Ethics, 4 (2014) the role the neocortex plays in humans could possibly be fulfilled by other regions in  “older” brains, as it is evolutionarily “new” in ours (Braithwaite, 2010). the suggestion  that a brain function can suddenly arise ex nihilo without a primitive ancestor defies the  laws of evolution.  third, the neocortex is critical in the human ability to lateralize information, such as  sensory information like vision, between the two hemispheres in the brain. using rose’s  (2002) logic, just as fish allegedly cannot feel pain because they lack a neocortex, fish  should be unable to lateralize information, including visual information, between the two  hemispheres of their brains. however, scientists have discovered that many species of fish  do indeed lateralize information, including visual information (sovrano, Bisazza, &amp; Val- lortigara, 2001; Bisazza, rogers, &amp; Vallortigara, 1998; cantalupo, Bisazza, &amp; Vallortigara,  1995). there is scientific consensus that fish lateralize information, and there is universal  consensus that fish can see. thus, rose’s logic does not hold up against thoughtful scrutiny;  there is evidence suggesting that fish have some cognitive abilities that are found in the  neocortical region in the human brain, despite the fact that they lack a neocortex.7 fish  consciousness cannot be as easily dismissed as some biologists think.  rollin (1989) explains the second main objection to fish pain: to “worry about animal  pain is misplaced anthropomorphism, for in circumstances in which humans would be  screaming and writhing, many animals show very few signs of extreme pain” (p. 145).  When humans assess pain in other beings, including other humans, we tend to rely on an  argument by analogy: if the other being responds to a noxious stimulus in an analogous  way to how we would respond, we assume that the experience is similar to ours. this argu- ment is a double-edged sword; if the other being does not respond to a noxious stimulus  in an analogous way, we assume that their experience is dissimilar to ours. since fish do  not express pain in an analogous way to humans, we assume fish cannot feel pain.8  there are at least two problems with this objection to fish pain. first, animals signal  pain in a variety of ways, some of which do not correspond to the ways in which humans  express pain. A prominent veterinary anesthesiologist, lawrence soma, has pointed out  that there are “anatomical or other biological explanations . . . in all cases in which ani- mals do not appear to hurt when we would, without having to resort to the notion that  animals don’t feel pain” (as cited in rollin, 1989, p. 135). there are certainly physiological  differences between humans and other animals, and animals express the feeling of pain  differently than humans due to such differences.  second, judgments based on these analogies are inherently anthropocentric; the  analogy is built upon assessments of pain derived from human experience. in other  words, the deck is stacked against nonhuman animals. humanity arbitrarily becomes  the yardstick by which one measures the emotional states of other animals, inevitably  setting those animals up for failure. “man as the measure of all things” is symptomatic  of an extremely ubiquitous prejudice in human thought: “that Homo Sapiens is the pin- nacle of life—that we are the pot of gold at the end of evolution’s rainbow” (Balcombe,  2010, p. 164). nonhuman animals, fish included, do indeed show unique pain behavior.  the fact that animal behavior happens to be different than human behavior does not  delegitimize their pain. JAnE 4_2 text.indd   22 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="8">  Elder, Fish Pain 23 Why thEsE ArgumEnts Flourish it is somewhat astonishing that these objections pull so strongly on humanity’s moral  compass—fish are treated in a way that would be considered horrific, even illegal, when  applied to other animals. understanding why these arguments thrive will provide a way of  combating such pervasive speciesism.9 there are many reasons why the aforementioned  objections carry such weight today, but two warrant special attention.  first, the use of fish is often culturally validated. When one’s identity is tied up with  angling, fishing commercially, or even cooking fish, it is very difficult to simply wake up  one day and change. this is especially true when children grow up on the coast and are  conditioned to see cruelty to fish as an unquestioned aspect of life by the sea. often,  this conditioning makes people blind to the cruel acts occurring in plain sight and can  easily amount to an imprisonment so total that the prisoners do not even know they are  locked up. it is all too easy to make the fallacious move from seeing a cultural practice  go unquestioned to believing that it is unquestionable.  in these communities, fishing is often the foundation of one’s livelihood; to question  the morality of the treatment of fish would be to question the very cornerstone of one’s  society. similarly, when one’s family comes from a culture that prides itself on cooking  and eating fish, to question such cultural practices is the equivalent of calling into doubt  the history of the family. culturally validated norms are the hardest to transcend, since  the threat of being rejected by a society one loves is ever-present. the custom is possible  to escape, as, for example, with vegetarian children of omnivores; however, it usually  involves breaking free from the geographic, cultural, and/or social aspects of one’s past.  second, a more deeply ingrained reason as to why these arguments flourish can be  found in our neurophysiology. fish lack neotenous characteristics or, in other words,  “cuteness.” neoteny is an evolutionary process that involves genetic delay to the point  where adult species still maintain characteristics prominent in juveniles. the human spe- cies seems to have a hardwired attraction to neotenized faces. in a cross-cultural study  done by Jones (1995), female faces that were more neotenized were found to be more  attractive to men than less neotenized female faces. Another study found that Asian,  hispanic, and White female faces were found to be most attractive if they had neoten- ous characteristics such as large eyes, greater distance between eyes, and small noses  (cunningham, roberts, Barbee, Druen, &amp; Wu, 1995).  But what does the human attraction to neotenous characteristics matter when it comes  to fish? humans respond more favorably with sympathy and protection when they are  exposed to neotenous faces. the human brain responds sympathetically when presented  with characteristics of cuteness, even when those characteristics are presented by a dif- ferent species.  this is best shown in Gould’s (1980) claim that, over the past 50 years, mickey mouse  has evolved to be more and more cute in order to make him more appealing to audiences.  his creators have added neotenous traits to mickey’s face, such as bigger eyes, shorter  limbs, and a smaller snout. When it comes to animal welfare in the united states, the  more neotenized an animal is, the more “endearing” and “charming” it is considered to  JAnE 4_2 text.indd   23 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> 24 Journal of Animal Ethics, 4 (2014) appear and, therefore, greater moral significance is attributed to any abuse of that species  (lawrence, 1986). fish lack the cuteness that is evolutionarily important when it comes  to human’s instinctive desire to protect any animal. our biology is arguably the hardest  limitation to rise above when it comes to the moral worth of fish.  this list is by no means exhaustive, but it exposes serious cultural and biological bar- riers to fish welfare that lack any rational justification. the only way to break free from  such moral shortcomings is to expose oneself to the irrationality and flaws in the objec- tions and alter one’s behavior accordingly. hopefully, this list is a catalyst for introspection  and potential change. however, even if one is not fully convinced, there is still a sound  argument for fish welfare. thE PrEcAutionAry PrinciPlE current research tips the scale toward consciousness in fish, and, since they have noci- ceptors as well, toward suffering in fish. unfortunately, there still are many unknowns (as  there are with many other animal species). more information needs to be gathered and  more studies need to be done. the current evidence may not provide an answer to the  fish pain debate, but there certainly are enough complexities to require a reevaluation  of the treatment of fish in the status quo. When one is faced with uncertainty, especially  in a case that involves the killing of animals, the precautionary principle is the moral  approach one ought to adopt.  the precautionary principle helps one decide how to act in the face of many unknowns.  it states that, where there is no conclusive consensus, the burden of proof that an action  is not harmful falls on the person who is acting. therefore, if one does not find enough  validity in the evidence for sentiency in fish, it does not necessarily follow that one has a  blank check for exploitation and slaughter. instead, the precautionary principle dictates  that one suspends action that may be potentially harmful until it has been proven harm- less. the precautionary principle ensures that the least amount of suffering is inflicted  due to the shortcomings of scientific consensus or uncertainty.  the marine mammal Protection Act (mmPA) of 1972 is an example par excellence  of the implementation of the precautionary principle in animal welfare. the act prohibits  the taking of any marine mammal, and defines take as “to harass, hunt, capture, or kill,  or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal” (1972, p. 6). the mmPA  then defines the term harassment as “any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i)  has the potential [emphasis added] to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock  in the world; or (ii) has the potential [emphasis added] to disturb a marine mammal or  marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns” (1972,  p. 7). therefore, any action which simply has the potential to harm, perturb, or even an- noy a marine mammal is legally banned in u.s. waters. the mmPA is an example of the  precautionary principle working where aquatic human activities are concerned, albeit  aquatic mammals as opposed to fish. similarly, British animal welfare law started legally  protecting all cephalopods after January 1, 2013. such protection is another example of  JAnE 4_2 text.indd   24 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="10">  Elder, Fish Pain 25 scientific evidence leading to legislative change via the precautionary principle. likewise,  the European union applies the precautionary principle as a statutory requirement in  many legal arenas (recuerda, 2006).  the fish pain debate uniquely warrants the precautionary principle due to the large  amount of suffering that humans potentially inflict on fish. A report entitled “Worse things  happen at sea, the Welfare of Wild-caught fish” presents probably the first-ever systematic  estimate of the number of free living fish caught globally every year (mood &amp; Brooke, 2010).  mood and Brooke (2010) calculate that the number of free-living fish is in the order of one  trillion, and could be as high as 2.7 trillion. this figure does not include fish killed illegally,  recreationally, on a farm, or as bycatch.10 mood (2012) has recently published an estimate  of the number of farmed fish slaughtered for food in 2010 to be between 37 and 12011 bil- lion individuals (for which the midpoint is around 80 billion). these numbers show that the  annual number of fish slaughtered globally probably exceeds all other farmed vertebrates.  therefore, the fish pain debate is one that must be taken seriously. the precautionary  principle will minimize the potential suffering that humans may be inflicting. conclusion teleost fish have nociceptors that indicate the ability to sense pain. the more controversial  claim is that fish can suffer due to the evidence that they have some, if not all, forms of  consciousness. Whether they also suffer may be an area of debate, but it should not be  the principle underlying a decision. if one believes that animal welfare principles demand  consideration of potential harm to animals on their own terms in the course of human  action, then even the potential for pain in fish should be enough to prevent killing and/or  consuming fish. the scientific debate is not definitive, but it at least shows that the view  of fish as automata is too simplistic. As a result, the precautionary principle is the moral  ethic one ought to adopt in the face of uncertainty. this means the burden of proof that  an action is not harmful falls on the person who is acting.  the implications of acknowledging fish pain are vast. As Braithwaite (2010) argues,  there is no logical reason why we should not extend the same welfare considerations to  fish as we do to birds and mammals: “We wouldn’t accept killing chickens by throwing  them into a tank of water and waiting for them to drown, so why don’t we object to fish  suffocating on trawler decks?” (p. 18). the welfare considerations are immense and will  only be briefly mentioned here. first, it seems as though moral pescetarianism is not a  defendable diet. A moral pescetarian is a vegetarian for moral reasons yet still eats fish.  fish seem to have interests just like mammals and birds do, and, therefore, not eating  animals while continuing to eat fish has a tenuous moral foundation. second, sport and  recreational fishing must be seen as an unnecessary infliction of suffering. catch-and- release angling, which is generally considered the most “humane” form of fishing, still  results in stress, injury, and pain (cooke &amp; sneddon, 2007). commercial fishing must  also be scrutinized, especially the indiscriminate trolling and long lining that is widely  used in modern fishing boats; not only are fish often stuck on the lines for up to ten hours  JAnE 4_2 text.indd   25 8/19/14   10:25 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> 26 Journal of Animal Ethics, 4 (2014) until they are hauled in, but thousands of sea birds have died this way and four species  of albatross are dangerously close to extinction because of it (Braithwaite, 2010). finally,  the popular conception of fish as swimming protein must be replaced with the view that  fish have complex mental and social lives, with interests to avoid pain similar to other  animals. clearly, a serious discussion of the human-fish relationship is long overdue. it  is high time for fish to be included in humanity’s moral horizon.

Notes  1. concentrated Animal feeding operation (cAfo) is a legal term first created by the united  states’ Environmental Protection Agency to describe animal agriculture operations that confine  animals for more than 45 days during a growing season in an area that does not produce vegeta- tion and meets certain size thresholds. the Environmental Protection Agency monitors cAfos’  pollution profiles to limit environmental degradation.  2. this is best seen in the fish farming industry, where plant terms are often applied to fish.  for example, a cage full of fish is often referred to as a crop, and the slaughter process is often  referred to as a harvest. such inappropriate linguistic usage is a manifestation of the farm’s view  that fish are objects rather than individual sentient beings (Broom, 2007, 103–104).  3. the preferred term here would be nonhuman animals, however, animals will be used in  this article for short.  4. the linguistically constructed limitation imposed on the discussion of fish is similar to the  limitations imposed on terms like “pet” and Africa, both of which are much too broad in scope  to allow meaningful space for discussion.  5. see Wallace (2005) for a thought-provoking analysis of sentience in an invertebrate crus- tacean: the lobster.  6. the operculum of a teleost is the bony flap protecting its gills, generally marking the divi- sion between the head and the body.  7. Birds also lack a neocortex and instead have a paleocortex that performs functions executed  by the mammalian neocortex. Birds are similar to fish in that they lack a neocortex and yet can  lateralize information.  8. People for the Ethical treatment of Animals attempted to remedy such anthropocentrism by  running an ad entitled “silent scream” in which they argued that, although fish screams cannot  be heard, fish pain is just as real as human pain. similarly, the world would look at commercial  fishing in a radically different light if only fish could scream. instead, there are no humane  slaughter regulations for fish caught and killed silently at sea and very few for farmed fish.  9. Speciesism is a term coined by British psychologist richard ryder. ryder writes: “in as  much as both ‘race’ and ‘species’ are vague terms used in the classification of living creatures  according, largely, to physical appearance, an analogy can be made between them. Discrimina- tion on grounds of race, although most universally condoned two centuries ago, is now widely  condemned. similarly, it may come to pass that enlightened minds may one day abhor ‘speciesism’  as much as they now detest ‘racism.’” (1971, 81)  10. Bycatch is the term used to describe fish and other species caught incidentally in the  pursuit of the “target” species (e.g., turtles and juvenile fish in shrimp nets).
