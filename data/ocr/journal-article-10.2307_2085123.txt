<plain_text><page sequence="1">VEBLEN'S STUDY OF MODERN GERMANY ARTHUR K. DAVIS Harvard University IT is an interesting paradox that the lesser aspects of Thorstein Veblen's work have contributed most to his popular repu- tation, while some of his best writings have gone almost unnoticed. Indeed, Veblen is the subject of several paradoxes. Few other Americans have had as much influence on the social thought of their times. Yet he left no "school" to elaborate his point of view.' Veblen's first full-length work, The Theory of the Leisure Class (I899), established him before the public as a satirist. Subsequent opinion has either extravagantly praised the book or roundly condemned it. Both views have been partisan rather than objective. The work is in fact a very keen and pioneer analysis of the latent sociological functions of consumption as symbols of social status in our competitive society. On the other hand, its exclusive concern with the invidious aspect of contemporary life entirely over- looks the cohesive function of consumption habits in expressing the basic values of the group.2 The decided limitations of Veblen's analytical system of social theory, his unde- niable antipathy toward his subject, and his unique literary style have combined to ob- scure the real sociological nature of this, his best known work. Veblen's most substantial achievement, however, is his Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (1915) and its sequel, The Nature of Peace and the Terms of Its Perpetuation (1917) . There he comes clos- est to transcending the inadequacies of his theoretical system, with a consequent insight into empirical problems that is nowhere keener. These studies have a current interest as well as a scientific one. Veblen's analysis of the social structure of modern Germany and the possible relations between Germany and the other Powers is still worth reading. Despite his great errors and greater omis- sions, he grasped the essentials of several leading issues.4 Veblen's explicit sociological theory was set forth in his earlier works in terms of habits and instincts. The instincts he em- ployed were the instinct of workmanship, the parental bent, and idle curiosity, all of which he portrayed as uniformly benevolent. In prehistoric cultures, according to Veblen, they defined the goals of human activity. Habits gradually evolved as the means to those ends. But, being cumulative and rigidi- fying, the habits eventually gained enough autonomy to submerge the instincts and to take over their function of formulating the goals and general constellation of group ac- tion. The more persistent habits Veblen called institutions. He conceived of them as uniformly predatory. Although habit and instinct were defined originally by Veblen in biological and re- flexive terms, they both contained important value elements as actually used. Veblen never broadened his theoretical system to include these normative elements. The clash between his explicit biological orientation and his im- 1Veblen was the unrecognized progenitor of the culture-lag school in American sociology. He was a prime influence on the institutional movement in American economics, although no institutionalist has ever been a disciple of Veblen. His impress on social ethics and policy has been felt in such widely dif- ferent movements as Technocracy and certain as- pects of the New Deal, neither of which was Veb- len's brain-child in any immediate sense. 2 Cf. A. K. Davis, "Veblen on the Decline of the Protestant Ethic," Social Forces, vol. 22, March I944. 8His other major works are: The Theory of Business Enterprise, N.Y., I904, second in popu- larity only to the Theory of the Leisure Class; The Instinct of Workmanship, N.Y., I914, which with certain essays in The Place of Science in Mod- ern Civilization, N.Y., igig, contains most of his economic and social evolutionary theory; and Ab- sentee Ownership, N.Y., I923, an elaboration of earlier ideas, more outspoken, but not new.

But in his studies of the leisure class and modern Germany the under- lying substance of his thought shows to best advantage. The gain centers about Veblen's concept of institutions. He employed the concept there, not in the sense of mere habit, but as a meaningfully integrated value pat- tern "defining the situation" for the group. Two other important criticisms of his gen- eral theoretical and philosophical position will appear later. They concern Veblen's evolutionary view of history, with its corol- lary of culture-lag, and his vein of Utopian anarchism. The effects of these preconcep- tions on his sociological theory were limiting in the extreme, for they prevented any con- sideration of a social system as a function- ing whole. Veblen began his study of Germany by outlining two types of societies, the Dynastic State and the Constitutional State. Examples of the former were Germany and Japan; of the latter, England and America. Veblen's at- tention centered on Germany and England. The Dynastic State, according to Veblen, is authoritarian. Its supreme policy is extend- ing the power and glory of the dynasty. Ex- ternally this issues in aggression; internally, in centalization. Veblen argued that coercion is not the mainspring of the Dynastic State, as an American observer might assume. In- stead, its intense patriotism is part of a com- mon value pattern furnishing positive co- hesion to the German state. Such coercion as exists is a symptom thereof rather than the essence. Unlike many political scientists of his day, Veblen looked beneath the external forms of government structures. Veblen's Constitutional State is a democ- racy or a commonwealth. He often called its government a "committee for the business man," functioning mainly to further business interests.5 The population has more rights, or immunities from government interference, than does a Dynastic people. The philosophy of the masses leans toward that of "Live and let live." Such nations, he wrote, fight main- ly on provocation, whereas Dynastic States much more frequently use war as an instru- ment of policy.6 The substance of Veblen's work on modem Germany-the period of the First Reich- turns on two major complexes of elements: (i) the new machine technology; (2) the old scheme of "use and wont," or custom. Elsewhere he describes technology as the dynamic agent in social change. Normally it undermines the established institutions of a society. It operates in terms of mechanical, objective cause and effect, whereas institu- tions are inherited conventions defining what is right and good. Veblen considered the lat- ter as anthropomorphic, personal, the oppo- site of the blind mechanism of modern tech- nology. The influence of the machine process gradually leads men to judge everything by cold efficiency. Technology in England and America has made for a skepticism and even a semirepudiation of the traditional laissez- faire state, private property, the family, re- ligion, and other institutions. But in Germany, according to Veblen, the institutional system still dominates tech- nology. This is because of the relative new- ness of industrialism, and the unique and rugged nature of the institutional pattern, the essence of which is feudalistic. Authority is monopolized by a semi-feudal class per- vaded by a warlike animus. Despite the re- cent modifications of this late-medieval pat- tern, the feudal "habit of mind" has per- sisted.8 Veblen's main thesis is that the machine process, borrowed readymade from England, ' The Theory of Business Enterprise, N.Y., I904, ch. 8, especially p. 269; Absentee Ownership, N.Y., I923, ch. 2; The Vested Interests, N.Y., i9oi, ch. 6. *The most detailed study on the frequency of wars among modern nations is by Sorokin, Social and Cultural Dynamics, N.Y., I937, vol. 3, part 2. His conclusions are somewhat different. Veblen fails to qualify his statement with respect to temporal variations. TVeblen, The Theory of Business Enterprise, ch. 8. 8 "In later times (after the neolithic period) people came to deal with aliens in the way of raid- ing. . . . Out of these predatory beginnings, legiti- mized by use and wont, presently came the Dynastic State. . . . There the community has grown to feel itself at one with its masters." Veblen, Imperial Germany, p. i67.</page><page sequence="3">VEBLEN'S STUDY OF MODERN GERMANY 605 came so recently to Germany that it was merely harnessed to the existing Dynastic order. Its slow working, anti-institutional effects have had no time to undermine the predatory bent inherited from the feudal mentality. The reason for the persistence of German's feudal outlook Veblen gave as her 2000 years of warlike experience." While there is doubt- less some validity in that point of view, it does not warrant the exclusive emphasis Veblen places on it. He went on, however, to put his finger on one of the central moral premises of German social structure. Its crux was the "concept of duty." The highest virtue was loyalty, obe- dience to authority. This fitted admirably into the Dynastic order of affairs. Another aspect pointed out by Veblen was the pe- culiar German concept of the State, accord- ing to which sovereignty resides neither in the people nor in the ruler, but in the half mystical, super-organic, moral community called the State. The ruler personifies the State.10 Veblen indicated that the practical outcome of all this was apparently plain authoritarianism. But he took pains to em- phasize the underlying meanings which the Germans attached to their authoritarian be- havior. He demonstrated the impossibility of taking pure coercion as the essential cohesive factor in German social organization. Although Veblen discussed these matters in terms of habits, what he did in effect was to outline an institutional pattern which constitutes an important section of the Ger- man common value structure. The main ele- ments in Veblen's picture were the semi- mystical conception of the State, the exten- sion of its power and glory as the highest aims of its citizens, their intense loyalty to duty as the means of realizing those aims, and the minimizing of individual interests in favor of those of the State. He almost arrived at the new conception of institutions now de- veloping in sociology, which sees the com- mon-value or institutional element as the fundamental integrating factor in a society. These values, when meaningfully integrated, define for a group the normative ends and means of social action; its ethical and re- ligious orientation, its general Weltanschau- ung, its system of authority and stratifica- tion; in brief, its scale of moral values.'1 This is the direction in which Veblen's "con- cept of duty" and his whole treatment of Germany were pointing. Having shown the aggressive tendencies in the German common value constellation, Veblen turned his attention to the similar tendencies deriving from modem capitalism. His ideas, which have an indirect Marxian affinity, dealt with the inherently expanding needs of capitalism for markets, investment channels, and raw materials. German capi- talism developed mostly after i860.12 By then other Powers had seized the cream of colonial resources, and were beginning to stake off their own home markets with tariff barriers. German capitalism was thus increas- ingly impelled to more highly rationalized techniques, and ultimately to non-competi- tive methods. Interestingly enough, Veblen never attempted to make capitalism the ma- jor source of German militancy. His works as a whole show capitalism as a dynamic ele- ment wherever it has developed. In Germany it merely reinforced a current already flowing in the same direction. More self-consciously than many other States, Germany viewed the new commerce and industry as means of strengthening the empire.'3 Veblen held that the union of predatory, even fanatical, institutional values 'On "Germany the battlefield of Europe," see S. B. Fay, Rise of Brandenburg-Prussia, N.Y., I937; MUller-Frienfels, Psychologie des deutschen Mensch- en, Munich, I930, pp. 29-30; Rosinski, The Ger- man Army, London, I939; and many others. The idea is a common one. tVeblen, Imperial Germany, pp. 154, i60-i62. His interpretation seems fairly true. Cf. Gooch, Theories of the State, London, 19I5. Cf. in particular the works of Comte, Durk- heim, Sorokin, and Max Weber. ' Veblen's authority here was Sombart, Die deutsche Volkswirtschaft im neunzehnten Jahrhun- dert, Berlin, I903. 1 Veblen was not alone in this view.

This citation is typical of many studies of German economic history.</page><page sequence="4">6o6 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW with modern industrial technology made Germany a grave menace. But he considered this combination inherently unstable. The machine process, according to his theory of social change, tends to wear down Germany's archaic institutional pattern." He envisaged two possible solutions of this dilemma. First, the Germans "may yet be able to retreat into that more archaic phase of Western civilization, out of which they have been escaping, by recourse to so drastic a reaction in their institutions as will offset and dispel the effects wrought by habituation to modern industry and the exact sciences."'15 Second, the old dynastic pattern might be transformed to a Constitutional State char- acterized by capitalism and "free institu- tions." In that event the supremacy of busi- ness enterprise would itself be only a pass- ing phase, for in an earlier work Veblen had concluded that late-modern capitalism faces a similar dilemma. It can be succeeded either by a reversion to a military, predatory re- gime or by continued progress toward the supremacy of the machine process and an even greater freedom.'16 At this point two fundamental criticisms are in order. Veblen's "drift toward free in- stitutions" implies a society without insti- tutions. It is his unmistakable teaching that modern technology and science are incom- patible not only with the Dynastic State and capitalism, but with all existing institutions in general. The three benevolent Veblenian "instincts" which would emerge as the de- cisive elements in action after the demise of current predatory institutions are wholly in- adequate as substitute institutional struc- tures, despite their implicit normative con- tent.'7 The problem of order in Veblen's fu- ture machine age therefore becomes exceed- ingly acute. On the institutional or integrated value patterns depends the very possibility of social order, organization, and stability. A society without institutions is inconceivable. There is clearly a latent strain of naive philosophical anarchism in Veblen's thought. It crops out again in the section of his work dealing with England. The second basic criticism concerns Veb- len's evolutionary conception of history and his idea of culture lag. In his Instinct of Workmanship, he divided Western history into a series of vague cultural stages accord- ing to the degree and type of predatory pat- terns dominating each, and he clearly implied that institutions are not only predatory but obsolete. For example, the modern ideas of property and natural rights are the heritage of the eighteenth-century handicraft era. Military and religious institutions are sur- vivals from still earlier cultural stages, ac- cording to Veblen.'8 In this light the present age is witnessing the gradual emancipation of men from predatory institutions through the dissolving effects of the machine process, thus clearing the way for the unhampered sway of men's benevolent instinct, sub- merged by predation since prehistoric times. Veblen was sufficiently realistic to reserve the possibility of a reversal of this process. No small credit is due him for this, because most of his Anglo-Saxon contemporaries were still under the influence of the optimistic Victori- 14 "[The effect of the machine discipline shows itself] on the institutional side in a nearly univer- sal repudiation of all personal discrimination and prerogative, and shows itself on the side of knowl- edge in an impersonal mechanical conception of things and events. Its practical working out is the machine technology, of which the intellectual coun- terpart is the exact sciences. . . . Associated with this is the modern drift toward free institutions."

"T instinct of workmanship seems best inter- preted as a combination of two normative elements; high material productivity, and doing a job well for its own sake. The parental bent is a vague humani- tarianism. Idle curiosity should be interpreted as knowledge for its own sake. The predatory bent is not an instinct at all, but a phenomenon in the habit category. Veblen used no other instincts in his work. Although he defined them in biological reflexive terms, he obviously never meant them as such. Cf. A. K. Davis, "Sociological Elements in Veblen's Economic Thought."

But he had no real idea of institutional variation and com- parison. To Veblen, Germany was a sur- vival of an earlier phase of social organiza- tion, while England and America represented a later stage in an implicit progress toward Utopia. He could only consider Germany as backward instead of merely different."' So- cial scientists today agree that there is no single line of institutional development. A portion of Imperial Germany was de- voted to a comparative analysis of England, an example of a constitutional State, wherein capitalism was a dominant institution. Veb- len singled out England's relative geographi- cal isolation as the main cause of her modern industrial preeminence. Her island position partially shielded her from the extended ex- posure to continental feudalism and early- modern dynastic strife experienced by Ger- many. This is true enough, but the geograph- ic element was in no sense dominant in the development of modern England. It is pri- marily to the social factors that we must look.20 Geography was a highly important conditioning element, but analytically periph- eral to the situation. In England, according to Veblen, busi- ness enterprise and the machine technology matured more slowly than in Germany. The net result was a "drift toward free institu- tions." Veblen did not consider this an un- mitigated blessing. Business men focused on profit rather than on maximizing the quanti- ty and quality of goods, and the community's welfare suffered accordingly from high- pressure salesmanship, shoddy goods, en- forced idleness through capitalistic restric- tion of output, and failure to keep abreast of technological improvement.2' The other prominent development was the appearance of "conspicuous consumption," a standard of living directed, in Veblen's eyes, toward com- petitive display rather than physical well- being. Its chief manifestations were wasteful expenditure, exemption of the upper classes from industrial labor, an enormous increase in conventional necessities, and a preoccupa- tion with sports.22 Veblen concluded that these conditions reduced England's potential industrial efficiency, whereas in Germany their debilitating effects were minimized by the late development of industry there. Veblen's analysis of England was much less successful than his work on Germany. Granting the truth of much that he said about England (he could as well have said it of America) he failed to convey the sense of an institutional configuration specifically English. The basic fault lay in his assump- tion that England is following "the main line of Western development" toward a com- pletely free society, that is, one without in- stitutions. Since the Middle Age, when Eng- land and Germany according to Veblen were not greatly different, England has "lost" something,23 whereas Germany has retained the essence though not the forms of her archaic ways. "This discrepancy will have to be rated on the German side as an arrested spiritual development."n24 As for Veblen's ultimately negative picture of England, the answer is that English social organization includes a very definite value pattern, capa- ble of objective analysis as a functioning so- "9Veblen's frequent use of such words as archaic and survival in connection with Germany is clear evidence for this point.

This and the pre- ceding reference well illustrate Veblen's implicitly negative view of England and his attitude that Ger- many is backward. To repeat that both propositions are scientifically untenable is to labor the obvious. The point here is that they are the necessary re- sults of his evolutionary premise and his inade- quate conception of the analytical elements, par- ticularly the normative elements, in a social system,</page><page sequence="6">6o8 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW cial system, without regard to the problem of its origins or its place in a philosophy of history. We have seen how Veblen's study of Ger- many was based on the relationship between the new technology and the old scheme of use and wont. The core of the latter proto- institutional element was denoted by Veblen as the complex of attitudes centering about the Dynastic State, especially the concept of duty. From this combination, he reasoned, arose the truculent militancy of modern Ger- many, reinforced by certain tendencies in capitalism. The chief formative influences on Germany were set forth by Veblen as feudalism and war. We have already taken note of some of Veblen's major weaknesses; his sins of com- mission. Accuracy requires us to state that his omissions were even greater. It is impossi- ble to list here even a small portion of the elements in modern German social structure, much less to reconstruct their complicated interrelationships. Veblen gave insufficient attention to the role of philosophical ideas in formulating Germany's ideologies. He over- looked entirely the role of the Lutheran ethic, shown by Weber and Troeltsch to be highly significant. He could have been more specific on how feudal agrarian paternalism was car- ried over into industry and the Prussian State. It is unnecessary to extend the criti- cism further.25 It is relevant to remark briefly on Veb- len's ideas about a peace settlement for World War I. The argument of his Nature of Peace (19I7) was that the sources of wars are institutional. They are the universal habits of mind, patriotism and nationalism; values which are most intensely cultivated in the Dynastic States. Permanent peace may or may not be possible among Constitutional States, whose outlook approaches that of "Live and let live." But it is clearly im- possible with Germany and Japan. There, according to Veblen, nationalism has coa- lesced with feudal loyalty to create an ag- gressive, even fanatical, solidarity among all classes. He outlined two alternative methods for the other nations of the world to attain a stable peace. (i) They may submit to Ger- many. This way entails vassalage and a number of material benefits, but it is blocked by patriotism. (2) They may defeat the ag- gressors. The peace settlement must then compel the Dynastic peoples to unlearn their warlike habits and their blind allegiance. The greatest obstacle to peace, Veblen never tired of repeating, is the "spiritual animus" of the Dynastic State; not technological or econom- ic factors, but certain ideas held in common, having their greatest development in Ger- many and Japan. Veblen indicated further that a stable peace, under the second alter- native, would also require new ruling classes in Germany and England, and an interna- tional league including both victors and van- quished. His final condition of peace was the substitution of production for use in place of the profit system in all capitalistic nations. The prophetic quality of some of Veblen's observations is absolutely startling. Even be- fore 1917 Veblen was writing that the vin- dictive peace of reparations and territorial penalties which the Allies would probably impose would leave untouched the real foe, Germany's "spiritual animus." The Reich would be left nursing a patriotic grievance, and vengefully awaiting der Tag. He spe- cifically warned that a League which was merely a tool for enforcing such a settlement would eventually collapse. For final evidence of Veblen's brilliant insight, we need only point to his World War I estimate of Japan, then fighting on the Allied side. There was no Axis in I9I7. Yet in two short articles post- humously collected in Essays in Our Chang- ing Order (N.Y., I935) and by occasional references in Imperial Germany and the Na- ture of Peace, he indicated that his analysis of Germany was essentially applicable to Japan. In this paper Veblen's comparison of Ger- many and England and his work on the problem of peace have briefly been sur- 'Of course, Veblen did not write down in his book all he knew about Germany. The larger part of what he wrote was essential, though sketchily treated. But he left out much more that was also essential. His major failing was his conceptual scheme, which governed the selection of his ma- terial and organized its presentation.</page><page sequence="7">EXPECTATION OF LIFE AS AN INDEX OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 609 veyed. The chief contributions of his study have been noted and its principal theoretical and empirical shortcomings have been indi- cated. The primary theoretical significance is its tendency to transcend Veblen's instinc- tivist conceptual orientation and to give greater scope to normative institutional ele- ments. It points toward the broader and analytically more refined conceptual scheme which seems to be developing now in so- ciology.26 On the practical side, Veblen's work on Germany, in both its strong and weak points, shows the value of bringing to current social problems the understanding and insight afforded by a systematic scien- tific analysis of social phenomena. '"The trend referred to is an amorphous, many- sided one rather than a single coordinated line of development. One may mention among others the names of Durkheim, Sorokin, Pareto, Weber, and several English and American anthropologists, such as Malinowski, Firth, and Warner. Parsons' Struc- ture of Social Action, N.Y., I937, traces one aspect of this general evolution of social theory. The work now being done in the border area between so- ciology and analytic psychology seems highly promising in such writers as Alexander and Fromm. Of course the sharp contrasts within this group preclude any but the most general comparisons.</page></plain_text>
