Mbala, Tsaam, or Kwilu Pende? A Mother-and-Child Figure from the Kwango-Kwilu Region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo In his book Icons: Ideals and Power in the Art of Africa, Herbert Cole identified the image of the woman and child as one of five dominant "icons" in the visual arts of sub-Saharan Africa.1 Each of these icons re fers to a number of "root ideas," with the mother-and-child figure spe cifically embodying "continuity, the perpetuation of society through repopulation." Cole commented that "very high rates of infant mortality contribute to the emphasis on childbirth in Africa and indirectly to the existence of woman-and-child sculpture," and it appears that many such carvings are or were indeed created to promote healthy childbirth.2 Yet he had emphasized earlier that "African contexts for [mother-and-child] imagery and its varied ascribed meanings suggest that it is erroneous to take the maternity theme for granted or to explain it in simple terms."3 The Cleveland Museum of Art's African collection contains three magnificent examples of this particular theme or icon. Aside from monu mental sculptures from the Senufo and the Yombe peoples, the museum houses an impressive woman-and-child figure of alleged Mbala origin that is the focus of this article (fig. i).4 Holding her child on her hip, wearing an elaborate headdress and a beaded belt, and having filed teeth and red-powdered skin, the Cleveland maternity figure has been attributed to the Mbala ever since it entered the museum's collection. However, there are no firsthand field docu ments to support this ethnic attribution.5 Up to this day, Mbala art objects, as so many other works of African art, are generally identified on the basis of either their iconography or their style. With regard to the iconography of the Cleveland figure, the work could represent one of the best-known types of Mbala figure sculpture, a famous example of which is the standing figure in the Antwerp Ethno graphic Museum (fig. 2).6 Among the Mbala, the woman-and-child figure, gihalu giwenyi or simply wenyi, forms a couple with the figure of a male musician, limba. As a couple {pind?), these two images played a role in the investiture ritual of a political leader and found a home in the chiefs newly built ritual house as part of his sacred insignia. The con struction of the new house?the roof of which often was topped with a 127</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3. A group of Mbala men wearing the lobed mukoto headdress, 1907. Photo by Emil Torday, courtesy The British Museum, London. wooden sculpture in the form of a simba (blotched genet [Genetta tigrina], a small mammal)?was accompanied by a series of rituals in which the pindi figures were the focus of attention. The figures received offerings of palm wine and were sprinkled with the blood of sacrificial animals. An iron bracelet that had first been put in contact with one or both of the pindi figures was handed over to the newly invested chief to symbolize the transmission of his predecessor's power.7 With regard to the style of the Cleveland figure, the number of sculp tures in Western and African collections firmly attributed to the Mbala is far too limited to serve as a basis for stylistic comparison. Moreover, the few woman-and-child figures of confirmed or alleged Mbala origin show a striking diversity. Arthur Bourgeois identified at least nine different stylistic clusters in Mbala figure sculpture, which he believed to stem from different workshops, but from a stylistic point of view the Cleveland maternity does not really belong to any of them.8 The diversity within a seemingly unified overall style is especially vis ible in the shape of the lobed mukoto headdress, which is often considered the clue to identify a Mbala work of art.9 Smeared with oil and covered with camwood powder, this hairstyle is sometimes faithfully imitated in a wig made from a leather-covered twig framework (figs. 3?5). However, the Belgian Jesuit missionary Paul Hoet mentions that the Mbala commis sioned their typical lobed coiffures from the neighboring Kwilu Pende.10 In fact, L?on de Sousberghe, another Belgian Jesuit missionary, had al ready drawn attention to the fact that several figures had erroneously been attributed to the Mbala merely on the basis of their lobed mukoto head dress.11 In other words, contrary to what some have suggested, the form of the hairstyle depicted on many African sculptures is not an element that can be used to assign an object to one ethnic group or the other. 128</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 6.

The Cleveland figure does show some stylistic likeness to a male drum mer figure now in the collection of the art museum at the University of Iowa (fig. 6).12 The German explorer and ethnologist Leo Frobenius, who collected it along with a maternity figure near the confluence of the Kwilu and Kwenge Rivers in 1905, attributed this drummer to the Tsaam or Tsa(a)mba.13 However, this reference to the Tsaam cannot be taken at face value because Frobenius attributed a stylistically similar sculpture of four joined figures?which he also collected in 1905?to the Mbala.14 Furthermore, information about Tsaam culture is scant and there are no firsthand sources to confirm whether the Tsaam had investiture rituals 129</page><page sequence="5">Map of the Kwango-Kwilu region showing general locations of the three major Pende cultural groups and some geographical landmarks. republic! 0 F T H E L?' ****** congo) BrazzaviMf^f y^ t Kinshasa /a M B )1 0 I ? / \ f?

Scattered over a wide territory, many of these peoples are intermingled with neighboring peoples or form enclaves of ethnically heterogeneous settlements. Following de Sousberghe's argument, Bourgeois proposed to identify the masks from this region using a geo graphical rather than an ethnic label.17 Nevertheless, there are good reasons to re-attribute the Cleveland figure to the Kwilu Pende people, who live in a mixed ethnic region between the Lutshima and Kwilu Rivers and constitute one of the three major Pende cultural groups, with the Central Pende and the Eastern Pende (see map).18 Few details are known about the art of these Kwilu Pende, and it seems that most of their art production waned after the 1931 rebellion.19 The style of their sculpture is very different from the styles proper to the Central and Eastern Pende regions, overlapping 130</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 7.

In the past, the Kwilu Pende were especially known as carvers of staffs of justice {mihango). These mihango, which remained popular until the mid 1950s, were owned by "clan speakers" or lawyers (ngambi) and were thought to infuse persuasive power into their speech during their pleas. Many mihango show a human head or figure with a realistic depiction of the lobed mukoto headdress that is stylistically akin to that of the Cleve land maternity figure (fig. 7). In fact, even if it was shared by different peoples between the Kwango and Kwilu Rivers, most of the visual docu ments associate this headdress with the Kwilu Pende rather than with any other ethnic group. The style of some of the rare freestanding figures produced by the Kwilu Pende can also be related to the style of the Cleveland figure. In 1952, de Sousberghe collected a figure pair in the village of Totshi (chiefdorn of Shimuna) on the Kwilu left bank and observed many simi lar pieces in the region.20 De Sousberghe's figures had been carved for Chief Kabwita of Totshi by the reputed sculptor Mazita mwata Muhungu of the village of Ngenda-Mukulu. For de Sousberghe, these two figures confirmed the Pende origin of a maternity figure that belonged to the Rrussels collector (and dealer) Jeanne Walschot.21 Elderly sculptors inter viewed by Donatien Tukweso, de Sousberghe's field assistant, even as cribed the Walschot figure to Mazita mwata Muhungu.22 Facial traits characteristic of the art of the Kwilu Pende chiefdoms of Shimuna, Mushinga, and Ndala?but completely absent in Mbala sculpture?include a wide-open mouth, bared teeth, lozenge-shaped eye cavities, and naturalistic ears.23 These features are also represented on a Pende male figure on loan to the Royal Museum for Central Africa (fig. 8), which is perhaps the closest in style to the Cleveland mother-and l5l</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 9.

Father Hoet, who was stationed on the Kwilu left bank, collected this male figure in 1932, and de Sousberghe early recognized its dynamism, naturalism, and sculptural perfection.24 The Cleveland figure shares those qualities: the proportions are naturalistic and the finish deli cate; the mother's headdress, echoed on her baby, is rendered with careful attention to decorative detail; her face is refined, the eyes have copper tacks as pupils, and the mouth two rows of sharply filed teeth. The Mother-and-Child Icon among the Eastern Pende Among the Eastern Pende, the mother-and-child figure was especially popular as a rooftop sculpture for the chiefs ritual house {kibulu) in the 1950s. Some of these rooftop maternities, like the one de Sousberghe photographed on Chief Kombo-Kiboto's house in the village of Ndjindji in 1952 (fig. 9), hold an ax {kuba) in the right hand and a cup {bengwa) in the left.25 Very often the left hand is damaged. Other Eastern Pende rooftop sculptures also represent a standing woman holding a kuba and bengwa but no child. The Belgian art historian Albert Maesen, formerly of the Tervuren museum, who spent some time among the Pende in the 1950s, acquired one such figure in the village of Ngungu a Kasha in !954 (fig- 10) The kibulu?which the Central and the Kwilu Pende call gisendu?is the locus of important rituals and "is closely associated to the well-being of the kifutshi, the environmental microcosm necessary to the survival of any village."26 Always based on a square plan, the house of a great chief is distinguished by a courtyard surrounded by a palisade of tightly spaced stakes and living tree slips, a vestibule, and a dome-shaped roof. Inside the house, the chiefs first minister buries the seeds and grains important to Pende agriculture under the central pole from which the roof tapers down to the walls. The interior is divided into a large front room and a small back room. The outer room contains some of the more public and everyday symbols of chiefly insignia, such as the ax, the double bells, and the accessories he wears on special occasions. The inner room contains the chiefs coffin and one to three masks that form the mbuyajia ufumu (masks of the chiefly insignia). Always present is the beloved mask 132</page><page sequence="8">Fig. il. Helmet mask, Eastern Pende people, Democratic Republic of the Congo, early 20th century, wood, h. 26.1 cm. The Cleveland Museum of Art, Gift of Katherine C. White 1976.179. Kipoko, of which the Cleveland Museum of Art holds a typical example (fig. n).27 Associated with healing, this mask "represents everything warm and nurturing about the chiefs role."28 Among the Central and Eastern Pende only great chiefs {chefs de chefferies) were allowed to adorn their ritual houses with a human figure on the roof. According to de Sousberghe, the female figure that crowned the roofs of some of the Eastern Pende's kibulu referred to the mukaji wa manda, the first wife of the polygynous chief.29 An essential partner for her husband, she is responsible for a number of ritual duties relating to agriculture. Her authority is suggested by the necklace of leopard teeth, the typical headdress, and the ax and cup she holds in her hands, all im portant symbols of the chiefs investiture. As de Sousberghe recounts: On the day of the investiture, the "woman-chief" took the chiefly ax and danced with it, after which she passed it to her husband who beheaded a dog with one blow. His first minister simultaneously beheaded a he-goat. The blood of the two severed animal heads was collected in a single cup which was passed to all those present. By drinking the blood from this cup they recognized the chiefs authority. It appears that these two domestic animals replaced the men who were killed in times past.30 In his "sociological analysis" of de Sousberghe's data, P. Jan Vandenhoute concludes that the rooftop sculpture reflects many facets of Eastern Pende life and thought.31 The sculpture confirms that the chief was invested according to the ancestral prescriptions and thus reigns with the consent of the supernatural. As long as the chief is alive, the fertility !33</page><page sequence="9">of both people and land is guaranteed. All in all, the final purpose or "social function" of the sculpture, in Vandenhoute's opinion, consists of contributing to the preservation of equilibrium within society. At the same time, the Eastern Pende rooftop figure with its straightforward and monumental appearance also has real aesthetic quality; it is exhibited in the center of the village for the enjoyment of all. According to Z. S. Strother: Whatever their form, the rooftop sculptures are still associated in popular folklore with the chiefs initiation in sorcery. ... In theory, the rooftop sculpture signals the death of a close female relative, ideally a sister. In Pende culture, which is matrilineal, the loss of a sister is the greatest possible deprivation, since it entails the loss of an entire future lineage. Since the 1950s, the most popular form of statuette has made explicit the cost in lost lineage by depicting the woman as a mother with child. . . . The object functions strictly as a warning to malefactors: this chief has the power and the capability to defend his people. . . . Should you attempt evil, this chief has the ability to punish you with death. . . . The statuary associated with the kibulu advertises the chiefs role as the possessor of secret weapons, able to defend both himself and his people.32 De Sousberghe initially thought that an Eastern Pende sculptor named Kaseya Tambwe Makumbi introduced the depiction of a mother with her child in Pende art in the 1950s.53 However, de Sousberghe later discovered two maternity figures of the Central and the Kwilu Pende in the collection of Jeanne Walschot, which led him to reconsider this assumption.34 Because the Kwilu Pende maternity in the Walschot collec tion, like the Cleveland figure, would have been field collected in 1930 or earlier, it seems more likely that the Eastern Pende looked at their west ern neighbors, the Kwilu Pende, for inspiration rather than at European models. Of course, it is not impossible that the Kwilu Pende themselves were inspired by examples of European import. Rooftop, Ancestor Shrine, or Chiefs Treasure? If the Cleveland mother-and-child figure is attributed to the Kwilu Pende on stylistic grounds, an important question arises: is it a rare ex ample of a Kwilu Pende rooftop sculpture? While the Cleveland figure shares the maternity theme with the Eastern Pende, it is remarkable that close scrutiny of the figure's broken-off hands indicates that the right hand must once have held an object. The hollo wed-out fist suggests that the now-missing object had a cylindrical shaft. It seems reasonable to assume that the figure, like some Eastern Pende roof sculptures, origi nally held an ax, an important chiefly attribute. And although the traces are much less obvious, it is not impossible that the figure's left hand once supported a cup. As can be seen in Maesen's sculpture (fig. 10), among the Eastern Pende both ax and cup were carved separately and then inserted into the hollow fists. At the time of de Sousberghe's research in the 1950s, most of the ritual houses among the Kwilu Pende merely had a rooftop head, either Janus faced or single-faced, usually topped by the sculpture of a bird, a khumbi a ngongo (Abdim's or white-bellied stork [Ciconia abdimii]). In 1953, Maesen collected such a head with the typical mukoto hairstyle? *34</page><page sequence="10">''.''f,-';wW;'V^U'-.,i.'??&gt;3H^P^^^ V i ' s? Fig. 12. Rooftop head, Kwilu Pende people, Democratic Republic of the Congo, early 20th century, wood, h. 65 cm. Royal Museum for Central Africa (Africa-Museum), Tervuren, Belgium, RG 53-74-4128 originally crowned by the sculpture of a bird with spread wings?in the village of Malembe of the chiefdom of Shimuna (fig. 12).35 According to the reports of some missionaries, however, many chiefs' houses on the Kwilu left bank were more elaborately decorated in the past.36 Some bore sculptures of a crocodile or an iguana.37 Although sources do not mention that past Kwilu Pende chiefs' houses occasionally also had a rooftop maternity, at least one colonial administrator reported that in a number of Pende villages on the Kwilu left bank some chiefs' houses had an anthropomorphic rooftop sculpture.38 Nevertheless, there are at least two reasons to doubt that the Cleveland maternity once graced a roof: first, its surface is too pristine and polished to have been exposed to rain and wind in the open air; second, the figure lacks the integrated sculptured base by which it would have been anchored to the roof. Two alternative uses may be proposed: the figure could have been placed in a small sanctuary or shrine, a nganda, or it was part of the kifumu, the chiefs treasure?which the Kwilu Pende seem to call gifumu?9 The focus of the ancestor cult, the nganda shrine took the form of a miniature house and was quite common in Kwilu Pende villages, espe cially shortly before the Pende rebellion in 1931. As de Sousberghe's field notes reveal, the nganda was closely associated with the chiefs ritual gisendu house, as was another construction of unspecified shape, mbonge or kolo; both constructions are clearly related to the enclosure that the Eastern Pende call lupepe.40 The statuettes preserved in the Kwilu Pende nganda belonged to the category of mahamba: dominantly beneficial ob jects that facilitate communication with the dead, guard the ritual house, and more generally protect the well-being of the community.41 Together with other mahamba, the figure pair that de Sousberghe acquired in Totshi on the Kwilu left bank was placed in a nganda shrine within a family's house enclosure. The figures were called tungulungu twa hamba dia nganda (statuettes of the hamba of the nganda).42 Apparently, the male figure collected by Hoet (fig. 8) also once belonged to such a shrine and had a female counterpart. Considering its size and iconography, however, it is perhaps even more likely that the Cleveland figure, rather than having belonged to a nganda, was one of several accessories that a Kwilu Pende chief secretly kept in his ritual house as part of his treasure. The Kwilu Pende used a pair of male and female figures {tungulungu, a generic name for carved images) as guardians of the gifumu.43 These figures may have played a role similar to that of the Mbala pindi mentioned earlier. After their use in the investiture ritual, the Mbala pindi lived a secret life as part of the chiefs treasure, which also contained some carved zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures; the chiefs stool, fly whisk, adz, and staff of office; and, finally, a bag filled with earth of the motherland on the Kwango River, ancestral bones, and white clay. The Mbala chief, who was the only person permitted to touch the figures, invoked them when important decisions had to be made and in times of crisis, such as wars, epidemics, or bad harvests.44 Does the foregoing imply that maternity figures?along with single female or male figures and certain animal figures?were originally found only in the Pende chiefs treasure? And is their representation on the house's rooftop a later evolution? As mentioned earlier, the sculptor Kaseya Tambwe Makumbi would have launched the custom of placing a *35</page><page sequence="11">naturalistically carved image of a woman and her child on the Eastern Pende kibulu's rooftop as recently as the 1950s.45 Meanwhile, among the Central and the Kwilu Pende, the decoration of the chiefs house had fallen into disrepair, and the chiefs treasure as a rule no longer included figurative sculptures.46 Bestowed with magical powers, sculptures of the Pende chiefs' ritual houses partake in the authority of the chief and thus influence the well-being of the community and the fertility of the female population and the land.47 The Pende believe that parting with their rooftop sculp tures would cause calamities and illness. It should therefore not come as a surprise that such carvings are rarely to be found in American and European collections. With the exception of the human head in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren (fig. 12), anthropomorphic rooftop sculptures of the Kwilu Pende seem not to have been field collected at all, which might indicate that such sculptures were rare to nonexistent.48 Yet it is not impossible that figurative carvings were once frequently to be found in the sacred treasure of Kwilu Pende ritual houses. There may be more Kwilu Pende mother-and-child figures to be discovered among sculptures that have long been loosely registered under the label "Mbala."49 Thus, without losing sight of the artificial character of many of the ethnic labels given to works of African art, it would be worthwhile to reconsider the attribution of many supposed Mbala figures in Western collections. 136</page><page sequence="12">NOTES I would like to thank Zo?

The Kwilu Pende, who live between the Lutshima and Kwilu Rivers in Bandundu Province, are often grouped with the Pende living between the Kwilu and Loange Rivers under the general name "Western Pende"; see L?on de Sousberghe, L 'art Pende, M?moires, Beaux-Arts 9, fase. 2 (Brussels: Acad?mie Royale de Belgique, 1959), 8?27. However, the Pende west of the Kwilu once had their own artistic style and masquerading traditions, and they practiced customs that were considered bizarre by all other Pende; see Z. S. Strother, Inventing Masks: Agency and History in the Art of the Central Pende (Chicago/London: University of Chicago Press, 1998), 6. Therefore, a better division is into at least three regions: Kwilu Pende (west of the Kwilu River), Central Pende (between the Kwilu and Loange Riv ers), and Eastern Pende (between the Loange and Kasai Rivers). *37 The Mbala live in a vast geographi cal area between the Wamba and Bakali Rivers in the northwest and the Kwilu and Lutshima Rivers in the east. In many parts of this area they are mixed with other, often smaller popula tions. Mbala culture is internally diverse and fragmented as a result of a variety of outside influences and inter cultural contacts. The Hungarian eth nographer Emil Torday distinguished between the Northern and the Southern Mbala; Torday and Thomas A. Joyce, "Note on the Southern Ba-Mbala," Man 7, no. 52 (1907), 81?84; see also de Sousberghe, L'art Pende, 15?16. Daniel Biebuyck summarized most of the pre 1985 literature on the Mbala and their arts in The Arts of Zaire, vol. 1, South western Zaire (Berkeley/Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985). More recent articles add some original information to the data offered earlier by the Belgian Jesuit missionary Ivan de Pierpont in "Les Bambala," Congo 1, no. 1 (1932; based on notes of 1915), 22?37, and no. 2 (1932), 185?205; see Manzanza Mukobo, "La statuaire Mbala: Quelques consid?rations," Pistes et Recherches 1, no. 2 (1986), 166?79; Arthur P.

The figure entered the collection as a gift of the African Art Sponsors of Karamu House in 1931. The African Art Sponsors, a group of African American businessmen, purchased the sculpture from Guillaume De Hondt, one of Belgium's most important dealers and collectors of the time. Originally known as the Playhouse Settlement, Karamu House was "an organization that pro vided social services and arts activities for the African American community of Cleveland"; see Henry Adams, Paul Travis (1891?1975) (Cleveland: Cleveland Artists Foundation, 2001), 29. It is said that the African Art Sponsors was organized when Cleveland artist Paul Travis planned to travel to Africa in the mid 1920s with the aim to donate money for the purchase of African art objects in the field; ibid., 66.</page><page sequence="13">6. The attribution to the Mbala cannot be taken for granted here either. This maternity figure, which was acquired from the Antwerp dealer and collector Henri Pareyn in 1920, was identified as Yansi when it was first exhibited in 1937, and it is not clear on what basis the later attribution to the Mbala occurred; see Frans M. Olbrechts et al., Tentoonstelling van Kongo-kunst, exh. cat., Stadsfeestzaal, Antwerp (Antwerp: Antwerpsche Propagandaweken, 1937), no. 473. However, Biebuyck {Arts of Zaire, 1: 124) indicates that it is not known whether the Yansi chiefs insignia comprised any sculptures. Of the few small-sized woman-and-child figures attributed to the Yansi, a sculp ture in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren may have been derived from a Mbala model or even made by Northern Mbala living amid the Yansi (ibid., 130). 7. See Biebuyck, Arts of Zaire, 1: 164?65; Manzanza Mukobo, "La statuaire Mbala," 175; Bourgeois, "Jerome L. Joss Mbala Drummer," 22?25. On the basis of information provided to him by fellow missionaries, however, de Sousberghe mentions that among the Mbala, the wenyi or gihalu giwenyi consists of a bag filled with white earth of the Kwango, bones of the ancestors, chalk, and sometimes also statuettes, and would be the equivalent of the Eastern Pende's kifumu (treasure); L?on de Sousberghe, "Les Pende: Aspects des structures sociales et politiques," in Miscellanea ethnographica, Annales, Sciences Humaines 46 (Tervuren: Mus?e Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, i963)&gt; 59 8.

In fact, Bourgeois, who grouped this presumed Tsaam figure in one of his Mbala style clusters in "Helmet-Shaped Masks from the Kwango-Kwilu Region and Beyond," Iowa Studies in African Art 3 (1990), 123?24, emphasized that one had to be cautious with Frobenius's ethnic attributions; see also Biebuyck, Arts of Zaire, 1: 152?53, and Frobenius, Ethnographische Notizen, 1: 49?50 and photos 20?27. ^s Strother pointed out to me (personal communication [26 Sep tember 2002]), Frobenius's attributions were often arbitrary because ethnic identities had not yet become defined, as they were during the maturity of the colonial state. 16.

In 1931, the Pende west of the Kwilu rebelled against the colonial administra tion when labor demands reached a climax after the world depression began in 1929. One of the outcomes of the administration's brutal suppression was the erosion of respect for and prestige of chiefs among both Kwilu and Central Pende; see Strother, Inventing Masks, 8?9, 251?57. This in turn led to a de cline in the production of art objects closely related to ideas of leadership and power; Strother, personal communica tion (26 September 2002). 20.

It is interesting to note the similarity between the fiber cord attached to this male figure's waist and the beaded string that decorates the Cleveland figure. Perhaps these strings were originally meant to hold up an apron or loin-cloth to cover the figures' lower body parts. The surface of the Cleveland figure has clearly been thoroughly cleaned, however, possibly by its original Pende caretaker or, more likely, by its later European owner. Nevertheless, with its dry and reddish appearance, showing numerous traces of what seems to be ground bark-wood powder, the figure's exterior probably appears quite similar to how it looked when the statue was still in use in the Congo. The polished and glossy wood surfaces of a number of related carvings in Europe and America most often result from the application of oils, varnish, or other products by Western collectors. It has not been pos sible to determine whether the red traces on the carving's surface are those of a powder the Pende call miseke, an expensive human body cosmetic. This substance?which is not to be confused with camwood?is contained in the cup that many Eastern Pende rooftop fig ures hold in their left hand and is used abundantly in the Eastern Pende chiefs investiture; Strother, personal commu nication (12 May 2002). 25. A rather unusual example in an American private collection is carrying what seems to be a sleeping or even dead child; see Cole, Icons, fig. 45. This piece resembles the Cleveland figure in its striking kneeling position. *39 26. Z. S. Strother, "Eastern Pende Constructions of Secrecy," in Mary H.

Strother has drawn my attention to the fact that interpretations of the rooftop sculpture are remarkably varied and vague. One of the many interpretations she heard for the mother-and-child theme was offered to her by Chief Kingange. He said that the mother and child represented him (the chief) as the lemba (maternal uncle) for his family, suggesting that he was like the mother of his family members who gave birth to all of them; Strother, personal com munication (26 September 2000). 31.

Strother, "Eastern Pende Construc tions of Secrecy," 176. 33. De Sousberghe ("Cases cheffales sculpt?es des ba-Pende," 78), who learned from Chief Kisakanga of the Akwa Nzumba that the maternity fig ures?in light and soft wood and "avec un visage d'une parfaite r?gularit?"? were created at the time of the Euro pean occupation, suggested a European influence for the development of this icon among the Pende in the mid 20th century; see also de Sousberghe, L 'art Pende, 125?26, and Strother, "Eastern Pende Constructions of Secrecy," 176 and fig. 23.</page><page sequence="15">34- De Sousberghe, "Cases cheffales sculpt?es des ba-Pende," 79; de Sousberghe, L'art Pende, 145. In fact, the Walschot figure was the only Kwilu Pende maternity with which de Sousberghe was familiar. 35. De Sousberghe, L'art Pende, 123 and fig. 230. 36. Ibid., 19, 123. 37. Strother ("Eastern Pende Construc tions of Secrecy," fig. 25) made a photograph of such a crocodile rooftop sculpture in the Central Pende village of Pidi-Samba in 1989. Torday wrote about the iguana sculpture of Chief Yongo of the Western Pende Mushinga chiefdom. It has been reported that some Eastern Pende chiefs kept the sculpture of a mermaid (poisson-femme) in their ritual house; see de Sousberghe, L'art Pende, 126?27. 38. De Sousberghe, "Cases cheffales sculpt?es des ba-Pende," 76?77. 39. Donatien Tukweso, de Sousberghe's main field assistant, made similar sug gestions about the Walschot maternity, which he considered to be a hamba that was believed to give the clan's women "l'espoir de la f?condit?"; see de Sousberghe, L'art Pende, 148. 40. Strother, personal communication (31 July 2002). 41. By extension, the term also includes rituals and initiations that were insti tuted by the dead to interact with the living. For an extensive discussion of the concept of mahamba among the Pende, see Z. S. Strother, "From Performative Utterance to Performative Object: Pende Theories of Speech, Blood Sacrifice, and Power Objects," Res: Anthropology and Aesthetics 37 (2000), 57-58. 42. De Sousberghe, L'art Pende, 146. 43. Strother informed me (personal communication [31 July 2002]) that this use of a pair of figures among the Kwilu Pende is explicitly mentioned in an unpublished dissertation by the Pende scholar Sikitele Gize ("Histoire de la r?volte Pende de 1931," Universit? Nationale du Za?re, Lubumbashi, 1986). 44. Biebuyck, Arts of Zaire, 1: 165; see also de Sousberghe, "Les Pende: Aspects des structures sociales et politiques," 59. As indicated by de Sousberghe ("Cases cheffales sculpt?es des ba-Pende," 80?81), the parallels between the Pende and the Mbala rituals are striking. 140 45- The Eastern Pende Chief Kisakanga was unique in using a sculpture in the shape of a Kipoko helmet mask?one of the three masks forming the core of the chiefs treasure?as a rooftop sculpture; Strother, personal communication (26 September 2002); see also Strother, "Eastern Pende Constructions of Se crecy," fig. 24. 46. Aside from the Kwilu Pende revolt of 1931 (see note 19 above), de Sousberghe also points to the link between the construction of the chiefs ritual house and a ritual hunt and to the fact that such houses have completely disappeared in Bandundu Province because the colonial administration abolished the hunt in this part of Pendeland; de Sousberghe, "Cases cheffales sculpt?es des ba-Pende," 76, and L'art Pende, 123?25. 47. De Sousberghe, "Cases cheffales sculpt?es des ba-Pende," 76. While the rooftop sculpture among the Eastern Pende is associated with the kifumu, not all the objects that form the kifumu serve the same purpose. Moreover, ac cording to Strother, the rooftop sculp ture merely has an indirect influence on the fertility of the soil and the people. Also, whenever statuettes are to be found in the chiefs ritual house among the Eastern and the Central Pende, they are thought to be "power objects" for the personal protection of the chief alone; Strother, personal communica tion (26 September 2002). 48. Strother, however, proposes that among the Eastern Pende?where until the mid 20th century only a handful of chiefs had a right to mount an anthropomorphic rooftop sculpture? people were unwilling to part with their rooftop sculpture until it literally fell off the roof. She also suggests that the rare Kwilu Pende rooftop sculptures may not have been collected because Westerners found them too "crude" or not "art"; Strother, personal communication (26 September 2002). 49. De Sousberghe (L'artPende, 147) already pointed out that the attribution of a large number of objects to the Mbala was based on purely subjective grounds. In most published cases the reader is not even informed of the speculative nature of these attributions.</page><page sequence="16">PHOTOGRAPHY CREDITS Figs. 1,11: copyright The Cleveland Museum of Art; fig. 2: copyright Antwerp City Museums Photographic Service and Michel Wuyts, courtesy Ethnographic Museum, Antwerp; fig. 3: Emil Torday, courtesy The British Museum, London; fig. 4: Jerry L.
