<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONSCIOUSNESS AND CRITICISM James R. IHollis Estragon: (anxious) And we? Vladimir: I beg your pardon? Estragon: I said, And we? Vladimir: I don't understand. Estragon: Where do we come in? Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot In one of his later poems Wallace Stevens argues "Questions are Remarks." One might, by extension, argue that ideas are expressions of motive. And one might argue further that all motives arise out of an Urmotiv, namely, to give voice to the wisdom of the bones, to speak of what it means to be a human being. What it means to be human will of course be expressed in radically different ways by different people, but the critic can profit by discerning the enduring motive amid the profusion of secondary motives behind every work of art. Literary criticism necessarily deals with a particular consciousness, a consciousness, however, which inevitably confesses to a deeper sense of what it means to be human. Further, the relationship of parts which the artist has assembled to express that idea or complex of ideas is, of course, the aesthetic structure. The act of creation is thus the attempt to convert primary and secondary motives into primary and secondary structures. Given the profusion of secondary motives, literary criticism is accordingly an attempt to recognize or identify that conversion of motive into structure, not by challenging the validity of the motive but by examining the appropriateness, the vitality, and the originality of the resulting structure. A great deal of nonsense has been printed about the so-called "theatre of the absurd." The ideas expressed in the plays of Beckett, Adamov, Ionesco, Genet, possibly Pinter, are in themselves not particularly new to readers of Sophocles and Shakespeare and Jarry. Nonetheless, the structures in which those ideas are embodied initially suggest an obvious departure from traditional forms. However, the Urmotiv, the attempt to express what it means to be human at a particular time and place as understood by a particular dramatist is in any case a constant. What is of particular significance with regard to the "theatre of the absurd" is the attempt of a number of different artists to identify an aesthetic structure appropriate to a world which they perceive to be post-rational, post-theological, and post-modern. The particular motive of the absurdists is to testify to what it means to be human in a century in which the range of human possibilities for good and evil has been considerably expanded. They accordingly perceive the world as a place of humdn habitation, that is, a non-transcendental, non-theological environment. That which is possible is that which is humanly possible. And what were considered "transcendental" acts in an earlier age arenowperceived as options available to humans. Yet the absurdists are not unique in exploring the range of particularly human possibilities, for such has often been the tragic theme. Traditional tragic structures attest to a sense of closure and to a sense of 17</page><page sequence="2">categorical prerogatives. That is to say, there is a human realm and there is a suprahuman realm and that the prerogatives available to those inhabiting either realm are different. There are, of course, points of contact between those realms, but one thing which never happens is that the human characters successfully employ options open only to inhabitants of the suprahuman realm. Nietzsche once noted man's profound disappointment when he discovered that he was not a god. He might well have added that such a discovery has never prevented men from attempting the prerogatives of gods. What the Greeks called hybris for example, may be taken for an audacious forgetfulness on the part of some characters that there are certain things that a man cannot or should not do because either he does not really have the option of doing them or because there is an order in the universe which he will transgress in performing such acts. What the Greeks called Dike (Justice) is thus both an ontological and an epistemological assumption, for when one oversteps his due proportion, these principles of juridical balance are triggered to counter the action and bring the transgressor back into line. Such a universe is, we see, as circumscribed and contingent as a Newtonian schema of physical actions and reactions. But consider a later tragedy, Marlowe's Dr. Faustus. We know that in the end Faustus is trundled off to Hell. Hell, from the standpoint of aesthetic requirements, is a rather convenient dogma which in its own way is not unlike the necessity for the quasi-heroic death of an only partially reformed villain at the end of a television program. The script writer knows his audience will be discomfited by characters with shady pasts cluttering up an already polluted environment. In other words, Hell may be taken as a good way to get rid of a bad character and make a point at the same time. But the critical and moral significance of Marlowe's play lies elsewhere. He uses the concept of Hell because he lives in a particular context in which Hell has the appropriate spectrum of associations. If we look at Faustus more closely, we see that in the initial scene Marlowe very carefully demonstrates that what Faustus really wants to do is be more than a human being, that is, to exercise options which do not really belong to mortals.' Faustus has mastered and exhausted the options presented by the respectable professions--philosophy, physics (or medicine), law, and divinity. These are human professions and accordingly present only human options. Faustus turns at last to alchemy, to the occult metaphysics ('that is, meta physis -beyond the natural) in the hope, as he explains, that "all things that move between the quiet poles/Shall be at my command."2 Moments later he adds the revealing observation, "a sound magician is a mighty god."3 At the conclusion of the play the learned divines make it clear that Faustus may be saved if he repents. Yet he goes to Hell. He is not a monster. He is not even evil, at least not in the terms in which we have evil defined for us by our own time. Even Mephistopheles admits that "where we are is Hell."4 The chorus intones the last lines of the play, lines which seem to underline that for which Hell is but a Marlovian metonymy: Faustus is gone; regard his hellish fall, Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise Only to wonder at unlawful things, Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits To practice more than heavenly power permits.5 The play seems to be a structure testifying to Marlowe's sense of the limits of the merely human. The tragedy of Faustus is not that he affronts certain religious dogmas, but that both those doqmas and the play testify to what it means to be a man ' is Li s a background of generally accepted values. Faustus 18</page><page sequence="3">recognized the truth of that which the Greek poet Pindar advertised elsewhere, "O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible." But he was not satisfied. He was imprudent perhaps, foolish even, but not evil. As the end draws near, he finally admits to himself, "What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemned to die?"6 Perhaps in admiring his audacity, one risks a similar kind of audacity. But such a feeling is a part of one's biographical and not necessarily one's critical existence. In other words, as critics we are rather more concerned with how the concept of damnation functions in the play. What the meaning of that structure is will likely vary between Marlowe, his audience of believers or unbelievers, and the twentieth century reader. What is necessary, however, is that we understand the aesthetic demand for damnation, a demand arising out of a prior set of beliefs about what it means to be a human being in the sixteenth century. We may differ with that prior belief and offer our own, but we will be missing the point if we fail to see why it really seems structurally as well as morally necessary to Marlowe for Faustus to go to Hell. A * * * * * * We are all familiar with the contention of George Steiner and others that tragedy is a dead form in our time. The writing of tragedy depends of course on the existence of a tragic attitude, that is, a tragic motive. Tragic structure thus arises out of a number of particular assumptions, the most important of which seem to include the notion that there is a hierarchy of values, that is, that some motives are valued higher than others. Secondly, there is range of options open to the human protagonist and his accomplices and a range of options open to suprahuman entities. Furthermore, there is still another assumption, namely, that the exercise of options takes place against the background of a generally accepted network of values. Thus, whatever the protagonist does, slay his father or blaspheme the holy ones, his actions are understood and, indeed, assume their significance in reference to that hierarchical background. The second principle of tragedy is not likely to change, namely, that there is a finite number of possible courses of action arising out of a finite condition. But what happens if the first principle, the assertion of a hierarchy of values, loses some of its credibility for whatever reason? By definition then, the third principle will not be able to function either. Thus, the actions of a character, whatever they might be, can no longer be understood, even evaluated, if the backdrop of values is rent. The structure open to one who would express such a motive is that structure in which the actions of a protagonist can only be understood in terms of the protagonist himself or not understood at all. In any case, the protagonist is thrust back radically upon himself, and we find such artists as Yeats concluding, now that my ladder's gone I must lie down where all ladders start, in the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.7 or the protagonist in lonesco's Jack or the Submissionl who describes his reduced options, .. .how to escape? They've boarded up the doors, the windows with nothing, they've taken away the stairs.. .One can't get out through the attic anymore, there's no way out up there.8 Yeats, Ionesco and a host of other post-tragic9 writers conclude that if the ascent is not possible, then one must attempt the descent into the chthonic. But if the heavenly consort have been dismissed, their satanic accomplices have similarly been given notice. What has traditionally been considered the chthonic, 19</page><page sequence="4">or even the demonic, is now perceived as an expanded frontier of the human. When we consider the demythologized character of our present existence, we add a layer of irony to Brecht's little poem about a Japanese mask of evil. From that twisted countenance he learned, he tells us, "how great a strain it is to be evil."' ? Though many of us feel it is really rather easy to be evil, a significant number of the most compelling artists of our time simply do not presuppose the kind of hierarchy of values which is necessary in order to say that "X" is an evil act and "Y" is not quite so evil and "Z" is really a rather charitable thing to do. The artist whose work seems to epitomize this radical assault on the tragic motive is Samuel Beckett. For his own reasons Beckett can assume only the first part of the second attribute of tragedy, namely, the particular range of options open to the human protagonist. The hierarchical fabric is shredded beyond repair, and we see that all this time it has been covering an abyss. Since we cannot take our bearings from that background, we cannot meaningfully judge that act "X" is evil. Act "X" can at most be understood only in terms of the protagonist himself and at the least as a totally fortuitous and random act. Just as we may be prepared to debate whether Faustus should or should not go to Hell, so we may be prepared to debate whether or not that sustaining fabric has been rent beyond repair. But such debate is not literary criticism; ethics is not aesthetics even though critics as widely diverse as Wilde and Wittgenstein and the editor of Ladies Home Journal have sometimes made that connection. What kind of play, then, represents the conversion of Beckett's motives into Beckett's structures? The answer is Beckett's plays. The answer is not so tautological as it might seem because we have always to consider "the intentional fallacy," the disparity between what an author wishes to do and what he achieves as an artificer. But it is reasonable to conclude, if one pardons the superficial tautology, that the best examples of the motives of Beckett are the particular plays Beckett has written. Plays like Waiting for Godot and Endgame are structures appropriate to what is commonly called the existential motive. The existential consciousness is a view of man which, like the tragic consciousness, apprehends a limited range of options as intrinsic to the human condition. Further, this condition is intuited as horizontal and open-ended. That is to say, the protagonist is situated upon a plane in which his concrete acts are simply concrete acts. They do not take on any transcendental signification because there is no transcendental framework for reference. For this reason not only is act "X" the moral equivalent of act "Y" but any observation implying moral judgment, even equivalence, is nonsense. The condition of the protagonist, for all its limitations, is in another sense open-ended, that is to say, nothing is forbidden so long as it is humanly possible. Further, each event exists in isolation because history depends on sequence and sequence depends on a priori categories of time and space, categories, that is, which violate Beckett's apperception of a radically horizontal existence. What does a play called Waiting for Godot mean then? Is it an expression of certain fashionable post-World War II ideas? Yes, but such an answer is ultimately irrelevant. The meaning of the particular play titled Waiting for Godot is a critical apprehension that the structure of the play defines itself as a structure of waiting. One may wonderwhyhe has to work so hard to answer such an obvious question. But in some sense the context in which Beckett works and even the descriptive title he employs are extra-literary. The only critical meaning of a text is what the text does to define itself. The title implies that 20</page><page sequence="5">there are two principal constituents to the play--the act of waiting and the act of waiting for Godot. Only the act of waiting is defined, however, by the play. Godot is not God, nor a pun on the French diminutive for Charlie Chaplin. Godot is that for which the characters wait. Godot's name is, of course, irrelevant. Only that the characters are waiting is finally important. What are we to expect, then, from a play whose initial line is "Nothing to be done." We expect that nothing is to be done. We are told later that one of the characters would like to go. Vladimir: We can't. Estragon: Why not? Vladimir: [Because] we're waiting for Godot.11 Each act concludes with the phrase "let's go," but they do not move. Structurally they cannot move, precisely because there is nothing to be done, nothing except to wait. The structure of the play, a structure characterized by a stasis and horizontal options, confirms that Beckett has not deceived us in his title and that Beckett's plays are reasonably good examples of Beckett's motives. Endgame similarly confronts us with a structure attesting to the radical reduction of human motives and options to the purely existential, that is, acts performed without reference to any transcendental, historical, or a priori possibilities. Indeed, the play testifies to the bankruptcy of all former jeux ('esprit. The initial line of this play tells us that it is, Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished. 2 From that point on the characters stand in the presence of the final stasis, the final silence. The paralysis and spiritual torpor they exhibit is, of course, a conversion of Beckett's apperception of stasis and torpor as the primary characteristics of our condition. Yet the difference between Marlowe and Beckett, between the tragic and the existential consciousness, is not so great as it might first seem, for both have written plays whose primary structures testify to the limits of the merely human. Marlowe does indeed understand that limitation in the context of a cosmos relatively stable when compared to Beckett's cosmos in jeopardy. While he concludes by admonishing that one ought not practice more than heavenly power permits, and Beckett concludes by confessing to a radically anthropomorphic view of human possibilities, both assert finally, however, that those possibilities are circumscribed by the condition itself and not by the relationship of that condition to something else. There is yet another perspective which may be considered in comparing the tragic and the existential consciousness and the kinds of structures which derive therefrom. For both a Marlowe and a Beckett language itself, its use and limitations, provides the implicit subject matter. All artists have recognized the gap between what they would articulate and what they are able to express. Some have made this necessary failure to communicate the overt subject of a successfully communicative work. But all, in a deeper sense, have embodied the problem of language as their implicit subject matter. One of the ways in which the limits of language have been partially solved is through an allusive appeal to secondary structures. Lear curses Kent, Now by Apollo-- and Kent rejoins, Now by Apollo, King, Thou swear'st thy gods in vain. 3 21</page><page sequence="6">Not only does Lear petition the hidden hierarchy of the gods in order to convey the degree of his wrath, but he may well be unwittingly summoning those same gods to stand in judgment of his house as they had once before. Whether or not Shakespeare has both allusive possibilities in mind one can only guess, but at least his character inhabits a world in which allusion is possible. At least his character has recourse to a secondary structure whose meanings are defined and whose significance he can utilize as it suits his purpose. Whether or not one lives in a mythologized world, a world in which it is possible to make meaningful statements by allusive means, may finally be a product either of one's time or of one's choice.. Part of the problem of the post-modern consciousness is simply that that which was once the insight of the few isnowthe confessed condition of the many. Language cannot now nor has it ever borne the full import of what it means to be human; however, the recourse of allusion to hierarchical values, the recourse of the artist past, is generally unavailable to the artist present. Of the overwhelming testimony available, but a few examples of the crisis of language are cited: "I use the words you taught me. If they don't mean anything anymore, teach me others. Or let me be silent;" ". . .we are recording a kind of crisis in thought, which naturally reveals itself in a crisis of language--in words that no longer mean anything, in whole systems of thought that are reduced to monolithic dogma, an architecture of cliches. . .;" "the words in our aging vocabulary are like very sick people. Some may be able to survive; others are incurable."1 4 One would assume that one of the motives particularly compelling to the post-modern consciousness is to construct or re-construct a mythic background to function as an allusive vehicle for going beyond the impotent language of a demythologized world. For Blake and the early Yeats, who concluded that they must create their own mythology or be enslaved by another man's, the weaving of such an allusive fabric was deliberate and agonizing. Marlowe found a mythos yet available to him to express his sense of the condition. Beckett perceives only emptiness, and his aesthetic structures, in making an empty world and an empty language themselves the subjects, unite the act of language and the subject of language. In this sense, Blake's observation that "what is now proved was once only imagined"'5 seems particularly descriptive of the dislocation or relocation of consciousness from Marlowe to Beckett. For both, form is the embodiment of a consciousness, a complex of motives ranging from the tragic to the existential. In Beckett, however, the form testifies to an added element, the consciousness of consciousness. Marlowe knows that his language is inadequate to his task, but he has yet the recourse of indirection, of allusion to commonly accepted meaning. In the failure of language and the concomitant impossibility of allusory meaning Beckett finds his subject. An artist is more than that of which he is conscious, but he is nothing more finally than his consciousness; his aesthetic accomplishment is more than that of which he is conscious, but it is nothing more finally than the conversion of that consciousness into "a local habitation and a name."' 6 The consciousness of the critic is, however extended and deepened'. by the consciousness embodied in the aesthetic structure he examines, undoubtedly his own. He may share the particular assumptions and inhabit the particular world of a Marlowe, a Beckett, or a third, but his critical task must begin by discerning which jeux d' esprit have ended, which continue under new names, and which are newly begun. Perhaps, to answer Estragon's question, that is where we come in. 22</page><page sequence="7">NOTES Christopher Marlowe, The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus, ed. Anthony Caputi (Boston: D. C.
