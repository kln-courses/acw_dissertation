Naidu Drawing upon the writings, speeches, experiments, adumbrations and explanations of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, one can construct the ideal typology that emerges out of the Gandhian vision of the ideal political society. But Gandhi was a "practical idealist." As such he also put forth ideas on what we may call the "transitional state," the polity that could evolve into the "ideal political society." In my other writings, I discussed how Gandhism views the modern industrial state and rejects all its fundamental premises. In this article I shall discuss the Gandhian ideal typologies of economy (in terms of industry, technology and agriculture), of polity (in terms of structures and techniques of democracy) and of society (in terms of cultural value and social behaviour). The Ideal Industry Gandhism rejects massive industrialization. The ideal industry it proposes is the "basic industry" that is small scale and depending upon indigenous technology, resources, investments, labour and consumers. Such "cottage industries" would be labour-intensive but not capital and technology intensive. The productivity of basic industries, symbolically called khadi industries (literally, khadi is home-spun handloom cloth), would be marginal and limited, not necessitating huge supplies of raw materials, not generating enormous surpluses, not depending upon millions of consumers, and not built upon the acquisition of colonies and empires, and military power and wars. The special problems of mass transportation, mass communications and massive markets would not arise. Because "simple living and high thinking" is the basic orientation of Gandhism, Gandhian view of industries is not aimed at generating unlimited economic abundance, consumerism and materialism for higher "standards of livinginstead, Gandhism emphasizes reduced materialism, controlled consumerism and increased spiritualism, for higher "standards of life." So the attainment of the Gandhian ideal of the khadi industry would entail a certain amount of deindustrialization in highly industrialized states, and a redesigning of economic planning in the developing countries in order to avoid the mistakes of massive industrialization.</page><page sequence="2">24 M. V. Naidu The Ideal Technology Gandhian opposition to dehumanized science-technology is consistent with its opposition to massive industrialization. Instead of being the "slave" of humanity, modern technology has gained dictatorial power over the citizens of the modern state. Dehumanized technology dictates what is to be produced, of what quality, of what quantity, and most important of all, for what purpose. The answers to these questions are being determined by the capabilities of technology and the perceptions of the profiteers in the corporate sector, of the ruling class in politics and of the military elite, irrespective of the concerns of public welfare, health, and happiness. It seems technology has developed its own logic and dynamism; human considerations have become irrelevant to technological determinism, of the economy, the polity and culture. Some of the critical problems generated by technological determinism include: industrial pollution that damages earth, water, air and space; built in obsolescence that is meant to create enormous waste; artificial scarcity that manipulates prices; unscrupulous use of surpluses to pursue cold war intrigues; marketing of ill-developed and harmful products for making the "fast" buck; gun-running, military trade and aid for the profiteering of the "merchants of death;" dumping goods or disregarding economic-technological sanctions; use of so-called foreign aid programs to create captive markets, consumerism and materialism, and so on. Gandhism rejects technological determinism and its dehumanization. At an early stage, Gandhi rejected outright modern technology and its products including the assembly line, the train and truck, the new pharmaceuticals, etc., but later readjusted his stand to accept technology that does not make human beings irrelevant to the machinery or the economy. At first he could accept only the simple charkha (the manual spinning wheel) that could be operated by one individual. But later he was willing to accept the amber charkha that did the job of six persons thereby adding to one's productivity and income. The nature, the quality, the typology, the productivity and the role of technology should be determined not by profiteers or power mongers but for human considerations in a given society at a given time. Gandhian idealism would, therefore, require a certain degree of de-technologicalization of the high-tech massive industries, and would emphasize appropriate technology that is determined by native interests and local conditions, and not by outside experts for considerations of outside or external industry and economy.</page><page sequence="3">The Gandhian Vision of the Ideal Society and State 25 The Ideal Agriculture Gandhian economy advocates heavy reliance upon agriculture, instead of mass industrialization. But this agriculture has to be small scale and dependent upon local natural conditions, resources and indigenous technology. There is enough evidence in the industrialized world today to point out that agricultural surpluses have created the curse of abundance. However, Gandhism would be deeply involved in fighting in the Third World the curse of agricultural poverty, especially food scarcity, the products of centuries of colonial exploitation and neglect. Food self-sufficiency, in the Gandhian view, would be important not only in terms of providing the basic need of the people, but also in terms of not having to depend upon basic imports from outside the community. The Gandhian ideal, therefore, is a village economy that is self sufficient in agriculture and food, and is self-regulated in the context of ecological harmony and swadesi (indigenous) goods. The Ideal Economy Avoidance of massive industrialization or inauguration of a process of deindustrialization, elimination of high technology or initiating a process of detechnologicalization, overcoming of agricultural poverty and food insufficiency or starting a process of reduction in unnecessary agricultural surpluses, and the setting up of the village or local community as the unit for all economic considerations or the initiation of a process of decentralization of national and international agricultural-industrial-technological forces—these measures would lead to the reduction or elimination of other infra-structures and factors of mass economy; factors like (1) mass transportation and mass media of communications; (2) big banks, big investments, big business and big labour; (3) big military industries, military trade and aid; (4) international economic rivalries in terms of seeking colonies or neocolonies, and fighting wars to gain and sustain economic hold and status in the world; (5) heavy industrial pollution leading to ecological disasters and environmental imbalances; and (6) immoral economics necessitated by dehumanization of the economy for the purposes of profit and power for the ruling class. The ideal economy for Gandhism would be the economy that is built upon small scale agriculture and khadi industries, based upon indigenous and appropriate technology, and tailored to make the village or local community self-sustaining and self-controlled. Such village welfare (gram uddhar) should eventually shed the evils of</page><page sequence="4">26 M. V. Naidu modern industrial economy that are endangering the very existence of Mother Earth and humanity. The Ideal Political System The big state of today, the product of modern industrialization is the most powerful political system that humanity has devised so far in history. Today's state is powerful because it has huge population or it controls the lives of millions; it has or it controls huge territory; it has enormous military capabilities; and it has tremendous economic wealth gained through economic exploitation of the peoples within and economic subjugation of foreign countries. The operational form of the state is the government; monopolistic state is big state. Big state is built upon big government. The big government is the result of certain "big" economic and political forces—economic forces like big industry, big agriculture, big technology, big business, big labour, big transportation, big mass media, big military, big corporation, big tax and big budget; political forces like big interest groups, big political parties, big elections, big law, big bureaucracy, big police, big prisons and camps, big propaganda and thought-control, big nationalism and militarism, and big wars. As the power of the big government/state keeps growing, the representativeness of the government/state becomes narrower and narrower, ending up in the authoritarian regime and the cult of personality. The totalitarian state is the inevitable natural culmination of the big industrial state. In other words, under the modern industrialization, the government/state has become bigger and powerful while the people have been reduced to minor role and powerlessness. Though the material standards of living of the peoples in the industrialized world have been raised and are being sustained at the cost of impoverishment of the poor and Third World, the very existence of humanity is being threatened by industrial pollution and by the potential nuclear war. According to Gandhian standards, this is neither progress nor desirable achievement. Real human progress to Gandhism lies in providing citizens the basic material needs along with economic justice, social equality, political liberty, intellectual growth and spiritual advancement of all the peoples of the world. This is sarvodaya (universal well-being). To Gandhism, therefore, the modern authoritarian state cannot be the ideal political system. Gandhism propounds the opposite as the ideal—a political system that consists of a small community and a small territory, and that is redeemed of big economy, big military and</page><page sequence="5">The Gandhian Vision of the Ideal Society and State 27 big politics. Gandhian ideal political system is, therefore, the village republic that is economically and politically self-governed. Gandhi calls it the panchayati raj. Once Gandhi called his ideal system an ocean with a centrifugal centre occupied by the individual/village. The achievement of the ideal village republic in the Third World would mean the abandonment of the craze to copy the big industrial state and the recreation or resuscitation of the local community that has existed for a long time in such societies. The establishment of the panchayati raj in the industrialized states would imply the degovernmentalization through deindustrialization, demilitarization and debureaucratization to achieve decentralization of economic and political power out of the consequent social-economic forces; in a word true "participatory democracy." Foundations of the Ideal Political Society A political system is not made up of constitutional documents or declarations; nor does it mean grand buildings called parliaments, secretariats and courts; nor does it mean the rituals of elections, the parades of military forces, or the waving of national flags and the singing of national anthems; nor does it mean the assumptions of democratic titles by anti-democratic dictators and their regimes. The reality of the political system is determined by the values and beliefs, attitudes and behaviours of the political leaders, the administrative officials, the court judges, the economic managers, the schoolteachers, the church elders, the family members, and of the citizens at large. The political system is not simply a system of government, but also a way of life. In other words, culture (especially political culture) and socialization (especially political socialization) determine the reality of the political system by shaping its nature and its traditions, its achievements and its aspirations, and its stability and its growth. The cultural atmosphere and the social soil selects and germinates the seeds of a particular political system, while political socialization fertilizes and nourishes the political plant to grow, blossom forth and to fruition. The Gandhian political ideal of self-sufficient and autonomous village republic cannot be achieved without the ideal society that has been built upon certain cultural values and social behaviours. The following five elements could be considered as the fundamentals of the Gandhian ideal society: satya (Truth), Prema (Love), Seva (Service), Sarvodaya (Universal Well-being) and Ahimsa (Nonviolence).</page><page sequence="6">28 M. V. Naidu Truth is God At one stage of his life, Gandhi propounded that "God is Truth." After some "Experiments with Truth" (the title of his autobiography), he altered his position in 1926 and said that "Truth is God." Starting with the theological premise, Gandhism evolved the philosophical proposition. Theology prescribes the Truth; philosophy postulates a hypothetical absolute. Theology, built on blind faith, has to be monolithic and hence dogmatic in its goal, in its path to that goal, in its instruments, agents and methods; philosophy, which rests on reason and exploration, can be pluralistic and open-ended in everything. Gandhi espoused the Hindu concept of God. This has confused some protagonists of religionism. In contrast to the theological, anthropomorphic and personalized God enshrined in the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, the Hindu God is a concept of metaphysical explanations, a postulate of pluralistic exploration and a code of ethical enunciations; Gandhi sometimes called truth the "Inner Voice." Hinduism, in fact, should not be considered a religion as understood in the West; in its essence, Hinduism is a compilation of different systems of philosophies and ethics, ranging from atheism, agnosticism and materialism to naturalism, polytheism and monotheism. Viewed in this context, Gandhi's god is not the creation of theological limitations, or the crusader for religious dogma, or the prisoner of parochial prejudices. Gandhi's God is an open-ended hypothesis for a universalist and humanist explanation; Gandhi's God is a concept of absolute truth. The Gandhian concept of truth being God, indeed, provides a framework of philosophical and social analyses. If God represents the hypothetical absolute that is ultimate, universal and eternal, and hence the ideal, towards which everything moves, then any truth, whether metaphysical or mathematical, ethical or economic, political or polemical, could be tested on the touchstone of this hypothetical absolute purpose (telos); this teleology provides the broad-ranged standard of analysis that could be applied across classes, regions and cultures. Another implication: in this analytical scheme, truth is a human concept, and as such it is subjective, relative and relatively tentative. Yet these limiting attributes do not permit negativism, cynicism or scepticism, because human purposiveness lies not in attaining the truth, but in constantly trying to define and refine our concepts of truth through all possible searches, experimentations and verifications. As in science, every established concept of truth in</page><page sequence="7">The Gandhian Vision of the Ideal Society and State 29 human knowledge is truth, until it is disproved. Once the existing concept is disproved, then we must be willing to discard it, to accept the new concept and to start a fresh line of enquiry. This scientific spirit and philosophical approach imparts to all human endeavours the qualities of positiveness, purposiveness and dynamism. In this sense Gandhism is an optimistic philosophy of life, in contrast to the pessimistic view of human nature that considers humans as the products of original sin, condemned to damnation, or that life for all human beings is, in Hobbesian language, "nasty, brutish and short." Truth Needs Freedom The Gandhian approach to truth also means that the scope for new questions and the opportunity for new experiments should always be present if human concepts of truth are not to become strangulated with conformism or dogmatism. Stagnant concepts negate the unending search for truth. The questioning attitude and the experimental approach to truth demand an environment that provides and guarantees the freedom to think, to speak, to write, and to express oneself in support of and in opposition to the existing concepts of truths, their spokesmen and the political authorities behind them. These freedoms, in turn, rest upon other freedoms—the freedom of movement, association and assembly; of voting, becoming political candidates and conducting election campaigns, and of guarantees of fair and just procedures of the government assuring due process, rule of law and equal protection of the law. Truth Demands Equality If Gandhian truth can be interpreted to be a human concept, then we may ask, which human being is capable of such conceptualization? Is this capacity available to all or many? Or is it limited to one or some who represent a particular class, caste, or community? Sex, status or society? Race, religion or region? Nationality, nation or nation-state? Gandhism is catholic and broad-minded in all its perspectives. It does not prescribe or ascribe or approve any form of discrimination or inequality. To the Indian masses Gandhi explained his commitment to human equality in his inimitable style arguing in the Upanishadic idiom that all human beings are the divine sparks coming out of the Great Divine Flame; sharing such divinity, how could any one be evil or inferior? The Gandhian concept of equality is not to be reflected in simple majoritarianism, or in shutting off individual dissent. A simple</page><page sequence="8">30 M. V. Naidu arithmetical counting of individual heads or mechanical votes may not represent either Rousseau's General Will or an agreement on any concept of truth. Consensus, resulting from mutual exchange of ideas and opinions, peaceful persuasion or satisfying compromise, is a better measure of equality and a better indicator of mutual respect based on equality. "Majority tyranny" that is justified on basis of numbers in the mass democracy of today, seriously undermines the concept of equality. To make equality meaningful, individual argument should neither be disallowed nor be persecuted or be counted out, because every human being, according to Gandhian view, is capable of comprehending truth in his or her own way. In democratic context, this individualism is the very foundation for a charter of rights, which insulates and protects one person's liberties against the attack even by a majority of 99.9%. But Gandhian individualism does not propose a "tyranny of the minority" either. While advocating determination and courage for an individual to stand by his/her concept of truth, Gandhism constantly proposes that a satyagrahi (seeker of truth), should always be open minded towards the opposite viewpoint, should avoid any evil intention of hurting or harming or inconveniencing or exploiting the opponent, and should be ever willing to seek meaningful compromises without sacrificing one's principles. Thus the Gandhian approach to satya (truth) implies a philosophy that rests upon teleology as conceptualized by human mind with all its subjectivity and relativity of understanding, yet optimistic and dynamic in its orientation, and demanding a full commitment to fundamental freedoms and human equality. By laying such foundations of liberty and equality through satyagraha (truth force), Gandhian philosophy and praxis prepared India for democracy. Truth is Built on Love If every human being is capable of comprehending satya, and if we are constantly engaged in search for new concepts for truth or in struggle for improving our concepts of truth, then we must undertake two basic measures: one, we must protect and preserve the life, and aid and abet the health of every human being so that the truth that he/she holds is not lost to us; this implies elimination of killing and bodily injury, disease, hunger and poverty; the other, we must always try to understand other individuals so that our concepts of truth can be tested, validated or improved. These measures need our commitment</page><page sequence="9">The Gandhian Vision of the Ideal Society and State 31 to care, to serve and to appreciate other human beings who may be the custodians of our purposiveness and the carriers of our enlightenment. Gandhi also equated love and God. Obviously one cannot care for a person whom one hates or despises, or for whom one has no respect or affection. Love {prema) represents absence of spite and presence of respect, affection and care. Loving the fellow being is, therefore, the primordial preparation for satyagrahi (seeker of truth), who is engaged in struggle. Satyagraha (struggle for truth) integrates liberty, equality with fraternity. Understanding implies, first of all, open-mindedness; then a willingness to listen. Fad or fanaticism, and pride or prejudice may keep our minds closed. Lack of respect and empathy for the other person may hinder our willingness to listen. Without all of these preconditions, understanding is not possible. But understanding another person is not enough. Understanding others must be followed by an evaluation of one's own ideas and a willingness to drop our discredited ideas. Ego or fear may dissuade us from accepting the new idea. Even after accepting the new idea, we may not be able to act upon it; habit and conformism may prompt us not to implement the new idea. Only love (resulting from respect and empathy or sympathy) can conquer ego or selfishness, prejudice or fear, and fads or stubborn habits. Search for truth requires love; satyagrahi needs prema. Service as an Expression of Love The ultimate expression of true love is service (seva) of sacrifice (,tyaga) towards the object of our love. Love is, therefore, a process of giving, sharing, caring and sacrificing. Selfish or self-centered love or self-love are terms in contradiction. In the Gandhian context, then, the concepts of "self-respect" and "self-love," as advocated by modern psychoanalysis and psychiatry, cannot be conducive for developing love for others. Love demands sublimation of the self through self abnegation; then and only then can love learn to share and sacrifice. Seva and tyaga emanate out of prema; service and sacrifice cannot be expressions of selfishness, egotism, prejudice, hate, destruction or death. Universal Well-being, the Precondition for Truth The benedictions of truth, the overwhelming presence of love, and the ennobling instrument of service cannot be confined to a particular class, or be reserved for a special group, or a "chosen people." They</page><page sequence="10">32 M. V. Naidu are elements that are relevant, meaningful, necessary and beneficial for all human beings irrespective of race, religion, region, nationality or state. So any attempt at enriching one's own family or class at the cost of others, any policies of oppressing other states for the benefit of one's own state, any program causing intellectual and cultural degeneration of other nations so as to help the development of one's own nation, are counterproductive to the very goals of one's growth, because by such activities we destroy truths, love and services that others could have contributed to our own development and well-being more than this, in the process of hating and destroying others, we could brutalize our own capacities to love and to grow. There are certain simple truths that one cannot ignore: life cannot be meaningful amidst death; wealth cannot be multiplied when surrounded by poverty; development gains no advantage dealing with backwardness; happiness cannot be enthralling in an environment of tragedy; we cannot brutalize others without brutalizing ourselves. Intelligent and farsighted persons can easily realize that economic wellbeing of every human being, the social-political satisfactions of all states, the intellectual and cultural advancement of all nations, would prove beneficial for all human beings everywhere. This is the concept of sarvodaya, (universal well-being), also referred to as universal love. Sarvodaya should become the very framework for mapping and measuring the well-being of a particular class, or people, or state. Nonviolence, the Ultimate Test Violence (himsa) is, first of all, resort to physical force. The obvious purpose of such force is to inflict bodily pain or injury or death on the opponent. Behind such violent acts there is a mental or emotional outburst that precedes the act and that colours the post-facto stage. The emotions that can work-up a person to the point of using physical force are usually roused by momentary or long-lasting anger, hate, prejudice, intolerance, fanaticism, fear, revengefulness, etc., all factors that are antithetical to understanding, respect, empathy, sympathy, affection and sacrifice which are the manifestations of love. Thus violence (physical and psychological) is antithetical to love. As ahima (nonviolence) is non-use of physical force and of ill will towards others; ahimsa is a derivation and a manifestation of prema (love). Cannot parents or teachers inflict corporal punishment on the child in order to bring good to the child? Cannot the society use violence for the well-being of its citizens? Cannot a state wage war to end war? In other words, cannot violence be used as a means to serve</page><page sequence="11">The Gandhian Vision of the Ideal Society and State 33 love, i.e., for good ends like protection, retribution, deterrence, discipline, etc.? This question poses the age-old dichotomy of "means" and "ends." At the early stage of his philosophical evolution, Gandhi accepted this dichotomy by accepting nonviolence as the right means for the attainment of truth, the good ends. The Gandhian argument at this stage was that one cannot reach good/moral ends with bad/immoral means, because the means in some way colours and shapes the ends. At a later stage, Gandhi changed his focus; he postulated that ahimsa (nonviolence) embodies two aspects, the means and the end, thereby eliminating the dichotomy between means and ends. According to this logic, the Gandhian concept of ahimsa became merged with prema (love); thereby, ahimsa became enriched in content and quality. With nonviolence anything and everything is possible and acceptable; without it, nothing meaningful or moral can be attained. That is, truth develops and survives through nonviolence; the search for truth is impossible with violence. Concepts of truth could rise, change or disappear as the search for truth keeps going, but nonviolence cannot be reduced, altered or discarded. Nonviolence is the sine qui non for all other concerns—economic, social, political, ideological, intellectual, aesthetic, moral and spiritual; hate or death is the negation of all human concerns. As expressions of love, service and sacrifice (seva) cannot be the fruits borne to death, destruction or hate. Ahimsa is the force that generates the qualities of mercy, generosity and caring. Thus nonviolence is also the foundation for service. The willingness to work for general good and the well-being of all humanity without discrimination (i.e., sarvodaya) needs attitudes of sharing, habits of sacrificing, values of fraternity, programmes of peaceful relations and policies of non-use of violence—all reflections of nonviolence. So sarvodaya is possible only through ahimsa. In short, the fountainhead and the cornerstone for the elements of truth, love, service and universal well-being is nonviolence. Ahimsa can thus be seen as omnipotent, universal and the eternal force of life; hence it should be the focus of all things for all human beings. Perhaps this logic drove Gandhi to postulate that ahimsa is the most important consideration, the final test, the ultimate justification for everything, and the supreme truth that should be the goal, the motivation and the methodology for all seekers of truth (the satyagrahis)-, Gandhi pleaded for the "sovereignty of ahimsa."</page><page sequence="12">34 M. V. Naidu Conclusion The ideal typologies that I have derived from a Gandhian vision of the perfect society, economy and polity, puzzle and confuse the critics of Gandhism. Many critics consider Gandhian plans as too naive and simplistic for serious consideration; most call Gandhian ideals reactionary, proposing a return to primitive society; some critics consider the Gandhian approach too saintly, demanding superhuman qualities. All these critiques could be seriously challenged, logically answered and effectively rebutted. Gandhi was no doubt a great idealist. His enunciation and advocacy of nonviolence was at first rejected by almost every Indian leader and party. Still he won over all his opponents, experimented with and adapted the technique of nonviolence and proved himself the world's greatest pragmatist and history's greatest activist who mobilized millions of immobilized masses to rise and to successfully challenge and defeat the well entrenched British imperial power, and prepared Indians for running the biggest democracy on earth. As the "practical idealist," Gandhi also developed ideas on how to transform in a realistic manner the existing state system into his ideal society. One can develop and delineate the "transitional" state as it emerges out of Gandhi's statements and experiments.</page></plain_text>
