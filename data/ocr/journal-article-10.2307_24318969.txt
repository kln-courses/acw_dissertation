<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chocolate: Cultivation and Culture in pre-Hispanic Mexico EDITORIAL The Frilit of the Tree of I^ife Margarita de Orellana Mesoamerica—the present-day lands of Mexico and Central America—is the origin of one of the most delectable foods: chocolate. Archaeologists and historians have revealed that it was the Olmecs, and then the Maya, who turned cacao into a thing of wonder by cultivating it and incorporating it into their culture, later bequeathing their knowledge to the Mexicas, who took full advantage of this sacred tree's many qualities. Mesoamericans extracted wisdom from cacao and also used it for commercial, nutritional, medicinal and spiritual purposes. Cacao also featured in their artistic expressions. They portrayed it as the "tree of life" and considered the cacao-beverage to be the "food of the gods." Figurative and abstract depictions of cacao have been found on ceramics and stone carvings, as well as in codices and murals. These representations allow us to explore and begin to understand the symbolic value that cacao had for these cultures: they are the key to our grasping of the reality of this tree in the Mesoamerican world. What we consider nowadays as works of art al low us to imagine and wonder about the often coded, secretive meanings of cacao's representations. And these works of art show us that the Mesoamericans' relation ship with nature was clearly very different to ours, and from this distinct relationship with nature stems an en tire culture of cacao, about which we possess only frag mentary knowledge. One of our goals at Artes de México is to comprehend these cultures' way of thinking by examining their art works: to rediscover that facet of Mesoamerican reality revealed to us by images of their unique world. The works presented on the pages of this issue reveal an exaltation of life and a will to remember this sacred beverage in an effort to counteract the forces that have tended to silence or deny its impor tance. The artists responsible for these works were likely to have been moved by religious beliefs, rather than aesthetics, associated with the spiritual signifi cance of cacao. In common with all transcendental works, Mesoamerican art depicted cacao in an attempt to understand and explain its intrinsic powers, and placed the plant within the social imaginary of those who cultivated and consumed it. Various experts take us on a brief tour of the differ ent aspects of the cacao tree and its magical fruit in pre Hispanic Mexico. Coordinated by Valentine Tibére, the articles provide a number of answers to the many ques tions surrounding the meaning of this tree and its fruit. Tibére revises the Popol Vuh—a text that lends much more importance to corn than to cacao, though the two food stuffs indeed appear to be two faces of the same coin: corn as a solar plant and cacao as the obscure, hidden side of life. Her daring hypotheses will no doubt lead to further interesting discussions. Jean-Michel Hoppan describes how the glyphs of Mayan inscriptions provide the only proof that the word "cacao" existed before the arrival of the Spaniards, and he deciphers some of these glyphs found on Maya ceramics and stonework. Philippe Nondedeo explains that chocolate was a beverage reserved for the elite: it was an essential element of protocol at major banquets, served in unique and so phisticated vessels at social ceremonies where economic and political unions were established. This is yet another affirmation of the enormous social and religious value of this plant—along, of course, with corn—to the Maya. And Nikita Harwich describes cacao's role as a lucrative commercial item for the Mexicas and later for the Span iards too; and how it was also traded for African slaves and used in contraband trade. Nisao Ogata points out how the Olmecs and the Maya were some of the few sedentary cultures capable of managing highly biologically diverse ecosystems. None theless, cacao production in Latin America now lags far behind Africa. In Mexico, we run the risk of losing an important part of our pre-Hispanic heritage by not in cluding certain varieties of cacao in programs to improve the species' genetic diversity. Oddly enough, Mexicans produce and consume little chocolate and this precious foodstuff has only recently begun to receive a modicum of the attention it deserves. New Spain ceased to be self sufficient in cacao production ever since the late-eigh teenth century, despite the outstanding legacy left to us by the ancient Mexicans. This issue of Artes de Mexico presents examples of this rich heritage,works that con stitute the memory of this lapsed grandeur.

In the place of light and heat, in the place of the world, the cacao has flowered, is frothing, and the drink, that inebriates with flowers. I breathe it in, my heart savors it, my heart is inebriated, in truth my heart knows it: Hail redness of rubber collar! fresh and fiery, you light your garland of flowers, O mother! Sweet, delicious mother, precious flower of roast corn, you only offer yourself, you shall be abandoned, you shall have to depart, you shall remain unfleshed. Here you have come, before the princes, you, marvelous creation, inviting to pleasure. On the mat of blue and yellow feathers here you are set up. Precious flower of roast corn, you only offeryourself you shall be abandoned, you shall have to depart, you shall remain unfleshed.

PRIMORDIAL SEED The Cliocoklfe of the Wawn l^ife Valentine Tibere «n the fringes of human memory, in the era of the Third Sun, the divine grandparents Xmucane and Xpyiacoc decided to settle near the lakes whose dark waters stretch mirror-like along the moist lands of Soconusco. They had two sons, twins, who in turn twice had twins, all of them descendants of Ahpuh: powerful shamans, artists in spirit, star hunters wield ing blowpipes, cosmic ballgame players. The outlines of their twin silhouettes still appear on the white stone of Izapa monuments in the form of small men fighting a cosmic bird or facing a giant fruit-bearing cacao tree. On the monument depicting the creation of the world, the Ahpuhs' emblematic fish dive head-first into the heavens, swimming towards a curling corn design and a U shape that evoke the future glyph for the word "ca cao." However, the Popol Vuh (the "bible" of K'iche' Maya Genesis) only describes one episode in the ad ventures of the two generations of Hero Twins—the victory of 1-Hunahpu as the god of corn—relegating the cacao tree of kings and shamans to the realm of shadows and oblivion. Tree of Shadow, Chocolate of Oblivion Wild cacao trees grow in the understory of tropical rainforests. Sheltered by the huge trees that protect them from the sun and strong winds, they yearn to reach the sky and can soar to a height of twenty feet. The easiest way of domesticating them is by pruning. They then yield large pods, ripening from jade green to golden yellow or blood red, which sprout from the trunk and thrive in the shade of the cacahuanantli, "mothers of cacao" trees. Like the cacao tree itself hid den in old-growth rainforest, the depiction of the cacao tree remains discrete, even marginal, in the abundant pre-Hispanic artworks discovered in archaeological digs. The ownership of cacao trees was nonetheless the privilege of royals, at least since the apogee of great Maya polities. It was then cultivated near the palac es and ceremonial centers of the "hot lands." Cacao beans were transported on the backs of porters to the Mayor cities of the Mexican highlands whose altitude made it too cold to cultivate cacao. Though cacao trees and their fruit appeared in paintings, engravings and sculptures in the enormous highland metropolis of Teotihuacan, the tree itself is infrequently depicted by later cultures. It is however represented on the tomb of Maya king Pakal (seventh century) at Palenque, on the fresco of the Red Temple at Cacaxtla Qcirca eighth century) and on the walls of the Temple of Owls at Chichen Itza (ninth century). The association between cacao pods and monkeys is a somewhat recurrent motif in sculpture, in the form of both statues and bas-reliefs (conserved at the regional museums of Tuxtla Gutierrez, Oaxaca, Pueb la, Tonina and Villahermosa). Maya funerary urns also bear the occasional image of cacao trees, pods, and frothy cacao beverages. The topic of offerings of cacao in the form of fresh pods or beverages is illustrated in Mixtee dynastic manuscripts and in the rare surviv ing codices dealing with Maya or Mexica divination. 66 Tlaltecatzin Timothy Ades Valentine Tibere</page><page sequence="3">On the other hand, there are numerous representa tions of cacao as currency in colonial codices that take stock of tributes paid by cacao-producing cities to the Spanish Crown. The latter feature roughly sketched pictograms of cacao baskets, with captions stating the amount of beans they contain. The dearth of cacao imagery, in comparison to that of corn and its god, has long stifled the efforts of researchers interested in this preeminent beverage of pre-Hispanic cultures. Sci entific articles published on the topic before the year 2000 are indeed scarce. Adapted since the sixteenth century to the palates of New Spain's rulers, the fla vorful drink blends Old World ingredients to temper the cacao beans' potency: milk, sugar and the Asian cinnamon that Mexicans are still so fond of. As the craze for this "fusion" chocolate has spread, it has rel egated traditional indigenous beverages to the wilds of cacao-producing regions. It is as though cacao, whose name likely originates from the Proto-Mixe-Zoque language once spoken in the cacao-producing regions of Tabasco and Soconusco, had to deny its origins to be deemed respectable. In terms of public awareness, we had to wait until 1996, when Sophie and Michael Coe published The True History of Chocolate, for the Mexican roots of chocolate to finally be broadly acknowledged. Examining oral traditions and colonial literature, the two anthropologists were the first to reveal to the av erage reader the great diversity of cacao-based bever ages and their role in Maya and Aztec rituals. And yet the two authors express their surprise at the innocuous depiction of the cacao tree in the Popol Vuh as a mere food plant. This manuscript, likely inspired in an illus trated codex, was rewritten in Mayan by seventeenth century K'iche' scholars using Latin characters. It is therefore not an original version: indeed, most codices were destroyed at the time of the Conquest. The Message of the Fish Beans that can be made into a beverage but also allow one to buy everything that is most valuable in New Spain cannot be anodyne. A discovery made in 1987 by epigrapher David Stuart revived the spirit of cacao after it had slumbered for five centuries. On the many cylindrical vessels accompanying Maya aristocrats into the hereafter, a fish motif with two fins insistently reappears. It forms part of a series of glyphs wound like a magic spell around the lip of ceramics from the Classic (150/200 CE - 900 CE) and Post-Classic (900 CE - 1520 CE) periods. Further research has revealed that the word had several components. Beginning as an incantation of creation, the "primary standard sequence"—using the scientific community's termi nology—subsequently lists a series of practical details, like a label: type of container, content, and finally the object's owner with his titles. As epigraphic research on funerary urns continued to progress, the glyph for cacao seemed to appear ubiquitously on Maya vessels. But why use a fish as a graphic symbol for cacao? Da vid Stuart (the author of Chocolate in Mesoamerica) put forth an initial technical explanation: the syllable ka, depicted as a fin in glyphic writing, derived from the Maya glyph kay, meaning "fish," and thus a fish, with two fins signifying the syllable should be repeated, is used to write the word kakavpa. In the specific context of vessels decorated with painted or engraved scenes, the cacao "fish" acquires an entirely new dimension, directly related to the tradition conveyed by the Popul Vuh, the wise men's "Book of Counsel." The decora tions on funerary urns indeed picture cacao trees, cacao beverages and twin fish in a jumble of images issuing from the dawn of time—from the same sources as the famous aforesaid manuscript. The Ahpu Hero Twins go through multiple metamorphoses, trad ing their human form for that of plants, animals or stars in a dream-like cinematic manner. In one of the saga's key episodes, the second generation of twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, come back to life, passing through a stage as fish in the underworld's primordial ocean. Some time before, the teenaged twins found the ball that had led to their father and uncle's premature deaths in Xibalba, the subterranean kingdom of the dead. They cannot resist the urge to play. The heavy ball makes the ground resonate when it bounces, and the noise annoys the lords of Xibalba who then chal lenge the young heroes to a game. Though the match is rigged, the twins outwit all the ruses of the gods of the "Place of Dread"; however, they are still sentenced to death. They choose to be consumed by fire. Follow ing their last wishes, their bones are then ground into powder as fine as cornmeal and thrown into a river. Five days later, they are reborn in the form of twin fish, and then turn into two handsome young men. Thanks to magic tricks, they then manage to kill the Gods of Death, forever establishing the victory of life. They resurrect their father in the form of the corn god, thus initiating the primordial cycle of seed to fruit, while they metamorphose once again and rise into the sky as the Sun and Moon (or Venus) in a final apotheosis. The Aquatic Twins Maya art photographer Justin Kerr has identified the im age of twin fish with barbels and black spots on a series of vessels. The aquatic twins evolved in the red waters of Xibalba—the kingdom of death as indicated by the glyph of the day kimi, "death," inscribed like a litany above the fish. The lethal blood-colored rivers of Xibalba are not mere legend: they do indeed exist in the tropics, ap pearing as a wine-red or orange tide caused by micro scopic algae that release compounds which are deadly to fish and toxic to humans who might eat them. The association between fish and an underworld perceived as abyssal seems very ancient, since the proto-glyph kimi (which resembles our percent sign) already appears in cised on Olmec ceramics. We can make out the outline 67</page><page sequence="4">of a second fish on one of the vessels he photographed, likely representing the Popol Vuh's aquatic twins. On an other bowl, the two fish form the death glyph, placed as they are on either side of a shorebird's long beak (see pages 22-2J). The aquatic twins, identified as catfish by Mayanists, thus lent their fins and undulating silhouette to the glyph for cacao, turning the Maya beverage into an elixir of resurrection. This ritual role is confirmed by the presence of fish on numerous ceramics discov ered at Maya royal burial sites, and is proved scientifi cally by the analysis of the contents of some of these funerary urns. The two most ancient vessels discovered so far have been unearthed, respectively, on the Pacific coast at Paso de la Amada in the Soconusco region, and on the Gulf coast at El Manatí in the state of Veracruz. The first, a Barra-style tecomate or ceramic jar dated to 1900 BCE is attributed to the Mokaya culture—fishers who became sedentary and built the world's first ball game. The other, a Chaya vessel dated to 1750 BCE, is sues from the pre-Olmec culture, considered to this day Mesoamerica's "mother culture." But why, among all the conspicuous marine animals that haunt the southern seas, were catfish in particular chosen to represent the aquatic twins? Fishermen in mangrove swamps know the answer: they are aware of the remarkable similari ties between this animal (called curuco in Tabasco) and humans. Its mustache-like whiskers, it smooth scale-less skin, its deep-slit caudal fin resembling spread-eagled legs, the fact some species can rival an adult human in size and weight—all these physical traits make it the aquatic equivalent of a human creature. And what about the noises it makes when taken out of the water? Growl ing, gnashing, warbling, the catfish noisily demands its catcher's attention by vigorously rubbing the spines on its pectoral fins against the body. To this singular talent— which allows catfish to communicate with each other in the murky waters of lagoons—we must add their innate ability to move on land supported by their fins. A catfish can thus go looking for water when its pond evaporates in the dry season, but it can also remain motionless for weeks, apparently dead, and then come back to life at the first rains. This rebirth, which defies all the laws of the animal kingdom is, however, common in the plant world, and the curuco indeed borrows this almost magi cal ability from the latter. So human in certain aspects, the "cacao fish" possesses powers of survival not unlike those of corn seeds, and indeed, according to Raphael Girard, it is the animal form or nahual of corn. With the rains, it rises from the mud of mangrove swamps like a seed sprouting on moist soil, an action rendered graphi cally by the cacao glyph's Tva syllable, which includes a spiral motif (or sprout) and a young leaf referring to nature's cycle of renewal after the dry season. In the Popol Vuh, it is the corn stalks—planted by the Hunahpu and Xbalanque in the middle of their house—whose ears sprout at the same time as the Hero Twins raise them selves from the dead. The Flower of the Ancestors On his stone sarcophagus at Palenque, Maya kingja naab' Pakal is depicted as a newborn, awaking to a new life at the foot of a supernatural Tree of Life. Placed ex plicitly under the sign of corn—one interpretation of his patronym Janaab' is "corn flower"—Pakal had boards strapped to his head during infancy to model his skull into a cob shape. As an adolescent, his headdress, crowned by feathers mimicking the plant's male inflorescences, evinced his affiliation to the Corn God, the "first father" of humanity, as Linda Scheie states. The king of Bak— the "Kingdom of Bones" in reference to the Maya city's ancient name—also claims to be the direct descendant of the first men created by grandmother Xmucane out of yellow and white corn. And yet his ancestors appear on the lateral panels of his tomb, their cinnabar-reddened bones sprouting like seeds in the moist darkness of Bak's funerary chambers. Transformed into fruit trees, they grow at the base of the Temple of Inscriptions—like the "resurrected stalks" of Hunahpu and Xbalanque in the middle of their house—as symbolic representations of the fruit trees growing near the actual monuments. The mother queen, Sak K'uk or "Gleaming Quetzal," has in turn become the ultimate royal tree: the cacao tree with evergreen foliage. Pods emerge from her shoulders and from a branch curving above her head. Next to her face, we see a bizarre flower resembling a fish whose round eye seems destined to stare into the tomb's darkness for all eternity. The allusion to the "cacao fish" seems obvi ous, even though the glyphic flowers look nothing like the cacao tree's actual inflorescences—tiny, white, and clustered against its trunk. They are so insignificant and odorless that only Maya scribes sought to examine them more closely. One must observe their tiny catfish-like silhouettes dancing across Pakal's sarcophagus or on the aforesaid set of vessels depicting the aquatic twins (see pages 24-25). Like the aquatic twins, their petals flap like fins, quiver like barbels or flair like a fishtail, tossed by the wind. Could they not also be the fragile image of the "white flower" of the Maya soul? K'ay u sak nik ik'il, "his white flower has wilted" says the ancient language to evoke death. The fish-flower's progress towards "flowery death"—a concept pushed to the extreme by the Aztecs—is accompanied by one of the word-and image games that are the very essence of Mesoamerican languages. To kaj or chaj, "fish," corresponds the verb k'ay or ch'ay, "to end," implying "one's earthly life." In the kingdom of Bak, at Palenque, the sacred mystery of the Popol Vuh is reenacted in the depths of the earth. Sak K'uk is Xmucane, 1-Hunahpu's mother, depicted in oral tradition as the creator of nine cacao-based beverages, some pure and some mixed with corn, as Dennis Ted lock states. Her son Pakal is fated to be reincarnated as the Corn God, as shown by the inscription engraved on his tomb. There is however another undoubtedly more ancient version of the myth in which 1-Hunahpu is at once the god of corn and the god of cacao, reincarnated 68</page><page sequence="5">as a cacao tree in Xibalba before being reborn as a corn plant on earth. He is also considered the inventor of the first chocolate beverages, according to Diego de Landa. The tradition of offering chocolate on small altars in the effigy of deceased relatives and drinking it on their tombs on November 2, the Day of the Dead, harks back to this myth. Fruits of the Tree of Life Upon its discovery, a Chama-style vessel now in the collection of the Popol Vuh Museum in Guatemala City revealed another aspect of the Tree of Life of Maya Genesis. This ceramic bowl from the Classic pe riod (150/200 CE - 900 CE) depicts 1-Hunahpu as a head hanging among a cacao tree's pods. The Popol Vuh describes a similar scene in detail, albeit with a different tree. According to the K'iche' text, the twin brothers, 1-Hunahpu and 7-Hunahpu, were the first to anger their neighbors of Xibalba, 1-Death and 7-Death, by spending their time bouncing their rubber ball. The lords of the underworld then challenged them to a match, cheated and won. They killed the losers and hung 1-Hunahpu's head from the fork of a dead tree at the place called the "Ballgame of Sacrifice." The dried-up tree immediately sprouted flowers, leaves and fruit—round calabashes as big as a human head that concealed the hero's skull from the eyes of the Xi balbans. These non-edible fruits can simply be emp tied out, dried and used as bowls. Calabash bowls are named "the skull of Hunahpu" in Mayan, according to Dennis Tedlock, and are used to drink chocolate. Highland Mexicas adopted the habit of drinking their chocolate in a calabash, and also the myth of the for est god with the severed head. Inverting the metaphor, they called the "head" tzontecomatl, "calabash with a mane of hair." The calabash tree and the cacao tree: their images are superimposed and interwoven in the story of the Tree of Life bearing "skull fruit," in the same way that the Yucatec Mayan word ich refers al ternatively to "fruit," "face" or "eyes." The calabash tree provides the sacred bowl, painted or engraved, for drinking cacao, which comes from a pod whose poetic expression in the Nahuatl language is jollohtli eztli, "heart, blood." Like a heart, the pod contains a warm, vital liquid. Its vegetal blood has the color of sun-dried beans ground on a metate—a grinding stone often made of very hard volcanic rock—and then toasted and added to water. The brown beverage can also be dyed a more or less intense red with annatto, a vermilion paste made from the aromatic seeds of the achiote tree. How could this blood be anything but divine? Could it not be the blood of Hunahpu and Xbalanque: the twins born of the union of 1-Hunah pu, the god-become-tree, and the beautiful, intrepid Xkik'? According to the Popol Vuh, the Gods of Death forbade anyone to approach the calabash tree—since it presented the shocking spectacle of life—growing on ,^T^; the outskirts of Xibalba. And yet, driven by curiosity, the young princess Xkik', the daughter of a lord of the underworld, sneaks up to the tree, tempted to taste its fruit. Hidden among the calabashes, 1-Hunahpu's head speaks up and tells her that the fruits are flesh less skulls. After Xkik' stubbornly insists, the hero's severed head tells her to hold out her hand, spits on her palm, and thus magically impregnates her. Six moons later, all of Xibalba finds out about the young woman's pregnancy. She is sentenced to death in ex ile. She does however manage to convince her execu tioners—the four owls of the Kingdom of Death—of her innocence, and takes shelter on earth where she gives birth to Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The seeds of the calabash tree of colonial times or those of the ca cao tree of the Classic period thus grow inside Xkik', appropriately named the "maiden of blood" ("sap" or "lineage"), referring to only one level of interpreta tion given the many meanings of her name, as Georges Raynaud mentions. In memoriam to 1-Hunahpu and Xkik', cacao was long a gift to newlyweds throughout Mesoamerica. Among the Mixtees of Monte Albán, the bride and groom drank a cacao beverage in the mar riage ceremony, while Diego de Landa reports that he witnessed the Yucatecs perform a kind of "christen ing" with spring-water, cacao and flowers. Nowadays, among cacao growers, a frothy refreshing drink called pozol made from grilled cacao and corn boiled with slaked lime is served at family celebrations, at the end of a lavish meal. In Tabasco, this same drink is served unsweetened, accompanied by small scallop-shaped fruits known as "monkey ears," candied lemons, and cajeta (sweetened caramelized goat's milk). The Twin Cobs Corn, the ultimate civilizing plant, is in turn pictured as the Tree of Life on a fresco in the Red Temple at Ca caxtla. Human heads resembling corn kernels appear at each node on the giant plant's stalk, but the cacao tree for which it stands is not far off. Against a red sky, it extends its roots in a magical river, which can only represent Xibalba. Bernardino de Sahagún was the first Spanish chronicler to note the resemblance be tween cacao pods and corncobs, both of which the Az tecs called centli or "cob." The corn "tree" has tightly packed kernels arranged cylindrically around the spike, while the cacao tree's pod also contains a "cob" under its skin and white pulp. The Hero Twins' saga revolves around the model represented by these two plants. They embody the sacred mystery of the oppo sition between two universes, the visible and the invis ible, the earth and Xibalba (the "hidden mouth" that swallows the dead), or, then again, the daytime sun and the "nocturnal" sun that disappears every night in the West for its voyage through the subterranean world. White corn and yellow corn, cacao andpataxte ( Theobroma bicolor, a species of the same genus as the</page><page sequence="6">cacao tree, yielding large, oily white beans) lurk just beneath the surface of the Hero Twins' saga. Corn, a solar plant, embodies light, resurrection on earth and the creation of humanity on Xmucane's grinding stone. Corn—or Santo Gracia as the ancients called it—is thus related to public ceremonies and the general recogni tion of "the people of corn": ancient and contempo rary Mexicans. Cacao, growing in the gloom, secretly represents rebirth after death, gestation and germina tion in the primordial sea, the breath of life, the word entombed. Corn is earthly, it is the substance of human flesh and its sustenance, but its double, cacao, contains the secret embryo of birth or rebirth. Chocolate is the ferryman that helps us cross over from death to life, that regenerates our forces, that reawakens the slum bering spirit, that makes women pregnant, that revives the dead. A red, black and light-ochre chocolate bowl provides a magnificent illustration of this vocation of cacao. It shows a figure lying on his back at the bottom of a body of water with his nahual, a large catfish. His cold flesh and silent mouth represent that in-between state where life has not yet vanquished death. But as in the Popol Vuh, from which this image is clearly in spired, magic does its trick and the bones ground into cornmeal become a fish and the fish becomes human; the two breaths of life become one, coalescing in a surprising mouth-to-mouth that brings the god back to life. Cradled by the blood-red waters of the under world, the Hero is in a fetal position, as his bones swell with life like seeds left to soak before planting. Now half-god and half-plant, he is intimately tied to the sowing and harvesting that explains his title of "first green corn [shoot] revealed," as Linda Scheie states. Further on, he appears as a teenage boy, standing, and very much alive. He is dressed by young women who prepare him for his return to earth as a corn "tree." This "First Corn" is an alter-ego of 1-Hunahpu, even though the resurrection pictured is his son's. The scene illustrated on this vessel remains a poetic metaphor. It does not depict the chocolate drinker, but rather al ludes to him: the fish-savior is identical to the fish of the cacao glyph painted on the bowl's lip, as M. J. Grofe notes, thus reflexively establishing a cause-and effect relationship between chocolate and the Hero's rebirth. The text of the Popol Vuh describes the exact same process: the twins jump into the fire, then their bones are ground into fine cornmeal and thrown into the water. It is as if it were describing the preparation of certain toasted-corn-based beverages (like pinole), or specifically that of most cacao-based beverages, in cluding mixes of corn and cacao (champurrado, pinole, pozol, tejate, chocolate). Not once is the word "cacao" pronounced: it has to be read between the lines, or to be exact, between the images of the two fish, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, referring to the cacao glyph. This way of conveying information through rebuses or word and image-games was not invented by the scribe who painted this vessel or even the authors of the Popol Vuh. It is known in Mayan texts as Zuyua Than, the "mean dering language." It is purely metaphorical and chang es the meaning of words to fool the non-initiated. This coded language reserved to kings and priests is said to have been taught at Tulan Zuyua, one of the mythic "cities of the reeds" (tolin) that exemplified the Meso american ideals of beauty and abundance. The Chilam Balam or "interpreters of Maya prophecies" disap peared long ago, taking with them most of the Zuyua language's secrets, while the rest still remains partially encrypted in glyphs and native languages. Until it was decoded, the "cacao fish" glyph meant nothing, ob scuring an essential part of the Hero Twins' message, and relegating the Popol Vuh\ twin cobs to oblivion. The World's First Tree A spectacular type of cacao pod is found in the Soco nusco; its shell has five deep vertical grooves and is covered with crocodile-skin-like bumps: it is indeed nicknamed "alligator (or lagarto) cacao" by botanists today. The pods' color is also peculiar, going from a pale pink streaked with yellow to an intense blood red. The crocodiles lurking in the murky waters of man grove swamps some miles from cacao tree plantations evoke the Aztecs' oldest ancestor, Cipactonal, whose name derives from Cipactli, "crocodile" in Nahuatl. When they recreated the world after the great flood, the gods made mistakes and appealed to the "guardians of days," Cipactonal and Oxomoco (Aztec equivalents of the Mayas' Xmucane and Xpyacoc). The two oracles were so old that they already existed when the earth rose out of the primordial sea like a crocodile surfac ing in the swamp—or more exactly like the mound of mud and leaf debris that the reptile forms with its tail to lay its eggs. The dawn of time in Mexico and Cen tral America coincides with the invention of the sacred calendar or tonalli used to predict the future. The first of its twenty days is "crocodile day": Cipactli in Na huatl and Imix in Mayan. The name Cipactonal is thus easier to understand in reference to the sacred calen dar. Returning to the Maya mangroves, observers have noted that once the crocodile eggs have hatched in the mound, a bush begins growing on it as the living im age of the primordial tree that colonized the earth and allowed it to achieve victory over water. The new shoot thus becomes a symbol of the Tree of Life that connects the three worlds, the subterranean world of virgin wa ter, the earth and the sky. The plant equivalent of the alligator in the Mexican tropics is an enormous tree, the ceiba or imix che, Mayan for "tree of the first day." Its branches touch the sky, reaching over 100 feet in height. Its roots twist like the clawed paws of a giant alligator and its trunk is covered in large conical spines resembling the reptile's grid of dorsal plates. An exact depiction of this is engraved on stele 25 at Izapa: the cosmic monster's hind legs form branches, while its 70</page><page sequence="7">jaw and front legs with five claws represent the roots. At a different time and place, the image of the alligator tree reappears under a different but essentially identi cal guise: at Chichen Itza, on a keystone of the High Priest's Tomb, an alligator sets its maw and anthropo morphic leg on the ground to represent, in this case, a cacao tree's root. In turn, the alligator-cacao tree reappears in the sixteenth-century Féjerváry-Mayer Codex, which shows four different cosmic trees asso ciated with the Aztec calendar. Here, red cacao pods replace the ceiba's spines, leading us to think that it is a depiction of the "alligator cacao" tree. Its last known depiction bears the form of a Catholic cross covered in blood-red pods. The plaster fruits are studded, like the alligator variety of the Soconusco. But let us rotate again the kaleidoscope of the primordial tree: the corn "tree" is also a reptile. It already appears in Olmec cul ture as the primordial tree guarding the four cardinal points and the axis mundi. Ceiba, cacao tree, corn: each of these trees of the world of circulating energies of life and death are connected by a single image, ixim, the "cob," a distorted echo of imix, the "alligator" (Si mon Martin links the two words in relation to cacao and corn). The ceiba's fruit, a cacao-pod-like ovoid capsule, actually contains a "cob" of seeds surrounded by kapok, a fluffy aerial version of cacao's moist pulp. The bulrush or cattail, tol in Nahuatl andpub in Ma yan—which lent its name to the city of Tula or Tollan, and to the Popol Vuh\ Hero Twins, as Linda Scheie has noted—also has a woolly cob quite similar to the ceiba's. The Aztecs' legendary city of Tula indeed refers to the myth of Quetzalcoatl: the god who sowed cacao seeds in Tabasco before metamorphosing, like the Popol Vutis twins, into the planet Venus. The Tree of Life with showy pods comes out of the shadows. Recent archaeological discoveries high light the qualities of a "people of corn" and of ca cao who prepared the first chocolate beverages with the emergence of the Mokaya culture on the Pacific coast of Chiapas +000 years ago. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, cultivators can once more hope to keep their ancestors' forests alive, along with their cacao trees, thanks to the international demand for fine chocolate. In Chiapas and Tabasco, producers have begun replanting rare heirloom varieties such as the legendary cacao real (royal cacao) of Soconus co. Since 2005, visitors to Villahermosa can travel a historic route that takes them from pyramids to ca cao plantations. Ecotourism has been developing in the Soconusco's cacao ranches and virgin mangrove forests, which saw the birth of the Popol Vub\ Hero Twins. Now that Mexican cuisine has been added to the list of the UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heri tage, restaurants and market stalls pay greater hom age than ever to the sumptuous turkey in chocolaty mole sauce from Puebla or Oaxaca or its more popu lar version, savory black mole enchiladas. It is also becoming increasingly easy to find traditional cacao beverages. Once again, the hearts of the cacao cob and the corncob beat in unison. There is a Mayan ex pression that refers to it, puc&lt;¡ikal Yxim, which could be translated as "the soul, the vibration of grains." © Translated by Richard Moszka. DECIPHERED SEED The Maya: the First Chocolate Scholars J.M. Hoppan For those of us attempting to understand the great adventure of civilizations, the legacy of the ancient Maya to the world's cultural heritage can only seem ex traordinary. The history of chocolate is but one example of this legacy among many others. Though nothing proves that the Maya invented the culture of cacao or indeed this plant's name, it can nonetheless be stated beyond a doubt that Classic-pe riod Maya scribes were the authors of the oldest writ ings on the subject we know of today. Their surviving inscriptions show us that the word kakaw existed in Mayan since the Early Classic period (150/200 CE-900 CE), that is, in around +00 CE. Moreover, the glyphs of Maya inscriptions are the only proof we have of this term's existence before the arrival of Europeans in America in the sixteenth century. There are several reasons behind this specific ity. The main one is that, of all the native peoples of America, the ancient Maya were the one who did the most writing. Furthermore, their socio-political orga nization from the fourth to the ninth centuries led, in a spectacular fashion, to an ostentatious use of writing. Among the elites, the tendency to display glyphs was even evident on their fine crockery. However, over the Preclassic period (2500 BCE-150/200 CE) and until the third century, Maya writing was mainly engraved upon stone monuments or incised into semi-precious stones used in jewelry; ceramics, including high quality items, were then still very sparsely decorated. Beginning in the Early Classic period, lavish decora tions as well as inscriptions covered the sides of a great quantity of finely made bowls, small cylindrical vases and other medium-sized containers used for liquids. At the end of the twentieth century, the decipherment of many of the inscriptions painted or engraved upon these vessels revealed a recurrent dedicatory phrase. This phrase served to show that these prized objects had belonged to some eminent figure, and, inciden 71 J.M. Hoppan</page><page sequence="8">tally, to point out their usage by indicating what kind of food or beverage they were meant to contain. Epig raphers thus noticed that, introduced by a sign of the preposition "for," the glyph indicating the kind of bev erage the object was meant to contain was preceded by a glyph meaning "...'s bowl"—literally, "...'s drinking instrument"—followed by a list of the owner's names and titles. The entire inscription thus seemed trans latable as "'such-and-such a figure's' bowl for 'such and-such a beverage.'" At first most commonly observed in the region of Tikal (in the Peten department of present-day Guate mala), it was demonstrated that a specific type of glyph referring to the content of a bowl could be read syllabi cally as ka-ka-wa, or kakaw, "cacao." This glyph had been described in 1973 by American researcher Michael Coe, who had named it "fish" because its main sign ac tually represented a fish. The meaning of this sign was definitively established in a study published in 1988 by David Stuart, based on an extraordinary discovery made a few years earlier in a tomb at the Río Azul site (also in the Peten). It was a ceramic vessel bearing the fish glyph, which had remained hermetically sealed since the burial of its owner in the fifth century; its liquid contents were therefore exceptionally well pre served. Traces of theobromine found through chemi cal analysis of the liquid after the container was opened showed beyond doubt that it was chocolate; tea, which also contains this alkaloid, was unknown in pre-His panic America. Work to reconstruct the Mayan syllabary, under going rapid development at the time, also established that the first of three signs composing this cacao glyph was a grapheme that Spanish clergyman Diego de Lan da had read as the syllable ka (then transcribed as ca) in his Mayan "alphabet" of 1566. This first sign further represented the minimal form of the sign for "fish." It visibly depicted fins and perhaps also scales, according to the principle of representing the whole by a part, com mon in Mesoamerican writing systems. Moreover, this syllable probably derived from the word kaj, meaning "fish" in Mayan. The second sign, the main one, was the depiction of a fish, read ka (derived from kaj as we just explained). The glyph's third and last sign referred to corn, whose syllabic value wa probably derived from the word waaj, "(corn) flatbread, tamal (and then tor tilla)." Thus, the glyph was composed of two ka syl lables followed by the syllable wa. Since the "a" in wa (like all final syllables in Mayan) is not pronounced, the glyph reads kakaw. The position of the surrounding glyphs, which often introduce the "fish" glyph, suggests that their function was to clarify how the cacao beverage was prepared in each case. The series of glyphs on the Rio Azul "cacao bowl" has not been completely decoded to this day\j-uk'ib ta-mtik kakaw ta-kox-1 kakaw, "...'s bowl for '?-cacao,' for '?-cacao.'" On the other hand, on a three-legged lidded ves sel from the same period discovered in the tomb of king Yax Nuun Ayiin I (379 CE-+0+? CE) at Tikal, the sequence is better translated and refers to a cornmeal based chocolate beverage known as atole still com monly drunk in Mexico today: j-uk'(db) [td-]sa' [ka] kaw, "...'s bowl for 'cacao-atole.'" A similar vessel that also belonged to the king and was discovered in the same tomb bears a sequence not unlike the Río Azul "cacao bowl." Though it has not been entirely decoded, according to current hypotheses, it may refer to "fresh" chocolate—unripe cacao pulp?— or to cacao flavored with a clerodendrum ligustrinum, a bush from the mint family: j-uk'(db) td-tsi[h-tel]? kakaw, "...'s bowl for 'fresh cacao'" or alternativelyj uk'(db) td-[i]tsi[(m)-telJ? kakaw, "...'s bowl for Htsin te-cacao.'" Many ceramics dating from the Late Classic pe riod (seventh and eighth centuries) bear more devel oped versions of this sequence that may indeed suggest that corn went into the preparation of this chocolate, unless, according to a different interpretation, it re fers to its fruitier flavor. This is the case, for instance, of a cylindrical vessel belonging to king Jasaw Chan K'awiil I (682 CE—734 CE) which was discovered in his tomb at Tikal:j-uk'ib td-j-uta[l] tsib-tel? [ka]kaw, "...'s bowl for cornmeal-/fruity? 'fresh cacao'" orj uk'ib td-j-uta[l] [i]tsi(h)[-tel]? [ka]kaw, "...'s bowl for cornmeal-/fruity? 'itsinte-ca.ca.0.'" Other glyphic sequences refer to this beverage as frothy, for instance, on a bowl belonging to king Aj Wosal (54-6 CE-615? CE) of Naranjo:j-uk'ib(db?) ta-j-utalom?-kakaw, "...'s bowl for cornmeal-/fruity? 'frothy? cacao.'" Other inscriptions yet refer to the beverage's "yellow" (and therefore also precious) color ("like ripe corn"):y-uk'ib ta-j-uta[l] k'an kakaw, "...'s bowl for cornmeal-/fruity? 'yellow/precious cacao.'" These phrases appear mainly on ceramics, although inscriptions on monuments sometimes also refer to ca cao. This is the case of "Lintel 3" at Piedras Negras (in the Peten) which makes reference to a ceremony dur ing which chili-flavored chocolate was imbibed: uk'in t(a)-ikal? kakaw, "'chili?-cacao' beverage." Classic Mayan epigraphy further employs the "fish" glyph not only to refer to chocolate but also to the payment of taxes with cacao beans. In fact, they were the principal medium of exchange in ancient Me soamerica, where metal coins did not exist. This can be seen on the western wall of Room 1 of the Temple of Paintings at Bonampak (Chiapas, Mexico), where a bag set at the foot of a throne bears the inscription "fivepik [of] cacao" (or 5 x 8000 = +0 000 beans). In the context of almanacs forecasting future events, as in the case of the Dresden Codex written several centuries later, the glyph is also used in pre dictions related to when certain gods come under the</page><page sequence="9">influence of certain calendrical signs—periods known as "entering [their] cacao [phase]," meaning "becom ing wealthy" or "prosperous." Interpreted as the glyph for cacao in 1972 by J.E.S. Thompson (though he then read it as kakabii), this Postclassic version is unlike the aforementioned "fish" in that its main sign is simply a ca (as read by Landa). Whether or not they actually invented chocolate, the Maya were still the first people in the world to write about it in fascinating accounts that allow us, in turn, to talk about it and to continue dreaming about it to this day... © Translated by Richard Moszka. STATUS SEEDS Cacao in the Maya World: Feasts ana Hituals Philippe Nondedeo «ver the last twenty years, thanks to new stu dies and discoveries, particularly in the fields of paleobotany, archeology, epigraphy and geoche mistry, we have witnessed spectacular developments in research on cacao Qk.ak.aw), leading to a better un derstanding of its social, economic and political role, and to a better appraisal of its true place in Mesoa merican societies and their mythologies. Today, we can precisely measure the importance and the role of cacao in these civilizations, particularly among the ancient Maya. Up until the end of the twentieth century, three major sources of information were generally used to study cacao: ethnohistorical sources, codices and an thropological research on current populations. Ac counts by chroniclers at the time of European contact were the first to refer to the uses of cacao and to the contexts associated with its beverage form, chocolate. These sixteenth-century chronicles, written by Diego de Landa, Francisco de Burgoa, Diego Duran, Gon zalo Fernández Oviedo y Valdés and Bernardino de Sahagún, describe, among other things, scenes of ban quets and ritual feasts, in the Central Mexican highlands as well as on the Yucatan Peninsula, during which at tendees ate copious amounts of food (meats, tamales, fruit) and drank all sorts of beverages (some of them corn- and chocolate-based), while the master of ce remonies offered gifts and luxury items to his guests in order to establish alliances, build strong social ties and define a certain hierarchy between the various participants. Echoing these ethnohistorical accounts, indigenous pictographic documents, or codices—such as Madrid, Dresden, Mendoza, Fejérváry-Mayer, Nu ttall—also contain important information about ca cao, representing the cacao tree or describing certain rituals involving particular gods or goddesses in rela tion to cacao in all its forms. Recent advances in several fields, and especially in the development of chemical analysis, have allowed us to establish that cacao was introduced as early as 1900 BCE-1500 BCE and was used as a beverage on the western peripheries of the Maya region, notably at the very ancient Mokaya site of Paso de la Amada in Chia pas. Evidence of cacao use in the heart of the Maya region itself dates back to 600 BCE, at Colha, Belize, where chemical analyses performed on residues pre served inside ceramic containers found at burial sites showed traces of theobromine—a substance whose presence can only be explained by the fact that these vessels contained cacao-based beverage, since theo bromine, along with caffeine, is a constituent of cho colate and one of its clearest chemical markers. Mo reover, the shape of these vessels, commonly known as "chocolate bowls," is particularly well-adapted to the preparation of this beverage, since they have a lar ge opening at the top and a long narrow spout at the shoulder, with which liquid chocolate could be poured from one container to another from a certain height, in order to obtain the frothy, velvety, flavorful beve rage that the Maya enjoyed and that they described in inscriptions or depicted in scenes on painted bowls. Even though most of the vessels used for consu ming cacao beverages issue from burials, we now know that chocolate was primarily imbibed on the occasion of major banquets celebrating important events in the lives of the sovereign or of other important members of the elite. Events such as the celebration of marria ges (that is, the celebration of an alliance between fa milies), enthronements, the presentation of the heir or the celebration of military victories were the pre text for great feasts during which the event's organi zer offered his guests all sorts of luxury items, such as seashells, cotton blankets, bags of grain and the well-known containers used for drinking chocolate that were found in a large number of tombs. They are generally cylindrical polychrome vessels of greater height than width (see page 42) bearing a glyphic ins cription in a band around the lip. These containers were generally the work of re nowned artists belonging to the nobility, and like the one found at El Naranjo (Guatemala), they were so metimes decorated with a scene evoking the event ce lebrated. Received as gifts, they would subsequently be reused by the event's guests at smaller-scale feasts that they themselves organized, in order to show their pri vileged relationships with the sovereigns. The prepa ration of the chocolate beverage itself—an energizing, stimulating drink due to its theobromine—included 73 Philippe Nondedeo</page><page sequence="10">additives such as honey, cornmeal, annatto, vanilla or certain flowers that altered its flavor and consistence. However, if we are to judge by chocolate bowls' ins criptions, it was most commonly and popularly drunk in its pure form—tzih kakaw. The consumption of chocolate during social events thus lies at the heart of a system and of a so cial, political and economic strategy of establishing bonds between participants at these banquets. The guests became indebted to the host, and the scope of this debt was predicated on the items they had received as gifts. Depending on the host's wealth and the guest's social status, these items could even include what represents the ultimate gift: a bag of cacao beans. These beans were not always obtai ned directly from the plantation where they were harvested, but instead were often acquired as tri butes paid to sovereigns by their vassals and van quished enemies. Indeed, we should point out that cacao beans were considered a type of currency that could be exchanged for all sorts of goods, and tribu tes owed to the sovereign could be paid in the form of cacao beans, as shown in a scene in Room 1 of Structure 1 at Bonampak, where a bag containing approximately +0,000 cacao beans is set as a tribute at the foot of a royal throne (see page 4-3). Though the practice of feasts is documented since the Early Classic period (150/200 CE-650 CE) on ce ramics from the central lowlands—for instance, on a magnificent vessel from Río Azul—it became more common in the Late Classic period (650 CE-900 CE), as conflicts spread through the lowlands: conflicts that led to the establishment of complex strategies of al liance between polities and powerful elite families. This need situated feasts and the consumption of chocolate at the crux of social, political and economic activities, as each person involved attempted to offer lavish ban quets to show off his economic clout and sophistication. Cacao thus became exclusively associated with the art of paying court, demonstrated by the sophistication of the vessels used to imbibe it. Through these banquets, cacao formed part of a pivotal mechanism in Maya society: the principle of the redistribution of wealth, which allowed the elite to commandeer the services of people of lower rank by inviting them to the banquet, or then again to pay them for their services with gifts made on these occasions. Feasts thus permitted wealth to be redistributed from the heart of the city to its periphery, from the upper echelons of the hierarchy to its lower rungs. This boom in cacao consumption in the Late Classic period also took place in the Yucatan, even though this region as a whole was not actually a cacao producer due to its low humidity, lack of rainfall and long dry season. However, in specific environments, especially at the bottom of cenotes (sinkholes containing groundwater) where humidity always remains high in spite of climatic variations, researchers have found wild cacao trees and sug gested that the ancient Maya could have cultiva ted cacao there, though on a rather limited scale. In any case, references to cacao began to abound in the Yucatan—as in the rest of the lowlands—in the Late Classic. On the one hand, this is evinced by the Chochola style of ceramics that originated in the region of Xcalumkin and that is characterized by high-quality vessels made for ritual feasts bearing deeply engraved decorations; indeed, some of these vessels bear the standard phrase indicating their function as "bowls for drinking cacao." On the other hand, it is revealed in imagery relating to ca cao found more prevalently in the northern area of the Peninsula at Ek Balam, Chichén Itzá and Acan ceh on objects made of seashells, jade, stone or clay. However, the few cacao-related artifacts unearthed in the Yucatan cannot be compared to the consi derable number of cacao bowls found elsewhere in the Maya lowlands. Finally, cacao's close relationship to both the unde rworld and the afterworld partially explains why these cylindrical vessels containing chocolate-and-cornmeal based beverage accompany a number of important figu res in their burials. Indeed, cacao is associated with re birth in the afterworld, and the cacao tree, as the cosmic tree, serves as a point of reference to guide the deceased from the subterranean world to the heavens: the land of deified ancestors who will be reborn as anthropomorphic trees associated with fertility—like the ancestors of Pakal, the great king of Palenque, depicted on the lateral panels of his stone sarcophagus. But we also find cacao solids (in powder or sauce form) at certain burial sites, such as the funerary chamber of the wife of K'inich Yax K'uk' M'o, the founder of the Copan dynasty. The remains of freshwater fish linked to a cacao-based preparation, as well as of what may have been tamales mixed with cacao residue suggest that chocolate-based (mole-type) sauces garnished meats or other dishes, as certain scenes on the vessel on page 4-4- seems to represent. Moreover, chemi cal analysis of the residue of some of the chocolate-based preparations in the aforesaid funerary chamber revealed traces of cinnabar and hematite—two volcanic minerals that the Maya ground to produce a red powder. This sug gests, on the one hand, that these dishes were not meant for the deceased queen's voyage to the hereafter, but were rather supposed to be her sacred nourishment once she became a deified ancestor. On the other hand, these chocolate-based foodstuffs, which in themselves repre sent the height of culinary sophistication, were rendered even more sacred by the addition of precious cinnabar powder, customarily dusted over the corpses of Classic period nobles. With this brief overview of the archaeological contexts and artifacts associated with cacao and cacao beverage, we may glimpse the central role it played in 74</page><page sequence="11">the society and the mythological-religious universe of the Maya. Ultimately, to this agrarian civilization, ca cao was a plant of secondary importance since it was not a dietary staple; however, because of its social role in banquets and its associations with the underworld, fertility and womanhood, cacao—along with corn was one of the most significant plants in the ancient Mayas' social imaginary. © Translated by Richard Moszka.

COMMERCIAL SEED The Cliocolille Trade in Mexican Territory: from Aztec to Colonial Times Nikita Harwich The Aztecs' conquest of Maya polities in the south of present-day Mexico—undertaken between the twelfth and the late-fifteenth centuries—first brought them into contact with the culture of cacao and chocolate beverages. This culture then spread pro gressively thanks to Nahua merchants and colonists. Territories along the Pacific coast, like the kingdom of Nicoya in present-day Costa Rica or the lowlands of Colima in Mexico, were considered newly valuable assets, attesting to the growing craze sparked by the fruit of the cacao tree. An ideal medium of exchange, the cacao bean was also accepted as legal tender throu ghout Central America; it lent those who traded it the status of bankers and luxury goods merchants. Given both their intrinsic and symbolic value, cacao beans soon became a tribute that the conquerors demanded from the populations they had subjugated; the beans were stored in special warehouses as a highly prized component of the treasure of the new lords of Anahuac (the Nahuatl name for Mexico's central highlands). The amounts delivered were appraised according to a system undoubtedly inherited from the Maya: the standard measure, translated into Spanish as the carga or "load" that a man could carry on his back (approximately thirty kilograms), consisted of three xiquipilis of 8000 beans each, or 2+ 000 beans. The xi quipil, in turn, consisted of twenty zontles of +00 beans. According to the Mendoza Codex, the total annual tax imposed by the Aztec Confederation at the beginning of the sixteenth century was 980 cargas, or slightly less than thirty tons. We can thus suppose that total annual production in the Aztec-dominated area was about ^00 tons. This production was concentrated, in the first place, in the polity of Soconusco on the Pacific coas tal plain at the foot of the sierra of Chiapas. Further south, the polities of Zapotitlan, Guazacapan and Izalco—on the border of present-day Guatemala and El Salvador—were also involved. To the north, on the Gulf coast of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the polity of Chontalpa, in the present-day state of Tabasco, was also a highly productive zone. Cacao beans grown there were sold as a commodity in markets in central Mexico. It was not subject to taxation, because unlike other ca cao-producing polities, those of Tabasco had escaped Aztec domination. There is no evidence that, following the Maya custom, the worship of the Aztec god of commerce, Yacatecuhtli, was associated with the ritual use of cacao. This does not mean that cacao beans played a less important role in Aztec society, either as curren cy or when processed into a chocolate beverage; in deed, Franciscan missionary Bernardino de Sahagún (1499-1590) states that during a banquet hosted by a merchant to celebrate his return from a trip, all the guests were given a kind of "chocolate kit": "They gave each noble two clay bowls, which they called ayo tectli, and one to everyone else. And together they gave two hundred cacao beans to everyone, as well as one hundred seeds of that plant they call teunacaztli, and a tortoiseshell spoon for mixing the cacao. This was done by all merchants when they came from afar." Moreover, contrary to the Maya custom of drin king it cold, the Aztecs imbibed their chocolate (which they called xocoatl) hot or lukewarm, something that enhanced the flavor of the various spices that were normally added to it and somewhat attenuated its bitterness: tlilxochitl (vanilla), pochotl (Kapok tree or Ceiba pentandra) seeds, several varieties of chili, and annatto as a coloring agent. Heating the beverage also allowed it to be thickened with the addition of boiled 75 Nezahualcóyotl, Nikita Harwich</page><page sequence="12">corn meal to thus obtain a kind of atole, which is still commonly drunk today. Even though chocolate was a luxury item whose regular consumption was restricted to the elite, the pre sence of cacao beans—mentioned by the chronicler Diaz del Castillo (1+95-1583)—in the stalls of the great market of Tlatelolco, the central market of the city of Mexico Tenochtitlan, seems to indicate a more generalized usage among the population, at least on special occasions. In this sense, it is important to distinguish between the kinds of cacao beans sold, whose price must have va ried depending on their size. Chronicles indeed point out the existence of four types of cacao tree, from the caca buaquakuitl that produced the largest beans, to the tlalca cahuahuitl or "humble cacao" whose smaller beans were preferred for making chocolate. The three other varieties were claimed to be more appropriate for "exchanges and contracts." Something else we must take into account is the time span over which beans fulfilled the function of currency. With their pulp removed, cacao beans can be conserved for long periods, but they remain perishable. Sooner or later, old beans had to be removed from circu lation and be turned into the raw material for chocolate. Did they retain their original value right to the end? The question remains unanswered. Intrigued by the use of cacao beans as currency, the Spaniards were soon determined to draw a profit from it, some time before they developed a taste for the chocolate beverage itself. Production was intensi fied, especially in the Soconusco region in Chiapas, in spite of the tragic consequences this had for the local indigenous population. Even then, steadily increasing demand soon outstripped supply. From the early se venteenth century to the end of the eighteenth, New Spain was by far the world's largest consumer mar ket for cacao and chocolate, swallowing up to around 3000 tons per annum (1790 estimate). The port of Veracruz thus became a hub for cacao bean imports from Central America and la ter, from the coastal valleys of present-day Ve nezuela. Venezuelan beans reached the markets of New Spain as early as 1620; by 1632, these exports had already risen to 2000 fanegas (around 110 tons) and then stabilized until 1650 at about 5000 fane gas (around 225 tons) per annum. Another increase in exports took place by 1670, firmly establishing Venezuela as New Spain's primary cacao supplier. Indeed, the Spanish Crown's primary concern was to maintain a tripartite payment mechanism: Ve nezuelan cacao exports were traded for silver cur rency issuing from Mexican mines, making up for Venezuela's lack of precious metals, and the cacao re-exported from Mexico to Cadiz was then tra ded for manufactured goods or foodstuffs (wine, olive oil, etc.) that were shipped back to the New World. This system maintained a balance of trade that minimized the need for withdrawals from the Crown's treasury in Madrid. Another development was that the indigenous workforce, which initially provided the manual labor on new cacao plantations following the traditional sys tem of the encomienda, was gradually replaced by African slave labor, perceived as better suited to the work condi tions. These slaves were often traded for cacao beans that Portuguese slave ships could then transport to New Spain or re-sell (for a profit) on the black market of Dutch- or British-ruled Caribbean islands. We cannot understand the broader context of the ca cao trade in New Spain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries without taking into account this last aspect, one that researchers have tried—so far in vain—to quantify precisely. According to the most reliable hypotheses, the black-market trade in cacao beans was at the very least equivalent to the total amount of duly registered ship ments. It was not only about circumventing the Spanish commercial monopoly: access to New Spain's markets was strictly limited to cacao produced in Venezuela, to the detriment of cacao from Guayaquil (in present-day Ecuador) due to laws that banned trade between Peru and New Spain, the two principal viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire in America. This situation could only encourage fraud and, for over a century, a considerable part of Guayaquil's cacao exports was covertly disem barked on beaches along the Pacific coast of Guatemala and Mexico, as evinced by the periodic re-imposition of laws outlawing the cacao bean trade. All sorts of sche mes, as well as a solid network of conspirators at every level of local administrations, allowed contraband cacao to reach New Spain's markets. One ploy was simply to secretly embark banned cargo on the rare ships that had a license to sail between Guayaquil and Acapulco. Another more ingenious scheme was the arribada-, a ship sailing for Panama was suddenly caught in a major storm and "accidentally" drifted to Acapulco—a case of force ma jeure confirmed by the (duly notarized) account of the entire crew. If the plot was thwarted, as sometimes hap pened, two-thirds of the illicit cargo, which still inclu ded an large quantity of cacao, was confiscated by and di vvied up among customs and court employees who then hurried to resell their share for a tidy profit. Finally, cacao trade networks further involved a whole slew of intermediaries: muleteers ensuring the transportation of bean sacks from production centers or ports to consumer markets; merchants in charge of receiving and loading the goods. As a highly speculative commodity—especially when it was smuggled—cacao did not only interest privateers haunting the Caribbean or Pacific Ocean, but also merchants, who were often additionally involved in the slave trade. In the seven teenth century, many of them were Portuguese Jews, as revealed by accusations brought against them by tribu nals of the Inquisition in Mexico. Though they were hunted down by Spanish authorities, they remained active in the region. Cacao was indeed highly lucra tive for those who traded it. Reviewing documents of the 1645-4-7 trial against Antonio Méndez Chillón 76</page><page sequence="13">of Veracruz—whose account books were confiscated by representatives of the Holy Office, and who was suspected of being a covert "Judaizer"—American historian Robert Ferry was able to determine that this merchant's profit margin on cacao imports from Ma racaibo, Venezuela was on the average 100%, something that undoubtedly more than compensated for the risks involved (though he was finally sentenced to deporta tion to the Iberian Peninsula). As a basic consumer product in all of New Spain, chocolate as a beverage was recommended in particu lar to workers whose jobs involved prolonged physical effort: thus, carters or coachmen drank at least two large cups per day The accounts of travelers confirm that the indigenous population usually drank the cho colate beverage cold, following ancient Maya custom, while mestizos preferred it hot. In both cases, it was a frothy, spicy preparation whose natural bitterness was tempered by the addition of sugar, demonstrating the beverage's heterogeneous character. Incorporated into dishes through sauces enlivening different types of mole, whether from Puebla or from Oaxaca, chocolate helped not only to fatten stomachs, but also to affirm the identity of an entire community. Paradoxically, though the cultivation of cacao continued to increase, especially in Tabasco, over the second half of the eighteenth century, New Spain and then Mexico—after it gained independence in 1821— never became self-sufficient. In the last decades of the eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth, exports from Guayaquil replaced the customary shi pments from Venezuela. However, by this time, the craze for chocolate beverage and then for chocolate bars and other confections turned Western Europe and the United States into the primary consumer markets of a product whose Mexican origins would now only serve to episodically kindle the inspiration of adverti sing executives in search of exoticism. © Translated bj Richard Moszka PRIMORDIAL SEED llomcKlimlioii: the American Origins of Cacao Nisao Ogata Keconstructing the past is a fascinating thing, especially when it involves investigating how and where biological diversity originated. However, evidence is either scarce or, even when plentiful, comes from a range of sources offering contradictory explana tions for a single event. In this process we seek out an ex planation that is simple, concise and quasi-irrefutable. This helps us build up a picture of the past, not by look ing for the explanation that most closely matches our evidence, but rather the other way around, by using the evidence to disprove all possible ideas until we are left with the least implausible—the idea or explanation that is hardest to deny. This becomes complicated when we try to reconstruct the origin and geographic distribu tion of plants manipulated by humans, mainly because it is often tricky for us in the present to understand why specific human groups selected certain traits in plants. And in regions such as the rainforests of the American tropics, this problem is exacerbated because the evi dence (seeds, fruit, leaves, etc.) disappears rapidly given the ecosystems' high humidity and temperature. Of the native species found in the rainforests of the American tropics, the cacao tree (Theobroma ca cao L.) is undoubtedly one of the most important. The cacao tree grows in the rainforest understory, and to survive it needs the right humidity, tempera ture, light, and altitude above sea level. Cacao, the raw material for chocolate, is the result of a sophisticated Mesoamerican agroforestry system that has existed since pre-Hispanic times in order to obtain the great est harvests from highly diverse ecosystems such as rainforests. Reconstructing the history of the origin, domestication, and distribution of cacao in the Neo tropic ecozone is particularly difficult: whereas in Mesoamerica the evidence is plentiful, further south where the species originated—such evidence is meager, especially regarding the historical use of cacao. Though we cannot be sure how the early inhabit ants of the Americas discovered that cacao seeds could be used to make chocolate, we do know that the Ol mec were already consuming it as a beverage. In 2011, anthropologists Terry Powis, Ann Cyphers and Nilesh W. Gaikwad and others found traces of theobromine in vessels unearthed at the San Lorenzo archeological site in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Cacao has a very particular chemical composition of over 500 different compounds, with theobromine be ing the key marker to identify its presence in pre-His panic artifacts. This study showed that the Olmec were using cacao in liquid form between 1800 BCE-1000 BCE. The Maya culture inherited this Olmec legacy. Cacao was entirely new to the Spanish. The first chroniclers filled pages with descriptions of how cacao was used as a currency, medicine, foodstuff, and above all as a delicious beverage that was highly valued by the indigenous elites. In this rebuilding of the past, some thing that most surprised twentieth-century histori ans was that, as the Spanish established their presence southwards toward South America, descriptions of Squirrel and spider monkey with cacao pods.

Was cacao not used by the south ern indigenous populations as it was in Mesoamerica? Or did these chroniclers simply tire of describing cacao when in Mesoamerica the information seemed so abun dant? The evidence supports the last of these explana tions, because there is far less archeological evidence in the South American rainforests than in Mesoamerica. Ethnographical studies of Amazonian settlements are relatively recent and from the little information available, the idea became widespread that cacao was not cultivated by South American indigenous popula tions. For example, Alexander von Humboldt gave this description in 1800 of a group of indigenous people in the Orinoco: "We met with no tribe on the Orinoco that prepared a beverage with the seeds of the cacao tree. The savages suck the pulp of the pod, and throw away the seeds, which are often found in heaps where they have passed the night." Various authors understood this to mean that the indigenous populations of South America did not use cacao as they did in Mesoamerica. However, we have found archeological evidence suggesting that between 1100 BCE—700 BCE cacao might have been used in the Jequetepeque Valley in the north of Peru, as evinced by a Tembladera-style ceramic vessel shaped like a tree, from which hangs fruit similar to cacao. This vessel also features small flowers that resemble the cacao tree's, as well as the image of spider monkey. De spite the Jequetepeque Valley's considerable distance from the rainforests where monkeys and cacao coexist, there is evidence of contact between the Peruvian coast and the Amazon region at least since 1500 BCE—900 BCE. We should recall that the spider monkey is an iconic symbol for Mesoamerican cultures for its rela tion to cacao, since it is considered the main disperser and carrier of the seed. In Maya culture, the spider monkey is the animal most commonly associated with cacao. It is highly likely that the vessel is a stylized rep resentation of cacao and of its disperser. In Mesoamerica, the cacao beans are represented by monkeys' backs, or even growing out of their bod ies. These depictions explicitly show spider monkeys as the providers and carriers of cacao, which is actu ally their role in the rainforests. The figure on page 78 shows a monkey with cacao in his hand and on his back, as well as small circles under the tail which could represent excrement as a possible explanation for the natural dispersion of cacao. The figure on page 77 not only shows a spider monkey but also a squirrel, a fel low disperser and consumer of cacao. One other piece of possible evidence relating to cacao in South America is a vessel now on display at the Larco Hoyle Museum in Peru. This artifact is dated to between the ninth and tenth centuries CE and comes from the Lambayeque Valley, a region just north of where the aforesaid Tembladera vessel was found. To date, no archeological traces of cacao have been found in Peru, though it is possible that future studies may furnish such evidence. In present-day Venezuela, meanwhile, there is evidence that cacao plantations existed on the arrival of the Spaniards (who promptly took advantage of this situation) and that at least the oil from cacao was used in reli gious ceremonies by the local indigenous population. There was also a beverage called chorote very similar to Mesoamerican chocolate, whose name apparently refers to the vessels used to drink chicha, an indig enous fermented-maize drink. When cacao production in Mesoamerica declined from around 1580, due to a labor shortage resulting from the decimation of the indigenous population, the Spanish supplied Europe from Venezuela, and the first contra band cacao shipments by English and Dutch privateers also came from this region. This provides circumstan tial evidence that cacao had been used in South America before the Spaniards' arrival, although its consumption cannot be said to have been widespread among the ethnic groups living in the South American rainforests, nor that it was put to the same use as in Mesoamerica. All this evidence begs the questions: Where did ca cao originate? And how did it arrive in Mesoamerica? The Theobroma genus is composed of twenty-two spe cies native to the American continent which grow only between the latitudes of 18° N and 15° S in rainforests where temperatures usually range between 20° and 30° C and with an annual rainfall of over 2000 mm. The eminent Spanish botanist, José Cuatrecasas (1903—1996), thought that the genus originated in the Amazon. After the Andes mountain range formed at the start of the Tertiary, some of the genus' populations were separated, aiding the evolution of new species due to isolation, such as the 77 cirmolinae, 77 stipulation, 77 chocoense and 77 nemorale which are distributed within a closely confined region between Panama and Colom bia, while others such as 77 cacao and 77 subincanum are found across the length and breadth of the continent. 77 subincanum is found on both sides of the Andes moun tain range, from Colombia on the Pacific coast to Brazil on the Atlantic. 77 cacao, meanwhile, is distributed from Colombia and Venezuela to southern Mexico, with pods exhibiting a remarkable range of shapes.

The distribution of Criollo populations stretch all the way from Venezuela and Colombia to Mexico. The presence of Criollo populations in Mexico has been mistakenly attributed to dispersion by humans without considering that cacao, like many other spe cies of tropical trees, has a very wide natural latitu dinal distribution—such is the case of Spanish cedar ( Cedrella odorata L.), breadnut (Brosimum aliscastrum Sw.) and jobo QSpondias mombin L.) trees. In our research into the origins of Mexican cacao, we analyzed populations of cacao found on the border of Mexico with Belize and Guatemala, in the Gulf of Mexico from Yucatan to northern Veracruz, and along the Pacific from Chiapas up to Colima. While exploring the largely virgin forests of the states of Chiapas, Campeche, and Quintana Roo on the border with Belize and Guatemala, we found wild cacao plants, which are usually found at a low density within the forest (three to five trees per hectare); the individual plants are thin, mea sure over eight meters high, and hardly produce any flowers or fruit at all. The Suma de Visitas de Pueblos, a series of reports dated between 1531-154-4 from 907 settlements across Mexico, itemizes the goods pro duced in each of the towns. We selected those towns that produced cacao in pre-Hispanic times but which now are no longer involved in any cacao-re lated activity. Of those areas, we found trees of pos sibly pre-Hispanic origin in various locations, from Colima to Chiapas and from the north of Veracruz to Yucatán. We compared, at a molecular level, the wild populations in southeastern Mexico with those cultivated from possible pre-Hispanic varieties and samples from South America. We analyzed the vari ation of a nuclear gene known as G}pdh (glyceral dehyde ^-phosphate dehydrogenase). We found that cultivated cacao trees of possibly pre-Hispanic ori gin distributed in Mexico came from the wild trees found in southeastern Mexico and not from South America. Cacao thus came to Mesoamerica as a re sult of its extensive natural distribution, but its use in the region derived from knowledge of the spe cies' qualities among Mesoamerican cultures, whose agroforestry systems are a legacy of a deep under standing of their environment —and these systems remain the best alternative for exploiting tropical rainforest areas. The paucity of evidence in South America prevents us from gaining a clear idea of the im portance of cacao in indigenous cultures there, yet the evidence suggests that cacao was also used in South America, albeit less intensively than in Me soamerica. Another factor that makes it harder to tell to what extent cacao was used in South America is the greater biological diversity and the impor tance of other plants found in that region: cacao's importance as a stimulant, for example, is minimal compared to plants such as coca (Erythroxylum coca Lam.) or powerful hallucinogenic plants such as Vi rola (Virola theiodora Spr. Ex Benth.). Nowadays, cacao cultivation is more extensive in Africa, where it was taken after the abolition of slavery in America. Latin American countries have lagged behind in global bean production. Cacao offers one of the best alternatives for the development and rational use of the humid, hot regions of the Neotro pical ecozone. In Mexico's case, and as a result of a long process of interaction between cacao and early cultures, varieties still exist that have barely been incorporated into programs for improving the spe cies and which could provide continuity to the legacy passed down from our ancestors. © Translated by Quentin Pope.

Ana María Luisa Velasco Lozano tells us that the Macehualtin (commoner) Mexicas used cacao for medicinal purposes, in the form of xocóatl, "to cleanse the mouth and relieve tongue calluses, as well as to fight uri nary illnesses, for which it was prepared with a root. Vanilla was added for those who could not keep food down." In his chapter devoted to "medicinal herbs," Sahagún mentions several plants that can be combined with cacao to make therapeutic medicines. The root of tlayapanolixihuitl was given "[for] little children who have diarrhea or stomach cramps, the root is to be mixed with five cacao beans. All is ground together." The tonacaxócbitl flower, ground up with the tlachichinoaxihuitl and mixed with water "is cooling. It is drunk so that a fever may leave, and it cleanses the urine. The tonacaxócbitl can be taken alone; it is added to cacao when drunk. Even though one be not sick, just healthy, one may drink it." The root of the tlacoxóchitl, ground and combined with wa ter: "Many times they add it to grains of maize, perhaps fifteen, or ten, and eight ca cao beans. They drink this [mixed with wa ter] during fasting or after food is digested, when sick or well. One who is very sick of body, feverish, panting, hence faint of heart, [with this] lessens the fever." Cacao is also ground with tlilxóchitl, ueinacaztli and the tail of the tlaquatl or tlaquatzin (opossum) and drunk for a cough, as a laxative, to in duce labor, to open the pores or to improve digestion. As a special diet for sick people, the chronicler says, "consume tortillas made of lightly washed corn kernels, toasted tortillas, cacao water and slaked lime." Francisco Hernández described the use of cacao as a cure for several illnesses. Drunk unaccompanied, it helped "to lessen heat and reduce the burning sensation of the grave ly ill, as well as being used for those with a fever from a liver ailment or any other or gans." It was also effective against dysentery, when taken with four roasted beans and an ounce of holli. It was refreshing and nutri tious by itself; when blended, with another plant added, it was good for "arousing sex ual appetite." Drunk warm, the beverage called chocó/atl, made withpóchotl kernels and cacahoatl beans, was effective against tuber culosis and exhaustion. In his Relaciones geográficas, Francisco del Paso y Troncoso says that in the town Alahuizt lan, "when they have blood in their stools, they consume a drink made from cacao husks, and it does them good." On the other hand, consum ing too much cacao was not recommended, as "it obstructs your innards, causes discoloration and may result in malnutrition or other incur able illnesses... The drink called chocólatl, made frompóchotl kernels and cacáhoatl beans in equal measure, is said to be extraordinarily fattening if taken too often." Sahagún says that "this ca cao, when much is drunk, when much is con sumed, especially that which is green, which is tender, makes one drunk [...] When an ordinary amount is drunk it gladdens one, refereshes one, consoles one, invigorates one." It has a similarly intoxicating effect with the addition of ground teonacaztli flowers: "Its scent is dense; it pierces one's nose; it is strong. It is yellow [...] the juice is extracted when it is drunk, or it is ground in cacao [...]. It is drunk not many times and not much; for it takes effect on one; it makes one drunk as if it were mushrooms."
