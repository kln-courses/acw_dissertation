The ancient art of Ceylon has hitherto been a badly neglected field of research. Though most monuments have been surveyed during the last hundred years, their chronological and stylistic analysis was hardly envisaged, because they seemed to be no more than a rather conservative and, on the whole, sterile reflection of art develop- ments on the Indian continent. It is, therefore, most praiseworthy that Professor Mode has at- tempted to reconstruct the development of Cey-</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 471 lonese sculpture, of its style as well as of its iconog- raphy. He rightly emphasizes that it has had a very distinct evolution of its own, and demon- strates this at the hand of a careful analysis of its various aspects: the stelas by the side of the dago- bas, their decoration of flower vases, yakshas (dwarfs), cobras, Ndgarajas with and without the water vessel or flower bunch, with or without architectural frame; the side pieces and "moon- stones" which form part of the flights of steps; the animal and anthropomorphic sculptures of doorways, platforms; the rock reliefs of Tisaveva, Mihintale, Issarasamana VihAra; the sculptures on the temples and palaces of Anuradhapura, Polonndruva, and other sites; and the statues of the sitting, resp. standing Buddha, Bodhisattvas, kings, etc. This sculpture is an expression of Cey- lonese religion, of the rather sober (mainly H!- nayanist) Buddhist theology superimposed on that layer of folk religion so well known from the "devil dances" and their terrible masks. That later the lion, almost as much stylized as in mediaeval European art, plays an important role, needs no explanation in the art of the "lion island." This sculpture is much less exuberant than that of India, remains subordinate to architecture and sticks to a very limited number of types. There is a clear ascendant evolution from pre-Christian times to ca. 300 A.C., a classical phase until the late Anuradhapura period, and a rather sterile imitative stage, without real plastic sensitiveness during the Polonnaruva period, not to speak of the later "folk style" art (which, too, has its own quaint charm). But although the development of all these types is different from Indian iconog- raphy, it is neither independent. Rather it is a process of selection and recombination both of elements borrowed from India, as well as of already long established and newly imported mo- tives. Nor can I see much difference in the sculp- tural feel, except that Ceylonese sculpture-like that of Greater India-has nothing of the explo- sive eroticism so characteristic for most of Indian figural art, instead a certain constant serenity alternating with a grotesque humour. One cannot help being incessantly reminded of the Indian prototypes which century after century helped to enrich Ceylonese art, prototypes adapted even from Hindu iconography (an interesting example the Buddha slab from Girabandu Vih~ra, adapted from a group of diva with Nandi, Pdrvat! and ganas). On the other hand one can neither deny the increasingly indigenous character of those types, since long incorporated into the national tradition. It is, of course, the tendency of modern Sinhalese nationalism to deny the Indian influ- ence as far as possible. And Professor Mode has gone far in accepting it. He has, thus, likewise tried to trace back the origins of Ceylonese art far beyond the Amardvat! school which hitherto has been regarded as the first inspiration. He may in- deed be right with regard to the stelas of the Kantake Cetiya at Mihintale and of the Dakkhina Thflpa at Anurddhapura. But unfortunately style parallelism is no conclusive chronological evi- dence, as experience has shown that the recipient art generally is later than its prototype, some- times up to two centuries. We are likewise justified in accepting the claim of the chronicles that the Ceylonese art tradition goes back to at least the second century B.C., and even to the introduction of Buddhism in the 3rd century B.C. But so far archaeological evidence is lacking, though this may be merely due to the absence of field in- vestigations with modern methods. However, I cannot regard this question of primary importance for our appreciation of Ceylonese art. For no art has originated without learning from many sides, as nationalism has always tended to claim. But likewise is every genuine art the product of a selective process determined by the national tem- perament, dominant ideas and ideals. Though one may disagree about minor details, this book demonstrates very well that selective and trans- forming genius which, notwithstanding so many inspirations from outside, has made Ceylonese sculpture a genuine expression of the Sinhalese character.
