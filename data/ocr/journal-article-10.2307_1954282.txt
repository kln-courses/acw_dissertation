<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCEPT FORMATION IN NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES: TOWARD RECONCILIATION IN POLITICAL THEORY ARTHUR L. KALLEBERG University of Missouri, Columbia Despite the fact that the study of politics has become increasingly empirical, quantitative and "behavioral" in recent years, and despite the ap- parently increasing tendency to feel that what- ever meaningful debate ever existed between the behavioralists and the anti-behavioralists has ended, should end, or at least has become irrel- evant since a more sophisticated and empirically productive behavioralism now predominates in virtually all fields of the discipline,1 the method- ological debate continues, diminished perhaps in quantity but not in intensity.2 This essay is based on the assumption that the antagonists concerned with the methodologi- cal issues raised by the "new science of politics" have but rarely focused precisely on the argu- ments raised by their opponents. A second moti- vating assumption is that nothing constructive, conciliatory or conducive to the integration of the discipline can be done "until the issues have been squarely confronted on the basic and gen- eral plane of philosophy....". A thorough anal- ysis of all of the meaningful issues involved can only be a task of long-range proportions. But in the hope of bringing about some degree of com- 'Robert A.

Indeed, it will be seen that the conflict be- tween the "traditionalists" and the "behavioral- ists" is utterly dependent-in the area of con- cept formation-upon an outmoded positivistic interpretation of behavioral science and a mis- guided reaction on the part of some political theorists to that obsolete conception. Concept formation as a general problem in philosophy, however, is extremely complex inas- much as it covers questions of definition, classi- fication, comparison, measurement, and empiri- cal interpretation. To achieve our immediate and ironic purpose, however, it is desirable to restrict the analysis to the questions of defini- tion and especially of the criteria of classifica- tion to be used in developing the basic concepts of political science, concepts of the attributes of political phenomena. Not only is it necessary to resolve this question prior to engaging in the questions of comparison and measurement, but it is primarily on this most basic level that it is possible to see most clearly the nature of the misunderstandings held by the antagonists on both sides of the controversy about a behavioral science of politics. Once we understand how we develop criteria of identity and classification, problems such as comparison become relatively simple on the conceptual level and permit us to concentrate our energies upon the application of our concepts and techniques to the data we wish to compare or measure. I. THE "NEW SCIENCE OF POLITICS": OVERT BEHAVIOR AS A PRINCIPLE OF CONCEPT FORMATION There are two extreme positions that have been taken regarding the nature of concept for- mation during the recent history of the social sciences. One is the view characteristic of the earlier forms of positivist and empiricist philoso- phy according to which "any scientific state- ment, however abstract, could be transformed, 26</page><page sequence="2">1969 CONCEPT FORMATION IN NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES 27 by virtue of the definitions of its constituent terms, into an equivalent statement couched ex- clusively in observation terms: Science would really deal solely with observables."4 As John Stuart Mill suggested, "the backward state of the moral sciences can only be remedied by ap- plying to them the methods of physical science, duly extended and generalized."5 For the pur- pose of scientific inquiry, at least, the behavioral political scientist in the eyes of his critics treats as non-existent all psychic phenomena, especially the valuing activities of human beings, and his concepts must be technical concepts, as remote from everyday, common sense constructs as possible.6 Arthur Bentley, of course, is the most em- phatic exponent in the recent history of political thought of the idea that the study of politics should confine its inquiry to "observables" or, as Herbert Hochberg puts it, to "overt behavioral patterns."7 "My epistemological point of view," 4C. G. Hempel, Fundamentals of Concept For- mation in Empirical Science (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), p. 24. The original state- ment of this is to be found in J. B. Watson, Behaviorism, Revised Edition (Chicago: Univer- sity of Chicago Press, 1930). Other contemporary philosophers of science describe early, or radical, behaviorism in this manner also. See Felix Kauf- mann, Methodology of the Social Sciences (Lon- don: Oxford University Press, 1944), pp. 148, 151; Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1961), pp. 476-477. 'Ernest Nagel, John Stuart Mill's Philosophy of Scientific Method (New York: Hafner Publish- ing Co., 1950), p. 307. 'This view of what is implied by the behavioral position is appropriate in regard to J. B. Watson's work, but not with respect to the work of contem- porary behavioral scientists. And even exponents of radical behaviorism, while rejecting introspec- tion as a research method, did not deny the exis- tence of conscious mental states. See Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science, op. cit., pp. 477, 480. This obsolete and incorrect view of what is implied by the behavioral position is dominant among critics of the "new science of politics." See Leo Strauss, "An Epilogue," in Herbert J. Storing, op. cit., pp. 310-320; Leo Weinstein on Bentley, pp. 154, 174, 188, 189, 220; Herbert J. Storing on Simon, pp. 112, 123-132. See also Henry S.

Bentley claimed, "is admittedly naive, as naive, I hope as the point of view of the physical sci- ences; I nowhere lay any stress on the differ- ence between the conscious and the unconscious. . ." ,2This statement, it should be observed, does not refer to the techniques of the physical sciences, or to the logic of scientific procedure in general. Bentley is stressing a particular way of looking at phenomena, a way of constructing concepts of the objects of inquiry in the science of politics. In a very general sense, Bentley's claim of epistemological identity with the physi- cal sciences is quite justified. The "viewpoint" of the physical scientist is indeed not that of in- trospection, and color and sound have no mean- ing in his explanations except in terms of wave lengths, which are theoretical constructs inter- preted in terms of the observed behavior of material entities. Theoretical constructs interpreted in terms of the externally observed behavior of humans is the similar goal of Bentley's political science. For Bentley, ideas and feelings, like color and sound, may be immediately experienced by 'sub- jects but cannot be the "raw material" of a sci- ence of politics. What, he asks, are "the practi- cal realities" for which these feeling and idea factors stand? . . .we readily see that they stand for certain regularities . . . in activity stated as individual conduct. For instance, if a child is kind to its cat it is apt to be kind to its dog. We indicate the tendency by calling the child kind-hearted. However, while these feelings and ideas put themselves forth to be definite dependable things, experience proves that they only conform roughly to the actual activity that can be observed . . . from the standpoint of the feelings we can observe nothing more than unreliable, poorly defined ten- dencies of activity to correspond to them. Kindness to cat or dog is not accompanied by kindness to snake or mosquito. When we get to the application of these feeling and idea elements to social interpretation, our dif- ficulties become greatly increased . . . The words commonly used for feelings and ideas break down, and for the social researcher ideas and feelings must be made so definite in meaning . . . . that they fit the facts of the case like shadows. . .. The concepts used by the social scientist must correspond not to the meanings imputed to 'Arthur F.

"If we can get our social life stated in terms of activ- ity, and of nothing else . . . we have at least reached a foundation upon which a coherent system of measurements can be built up."10 This is the position also of Charles E. Merriam, G. E. G. Catlin and other early proponents of behav- ioral political studies.1' Essentially the same po- sition has been expressed in more recent po- lemic. David Apter, for example, argues for the development of "research theory" that is based upon concepts not derived from common sense. "Much of what seems to be a maze of jargon in social science," he points out, "is a direct result of the effort to cut through so-called common sense terms which, upon intensive probing, prove themselves to be of limited usefulness."1 Apter feels that the epistemology that is implicit in most political research has been that of "his- toricism," or the attempt to discover the ideas of an historical period and the "structures" in which they are expressed.'3 The historical ap- proach, unfortunately, has placed undue em- phasis on the uniqueness of an age and therefore also on the idea that the age can best be under- stood through participation in "the social pro- cesses on one's environment." Contrary to this approach, Apter contends that "the only way in which questions can be phrased in terms of their maximum significance is to articulate the body of research theory to which the problem is rele- vant."14 This, in turn, can best be done by de- 10 Ibid, pp. 169, 184-185.

Catlin put it, "Politics must view social phenomena externally, considering without moral parti pris the appraisals of value and conventional estimates which it ob- serves that men, in given places or times, in fact entertain. . . .

II. THE "OLD POLITICAL SCIENCE": VERSTEHEN AS AN INSTRUMENT OF EXPLANATION At the opposite extreme from the radical be- haviorists, who maintain the thesis that concepts in the science of politics are to be developed by the observer on the basis of his perception of the overt actions of his subjects, are those who have argued in favor of what is usually called the "verstehen operation.'6 Until recently there was little question but that the term verstehen referred to an explanatory technique, the "method" of empathy, or to the intuitive impu- tation of motives to human agents other than oneself on the basis of one's understanding of one's own motivation. It is the attempt to "un- derstand" social behavior by imputing "springs of action" to the actors involved in it by means of an imaginative identification of the social scientist with the participants in the social situ- ation under analysis. The "external" observation of social behavior, of "patterns of action," from this point of view is at best extremely limited in applicability, and at worst utterly fruitless. The political and social sciences, it is argued, should not, or cannot, be molded along the methodolog- ical lines of the physical sciences. As Theodore Abel describes the "verstehen operation"'17 it involves the assumption that the social scientist has within the universe of his ex- perience feelings or emotions which he has sub- jectively correlated with certain behavior he himself manifested in the past. The social ob- server also associates, often but not always quite logically, certain groups of value concepts with others-for example, a value concept asserting the value of life might be associated with other attitudes such as, but not necessarily, pacifism, 15 Ibid, p. 757. "6 The most succinct analysis of this is given by T. Abel, "The Operation Called Verstehen," Ameri- can Journal of Sociology, 54 (Nov. 1948), 211-218. See also Maurice Natanson, "A Study in Philoso- phy and the Social Sciences," Social Research, 25 (Summer, 1958), 158-172. In political science the best-known proponent of verstehen as a necessary instrument of explanation in social science is Leo Strauss, Natural Right and History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953), pp. 50-59.

Then these feelings which are meaningfully associated with each other in the individual are used by him as an investigator to "explain" the behavior of others. In political science, Leo Strauss, expanding in large part upon the methodological position of Max Weber, agrees with him that human con- duct cannot be understood ". . . without being aware of the standard of judgment that is inher- ent in the situation and accepted as a matter of course by the actors themselves. .*..8 He draws a strong distinction between what he calls "the new science of politics" and the old, or Ar- istotelian, political science on the basis of several criteria, including the notion that ". . . Aristote- lian political science views political things in the perspective of the citizen [prior to judging or evaluating those various perspectives on the basis of ". . . a more comprehensive and a clearer grasp of man's natural ends and their natural order. . . ."] whereas the new political science ". . . looks at political things from with- out, in the perspective of the neutral observer ..1 ' '""Weber himself, of course, believed that verstehende was a method that enabled the so- cial scientist to avoid injecting value judgments into his studies by accepting the self-interpreta- tion of his subjects in the construction of ideal types to be utilized in explanation. For Strauss, however, this aspect of Weber's approach cre- ates a corrupt methodology for the social scien- tist, for he then falls "victim to every deception and every self-deception of the people one is studying. ..."20 This is also the position taken by Eric Voegelin, David G. Smith, Charner Perry, Harry V. Jaffa, Henry S. Kariel, to a lesser extent Bernard Crick and, with the em- phasis upon methodological as opposed to histor- ical relativity, by Robert M. Barry.2' From this "Leo Strauss, op. cit., p. 54. 19 Herbert J. Storing, op. cit., p. 310.

In trying to avoid value judgments, Weber merely developed his analyses on the basis of the conceptual frame- work of his own society, his own historical mil- ieu. Such historical relativity vitiated Weber's attempt to achieve a value-free social science. Verstehen, coupled with the desire to avoid the corruption of historical relativity, forces the so- cial scientist, qua scientist, to make value judg- ments of a moral kind. This position is also part of the broader methodological stance taken by Robert M. Mac- Iver, who has argued that the verification of hypotheses in the scientific study of politics takes place on two levels. First of all, statistical analyses and related techniques are to be em- ployed to determine whether and to what extent the phenomena under investigation are asso- ciated with other phenomena. All hypotheses must pass those tests before they can be consid- ered for further study. Those hypotheses which meet this requirement must then be analyzed on the second level, where the political scientist tries to discover whether the association or correlation is meaningful. At this level the evi- dence is ... the depositions, avowals, confessions, justifi- cations, and other testimonies offered by agents, participants, or witnesses, professedly or ostensibly giving their own answers . . . to the question of causation . . . We must here essay the task of pro- jecting ourselves by sympathetic reconstruction into the situation as it is assessed by others... . An even more radical criticism of the idea of a strictly behavioral science of politics that is based on the notion that common-sense criteria determine the concepts of the study of politics has been put forward by Charner Perry. It is more radical because it assumes that the appli- cation of the scientific method to a given subject matter cit., pp. 120-122, 126, 128-129; Robert M.

MacIver, Social Causation (Boston: Ginn and Co., 1942) pp. 390-391. The dependence of the political theorist on "self-awareness and intro- spection" is asserted also by Norman Jacobson, "The Unity of Political Theory: Science, Morals, and Politics," in Roland Young (ed.), Approaches to the Study of Politics (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1958), p. 120, and David G. Smith, op. cit., p. 742.</page><page sequence="5">30 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 63 . . . involves a transformation of the subject matter, a substitution of one point of view and set of terms for another . . . briefly, for the common sense universe of discourse . . . there must be sub- stituted a system of terms, concepts or categories which abstract from human purposes, needs and ideals, in Veblen's terms, concepts which disclose a 'colorless impersonal sequence of cause and ef- fect.'23 Because in social behavior language is not merely an instrument, external to the behavior, "but is rather the essential stuff or structure of the behavior, .". ."24 common sense is teleological and anthropomorphic whereas science, though it originates in common sense, ". . . in its explicit theory . . . uses terms and distinctions which are detached from reference to human desires, needs, or activities."25 This difference, according to Perry, makes it impossible to apprehend so- cial behavior in the categories necessary in sci- ence. While there have been many attempts to describe social action in terms appropriate to natural science, especially in recent years by the behavioralists, Perry considers them all ". abortive because the distinctions and preconcep- tions of common sense have quickly reimposed themselves even when mutilated by a strained terminology."26 Taking the position that he does, it is necessary to stress the fact that Perry is not in his own eyes arguing for the subjective character of political inquiry. He often speaks of the "knowledge" and "facts" we have of political behavior, and toward the end of his analysis he specifically raises the question, How do the terms of social science have objective reference? He answers, however, in terms similar to those of the other critics of "the new science of poli- tics," for he believes that to describe behavior adequately one must do so in terms of norms, in terms of the purposive activity involved, in terms of the common-sense perspective of the agent.27 III. VERSTEHEN AS A PRINCIPLE OF CONCEPT FORMATION Among philosophers the meaning of the term zerstehen is still at issue.28 That interpretation 23 Charner Perry, "The Semantics of Political Science," op. cit., p. 398. 24 Ibid, p. 395. 25Ibid, p. 397. 2 Ibid, p. 399. 2T Ibid, p. 406. 28 See, for example, Thelma Lavine, "Note to Naturalists on the Human Spirit," Journal of Philosophy, 50 (February, 1953), 145-154; Ernest Nagel's criticism of Lavine's position in his article, "On the Method of Verstehen as the Sole Method which treats it as referring to how one knows or explains the motives of others, that is, to intu- ition as an instrument of scientific explanation, has been increasingly called in question. Verste- hen, to philosophers who hold this view, such as Nagel and Hempel, is considered to be a subjec- tive process because they hold that understand- ing the motives of another man's action by means of this procedure depends upon the pri- vate, uncontrollable, and unverifiable intuition of the observer. Recent criticism of this view emphasizes an aspect of the concept verstehen that is most significant for the problem of con- cept formation. It also brings the concept closer to its usage as originally established by Max Weber. Contrary to Nagel and Hempel, one critic as- serts that "social scientists, such as Max Weber . . . call Verstehen subjective because its goal is to find out what the actor 'means' in his action, in contrast to the meaning which this action has for the actor's partner or a neutral observer."29 Verstehen literally means simply of Philosophy," Journal of Philosophy, 50 (1953), 154-157; and Lavine's reply, "What is the Method of Naturalism?" Journal of Philosophy, 50 (1953), 157-161. A year later Carl Cohen joined the debate with an article on "Naturalism and the Method of Verstehen," Journal of Philosophy, 51 (April 1, 1954), 220-225. 29 Alfred Schutz, "Concept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences," Journal of Philosophy, 51 (April, 29, 1954), p. 265. Underlining added. Schutz further observes that the controversy about verste- hen ". . . suffers from the failure to distinguish clearly between Verstehen (1) as the experiential form of common sense knowledge of human affairs, (2) as an epistemological problem, and (3) as a method peculiar to the social sciences." Type (2) represents the way the critics of verstehen deal with its meaning, that is, as a problem in how we know, in general, viz., by intuition or by observa- tion. Type (3), on the other hand, assumes that the logic implicit in the physical and the social sciences is the same, and treats the term as refer- ring to a problem in method peculiar to the social sciences. That is to say, granted that the logic of all the sciences is the same, nevertheless, social reality, the "object of inquiry" in the social sciences (interaction, intersubj ectivity, language) requires a method of observation (and therefore a type of concept formation) suitable for those objects, a method that observes actions as they are meant by the actors and not that observes actions with meanings imposed by the observer. See Max Weber, The Theory of Social and Eco- nomic Action (Glencoe: Free Press, 1957), pp. 9, 18, 22, 90, but esp. p. 88; Talcott Parsons, The</page><page sequence="6">1969 CONCEPT FORMATION IN NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES 31 to understand or to comprehend, and thus both usages are plausible. The interpretation of the term by Schutz, however, stresses the goal, or object, of understanding-the actor's meaning -rather than the process of understanding in the mind of the observer.30 This revised interpretation of verstehen, by treating the "subjectively intended meaning" of an action as a problem in concept formation within the social sciences rather than a problem of how we know in general, by intuition or by observation, makes it possible for proponents of the necessity for taking the meaning of action into account to agree with the logical positivists about the nature of the logic of the social sci- ences. Schutz, for example, agrees with Nagel that all empirical knowledge depends upon dis- covery through processes of controlled inference, must be capable of being verified by anyone who will execute the proper experiment, and that any method that would require the scien- tific observer to select and interpret facts in terms of his private value system would never produce a scientific theory.31 Nevertheless, he submits that to the best of his knowledge no social scientist of stature . . . ever advocated such a concept of subjectivity as that criticized by Professor Nagel. \'ost certainly this was not the position of Max Weber." And he goes on to assert that Nagel and Hempel . . .are prevented from grasping the point of vital concern to social scientists by their basic philoso- phy of sensationalistic empiricism or logical posi- tivism, which identifies experience with sensory observation and which assumes that the only alter- native to controllable and, therefore, objective sensory observation is that of subjective and, therefore, uncontrollable and unverifiable intro- spection.32 This identification of experience with sensory observation in general and of the experience of Structure of Social Action (Glencoe: Free Press, 2nd Edition, 1949), esp. pp. 82 if, 345-347, 484 ff; Felix Kaufmann, op. cit., pp. 166ff. ' Peter Winch makes the similar claim that crit- ics of Weber have misunderstood him. Winch claims that Sinn is the subj ectively intended sense or meaning which an act has for the actor, and verste- hen is to understand that, and not to have some special inner sense, or intuition, of causal relations. Weber explicitly asserted the necessity of verifying hypotheses through statistical laws based on obser- vation of what happens. Peter Winch, The Idea of a Social Science (New York: Humanities Press, 1958), pp. 117-119, 112-113. 31 Alfred Schutz, op. cit., pp. 260-261. 3' Ibid, p. 261. overt action in particular excludes a great many of the more significant dimensions of social real- ity from all possible inquiry, as Schutz makes clear by listing several examples: a) Even an ideally refined behaviorism can only explain the behavior of the observed, and not of the observing, behaviorist. (This, he says, has been shown by George H. Mead in Mind, Self and So- ciety.) b) The same overt behavior (say, a tribal pag- eant as it can be captured by the movie-camera) may have an entirely different meaning to the performers of different tribes. What interests the scientist is precisely whether it is a war dance, a barter [trade], the reception of a friendly ambassa- dor, or something else of this sort. c) 'Negative actions,' that is, intentional refrain- ing from acting, escapes sensory observation. (See Max Weber's Theory of Social and Economic Or- ganization, p. 88.) Not to sell certain merchandise at a given price is doubtless as economic an action as to sell it. d) As W. I. Thomas has shown in Social Behav- ior and Personality (E. H. Volkart, ed., 1951, p. 81), social reality contains elements of belief and conviction which are real because so defined by the participants and which escape sensory observa- tion. e) Finally, and this is deemed most important by Schutz, the postulate of sensory observation of overt human behavior takes as a model a particu- lar and relatively small sector of the social world, namely, situations in which the acting individual is given to the observer in what is commonly called a face-to-face relationship. But, there are many other dimensions of the social world in which situations of this kind do not prevail-e.g., mailing a letter assumes faith in a vast system of social relationships we do not observe; as does reading an editorial about the French fearing the rearmament of Germany. In all these cases we know what is meant without observing overt behavior.' In order to take into account all of the di- 3 Ibid, pp. 262-263. According to Parsons, social interaction always involves ". . . the normative and the conditional. As process, action is, in fact, the process of alteration of the conditional ele- ments in the direction of conformity with norms. Elimination of the normative aspect altogether eliminates the concept of action itself and leads to the radical positivistic position. Elimination of conditions . . . equally eliminates action and re- sults in idealistic emanationism." And, as he points out, normative elements can only be conceived as existing in the mind of the actor, and are thus "inherently subjective." Talcott Parsons, op. cit., p. 732.</page><page sequence="7">32 TiHE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 63 tensions of social reality, therefore, Schutz argues that the social scientist must make use of his "common sense knowledge of everyday life." "This is so, because the world (the natural and the social one) is from the outset an intersubjec- tive world and because . . . our knowledge of it is in various ways socialized."34 Having nothing to do with introspection as a method opposed to scientific verification, verstehen is a result of processes of learning or acculturation. Moreover, according to Schutz, it is by no means a private affair of the observer which cannot be controlled by other observers. In his interpretation, verste- hen is controllable and determinable at least to the same extent as, for example, the private per- ceptions of facts and the "intent" of the defen- dant in trials for murder.35 '3Alfred Schutz, op. cit., p. 263. This "intersub- jectivity" appears quite clearly as Schutz points out, in the self-correcting process of scientific in- quiry itself. Science is a social enterprise, "but the postulate to describe and explain behavior in terms of controllable sensory observation stops short before the description and explanation of the pro- cess by which scientist B controls and verifies the observational findings of scientist A and the con- clusions drawn by him. In order to do so, B has to know what A, has observed, what the goal of his inquiry is, why he thought the observed fact worthy of being observed, i.e., relevant to the scientific problem at hand, etc. This knowledge is commonly called understanding. The explanation of how such a mutual understanding of human beings might occur is apparently left to the social scientist. But whatever his explanation might be, one thing is sure, namely, that such an intersub- jective understanding between scientist B and scientist A occurs neither by scientist B's observa- tion of scientist A's overt behavior, nor by intro- spection performed by B, nor by identification of B with A." Ibid, p. 262. 35Ibid., p. 264. The "intersubjective (objective) nature of this learning process is analyzed by Schutz in "Common Sense and Scientific Inter- pretation of Human Action," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 14, No. 1 (September, 1953), p. 12. He relates the origin of common con- structs to the understanding imparted by com- munication, which in turn depends on "a commu- nity of time and space" between the persons in- volved. And the latter implies that a certain sector of the outer world is equally within the reach of each person, and that they can inter- change positions to acquire the perspective of the other. Significantly, Schutz cites Charles H. Cooley and George Mead on this matter. The similarity, if not identity, between "so- The world of nature, as explored by the natural scientist, does not 'mean' anything to the molecules, atoms, and electrons therein. The observational field of the social scientist, however, namely the social reality, has a specific meaning and relevance structure for the human beings living, acting, and thinking therein. Thus, the constructs of the social sciences are, so to speak, constructs of the second degree, namely constructs of the constructs made by the actors on the social scene, whose behavior the social scientist has to observe and to explain in accordance with the procedural rules of his science.' This analysis makes it plain that there is an essential difference between the "thought ob- jects" or mental constructs formed by the social sciences and those formed by the physical sciences.37 The adoption of the principle of con- cial relations" and concepts in general should be obvious at this point. As even Lerner and Lass- well make clear, following Clyde Kluckhohn, in order to understand cultures we must know so- cial relations and social relations are meanings. Observed action must be conceptualized in terms of their purposes in the minds of the subjects. Daniel Lerner and Harold D. Lasswell (eds.), The Policy Sciences (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1951), pp. 89-90, 101. And, the meaning of concepts cannot be explained in terms of the ac- tions of any individual person, or persons-they are presupposed, learned, and shared. See Maurice Mandelbaum, "Societal Facts," British Journal of Sociology, 6, No. 4 (December, 1955), p. 305; Felix Kaufmann, op. cit., pp. 18-19; Peter Winch, op. cit., pp. 121-123. "6Alfred Schutz, "Concept and Theory Forma- tion," op. cit., pp. 266-267. See also Peter Winch, op. cit., pp. 83-85. " This difference appears in the fact that the criteria according to which the student of politics ". . . judges that, in two situations, the same thing has happened, or the same action performed, must be understood in relation to the rules gov- erning sociological investigation. But here we run against a difficulty: for whereas in the case of the natural scientist we have to deal with only one set of rules, namely those governing the scientist's investigation itself, here what the sociologist is studying, as well as his study of it, is a human activity and is therefore carried on according to rules. And it is these rules, rather than those which govern the sociologist's investigation, which spec- ify what is to count as 'doing the same kind of thing' in relation to that kind of activity." Peter Winch, op. cit., pp. 86-87. If, then, the scholar's criteria of concept formation must come from the rules of action found in political life, his relation</page><page sequence="8">1969 CONCEPT FORMATI)N IN NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES 33 cept formation described above-namely, that classifications of social action must be in terms of concepts which are meaningful to the agent as well as to the observer-is therefore the only course of action open to the student of social be- havior and institutions. But this in no way im- plies a non-behavioral position regarding the problem of verification. It is not that a different way of knowing (namely, "scientific" as against "intuitive") is at the basis of the differences be- tween the physical and the social sciences, but that the object of knowledge is different. The social sciences must develop concepts of the in- tentional dimension of social reality. Thus, as Natanson recognizes, the "subjectivism" of We- ber's postulate of interpretation does not mean that private, unverifiable elements are involved in the verification of hypotheses. As he quite correctly puts it, "it is concerned rather with the conceptual framework within which social reality may be comprehended."38 IV. THE PRACTICE OF CONCEPT FORMATION IN THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE OF POLITICS The methodological principle that the con- cepts of the political scientist must be meaning- ful to the actor as well as to the observer is a principle that is exemplified in contemporary be- havioral research without upsetting the verifia- bility principle. It would be impossible within the scope of this article to cite as evidence in support of this statement all relevant instances of empirical research accomplished since the turn of the century. Nevertheless, the conclusion that behavioral research conforms to this princi- ple would seem to be justifiable if the two gen- eral types of inquiry, as illustrated by work which is accepted as representative by leaders of the behavioral movement,39 were indeed found to the practitioners of politics ". . . cannot be just that of observer to observed. It must rather be analogous to the participation of the natural scientist with his fellow-workers in the activities of scientific investigation. Putting the point gen- erally, even if it is legitimate to speak of one's understanding of a mode of social activity as con- sisting in a knowledge of regularities, the nature of this knowledge must be very different from the nature of knowledge of physical regularities."

See also Talcott Parsons, op. cit., pp. 82-83 and 5, where it is made clear that the conceptual framework, though not necessarily the technique of verifica- tion, of the theory of action is couched in terms of subjective categories. to conform to this principle of concept forma- tion. Attitude Studies. One broad area of inquiry which has become prominent among behavioral students of politics has been the study of orien- tations toward the political process. In this area socio-psychological phenomena such as motives, attitudes, and opinions are analyzed and used to explain such types of behavior as party prefer- ences, voting participation, and the psychologi- cal bases of political extremism. The individual is the source of these types of primary data al- though often the analysis is developed in terms of the significant groups in a given society. The study of attitudes and motives (relative to political ideology) is conveniently illustrated in the research done in this area by Herbert McClosky.40 The report which describes these investigations into the relationships between personality attributes and conservative ideology succinctly and lucidly indicates that the proce- dures used in the formation of his basic concepts are completely in accord with the methodologi- cal principle which we have argued is a neces- sary assumption in social and political inquiry. Recognizing that the term "conservatism" is an important and common one in political life, and one that is used in different contexts to refer to the ideas of Burke, laissez-faire liberals, critics of the New Deal, or Republicans of any persua- sion, McClosky admits that the definition that he has chosen to employ in his research, and the measure that was constructed from this defini- tion, will not be satisfactory to everyone. How- ever, the major point of interest to us is not the content of his definition but the manner in which he went about constructing it and the subsequent scales based on it. He began this construction by attempting "to extract from the tradition of self-styled conservative thought, and especially from the writings of Edmund Burke, a set of principles representing that tra- dition as fairly as possible. We have concen- trated," he explains, "upon those attitudes and values that continually recur among acknowl- edged conservative thinkers and that appear to comprise the invariant elements of the conserva- tive outlook."'4' 'See Heinz Eulau, Political Behavior (Glencoe: Free Press, 1956); and his article, "Political Sci- ence" in Bert F. Hoselitz, A Reader's Guide to the Social Sciences (Glencoe: Free Press, 1959), pp. 89-127. ' Herbert McClosky, "Conservatism and Per- sonality," this REVIEW, 52 (March, 1958), 27-45. 41 Ibid., p. 30.</page><page sequence="9">34 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 63 From these rather vague generalizations culled from conservative literature McClosky went on to isolate an "initial pool of 43 items" -that is to say, a tentative set of fairly brief and straightforward statements embodying what he thought were elements of conservative doc- trine. This entire set of items was then submit- ted, "through survey methods, to a large general sample of persons in the vicinity of the Twin Cities who were asked to state, in relation to each item, whether they agreed or disagreed." This was done in order to select items which clustered sufficiently "to convince us that they belonged to the same universe, . . ." to reduce the number of items, and to insure consistency among them.42 With the twelve-item conserva- tism measure that emerged from the analysis of the results of this survey, McClosky found that he could rank people from extreme conservatism at one end to liberalism on the other in a man- ner very close to the ranking obtained using the original 43-item pool. In addition, the procedures used to validate the scale, like those used to construct it, exem- plify the methodological principle previously stated. In order to determine the degree to which the scale measured what it purported to measure, McCloskv submitted subsets of items from the twelve-item conservatism scale . . .to an advanced class in political theory, whose members had no prior knowledge of the study or its purposes. Each student was asked to supply a name or label for the group of statements and to write a paragraph explaining or justifying the label he had chosen. Of 48 students partici- pating, 39 volunteered the word Conservatism as best describing the sentiments expressed in the statements, five offered names that were virtually synonymous with conservatism (e.g., traditional- ism), while two supplied other names and two did not answer.43 Thus, just as MeClosky developed his origi- nal propositions ("items" in the questionnaire which defined the operational concept of conser- vatism) out of statements drawn from the tra- ditional doctrines of conservatism, so he also validated the concept of conservatism by deter- mining whether living persons who were pre- sumably aware of the contemporary definitions of conservatism in the tradition of political thought and in American society shared the same concept of conservatism. Undoubtedly it 4 Ibid., pp. 30-31. Altogether, over 80 pools of items were submitted, the conservatism pool be- ing only one of them. 43 Ibid., pp. 32-33. would be possible for a "crude behaviorist" to claim that all that this study is based on is the assumption that a conservative is someone who is defined by a series of marks on a certain sheet of paper. "Conservatism is what conserva- tism tests test," one might say, echoing the well-known tautology about IQ tests. This, how- ever, was not MeClosky's assumption. His intro- ductory remarks clearly indicate his assumption that conservatism, like liberalism, is a set of ideas that are actually efficacious in orienting human behavior and have been, and are, histori- cally existent. Conservatism is not, that is, merely a scientific construct, a classification de- veloped in the minds of scholars in the hope that it might serve as an index of future behav- ior, much as a high score on an IQ examination seems to serve as a sign of future high perfor- mance in college. On the contrary, conservatism is primarily a complex of notions that is actually operative in political life and MeClosky's "Conservatism scale" is an attempt to measure, in the sense of ranking, a number of individuals along what is assumed to be a real attitude dimension. By forming his basic concepts on the basis of the expressions of conservative ideas given him by both past and present social actors or agents who are active, at least intellectually, in political life, he has insured that his eventual explana- tions of political preference, belief, and affiliation are based on concepts which are meaningful to those agents as well as to the scientific observer. Attitude studies such as McClosky's thus in- dicate how it is possible to form, through the development of scales, objective concepts of so- called subjective meaning-structures. In the sci- ence of politics, as in all empirical sciences, the concepts we are dealing with have intersubjec- tive validity and are not merely introspective, and the propositions we are dealing with- though there is an element of verstehen in their constituent concepts-are verifiable through methods that are similar in all the sciences.44 44In addition to examining the contributions in the science of politics toward understanding the "orientations toward politics" which we have been discussing, Heinz Eulau's Political Behavior ex- amines research done on the "agents and tech- niques of political power" and on activities going on in the "arena of political decision-making." The first is concerned with leadership studies, studies of the "mechanisms" by means of which influences are mobilized and transmitted. Often these studies are simply historical-descriptive analyses of social origins, religious affiliations, etc. See pp. 184-193. Where they are not, they are similar to the studies</page><page sequence="10">1969 CONCEPT FORMATION IN NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES 35 Participation Studies. Another major type of in- quiry is that which studies modes of political participation. For example, in a research study done a few years ago to determine how the Standard Oil Company (N.J.) stands with the American public, it became important to also find out who are most articulate in their feelings about big corporations and most concerned to attack or defend them. Since it was necessary to segregate the people who are relatively active in relation to national political issues from those who are relatively inactive, it was first necessary to define what "political activity" would mean for the purposes of this study. While we are not interested in the content of the definition, the procedures followed in devel- oping it are relevant. In defining "political activ- ity" the authors first wrote out a large number of questions which they thought would throw light on an individual's political behavior, and then they tried these questions out "in personal interviews with a test national sample of Ameri- can adults. Some of the questions were found not to work well in doorstep interviews, and were discarded. Others were found to yield re- sults so closely intercorrelated that one question could in effect stand for several others."45 For our purposes, it is important to note that some questions were found to mean the same as several others, and could, in fact, be used in place of several other questions. The criteria of identity utilized in forming this concept of "po- litical activity" were developed in terms that were as meaningful to the agents as to the ob- servers on two levels. The first level is the level of language which is shared by agent and inves- tigator; and, while this point is often neglected, this is what makes it possible for the scientist to "rough-up" a set of preliminary questions with the assurance that they will have at least a min- under the rubric "orientations toward politics" as far as the problem of concept formation goes. See pp. 193-204, 260-264. The second group is likewise concerned with applying the same pro- cedures, only in the context of specific (non-com- munity wide) loci, or arenas, of influence. The subject matter, i.e., influence, or political power, remains the same, as do the procedures involved in concept formation. Some of these studies in- volve merely descriptive statistics (pp. 275 ff.); others illustrate the type of concept formation analyzed (pp. 286-307). ` For example, Julian L. Woodward and Elmo Roper, "Political Activity of American Citizens," reprinted from this REVIEW, 44 (December, 1950), 872-885, in Heinz Eulau, and others (eds.), op. cit., p. 133. imum of mutual significance and utility. But, secondly, we can also see in these studies that a conscious attempt was made to reduce the ques- tions to the fewest which are most meaningful to the respondents, which most correspond to what they conceive of as "political activity." Aside from "face validity" (meaningfulness on the shared language level), the authors only claim that the resultant set of questions works well "in the sense that the questions are compre- hended and answered with apparently little ex- aggeration by people of all educational levels and political persuasions."46 What does this mean but that the investigator and the agent both understood the meaning of the questions, and that the investigator in some way felt that he knew that the agent understood? Participation studies of this sort are rela- tively simple versions of the more complex stud- ies which have come to be called studies of 'community power structure." While some of these studies make use of a certain amount of participant observation, they all depend almost wholly on interviewing. Included in the inter- view schedules are always questions designed to measure what Herbert Simon calls "beliefs as to where legitimate power lies." In a recent study of participation in a small community, for ex- ample, "the sample was asked to nominate oth- ers as 'generally more influential,' and influential in regard to school matters, local government affairs and community welfare policies. . . ." In addition, in regard to these same issues, the re- spondents were asked to designate potential pol- icy advisors by asking them: "Whom could you go to among your personal acquaintances, or persons you feel you could go to, for advice as to what should be done in regard . . ." to these issues?47 The use of questions of this type indi- cates, again, that the political scientist wants and needs to develop concepts which are as meaningful to the agents as to the investigator. Answers to questions such as "Whom could you go to among your acquaintances for advice? ... " obviously assume notions in the mind of the agent asked about the rule or norm of behavior that he is following in this context. "Though I am not now in the process of actually seeking such advice," the answer might be, "I make it a rule to consult X." Even in those cases in which the answer must be descriptive of past behavior -as in answer to the question, "whom have you consulted during the past year on issue Y?"-it 46 Loc. cit. 4 Robert E. Agger and Vincent Ostrom, "Politi- cal Participation in a Small Community," in Heinz Eulau, and others, op. cit., p. 139.</page><page sequence="11">36 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 63 should be clear that the question implicitly as- sumes that the principle according to which X has been consulted about Y continues to hold. For if, at the time the question was asked, the agent or respondent no longer intended to con- sult X, the proper answer would be, "I did see X, but now I distrust his judgment and will no longer consult him." At that time, X is no lon- ger an influential in this respect. Clearly, in no case do we actually see the agent consulting X, nor do we know that his visit is to be identified as "a consultation about policy Y" unless he tells us that that is the meaning it has for him and for X. This "meaning," since it involves concepts (normative), can only be "discovered" by having them expressed in the form of state- ments or propositions-which is why interviews and questionnaires are so widely used in the so- cial sciences, and why anthropologists entering upon the study of some exotic society must learn the language and saturate themselves in the traditions and history of the society. The latter is the only way that they can understand the patterns of action which are the institutions of the society. "Patterns of activity," therefore, actually are normative concepts communicated to the investigators by the agents.48 Survey re- 48In a recent methodological study of anthro- pology S. F. Nadel wrote that it is invariably necessary for the anthropologist to go into the field and make himself "familiar" with the culture (usually primitive) that he wishes to study and overcome its strangeness by "something like an intellectual assimilation." Significantly, he stresses the fact that the study of the native language will probably have to precede the study of culture and social life. Since the meaning of terms and sen- tences of this new language cannot be gotten by counting the letters or words "scientifically" but must be learned, Nadel is obviously implying that before any of the "objective" controls used by anthropologists can be applied the investigator must learn the meaning of the concepts, and therefore of the institutions, of the new culture. S. F. Nadel, The Foundations of Social Anthro- pology (Glencoe: Free Press, 1951), p. 6. Under- lining added. It is also relevant to note the criteria Nadel suggests for isolating different types of so-called action patterns. "We have long held," he states, "that the order of things to which social institu- tions belong is built up through collecting together standardized action patterns on the grounds of their aim contents. . . . It might also seem that the people we observe themselves have names for these 'summaries' of related action patterns-'mar- riage,' 'family,' 'chieftanship,' 'property,' and the like. All such names . . . stand for normative con- search, field studies or participant observation are techniques of applying the methodological principle that behavioral concepts, or constructs of "what is to count as doing the same thing," are derived from the normative concepts held by the subjects studied.49 V. THE RECENT REVISION OF BEHAVIOR THEORY The thesis we have been supporting can be placed in a larger context by considering some of the recent changes that have occurred in be- havior theory proper-that is, in the psychologi- cal theory of human behavior. These changes apparently have been neglected by both the op- ponents and the theoretical proponents of be- havioralism in the study of politics. Charles E. Osgood, in a recent analysis of some of the major trends in psychological theory, revealed the agreement among psycholo- gists that the basic principles of simple stimulus-response (S-R) psychology are insuffi- cient (but not necessarily wholly invalid) for an adequate analysis of human behavior.50 In his lucid summary of the development of behavior theory in psychology, Osgood declares that the psychologist has always thought of himself as limited to observing what goes into the human organism, or "stimuli," and what comes out of it, or "responses." Between these two points at which observation is possible, there lies what he calls a "no-man's land of speculation." This "area") is, at least for the physiologist, the ner- vous system; sometimes psychologists have re- ferred to it as "the little black box" in which stimuli are focused and in which, it is assumed, responses are created. Now, according to early behavior theory cepts; the institution represents, for the actor, a rule or norm, and has that kind of reality, that is, the non-spatial and in a sense timeless validity of concepts." Ibid., p. 107. Underlining added. " In addition to Peter Winch, loc. cit., see Michael Argyle, The Scientific Study of Social Behavior (London: Methuen, 1957), pp. 14-26, where it is pointed out that the social scientist has two general types of measuring instruments all his own, namely, the different kinds of interview and questionnaire, and the techniques of controlled observation (the types we have discussed), and where it is also stated that investigators must be ... well steeped in the culture of the group mem- bers, . . ." to insure the correctness of their in- terpretations of the results of their tests and observations. ' Charles E. Osgood, "Behavior Theory and the Social Sciences," Behavioral Science, 1 (July, 1956), 167-185. Reprinted in Roland Young (ed.), op. cit., pp. 217-244.</page><page sequence="12">1969 CONCEPT FORMATION IN NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES 37 .. . the psychologist's task is to explain and pre- dict relations between and among his two sets of observables, stimuli and responses, and to do this he must make certain assumptions about what goes on in the little black box. In other words, psycho- logical theory, as contrasted with psychological ob- servation, is made up of hunches about how the nervous system operates.51 Over the last century, however, psycholo- gists found that a variety of phenomena ap- peared again and again in the midst of their tra- ditional inquiries which proved embarrassing to the old single-stage (S-R) conception of behav- ior. These were symbolic phenomena, or "repre- sentational mediation processes." In their at- tempts to come to terms with these phenomena, Osgood points out that psychologists have pro- duced a slow refinement in the rules of proce- dure by which they made and tested their "hunches" about what went on in the "little black box." His description of these develop- ments is interesting, amusing, and succinct: In nineteenth-century psychology the character- istic procedure in theorizing was to simply postulate a new entity or mechanism whenever some new regularity was discovered. Whenever something needed explaining, a new explanatory device was stuck inside the little black box, and it rapidly became chock-full of ill-assorted and ill-digested demons. For every nameable phenomenon of hu- man behavior a different 'faculty' would be posited to explain it; for every nameable motive, a differ- ent 'instinct' would be listed as its explanation. And . . . Freud had big, flat-footed Super egos stomping around on red slippery Ids, while cleverly anxious little Egos tried to arbitrate. Thus . . . the little black box was filled with a wonderously di- verse collection of explanatory devices, just about as many as there were things to be explained. This could fairly be called 'junk-shop psychology.' In direct revulsion against this brand of theo- rizing, a group of American Behaviorists around the turn of the century went to the other extreme, claiming that the psychologist was better off if he made no assumptions whatsoever about what went on in the little black box .... This viewpoint toward theory has come to be known as 'empty organism psychology.' According to this view ... there is absolutely nothing in the region between S and R, and what is there is none of the psycholo- gist's business !52 Gradually it became necessary for psycholo- gists to postulate some sort of intervening vari- able between S and R. They had to put some- 51 Ibid., pp. 217-218. 62 Ibid., pp. 219-220. thing back into the "little black box," as it were, in order to explain their observations. The con- temporary behaviorist therefore has postulated an intervening or internal response-like process which produces self-stimulation. In other words, ". . . modern 'mediation psychology' sets up within the organism a replica of the S-R model, and it assumes that the same laws governing single-stage S-R process apply to both stages of the mediation model."53 Osgood goes on to develop much more com- plicated models of this mediation process, but the point remains the same. The observed be- havior not only of humans, but also of animals, suggests that it is necessary to assume that often external stimuli arouse some intervening process which in turn produces a certain behav- ior-"problem solving," "learning," etc.,-which is partially independent of the stimulus. Os- good mentions several facts in both animal and human behavior which cannot be handled with a single-stage S-R model.54 The term generally used to refer to this intervening process is "sym- bolic mechanism"-but, though the phrase seems Hobbesian, the methodology appropriate to a study of symbolic behavior indicates that a mechanistic analogy is inappropriate. As Os- good states, this type of theory . . .places a premium on developing methods of indexing representational states, e.g., measuring meaning, particularly in human organisms. My own research . . . has been directed chiefly along these lines. Dealing with language responses themselves- which, after all, are supposed to be 'expressions of meaning'-we have been trying to discover a lim- ited number of basic factors or dimensions along which meaningful reactions vary and hence can be measured.' It seems to me that in "dealing with language responses" Osgood-and other modern behav- iorists dealing with somewhat different prob- lems-must operate in a context of shared meaning with their "respondents" or "subjects." That this is the case is indicated by an example given in Osgood's article of a study of abstract "assigns," that is to say, symbols or terms whose meanings are literally assigned through repeated association with simpler signs having direct behavioral reference.56 This implies that 53 Ibid., p. 220.

"6Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="13">38 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW VOL. 63 meanings can have an existence independent of immediate physical stimuli. As Osgood points out, it is precisely this which makes possible im- itation, identification, and the sharing of person- ality and culture traits. Furthermore, it is pre- cisely this learning process that lies at the bot- tom of all types of social behavior. And it is this capacity of personality to construct "equiva- lences" (which refer to the same fact that Peter Winch called the need and the ability to formu- late rules) which lies at the bottom of concept formation in everyday life as well as in the professional life of the behavioral scientist. Thus, the philosophical objection of Peter Winch to behaviorism-that the social scientist must base his judgments of identity, his classifi- cations, and therefore his entire conceptual scheme on the judgments of identity (or the meaning) attributed to their own and others' behavior by the subjects studied themselves-is a valid criticism of what Osgood has called the "single-stage S-R process" or early behaviorism, but it provides only a philosophical clarification of modern behavior theory. Thus, both the present practices of behav- ioral students of politics and contemporary be- havioral theory have converged toward a redis- covery of mind in the sense of assuming repre- sentational states whose meaning is expressed by language responses. No longer is mind nothing but a "subjective entity" to be discarded from scientific inquiry according to the program of Bentley and the "radical behaviorists." And the techniques which have been developed to rank individuals along attitude dimensions according to their meaningful statements (not, it should be noted, to "measure" the concepts in their heads) do not merely apply the methods of the physical sciences to the "moral sciences" as Mill and his intellectual descendents hoped would be possible. No physical scientist is ever required in his studies to ask questions of his objects of in- quiry as part of the process of concept forma- tion; yet, this has become in practice and in theory a fundamental principle of behavioral re- search. VI. CONCLUSION The notion that it is possible and sufficient to observe overt patterns of social interaction in the same way it is possible to observe the pat- tern of tracks left in the snow by some winter stroller belongs to the doctrines of early behav- iorism as exemplified in political theory in the writings of Bentley. Although it is no longer present in either the theory or practice of be- havioral science, it remains a vestigial feature of the idea of a science of politics in the minds of some of its critics. These critics have advocated the thesis that the study of politics cannot elim- inate common sense notions of events and be- havior and the distinctions made in ordinary language. However, a critical understanding of the no- tion of verstehen, which has been put forth as the method of discovering common-sense mean- ings, led to the conclusion that indeed the politi- cal scientist must base his judgments of identity, and therefore his classifications, on the judg- ments of identity (or the meaning) attributed to their own and others' behavior by the sub- jects or agents who are being studied. Partici- pants in the social situation itself "define the sit- uation," that is, define the underlying norms guiding action, and therefore also the institu- tions and "patterns of behavior" that the politi- cal scientist investigates. But we also concluded that developing criteria of identity and forming concepts is a problem of semantics, and thus a philosophical problem. Therefore, our procedures at this level of rational activity do not change the fact that, once those concepts have been formed and made use of in the construction of scientific hypotheses, the procedures or methods for verifying hypotheses are logically the same in the social as in the physical sciences.57 The most urgent question of this part of the "We may agree with Nagel and with Schutz that all of the empirical sciences must be ob- jective "in the sense that their propositions are subjected to controlled verifications and must not refer to private uncontrollable experience." Alfred Schutz, op. cit., p. 270. We may also agree that in the empirical sciences, theory means "the ex- plicit formulation of determinate relations between a set of variables in terms of which a fairly ex- tensive class of empirically ascertainable regu- larities can be explained . . ." (and that) "neither the fact that these regularities have in the social sciences a rather narrowly restricted universality, nor the fact that they permit prediction only to a rather limited extent, constitutes a basic differ- ence between the social and the natural sciences, since many branches of the latter show the same features."

Neurosis, obtuseness, malice, lack of knowledge regarding possible unintended consequences all make it difficult for the social scientist to equate an individual's expressed in- tention with the "real meaning" of his act. On the surface it would seem that modern research technology does cope with this problem through proper questions and analysis of answers. On the other hand, the problem of unintended conse- quences especially would seem to push one on from the level of concept formation to the level of explanation. In either case, the problem seems In this sense, the foregoing criticism of the notion of verstehen together with the analysis of the procedures actually involved in developing criteria of identity provide a theoretical clarifi- cation of some of the methodological assumptions underlying what modern behaviorists are ac- tually doing in their empirical research. Like- wise, political theorists, traditionalists, or "anti- behavioralists" should realize that "under the pressure of trying to handle language phe- nomena," scholars working in behavioral science have modified their postulates and "have found it necessary to put something else back into the little black box." The "little black box," the human organism, is no longer postulated as an empty cipher. "Central integration," as well as "symbolic, representational processes," are nec- essary assumptions to explain language and other behavior. And it should be obvious to the '"anti-behavioralists" that a discipline which as- sumes, again in Osgood's words, that "lan- guage responses are indicative of meaning," and that methodologically the psycho-social re- searcher must deal with those language re- sponses themselves to determine "the limited number of dimensions along which meaningful reactions vary,"60 is making an assumption about "human nature," and about language and reason, that is no different from the assumption which traditional political theorists make about the meaningfulness or intentionality of political life. sufficiently complex and related to other aspects of theory construction to warrant separate investi- gation.
