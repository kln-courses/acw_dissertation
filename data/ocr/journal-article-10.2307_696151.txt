THE object of this set of Gifford Lectures, delivered at the University of Aberdeen, is not 'to criticise any existing system of philo- sophy, or to construct a new one in its place,' but 'to reproduce, as far as may be without prejudice or passion, the kind of answers which the religious teachers of ancient Greece -that is to say the poets and philosophers -were able to supply to those spiritual problems which are not of to-day, or yester- day, but for all time.' The three main problems or questions are as to the divine nature, man's duty to the gods, and the future life. In Homer, the two conspicuous features of the divine nature are polytheism and anthropomorphism; the duty of man to God is to ' acknowledge his dependence on the divine authority in every circumstance of his life,' and to express it by sacrifice and prayer; while, as to the future life, we may almost say,' that we do wrong to speak of a future hzfe in Homer: it is only a little more life than that of our image in a glass.' The answers which we extract from Homer to these three questions were practically not developed by poetry in the period from Hesiod to Bacchylides: indeed down to the fourth century B.C. ' the orthodox Greek con- ception of the under world was still in the main derived from Homer'; and the Platonic Euthyphro ' is represented by Plato as the incarnation of Homeric orthodoxy' in the matter of man's duty to the gods. Then in the sixth century B.C. the Orphic doctrine of the celestial origin and nature of the soul introduced 'a new and more spiritual concep- tion both of God and man,' opposed in all fundamental respects to the Homeric view, and providing a basis for the belief in immor- tality. It is on the Orphic conception of man's relationship with God that 'by far the most remarkable and distinctive portion of Pindar's religious doctrine' rests-his con- ception of immortality, a conception altogether different from that of earlier Greek poets. Aeschylus, too, like Pindar and the Orphics, recognises a judgment and penalties here- after. Sophocles, on the other hand, 'keeps his drama pure from Orphic and Pythagorean elements': the religious teaching of the Sophoclean drama is summed up in the words of the Philoctetes: ' Remember that ye show piety to the gods; piety dies not with men: whether they live or die, it endures for ever.' The dissemination of Orphic religious ideas, nearly all of which were irreconcilable with the religion of Homer, prepared the way for the philosophers' revolt against the authority of Homer. The beginning of this revolt is sketched in Lecture IX. from Thales to Xenophanes: the unity of God was affirmed, in opposition to the Homeric poly- theism; and it was taught that God is uncreated, and that He is a God of truthful- ness and morality. A most interesting lecture on Heraclitus sets forth, with the lucidity and sobriety which characterises the book from beginning to end, the position that in Heraclitus the Logos, ' The Word,' is God. The Heraclitean concept of Logos was elaborated by the Stoics; from them it passed to Philo; and 'the link between Greek philosophy and Christian thought was once for all established by the author of the Fourth Gospel when he proclaimed that the Logos had become incarnate in Jesus Christ.' For the student of theological ideas Par- menides and the Eleatics are of little or no importance: 'the concept of God disappears for them in that of Being.' As for Empe- docles, nowhere does he maintain that God is one: ' and a belief in divine unity cannot well be reconciled with the pluralism of his physics.' By Anaxagoras the Heraclitean unity was resolved 'into a duality in which Mind and Matter stand over against one another as two distinct and mutually exclusive principles.' Whether he expressly identified his Nous with God or not, 'we are fully justi- fied in maintaining that Anaxagoras is the founder of theism in the western world.'</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 253 Amongst the Sophists we meet with an ag- nosticism which is sometimes virtual atheism; and 'an individualism so extreme as to strike at the foundations of society.' The Sophists destroyed, 'but did not, to any great extent rebuild.' And it is 'chiefly as the poetical interpreter of the age of the Sophists' that Euripides is treated. His theological opinions r~eveal 'the same spirit of open-mindedness and vacillation' as do his reflections on immortality. Indeed, he was essentially iconoclastic and destructive: 'on the posi- tive or reconstructive side, we find a multitude of suggestions, without, so far as I can see, any single dominating principle.' With Socrates a new intellectual and spiritual era begins: the Christian fathers are to a certain extent right in speaking of the philosophy of Socrates and Plato as a pre- paration for the gospel: ' the fundamental religious ideas of Platonism have much in common with those of Christianity.' Ignor- ance was the Socratic equivalent of sin; and ' Socrates' conception of knowledge is the intellectual counterpart of the Christian con- ception of faith.' What Socrates believed about the immortality of the soul is not easy to determine; but he first deliberately em- ployed the argument from design; and the Socratic formula of prayer, 'in its perfect faith and self-suppression is more Christian than Greek.' The lectures on Plato, which occupy one- third of the whole book, are devoted to explaining the general religious significance of Plato's thought. Attention is called 'to the real kinship of thought-illuminating, I think, as far as it goes-between Plato and St. Paul.' The distinction which in the Timaeus Plato drew between the Creator and the World-soul prepared the way for the theology of Philo; and in ' the conception of the divine nature as a differentiated unity we may perceive, with Baur, a certain re- semblance to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.' Indeed, 'the Timaeus did more than any other literary masterpiece to facili- tate and promote that fusion of Hellenism and Hebraism out of which so much Christian theology has sprung.' Again, 'the Platonic E\E1 Oavdrov is also strikingly parallel to many exhortations in St. Paul.' The ulti- mate object of the meditatio mortis of the Phaedo and the intellectualis amor of the Symposium is 'to reach those eternal and unseen realities to which the soul is itself akin'; and the scheme of education in the Republic is directed towards the same end. Plato's conception of the ethical end is 'assimilation to God'-5'olwo-ss 7T Y"0. And the five preliminary studies, in his system of education form the -drvo8os r70o ovTs, or ascent into the realm of Being. Agreeing with Aristotle that Plato regarded his Ideas as transcendent, Adam could not believe that the Ideal Theory originated in 'an attempt to find a sure foundation for knowledge and knowledge only-we cannot but feel that there were other and hardly less powerful impulses at work.' The Ideas con- stitute a world of transcendental models or archetypes of perfection, and 'Plato's religion consists in the passionate uplifting of the mind towards this realm of perfection.' But the Ideas are not only transcendent: they are also immanent; and 'for the student of religious, not of philosophical thought,' the mode of their immanence is of no little interest. The philosophical difficulty of this transcendent immanence Plato himself stated in the Parmenides, 'and never succeeded in refuting'; but he adhered, nevertheless, to the belief, and Christianity took it up: ' the doctrine of Parousia as the presence of the Infinite in the finite underlies the deepest religious teaching of St. Paul's Epistles, as well as the Gospel and Epistles of St. John.' The Idea of Good, in Adam's view, ' stands for Plato's philosophical conception of God.' Hence, the whole of Nature, so far as it really exists, is a revelation of God ; but evil really exists, and can never be eliminated altogether from this world. As for the next world, according to Adam, Plato would hold 'that we do not lose, but rather regain, our perfect individuality by union with the all-embracing, all-sustaining mind or spirit in which even now we live and move and have our being.' At this point the lectures stop. There is no concluding lecture to summarise the results of this survey of Greek poetry and philo- sophy, or to indicate what, if any, conclusions may be drawn from the survey. The infer- ence is that the survey was not made for the</page><page sequence="3">254 THE  CLASSICAL REVIEW purpose of drawing, or even of suggesting, any such general conclusions. The purpose of the lectures is purely objective; it is, as stated on the first page of the book, 'to re- produce, as far as may be without prejudice or passion,' the teaching of the various religious teachers of Greece. The very title of the work-' The Religious Teachers of Greece' -abstains from promising or suggesting that the doctrines they taught will be found to have any underlying unity, or to be the stages in a process of evolution. And yet on the second page of the book we are invited 'to consider the development of religious ideas in Greek philosophy and poetry from Homer down to Plato,' and to consider them from the point of view ' of the spiritual connexion between Greek philosophy and Christianity,' of which the early Fathers of the Church were conscious. That spiritual connexion is indeed indicated in the lectures; and we are grateful for it, and for the con- sideration given to the development of Greek religious ideas. We would gladly have had more. Had it been given, it would have been of the best, as is all that James Adam has given to the world. F. B. JEVONS.</page></plain_text>
