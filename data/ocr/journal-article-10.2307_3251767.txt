The Johns Hopkins University FLORIAN PREISIG Janell Watson. Literature and material culture from Balzac to Proust: the collection and consumption of curiosities. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999. 227 pp. ISBN: 0 521 49914 3. Scholarship in the field of material culture has been growing in the past few years, particularly in history and the social sciences. With this study of nineteenth-century French literature,Janell Watson has transported this field of inquiry into the realm of the literary text. At times insightful and illuminating, her work also reflects the claustrophobia of the nineteenth- century interiors she so aptly evokes. Staking out her territory as the "interconnectedness of the material, the social, and the textual" (170), Watson examines literary texts from Balzac, Flaubert, Maupassant, Gautier, Huysmans, the Goncourts, Jean Lorrain, Rachilde, and Proust (along with a few others in lesser detail). Her fil conducteur is the category of the bibelot, an object that is both prevalent and protean in nineteenth-century literature and culture. The conspicuous role of bibelots in nineteenth-century literature is a function of their increased presence in nineteenth-century interiors. How- ever, the bibelot as a category of objects maintains a fundamental ambiguity, as it can include rare curiosities, expensive objets d'art, and mass-produced kitsch. Likewise, the bibelot demonstrates an intrinsic mobility throughout the nineteenth century, as it moves among the social classes, finding a place in the aristocratic, the artistic, and the bourgeois interior, and as it is articulated in the household, the collection, the marketplace, and the museum. This ambiguity and mobility form the semantic field of Watson's inquiry, as she moves from the early nineteenth-century anthropomorphic interiors of Balzac, where objects in some manner reflect their owners' depths, to the superficial interiors of late century decadence, where the realms of the animate (owners) and inanimate (bibelots) are deliberately confused, and where there is only surface. Watson employs Bourdieu's theory of "the logic of practice" in her study, 934</page><page sequence="2">M L N beginning in the second chapter and at various points throughout her work, as a means of reconciling some of the ambiguities and contradictions inherent in the term bibelot. Practical logic affords Watson the malleable tool she needs to discuss material culture, a category of daily life that resists formal, logical analysis. "The bibelot belongs to a world of material objects structured by the practical logic of daily life, which is to say 'just enough logic' to get by." (28) The bibelot brings into play a series of oppositions-useful/ useless, valuable/worthless, artistic/kitsch, old/new, and pretty/beautiful- basic oppositions that form "practical taxonomies." These taxonomies sup- port analytical classifications, and through them, the logic of practice actually permeates formal logic. While Watson admits that the bibelot "pushes practical logic to its limits" (29), it remains useful to her as she also draws on elements of aesthetics in her discussions of the bibelot, a field like that of daily life that also defies the rigor of formal logic. The locus of the bibelot, and of the textual analyses in this work, is the interior, more specifically, what Watson calls the eclectic or artistic interior, a room that has incorporated collecting into its scheme. These rooms can exist in aristocratic homes as well as bourgeois apartments, but what remains salient is "the aesthetization of the interior" (67), an attempt to connect the objects in a room with the artistic production outside the home, by way of imitating the artists of a period. While imitations of artistic interiors by the bourgeoisie could often be vulgar and derivative, during the 1880s in particular, many manuals of interior decorating and style appeared to guide middle class tastes, and it is to Watson's credit that she draws on these contemporary sources in her evocation of the nineteenth-century interior, creating an historical context that adds texture to her study. The heart of this work is the textual analysis, careful readings of passages and plots from nineteenth-century novels, short stories, and journals, where Watson applies her characterizations of the bibelot to literary texts. Her chapter on Bouvard et Pecuchet ("musees recus") is a solid piece of scholarship. Traditional readings of the main characters' collections are supplanted as Watson introduces actual catalogues of contemporary and local museums to show that nearly every object Flaubert has described, a seeming hodge-podge of unrelated things, appears in one or the other of these catalogues, and in the same jumbled categories. There is then a system to this collection, one that reflects contemporary museum practices, and the incoherence, the disorder that is usually read into this work is shown to be false. "The contamination of spheres of objects, whose perception as separate was only ever illusory, underpins the fictitious world of material culture in Bouvard et Pecuchet." (89). The three chapters that follow this study of Flaubert each offer interesting perspectives on the nineteenth-century interior, on its portrayal in nine- teenth-century literature, and on its critical reception and reading in the twentieth century (especially by Baudrillard). Looking at novels that employ descriptive inventories of objects (Balzac's La peau de chagrin and the 935</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS Goncourts' Manette Salomon) and at texts that are themselves inventories (Huysmans' A Rebours and Edmond de Goncourt's Maison d'un artiste), Watson delineates the divide between modernist and postmodernist criti- cism. While the moderns (she uses Lukacs as an example) value tightly constructed narratives and prefer description to be utterly subordinate to character and plot, the postmodernist view celebrates fragmentation, lists, and the ornamental. It is the late nineteenth century's turn to consumer capitalism that is mirrored in these decadent texts wherein accumulation and stockpiling take on verbal form. And it is postmodernism as "the cultural logic of consumer capitalism" (142) that makes it so sympathetic to the novel- as-catalogue, to ornamental texts. The "readability" of an interior forms another chapter/study, and here again Watson sets up a dichotomy. On one hand, early nineteenth-century texts employed descriptions of interiors as reflections of their inhabitants (Balzac's opening tableau of a pension in Le pere Goriot), and on the other, later texts such as Proust's Jean Santeuil present interiors where the reader can no longer "read" anything from the objects. The relationship between dweller and dwelling shifts during the century, moving from the fetishism of collectors who remain passionately attached to objects (thus interiors that reflect the owner), to the alienation of consumers who compulsively pur- chase too many objects of no personal value to them (resulting in interiors cluttered with impersonal objects). Or as Watson expresses it: "too much distance between persons and things results in alienation, whereas too much closeness results in fetishism." (166) Fetishism figures again in the final chapter, as the fantastic intrudes into several nineteenth-century interiors, rooms inhabited by bachelors who thwart the traditional oedipal structures of desire, rivalry, seduction, and marriage. Because these characters refuse to abide by bourgeois values, their object-filled rooms take on fantastic and frightening dimensions; a lock of hair come to life as a beautiful woman (Maupassant's La chevelure), a mummified foot is transformed into an Egyptian princess (Gautier's Lepied de momie), furniture walks out of the door and reappears in the antique shop (Maupassant's Qui sait?), and a woman spurns a flesh-and-blood lover, preferring a life-sized vase (Rachilde's La jongleuse). By their over-attachment to things, the characters of these short stories and novels detach themselves from other people. The animate and the inanimate are once again confused in the realm of the fantastic and the decadent, as objects proliferate, suffocate, and dominate. It is to be regretted that no illustrations are included in a work that is so highly visual in nature. To evoke again and again decorated rooms and fantastic objects and to not provide a visual representation is a major lapse. The photographic and lithographic troves from this period could have been easily called into play. On the other hand, Watson's frequent use of textual passages from nineteenth-century literary and "paraliterary" texts is an integral part of the study, and they are afforded complete translations into 936</page><page sequence="4">M L N English. This inclusion of translations is a crucial one in such an interdiscipli- nary study. The copious notes and thorough bibliography are also valuable additions. In the end though, Watson finds herself trapped in the cluttered interiors she attempts to articulate. Surrounded by an increasing quantity of useless and decorative objects, she cannot see the larger implications of both collecting and ownership. Objects are not only emblems of the developing capitalist marketplace and consumer culture of the nineteenth century, they are also intimately connected with time itself, with the past, and with a sense of loss. Emblems not only of commercialism and consumption, conveyors not only of social status and artistic taste, they are also emblems of something (a civilization, an experience, a memory) which has passed out of the present moment and which the collector or consumer attempts to recuperate by possessing its material relic. Material culture in this study is also limited in scope, in that it is equated with the bibelot, with decorative objects. However, nineteenth-century interi- ors held much more in the way of material culture. Natural history specimens and objects formed a large part of the decoration of aristocratic and bourgeois parlors. Book collections were also predominant in many house- holds. Paintings, statuary, and in the latter part of the era, photographs abounded in room after room. While some of these categories of objects might be considered by Watson to be "bibelots," many of them are left out of her study. It is important to keep in mind that the nineteenth-century interior was not only cluttered with useless knick-knacks, it was also littered with once living creatures, with portraits of the living and the dead, and with living specimens of nature. By excluding the subjective and nostalgic realm of the bibelot, and by excluding entire categories of nineteenth-century material culture, Watson has limited her study to a corner of the market, so to speak. For by the late nineteenth century, the cycle of nature, which Watson identifies as the basic ordering principle of the early nineteenth century's system of objects (165), was being replaced with the forward motion of modernity, of thermodynam- ics (Foucault's statement that "the nineteenth century found its essential mythological resources in the second principle of thermodynamics"), a forward motion that left the past behind (utterly). Nineteenth-century interiors, yes, were cluttered with objects of varying value and fulfilling various roles, but they were also imbued with a sense of time (lost). Closed to the outside world, layered with carpets, wall hangings, framed pictures and photographs; filled with nature brought indoors (ferns and aquariums, fossils and shells), and cluttered with bibelots of both high and low culture, they left no room for the present moment, perhaps the most uncertain and frighten- ing object of all. 937 SUE WATERMAN The Johns Hopkins University</page></plain_text>
