<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sexuality and Cargo Cults: The Politics of Gender and Procreation in West New Britain Andrew Lattas Department of Anthropology University of Sydney, Australia The Kaliai area came under colonial rule in the early 20th century. The Ger- mans appointed a headman or luluai who was accountable for his village to vis- iting patrol officers. This system of indirect rule continued under Australian co- lonial administration. It ended when local councils were set up in 1967 (Counts 1968:10-38). Present administrative control is hindered by a total absence of roads into the Kaliai interior. The major patrol posts (Gloucester and Talasea) can be reached only by a one-day boat journey along the coast. There is a smaller patrol post at Iboki which is on the Kaliai coast and located about one-half to two days' walk from most interior villages. Most government officials find the walk into the Kaliai interior troublesome and tend to visit the bush villagers only two or three times a year. The Catholic priest at Kaliai makes visits of similar fre- quency. Government and church officials, along with coastal villagers, generally regard bush villagers with disdain and fear. Bush people are seen as being igno- rant, superstitious, irreligious, wild, and even primitive. The absence of ready transport into the Kaliai bush means that trade stores are found mostly on the coast and major rivers, along with the growing and pro- cessing of coconuts for copra. A government ship travels along the coast every week collecting copra and delivering trade store goods. The biggest form of cargo that bush Kaliai villagers remember coming into the interior was with the Amer- icans during World War II. This perhaps explains why it is Americans rather than Australians who tend to figure in bush Kaliai cargo cult narratives.2 The recent setting up of a "school," a trade store, and an airstrip at Amkor by American New Tribes Missions has had the effect of reviving bush Kaliai cargo cults. Apart from American missionaries at Amkor (which is two days' walk from the coast), there is only one other white person permanently in the area-a plantation man- ager at Iboki. Bush villagers tend to not send their children to school or pay taxes; the major exceptions being the villagers of Bolo and Salke which are closer to the coast. Many villagers find government imposed workdays odious. Some have chosen to settle further inland so as to escape the control of councillors, teachers, and the scrutiny of government officials. Most people are familiar with the plantation 230</page><page sequence="2">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 231 economy and are critical of the small wage they earn there. People are attracted to plantations by the prospect of earning money to purchase clothing and cooking utensils and for a chance to enjoy a "European" diet of rice and tinned fish. This labor migration threatens the viability and unity of villages by reducing their size and kinship composition. Many of those who have gone to work in the wage-labor system of various plantations and towns have never returned to their villages. Those who have returned have made no significant investment back to their vil- lages. Attempts by some to establish trade stores have failed, partly because it is difficult for people to charge their kinsmen what are perceived to be the high ex- ploitative prices of whites (waitskin).3 Bush people tend to be critical of indige- nous enterprises such as trade stores and cash crops. Indeed bisnis (business) is perceived by many to be immoral, it is associated closely with the perceived sel- fishness and ungenerousness of whites. This antibusiness attitude is in direct op- position to the probusiness ideology pushed by patrol officers.4 Colonialism and the Politics of Procreation It has been noted that Melanesian cargo cults tend not to be based in urban areas (Counts 1972:381; Lawrence 1964). They emerge more out of capitalism's relationship to societies located on what Terence Turner calls its "internal mar- gins" (Turner 1986:91). Cargo cults emerge out of structures of marginalization, whereby a rural black population is rendered through its life-style and living con- ditions as separate and subordinate to a minority, largely urban, white population. Whereas the urban black population can to some extent share in the life-style of whites, this is much less the case for some rural subsistence populations like the bush Kaliai. Their consumption of white culture is minimal and they experience their removal from it as a loss.5 The peripheral context of subsistence societies must be seen not just as a failure by colonial capitalism to penetrate and integrate completely. Instead it can be seen as a structure that facilitates the reproduction of a labor supply at minimal administrative costs. The peripheral context of subsistence societies is therefore part of the structure of their colonial incorporation. Though each cultural side of this colonial process has its own relative autonomy, they meet not as equals, but through a hierarchical structure of encapsulation. The colonizing effects of world capitalism cannot be reduced to a simple process of totalization, involving the cumulative expansion of a homogenous totality. Instead, it is a process of colonial incorporation whereby capitalism first swallows and then regurgitates the relative autonomy of other cultures, reconstituting them in the process. Colonial encapsulation is certainly a political and economic process. It is also a cultural process conditioned by that exchange of meanings it sets up be- tween the different life worlds of those who govern and those who are governed. In this sense, it is a dialogical process, one involving a constant interaction of meanings belonging to different life worlds (Bakhtin 1981). In his first major eth- nography, The Devil and Commodity Fetishism in South America, Taussig char- acterized the colonial context as an interface between a precapitalist society, one</page><page sequence="3">232 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY with an anthropomorphic ideology based on "use value" and reciprocity, and a colonizing capitalist society where ideology and value assume an abstract ano- nymity (Taussig 1980). Terence Turner correctly criticized this characterization for being too sweeping and ahistorical (Turner 1986). Indeed, Taussig's theoret- ical schema is contradicted by his own South American material, where the he- gemonic language of the colonizing capitalist system was provided by the Church.6 Far from possessing an abstract impersonal view of the universe, the Church provides (in the capitalist colonial context) precisely that anthropo- morphic view of the universe supposedly characteristic of precapitalist societies. The material from West New Britain also does not support Taussig's global colonial theory. In West New Britain colonization has brought about a process of anthropomorphization, that is, a process of increasingly making human ancestors and the human form the center of cosmological creation. Alongside this is a re- lated movement toward a Christian patrilineal system. The colonial Church, with its patriarchal emphasis on "man" made in the image of God, is destroying a traditional matrilineal totemic system (cf. McDowell 1985). In traditional bush Kaliai mythology, birds, animals, and plants were cosmogonically central. These totems, which are transmitted through a mother's blood, are still seen by many as the maternal origins of humans. These totemic bloodlines are grouped together to form two matri-moieties referred to as Bogi (sea eagle) and Piraou (possibly a kingfisher) or bikpela pisin (big bird) and liklik pisin (small bird). These moieties are gendered male and female respectively, with members of opposite-gendered moieties marrying (cf. Counts 1972:379; Counts and Counts 1976:295; Rivers 1914:500-510; Wagner 1986:49-55). Marriage here is not just simply a marriage between a man and a woman but also a marriage between gendered groups, a marriage between their gendered signs. This is to say that the two moieties are part of an engendering binary logic that displaces reproduction into relationships between groups rather than simply those between individuals. In the case of men, in marrying a woman of the opposite moiety, a man is said to spawn and nurture the offspring of that opposite moiety. This becomes a gift and obligation that each moiety has to the other. In effect, each moiety reproduces itself through its op- posite (cf. Levi-Strauss 1969:69-83; Turner 1979; Wagner 1986:xvi-xvii). In this matrilineal moiety system, fathers do not share the same moiety as their children. As one father put it: "We men have no family." In the present Christian colonial context, some fathers experience this as a relationship of alien- ation. They argue that whites have got the right system and that children should be assigned to their father's "family" (that is, moiety). Alongside such views, there is currently some discussion over whether men's semen or women's blood is the most important substance in procreation. Some men argue, much to the disdain of other men, that woman's womb is simply an empty bilum (basket). Women retort that men's semen is wara nating (only water). One man, under the influence of Christian ideas, claimed that women giving birth was simply a trick, a deceptive appearance, and that in reality a male God creates the children and places them in women's wombs. He argued that because this process was hidden women could falsely claim credit for human procreation.</page><page sequence="4">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 233 Such statements refract colonial domination into a gender struggle over pro- creation. The privileging of women's blood in the traditional matri-moiety system becomes experienced as a fragmenting evil that alienates father from son and white culture from black culture. It is experienced by some as the punishment of a false culture, which is responsible for the backwardness of bush Kaliai exis- tence. Affirming male predominance in reproduction becomes the language for invoking the superior powers of production that whites are seen to control. The subordinate colonial position of indigenous culture produces a depreciated sense of its value and a rejection and abandonment of its means of reproduction. Another example of this is in the field of marriage. Traditionally the most preferred form of marriage was between cross-cousins. They reciprocally call each other by the distinctive term sedagu. They also refer to each other as luku which is what a brother and a sister reciprocally call each other. As in tok pisin (where a brother and a sister reciprocally call each other sista), among the bush Kaliai, cross-cousins of the opposite sex also call each other "sister" (sista, luku). Through marrying this special classificatory "sister" a man protects him- self from women's "poison."7 He marries someone close to him whom he can trust. Under colonialism this form of marriage comes to be experienced (especially by the young) as sinful, with the Christian church denouncing it as incest. Some bush Kaliai experience themselves as having fallen into animality, for like pigs and dogs they use their "sisters" as sexual partners. The particular reading the bush Kaliai give to Christian mythology accentuates this sense of fallenness, in- scribing it further into indigenous forms of reproduction. For Adam and Eve are interpreted as a brother and sister, whose fall came not from eating a fruit (this is a lie of the Church) but through illicit sexual intercourse. Reproduction through marrying one's "sister" comes to resonate with this indigenous interpretation of the Fall: both come to be viewed as illicit forms of sexuality that have operated to deny people access to some lost paradise. What is occurring here is a process of embodying one's cultural domination, encoding it into the relationships through which society reproduces itself. The problematic reproduction of traditional so- ciality that colonialism brings about comes to be refracted into images which problematize traditional relations of reproduction. Kaliai cargo cults have given this problematization of indigenous reproduc- tion different forms, having at various times rejected traditional ritual and cere- monial means of cultural reproduction. Traditional masks, spears, drums, and shields have been destroyed, gardening and the hunting of pigs have been aban- doned, and there have been attempts to abandon the purchasing of women with shell-money (Counts 1972:380; cf. Eves 1988:5; Williams 1976:351). The recent resurgence of cargo cult beliefs around the American missionaries at Amkor has taken the form of demands to abandon bride-price payments. The demand is for women to be free just as they are for whites. In this way, the colonial power of whites comes to be seen to be a product of their system of reproduction.8 The inscribing of the colonial power of whites into procreation is also a fea- ture of Kaliai cargo cult myths which claim that whites and blacks originated from</page><page sequence="5">234 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY coconuts. Many believe that present white power and wealth are derived from coconuts, in other words from white possession and control of the primordial pro- creative origins of humanity. I was told that coconuts originated in the Kaliai bush, but, because of the bikhet (that is, stubbornness, conceitedness, and diso- bedience) of the bush Kaliai, the creator transplanted them down to the coast, before leaving for the land of whites.9 The setting up of Iboki and other coconut plantations in New Britain by the first whites (Germans) has convinced some bush Kaliai that there is a close magical link between the power of whites and the pro- creative powers ascribed to coconuts.10 Here new symbols of cosmogenesis (that is, coconuts) are empowered by their location in a colonial exchange value con- text. This ability of coconuts to become a central part of cargo cult discourse is also partly the product of a widespread folklore concerning procreation and co- conuts. For coconuts are said to possess "grease," a euphemism for semen. Men claim that eating the white flesh of coconuts replenishes a man's stock of semen, which is seen as the basis of male strength and power (rice, which is seen as a white man's food, is also said to replenish semen). Here white power and wealth are figured as coming from white possession and control of the substance of male identity. Coconuts, however, also have a strong female symbolic component. They are likened to wombs containing amniotic fluid. Some cargo cult followers claimed that coconuts had their origin from the menstruating blood of a woman which fell onto the ground and that the first crop of coconuts were filled with blood. From two different species of these coconuts sprouted the separate white and black races. Censure, the cargo cult leader whose cult has been instrumental in spreading the story that humans originated from coconuts, initially assumed the name Kulau, a pidgin term for green coconuts. One of Censure's stories involves the ancestral hero, Kowdok (or, more frequently, Titikolo), taking coconuts away from the Kaliai interior and down to the coast and to whites. In traditional secret male mythology, it was Kowdok who took the tambarans, which women in- vented, away from women and gave them to men. Initiates are said to be swal- lowed into the tambaran's womb and reborn through its mouth. Kowdok reverses control over two disembodied forms of woman's reproductive powers, coconuts and tambarans. In the Kaliai area, there is therefore evidence that a radical rewriting of myth- ological history is occurring. There is evidence to suggest that villagers living currently along the northwest coast of West New Britain also participated previ- ously in a moiety system organized around pisin totems. That moiety system ap- pears to have been destroyed by the more complete incorporation of the coast into white colonial culture (Zelenietz and Grant 1986). The role of cargo cults in this transformation along the coast has yet to be investigated, but bush Kaliai cargo cults have certainly contributed to the colonial process of anthropomorphizing the culture of interior villages. Censure's cult, which I shall discuss here, grew out of a major cargo cult led by Aikele in the 1960s at Bibling Ridge. According to Censure and his followers, Aikele's cult</page><page sequence="6">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 235 was still organized around a totemic system that saw humans as descended from birds. Censure prides himself on having seen beyond his ancestors' naivetd, so as to recognize, like white Christians, the mythic centrality of humans in the creation process. Piraou and Bogi are not the origins of you and me. They are only birds. This is a "story-picture" [that is, an allegory]. Everyone talks that Bogi went around finding its line and that Piraou went around finding its line. Our ancestors did not know that you and me, everyone, came up from one mother. No way! Our ancestors only spoke of Piraou and Bogi, they did not know that us humans came from woman. They spoke that we came up from birds." Censure claims that at Bibling Ridge he spoke to a government patrol officer who carried Censure's knowledge to God where it was confirmed as correct. Censure claims that he and another man respectively called out the two human names of the first lilikpisin member and bikpela pisin member. These two names were said to be the indigenous equivalents of those whom whites call Adam and Eve. On the basis of naming the first mother of humanity, Censure acquired renown and began attracting followers. Later on, when he was interviewed by Father Janssen, Censure claimed his anthropomorphic view of the world was again confirmed and taken to God. Interviews by Dorothy Counts and myself were also incorporated by Censure into authorizing his cosmology and both of us have been assigned cargo cult names by him. Indeed, Censure claimed I was his returned dead son who had come to help him "out" (reveal) the new age of Law. Censure's rewriting of myths needs to be seen as a political activity. Censure sees membership of his cult as being held back by the longlong (stupid, silly) views of those who believe humans to be descended from totemic beings. Censure confronts the problem of how can the present be recreated and redeemed by hu- mans if cosmogenesis is seen to reside in birds? Censure's rewriting of myths is a way of politicizing the present. His recreation of the past in anthropomorphic terms operates to engage humans in the historical process of creation. To do this Censure must position totemic myths as literal and as absurd. By destroying the totemic tradition, Kaliai villagers emerge directly as historical actors, as those who can assume responsibility for the origin of society. The rewriting of mythic narratives in anthropomorphic terms destroys the sense of mythic time as a sealed off time (cf. Bakhtin 1981:15-18). Using Bakhtin, we can say that it subverts one of the ideological effects of a totemic tradition which is to construct the epic world as "an utterly finished thing. The epic world is constructed in the zone of an ab- solute distanced image, beyond the sphere of possible contact with the develop- ing, incomplete and therefore re-thinking and re-evaluating present" (1981:17). Cargo cults in making mythic time cosubstantial with human time render mythic time repeatable and the present world is rendered susceptible to transformation through the power and promise of cult ritual practices. Censure's rewriting of myths allows an empowering of present human existence; a calling forth of its creative energies. His anthropomorphization of myths allows present humans to</page><page sequence="7">236 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY come into contact and to be empowered by the creative formative powers ascribed to the epic world of myth.12 Nearly all bush Kaliai cargo cult myths are centered on an ancestral hero called Titikolo. Though a trickster, he was also a teacher. This was misunderstood by the ancestors. They wronged him and he ran away to friendly America. He gave the Americans their present knowledge and power, while his black kinsmen received the punishment of remaining in poverty and ignorance. In one version of the "Story," Titikolo received the sister of an American who befriended him. In return and through this woman, Titikolo created the present living standard of whites. Here the sexual interface and union created by marriage becomes the imagined source of that space of plenitude whites inhabit. The marriage of man and woman is simultaneously the marriage of black and white, with the wealth of whites being the "child" of this marriage. This reenacts the matrilineal logic of the moiety system where the (black) father (and his group) is alienated from the produce of the marriage he labors for. In another version of the "Story," this woman who created the present living standard of whites is said to be a black woman (cf. McDowell 1985:35). Referred to as belonging to the same liklik pisin moiety as Titikolo she is in effect his sister. A major theme of some cargo cult narratives is the return of this original mother or another woman who will compensate for this original loss. In part, colonialism here comes to be figured as an uncompensated appropriation of the doubling pow- ers of women's sexuality. The bikhet of our ancestors wronged this man and he ran away to America and they are now happy. Why are they happy? Because they received a woman. God worked a "gate" for them. Now they have food. The origin of all this is with woman only. Woman only got up the law. We have not got food. We exist with death. Censure's anthropomorphization of the universe has served to collapse the powers of cosmogenesis into the reproductive powers of woman. In his myth, the afflu- ence of white culture is seen to be derived from the exchange of a woman between men. The reification and celebration of woman's reproductive powers is tradi- tionally constituted on those occasions (like marriage) when a woman is ex- changed between men (cf. Weiner 1980). It is her transfer that empowers the pro- creative capacities of another moiety and village. Likewise for whites, the move- ment of her procreativity between groups has empowered their productive capac- ities. Marilyn Strathern points out correctly that in Melanesia "women's labour and fertility . . . are objectified in exchanges between men" (Strathern 1987:5- 6). Woman is celebrated to the extent that she mediates an interface between men. Her reproductive powers are fetishized in those interfaces between men she sets up. Likewise, one of Censure's proposals was that he (as a member of liklik pisin) and I (as a member of bikpela pisin) reenact the original mythic scene where Ti- tikolo, an American, and a woman created the cargo belonging to whites. I was to stand on the side close to the coast (that is, the side associated with Western influence, the side of the American), he would stand on the side of the bush (the</page><page sequence="8">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 237 side of Titikolo), while a woman would stand in the middle of us and throw her hand from which the cargo belonging to the Kaliai would magically appear. In this scene of magic, woman's ability to create emerges from her being situated spatially between men. She is empowered by the relations between men, the movement of her procreative powers being realized through those historical scenes men position her within. Noticeable also in the above scene of magic is the strong presence of binary opposites. Bush versus coast, highland versus lowland, black versus white, prim- itive wildness versus Western civilization, rulers versus ruled, liklik pisin versus bikpela pisin, and perhaps most important female versus male, are the binary op- posites put into cosmological play in this colonial context. They form the semiotic space of the cargo cult, its primordial categories for charting and mediating the mythic space of colonialism. They are the categories deployed to reach out for a world history: an indigenous world history firmly rooted in the binary logic of gender which is also the binary logic of the bush Kaliai moiety system. That bi- nary logic is deployed in order to understand colonialism as an unequal exchange between two sides. Though Censure's influential "Story" cult is highly critical of notions of humans being descendants of birds, it continues to use the binary logic of the traditional moiety system. Significantly, colonialism is itself predicated upon a logic of binary opposition. The binary structure of colonialism refers to the dis- junctures and asymmetries it creates between whites and blacks, rulers and ruled, coast and bush, those who own capitalist means of production versus those who do not. These binary opposites of colonialism are its segmentary structure. Co- lonialism cannot exist without some form of racial and spatial segmentation of its population. Its structures of economic and political hierarchy require a population that can be divided into segments that receive different apportionments of wealth and power. This is what I mean by the segmentary structure of colonialism. What is distinctive about colonialism is that this segmentation of a population into sep- arate segregated economic classes is primarily codified as one of racial power. The white-black dichotomy gives the divisions of colonialism a distinctly binary symbolic logic. What is characteristic about bush Kaliai cargo cults is the way they symbol- ically feed off the binary structures of colonialism. Indeed as the above scene of magic demonstrated, the binary opposites of colonialism coalesce with the binary logic of the traditional moiety system. The current moiety system of the bush Ka- liai is not just a fossilized remnant of tradition, which exists on the basis of inertia. The dyadic moiety logic is empowered and reproduced as a political discourse by the binary structure of the colonial context. Colonialism has incorporated the bi- nary logic of the bush Kaliai into wider structures and logics of segmentation. This is the hegemonic space of colonialism: its ability to fold one set of binary opposites upon another, empowering its own segmentary structure through a par- allel empowerment of indigenous binary segments and logics.13 In refracting and reproducing within its own internal structure a binary logic it simultaneously dominates, colonialism reconstitutes the field of application of</page><page sequence="9">238 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY that indigenous binary logic into a political language about colonial power. This is the space of cargo cult rituals and narratives. The process of folding one set of binary opposites upon another creates the possibilities of new readings capable of accounting for the structure of colonialism while simultaneously relativizing the colonists as only one bipolar term in a logic of complementary opposition. The presence of so many bikpela pisin totems, namely eagles and cassowaries (that is, emus), on military and government insignia has led whites to be identified by some with the moiety of bikpela pisin and the Kaliai with the complementary moiety of liklik pisin. 4 Colonialism in effect empowers a logic of opposition, one capable of being used politically to generate and occupy a complementary oppo- sitional space to whites. For many bush Kaliai the presence of moiety totems (like the eagle, cassowary, pig, and wallaby) on monetary notes and on government insignia has meant that images of colonial power are fused with, and seen to be derived from, the oppositional logic of the moiety system. Indeed, colonialism has come to be figured as reproducing and constituting its power within the dyadic gender terms of an indigenous moiety logic. One old man pointed to the image of the emu and kangaroo facing each other on Australian coins. He claimed the emu was a cassowary and represented bikpela pisin, while the kangaroo was a wallaby and represented liklik pisin. Many disputed his claim that the totem wallaby belonged to the liklik pisin moiety. However he was ada- mant, and refuted their claim with the proof that the image of the two moieties was also stamped on all (Australian) cargo. These two moieties are symbolically male and female and marry each other. For the old man, the power of whites resided in the procreative powers of a moiety system, in that sexual interface cre- ated by its binary-gendered logic. All of Censure's rituals and his vast mytholog- ical classification of the world are organized to reproduce this sexual interface. For example, in Censure's cult currently a flagpole features prominently, with the two moieties of liklik pisin and bikpela pisin singing and dancing around it. At- tached to the top of the flagpole is a string: bikpela pisin members hold one end of the string while liklik pisin members hold its other end. While I was at Meta- vala, a pig characterized as belonging to liklik pisin was hoisted up the flagpole and sacrificed so as to bring on the new utopia. A pig belonging to bikpela pisin had already been sacrificed previously. The two moieties, in being symbolically male and female, displace the act of reproduction into relationships between groups, and thus into a wider spatio-temporal symbolic domain. The fusion of images of white power with the wider spatio-temporal domain of displaced repro- duction between moiety groups is a statement about that wider spatio-temporal realm of causality the cargo cult seeks to operate within. Censure's cult plays with this semiotic structure of binary-gendered opposites so as to engender a new space of creative power. In the hope of discovering the new "law" that will deliver the age of cargo, Censure continuously dreams up new dances and songs for the members of liklik pisin and bikpela pisin to enact. Censure searches for a hidden power of meta- morphosis, a hidden power of procreation, in a new ritual coupling of gender op- posites. The moiety system's logic of pairing offers a generative logic for going</page><page sequence="10">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 239 beyond the present. The logic of moiety system marriage, where each moiety re- produces itself through its gendered opposite, is projected onto the colonial field of white and black relationships. Whites become, relative to the Kaliai, the en- gendering other through which one can go beyond present existence. Perhaps this is the reason that Kaliai cargo cults are not a simple rejection of white culture, but are structured around the incorporation of what are believed to be certain empowering aspects of white culture.15 Kaliai cargo cults are not a pas- sive incorporation into the hegemony of white culture. In the ritual practices and discourse of Kaliai cults, white culture becomes an empowering space capable of being appropriated to authorize an autonomy to the hegemony of white culture. For example, though Censure's cult contains a flag, it is made of bark cloth and painted with two birds, representing the two moieties. Here a symbol of white colonial power (a flag) is made to empower the moiety symbols of indigenous culture. Followers pointed out that flags were found on government cars, ships, planes, and offices. The dancing of liklik and bikpela pisin cult followers around the flagpole mimicked the marching and saluting of the military and the police (cf. Cochrane 1970).16 In such images the cargo cult seeks the magical nature of white power. The cargo cult draws on the logic of traditional magical practices, where one incorporates the symbolic image of what one desires to operate upon or produce. The cargo cult draws upon the symbolic fetishisms of power in the colonizing culture to provide new symbolic magical practices capable of dissolv- ing the inequalities of colonialism. The cult's symbolic appropriation of state rit- uals is an appropriation of the anthropomorphic displays through which colonial power materializes itself, renders itself visible and factual. Censure's cult uses Western ritual codifications of power to heal and efface the continuing pain of colonial inequalities. The cargo cult searches inside the ritual symbolism of co- lonial culture for its reproductive secrets and powers. Control over reproduction is one of the major political idioms of the bush Kaliai (Lattas 1991a, 1991b). In the present colonial context it is used as a lan- guage for articulating resistances to white culture. There exists a strong sense of whites and their officials as a disordering power on indigenous reproduction. This was the thrust of Aikele's opposition to people joining the new local government Council structure. Aikele has apparently said that if the people remain on the Kandrian side they will be forced to join the Council. He says that if they join the Council they will not have enough money to pay Council tax and their women will have to work as prostitutes to get money enough to pay the tax. [Patrol Report, 27 June 1966, Gloucester] Incorporation into new state structures is here seen as heralding the subversion of morally ordered sexuality. More than just a way of frightening followers into his cult, Aikele's prophecy also reveals a profound opposition to money and to white administrative structures. Perhaps what is being opposed is that new placing of identity the state enacts through the geography of its new administrative units. Those administrative units, in determining the boundaries of new corporate groups (other than those of village, kinship, moiety, and language group affilia-</page><page sequence="11">240 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY tion), create new "territorial" spaces for positioning male personhood. In effect colonialism enacts a reterritorialization of cultural identity. The state's creation of new spaces for identity, new sites for the positioning of male selfhood, is sym- bolically transformed into a loss over the control of woman, that gendered other who is traditionally so important for the positioning of the male self. Gender iden- tity constituted through men's control of procreation becomes the primary meta- phor for figuring that problematization of cultural identity created by new colonial boundaries. The loss of traditional ways of figuring the male self comes to be metaphorized into a loss of traditional control over women and their procreative powers. Currently, economic development is often criticized by the bush Kaliai as loosening traditional male marital control over female sexuality. Those critical of bisnis claim it leads to promiscuity, the prostitution of women, and to the resulting disputes between men who might seek vengeance through fighting with spears. Bush Kaliai men are conscious of maintaining the sexual boundaries of their women. They are highly critical of visiting government and church officials who "like to come and 'pump' [that is, have sexual intercourse] inside us." Some of the major stories people tell concern physical battles between themselves and vis- iting outsiders who have taken liberties with their women. Women's sexual boundaries become a metaphor, indeed a site, for the boundary of the group; for that autonomy it seeks from the penetrations of outside others, from that subor- dinate receiving position implied in being penetrated (Lattas 1991b). Procreation here operates as a site for giving coherence to the posited disordering powers of colonialism. Misreading Colonialism: Gender, Procreation, and Metaphors of Power An inadequate view of cargo cults would see them simply as haphazard mis- representations and distortions of white culture produced by the peripheral situa- tion of bush Kaliai villages. Such a view ignores the strategic nature of misread- ings, that misreadings are interpretations produced within a field of power rela- tions. Misreadings represent not so much a lack of knowledge of white culture as an appropriation of its meanings for the creation of new imaginative spaces and dialogues. Kaliai cargo cults represent a process of listening to Christian mythol- ogy in order to usurp its truth, its language, its authority, so as to occupy its place, that is, so as to fill its place with an alternative stance, with other ways of reading colonial identities. To view whites, as one Kaliai cargo cult leader does, as having emerged from the sexual intercourse of a snake with the virgin Mary is a powerful decon- structive reading of biblical mythology. While it is incorporation into white cul- ture, it is also an act of discourse piracy, an act of "poaching" (Morris 1988:4). This is to say that it is an appropriation and reconstitution of biblical theology, which turns the language of one's colonizers against them. It is a revelatory state- ment about the nature of whites, of the false truths they spread which disguise their true serpentine origins.</page><page sequence="12">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 241 This myth fits into a number of other cultural constructions of whites. People claimed their grandfathers viewed whites as cannibals and would not eat the tinned meat of whites because they feared they were being tricked into eating hu- man flesh. I was told the first white men were regarded as masalai, which are monstrous beings that devour humans. Masalai are often seen as capable of chang- ing into both a human and a snakelike form. The clothes of whites were seen as analogous to the skins snakes shed. Recently, when the American missionaries from Amkor came upon a man washing at Salke, he was momentarily terrified because he thought they might be masalai. Indeed, the same indigenous words used for masalai are also used for whites. In the coastal language of Lusi the word is pura while in the Mouk language it is iriao (cf. Counts and Counts 1976:294). In this semantic identification, whites are equated with those quasi-demonic beings that, in many bush Kaliai narratives, destroy the reproductive organs of humans. Masalai are monstrous beings of trickery that are able to change into a human form, often taking the form of one's spouse. Through this deception, in- dividuals are tricked into sexual intercourse that produces bleeding in their geni- talia and death. Masalai, like whites, are seen to have enormous destructive sexual appetites and organs. One popular story tells of how a woman sat upon a large boulder underneath which a masalai was hiding. The masalai's penis went straight through the boulder and into the woman's vagina, fastening her fatally to the boul- der. Interestingly, if bananas, taro, or some other garden produce grows extraor- dinarily large it will also be referred to as iriao or masalai and thrown away. Any- one eating it or something grown on a known masalai area endangers their chil- dren's lives. In a sense that which is too powerful becomes destructive of human procreation. This is the monstrous imagery of white colonization. The identifi- cation of whites as masalai beings who attack reproductive organs is also inscribed in stories that old men tell about the first white settlers, the Germans, and their punishment. A disobedient man would be stood naked by a tree with a small hole in it, he would be hit hard on the backside such that his penis would be forced into the hole. Likewise, women were punished with strokes which forced their geni- talia onto phallus-shaped wood. What is important is not the truth or falsehood of these stories, but their circulation. They represent a folklore ideology which nar- rativizes colonial social relationships in the assigned truth that whites are antitheti- cal to procreation. This imagery of whites as standing in opposition to indigenous procreative powers is also embodied in a widespread belief that with the coming of whites everything seems to be getting smaller. Many bush Kaliai people claimed their grandparents were larger than present people, being taller and fatter. Men were stronger, able to break trees and stones with the throw of a spear. Likewise it was argued that taro grew larger and gardens were more productive. Some attributed the decline of gardens to the replacement of stone axes with steel axes, others to the coming of the church. What runs through all such statements is a notion of the increasing loss of procreative powers possessed by the ancestors, that the loss of indigenous culture and the substitution of a new one is threatening indigenous culture's ability to reproduce itself (cf. Clark 1986; Johnson 1981; Jorgensen 1985).</page><page sequence="13">242 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Women's Procreative Powers and Cargo Cult Ideology Cargo cults take up this language of a denied and repressed indigenous pro- creative power. For many, present existence has resulted from the lost procreative powers of a black woman whom whites received. Here the sense of lost procrea- tive power inscribed in discussions about people becoming smaller and gardens less fertile is refracted into the loss of an original mother. She becomes the hidden indigenous repressed truth of colonialism. She stands as an effacement of the power of whites, their claims to create order and to possess the ultimate knowl- edge of creation-the patriarchal God. Discussing Melanesian societies, Marilyn Strathern writes that: "What is striking . . . is not the immutability of gender, but its transactability. Contrasts between men and women become a vehicle for the creation of value: for evalu- ating one set of powers by reference to another" (Strathern 1987:7). Among the bush Kaliai, gender has become a metaphor for figuring colonialism. Gender pro- vides an ideology of difference through which the inequalities of colonialism can be understood. The differences between the procreative powers of men and women are the conceptual means for evaluating the power of whites relative to the procreative powers of the bush Kaliai. In the Christian colonizing church it is the male patriarchal God who reigns procreatively supreme: He creates the world and humanity, His word becomes the law and creates order. The Metavala cult reverses this genderization of origins, privileging woman instead as the origin of all existence and especially of the liv- ing standards of whites. This black woman whom whites received and who is the real God has many names, including Tamasina and Piraou. The latter name is the name of the female gendered moiety of liklik pisin. Everything has its origins with a mother, everything comes from one woman, Piraou. She is the hand of God. She is the true God. Everything, whites, me, animals, trees came from her. Everyone talks "God! God!," but in America woman made the law come up. In the Metavala cult, a sense of being deceived by whites is combined with a celebration of women's reproductive powers so as to produce a set of strategic misreadings of biblical theology. When discussing the creation of Adam and Eve out of the earth, cult followers denied vehemently that man was created first. Moreover, cult followers went on to reinterpret the creator as female. They said that the Americans call God "Jesus,'' but when "you come back to the Ground," God is called Mary Tamasina. Mary Tamasina for us is Jesus. The Church's claim of Jesus being a man is a lie. They are working "talk picture" (that is, imaginative or deceptive talk). In "talk picture" they say Jesus is a man, but Jesus is a woman. Everything belongs to mother, to mother only. We men are beings who sing out for things to come, for this to come, for that to come. We sing out like that. But food comes from woman, food came up from woman, all cargo, everything came up only from woman. In "talk picture" Jesus is a man, but no way Jesus is Tamasina-a woman who works food.</page><page sequence="14">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 243 When asked whether something in fact did not come up from a male God, Censure emphasized again the above point. It came up from her only. She threw her hand money came up, she threw her hand this way and something else came up. Piraou worked all this, the Big Man sat down, all this came up from woman. The Metavala cult's privileging of woman's role in sociogenesis parallels traditional secret male mythology. It asserts that the secret ritual objects of male power, the tambarans, originated from women and were stolen from women by men (Lattas 1991a; cf. Bamberger 1974). Men in traditional mythology are po- sitioned as usurpers, while woman is positioned as creator. She is the hidden cos- mogonic power, the concealed truth of origins. Woman's nurturing and child- bearing roles are taken to be everyday instantiations of her cosmogonic mythic role as creator. Her corporeality embodies and is emblematic of her original power to create sociality. In cargo cults, colonial politics becomes a dialogue about procreation; a dis- cursive struggle to possess and to be redeemed through the procreative powers of woman (cf. Taussig 1987:232). Cargo cults link women's nurturing role in gar- dening, childbearing, and domestic chores, that is her everyday role in creating and sustaining life, with the cosmogonic process of historically creating a "new law," a new way of existence. This is what women prominent in the Metavala cargo cult had to say: Law exists with all women. Women all bring food. Food comes from women, from the ground. You, men, sing out for food, but we, women, food belongs to us, it comes from us, women. Food comes from women. She carries family. Cargo comes from women. This privileging of woman's reproductive powers in Kaliai cargo cults par- allels the initial experience of colonialism in the bush Kaliai area, where women came to bear the brunt of the labor of gardening and child-rearing. Patrol reports from the 1960s indicate that often one-third of the men left their wives and chil- dren to go to work on plantations (nowadays wives and children are likely to go with men to plantations, though not always). In having made women the basis of village life, that is, in rendering women central to reproducing its labor force, colonialism creates the conditions which validate an ideology that privileges women's reproductive powers. In effect, Metavala cult uses the subordinate po- sition of woman in society as a metaphor for an experience of colonialism as re- pressing the means of cultural reproduction. Apart from being situated within the colonial politics of white-black rela- tions, Kaliai bush cargo cults are also situated within the politics of gender rela- tions. The cult's valorization of women's productive and reproductive powers and its construction of men as appropriators of what woman produces ("You, men, sing out for food, but we, women, food belongs to us, it comes from us, women") has made it popular among women. Women still prominent in the cult claimed</page><page sequence="15">244 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY that many women wanted to return to the cult but were being prevented by their husbands. Many men claimed that they had been pulled into the cult by women. In the Metavala cult, women play a central role in the dancing and singing which is seen to be the new "law" that will usher in the new age of prosperity and equal- ity. They [the women] must throw their legs here and there and their hands here and there. This is because the law is in our legs and in our hands. Our legs work it and our hands work it. This is its meaning. Its meaning is as we spoke yesterday, that woman will stand up and open the law out. That is why women sing. In the middle of Metavala village there is a small "mountain" which is said to have been quite large when the cargo cult had many followers and to have shrunk with the cult's decline. This mound is said to contain the primordial mother who is said to be in hiding. This is the mountain of the mother of you and me. Before it was big. It came up by itself, swelled up. When all the men ran away it became small. Previous followers of the cult have interpreted the mountain as a womb, as the swollen stomach of a pregnant woman. It is the womb of the maternal earth, sym- bolic of the earth's procreative powers. From it the cargo will come. Referring to the age of cargo, Censure spoke: Papua New Guinea wants to but the as [that is, source, origin, base] of the ground is afraid. If the as of the ground was well, strong, then Papua New Guinea would be alright. The as of the ground is buggered up. It is like this, if this woman will stand up, she will pull the law into the outside. Woman, here, is the as of the ground, what is basic and fundamental about it: "Food exists with women, with the ground." Censure's cargo cult continu- ously oscillates between being directed at a primordial mother and at the earth, for the two operate as extensions of each other. She personifies the earth, it ob- jectifies her. Censure angrily denounced his follower for speaking: "Hurry up! hurry up! What time will it come up? When will we see it?" Now this talk makes me sad. Now this something, the ground, do you think it is a small child. The earth requires a respectful gestating period. She must be coaxed and seduced into relinquishing her wealth. Pigs are sacrificed for this purpose. In constructing the procreative earth of West New Britain as the origin of everything, Kaliai cargo cults undermine a colonial context which seems to imply that supreme power comes from lands outside of West New Britain. Instead whites become the supreme male appropriators of the wealth of woman in her objectified form as ground. Before when we were ignorant all white men, all Australians, knew how to "pocket" out of something belonging to Stone Sakali.</page><page sequence="16">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 245 Stone Sakali refers to the island of New Britain. Stone Sakali is also the original starting place of all creation and is said to make the ground strong, as well as those who are above it. Stone Sakali contains within itself all the money and other val- uables which have conferred wealth and power to whites. The first issue of money with political independence, kina, whites are said to have pocketed. A new issue of money referred to as mani dabol ("money double") is promised by the cargo cult. Now at this time everyone talks "Papua New Guinea is boss. You work for money." Stone Sakali is still the same. Money kina has come up but the white skins got it all. Money dabol has not yet come out at Stone Sakali. Mani kina is said to be "bossed" by a woman belonging to the moiety of liklik pisin while mani dabol is said to be "bossed" by a woman belonging to the moiety of bikpela pisin. These two forms of money refer to two different forms of clamshells. Kina refers to a white clamshell found in mangroves. Importantly it is found on coastal locations which are associated with plantations, trade stores, and patrol posts; in short white colonial influence. Its whiteness is metaphorical of the wider white power structure which circulates and controls its value. On the other hand, dabol is the name of a black colored clamshell found in rivers, that is, in waterways associated with those peripheral to the penetrating influence of capitalism. It is this new issue of money which promises the new age of prosper- ity. Its associated blackness symbolizing it being the hidden wealth belonging to the indigenous black population, their repressed value. As the opposite of white, it threatens to reverse the present colonial structure which is seen to be based on the restricted circulation and control of monetary value by whites. This new money offers a new value structure. Money dabol is family money. This has not come up yet. It is the time of kina now. Kina is one thing, dabol is another. When we buy something with one note of money dabol we would finish [purchase] the whole store. The clam iconography of both of these forms of money makes them strongly emblematic of woman. Clamshells are seen to be analogous to the female vagina, with the rubbery-like muscle part of the flesh being likened in jokes to the clitoris. When eating such shellfish men sometimes tease women that they are eating their vaginas and make bawdy jokes about the gris moa yet (that is, vaginal secretions) of the soup of such shellfish. The woman (Kewak) who discovered how to create the noise belonging to the tambaran, Varku, was said to have been chased into the sea by her brother (Kowdok) where her vagina turned into a clamshell. Such sym- bolic references transform money into an objectification of woman's procreative form, with the strong metaphorical implication being that the consumption of money is the consumption,of woman. In the Kaliai area, woman is the vehicle and object of traditional exchange relations. She is the procreative power which a community purchases, with men literally saying that the bride-price is buying a vagina. Here woman's reproduc-</page><page sequence="17">246 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY tive powers are fetishized in the moment of her exchange. In the colonial context, money in the symbolic metaphorical form of vaginal clamshells (kina) continues the process of fetishizing woman's reproductive powers through exchange rela- tions. Indeed money is an emblem of woman's procreative power. It is her disem- bodied procreative power that is circulated as value. For the bush Kaliai, woman is emblematic of value because she is the producer of all value. The objectification of something as valuable is derived from it being a displaced representation of her. She is the hidden presence and origin of those values men put into circulation. Kina came up with independence. I only know that when the flag came up clear, this money came up. It is not as though Papua New Guinea works this money, that the black men create it. No way! A being who exists with the Creator works this money. It is a woman called Ali. It is this woman who throws up [that is, vomits up] this money. Money exists at her feet and head. Money dabol is to be found at her head, money kina is at her feet. Ali is the traditional name given to a woman initiated into the secrets of the male tambaran Varku. This initiation ritual has died out. Such an initiated woman never saw the secret trickery of Varku (that is, the bull-roarer and mask). She underwent the ritual with her head covered and inside a sleeping mat. Ali was said to assume a position of male power with respect to other women and to be an ally of men. Likewise, in cargo cult ideology, she participates in the secret power of the masculinized side of the colonial segmentary structure. She is figured as par- ticipating in the secret reproductive powers of whites, vomiting up money for them. This parallels the tambaran Varku's ritual during which this monstrous being is said to vomit up initiates after having first swallowed them into its womb. This is explicitly likened to a process of birth, with initiates referring to Varku as their "mother." Ali is sometimes referred to as a mother of Varku. Some say Ali found the original mask of Varku, that part of Varku known as "Varku's mother." Ali reenacts Varku's ritual scene of monstrous birth for whites. It is she who has relieved whites from the burden of work and given birth to their age of plenty. You do not receive money from the government, you receive it only from the factory of this woman who works this something. She must be close to you. You are not enough to work money, no way! In talk picture we say "The Big Man [that is, creator] spoke," however the woman who works this is close to you. Such a cosmology disenfranchises whites (and in particular white men) of procreative power. They emerge as supreme appropriators of woman's reproduc- tive powers. This parallels traditional Kaliai myths where male power comes from the monstrous tambarans which men originally stole from women and through which men now give rebirth to themselves during rituals. Men have instituted lies to protect this theft which is the secret of their power. Likewise, locals claimed whites had instituted lies to protect the true sources of their power (cf. Counts 1972:380; Counts and Counts 1976:294). The lies were likened to the fence which</page><page sequence="18">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 247 men build to keep women ignorant of the fact that the masks are only a deception. Here whites are positioned as male tricksters who work monstrous deceptions, while the subordinate "ignorant" status of the local population positions them as female. Here the traditional asymmetries between men and women, which are mediated by a culture of monstrous trickery, are used to conceptualize the mon- strous asymmetries of colonialism. Behind the fences they build to hide their trickery, Kaliai men eat secretly the food which women bring to feed the mask. This is part of men's identification with the monstrosities of the tambaran: Us, men, are the tambaran. We eat the pig. In this vein, villagers noted the fences which the missionaries at Amkor built around their houses and the taboo placed on any locals entering their houses and sharing food with them. Like Kaliai men, whites were seen to be preserving a secret consumptive space. Whites, in general, are figured as having built a fence of secrecy behind which they eat at the expense of sharing with other races. Like Kaliai men, to preserve a position of privilege, whites perpetrate deceptions, such as telling false biblical myths and tearing out the important first pages of the bible (cf. Counts and Counts 1976:294). Part of Censure's cult involved building a fence behind which the spirits of the dead would eat. Those ancestral spirits were often seen to be white (Counts and Counts 1976:300; cf. Williams 1976:342). The white missionaries at Amkor were regarded initially as returned ancestors. At one stage money was pooled together to purchase the lost "law" that went to the Americans. The Japanese were said to have already purchased it and had as a result acquired immortality. Money, as the displaced procreative power of woman, offers a magical means of escaping from death into the utopia of perpet- ual life. Immortality is a quality ascribed to such creatures as snakes and crayfish, which because they shed their skins are said to renew themselves. It is important to recall that whites were seen originally as shedding their skins (that is, clothes). They are now said to sell the "law" of immortality to other nations, with many seeing this as the source of the wealth of whites. Whites have become merchants of life and death. Inscribed in such beliefs is a perception of one's race as con- demned to death by the inequalities of colonialism, by a system that has com- modified life itself. Colonialism comes to be experienced as living with the punishment of death. Against this cargo cults draw upon images of rebirth and renewal. Censure's cargo cult followers claimed that he received his knowledge from sexual intercourse with two female tambarans, said to be the spirits of his sister and mother.17 The resulting mixture of vaginal secretions and semen he rubbed all over his body, especially on his forehead and genitalia. This gave Censure his oracular knowl- edge. His personhood became embodied with knowledge. Since then he has re- fused to wash, saying he will do so only when the cargo has arrived.</page><page sequence="19">248 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY This story contains similar rebirth imagery as that found in traditional tam- baran initiation rituals, during which an initiate refers to the tambaran as "mother." After being schooled by the tambaran in knowledge, the initiate has oil rubbed onto his skin. This oil is likened to the birth fluid of a newborn child. The initiate is said to be swallowed into the tambaran's womb and reborn by being vomited out of the mouth which schooled him in knowledge.18 The initiate ac- quires a new name to mark his new identity as a man of knowledge who now has the power to enforce the laws of a village. Likewise, Censure through his inces- tuous relationship with his tambaranic mother acquired a new name, new knowl- edge, and a new law by which to live. The procreative solution Censure rubbed onto his skin is analogous to the "birth fluid" initiates are oiled with. The tam- barans that men stole from women are imaginary wombs by which men in rituals give rebirth to themselves with superior male identities. At the beginning of an initiation ritual, an initiate is referred to as the "tambaran's child"; after initiation he is referred to as mahrva ilou, the "tambaran's father." Censure's leadership and power are partly constituted through such symbolic references. To the extent that the story of Censure of rubbing the vaginal secretions of his mother onto his own skin mimes the rebirth ritual of Varku, then to that extent, Censure moves symbolically like the initiate from being the "tambaran's child" (in this case the child of his own mother) to becoming the "father" of this maternal tambaran. In effect Censure reclaims back the conditions of his own origins so as to go beyond the starting point of his own existence. More than simply a spokesman for wom- en's reproductive powers, Censure absorbs those powers into his own person- hood. The mixture of semen/vaginal secretions that gave him his knowledge is the procreative power of the knowledge he gained from women. He has absorbed that knowledge into himself. Censure, like other major traditional male mythic heroes (Kowdok and Ti- tikolo), belongs to the female-gendered moiety of liklik pisin. The creative trans- formations these male heroes enact are iconic with their symbolic femaleness. These heroes articulate a masculine codification of female reproductive power. One old man claimed that all bush Kaliai cult leaders belonged to the liklik pisin moiety. Though this statement is incorrect, it nevertheless reveals a perceived close association between the female gendered moiety and the ability of men to enact those wholesale transformations of the world, which are normally associ- ated with myths. Censure is perceived by his followers and himself as the new male bearer of the female cosmogonic process of creation. Recently when a woman cargo cultist (who was previously part of Censure's movement) tried to form her own cargo cult, she was on a number of occasions severely beaten and even raped by men. They experienced her as a threat to their political power. In the cargo cults it is men who must articulate the repressed power of woman as a political ideology. At the same time as this ideology celebrates women, it must also incorporate and dominate women. Indeed Kaliai cargo cults can be seen as a way of reconstituting traditional male dominance in the new context of colonialism. Kaliai cargo cults represent a new symbolic means of men appropriating women's reproductive powers so as to authorize their domination of women.19</page><page sequence="20">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 249 In traditional secret male mythology, women found the instruments of male power (that is, the tambarans). I have pointed out how the tambarans men stole from women become in a ritual context privileged wombs that allow men to en- gage in procreation outside of women's bodies (cf. Bettelheim 1955:199-200; Dundes 1976; Hiatt 1971, 1975; Ortner 1974; R6heim 1945:198). In everyday life the tambarans, which women created, are part of a culture of terror whereby men enforce women's obedience to men through the threat that misbehaving women will be eaten by the tambaran (cf. Counts 1968:152; Tuzin 1974:324, 331). In short (through the mythological form of the tambaran) woman is made to create the conditions of her own domination. The theft of the tambarans allows men to appropriate and to subsume the symbolic power ascribed to female repro- ductive processes, transforming female reproductive power into a means of re- producing male power (Lattas 199 la). Likewise, at Metavala, women found all the cult's important instruments of power. Censure (as a male) has privileged access and control over those instru- ments as part of the process of authorizing his own power and that of other men in his cult. Women are reported to have found a hole in the ground, which because of the noises coming from it, was believed to contain an engine and a workshop. This hole was also referred to as a "telephone," a "wireless" and as the "door" to God. Through it Censure communicated with female beings. They taught him how to speak a new language which he claims to be English. This pseudo-English language has placed Censure above his followers, in a realm of prophetic meaning which stands outside them. It has all the authority of that secret language of power which whites speak and which locals find so hard to learn. The women also found a piece of iron in the ground which was believed to be a piece of a hidden railway. When unearthed at the right time, it would also reveal a ladder that would let the dead return from hiding in the ground, carrying cargo for their descendants. The "telephone," the "engine," the "workshop" have all been found by women in a mother earth. The cult incorporates the symbols of Western power (telephone, engine, workshop) but within an ontology of power which renders white power, like indigenous male power, a usurpation of what woman creates. In this ontology of existence, colonial power represents new ways of possessing woman, new ways of displacing her procreative powers into the control of men. Conclusion In opposition to Christianity, for many bush Kaliai people, creation is not a product of a male creator but illustrative of the creative power embodied by woman. Such beliefs also challenge the Christian notion of a sacred procreative outside realm (for example, heaven, the garden of Eden, or God) which is re- moved from worldly procreation. If cargo cults celebrate (a black) woman, it is a counterhegemonic strategy that celebrates an inward and substantive indigenous power rather than an outward transcendental colonizing power. For them pro- creation is much too substantial, too embodied, to be transcendental. What Kaliai cargo cults reveal is that woman is God, that what underpins the shifting, chang-</page><page sequence="21">250 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY ing diverse forms of existence is the begetting power of woman. She provides the universe with its organic connectedness. Woman operates cosmogonically differently from a male God who creates while remaining physically separated from what He creates. Woman has a more organic relationship to procreation. She is its immanent embodiment rather than its transcendental source. She represents a negation of the other worldliness of Christian colonialism. Her everyday birth and nurturing powers are instantiations of her original cosmogonic powers. Woman's sexuality is situated within and made to be the bearer of an alternative cosmography of procreation and power. Dorothy Counts, who worked in the coastal Kaliai village of Kandoka, points correctly to the importance of Peter Lawrence and Bidney's view that cargo cults occur in cultures which do not separate the supernatural from the empirical world. We must dismiss at once the concept of the supernatural: a realm of existence not only apart from but also on a higher plane than the physical world. The religions of all peoples studied in the area fully corroborate Bidney's argument that it is often im- possible "to distinguish" among non-literate peoples "between the sphere of the nat- ural and that of the supernatural, since, gods and spirits are just as much a part of the order of nature as birds and animals."' Gods, spirits, and totems were regarded as real, if not always visible, part of the ordinary physical environment. [Lawrence 1964:12; cf. Counts and Counts 1976:299-300] Dorothy Counts gives examples of people asking her to point out heaven on a world map, to send back a picture from America of a deceased wife and to provide the address so others could write to her (Counts and Counts 1976:300-301). Here there is no conception of extraterritoriality, of a transcendental space over and above this world. Likewise, hell is also not conceived of as an outside space separate from the world. Censure's son declared that present bush Kaliai life is hell, that hell exists in toiling under a hot burning sun. The Church and the Bible are "talk picture" (that is, imaginative deceptive talk). I have said what is true. At the time when God and all worked the Bible they created the "talk picture" of God. This "talk picture" which they wrote says that if you are a being who steals, makes trouble, sorcery or kills another man when you die you will not go to God's place, you will not go to the place of happiness, you will go to the Devil's fire. However, they are only working a "picture" (that is, an image) in the Bible. Now the fire of inferno I exist in. I work hard clearing bush, when I work in the garden the sun burns me, this place is hot. For cargo cults the Church's hierarchizing of outside spaces (heaven and hell) relative to the present empirical world is a statement about present worldly colonial differences. Cultists give the theological spatial hierarchy an immanent form, and in doing so provide a spatial metaphor for the segmentary hierarchical structure of colonialism. This rendering immanent of the cartography of the Bible is also a feature of colonialism. The Bible's hierarchical structure of moral spaces is still used by</page><page sequence="22">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 251 colonial authorities as a moral language for rendering their own incursions as the civilizing process of an outside sacred power. Whites, missionaries, and the legal system situate themselves as the bearers of outside transcendental colonizing truths which will redeem the indigenous population. Their moral hegemony in the Kaliai area has grown through medicine and through their elimination of tradi- tional practices such as warfare and widow-killing ceremonies. In opposition to white outsiders, who live well and are seen not to work, those associated with the earth are positioned as living in ignorance, the very color of their skins marking the darkness they live in. My thought is that my skin is my bikhet. My bikhet gave me this skin, covered me up in blackness. Censure often screams at night with pain and mourning for an end to present ex- istence, for an end to that dark smoke which is said to have covered and stained the skins of his ancestors and created the binary logic of white and black races. Cargo cult followers often asked me if their skins would become white once the new age of equality and knowledge emerged (cf. Eves 1988:4; Williams 1976:343). Such statements are ways of embodying colonialism, personalizing its structures of domination. They reveal the profound self-alienation that colo- nialism produces as a condition of its hegemony. Colonialism is inscribed into the very tissues of the body insofar as people experience their bodies as part of their domination. These are all ways of instantiating that cartography of segmented spaces which colonial Christianity posits and proselytizes. The separation of sa- cred and profane spaces is internalized as the language of self-alienation. Colo- nialism is mapped onto the body to the point where the shedding of one's skin is cosubstantial with utopia.20 Notes Acknowledgments. In 1986 I carried out 12 months' fieldwork in the interior of the Kaliai Census Division. Villagers there differentiate themselves from those on the Kaliai coast by using the term Kaliai bush. During my fieldwork I worked with speakers of three language groups: the two Austronesian dialects of Mouk and Aria and to a lesser extent the Papuan language group of Anem. Despite some variations and differences, there is a shared corpus of origin myths and rituals between the three language groups in the villages where I worked. My fieldwork was made possible by the hospitality of the villages of Aikon, Bolo, Doko Sagra, Onamanga, Salke, Metavala, and Molour. In terms of my own culture, I would like to thank Tom Ernst, Richard Eves, Marilyn Strathern, Julie Marcus, and Ana Marko for their thoughtful comments. 'The term colonialism in this article includes also the postindependence context. Though indigenous people hold key positions in the present power structures of Papua New Guinea, those power structures are still seen by the bush Kaliai to be part of an intrusive white colonizing culture. 2Dorothy and David Counts have documented some of the extensive history of Kaliai cargo cults (Counts 1971, 1972; Counts and Counts 1976). The cargo cult movement expanded</page><page sequence="23">252 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY in the 1970s, with the government in 1971 and 1976 jailing the cult leader, Censure, and some of his followers. This did not eliminate the movement but drove it underground and fragmented its leadership. 3The terms waitskin (white-skin) and blakskin (black-skin) are used frequently throughout the bush Kaliai area. To the extent that I refer to whites and blacks it is precisely to incor- porate this racial coding of colonialism which organizes bodily differences as relationships of power. It is a binary coding whereby the terms function as proper names. 4There is a growing rejection of the promised utopia of development. Prior to my leaving the field the village of Salke split into two groups, with one group (that belonging to the moiety of "big bird') deserting their large coconut plantings and heading off to live further in the interior. Many villagers between 30 and 40 years of age, who received education under Australian colonial rule, now live in remote areas and avoid sending their children to school. Pointing to themselves, they say that nothing has come of their education. 'Consumption of white culture extends mainly to the wearing of clothing, cooking in alu- minum pots, and the use of steel knives and axes. 6The term hegemony is used by Gramsci to refer to a process of ideological domination, whereby those who are dominated come to reproduce aspects of the culture of those who rule them. They come to formulate their lives, their consciousness, and even their resis- tances by drawing upon the categories and language of their rulers (Gramsci 1971). 7"Poison" refers to women's power to pollute the food and water of men with vaginal secretions and menstrual blood. Throughout West New Britain this is distinguished from sorcery, which is regarded as a power belonging to men. 8Discussing cargo cults among the Elema of the Gulf Division of Papua, Richard Eves has argued that: "Under the dominant hegemonic discourse of colonialism, indigenous Papuan ways become impotent. Cargo cults codify and consolidate the desire to replace the lost fecundity with more productive means" (Eves 1988:5-6). 9There is no fixed dogma of cargo cult myths in the Kaliai area. There are many myths concerning the origins of whites and blacks, the inequalities between them, and the closure of those inequalities. Cargo cult beliefs do not interlock into a unified consistent logical totality. Indeed, they often contradict each other. They represent a mythopoeic praxis, whereby a culture explores and offers a multiplicity of reading positions. My work explores the limits and form of that mythopoeic praxis. It is concerned with the field, with the en- abling conditions, which structure the discursive sites from which it is possible to speak about colonial encapsulation. l?Chowning and Goodale (1965:267) have documented similar beliefs on the south side of West New Britain (among the Sengseng and Kaulong), where it is believed "that the copra produced on a local plantation (Ablingi) is shipped to a cave where a spirit, aided by the ghosts of the people's ancestors, turns it directly into European goods such as knives and money." l"I have translated all the quotes in this article from Melanesian pidgin. I have not tried to render them into "proper English" but have sought to maintain some feel for the nature of the discourse within which they were articulated. Often I have not identified who is speak- ing. This was partly to protect speakers, but also because the meanings and sentiments were often expressed by a number of people. I am more interested in contextualizing the struc- ture of the discourse rather than individualizing it.</page><page sequence="24">SEXUALITY AND CARGO CULTS 253 12I disagree with Bakhtin's view that "the epic past is locked into itself and walled off from all subsequent times by an impenetrable boundary, isolated from the eternal present of children and descendents" (Bakhtin 1981:17). The theoretical point to be made is that this is one positioning of mythic time, but as Sahlins has shown under certain historical cir- cumstances mythic time is capable of being positioned as repeatable in the present. The killing of Captain Cook replays out the mythic drama of the sacrificing of the Hawaiian god Lono (Sahlins 1981, 1987:73-75). We must grasp the positioning of mythic time as part of the politics of the historical engagement of present actors with the powers of mythic time. '3Discussing Gramsci's concept of hegemony, Keesing points out that often those who are dominated internalise the premises and categories of the dominant. In part, it is because the discourse of domination creates the objective, institutional realities within which struggles must be fought; and because it defines the semiology through which claims to power must be expressed. I will suggest that the Manichaean conceptual structure of missionary dis- course-dualities of Christian light and heathen darkness, God and the Devil, good and evil- have a continuing impress on Pacific thought, even in countercolonial discourse. [Keesing n.d. :7] '4For some cargo cult followers the totem of the moiety of bikpela pisin, namely Bogi or sea eagle, is a symbol belonging to Papua New Guinea, a symbol whose magical powers and properties whites usurp. The son of Censure had this to say on the matter: "The hand of Bogi holds all kinds of things. His hand holds mani kina. However, we have not got one head (that is, a unified, collective, and agreed upon existence). If we had one head then the law would be out by now. 'Bogi holds everything' has this meaning: everything is a picture of Bogi. Bogi lies on all unforms, on mani kina, on everything. When we go to picture talk everyone turns it to Papua New Guinea, but Bogi only holds everything." 'In a recent bush Kaliai cult begun by a woman, she would stand her followers up and then mime with her hands photographing them. She claimed that from this cargo would arrive. '6Throughout Melanesia ex-state officials have figured prominently in cargo cults (Bur- ridge 1960:137; Counts and Counts 1976:292-293; Worsley 1957:79, 90, 224, 225). In the Kaliai area, Aikele's cargo cult influence was partly due to him being an ex-police sergeant. He claimed (falsely) that three kiaps at Talasea were in his pay (that is, being bribed). Aikele also collected his own taxes, using this as a criterion for people entering his cult and for them receiving the promise of a share of the coming cargo. His threat to the colonial state lay in his appropriating its political powers. '7Incest can be important in the symbolic codification of power. The ability to break the rules, to stand outside them, is also the process of standing over and above those who live and are incorporated into the rules. Censure's incestuous union with his mother is part of the construction of him as powerful, it authorizes his discourse. It should be noted that Censure's sister belongs to the same moiety as Censure's mother. Sexual intercourse with his sister continues to be sexual intercourse with the maternal component of his existence, with the blood that formed him. A man marrying a woman of the same moiety as himself is said to be marrying his own mother. "8Throughout Melanesia and Australia the image of being swallowed and disgorged by a supernatural being is a widespread motif in initiation rituals. It is a metaphor for thinking about and for realizing a symbolic transformation of the self (cf. Dundes 1976:224-225; Eliade 1958:35-37, 1960:218-223; Hage 1981; Hiatt 1971, 1975).</page><page sequence="25">254 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY "9I owe this way of formulating the argument to Lester Hiatt. 20To the extent that anthropologists have discovered snakes to be important mythological figures, we need to ask ourselves whether they have been empowered as such by colonial- ism, whether they are in fact not also metaphors of colonial redemption, that is, images for going beyond the darkness of one's personhood, for shedding the sin of one's culture and personhood.
