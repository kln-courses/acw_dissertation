<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS thought-provoking synopsis of the material, this book will receive heavy usage from students and teachers alike. The format is traditional. After a brief introduction come chapters on architectural sculpture; reliefs; person- alities (spotlighting Lysippos); and other genres. Though the period is more tidily defined by R.'s own output than art-historically (her Fifth-Century Styles stopped at 400 and her Hellenistic Sculpture I begins in 330), her discussion is full and well documented, and pays explicit and welcome attention to stylistic pluralism and to the periphery. Only portraits and athletes are somewhat shortchanged. When we part company, it is mostly over details and argumentation. In particular, an (entirely laudable) desire to present all sides of the case and a lecturer's habit of throwing in 'random observations' sometimes make her text resemble an extended footnote. Strings of disjunc- tive particles create a seesawing effect that tends to leave the reader somewhat queasy. Specialists will welcome her openness, resistance to easy and/or conven- tional answers, and zest for controversy, but students tell me they often find her arguments hard to follow. Grouping pros and cons together would help. In one area-personalities (Chs. 7-8)-our differences are more serious. What did the great fourth-century masters-not merely sculptors-really achieve? To R., this 'period ... stressed continuity over originality' (265). To the Hellenistic and Roman critics, and to me, it did the opposite. Its practitioners-sculptors, painters, and architects-some brilliantly original, took their high classic heritage in an amazing variety of directions. (One Italian colleague compares our clash on this issue with the 'cold' fourth-century economy envisioned by Polanyi and Finley and the 'hot' one favoured by many contemporary historians.) To support her case, R. cites a supposedly universal 'ancient belief that tradition is to be preferred over originality', but warns against 'fabricating just such a sequence because it appears logical to us' (19, her italics). Yet regarding the Great Masters she seems to do just this, resurrecting a fin-de-siecle version of her mentor Rhys Carpenter's 'art without artists' by sternly exiling the heterodox to the Hellenistic period or to Rome. Sometimes her prosecutorial zeal turns into special pleading: one strike and it's out. All this suggests, first, that R. has yet to escape fully from Carpenter's shadow; and second, that like him she instinctively still prefers what the Parisian art historian and critic Georges Didi-Huberman has aptly called euchrony, a smooth, untroubled landscape that denies what he terms 'anachronism', the sheer jagged messiness of history (Artforum, Jan. 1995, 64-5). Unfortunately, this kind of historical idealism just creates bigger potholes down the road. For if these later periods were so inventive and their products so popular in copy, why did the ancient critics uniformly judge them bankrupt and third-rate? R.'s Praxiteles is a case in point. 'Suspecting' that the Pouring Satyr is Hellenistic or Roman because of its thoroughgoing and revolutionary anthropomorphism (266), she ventures that the numerous fourth-century Athenian banquet reliefs where the type does duty as a winepourer provided the inspiration for it. This at once cruelly orphans these multiple siblings, reverses the normal logic of art-historical causality, and so impover- ishes the Satyr's supposed latter-day creator that he must pilfer the fourth century's least significant sculptural genre for inspiration. If the Satyr returns to the Praxitelean fold, what of the rest? What of the Sauroktonos, whose 'effeminate appearance, slender forms, and peculiar activity, ... more in common with later concepts and renderings' leave R. 'uneasy' (265); and the Arles Aphrodite, which she reassigned to the second century over twenty years ago? (Yet the latter is echoed on a Kerch-style hydria in Athens, NM 12592, and a poros statuette from an Agora deposit of c. 350, S 965.) As to the Knidia, R. likes the theory of another pupil of Carpenter's, Christine Havelock, that she was far from being immediately inaugurative-one of Walter Benjamin's famous 'eddies in the stream of becoming' (The Origins of German Tragic Drama (1928/1963; Eng. tr. by G. Steiner (1977) 45). Instead, she stood forgotten for two hundred years before her sudden 'rediscovery' in (surprise!) the later second century. But Havelock's contention rests on a shaky combination of negative evidence (no surviving Hellenistic texts and no precisely dated Hellenistic versions either) and special pleading (the piece-by-piece down-dating of what we do have), and discounts Pliny's clear implication that the Knidia's fame was instantaneous (N.H. 36.20-22: illo enim signo Praxiteles nobilitavit Cnidum, etc.). This piecemeal assault on the evidence is murder by inches-a sort of archaeological Death By A Thousand Cuts. And now the Knidia stands bereft and alone in the fourth century, no doubt some overzealous camp-follow- er will soon banish her too to the second, where one or two remote scions of the Praxiteles clan still kept the family trade just barely alive: 'Knidia eines Praxiteles?' Yet I cannot end on a negative note. Reviewing an earlier book of R.'s in the same series fifteen years ago, I wrote that, 'Our common house has many mansions, and on her own territory Ridgway's pre-eminence is self-evident. Her enthusiasm kindles ours, her perceptiveness sharpens our own; she helps us all to see Greek sculpture with fresh eyes, and one can hardly ask for more' (Art Bulletin 65 (1983) 175). Nothing has changed. ANDREW STEWART University of California at Berkeley KAMPEN (N.) Ed. Sexuality in Ancient Art: Near East, Egypt, Greece, and Italy. Cambridge UP, 1996. Pp. xviii + 299. ?45.00 (?15.95 pb.). 0521470- 994 (0521476836 pb.). From the beginning, it is clear that Kampen has produced an important book which breaks much new ground, and will be a standard work for some time. Her collection of seventeen specially commissioned essays is coherent and clear, and remarkably free of the 'curate's egg' factor which bedevils so many edited books. The contributors talk to each other while discussing very different kinds of evidence: several of their papers cover in one way or another the disjunction between the plastic arts and social life, for instance. Hence Robin Osborne ('Desiring Women on Athenian Pottery', 65-80) 228</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS examines why Greek pot painters 'explore sexual relations between men or between men and women in ways that appear not to adhere to the conventions we have good reason to think applied in life' (65), and Andrew Stewart considers why there are images of mythological women apparently taking the sexual initiative on Greek mirror covers ('Reflections', 136-15- 4). With such internal coherence, the book has almost none of the usual weak links. The essays are theoretical- ly informed, but do not lapse into incomprehensible jargon or polemical tub-thumping. Theoretical insights are deployed thoughtfully, to shed light on the material under discussion, rather than gratuitously to show off the writer's sophistication. From this angle, I particularly enjoyed Page duBois' psychoanalytic reading of moder responses to ancient fragments, be they scraps of Greek lyric or artefacts ('Archaic Bodies-in-Pieces', 55-64). While accommodating theory, the book also has a pleasing emphasis on Sitz im Leben. Almost all the contributors consider specific ancient artistic products as objects functioning in living environments, with mean- ings bestowed on them by their place in that culture and by the reactions of individuals to them. A good example is Bettina Bergmann's essay on the location of wall-paint- ings of heroines from Greek tragedy in one room in the House of Jason at Pompeii ('The Pregnant Moment: Tragic Wives in the Roman Interior', 199-218). She focuses on questions of intent and response in the creation and consumption of these images of Medea, Phaedra, and Helen, concluding that '[t]he Pompeian relaxing in this small secluded red-and-black room ... felt elevated by knowing the Greek stories and titillated by the delightful illusion that women really will kill and die for love' (215). The essays K. has selected are wide-ranging in terms of their chronological and geographical focus, their theoretical alignments, and also in the ways they define what might constitute 'sexuality' in a given ancient culture. The breadth and plurality of the contributions is one of the high points of the book, and shows how far we have come from the days (not so long ago in classi- cal studies) when sexuality was entirely defined by sexual acts, usually those involving penetration. For me, this aspect of the book was subtly and intelligently implied by its cover image, a detail from the magnifi- cent Herculaneum fresco of Medea, her face harrowed as she contemplates killing her children. What a change from the cliched pictures usually employed as cover art for ancient sex books: I have lost count of the number of times the Roman mirror case with the scene of lovers in bed, now in the Capitoline Museum, has been used. We are moving from the world of ancient 'organ-grind- ing' (to steal Stephen Marcus' phrase, describing Victor- ian pornographic literature), to a world of emotions and personal histories in which monolithic constructions of sexuality have no place. Of the seventeen essays, three concern the ancient Near and Middle East (Egypt and Mesopotamia) in pre- classical times, six concern different periods of Greek art, and seven are on Roman art (all imperial apart from one on the Etruscans). The book concludes with an interesting piece on the Nachleben of classical art (W. Davis, 'Winckelmann's "Homosexual" Teleologies', 262-76). Even the more traditionally classical case- studies introduce artworks which will be unfamiliar to many readers, such as K.'s own essay on representations of the Omphale myth ('Omphale and the Instability of Gender', 233-46), or John Clarke's piece about the images of ithyphallic black men on mosaic floors in Roman baths ('Hypersexual Black Men in Augustan Baths: Ideal Somatotypes and Apotropaic Magic', 184-98; now considered further in his book Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art, U California P, 1998). I for one was pleased to see that K. included a few pieces on artistic traditions lying outside the conven- tional parameters of ancient art. Her inclusion of this material shows up the narrowness of the sources usually invoked. However, to me the three chapters on the ancient Near and Middle East had a rather perfunctory feel, though I would not go so far as to say their pres- ence is tokenistic. Perhaps because their data sets are so much earlier and so iconographically different from Greek and Roman art, these contributions seemed to exist more in vacuo than the others, without speaking to the other papers in the way that (e.g.) Osborne's and Stewart's essays do. Here I think that K. may have fallen (unwittingly?) into the trap of privileging the earlier works of art from Egypt and Mesopotamia over those produced when these areas became Hellenised or provinces of the Roman empire. Her book's internal cohesion would have been tighter had she included a couple of essays on (say) sexuality in Romano-Egyptian coroplastics or funerary busts from Roman Palmyra, instead of those on the Bronze Age or early Iron Age evidence. In some senses, one could argue that K.'s selection of material ultimately perpetuates the elevation of the high arts of certain times and places as the ancient art historical canon. Thus there are some obvious gaps. Why is there nothing on Roman provincial art, and why nothing on late antiquity? We go directly from the Second Sophistic to Winckelmann. But this is really a small criticism of what is an important and exciting book. In many ways, K. has produced the paradigmatic edited collection, not only because of the quality of the contributors and her scrupulous editing, but also because of the book's high production values.

This book is quite remarkable in sustaining the reader's interest in a single work of art, albeit an outstanding one, for over 200 pages. The introduction provides a detailed description of the Alexander Mosaic and raises some methodological issues which have beset previous studies of the piece-the search for 'the ancient viewer', the temptation to deal with such a successfully illusionistic image as if it were a real battle, the relation- ship between art and text. Ch. 2 relates the Mosaic to representations of battles in fifth- and fourth-century Greek art, including the Alexander Sarcophagus, as well as Roman military scenes. Ch. 3 deals with the import- ant 'question of the copy', testing the scholarly assump- tion that the Mosaic, and related images, are, all derived 229</page></plain_text>
