<plain_text><page sequence="1">Masaccio's Fresco in Santa Maria Novella: a Symbolic Representation of the Eucharistie Sacrifice Joanne Snow-Smith The so-called Trinity (fig. 1) which was paint- ed by Masaccio about 1427 in the Church of San- ta María Novella in Florence has generally been regarded as a seminal Renaissance painting principally because of the accurate system of mathematical perspective employed. The skillful spatial rendering of the Brunelleschian architec- tural scheme successfully opens up the flat wall surface to portray a trompe l'oeil aedicula in which the main protagonists, God the Father, the Dove of the Holy Spirit and the Crucified Christ flanked by the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist, act out their essential rôles in the Sa- lus Mundi, much as in a mystery play, behind an imaginary proscenium arch before which there appear, as it were, in the spectator's space, two kneeling donors above a memento mori1. That Masaccio's revolutionary painting breaks with Mediaeval traditions of style and technique and heralds a new era is today universally accepted 2. However, an aspect of the painting which is not generally considered is that Masaccio has also applied fundamental Renaissance characteristics in the portrayal of a Mediaeval iconographie rep- resentation later designated either as a Gnaden- stuhl, a term first used by Martin Luther in his translation of Exodus 25, 17-22 to describe the cover of the Ark of the Covenant, and used again in Hebrews 4, 16; 9, 5, and Romans 3, 22-25, or as a «Throne of Grace», a term derived from William Tyndale's almost concurrent English translation of «mercy seat» 3. Although the word Gnadenstuhl is to be found on a sixteenth-century engraving of a rep- resentation of the iconographie schema of God the Father holding His Crucified Son with both Persons united through the appearance of the Dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit, the term or its English equivalent did not join the art historian's lexicon until the nineteenth-century4. In Leviticus 16, 14, reference is made to the «mercy seat» which was placed on the Ark of the Covenant and sprinkled with the blood of a bul- lock on the Day of Atonement. In the Epistle to the Hebrews this ceremony was seen as a typological reference to the Cross of Christ as an efficacious remission of sin. In Hebrews 4, 16, the author writes: «Let us be confident, then, in approaching the throne of grace, that we shall have mercy from Him and grace when we are in need of help»5. Thus, the reader is invited to approach Christ as a sympathetic advocate under the epith- et of «Throne of Grace», in terms inspired by Isai- ah 16, 5 which speaks of the solium misericordiae: the throne of mercy of the righteous judge. It is therefore proposed that Masaccio's painting should be understood principally not as a representation of the Trinity qua Trinity but rather as a manifestation, or better, a celebration, of the Mystery of the Eucharist, and that it is a di- dactic image proclaiming the sin-cleansing and redemptive powers of the Sacrifice of Christ eter- nally re-enacted in the Eucharist which an- nounces the triumph of the New Covenant over the Old and, concomittantly, that of Eternal Life over Death earned by that Sacrifice. The proposition will be presented that the Eucharistie interpretation of the Throne of Grace image is deeply rooted in its first tentative mani- festation to be found in manuscript illuminations comprising the decoration of the Tau of the Te igi- tur prayer at the beginning of the Canon of the Mass in which the Clementissime Pater is asked to accept the gifts, offerings and oblations at the Eu- charist6. In the decorated initial Tau of the Te igitur in the Sacramentary of Bishop Drogo of Metz7, of about 830, interwoven within the entwined gold- en foliage, appear four fields with figures which refer to the Old Testament sacrifices prefiguring the Sacrifice of Christ. In the center, Melchizedek, priest-king of Salem, stands in front of an altar on which appear bread and a chalice symbolic of the Eucharist as he looks upward to the hand of God appearing on the clouds in acceptance of the sac- rifice. Both on the left Abel, offering the lamb, and on the right Abraham, holding a ram, likewise look upward at the accepting hand. Abraham 47</page><page sequence="2">points downward toward the two bullocks at the base of the Tau to augment the enumeration of Old Testament sacrificial beasts acceptable to God. About fifty years later in a Sacramentary Fragment of the Court School of Charles the Bald (fol. 6v)8, Christ takes His place within the initial Tau of the Te igitur replacing the earlier sacrificial images evoked by the earlier Old Testament préfi- gurations. Here the living Christ stands trium- phant over death as the blood from the wounds of His feet pours over and vanquishes Satan in the form of a serpent. Within the developmental scheme of the Throne of Grace imagery also falls the verso of the Cross of Lothar, of about 980, which portrays the Crucified Christ and incorporates, according to Gertrud Schiller, in this imagery for the first time the Dove which appears here in the center of a wreath9. This classical symbol of victory, sur- mounting the dead Christ, manifests His sacrifi- cial victory over death, while the acceptance of His sacrifice in behalf of all humankind is ac- knowledged by the dextra Domini proffering the wreath. During the twelfth century, the symbol of the hand of God with the victorious wreath en- circling the Dove was replaced by a half-length image of God the Father with the Dove of the Ho- ly Spirit between Him and the Crucified Christ, as portrayed in the altartop on the Portable Altar from Hildesheim, dated before 1332, which ap- pears to mark the transformation of the Crucified image into that of the immediate forerunner of the Throne of Grace portrayal10. Here, God the Father appears en buste above the Crucified Christ and grasps His arms as if to support Him on the Cross. The Dove of the Holy Spirit appears to issue from the mouth of the Father and des- cend upon the head of His Son. An arc, symboliz- ing the boundary of Heaven, separates the celes- tial and eternal world of God and the Risen Christ from the earthly and temporal world in which He died. The earliest surviving example of a fully- developed image of the Throne of Grace is to be found in a miniature decorating the Te igitur pray- er in the missal now in Cambrai, of about 112011, wherein the full figure of the enthroned Father is now asked to accept the sacrifice re-enacted in the Eucharist. In a similar illumination of about fifty years later, found in a manuscript from Western Ger- many or Belgium, the Throne of Grace decorates the Tau of the Te igitur prayer on which the dead Christ is portrayed crucified 12 . Directly below the Cross, a large chalice collects the blood flowing from the feet of Christ, thus underscoring the Eu- charistie significance of the image. It is, however, a portrayal on a paten (fig. 2), made and signed by Brother hugo d'Oignies for the convent of Notre-Dame in Namur in 1228, that makes explicit the Celebration of the Euchar- ist13. The paten, on which the bread will be con- secrated and from which it will be given in the Communion, bears the Throne of Grace image of the «holy and unblemished sacrifice» which will be offered to the Father. In representations of the Throne of Grace the Three Persons of the Trinity are present but not, it should be emphasized, with the purpose of portraying a Trinitarian image qua Trinity, but rather with an intent to portray the fact that the Eucharistie imagery has come to involve all Three Persons of the Trinity. However, it should be mentioned that the Throne of Grace image need not always involve the Dove of the Holy Spirit unless it is desired to manifest the epikletic rôle of the Sande Spiritus. Several examples of the omission of the Dove may be cited14. The best known is from the so- called «Anagogical Window» of Abbot Suger in Saint-Denis, of about 1135, in which the Ark of the Convenant is borne on the symbolic quadriga of Aminadab surmounted by the Cross of the Cru- cified Christ held by God the Father beneath which the inscription reads in translation: «On the Ark of the Covenant is established the al- tar with the Cross of Christ; Here Life wishes to die under a greater cove- nant» 1S. Perhaps the meaning of the rôle played by the Dove of the Holy Spirit will serve to clarify the inclusion of the Third Person of the Trinity in the complete Throne of Grace representation. As we have seen, most of the examples discussed above have been intimately related to the Mass, either by way of altartops or missals and most notably as decorations of the Te igitur prayer. As Josef Jungmann explains, basically in the forma- tion of the old Roman liturgy, the epiklesis was in- troduced in the Te igitur prayer 16. The Holy Spirit was regarded as a mediator between Heaven and earth so that the SANCTE SPIRITUS was specially in- voked in order that the gifts of bread and wine may become the body and blood of Christ in the miracle of the Mass17. In some cases during the celebration, a dove-shaped tabernacle containing the church's supply of consecrated Hosts was able to be lowered over the altar during the ceremony by means of a pulley 18, a suggestion of which may be seen in the illumination of the Celebration of 48</page><page sequence="3">1.

Thus the inclusion of the Dove of the Holy Spirit in the Throne of Grace image served a specific purpose other than that of merely as a represen- tation of the Third Person of the Trinity, for as Jungmann states, the epiklesis was a legitimate element of the Eucharistie Prayer19. The schema of the Throne of Grace became frequent by the end of the twelfth-century where- in God the Father was portrayed with features identical to those of His Son in compliance with the early Mediaeval theological belief that God the Father could be represented only through the appearance of His Son in accordance with Christ's words: «He who has seen me has seen the Father» ( John 14, 9). In the Soest Retable of around 1250, now in Berlin (fig. 4), God the Father is no longer the du- plicate of the Son. To the Soest Master, God ap- pears as the awesome diety of the Old Covenant. As Hubert Schrade states: «The painter of Soest is, as much as we can tell, the first one who, through the sharp distinction of Father and Son, represents the sacrifice of the Son demanded by the Father as the awesome sacrament that it is. Evidently he decided to do that through the Abraham-type as his representa- tion in general appears as a counter-part to the lap of Abraham»20. In Genesis 12, 5, God made a covenant with Abraham promising that he and his descendants would have a great historical destiny. It was this affirmation of the Old Testament that the only true God was the God of Abraham that later made the pictorial image of Abraham an accept- able and appropriate configuration for God the Father as the Ancient of Days (Daniel 7, 9). In the image of the Throne of Grace, God the Father holds the body of His Sacrificed Son on the Cross, a sacrifice, however, that God did not ultimately demand of Abraham. It is this Abraham-type of God the Father that we find in the representation of the Throne of Grace in Masacció's fresco. In lieu of the splen- did throne upon which He sits in the Soest Ret- able, God the Father has been placed by Masaccio standing21 within an aedicula reminiscent of a baldachinum that often was erected above the high altar to shield the Corpus Christi (fig. 5). To better comprehend both the innovative scope of Masaccio's contribution and, at the same time, his indebtedness to the earlier Mediaeval schema of the Throne of Grace, one must draw a comparison between his painting and a recently discovered contemporaneous fresco of the same theme which decorates the apse-bowl of an eleventh century former Benedictine chapel which is situated in the open countryside outside the village of Scarnafigi in the Province of Cuneo near Saluzzo, known today as La cappella della Santissima Trinità, shown before restoration in fi- gure 6 and after restoration in the early 1970's in figure 7 22. This chapel was mentioned in the day-by- day diary of Pasquier Le Moyne, portier ordinaire to François Ier, who accompanied the French ar- my on the young king's first campaign into Pied- mont and Lombardy in 1515 23. His entry for the eighteenth day of August describes the chapel as «a very wonderful place in which there are to be seen both inside and out remarkable sights»24. While the extant interior frescoes, which will be discussed below, amply bear out Pasquieťs words of praise, the only exterior fresco remaining is a tondo of Saint Peter above the entrance door. It is certainly possible that this fresco provided the central focus of a larger programme but, inas- much as now none of the originad plaster re- mains, whatever decorations that might have aug- mented it and were evident to Pasquier are now lost to us. Because óf the collapse of the barrel-vaulted roof which necessitated the restoration of the chapel in 1971, the majority of the interior fres- coes were badly damaged and only those frescoes within the apse (fig. 8) were partially protected by the triumphal arch which itself remained stand- ing, The single register of rectangular scenes, which are arranged along the lateral walls, has not fared as well. The frescoes on the right hand side, perhaps because of the prevailing winds, are better preserved than those on the opposite wall which, unfortunately, are damaged almost to the point of illegibility. The only extant information concerning the commissioning of these frescoes is to be found in a banderole in the, upper area of the first fresco on the right lateral wall adjacent to the triumphal arch. Unfortunately, a restorative mason has covered over the end letters or words on the ban- derole with cement and thus all that can be seen now are the words: «HOC OPUS FECIT FIERI FRATER ANTONIUS DE VIG...». Despite the lack of any date in this inscrip- tion, a terminus post quem of 1440 and ante quem of 1416 for the apse frescoes seems likely for rea- sons set forth below, and a date of around 1430 is suggested.

This identification is supported by comparison of the Scarnafigi kneeling figure with a known portrayal of Amadeus, attributed to Jean Bapteur, dated about 1430, in a miniature em- ployed as the frontispiece of a French translation of Albertano da Brescia's De Doctrina dicendi et tacendi which is now in the Bibliothèque Royale in Brussels (fig. 10). This identification is further strengthened by another portrayal of him attributed to the same artist (fig. 11). Here, Amadeus is shown as a pal- mer standing to the right of the foot of the cross in the Crucifixion panel in the Museo Civico in Tu- rin. Amadeus VIII was born in 1383 at Cham- béry, became Count of Savoy at the age of eight, and, in 1416 when he was 33, the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund bestowed upon him the title of Duke25. In 1434, becoming disillusioned with the world, he turned over the administration of his Duchy to his son, Ludovico, and retired to Ri- paille where, two years later, he founded the secu- lar monastery of St. Maurice 26 . In 1439, during a dispute of the Bishops at the Council of Basle, Amadeus was elected Pope, a position which he held as anti-pope under the name of Felix V, until he resigned in 1449 under pressure from the ruling houses of Europe27. On January 4, 1451, he died at Geneva but was buri- ed in Ripaille. Based upon these known facts of his life, the fresco portrait at Scarnafigi portraying a man in ducal garb, if this identification of it as a portrait of Amadeus VIII is correct, by necessity must be dated after 1416, wheň Amadeus VIII attained to the Dukedom and before he resigned the office on 6 January 144028. This supposition does, indeed, coincide with the approximate dating of 1430 for the manuscript illumination by Jean Bapteur. Sheila Edmunds notes in her study on the manu- scripts of Amadeus that he «was handsomely bearded ca. 1430»29. All three bearded likenesses must, of course, be dated by necessity, before Ama- deus VIII assumed the Papacy in 1440 as it is re- corded that he shaved his beard at this time and is thus portrayed in an assumed portrait of him in the Royal Missal of Felix V30. It is suggested that the execution of the apse-bowl fresco decorations at Scarnafigi (fig. 8) was financed by funds provided by Amadeus VIII who in turn was honored as the donor by being portrayed as being present at the Entombment Shortly after the death of his wife in 1428 during the plague in Turin, it is known that Amadeus VIII turned strongly to religion for consolation; he began to enforce clerical reforms, was active in suppressing heresies and founded several monas- teries31. Perhaps this small chapel at Scarnafigi and the no longer extant convent connected with it, situated in one of the apanage States that he had inherited in 1418, had a special meaning for Amadeus VIII. The iconographical programme of the fres- coes that are still legible in this chapel appears to have been planned after the Liturgy of the Mass, and the paintings themselves seem to have been executed in the format used in illuminated mis- sals32. This latter observation is supported espe- cially by the inclusion of the Introit to the Mass of the Feast of the Holy Trinity beneath a fresco, to be discussed below, depicting the Trinity in the guise of three identical men which, although par- tially obscured, is readily identifiable. It is proposed that the innovative iconogra- phie concetto of this fresco cycle was conceived by Amadeus VIII who was the owner of one of the most illustrious libraries in Europe at that time and that he based not only the programme on manuscripts that he possessed, but also instructed that the individual frescoes should be reproduced in the artistic vocabulary of the miniaturist. The schema of the apse frescoes together with those in the triumphal arch, as well as the Trinity fresco, just mentioned, on the left lateral wall, appear to have been planned as a pictorial representation of the Credo, beginning with the Incarnation in the Annunciation on the triumphal arch. In the left spandrel, the Archangel Gabriel kneels and holds the Annunciatory message on a banderole, while in the opposite spandrel, the requisite answer of the Virgin appears on an- other. At the apex of the arch while there remains only a small section of a rainbow aureole and part of a banderole, however enough remains to ascertain that the entire banderole would have once read in translation: «This is my Son in whom I am well pleased», and to conclude that the rainbow aureole once contained a portrayal of God the Father en buste. This interpretation is borne out by the appearance of the lower torso and legs of a small child in a red aureole immedi- ately to the right of the banderole. This can be taken as a visual representation of the Incarna- tion of Christ at the instant of the Annunciation and would represent the object of God the Fa- ther's statement. 52</page><page sequence="7">This particular iconographie motif of the In- carnation in which God the Father sends out His Son as a small Child with hands folded in prayer, descending to the Virgin in the image of the An- nunciation was popular in the fourteenth and fif- teenth centuries33. It should be noted, however, despite the widespread use of this iconographie image, that it was not accepted by all theologians, many of whom feared that this presentation of the Child descending might give rise to the heresy that Jesus was divine in nature as well as in es- sence and thus did not partake of the human na- ture of His mother34. Because of the extreme rarity of the choice of the subject matter of the Throne of Grace for the central position in the apse-bowl, this chapel becomes significant for our study (fig. 13). While the sacramental image of the Throne of Grace was eminently suitable as an apse-bowl fresco de- coration, directly over the altar, such was not the case. The only two instances of its use known to the author are the one at Scarnafigi and another to be found in the apse of the right-hand nave in the Church of Santa Maria del Monastero at Man- ta, which contains stylistic characteristics indicat- ing that the representation was borrowed from Scarnafigi35. The inclusion of the previously mentioned fresco on the left lateral wall of a rep- resentation of the Trinity (fig. 14) supports the proposition that the Throne of Grace fresco in the apse-bowl was originally not intended nor consid- ered to be a representation of the Trinity, but rather that of the Celebration of the Eucharist, in- asmuch as two Trinitarian representations in the same small area would have been inappropriately repetitious. In the lateral wall representation of the Trin- ity, (fig. 14) three identical young men are portray- ed seated on a Synthronos, each blessing with the right hand, while holding a closed book in the other, and clad in flowing vestments that con- verge in the center giving the impression that three upper torsos are emerging from only one lower body36. This impression is supported by the fact that only two bare feet can be seen under the drapery on the foot rest. The figures are encircled by a partial aureole, a device utilized, in addition to its symbolic meaning, to more closely bind the bodies together. As previously mentioned, ben- eath this portrayal of the Trinity, although only fragments of words remain, there is enough to identify them as the Introit to the Mass of the Feast of the Holy Trinity. This type of iconographical programme of three identical figures, particularly those joined together with one lower body, became the subject of theological objections and later came under at- tack because of the threat that it posed to the Trinitarian concept, and gradually fell out of fa- vor until it was anathematized at the time of the Council of Trent37. In regard to the Eucharistie symbolism in- herent in the Throne of Grace image, it is of inter- est to compare Masaccio's representation with that by the Scarnafigi Master (figs. 1 and 13). The latter has placed God the Father on a rainbow emblematic of the one that appeared after the Flood, a symbol of union, pardon and reconcilia- tion given to humanity by God ( Genesis 9, 8-17) and has surrounded Him with the Apocalyptic rainbow described in Revelations 4, 2-3: «Behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne... and there was a rainbow round about the throne». It should be noted that in the Scarnafigi fresco, the relative size of the figures in the image of the Throne of Grace is in the Mediaeval sym- bolic tradition. It is not intended to be hierarchi- cal, proclaiming the greater importance of God the Father than His Son, nor is this representa- tion meant to portray realistically a one-time his- torical event. Rather, it is intended as a liturgical statement setting forth visually the sacramental happening which daily is renewed on the altar during the Mass in which the Body and Blood of the Crucified Christ become manifest in the Eu- charist38. In fact, it is the very difference in the scale of the two Divine Figures that proclaims that we are looking at a portrayal of God as God the Father, but at the Crucified Christ, not as Himself physically but as a symbol of the redemp- tive powers of the Eucharist. Perhaps we can say that the Throne of Grace representation is a glori- fied monstrance in which the Eucharistie God ra- diates His divinity within the enclosing arms of the Father. It is Saint John the Baptist, in the Resurrec- tion scene to the right of the Throne of Grace at Scarnafigi, who explicates overtly the Eucharistie message (fig. 15). It should not be perceived that the Baptist has chosen to ignore the Risen Christ as Vexillifer, for it is this very Christ Who has shat- tered the gates of Hell and led forth the Precursor and the others deemed worthy during the Anasta- sis. It is rather that the Harbinger wishes to call attention to Christ's redemptive rôle not only for the elect of the Harrowing of Hell, but more im- portantly, for His rôle in the redemption of all hu- mankind, as the Baptist points and calls our at- tention to the central apse figures and proclaims, via a banderole: «Ecce Agnus Dei, qui tollis pecca- ta mundi», and thus makes explicit the Eucharis- 53</page><page sequence="8">54</page><page sequence="9">9 14 15 10 12 11 13 9.

In this light, we can look at Masaccio's so- called Trinity in Santa Maria Novella and recog- nize the full explication of its Eucharistie mes- sage. However, Masaccio, while still working with- in the traditional Mediaeval iconographie schema of the Throne of Grace image, has, unlike the Scarnafigi Master, emphatically proclaimed the humanity - not just the symbolism - of the Cru- cified Christ by depicting His body in the natural- istic scale of the Renaissance idiom. In addition, the artist has chosen to include the traditional terrestrial witnesses to the Crucifixion scene: Mary, the Mater Dolorosa, who is filled with inex- haustible sorrow, and Saint John the Evangelist, the Apostle whom Christ loved39. In Masaccio's painting, the concept of Christ as a manifestation of the New Covenant is aug- mented by the figure of Mary looking outward at the viewer as if to invite him to approach her Son, the «Throne of Grace», through her as an intercessor in her rôle as the Ark of the New Covenant in which the Word had become Flesh40. It is suggested that the Virgin, not only qua the grieving Mother of God but also qua Mater Eccle- sia 41, has replaced the Scarnafigi representation of Saint John the Baptist and is herself proclaim- ing the Sacrifice of her Son to the faithful: «Be- hold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sins of the world». The new Renaissance appreciation of the no- bility and dignity of humankind and the rôle of the Christiani populi fides , communis Ecclesiae fides within Salvation history is evidenced here in the no longer hierarchical but rather life-sized and naturalisticálly proportioned figures of two don- ors who are depicted devoutly kneeling within the viewer's space, even though they appear outside the sacred shrine of the Throne of Grace itself42. The originality of Masaccio's innovative in- clusion of a memento mori placed beneath the main pictorial area between four Ionic columns, has been the center of much scholarly discussion since its rediscovery in 195243. In this regard, it is proposed that the artist was continuing to utilize Mediaeval traditional iconographie symbolism but that he stated it in the modern lexicon of the Renaissance. As Charles de Tolnay points out, Ma- saccio's representation is the earliest known de- piction of a human skeleton that is anatomically correct, anticipating by fifty years the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci44. In Crucifixion scenes from the ninth century onwards, the head of Adam45 or his entombed body46 was often represented directly beneath the symbolic Rock of Golgotha above which Christ hung on the Cross while the blood from His wounds flowed downward bathing Adam in the Baptism of Eternal Life47. Later it was sometimes Adam's skeleton48 that was depicted or often his skull or the figure of Adam himself actively aris- ing from his grave49. In all of these representa- tions, Christ's victory over physical death by His atoning death and Resurrection as «the firstborn from the dead», is proclaimed to the faithful. As Saint Paul wrote: «For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive» (I Cor. 15, 22). These depictions of Adam later came to signify «Everyman» in the sense of all humanity who had been and would be redeemed by the Blood of Christ. The universality of death is made explicit in Masaccio's fresco by the inclusion, above the skeleton, of the Italian inscription which reads in translation: «I was once that which you are, and what I am you also will be», based on the Trecen- to Triumph of Death legend of the Meeting of the Three Living and the Three Dead50. Masaccio, while rejecting the Mediaeval specific symbolic repre- sentation of Adam beneath the Cross51, has, nevertheless, fully retained the Adamic meaning in the negation of the power of mortal death, in a direct and intimate appeal to the viewer within a personal frame of reference, by the placement of the memento mori beneath the Throne of Grace, and underscores Saint Paul's words: «Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?». (I Cor. 15, 54-55) Viewed in toto, Masaccio's fresco is a compo- sition of heroic grandeur, yet its message is a sim- ple statement of the triumph of Eternal Life over Death earned by the Sacrifice of Christ, daily re- enacted in the Eucharist. Commencing from the bottom of the painting and proceeding upward along the vertical axis, we pass through the inevit- ability of mortal death, exemplified by the me- mento mori to which the two kneeling donors are witness; the rôle of Divine intercession exemplifi- ed by the Virgin Mary, the Ark of the New Cove- nant and Saint John the Evangelist, beloved Disci- ple and witness; and come vis-à-vis with God's re- sponse to the Te igitur prayer of the faithful in which the Pater accepts the Sacrifice of His Son for the redemption of all humankind. Ultimately in our upward progression, we reach the vault of the sacred aedicula wherein Masaccio in simple numerical iconography has restated and summed up the message set forth in detail below. The visible rows of six coffers per- pendicular to the picture frame recall the Hex- 56</page><page sequence="11">aëmeron, and the Old Covenant, while the parallel bands of eight coffers signify the Resurrection of Christ, the New Adam and the Mediator of the New Covenant52. While the fresco at Scarnafigi (fig. 13) and Masaccio's in Santa Maria Novella (fig. 1) both contemporaneously depict the theme of Salvation through the Sacrifice of Christ and, therefore, should be considered as representations of Eu- charistie rather than Trinitarian motifs, the for- mer harks back to the Mediaeval era while the latter heralds the Renaissance. * This study is an amplification of my paper which was read at the Tenth International Conference of Patristic, Mediaeval and Renaiss- ance Studies at Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania, Septem- ber 1985.

Hirn, The Sacred Shrine: A Study of the Poetry and Art of the Ca- tholic Church, Boston 1957 (1912), 115. It has often been suggested that the position of the Dove of the Holy Spirit in portrayals of the Throne of Grace, wherein either the wings of the bird or parts of its body may be seen to touch the heads or even in some cases the lips of both the Father and the Son, should be understood as supporting the doctrine of joint procession or Filioque by which the confession is made that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. (For an early discussion of this subject in regard to representations of the 57</page><page sequence="12">Throne of Grace, see Didron, II, 1891, 70-72). By default, this argument implies that in situations where this does not occur, either the Eastern belief in the single procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father by the Son or some other meaning, as will be discussed below, must be intended. This author does not wish to dispute the validity of the poss- ible didactic Filioque intentions inherent in some Throne of Grace presentations. However, she would like to suggest that this argument, regardless of its ultimate decision, is not germane to her fundamental thesis that the Dove's presence is essentially an epikletic one regard- less of whence it proceeds. It has also been suggested (Pamplona, 1970, 93) that the inclusion of the Dove within the Throne of Grace image represents the soul of Christ when He cries out, «Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit!» ( Luke 23, 46) and a fifteenth-century panel of the Navarre-Aragon School bearing an incomplete inscription of this text is mentioned in support of the theory (Pamplona, 1970, 117, fig. 57), However, in this instance, it should be pointed out that the Dove, directly above the head of Christ, with the tips of its wings touching the mouth of God the Father and the Son, carries in its beak the «symbolic disc», which it appears to be placing in the upraised hands of the other Persons of the Trinity. This Eucharistie implication in especially illuminating in a Throne of Grace sculptural group from Navarre of the second half of the fourteenth-century (Pamplona, 1970, fig. 39a and 39b) in which the Dove is prominently portrayed carrying the «symbolic disc», on which is written IHS, and placing it within the upraised hands. To the present author, the inclusion of the Host in these and other representations of the same motif is a deliberate and emphatic visual explication of the Eucharistie significance of the Throne of Grace image and unequivocally announces the schema as a Celebration of the Eucharistie Sacrifice in which the Dove of the Holy Spirit performs its epikletic rôle. 18 J. Braun, S J., Der christiliche Altar in seiner geschichtlichen Entwick- lung, Munich 1924, II, 608-19.

Corblet in his work enti- tled Mémoires liturgiques sur les ciboires du moyen âge (Amiens 1842) mentions the complaints made by the Monks of Antioch during the second Council of Nice, held in the eighth-century, against the heretic Severus, «who had appropriated to his own use the doves of gold and silver, suspended above altars and baptismal fonts, under pretence that it was not right to represent the Holy Ghost under the figure of a dove» (Qtd. in Didron, I, 1891, 507).

For the sug- gestion that the epiklesis to the Holy Spirit is visually represented in the Throne of Grace image, see n. 17 above. 20 H. Schrade, Die romanische Malerei Cologne 1963, 212. It should not be thought that this distinction between the Father and the Son, in large-scale works, was consistently made from this time forth, for such was not the case. Examples can be cited of the earlier type still being represented during the fifteenth century; for instance, the so-called Trinità fresco in the church of San Francesco, Cascia, painted c. 1450 and attributed to Bartolomeo di Tommaso, reproduced in M. Salmi, «Il Sassetta di San Martino», Commentari 17 (1966/1-3), fig. 10. However, about 1360, the concept of paternity and filiation became irrevocably fixed (Didron, I, 1891, 215-18), and it became acceptable and even de- sirable to portray God the Father in the guise of the «Ancient of Days», a depiction which reached its apogee in Michalengelo's Sistine Ceiling. It should be mentioned here that the suggestion has been made that the Byzantine formula of God the Father, in the image of Abraham, holding His Infant Son on his lap with the Dove of the Holy Spirit present, constituted the prototype for the Throne of Grace image in the West (A. Heimann, «L'iconographie de la Trinité», Art Chrétien revue, 1, 1934, 37-58). The present author does not agree with this proposi- tion for the reasons stated above. 21 In the usual representation of the Throne of Grace, God the Father is portrayed seated, either on a throne or a rainbow, holding His Cru- cified Son on the Cross. A much rarer type, as shown in Masaccio's painting, with the Father standing and supporting Christ on the Cross is discussed by P. Verdier, La Trinité débout de Champmol, in Études d'art français offertes a Charles Sterling, ed. Albert Châtelet and Nicole Reynaud, Paris 1975, 65-90, figs 44-54. Various hypotheses have been set forth identifying the structure on which Masaccio placed the standing figure of God the Father. See, for example, C. de Tolnay, «Renaissance d'une fresque», L'Oeil, 37 (1958), 38-39, who states that the Father is standing on a sarcophagus which is the sepulcher of Christ To J. Coolidge, «Further Observations on Masaccio's Trinity, The Art Bulletin, 48 (1966/3-4), 383-84, the pylon on which God the Fa- ther stands probably represents a familiar piece of church furniture such as a kind of support on which a bier was placed at some stage in a funeral. U. Schlegel (1963, 27) identifies the support as the ponte, or rood-loft which is actually a «bridge», from which God the Father dis- plays His Crucified Son on the Cross. 22 For the historical background of Scarnafigi and its environs, see L. della Chiesa, Dell'istoria di Piemonte, Bologna 1971 (1608), 46-143, 152- 55, 172-93, 198-223; A.

The Diary is divided into two sec- tions, the first consists of a long allegorical and historical poem in the form of a Moral Interlude written after Pasquieťs return to France, apotheosizing the coronation of Francis and incorporating some mate- rial on his military exploits in Piedmont and Lombardy. The second part appears to be a relatively unrevised copy of the field notes that he made at the actual time that the events described therein occurred, and the buildings and works of art he discussed were before his eyes.

See G. Galante Garrone Bottega del Maestro di Roletto (?), c. 1440, in Giacomo Jaquerio e il gotico internazio- nale, Catalogue, ed. E. Castelnuovo and G. Romano, Turin, Palazzo Madama, 1979, 182-85, 404-07. 29 S. Edmunds, «The Missals of Felix V and Early Savoyard Illumina- tion», The Art Bulletin, 46 (1964/2), 129, n. 13. 30 Edmunds, 1964, 129, fig. 5. 31 Amadeus had numerous artists at court who decorated several chapels for him there as well as elsewhere in addition to painting pan- els and illuminated manuscripts (Gallenga, II, 1856, 475). 32 Artists often sought models in manuscript miniatures for use in large-scale mural paintings, a practice firmly entrenched within French and Italian artistic circles of the fourteenth and fifteenth cen- turies (Didron, II, 1891, 206-07). Nowhere is this emulation of minia- ture painting so pronounced as in the apsebowl frescoes in Scarnafigi, and the master's debt to the French miniaturists is very evident Several examples will serve to explicitly manifest this dependence. The artist of the illumination of Blanche Adoring the Trinity from Les Heures de Savoie, or Très Belles Grandes Heures de Charles V (our fig. 12), now at Yale University, executed about 1348 (Les Heures de Savoie, Facsimiles of Fifty-Two Pages from the Hours Executed for Blanche of Burgundy, being all that is known to survive of a famous Fourteenth-Cen- tury Ms., which was burnt at Turin in 1904, ed. Dom P. Blanchard, Lon- don 1910), utilizes a diaper-pattern to silhouette the figures as also seen in the Scarnafigi fresco, and the portrayal is quite similar save that in the Hours, God the Father is seated upon a throne rather than on a sprung rainbow. In the Throne of Grace illumination from the Belles Heures de Jean, duc de Berry (M. Meiss and E.H. Beatson, The 58</page><page sequence="13">Belles Heures of Jean, Duke of Berry, New York 1974, fol. 204), the flow- ing violet mantle falling loosely over the lap of God the Father with its sharp contrasting of white is echoed in the Scarnafigi fresco. However, the artist of the latter has carried this motif to the extreme, creating an emotionally dramatic and active spiral effect which intensifies the sacramental image. There is an even closer parallel between the Scarnafigi Entombment and that in the Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux (J. Rorimer, Jr., ed., The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, Queen of France, New York 1957, fig. 6). In both, the figures have been positioned in a very similar arrangement. The actual identity of the characters seems to be parallel with the exception that in the Hours the place of the patron or donor is taken by Joseph of Arimathea while Joseph's position at Christ's head is taken by St. John, and an unknown saint has been added to the background. This particular representation of the En- tombment represents a complete break with the thirteenth-century (E. Male, L'art religieux de la fin du moyen âge en France, Paris 1925, 8). A final example appears in the so-called Royal Missal of Felix Vin which the decorated initial for the Second Sunday of Advent includes the de- piction of the Infant Christ, daringly foreshortened, descending to earth (Edmunds, 1964, 130, 132), an obvious reference to a well-known Annunciation motif, also to be found on the triumphal arch in the chapel at Scarnafigi, which will be discussed below. 33 Several examples include the Annunciation fresco in the Church of Santa Maria del Monastero at Manta which reveals a strict correspon- dence with the one at Scarnafigi, and Pisanello's Annunciation in San Fermo, about 1426. It seems quite likely that this particular concetto of the Annunciation scene was very strongly influenced by, if not in ac- tuality originally derived from, the visual image brought to mind by this passage from the Meditations on the Life of Christ written about 1 3Ô0: «But finally the prudent Virgin understood the words of the an- gel and consented, and she knelt with profound devotion and, folding her hands, said, Behold the handmaid of God; let it be to me accord- ing to your word.... At that very point the Spirit was created and placed into the sanctified womb as a human being complete in all parts of His body, though very small and childlike» ( Mediations on the Life of Christ, ed., R.B. Green and I. Ragusa, Princeton 1961, 19). For this motif of the descending Christ Child, see D.M. Robb, «The Iconog- raphy of the Annunciation in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries», The Art Bulletin, 18 (1936), 505, 523-26; M. Schapiro, «A Note on the Merode Altarpiece», The Art Bulletin, 41 (1959), 327-329, and É. Beis- sel, S J., «Un Livre d'Heures appartenant a S.A. le duc ď Arenberg à Bruxelles», Revue de l'Art chrétien, 4e série, 15 (1904/6), 442. For the suggestion that this motif reflected actual stage presentations in which a child slid down a cord, a chain or a tube to establish the connection between heaven and earth, see A. Heimann, «Trinitas Creator Mundi», Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 2 (1938-39), 51. 34 The Catholic Encyclopedia, ed. Charles G. Herbermann, Edward A. Pace, Conde B. Pallen, Thomas J. Shahan, and John J. Wynne, I, New York 1910, 542. 35 On these frescoes at Manta, see note 28 above. These two examples appear to be isolated instances of the Throne of Grace image being ut- ilized in apse-bowl mural paintings. 36 While three human figures interpreted as representing the Trinity had already appeared in the mosaics of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome in the fifth century and in San Vitale in Ravenna in the sixth, this new type of anthropomorphism of portraying in human form the three Divine Persons appears, perhaps for the first time, in a manu- script which Saint Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, had in his pos- session at the time of his death in 908, in which the Father and Son are clad in kingly apparel wearing crowns and appear to be about thirty-five years old, while the Holy Spirit is represented as being about twenty or twenty-five. In Abbess Herrad of Landsberg's Hortus Deliciarum of about 1 170-1 180, there is now no difference between the Figures with the exception of nail holes in the feet of the center Per- son (Didron, II, 1891, 40-41). For the suggestion that this type of repre- sentation of three men shows the influence of the theatre, being the only practicable form of the Trinity for the stage, see Heimann, 1938- 39, 48. While these figures are separate, later, however, as in the Trin- ity fresco at Scarnafigi, the three identical Divine Persons merge to- gether into a single body, although still portrayed seated side-by-side on a throne or dias. It is interesting to note that several of these un- usual compositions have been located in the environs of Scarnafigi in southwest Piedmont in the old Marquisate of Saluzzo. See Bressy, 1971, 508. Cf. P. Verdier, The iconography of the Holy Trinity, in The New Catholic Encyclopedia, XIV, Washington 1967, 307. 37 Beissel, 1904, 442. Cf. M. Meiss, Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death, Princeton 1951, 34-35, 104, fig. 50, and Braunfels, 1954, XXXV-XLI, figs. 38-39, 42. 38 Schrade, 1963, 212. The suggestion has been made that the diminu- tion of Christ's figure in a Throne of Grace image may be attributed to the fact that what is represented is actually the soul of Christ rather than His dead body (Pamplona, 1970, 93). However, the present author cannot accept this opinion in view of the Eucharistie symbolism of the Agnus Dei inherent in a Throne of Grace representation. See n. 17 above. As Schrade (1963, 212) points out, the artist portrayed the Cru- cified One smaller than the other figure to symbolize the bloodless sacrifice on the altar that would be offered at the time of the Te igitur prayer to the Clementissime Pater. 39 Masaccio has combined a Throne of Grace representation with that of the Crucifixion manifesting the reality of Christ's death on the Cross, including symbolically the Mount of Golgotha as well as Mary and John, which is sacramentally re-enacted in the Eucharist on the altar. The antecedents for this schema can be traced to Early Byzan- tine art in which the Crucifixion image comprised Christ on the Cross, Mary on the right of the Cross and John on the left, with the requisite words addressed by Christ to them depicted in the form of inscrip- tions (Schiller, II, 1971, 94). It is to the Soest Retable (fig. 4) that we turn again for, perhaps, the first large-scale example of the fusion of the Crucifixion scene with that of the Throne of Grace image. For the significance of Mary's appearance in the Crucifixion scene as a medi- ating figure which fulfills a very human function of linking Christ and the viewer through her emotion as she grieves for her dead Son, see S.G. Nichols, Jr., Romanesque Signs: Early Medieval Narrative and icon- ography, New Haven 1983, 113-121. For John's rôle in the Crucifixion and the favored position to which Christian tradition, reflected in art, has assigned the Evangelist over the other Gospel writers, see M. Schapiro, Two Romanesque Drawings in Auxerre and Some Iconographie Problems, in Studies in Art and Literature for Belle da Costa Greene, ed. Dorothy Miner, Princeton 1954, 334-38. 40 On the Old and New Testament exegetic typology of Mary as the new and perfect ark, the living tabernacle of the divine presence, and the living ark carrying Jesus, see M. O'Carroll, C.S. Sp., Theotokos: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Wilmington 1 982, 49-51. Cf. Hirn, 1957, 163-64, 454-62, 550-51. The proposal has been set forth in this present study that the Throne of Grace image is a symbolic representation of the Eucharistie sacrifice and nowhere does this appear to be more explicit than in the Vierge ouvrante, a carved shrine of the seated Madonna and Child popular in the thirteenth and fourteenth-centuries. The two halves of Mary's body could be frontally opened to reveal a sculptural image of the Throne of Grace. Herein, the Virgin's womb, hailed as the templům sanctum Dei, visually houses the symbol of the Eucharistie sacrifice analogous to the liturgical tab- ernacle which houses the consecrated Hosts. For reproductions of an early fourteenth-century example, in both the closed and open posi- tions, see B.G. Lane, The Altar and the Altarpiece: Sacramental Themes in Early Netherlandish Painting New York 1984, figs. 17, 18. Cf. Hirn, 1957, 321-22. The close linkage between the Incarnation in Mary, «the dwelling-place of the Host» (Hirn, 1957, 171), and the Eucharist can be seen in representations in which the Annunciation and the Throne of Grace are combined within the same composition. For example, two Florentine works painted between 1400-02 may be cited. In the first, attributed to a follower of Bicci di Lorenzo, The Throne of Grace and Annunciation are depicted directly above the Madonna and Child, sharing the same gold background of the panel (F. Rusk Shapley, Paint- ings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: Italian Schools XIII-XV Cen- tury, London 1966, fig. 119). The other, Lorenzo di Niccolo's Corona- tion of the Virgin (1402), originally on the high altar of the Church of San Marco, now in San Domenico, Cortona, has in the superstructure above the three central panels, a Throne of Grace in the center with the Annunciation scene portrayed on either side (Cole, 1980, fig. 33). In this regard, in the chapel in Scarnafigi (fig. 8), the Annunciation scene on the triumphal arch, incorporating graphically the Incarnate Infant, embraces the image of the Throne of Grace in the apse-bowl. On the Paschasian approach to the Eucharist in connection with the Incarnation, see G. Macy, The Theologies of the Eucharist in the Early Scholastic Period: A Study of the Salvific Function of the Sacrament ac- cording to the Theologians c. 1080-c. 1220, Oxford 1984, 44-72. Cf. O'Car- roll, 1982, 137-138. 41 On the theology of Mary as the type of the Church and the eminent exemplar in faith and charity, see O'Carroll, 1982, 100-101, 139-141, 305-309, 346-347. Cf. Lane, 1984, 25-27, 86-90, 95, and Polzer, 1971, 43. 42 It is suggested that the antecedents for this compositional scheme can be found in sculptural decorations on architectural monuments, as, for example, the life-size figures of the two donors flanking the por- tal of the Chartreuse at Champmol. On this monument and the func- tion of the portal as entrance into the realm of the sacred, see K.M. Birkmeyer, «The Arch Motif in Netherlandish Painting of the Fifteenth Century», The Art Bulletin, 43 (1961), 12-13. 43 Schlegel, 1963, 19, 25-27; Berti, 1967, 117, 157 n. 270; Dempsey, 1972, 279-81; Tolnay, 1958, 36-41, and Cole, 1980, 176-82. 44 Tolnay, 1958, 38. 45 Schiller, II, 1971, 130-31, figs. 390, 391. 46 Schiller, II, 1971, 131, fig. 389. 47 The fourth-century Epiphanius of Salamis, in his commentary on Matthew 27, 51-3, professes belief in Adam's salvation saying that «Adam was buried at Golgotha, which is called Calvary because of the presence of his skull; and that the water and blood from the cross flowed down upon his bones as if to say "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead"» (W. Telfer, «The Fourth Century Greek Fa- 59</page><page sequence="14">thers as Exegetes», The Harvard Theological Review, 50 (1957/2), 98-99. For the typology of Adam, see Schiller, II, 1971, 95, 97-98, 123, 130- 133, and T. Dobrzeniecki, «The Toruñ Quinity in the National Museum in Warsaw», The Art Bulletin, 46 (1964/3), 386-387. 48 Schiller, II, 1971, fig. 15. 49 Hildburgh, 1932, 84, fig. 7. The depiction of the skull beneath the Cross became the preferred symbol for the washing away of Adam's sin and many examples are extant. See, for instance, Schiller, II, 1971, figs. 507, 508, 516, 519, 552, 560, and 563. 50 See Berti, 1967, 158, n. 277; Tolnay, 1958, 38; Polzer, 1971, 50-53; Schlegel, 1963, 24-26; Cole, 1980, 179, and Dempsey, 1972, 279-81. 5 1 Opinion is varied on the interpretation of the memento mori in Ma- saccio's painting. For example, Dempsey (1972, 281) and Tolnay (1958, 38) suggest that it is intended to be the skeleton of Adam, Coolidge (1966, 382) and Polzer (1971, 44) suggest some relationship to a tomb, while Schlegel (1963, 28) postulates that the skeleton at the feet of the donors is «a reminder to them, and to all beholders, of Judgment Day and the transience of earthly things». 52 For alternate interpretations of the number of transverse rows of coffers, see Janson, 1967, 83 and Polzer, 1971, 54.

David Knowles, Middlesex, Eng. 1972, repr. 1976, 1977, 465. On the number eight and its Anastasian symbolism in re- gard to ecclesiastical architecture, see R.
