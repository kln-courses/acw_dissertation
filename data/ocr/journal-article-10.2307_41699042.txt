<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT'S DRAMA: Platonic 'Ideas' versus Aristotelian 'Shapes' Maryam Beyad Amir Maniee In questioning representation, (post)modern literature and art emphasized meta-representation and the philosophy and critique of art. In the same vein, Samuel Beckett was concerned with the nature of art and the shape(s) to accommodate his message(s). Any attempt, however, to analyze 'idea' and 'shape' revives Plato's and Aristotle's classic debate about 'form' and 'con- tent.' Through a close reading of Waiting for Godot and Endgame, as well as sketching a parallel between Beckett's techniques and the concept of mathe- matical limit, this article argues that although Platonic and Aristotelian no- tions on art appear to be far apart, they overlap in Beckett's drama.

Introduction Classical thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle as well as writers in different eras have devoted much of their time defining, analyzing, and evaluating issues of content and form. Questions raised about the meaning of 'idea' and its 'shape' have made a substantial impact on the philosophy of art and creative artists over the centuries, including our own. Among different forms of art, postmodern spectacle has provided a remarkable context for thinking about the philosophy of art. The foundations of art are subverted in order to show that its seeming meaningfulness dissipates. In this subversion, content and form are both used as mediums to question their own positions and definitions. Such subversions and the uncertain boundaries for content and form</page><page sequence="2">320 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee are highlighted in Beckett's works. One of Beckett's frequently- quoted statements illustrates his views about form and structure: I take no sides. I am interested in the shape of ideas even if I do not believe in them. There is a wonderful sentence in Augustine. I wish I could remember the Latin. It is even finer in Latin than in English. 'Do not despair; one of the thieves was saved. Do not presume: one of the thieves was damned.' That sentence has a wonderful shape. It is the shape that matters. (qtd. in Worton, 75) In this respect, Beckett's use of these two elements could be interpret- ed as an attempt to revive the classic arguments and theories about art. In fact, Beckett tries to provide us with a philosophical art that is sim- ultaneously a representation and a meta-representation implying that in a (post)modern text and context, the issues of content and form are not very clear-cut and may in fact overlap. This overlap could be in- terpreted either as a cause creating postmodern works or as an effect created by postmodern art. The overlap between content and form can be traced back to Plato's philosophy of art and his objections to art as such. His main objection is an epistemological one stemming from his theory of knowledge. He argues that if true reality consists of the ideas of things, of which objects are but reflections or imitations, then anyone who imitates the objects is imitating an imitation and therefore pro- ducing something that is doubly removed from ultimate reality. Ac- cording to Plato's Republic, two allegories can be sketched to elabo- rate on his theory: a) Allegory of the Divided Line: World Hierarchy Mind Hierarchy Pure Form, Idea, Logos Abstraction, Pure thought</page><page sequence="3">Beckett's Drama 321 Mathematical entities, Mathematical knowledge Geometrical shapes Physical objects, Substance Opinion, Doxa (Scientist) Representation of the outside worlc Illusion (Artist) Mimesis, Anthropomorphism, Image b) The Allegory of the Cave: Reflection in a Mirror Body "^Spiqt Objective reality Light^^^ Physical aspects (what humans see) X Aristotle, on the other hand, as the first practical literary theorist, ex- amines form as the principal element of art. His concern is an ontolog- ical one of discovering what in fact literature is rather than a norma- tive one, describing what it should be. As emphasized by David Daiches, Aristotle's study of unity and organization in the Poetics shows that he was conscious of form and aware of the pleasure to be derived from the interaction of various formal elements in a literary whole. Aristotle argues that owing to the refined use of formal ele- ments by the artist, a work of art provides a profound insight into the reality of things and therefore, epistemologically speaking, it could be much closer to the 'Real' than are objects. As Daiches explains, Aristotle defends art against Plato's accusa- tion that it is an imitation of an imitation when he discusses the rela- tionship between poetry (art) and history. Aristotle argues that history tries to report facts as they are; it deals with the particular, whereas poetry deals with the universal. That is to say, "the poet does not simply imitate or represent particular events or situations [...]; he handles them in such a way that he brings out their universal and</page><page sequence="4">322 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee characteristic elements" (Daiches, 37). In the world created by the artist there is a "formal probability" that implies two main points ac- cording to Daiches: (a) "The notion that a historical falsehood maybe an ideal truth, that is to say a probable impossibility may reflect a more profound reality than an improbable possibility;" and (b) "A work has a unity and a formal perfection of its own, a work which thus creates its own world of probability within which truth can be recognized and appreciated" (38). 2. Waiting for Godot The pivotal elements of Beckett's Waiting for Godot are, as the title specifies, the ideas of waiting and expectation. ESTRAGON. Charming spot. {He turns , advances to front, halts facing auditorium.) Inspiring prospects. {He turns to Vladimir .) Let's go. VLADIMIR. We can't. ESTRAGON. Why not? VLADIMIR. We're waiting for Godot. (13-14) The audience accepts the situation and shares the anxiety, pain and pleasure of waiting with the characters on stage, expecting something to happen. This temporarily satisfies both parties to pass the time and to wait for Godot. In fact, Beckett makes use of the very basic element of theatre, expectation, as the central issue of his own play and this expectation lingers on both in the content and the form. From the very beginning, the audience is informed of a character by the name of Godot whose presence is not verified through physical existence on the stage but through the words exchanged between the other charac- ters. One could claim that Beckett has provided the exposition of his play in general and of Godot in particular, but this exposition does not lead the audience anywhere in the sense that is expected in an Aristo- telian spectacle: VLADIMIR. Well? What do we do? ESTRAGON. Don't let's do anything. It's safer. VLADIMIR. Let's wait and see what he says.</page><page sequence="5">Beckett's Drama 323 ESTRAGON. Who? VLADIMIR. Godot. (18) Elaborating on Beckett's ideas about Godot and the interpretations the play elicits, Michael Worton refers to Beckett's own words: Beckett once asserted: "I produce an object. What people make of it is not my concern [...] I'd be quite incapable of writing a critical introduction to my own works." Furthermore, whenever directors and critics asked for explanations of Godot, he both side-stepped their questions and revealed his distrust for any kind of exegesis. [...] To Alan Schneider's question "Who or what does Godot mean?", he replied, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play"; [...] Beckett's position remained resolute; he want- ed no part in the process of decoding that haunts critical work, preferring to cling to his belief that: "The key word in my plays is 'perhaps'." (67) At all times Beckett tried to avoid boundaries, definitions, and dog- mas, and in doing so he practiced different themes and techniques. As the title of the play suggests, the whole story is about an absence, a lack of something, but interestingly enough this absence is present throughout the performance, reinforcing an old yet novel philosophi- cal/artistic tension about the 'howness' of being and not being simul- taneously. One of Beckett's major anxieties in this play was the authority of the text and the influence one might experience by being exposed to various texts of the past. To imply this anxiety through his spectacle, Beckett relies on meta-textuality. In doing so, he focuses on various texts of the past but also establishes prominent stage props in this re- flection. In this sense, the act of writing is foregrounded as the most fundamentally problematic aspect of that very text. And the play draws the audience's attention to its process of artificiality by aban- doning the pre-established expectations of allegories and meanings. This is to spotlight the very nature of narratives to create artificial 'real' and imaginary worlds in the guise of truth:</page><page sequence="6">324 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee VLADIMIR. Did you ever read the Bible? ESTRAGON. The Bible... {He reflects.) I must have taken a look at it. VLADIMIR. Do you remember the Gospels? ESTRAGON. I remember the maps of the Holy Land. Coloured they were. Very pretty. (12) The Bible is simply a book for Estragon, a book to look at, to read, to enjoy, or maybe to comment on, but after all it is only a book. How- ever, he does not believe it to be 'Gospel truth.' Beckett's use of the Bible as a grand narrative whose authority is suspect could represent the very idea of decentralization of any text as a truth to hold on to. The conversation continues to the extent that the two tramps discuss the passage about the Saviour and the thieves, but, because the authen- ticity of the story is in question, Estragon uses the term "version" when he refers to the Gospels and the stories in them. As Michel Fou- cault and others have emphasized, for a single signified there are in- numerous signifiers but none of them represents the real signified. On a philosophic level, Plato discussed this multiplicity of versions while commenting on anthropomorphic art. For him, such art is not genuine owing to the fact that mimesis is far removed from the reality of the object in question. In Beckett's play, in addition to the meta-textuality of allusions within the dialogue, there is substantial reliance on the stage props to reinforce the tramps' skeptical attitude toward the simulacrum. The stage props become a key medium to indicate the failure of the deno- tative and connotative significance of objects. One of the major props utilized by Beckett is the tree, which has a great potentiality for vari- ous allusions, interpretations, and symbols. Ironically enough, Vladi- mir and Estragon are not even sure if it is a tree, guessing it might be a bush or a shrub. Not only the literal meanings are under interrogation, but also the symbolic level of language is rendered suspect through a flux of miscommunication. The audience and characters are left in a labyrinth in which there is no full stop. The unstable discourse leads the audience into a centreless maze in which no concrete meaning can be grasped for long, and as soon as an image is provided with a refer- ence, it is replaced by another one. As a result, this unstable process causes instability of the signifiers in relation to the signifieds through-</page><page sequence="7">Beckett's Drama 325 out the whole performance. One might say that the self-referentiality of Beckett's drama highlights the very basic concept of the arbitrari- ness of our world and our system of communication. It seems that the very emphasis on the aspects of language and props as formal ele- ments contributes to the structure of the play, or in Beckett's own words, to its "shape." Relying on Beckett's comment that "It is the shape that matters," one could infer that for Beckett, structure is of greater consequence than the message, but this leads to a paradox. In fact, he tries to rely on formal elements to communicate his Platonic ideas on representa- tion and simulacrum. To convey his message, he is bound to rely on technique and structure, but these techniques represent an idea of the Real and not the Real itself. However, Viktor Shklovsky defends this shortcoming of technique in his famous article "Art as Technique": The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects "unfamiliar", to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. Art is a way of experiencing the artfulness of an object: the object is not important. (qtd. in Davis and Schleifer, 58) On the other hand, throughout (post)modern performances, dramatists try to say that the stage is a simulacrum, but to say so they need a style enabling them to combine different elements into a literary whole. One way to emphasize the function of literary conventions and to re- veal the nature of formal elements is to make them malfunction. In breaking rules and defamiliarising the audience, parody, pastiche, and inversion come to the fore. Indeed, the clownish characters, language, or even props in Waiting for Godot , almost all serve as anti-climatic elements to create irony: ESTRAGON. [...] {Estragon lays his hand on Vladimir's shoul- der) Come Didi. {Silence.) Give me your hand. {Vladimir half turns.) Embrace me! {Vladi- mir softens. They embrace. Estragon recoils.) You stink of gar- lic!</page><page sequence="8">326 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee VLADIMIR. It's good for the kidneys. {Silence. Estragon looks attentively at the tree.) What do we do now? ESTRAGON. Wait. (17) By focusing on a linguistic form that incorporates a critique of lan- guage, the play spotlights the tension between Aristotelian formal elements and Platonic concepts about the Real.' Jacques Derrida elab- orates on these parallel features of language in his famous article "Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," maintaining that "Language bears within itself the necessity of its own critique" (197). The tension comes from the fact that although lan- guage can be used as a medium to describe its own nature, it lacks the means to communicate what it wants to convey. The failure to estab- lish a bridge between the signifier and the signified becomes the anxi- ety of artists who consequently use different techniques to foreground miscommunication and misinterpretation. Beckett, as we know, is particularly preoccupied with notions of language and language as a medium or form to represent the 'Real.' He employs paradox, puns, repetitions, and inversions in an attempt to disrupt the predictable semantic effects of language. The extreme repetition of words, for instance, turns them into worn-out sounds, proving the point that a word is only a representation of the truth and not the truth itself. On the other hand, Beckett's semantic disruptions lend added importance to form: akin to other artists, what he wants to communicate is to be transmitted through technique and structure. To find a form to be in accord with the subject has, of course, been a burning issue for artists in different eras and especially during the postmodern epoch. In the young Beckett's words about Joyce's Work in Progress : "Here form is content, content is form" (1984, 27; emphasis in the original). The playful self-reflexivity of postmodern art entails a situation in which the message and the framework intermingle without recognizable distinction. In this manner, Beckett questions the 'Real' (Platonic pure abstraction - the unpresentable) through a set of (Aristotelian) tech- niques. Although we cannot be certain, Beckett could conceivably have known about the significance Plato attached to geometry and music, requiring them for entry into his academy ( Republic 7.526c8-527cl 1). Plato believed that in the hierarchy of the cosmos, mathematics is</page><page sequence="9">Beckett's Drama Till second only to 'pure ideas.' For him, mathematical abstractness and geometrical shapes are closest to pure ideas or the logos. While Plato studied the metaphysical status of mathematical objects, Aristotle studied logic and the objective side of mathematics. In order to represent the notion of Platonic metaphysics, artists need to make use of the physical world and its various structures. In this sense, what Beckett did was to take some primary mathematical factors into consideration to show his perception of pure abstractness. Vladimir vs. Estragon, Pozzo vs. Lucky, Act 1 vs. Act 2, one boot vs. another may all imply Beckett's attachment to mathematical entities that are put into repetitive cycles. As a repetitive play, in which noth- ing is repeated twice and which circles on to an unfathomable illusory ending, Godot establishes an expectation of finality, the universal human tendency to await an ending. To view an artistic work from a mathematical point of view or to view mathematics from an artistic point of view seems to be a major motivation for Beckett in writing Waiting for Godot and his other plays. Beckett's play can be usefully sketched in terms of the mathe- matical definition of a 'limit.' According to Webster's Dictionary , a limit is: "a number whose numerical difference from a mathematical function is arbitrarily small for all values of the independent variables that are sufficiently close to but not equal to given prescribed numbers or that are sufficiently large positively or negatively" (693). The analogy between forms in literature and a limit as a subject in pure mathematics is an intriguing one. While in the case of a math- ematical limit, a parameter such as X approaches a number such as 1 (value) to the extent that it is very close to that number (1), as if it was the number itself, there is still a very small difference between the two figures, that is to say, between 'X' and '1.' Therefore, 'X' cannot be equated with '1'; instead, it is an attempt to approximate it. Indeed, from the point of view of the Barthesian open-ended text, one might claim that any attempt to close a text or to equate a text (parameter) with a certain value (number) - in the mathematical sense - is to reach a full stop and an end to inquiries. In Godot , however, a number of people are waiting for an ultimate full-stop that cannot be seen, heard, or even grasped. In fact, the very idea of getting close no matter to what extent would seem to be more exciting and enigmatic than the intended result itself. As time passes, hopes are largely shattered, but some hope remains simply because the characters are living with the</page><page sequence="10">328 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee idea that they are close to the awaited event, as if Godot were almost there. So, why not spend one more day on the same country road, recycling the same words, habitualizing life, until the awaited eventu- ally appears. The inclination of the number is towards finality, and in this process the number approaches finality. 'X' is approaching a mathematical entity but never reaches that entity or number in the entire continuous advancement. It is clear is that Beckett had no intention of making a reductive analysis of this play or to limit its significance. In fact, Beckett made use of different theatrical techniques to convey his message(s) be- cause, for him, the process seemed to be more important than the product. By the same token, interpreting the idea of 'expectation' from a mathematical point of view should not be taken as an assumption that Godot refers to a mathematical entity. What should be taken into consideration is that the whole performance looks like a mathematical advancement towards a final entity. In this manner Beckett sketched a parallel with the philosophy of mathematics to shed light on his own ideas about Platonic subjectivism and Aristotelian objectivism. For Beckett, Platonic subjectivism could be claimed as that final entity which is never more than an inclination, and to show this inclination the only possible way is to rely on the objective side of the world which is described here as mathematical limit. Mathematicians need to rely on applied mathematics as their means of representation to signify pure mathematical entities, and by the same token, if artists want to represent Platonic subjectivism, they have to rely on the objective side of representation, which is form or technique. 3. Endgame In Endgame, four grotesque characters anticipate an apocalypse that is yet to come. Yet, ironically enough, the game lingers on without any concrete emergence of such an event. Clov sets the tone at the outset: "Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished. {Pause.) Grain upon grain, one by one, and one day, suddenly, there's heap, a little heap, the impossible heap. {Pause. y (12). For B. S. Hammond, time in Endgame "is experienced not as a linear development, towards a goal, but as a yawning vacuum, a black hole without structure" (37). If so, then no matter or radiation can ever escape the gravitational field. Perhaps one could describe the stage as</page><page sequence="11">Beckett's Drama 329 a cosmological spectacle in which the microcosm and macrocosm are speeding up to attain a point that is within reach and yet unreachable (implying a mathematical limit). The unreachable here could be the endgame itself, which is unpresentable and abstract (Platonic). The pure abstractness of the content needs a form to be presented; howev- er, no matter what form is utilized, it cannot fully present or represent that abstractness. Thus, in order to imply the unpresentable the artist exhausts forms to reach a final one. In this process, formlessness be- comes a form to represent the unpresentable. Beckett enables the audi- ence to experience an endgame only by making it impossible to see one, and this is done especially through a chain of fragmented dia- logues that revolves around the idea of an ending. HAMM. Do you not think this has gone on long enough? CLOV. Yes! {Pause) What? HAMM. This. . .this. . .thing. CLOV. I've always thought so .(Pause.) You not? HAMM, (gloomily). Then it's a day like any other day. (33) Pauses and silences occur throughout Endgame and Beckett's other plays. One could argue that Beckett utilizes silence, among many oth- er elements, as a theatrical form to express formless abstract ideas (the unpresentable of the intelligent world). Silence, used as a form (Aris- totelian), is by essence formless, and therefore, could possibly signify the idea of the formlessness of the intelligible world (Platonic). Maybe Beckett did not see himself as a postmodern artist, but there is at least one significant characteristic of his works that per- suades critics to categorize him as such: his craving to master form through formlessness. When it comes to abstractness, choosing the proper technique(s) becomes a difficult task. For instance, infinity can only be represented through a tangible stage, which ironically fails to convey the message or to provide an absolute and inclusive definition of infinity. What remains then are innumerable interpretations of the work, and its details are thus only a case or cases and not the 'Real' itself. This type of art, which reminds the audience of the invisible, is called "modern" by Jean-François Lyotard: "I shall call modern the art which devotes its 'little technical expertise' (son 'petit technique'), as Diderot used to say, to present the fact that the 'unpresentable' exists.</page><page sequence="12">330 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee To make visible that there is something which can be conceived and which can neither be seen or made visible" (334). According to Plato, human knowledge and conventions are sub- ject to skepticism because of their arbitrary and mimetic nature. This unreliability of human knowledge and judgments is evident in several occasions of Beckett's drama, such as the dispute between Hamm and Clov about being in the centre: HAMM. Am I right in the centre? CLOV. I'll measure it. HAMM. More or less! More or less! (23) "To be right in the centre," as determined by logic, is the anxiety of Hamm. His is a binary view of centricity: he is either in the centre or not. Clov, on the other hand, has a fuzzy view of the issue. To Clov, things are a matter of "more or less" rather than "to be or not to be." Therefore, Hamm' s outlook could be viewed as logocen- tric/Aristotelian, whereas Clov' s is delogocentric/Platonic. In Platonic terms, what humans consider the 'Real' is not exactly the 'Real' but a perception of reality that changes depending on the standpoint taken. In terms of the mathematical limit and Derridean discourse, a signifier in approaching a centre of meaning may get very close to it without ever reaching it. As a result, a signifier is replaced by another one, and then another and another in a process of deferred significations so as to represent the Platonic unpresentable. "Today," "yesterday," "that bloody awful day" or "one April afternoon" all seem to be only a set of signifiers that have no external existence whatsoever. In a black hole, matter does not mean anything; as a result, its subordinates such as distance or time sound absurd. In an atemporal and aspatial atmosphere the very definitions on which lives are based begin to shatter, and words become a set of sounds resonating endlessly in outer space. As soon as any attempt is made to shape a consensus and get the audience involved in the play, the char- acters shift from one subject or place to another. Beckett made use of a number of techniques to emphasize the play's atemporality and aspatiality by means of these temporal and spatial breakdowns. One technique, which is of course not unique to Endgame , is the idea of playing games, as well as the overemphasis on the word 'play' so</page><page sequence="13">Beckett's Drama 33 1 as to create a constant confusion in the mind of the audience as to whether the characters are confessing that they are acting or simply talking about a game to play such as chess. Hamm' s first words in the play can be given this significance: "Me - {he yawns) - to play" (12). This statement is crucial, and in the formalistic sense absolutely essen- tial to the totality of the work, since it reminds the audience of what is about to take place. The character of Hamm, already exhausted from the previous show, is there to play again this evening, but reluctant to do so, he "yawns." Yet there being no way out, he has to play what he has to play. From the outset, Beckett implies that this is a show and not reality (let alone the Platonic realm of pure ideas). The audience is cautioned not to wait for an ending that would permit a grasping of the 'Real.' Perhaps Endgame is an inquiry more concerned with the be- ginning of the show rather than an ending to it. 4. Conclusion One of Beckett's major anxieties was to find frameworks into which his messy abstract ideas could fit. In the absence of an appropriate framework, artists may choose silence as their ultimate form to "ac- commodate the mess" (Beckett, qtd. in Driver, 23). As Peter Boxali suggests, Beckett's work, "rather than tending towards the maximum of expressiveness, appears to tend towards the minimum. [...] Beckett uses words to whittle away words until words, exhausted, plead to stop" (95-96). Wearing Platonic glasses, one might describe the impli- cations of Beckett's use of silence in his plays as his advancement towards a form that is formless and capable of representing the unpre- sentable, or in Beckett's own terms, of accommodating "the mess." Supposing that the mess or content Beckett wanted to accommodate is the pure abstractness of the intelligible world, then he would appear to have no choice but to rely on the visible world and its visible objects to find a proper accommodation. However, the very moment Beckett tried to find such a form, he realized that the visible world and its ob- jective realities do not lend a proper form for accommodating ab- stractness. On this basis, Beckett tried various dramatic techniques one of which was making use of silence. Perhaps Beckett chose silence as a formless form to represent formlessness. This choice per se, could be described as the 'achieved form,' or the 'content,' in the formalists' terms. But it is even more striking if we compare the idea of formlessness as an abstractness with</page><page sequence="14">332 Maryam Byad &amp; Amin Maniee Beckett's interest in mathematical entities of the intelligible world. Silence, as we have seen, is a formless form that could be described as the artist's attempt to accommodate the mess, which in our case is pure abstractness, or "the unpresentable" in Derridean terms. Alt- hough the chosen form (silence) cannot accommodate or be equated with an "unpresentable" content, it is an attempt to advance little by little towards this content. In this sense choosing silence as a tech- nique is comparable to the mathematical limit. As such, formlessness plays a dual role for Beckett. Firstly, it is a form that represents ab- stract concepts. And secondly, it nearly becomes content simply be- cause formlessness is an idea, a pure abstract idea that can neither be grasped nor explained within the realm of the objective world. Although it may be difficult to determine whether the Beckettian overlap between content and form tends more toward the Platonic or the Aristotelian view, what can be said with certainty is that Beckett's spectacle is the manifestation of a striking dialogue with the two clas- sical philosophers' notions of art.
