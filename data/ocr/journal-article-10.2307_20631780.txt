Gordon Wheeler. Ulster Archi tectural Heritage Society, 66 Donegall Pass, Bel fast BT7 1BU. 84 pp Stg?8 pb 21 x 122 cm 0-900457-51-1. After its inauguration in Bel fast's city hall in 1921, the first Northern Ire land parliament continued meeting in the Presbyterian Assembly's college until in 1932 a magnificent new building occupying part of the estate of Stormont Castle (still there with its Scottish-baronial turrets) outside Belfast was ready to receive it. Nobody would have expected any ground-breaking modern de sign, so nobody was disappointed: it was a fine example of municipal Greek temple such as Queen victoria might have relished, with an Ionic portico topped by Britannia and some lions, its tympanum containing a sculp ture representing either Britain handing the torch or liberty to Northern Ireland or the lat ter offering the flame of loyalty to the Crown. What made the building outstanding was the height of the site, and the vista subtended by its approach. This collection of pieces by ex perts tells of the choice of site, the design and building of the parliament and government offices and, after a sketch of the building's use and maintenance over the years, the fire in the Commons chamber in 1995 and the subse quent restoration. Throughout there is a wealth of photos old and new (the latter in variably in fine colour); the whole is well bal anced and finely designed: a worth memento, finely printed on a satiny paper. * + -* // ART Celtic Borders. Aidan Meehan. Thames &amp; Hudson 96 pp Stg?6.95 pb 28 x 21 cm 0-500-28067-3. This is of bigger format than his popular Celtic Design series, but follows the same scheme in that the whole book, text and all, is originated by the author's pen. He provides twenty basic designs and guidance on copying or originating them (they aren't supposed to be 'clip art', but inevitably some will be used that way). They are almost all maze or knot borders and all on very broad strips, based on medieval originals but with out the abandonment and freedom that such originals tend to boast: Meehan is a great man for geometric exactitude and perfection of fit and of repetition. The typographer or book designer looking for restraint and the subtle touch of the calligrapher will not find what he wants here. The originator of a menu or certif icate or poster that needs celticity applied with a trowel will be more satisfied. The odd thing is that Meehan's text lettering is legible and understated to the point of modesty: you'd expect him to decorate such text (if at all) with Celtic versions of the sort of borders that Elizabeth Friedlander once designed for Linotype, pure and clean. As it is, you're lucky to get away without shamrocks? though in fact his 'tree of life' leaves might be so interpreted. // Profile 8: Maud Cotter, ed. John O'Regan. Gandon Editions. 47 pp ?7.50 pb 0-946846-07-3. 24 pages of colour reproductions of her pieces (mostly 3D) and installations, with an essay on and interview with her by Luke Clancy. As with the next book, the design and production are immaculate. We liked one of the inter viewer's questions: (about a painting of a cloud with a metal cage and a bundle of cop per and/or paper strips) "It is very interesting that a model of the body seems to work better if it's disintegrated. Do you ever look upon it as an anthropomorphic piece?" She replies "Yes, because it is a funerary piece. When I wrapped the [strips] in finely woven copper mesn, I felt like I was wrapping a piece of the body that had died nameless..."

AUTOBIOGRAPHY The Light in the Window. June Goulding. Poolbeg. 208 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85371-892-0. Memories of a midwife who, newly qualified in 1951, went to work in a home for unmarried mothers. A simple pe riod piece, very human. * * / CRITICISM Writing the North : the contemporary novel inNorthern Ireland. Laura Pelaschiar. EdizioniParnasof Trieste. 158ppStg?8/DM20/ Lire 20.000pb 88-86474-15-6. In small, neat for mat and a typeface no bigger than what you're reading, a very interesting and quite wideranging study in English, which consid ers not just the troubles in fiction but also the urban as against the rural, and 'place and self, and attempts (and very well accomplishes) a 'short sketch' of Northern Irish history as well. There is a bibliography, but no index. In a book of this sort from Insh, British or Ameri can publishers, the odd error would leap at us from the page. Here, not one (as we wrote this 'consiousness' hit us from page 94 as an ex ception!), and if Dr Pelaschiar is not a native English speaker she's remarkable. We seldom see books from Italy; it is a combination of modesty and quality that makes this one ad mirable. The publisher's enclosure slip speaks of 'omaggio'.We return it. * // ETHICS Medical Ethics : an introduction. Ken neth Kearon. Columba with APCK. 125 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85607-125-1. Revised edition of the book published in 1995 by a reverend lecturer at the Church of Ireland Theological College and at Trinity College. This is one of the topica] sub ject areas?so grey and soft the line between life and death at both ends of human life is be coming?on which there has been a good deal of book publishing, but we'd think Kearon is more succinct, clear and wideranging, and less dogmatic, than any of the rest. The obvi ous dilemmas are covered one by one, as are the no less agonising ones that the public per haps don't think of. There's a short list of fur ther suggested reading. ++ -* * // HISTORY Anglo-Saxon Appetites : food and drink and their consumption in Old English and related literature. Hugh Magennis. Four Courts Press. 195 pp Stg?40 hb 1-85182-382-4. Four Courts has carved itself out quite a cor ner in early English and Anglo-Saxon studies, and here is an interesting monograph by a lec turer at Queens which examines the curious absence of references to food in the Germanic tradition (while boozing always got good write-ups), various exceptions, the interest ing fact that Anglo-Saxon had, like modern German, separate words for human eating and animal eating (etan andfretan: why didn't Treating' survive into modern English?) and finally references in Christian writings, on the eucharist for instance and 'be oferfylle' (on gluttony) and druncennysse. A handsome book in the oxbridge tradition, and probably not for amateurs, though all the quoted pas sages are provided with translations.

The first vol ume?Text and historiography by Russell Rees?was listed in this column last Decem ber, and was a remarkably detailed account of the period, each chapter being shadowed by a historiographic review, This volume adds yet another dimension. Following the same chap ter scheme, it provides the text of 157 signifi cant documents, for instance 16 on the Ulster crisis, 12 on the war of independence, 10 on the civil war. Well and good, but a random sample?the manifesto on the split between the Irish and the National Volunteers of Sep tember 1914?is taken from and attributed to a secondary source, F. X. Martin's The Irish Volunteers 1913-75 with ellipses possibly made by Martin, and possibly by the present editor, the 'analysis' consists of introductory paragraphs to each document in rather smaller type, setting the context. There's a se lect bibliography, but so select that it doesn't list the book from which that Volunteers doc ument was copied . . . Incidentally this is a sewn paperback. *+ ** * // 'My Darling Danny': letters from Mary O'Connell to her son Daniel, 1830-1832. ed Erin I. Bishop.

HISTORY INDUSTRIAL Memoir of Localities of Minerals of Economic Importance and Metalliferous Mines in Ireland. Grenville A. J. Cole. Mining Heritage Society of Ireland, c/o Geological Survey, Be^ar's Bush, Dublin 4. 195 pp ?9.50 pb 0-^34538-0-4. The main part of this book (155 pages) is a facsimile of tnat published under this title (actually Memoir ana Map of Localities etc.) in 1922 bv the Stationery Office for the Department of Agricultural and Technical In struction as part of the work of the Geological Survey of wnich Cole was the director. It was and is an invaluable gazetteer of workings, even prehistoric ones and those long discon tinued and possibly all but forgotten locally. It was reprinted in 1956, and is here enlarged to include a ten-page biography of the author (1859-1924) by Patrick N. Wyse Jackson, and some 32 illustrations which are mainly photos (remains of buildings, machinery etc.) taken recently, though there are some diagrams of mines. At first glance we assumed these pho tos were from the 1956 edition, so dim and dull are they, but we guess the problem is that no-one but professionals shoots black-and white any more, and colour snaps repro duced in monochrome tend to lack contrast. The map that originally came with the book seemed not worth reprinting, particularly as serious enquirers can now have resort to the new OS 1:50,000 sheets, which identify the townlands mentioned in the text. The pub lisher could and perhaps should have added proper grid references in the margins, those in the text being apparently just sheet numbers of the 1 -inch and 6-inch maps, with occasional disarming indicators in the text like "at the O of Connemara". The newly formed Mining Heritage Society hopes the book will be a help to local historians and may also stimulate and attract new research on mining sites that can be added to the inventory they are now com piling. Not a moment too soon; local memo ries must be dying rapidly. ++ * * // The Millers and the Mills of Ireland of about 1850. William E. Hogg. Author at 3 Gosioorth Park, Dalkey, Co Dublin. 406 pp ?24.50 pb 0-9532246-1-9. Like the list of mines above, this provides invaluable information for the industrial and local historian, but where ear lier editions of the mines book were available in a few libraries, this data has been gathered and printed here for the first time from a num ber of unique sources; and it is also a valuable book for genealogists. By far the biggest source is the 'Mill Books' compiled by ana for the Valuation Office 150 years ago and avail able for all but 11 counties in the National Ar chive. In tabulated form these give barony, parish and townland, miller's name, type of mill (flax, distillery, spade, logwood, bleach ing, tucking, beetling, kiln, spinning, in addi tion to the common corn and grist mills), di mensions of the water wheel, number of millstones, number of months per year and hours per day in use and the consequent valu ation of the power used, the result of a quite complex computation. Like the mines book, unfortunately no attempt is made to locate the mills with map references, but presumably many more of them leave some recognisable remains, and the search (by far the majority are water- driven) is narrowed to water courses, where dams, weirs, millponds and races are likely to leave vestiges. For places where the valuation books are missing, Mr Hogg has tirelessly dug up information from other sources. He might well have got a Heri tage Council grant to help him publish his work if he had sought it, but that Council and its parent state department are notable for their absence from the list of acknowledge ments to libraries, archives and other helping bodies. In a way this may not be a bad thing (unless you find ?24.50 hard to raise) because it means Hogg has been able to exercise the flaithi?lacht of the true obsessive specialist and throw in everything but the kitchen sink in the way of supporting information, illus trations, facsimiles from books on the subject, and side notes of all sorts. A grant-aiding council might well have stipulated the dull, dreary correctness and restraint of the 'pro fessional' historian, and we would have been the poorer. As it is Hogg provides a wealth of material?not always easy to find admit tedly?and throws in indexes of millers and millworkers which is a new and rich source for the genealogist. HISTORY INSTITUTIONAL Like Ministering to Like : the origins and growth of Accord, the marriage counsel ling service in the Catholic Church in Ire land. Philip E. Leonard. Columba Press. 175 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85607-258-4. An exceptionally thor ough and detailed history of what we knew for many years as CMAC, which indeed is as much a history of Irish and Catholic attitudes to marriage Dreakdown from 1945, when CMAC grew out of initiatives in the British forces, and through the changes of attitude and so of strategies that came about with Vati can 2. From the attitude that only the confes sor could intervene in the privacy of mar riage, to acceptance that relationships could be openly discussed and even mended with the help of priests and/or doctors?and fi nally that married people could be of help to each other in this regard and that j$ New Titles from Kestrel Books \ Theirs not to do or die Tony Brehony A rollicking account of the life and times of Supply assistant, Jimmy O'Neill, RN, who in 1939 with other unlikely heroes went down to the sea to help fight the king's enemies.

The book freely draws on an equivalent English history, Fifty Years of Marriage Care by John Marshall, which contained a chapter on the Irish connection. Illustrations (mainly officers and activists, many of whom get separate biographical notes), source notes, bibliography and the texts of various records and documents. There is no index, but the book's plan is clear enough to make this, perhaps, no great loss. ** * #// HISTORY LOCAL The History of Limerick City. Sean Spellissy. Celtic Bookshop, 2 Rutland Street, Limerick. 376pp?25 hb 0-9534683-0-5; ?12.95pb -1-3.. This surely is the ideal level and scope for a local history, though of course there aren't many places of Limerick's size and plenitude or past to warrant such a handsome production. Two features strike one: the wealth of maps, photos, prints, facsimiles, artefacts and what not?on every page there's something to get you by the visual lapels and lure you in?and the breaking of text into pieces of different length as the author con ducts you, as in a gazetteer, from street to building to church, district by district, with anecdotes and 'colour pieces', facts and lore all the way. This after a first chapter that sums up the history of the whole from the earliest days, and ending with a magnificient bibliog raphy (quite browsable rather than strictly for business) and then a practical index. Inci dentally a third immediate impression is av oirdupois: the cased version (we got both!) is n't far off a kilogram, and the paperback barely 100 grams less, which means it's on a classy paper, and incidentally the paperback is sewn, which means its as long lasting (if not more) as the hardback. Good to see a book seller standing in as midwife too. * * * // Lewis' Cork : a topographical dictionary of the parishes, towns and villages of Cork city and county. Collins Press. 453 pp ?15.99 pb 1-898256-57-8.. The sections pertaining to Cork from what was really a publishing pot boiler at the time of its first publication in 1837, but of course its notes on who lived in which big house, valuations, local ruins and general lore has gained value with age, and is particularly important because it describes places (not unfortunately the social scene be low a certain level) just before the famine struck. This is a resetting of the text, not a fac simile. ** * * / In SligO Long Ago: aspects of town and county over two centuries. John C. McTernan. Avena Publications, Sligo. 632 pp NPG pb 0-9520594-6-0. A marvellous collec tion of articles on every conceivable aspect of Sligo life over the past two hundred and more years, from all sorts of sources (among which newspapers are most prominent), with illus trations of every sort, including facsimiles of documents ana old advertisements, the text of documents and contemporary reports. Totally unpretentious, and devoted to enter taining and as well as informing, this is the sort of local history that is readable by just about anyone?and inviting to everyone? and so does much more to inform and sharpen up local lore than many a heavier and more 'professional' tome. It is a companion to an earlier volume, Olde Sligoe, and is a sewn paperback (i.e. it's not going to fall to bits), with a handsome cover design. ++ * Stone and Tree Sheltering Water: an exploration of sacred and secular wells in County Louth. Susan Connolly and Anne-Marie Moroney. Flax Mill Publications, 34 Ballyvark, Flax Mill Lane, Drogheda. 96 pp + 16 of colour photos. ?8.99 pb 0-9533822-0-6. A very thorough and in teresting?and un usual?study of a fea countryside to which is attached so much lore dating from heaven knows how long ago. Susan Con nolly's contribution is poetry ('Well Fever'), and Anne-Marie Moroney's (she was a Swiss Miss from St Gallen before she met Mr Moroney; where maybe she inherited something hibernian from our medieval connections) is the topographic and folk loric research. The colour photos were well worth while, even if they added two or three pounds to the orice. and ture the there's a glossary, bibliography, maps and an index. Book was grant- aided by the Heritage Council. ++ * * / HISTORY POPULAR Brother against Brother. Liam Deasy. Mercier Press. 126 pp ?6.99 pb 1-85635-266-8. Reissue of a classic account of the civil war as seen by a republican who had a hand in the death of his friend Michael Collins at Beal na mBl?th, and who finally issued the order which brought hostilities to a close and thus saved many lives. He was the author also of Towards Ireland Free about the war of inde pendence. + * # / The Great Shame: the story of the Irish in the old world and the new. Thomas Keneally. Chat to &amp; Windus. 752pp + 32 of pho tos. Stg?25 hb 1-85619-788-3. The Australian author of Schindlers List traces his and his wife's Irish forebears back to the times of transportation and famine and brings his very considerable skills as researcher, synthesist and writer to a blockbuster of a book on the Australian experience of the Irish convicts and others. His illustrations sections add a good dimension. His contemporary sources list in the bibliography is remarkable, and we've no doubt many a professional historian could not have done so well even just in terms of donkey-work and selection, much less readability. // When the Normans Came to Ire land. Maurice Sheehy. Mercier Press. 156 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85635-267-6. We certainly don't mean to belittle the learning of the late profes sor of palaeography and late Latin by label ling it popular' but to encourage those like us without pretensions to scholarship to read this plain and most interesting account. It is not many experts in their field who can write so straight and simply on their subject, and we found our ignorance of the events of the twelfth century that still resound about us at the end of the twentieth was profound. There's an appendix on origins of tne primacy controversy (the arch-see of Armagh and ail that) and a few source notes that can be safely ignored, leaving a real reader's book. Sheehy wrote it in the seventies, and died in 1991, not long after its first appearance. ++ * / LETTERS No Author Better Served : the corre spondence of Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider, ed. Maurice Harmon. Harvard University Press. 508 pp $35 / ?24.35 hb 0-674-62522-6. This handsome volume has reached us with a Bray bookseller's price sticker, so the IR?24.35 above is putative. We have a vague memory of some correspon dence about it, which might have been a clue to cisatlantic distributor, but our desk is in its usual state of primordial chaos. Schneider was the main producer of Beckett's plays in the USA. The correspondence (1955 to 1984 when Schneider was killed crossing a street to mail a letter to Beckett) is therefore practical? vitally important to both men?and exhibits Beckett's interesting combination of fastidi ous concern for detail of interpretation with humorous resignation, as well as the friendly relationship between the two. Explanatory notes for most letters, and an index. * / NATURE Ireland : a natural history. David Cabot. Harper Collins. 512 pp + 8 of colour pho tos. Stg?17.99 pb 0-00-220080-5; (Stg?34.99 hb -20079-1) New Naturalist series. A remarkable achievement for one man: an encyclopaedic account in one volume of the manifestations of non-human life on this island and sufficient of its physical contexts (geography, geology, weather). The account is interdisciplinary and ordered by types of habitat: mountain, bog, lakes and rivers, the Burren, turloughs, wood land, farmland, coastline, islands and the sea. Introducing all is a history of natural history less concerned with literature and more witn science than John Wilson Foster's recent Na ture in Ireland, and then a separate chapter of 'biological history'. At the rear end is a chap ter on conservation issues. There is an excel lent index, but what is labelled 'bibliography' is in fact a list of source notes ordered by the references to them from the text, and so diffi cult to scan, though in fact they are so legibly laid out (and so systematically, owing to Cabot's self-discipline in not straying from his subject-scheme) that no researcher will be thwarted for long. There are lists of the statu tory nature reserves in the Republic and the North, giving rough position (no grid refer ences) area in hectares and very brief descrip tion. The index acts as a list or species. Some idea of the scope (and inconsistency and lack of concession to the non-expert) may be got by noting that the 'three commonest' mosses foundin sand dunes are named in Latin and indexed but nowhere described, and the same is true of the moss that is found only in the dunes at Magilligan, Co Derry?but none of these four mosses is contained in a list of the 'notable' mosses of Ireland reproduced (for some inscrutable reason only with ferns and liverworts: no other species or genera get such a list) in an appendix, and yet none of these 'notable' ones is itself indexed.

Blackstaff Press. 352 pp StgCH.99 pb O-8;ib40-654-b. "We appreciate that you gave the hardback very good coverage/''says the publisher, which is odd because we gave it the usual tree 'shopping-list' entry but didn't re ceive a review copy. Needham was the Con servative MP who served in Northern Ireland from 1985 to 1992 and showed that Tory min isters aren't all stuffed shirts. Against tough odds he got things done, intolerant of caution and red tape. He is was who remarked to his wife on the phone that it was time the cow re signed, apparently using this as a euphemism for prime minister Thatcher; this got recorded by hands unknown and published bv a Sunday rag?and Needham survived, f-iis memoirs and analysis of the Northern situa tion look excellent. + * * Brits Speak Out : British soldiers' im pressions of the Northern Ireland conflict. ed. John Lindsay. Guildhall Press. 158 pp St$?8.95 pb 24 x 18 cm 0-946451-51-6. This should have been recorded last month but we mislaid it. This was partly because it was so fascinating. Lindsay wrote to fifty local news papers and magazines in Britain seeking the reminiscences of those who had served as sol diers in Ireland since 1969. He explicitly said that the resulting book should not be propa ganda for anyone but that he hoped it would contribute to building a greater understand ing between people who had been involved in the conflict. Those who responded clearly did so because of a desire to describe their experi ences and/or express their feelings; many of them are far from sympathetic with the na tionalists. Some of the stories were the result of telephone interviews or correspondence; those who could not contribute that way re ceived a questionnaire, which was carefully open?not leading or 'loaded' in any way. Fourteen accounts are given, four of them from people serving life sentences in prisons, one from a man who is actively campaigning against the British military presence in Ire land. They impress the reader with their gen uineness: the editor has clearly done a very good and professional job, and the result is compellingly readable. Yes, it is depressing, frightening, uplifting and the rest, but mostly the harvest with us was pathos. There are some good photographs that help to set the scene, a list of abbreviations, bibliography and index. Among the ruck of books on the troubles, this is important as it is undeniably primary evidence, and from a sort of witness that seldom testifies. The cover is an interest ing example of an excellent idea ('Brits out' scrawled on a wall, with 'speak' superim posed between the two words) nearly spoiled by the designer setting 'speak' in a stencil typeface decorated to look like either cut-out pieces of a union jack or a stencil through which the flag is visible?both quite meaning less visual tricks which vitiate what would be a much more striking image. It's a case for the old KISS mnemonic: "Keep it simple, stupid!" Cultural Traditions in Northern Ire land : cultural diversity in contemporary Europe, ed. Maurna Crozier and Richard Froggatt. Institute of Irish Studies. 157 pp Stg?7.50 pb 0-85389-720-4. The fifth in a series of the proceedings of the Cultural Traditions Group conferences. There were three annual meetings 1989-91 on Irishness, Britishness and Europeanness respectively, then a long gap before a relatively recent one on Varieties of Scottisliness and this which has 22 papers which struck us (terrible cynics about culture who tend like Goebbels to reach for our re volvers) as mostly practical, realistic and in teresting, perhaps because they're mostly by people who are not just academic. They are Detter characterised by the subtitle than by the main title. Ben Allen's cover painting is colourful, apt and decorative; Basil R?k?czy's 'Chez les Sinclairs' is pleasant enough in monochrome, but three reproductions of it are two too many! *+ * * // NOVELS The Brewery. Mark Grantham. Dobbin &amp; O'Dowd. 350 pp ?8.95 pb 0-9534815-0-6. Stop! Look! Hear this! A first novel from a hitherto unknown publisher, but you can't read the first page without knowing that you're in the hands of a fully professional writer and one with a real story to tell. And you'd be right: Grantham is a New York boy who studied at Trinity College Dublin and created and wrote The Kennedys of Castleross among other radio serials, moving on to London and Paris where he wrote nearly a hundred TV scripts and worked for a news agency. He knows how to grab you and keep you reading, and he does so. Dobbin &amp; O'Dowd seem to know exactly what they're doing too: it's a handsome pro duction, also a hundred per cent professional, temptingly priced and with a good cover de sign by Ken Drakeford. It's about Hungarian and Irish families in Brooklyn in 194/, and murder?or is it? ** // In the Name of the Wolf. John F. Deane. Blackstaff Press. 176 pp Stg?8.99 pb 0-85640-640-6. Last year's winner of the O'Shaughnessy prize for Irish poetry, with his thira novel wnich, like his last, Plightlines, goes back to world war 2 days in the yVest of Ireland with a tale that indeed might have been written in those days. He is an intense writer and lyrical. The distorted and textured cover photograph we borrowed for our own cover last month. *+ a / Passion Play. Conal Creedon. Poolbeg. 288 pv ?6.99 pb 1-85371-698-7. First novel from the Cork man who notched up nearly 500 epi sodes of a radio pseudo-soap-opera Under the Goldie Fish on Rt? and published a collection of determinedly funny short stories, Pancho and Lefty Ride Out, in 1995. Clearly he would like us to call him Cork's Roddy Doyle, and he may be just that for all we know. We are very conservative, but can stand a good deal of fucks and shits these days, and a certain amount of dialect phonetics, but what we can't stand is meaningless phonetics like boi for boy or Jeezus for you know who. Surely these words sound the same in conventional spelling, so what is gained? The cover is amusing and 'now' and will sell hundreds of copies.* a % * / When the Acacia Bird Sings. James O'Halloran. Columba Press. 108 pp ?6.99 pb 1-85607-254-1. It's odd how few priests figure in the writers' honours list apart from work connected with their vocations: a few poets, yes, but hardly any fiction writers we can think of, unless there are some who hide their calling from readers. O'Halloran, a Salesian with tnirty years' work in Africa and South America behind him, has published a number of short stories and here is a first novel, about a family of Tsonga people in Mozambique who, threatened by political terrorism by the RENAMO rebels in the eighties, are forced to migrate into South Africa: an epic journey across the Kruger Park. No doubt it is based on realities, and no doubt at all it is written with deep affection and understanding for a people with whom, it seems, the Irish reader will find it easy to empathise. Enterprising and certainly not run-of-the-mill, with a pleasant and evocative cover. *+ *-* # // PHOTOGRAPHS Sacred Moments. Valerie O'Sullivan. Veritas. 159 pp ?14.99 pb 26 x 20 cm 185390-339-6. A lovely collection of black-and-white photographs of nuns, monks, pilgrims, priests, artists, craftsmen, children and parishioners in moments of their daily life either directly concerned with faith and worship or implying recollection and prayer-in-doing. Designer Bill Bolder put the pages together, mcluaing two on himself and nis work, using computer technology, which we felt lent dignity to our own plying of key board and mouse. The short caption pieces help make or expand on the pictures' visual points. This may all sound sanctimonious or solemn, but in fact it is a quiet book, both seri ous and good humoured but not over-earnest, and above all it projects its qui etness on the reader. In such context it is easier to see the face of God in human faces. The cover we thought didn't come up to the stan dard of the rest. **-*&gt;*#// POETRY Domestic Flight. James Ellis.

Like anyone who tempts the fates by starting a sen tence "Suffice to say," he rambles on for an other eight pages. Notes? Yes, for instance 'Pablo Neruaa's Poppies' needs a note about 2Vi times longer than the poem, apparently in dicating that it was written by Ellis in Spanish ("of which I have only a tourist's grasp') with the help of an Argentinian restaurateur and a dictionary. If the English translation is only "a pale shadow of the Spanish," why weren't we given the Spanish too? At least it wouldn't ave contained a misprint as the English ver sion does, with that dictionary at hand. Where does Neruda come in, and where does the cut of the sleeves go out? (You'll see what we mean). All this sounds ungracious and grudging, but in fact this is a sparkling, ac complished, very variegated and mteresting collection, and unusual in showing how an actor's linguistic talents can be harnessed to quite a different vehicle?and that actors are not necessarily interpretive creatures only? though there are a lot of translations here, from different languages. *+ # // Greetings to our Friends in Brazil: one hundred poems. Paul EHircan. Harvill. 269 pp Stg?14.99/$23.00 hb 1-86046-607-9. This is his seventeenth collection and as the subtitle tells you it is a generous one at 16V? Irish pence (or 21 eurocents) per poem. We find him always unexpected, often scathing, often loving, oc casionally incomprehensible (which we al ways count our loss) never gratuitously any thing, but deadly in earnest, deadly accurate. The allusions as well as the language are often of today and might be lost tomorrow, so there is the question whether he'll last. He is devas tating (because devastated) on Omagh, pro Mary Robinson, devastating again about an American poetical camp-follower, dropping names ... like a rabbit on a rampage: "Saw Simmons last week in NY. How's Carson?" and he's rightly thankful for Lar Cassidy, the Arts Council literature officer we were lucky to have.

Adrian Graffy. Columba Press. 192 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85607-253-3. No, not about old age or senior citizenship unless you're talking about ancient scripture. This seems to be a synopsised retelling with a good deal of expli cation and comment on Hebrew translation puzzles on the way. Conspectus is perhaps the word, and as with all commentaries there's the danger that the reader will think the commentary enough and not bother with anything more than the well-read passages, the key prophecies, the psalms and the odd proverb. What curious titles authors do choose! ++ * * / Commemorating Saints and others of the Irish Church.George Otto Simms. Columba Press. 71 pp ?3.99 pb 15 x 11 cm 1-85607-259-2. Short pieces on some 47 saints and patrons, with prayers supplied by Brian Mayne. A pretty little pocket-sized book, but we re sorry to note that it doesn't record new or recent holy heroes?we couldn't find any one less than 900 years dead. +* * * / From the Inside : a priest's view of the Catholic Church. Tony Flannery. Mercier Press. 189 pp ?7.99 pb 1-85635-244-7. A Redemptorist preacher and retreat giver writes plainly, critically and honestly of the institution in which he has spent his life. As so many readers might, we went for sample to the 'Sex and celibac/ chapter and found such an honest account of Flannery's boyhood ex periences (including abuse by an adult) that we can without hesitation recommend all the other chapters: puzzled, unsure, very human, he seems to have always been a bit of a rebel, but he has a sense of adventure and mission which he communicates well and which dom inates the book. SOCIOLOGY Behind the Silhouettes: exploring the myths of child sexual abuse. Olive Travers. Blackstaff Press. 168 pp Stg?10.99 pb 0-85640-634-1. This is a calm, thoughtful, knowledgeable book about what is widely seen as the most important social-psychologi cal problem facing us. The public perception of sexual abusers of children or 'paedophiles' (properly pederasts, for isn't a love of chil dren an important part of being human?) is of totally evil monsters, to be kept away from or dinary society if possible for ever, and this strong reaction is ted and encouraged by me dia which are simultaneously pandering to a prurient voyeurism, free as they have never keen before to publish descriptions of obscene behaviour. Travers makes the case for psy chological treatment rather than punishment, while stipulating that full responsibility must be accepted by the offender. She does not hes itate to show our collective responsibility as well. She is strong on the law's insouciant atti tude to victims, but we have not yet had time to read deeply enough to see if she can recon cile the victim's neea (for such it frequently is) for the abuser to be seen to be reviled, put away and punished with the essential use lessness (or worse) of imprisonment. One would hope that many more people than psy chologists, psychiatrists, lawyers and such would read this sane book as an antidote to emotive and knee-jerk journalism. * + -* # / SPIRIT Insight Meditation.: the practice of free dom/Joseph Goldstein.

Here he answers all the com mon problems of those embarking on medita tion. Dipping, one can understand why his books are popular: he has the knack of con veying joy in selflessness. Whether he merits the 'classic' of one of the puffs is another mat ter. Silenced by Prayer: from words to con templation. Peter Ward. Columba. 153 pp ?7.99 pb 0-85607-252-5. A Redemptorist priest re lates his own experience of the finding and developing of contemplation, from the set words into the silences of the prayer of sim plicity. He uses, as he did himself, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and others to light the way. The element of personal memoir is bound to bring this to life and greater mean ing. ++ # Spirituality for the 21st Century : Christian living in a secular age. Pat Collins. Columba. 218 pp ?9.99 pb 0-85607-257-6. This, according to the blurb "maintains that many of today's Christians' conflicts whether insti tutional, ethical or theological are rooted in spirituality". If this is so, Vincentian Collins is certainly up against a massive and growing counter-opinion among both Catholics and Protestants: that almost all the conflicts are secular in nature, origin and insignificance if we may so describe the Churches organic and institutional.

Account of the sinking of the Holyhead-Kingstown mailboat by a U-boat's torpedos on 10 October 1918, when some five hundred passengers and crew died and about 270 survived. The author is a 'sport diver' who became interested in the sinking from his diving adventures (the ship lies in about 100 feet of water only a few miles from Dublin). As an amateur historian he has collected a remarkable amount of back fround on shipping, the war at sea, the U oats and the Irish conscription question (how many army personnel were aboard was hushed up, so that British propaganda could make the most of the sinking of a 'non-combatant' vessel). He is not a born writer, nor does he get quite right the allow ances for emotion and opinion that a historian may draw on. Charts, photos and facsimile documents are well used. However the book is designed by a lady who says she provides 'Virtually Perfect Editing Services', thus showing hubris that almost demands the sort of pratfall we'd inevitably make if we called this column 'Fault-Free First Flush'. She has taken upon herself to change the set width (or 'tracking' as computer-speak now calls the spacing of the characters) of Stanley Morison's useful if overused typeface Times New Rom an - -bri 11 i an 11 y de signed to be economical of space to give it a staccato and not very pleasant or legible appearance, like this. She is also an adherent of the school of book design that feels that if you have to rotate the book 90 degrees anti-clockwise to look at a picture on a verso, then logic dictates that you should have to rotate it the same amount in the other direction to look at one on a recto. Where such illustrations occupy facing pages (as on page 90 and 91) the ridiculous result is adjacent pic tures demanding a 180-degree turn. Why not have the typesetting upside-down on every second page and wring the poor reader's neck more consistently? Finally, when the book was all but finished, the author came across an interview recorded in 1979 with the Leins ter's assistant purser, Bill Sweeney, then aged about 83. It is an invaluable first-hand ac count, and Stokes' reasons for not reproduc ing it in full or rewriting passages to accom modate its evidence ("It might have been said that these recollections were inaccurate," where in the next line he acknowledges that they are 'extremely' accurate) are not terribly convincing. And he manages to misquote Tennyson in his dedication..! ++</page><page sequence="6">7? March /ooo books Ireland NEW FROM THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY Irish Historic Towns Atlas No. 9 BRAY K. M.

New series from a new publisher, each with a not inconsiderable text and forty-plus period photographs with the occa sional cartoon or facsimile advertisement. The majority of the material is drawn from the Guinness Segrave library and archive of the Royal Irish Automobile Club, which is not open to the public. Some of the earlier mate rial (1896-1906) has already been well used by the same author in An Irish Roadside Camera (Marino, ?25) which we reviewed?rather late unfortunately?last December. Such slim books at ?4.50 seem poor value at first sight, but page for page and size for size they are in fact directly comparable in value with the Ma rino book."However Dreoilin make a mistake that will no doubt be very common in the next two years: they label the booklets with a dif ferent price in Euros??4.50 is 5.71, and don't let any bookseller charge you 5.75 in stead! Such rounding-up profiteering was common when we changed to decimal cur rency but is not acceptable this time beyond the nearest penny or cent. Leslie Porter, a Donegal man, is introduced as something of a hero in pre-WWl motor racing. He joined the Royal Flying Corps and died on a reconnais sance flight in France in 1916. As to the apos trophe in 'Grand's Prix', we assume it's meant to indicate a plural. The early days of the mo tor car have a fascination which (if steam train strongly entrenched as time goes on. What is perhaps surprising is how little these books enth ;uide) will become more concern themselves with mechanical details. We wonder if this is because automobile tech nology has changed in a century much less than say that of ships, aircraft or trains?

Colourpoint Books. 72 pp StgC13.99 hb 30 x 20 cm 1-898392-42-0. Did you know the superheated Blanche, Lydia or Alice? Born in 1912 and renamed in 1928, they weighed fifty tons apiece and (since ladies should not be compared with horses) we must record their tractive effort as 14,294.8 pounds as they trundled their scarlet trains around Donegal. When her sisters were sold for scrap in 1961, Blanche (n?e Strabane) somehow survived and is now in comfortable retirement at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, we hope still in her brilliant reef liv ery. This book on their last active days is full of colour photos of summer days in fifties Donegal, borne of the places are preserved, too?we were sadly admiring Kulygordon station (next stop Stranorlar, where until 1947 you could change to the Glenties branch line, 2 miles of which has now been restored, with 3-foot gauge track) with its humpy bridge and cottage with flower beds on the platform fringed with whited stones (reminiscent of the old barracks motto "If it moves, salute it; if it doesn't, whitewash it"), but our tears disap peared when we noticed that "station and bridge are still there today". Railway enthusi asts will delight in this, out it's too good for them alone: it belongs to all our pasts. +* -* ** // Trams to the Hill of Howth: a photo graphic tribute. James Kilroy.

We revelled in the caption about the identities of some passengers who had been recognised by someone in an earlier publication: "Some times/' the editor remarks, "the people in the photographs are more important than the ac tual subject itself."
