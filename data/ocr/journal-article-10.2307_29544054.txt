<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture by Joseph Rykwert MIT Press, 1996 598 PP-&gt; ?49-95 0-262-18170-3 Oswyn Murray What is signified by the column in classical architecture? This question has puzzled writers on architecture since the time of ancient Greece. Clearly it is a question with many answers. We may talk about it in terms of origins: we may trace the classical column back to the columniated buildings of ancient Egypt, the Near East, or Minoan Crete - for it is true that in some senses the classical Greek column originated in earlier civilizations. The use of the vegetal or palm-leaf capital in ancient Egypt, for example, has obvious parallels in the de? velopment of the Corinthian capital. But there are also dis? continuities. The Minoans set their columns 'upside-down', with the taper towards the base. It is hard to credit scholars who believe that there was a practical reason for this - to prevent wooden columns from 'rooting'. Is it just a historically conditioned response that makes this inver? sion of the natural seem aestheti? cally unacceptable to us? And if the upward tapering column seems more 'natural', because we are conditioned by our obser? vation of trees, did the Minoans reject this analogy? Was their practice perhaps intended to represent the triumph of culture over nature? Is there, then, a functional pur? pose to columns? Twin columns were often used at the entrance to important ancient buildings to create a formal sheltered porch. Other buildings had a row of columns along the sides, pre? sumably to support the thatched roof beyond the wall, and thus to channel water away from the vulnerable mud bricks resting on a 'damp-proof stone foundation. But how did such a technical solution become ossified, to sur? vive first in wood and terracotta buildings and then in stone, none of which has a functional need for the column? Does the decoration of co? lumns also relate to earlier models or to earlier materials? Did the capital originate in an architectural feature derived from wood construction? Is its leafy summit an allusion to the previous life of the material, or is it simply ornamental? Does the fluting on columns imitate tree bark or wood graining or pri? mitive chiselled decoration? If so, why are the earliest versions of classical Greek columns devoid of vegetal features? Vitruvius claimed that almost all the dis? tinctive features of classical archi? tecture could be traced back to the carpentry of wooden build? ings, thus implying a singular failure on the part of the Greeks to appreciate the qualities of stone. What do such vestigial sur? vivals of original forms or ma? terials mean centuries later? We talk as if the discovery of the 96 AA FILES 33</page><page sequence="2">original use of the column might reveal something which is intrin? sic to all subsequent uses. Per? haps it would: in almost mystic terms Demetri Porphyrios, for instance, puts forward the idea (which Rykwert shows to have already been formulated by the Abbe Laugier in the eighteenth century) of the creation of 'tec? tonic fiction out of the construc? tional necessities of building'. All building alludes to the earliest of functions and materials, and the tradition of architecture repre? sents the continuum of the spirit of Homo faber, or 'construction man'. But columns are also symbolic, by virtue of the history of their application in architecture. The classical column was initially used in temple building, and later to denote monumental or public buildings. This latter function has survived to the present day, with columns used to distinguish banks and government offices, or the extension to the National Gallery in London. Thus, col? umns long ago lost the need even to appear to perform a function, and can simply be applied as sur? face decoration, like pin-stripes on trousers, to proclaim the importance of the wearer. The contradictions of such symbolism were, however, re? vealed at the Classical Archi? tecture League conference in Chicago in 1995, where a funda? mental difference between Euro? pean and American uses of the column became apparent. To the Americans the column is a symbol of independence and democracy: the triumph of neo classicism ensured that the young republic proclaimed its freedom and its adherence to the Con? stitution in columniated buildings across a continent. But to the European eye columns are more sinister - symbolic of ancien regime and of the bloody revolution that overthrew it. In this century the use of the column has in par? ticular been associated with totalitarianism, from Mussolini and Hitler to Stalin and Ceau sescu, and thus in Europe the column is perceived as essentially anti-democratic. One of the more unexpected features of a confer? ence that had come together in effect to celebrate the column was the struggle of architects from both sides of the Atlantic to find common ground by subsum? ing some part of their inherited symbolic logic. Columns do indeed have negative aspects, especially when divorced from any building function. The triumphal column began - with some justification - as an enormous replica in stone of the ancient book scroll, pulled out to reveal its contents, a kind of cartoon strip recounting the story of a war. Trajan intended his column to be 'read' by tourists circling the galleries of his library, in whose courtyard it stood. Late antiquity set a fashion for triumphal columns decorated with inscriptions and topped by statues, perhaps because the dynasts ofthat age no longer had the skill or the resources to erect fully columniated buildings. In the fourth century AD, in a travesty of this practice, Christian holy men sat on top of columns all over Syria. This can in part be understood as a visible sign of the triumph of Christianity over the ruins of the ancient temples, and in part as a mortification of the flesh, since columns were not made for comfortable living, and the Devil might tempt the holy ? man to fall asleep and so knock him off his perch. Even more dreadfully, Rykwert records a proposal by Adolf Loos in 1922 to build in Chicago 'the most beautiful and distinctive office building in the world', a thirty two-storey Doric column; fortun? ately it was never built, for it is monstrous and would have been singularly ill-adapted to its pur? pose. The phallic overtones of co lumniated architecture are now seen by many to signify male dominance in the public sphere, while the curved arch is sugges? tive of a more private and female world. Mythic origins, symbolic his? tory, inherited function - in all its aspects the column lends itself to metaphor, whether as structural element or as decoration; and this may of course be part of the secret of its continuing presence in European architecture. Joseph Rykwert's monumental new work, The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture, in spite of its erudition, its wealth of ideas and its marvellous collection of new photographs (many taken by the author himself), is not so much a history of all interpretations of the column, as an investigation of a particular interpretation - one which he would claim to be both dominant and (if I understand him correctly) in some sense essential, not just to the meaning ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Faces on entablatures, from Diego de Sagredo's Medidas del Romano (Toledo, 1526).

(Museo Lapidario, Modena) Drawing by Mariano Tacola from his Liber de Ingeneis, written in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. The inscription reads, 'He from whom nothing is hidden created me. And I have all measure with me, both of what is heavenly above as well as earthly and infernal. And who understands himself understands much. He has the book of angels and of nature hidden in his mind. And below, etc.' (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich) of the column, but to the moral significance of all architecture. His argument begins from an observation first formulated by Vitruvius in his discussion of the classical orders, in which he claims that the proportional relations of the classical temple are derived from the proportions of the human body. Vitruvius relates this argument to the orders: Doric is associated with the male, Ionic with the female, and Corinthian with the virginal; or (as John Shute portrayed it in 1563) the three orders are per? sonified by Hercules, Juno and Venus, respectively. In the core of his book (Chapters VII-XI) Rykwert patiently and percept? ively traces the history of this anthropomorphic argument in relation to the four orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Tuscan), which often involved taking liter? ally the presence of caryatids and giants as bearers of architectural weight, from buildings to title pages. Why would people have been substituted for columns, un? less columns were thought of as people? Is it sexism that makes us feel more comfortable with the grim Adantes of the great temple of Zeus at Agrigento than with the caryatids of the Athenian Acropolis: or are such bearers of weight symbolic of the oppressed peoples of the ancient Greek city - the Carthaginian war-slaves who built the temples of Agri? gento, and the women who lacked political rights in a democ? racy? Yet, if the Atlantes of Agri? gento appear deliberately to strain under their load, 'there is nothing browbeaten or slavish about. . . the Athenian korai; on the contrary, to the naive, un instructed eye, these last look serene and poised, sandaled and walking - almost dancing - with a light step' (p. 133). The refinement of this meta? phor fascinated theoreticians of architecture from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, when (as Rykwert shows) the theory of the orders was really invented; Bernini for instance claimed that all proportion derived from Adam's body, and was made by God's own hand in His image, and 'the variety of the orders arose from the difference be? tween man's body and woman's - because of the differing pro? portions of each'. Rykwert shows how this widely held doctrine even pressed into service the study of physiognomies in order to demonstrate that the profiles of the various capitals reflected the proportions of the human face. The most complete of these treatises is the late fifteenth century manuscript Trattato di Architettura, Ingegneria e Arte Milit?re, by Francesco di Giorgio Martini, which uses the human figure as a basis for establishing all aspects of architecture, from the propor? tions of capitals, to the correct elevation in church architecture, to the principles of city planning. But, as Rykwert shows, the metaphor of the human body was not confined to architecture, for it was believed that the universe itself had been made in God's image, and was therefore struc? tured in accordance with the proportions of humankind. The heavens and the signs of the zodiac were often inscribed with? in a representation of the human body, which was seen as a micro? cosm of the seasons, the humours and the planets. Thus for 1,500 years man was the measure of all things, from musical harmony to the nature of the divine itself. As a metaphor this lies at the heart of the ordering of experience within the classical tradition, and in turn explains why architecture - religious architecture in parti? cular - can be seen as a metaphor for the human condition, em? bodying all beliefs and all acts and rituals, whether relating to the worship of gods or to death and after-life. Thus the metaphor of the column as body relates to that of the building as body, and that of the city as body politic, giving rise in each case to the canons of pro? portion. These for Rykwert, no less than for Vitruvius, express the natural dimensions of archi? tecture, for truly humanistic architecture reflects the propor? tions of the human beings who created it, and the anthropo? morphic gods whom it cele? brated. Architecture and the girl hidden within the dancing column prove to be only a small part of a far more wide-ranging theme within the book - the his? tory of anthropomorphism itself, the story of how man has struc? tured the universe in accordance with the human form. For Rykwert this vision of man at the centre of the universe is not merely a historical phenomenon, but the ultimate and true mess? age of humanism: man is the measure of all things; and the practical consequence for archi? tecture in the modern world is not necessarily an inert classicism as style, but rather a constant attention to the concept of pro? portion contained within the metaphoric image of the human form. So the column is not merely a decorative motif or a sign of order, nor symbolic of an attachment to tradition, but an expression of humanism in archi 98 AA FILES 33</page><page sequence="4">tecture. Indeed, modern architec? ture could dispense with columns entirely, as long as its creations retain the mathematics and the spirit of anthropomorphism. Rykwert has written a book of fundamental importance, which is both a historical re-creation of the world of human order that disappeared with the discovery of the autonomy of nature in the nineteenth century, and a triumph of mystic humanism worthy of the Renaissance itself.
