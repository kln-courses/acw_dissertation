The matter is comprised in the following chapters:--(I) the study of the Bible; (2) allegorical exegesis; (3) anthropomorphic expressions in the Bible; (4) the different rules of exegesis; (5) the exegesis of the Midrashim; (6) that of the Targums; (7) explanation of words, viz. the synonyms, homonyms and metaphors, verbs and their derivatives, &amp;c.; (8) the names of God; (9) angels; (Io) prophecy and the prophets; (II) the theory of visions; (I2) miracles, the revelation on Sinai; (I3) Divine providence, free-will; (I4) the biblical commandments, and the reasons for them; (I5) the biblical narratives; (I6) on Gen. i; (I7) on Ezek. i; (I8) on the book of Job; (I9) explanation of special passages of the Bible; (20) the Hebrew language, and the language of the Mishna; (21) sources of Maimonides' philology and exegesis, supposed exegetical writings by him. The last two chapters are the sections which will be most useful to students of the Hebrew language. The reference to other exegetes and grammarians is exhaustive, and very valuable for those interested in Jewish theology as it appears in the Bible. The style is clear and concise, a rare talent possessed by Prof. Bacher. The subject is thoroughly treated and, I believe, in a lasting manner, so that this study of Maimonides will remain for generations. Prof. Bacher has now supplied the preface to the Dalalat, which Munk intended to write if he had lived out his time. I congratulate the author on having satisfied a want. HEBREW WRITINGS IN AMERICA. I. RABBINIC literature was transplanted to America by my lamented friend, Dr. A. Kohut. Besides his own monographs on Yemen MSS. (see J. Q. B., III, p. 620, and V, pp. 338 sqq.), he stimulated Dr. Mar- golis to follow him (J. Q. R., V, pp. 340 sqq.). I am happy to state that the tradition will continue, and, curious to say, even American immigrants are carrying on the practice of writing in Hebrew. The following monographs reached me by the kindness of the authors :-(a) Concerning the biography of Leon (Judah) Modena, by Nehemiah Samuel Libowitz, with the title of rVII, i'"rN ,m'1', i5 121 r nlt'1: (Wien, I896); (b) additional notes by the well-known M. Friedmann, by Judge Sulzberger in Philadelphia; (c) by Dr. H. Brody, Berlin, edited by the author of (a), Newark, New York. 2. The well-known traveller, E. Deinard, issued a catalogue of MSS. and books in the possession of Judge M. Sulzberger, mentioned above (Newark, 1896). No. 9 of the MSS. is the 11t Vn10, of which it is not yet certain if it is another redaction of the 5rl n TD. 74I</page></plain_text>
