<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANCESTORS, TRICKSTERS AND DEMONS: AN EXAMINATION OF CHIMBU INTERACTION WITH THE INVISIBLE WORLD1 JENNY HUGHES Deakin University The fundamental premiss of Gods, Ghosts and Men in Melanesia (Lawrence and Meggitt 1965) was that the epistemology of people of the Seaboard of Papua New Guinea was more dominated by religion than was that of the Highlanders. Among the latter, the Chimbu have commonly been portrayed as supreme pragmatists. However, they believe in a complex and variegated spirit-world, described in some detail in this paper. INTRODUCTION In 1965 Lawrence and Meggit published a collection of papers on the nature of Melanesian spirituality by a number of ethnographers who had worked in Papua New Guinea and other parts of Melanesia in the post-War period. The well-known premiss upon which Gods, Ghosts and Men in Melanesia is based, namely that Seaboard or Coastal people's epistemology was more dominated by religion than was that of the Highlanders, provided a baseline from which much subsequent argument and research has sprung. The proposition was based on a number of ethnographic studies from throughout Melanesia and led the editors to draw the conclusion that ritual and cosmological speculation might be of greater significance on the Coast than in the Highlands. Later work has shown however, that this distinction is less clear-cut than had been first thought. This is to be expected as later ethnographers have earlier experiences on which to draw and may be assumed to be in a better position to make assumptions. Among Highlanders, the Chimbu have been commonly portrayed as the supreme pragmatista living in the present '... rarely thinking of the past or seriously preparing for the future' (Brown 1973:8). This image of Chimbu clansmen and women is not relevant to the 1980s, however much it may have seemed so in the 1960s when the present must have appeared much more exciting than the past. The reality of a spirit world which co-exists with Chimbu human beings is not doubted by village people who are ever mindful of their obligations. Among educated people a consensus also exists that the intrusion of outsiders who have brought their own spirits, has not significantly diminished the reality of the Chimbu spiritual world. The name Chimbu or Simbu is frequently used to refer to the 178,000 people who inhabit Chimbu Province (1980 National Census). Others apply the term more precisely to include only the Kuman speakers (Nilles 1950:25). My discussion includes Oceania, 59, 1988 59</page><page sequence="2">Demons and Tricksters all Kuman speakers and those who speak related dialects. Their numbers extend to over 100,000 and they are found in the north, central, west and south-central parts of the province. The Chimbu are a patrilineal people but they maintain great flexibility in their social system which allows for the inclusion of sons-in-law and occasionally clients of big men within the subclan. The tribe is the largest recognised territorial grouping but in daily life relationships seldom extend beyond the sub-clan which includes up to several hundred individuals who look back to a common ancestor. The plethora of spirits which Nilles2 indicated existed at the time of contact, have not diminished in number or importance under the impact of Christianity and more secular forms of modernisation. It is my contention that the continuing significance of the spirits in the 1980s is indicative of the enduring need for continuity and community in an environment in which unpredictability has become the norm. Ancestors are important because of the links to the past which they represent, demons are a useful sanction to beware of certain places and situations and tricksters are ever ambivalent, marginal creatures which represent uncertainty and change. Spirits are present, and cannot be ignored; they do not expect worship in the Christian sense, neither do they tolerate rejection or abuse. My research indicates that while the Chimbu do not worship regulative or creator deities, spiritual involvement permeates their lives. Far from cash-cropping being their major interest, as observations in the 1960s suggested, relationships with the spirit world, albeit for 'worldly5 purposes, retain significance in everyday life in the 1980s. My discussion will follow Lawrence and Meggitt's rejection of a distinction between religion and magic (1965:6-7) and will concentrate on beliefs and rituals through which men and women attempt to extend their relationships into a non-empirical realm whether or not the relationships are of a propitiatory or coercive nature. The term 'non-empirical' may be rather too categorical to be applied to Chimbu spirits without qualification as from an ernie viewpoint there is often little distinction made between man, the environment and the spirits. As Lawrence and Meggitt (1965:8) state in their introduction to Gods, Ghosts and Men..., religion cannot be seen as a cultural isolate. In both the Highlands and on the Coast religion must be seen within the context of the entire cosmic order and is involved in both economic production and the socio-political system. The nature of invisible beings with whom men and women believe it is possible to have relationships is one aspect of religious studies which has always interested the student of small-scale exotic societies. Definitions of what constitutes religion have been broadened in recent years as new ideas have entered the public domain making the old pejorative term 'pagan' untenable. It has been a slow process however, and even in Melanesia, one of the last culture areas of the world to be colonised and studied ethnographically, there has been a strong tendency to categorise societies in terms of a Euro-centric model. Thus societies which recognised a 'high-god' and which engaged in religious practices 'for their own sake' were somehow more readily acceptable to Europeans than those which practised 'ancestor worship' or even had dealings with 'demons'. Definitions of religious behaviour have been further stretched in the course of ethnographic studies and we are less ready now than in former times to classify behaviour into rigid categories of secular and sacred. If religion were merely concerned with humanity's desire for life after death then few Melanesian societies in the pre-Christian period could have been said to be religious. Pragmatism and concern for worldly well-being is most often seen as being characteristic of the Highlanders' interest in spiritual matters. 60</page><page sequence="3">Hughes Ethnographers have, by their very nature, a strong desire to classify everything they find in 'the field'. Thus Melanesian spirit-beings have been commonly categorised into a three-fold division (cf. Lawrence and Meggitt 1965:8). These are creative deities and culture heroes who have long ago ceased to participate in daily life, tricksters and demons whose only function appears to be to cause trouble, and finally, the dead whose spirits may help or harm mankind according either to whim or man's behaviour. It is the dead, both recent ghosts and ancestors with whom relationships appear to be strongest in most Melanesian societies. Creative deities hold little interest for clansmen and trouble making spirits are unlikely to co-operate in human enterprises. Greatest attention has therefore been f ocussed by fieldworkers on the ancestors who remain part of the clan and maintain an interest in its members. While the three-fold division is retained in this discussion its emphasis is slightly different from that which is described above. In Chimbu, creator spirits are singularly absent; culture heroes who taught the clans the rudiments of social living are characters in myth, but they play no roles in modern life. There are no rituals performed to express love or worship of a creator deity, a situation which years of Christian missionary effort has not significantly altered. Nilles pursued a deistic theme in his early writing, maintaining that religious practices consisted mainly of supplication and sacrifices (1950:56). This may have been the case in the 1930s and 1940s but I found little evidence of this in the early 1980s. Nilles himself, still ministering to the people in the 1980s, is less convinced of innate spirituality in the sense he earlier believed (personal communication 1980). My classification begins with ancestors. It is these spirits who play the most dramatic parts in the Chimbu cosmos and whose wishes are considered when new enterprises are embarked upon. The second category consists of those spirits who are loosely labelled tricksters; these spirits are sometimes more playful than harmful and can be treated with under certain circumstances. The transactional model of behaviour (Barth 1966:17) upon which all social relationships beyond the extended family, are based in Chimbu applies equally well to trickster spirits. The third category consists of spirits who do not interact with human beings except to cause harm. This category is a division of the more general trickster classification, as Chimbu differentiate sharply between mere playfulness and evil. At the heart of all Chimbu interactions with spirits is a desire for reciprocity. This may be seen in the inclusion of the ancestors at all stages of the pig festivals, the 'games' which are played with tricksters and the evasion which is the norm with spirits who are wholly opposed to humanity. Spirits which enter into relationships with men and women are seen as partners in the social reproduction of life. The departure of these ancestral spirits is inconceivable and the maintenance of their goodwill an ever abiding pre-occupation. There is so much unpredictability perceived by clansmen in the modern world that the continuity provided by the ancestors is seen as vital by clansmen and women of all ages, both rural and urban. Involvement of the ancestors and related spirits in the pig festival which is described below, is the most concrete evidence of the continuing need for clansmen to attempt to ensure clan stability. This does not, however, account for the persistence of equally powerful, capricious and frequently evil spirit of witchcraft or Jaimo which has lost none of its power in the years since European contact. Indeed many informants believe that Jaimo has gained in significance in recent years as inequalities have magnified and jealousy is pervasive. A possible interpretation, which is supported by informants, is that huno represents a unique force which the Europeans and the huge social changes they initiated can neither 61</page><page sequence="4">Demons and Tricksters understand nor annul. No amount of preaching against kumo by the missionaries has diminished its importance; it is a power unique to the people and is not lightly discarded The consuming interest of Highlanders in exchanging food and valuables has proved to be almost equally matched by the enthusiasm with which legions of fieldworkers have researched this phenomenon. The movement of vast amounts of goods and the networks through which they travel have provided material for many papers and monographs. The greatest emphases have been on the examination of rational self-interested behaviour and the social values which have been expressed through the distributions. Rubel and Rosman's classification of thirteen Papua New Guinea societies' exchange systems differentiates Chimbu exchanges from most other societies, in that Chimbu are deeply involved in 'a complex structure of exchange with the spirit world' (1978:33). This observation remains as true in the 1980s as it was when studied by an earlier generation of fieldworkers. When distributions occur which involve men and spirits rather than men and men, it is necessary to take special account of the symbolic meanings which are being expressed between the giver and receiver. A tangible loss is never sustained in any prestation to a spirit; the essence is deemed sufficient and the major recipients are in fact the donors. Statements of the recognition of the importance of kinship continuity are made through voluntary gifts to spirits who are believed innately benevolent, while gifts to spirits in other categories express the desire for social and spatial distancing. Schieff elin (1980:503) suggests that social reciprocity contributes to the social construction of reality in Kaluli society. One could go further in Chimbu society, which is at least overtly more consumed by reciprocal exchanges than the Kaluli, and suggest that reciprocity is reality in Chimbu society. It is the model upon which social and 'super-social' relationships are based and which governs dealings at every leveL Analysis of the interactions which clansmen believe occur between themselves and the various unseen beings involves more than mere ritual activity, morality is inextricably bound up with their conception of the universe. I have found Sahñns' reciprocity continuum (1972:193) a useful model when considering Chimbu relationships in both the social and the 'super-social' realms (Hughes 1985:78). Lawrence uses a similar model to discuss both human and super-human relationships among the Garia of Madang province (1984 passim), 'Security circles' indicate both ego's interpersonal networks and his relationships with superhumans and provide explanations of much of Garia social behaviour. Sahlin's reciprocity continuum explains how reciprocity becomes attenuated the further one moves from the centre of the ego-centric circle. At the centre, relationships are governed by moral considerations until at the extremities of social life it is every one for himself. In practical terms the reciprocity continuum explains how generalised reciprocity or altruistic exchange works within a small circle of family and sub-clan relationships. Further from the centre in relationships with allies, more distant kinsmen and affines, balanced reciprocity obtains and moral behaviour is contingent upon good relationships being maintained At the end of the social universe are those with whom no mutually acceptable interaction is normally possible. This group consists of those with whom exchanges do not voluntarily occur and with whom negative reciprocity obtains. Warfare is the most positive and frequent form of interaction which occurs between persons who feel themselves to be in this relationship. Schieffelin (1980:506) refers to an opposition scenario in which loss is sustained at the hands of the perpetrator. This brings about a state of opposition or social tension and the desire for social redress. Transferring this model to the spiritual realm it may be seen that parallel concepts apply. The ancestors fill the generalised exchange portion of the continuum; 62</page><page sequence="5">Hughes their assistance and interest in clan affairs remains as strong as when they were alive. Tricksters, in characteristic fashion, defy simple classification and do not fit so readily into the balanced reciprocity segment. Their puckish nature allows them to move freely between the boundaries of balanced and negative reciprocity and whim appears to play a major role in their relationships with humanity. Demons, however, have no such ambiguity and are always classified as beings with whom no relationships are desirable or possible. There is no equivalent to relations through warfare as there is in the human realm; avoidance appears to be the only safe option as no gains are possible. A continuum of anthropomorphism also parallels the reciprocity and morality continuum. At the centre of the circle the ancestors have not undergone any transformation from their bodily form and spirits regarded as analogous to ancestors have quasi-human representations (see below). Both tricksters and demons have incredible shape-changing capacities which enable them to appear either as ordinary people, as animals, spectres or powerful forces of nature. This desire to anthropomorphise acceptable beings and 'de-anthropomorphise' undesirable beings would appear to be a common trait in most religious and political systems. We do the same with our popular representation of animals to express our affinity with friendly* mammals and birds while distorting the characteristics of those creatures for which we feel fear or revulsion such as snakes or spiders. THE INNER CIRCLE The remainder of the paper is a more detailed examination of the roles clansmen and women believe invisible beings play in their lives and the ritual with which some of these relationships are maintained. The first classification of ancestors extends, as foreshadowed above, to other spirits who are believed to take a proprietary interest in the affairs of clansmen. I found spirits known as koa and gema which will shortly be discussed to be in this category. All spirits with whom generalised reciprocity obtains are masculine; females do not become ancestors in this patrilineal society and both koa andgerua have almost exclusively male connotations. All the Chimbu clans with whom I workea had a concept of an entity known as the kuia, which maybe glossed as spirit or soul, present in each person. It is believed to reside in the liver and, during dreams, roams freely about. At death the kuia is permanently released from the body, but remains close to the corpse until the correct mortuary rites have been performed There is no pre-Christian concept of a physical realm in which the deceased permanently reside (Nilles 1950:62) but a number of elderly informants maintained that following mortuary rites, the kuia could travel to and from north Chimbu to a place called Womkana or Womatne as it is more commonly known today. All north and central clans name Womkana as the place of creation from which the clans originally dispersed. Newman (1965:258) and other writers on several Highlands societies, differentiate sharply between ghosts and ancestors, although earlier researchers in Chimbu did not. I discovered, however that a clear distinction is made by the Chimbu themselves. Every dead person, male and female, becomes a ghost or gigl but only a limited number become ancestors. Ghosts are therefore intrinsically malevolent as they resent the impermanence of their state and wish to vent their anger on the living. After death the kuia remains at the cemetery or gigl pene and it is believed that if the family include him or her in feasts there is little to fear. The point at which the kuia is transformed into a ghost or gigl was not well defined by informants. 63</page><page sequence="6">Demons and Tricksters The concept of a person being sub-divided into physical and spiritual entities was seen by the early missionaries as the basis on which to build a new Christian spirituality. However, there are a number of limitations to the concept of the kuia as a parallel concept to the soul, as it is not seen to be fixed in a permanent post-death state. Indeed thekuia of a woman had no possibility of permanancy after death. Unlike men, there is no possibility of ancestorhood for women in this patrilineal society. Access to the benevolent members of the spirit world is largely controlled by gilgiaiyagl, an expert in spiritual matters, but an ordinary man would recognise his duty to maintain grave sites and offer bugia gigl (spirit pigs) at the pig feast (bugia gende). This is a large scale food exchange similar to the Mdpamoka (Strathern 1977) and the Enga te (Feil 1978) in which hundreds or even thousands of pigs are killed Greatest emphasis in the literature has always been f ocussed on the presentations between clans, and the less spectacular but extremely important presentation to the clan ancestors has received less attention (Rubel and Rosman 1978:312). The recent inclusion of such items as beer and cattle are obvious innovations in bugia gende which a partial cash economy has brought about. The retention of traditional, sacred aspects of these rituals is less thoroughly documented and may have been assumed to have been eclipsed in the prevailing materialistic climate. I found that at all stages of the bugia gende the ancestors are believed to play an active role (Brown 1970:105, Nilles 1950:41). From the flute blowing which signals the initial decision to prepare for a pig feast to its culmination, the ancestors are involved in many ways in both ensuring the success of the feast to enjoying its fruits. Clansmen cannot conceive of a feast without ancestral participation and inform them of all stages of the progress towards the feast. Bugia gende is a celebration of clan fertility and continuity which equally involves ancestors, men, women and pigs (Brown 1961:79). When problems arose within the clan, independent divination of the cause was almost always the prerogative oígílgíaiyagl who would attempt to restore good relations between ancestors and their descendants. Exhumation and greasing of bones with pig fat was commonly recommended when gilgiai yagl divined ancestral displeasure. The ancestors' needs were taken into account in much the same way as living clan members and even in pre-colonial migrations, ancestors were believed to accompany their clan. Relationships were simple and based on a generalised reciprocal model. There was no concept of a body of doctrine from which some might deviate; practice was self- verifying: if the ancestors did not send trouble to the cl?n then they were satisfied with the gifts they periodically received which occurred largely within the context of the bugia gende. Field observations at Mintima and Yuagle in central Chimbu in early 1981 almost two years after I had heard the flutes blown to signify early preparation of bugia gende, revealed the presence of large rough hewn planks known as ende bungo which had been erected on the summit of the nearest mountain. The planks faced outwards from Naregu territory towards neighbouring clan land. This practice, which is known as ende paiwai, is a signal to the ancestors that good progress is being made towards the feast and represents a request for their help in ensuring that the enterprise will be successful. The planks remained on the hillside for several months and were then taken down and incorporated into the roof structure of the gerua house or gema ìngu which were constructed for each subclan. Agilgiaiyagl explained that without the incorporation of the ende bungo it is impossible to build this important structure. Further signals to the Naregu ancestors included the bugia bolun bekwa or phallic pole which topped the bolim haw at the feast ground. A cross now replaces the bugia bolim bekwa in some clans at the insistence of the Catholic priests but this is often in addition to a less visible phallic pole which is seen as an essential part of the rite, 64</page><page sequence="7">Hughes contributing much to the fertility aspects. One informant explained that often the cross is mounted on the bugia bolim bekwa itself which is a synthesis in which both parties find satisfaction.7 To ensure fertility the pole is rubbed with grease from the bugia gigl or spirit pigs which are killed at the cemetery (gigl pene) some time before the main kill. Once killed the pig is not merely meat for the living but also spiritual food for the dead A club is used to strike the animal above the snout, giving time for the pig to direct its spirit to where it wished it to go (Mantovani 1977:159). The ancestors thus receive the earliest share and give a blessing to the feasting which takes place over succeeding days. In return for this attention and gifts the ancestors are expected to reciprocate by ensuring that the pig herd grows well and multiplies satisfactorily in the several years between the initial decision and the feast's culminatioa In addition, the ancestors should refrain from causing misfortune to the clan. The remaining two members of the first group of spirits, koa and gema, have never been human members of the clan but their interest in the clansmen and the benefits which they are believed to confer, brings them within the circles of generalised reciprocity. Koa and gema are not thought of as entities separate from the ancestors, nor are they identical. They are spirits of fertility and strength and act to assist the ancestors in their work through the generations. They are not gods to be worshipped, but rather partners in the life process. Both spirits have physical representation: koa the bamboo flute, gema the sacred head board. Koa was a closely guarded secret from women, gema was not. Koa has undergone considerable transformation in the years since initial missionary intervention and has long ago lost its secret, exclusive male characteristics through desacralisation of the flutes. Koa symbolised male domination and denied the full personhood of womea They were told by their husbands and fathers that the sound of the flutes was the voice of a spirit bird which would destroy any uninitiated person who looked upon it, i.e. any woman or child. Each extended family had its own special flute tune which had been passed down from the ancestors. Male initiation traditionally occurred during the final preparatory phases of bugia gende and women and children were told that the flutes were drinking the blood of the pigs (Rubel and Rosman 1978:313). The existence of sacred flutes in many parts of the Highlands was noted by early fieldworkers particularly in the eastern and central Highlands.9 Koa appears to be synonymous with the Eastern Highlands nama described by Read (1952:24) among the Gahuku Gama. Read maintained that the flutes were at the heart of a cult through which men retained their power over women and confirmed the values of their society. I do not believe that a koa cult could have ever been said to have existed in Chimbu; it was certainly important in male initiation but it appears more likely that koa was significant within the larger area of agnate solidarity. Since the secret male character of the flutes has been exposed by the missionaries it might be thought that they are now merely ordinary musical instruments. This is not the case, however, and although their exclusive male nature is reduced, the flutes and the spirit they represent retains significance especially when bugia gende is planned. Field observations of such preparations provide clear evidence that koa has not been eclipsed except in its harsher aspects concerning male domination. Genia is more concerned with nurture than with strength; male power is secondary to growth, fertility and well-being. The spiritual being is represented by the gema head board which is made for particular persons with the explicit intention of protecting and strengthening the wearer. Informants always stressed the importance of making a gema board only for serious reasons, when it might be expected to confer well-being and prosperity. Gema are always presented and usually made by the person 65</page><page sequence="8">Demons and Tricksters who stands in the relationship of father to the recipient. They range in size from 15cm. x 20cm. to 30cm. x 60cm. SmaHgerua would be made for both boys and girls to prevent them from growing up stunted, blind or crippled (Nilles 1950:60) and larger genia were made for initiations, bugia gende, illness and marriage. Women did not commonly receive gema except in special circumstances when a post-menopausal woman was honoured by her husband at a bugia gende. The honorific title bugia mam was applied to such a woman who had distinguished herself by the number and quality of the pigs she had raised for her husband For the day of the feast she was dressed as a man, the highest honour a Chimbu man can pay his wife. The gema board is made of wood from the okavuole or ongono tree because of the lightness of these woods.10 The equipment used in the manufacture oí gema is also believed to be a manifestation of the spirit and is an integral part of the gema presentation ceremony. It consists of a small bamboo tube containing the paint (a mixture of clay and vegetable extract) and the stone with which the board was cut. All items were carefully stored in a woman's house. After use the board is left to rot at the cemetery, usually hanging on a tree. Although the life of eachgema board is limited, as is man's, a metaphor for the group's immortality is expressed by investing the equipment with the continuing power of the spirit. In times of crisis when the genia spirit was thought to be displeased, old gema boards were accorded the same treatment as the bones of a supposedly irate ancestor. They were removed from the cemetery, cleaned and replaced on the tree. Almost identical practices were noted by Newman among the Gururumba of the Eastern Highlands (1965:69). The intervention of the Christian missions in the 1950s resulted in the genia becoming a secret part of life for a generation but this situation has altered in recent years.11 A basic trust in all three types of spirit described above is at the heart of all Chimbu relationships with either the ancestors, koa or gema. They may send misfortune, but in the fashion of a firm parent they are generous when not thwarted in their plans for their children. THE OUTER CIRCLE The step from sharing to prestation is not a long one. However it is of considerable importance in the New Guinea context where it is frequently said to mark the difference between 'us' (my people: those with whom I share food) and 'them' (those with whom I exchange) (Schieffelin 1980:511-12). In contrast to the esteem in which ancestral spirits are held, trickster spirits are seen as totally unpredictable and relationships are avoided where possible. There are three types of beings which may be classified as tricksters: these include Kurara Yagl, the most human of the group, kanggigtgl, which sometimes appears in partial human form and kumo, the name given to persons who are believed to possess powers of witchcraft. All three are marginal in their natures and if they are satisfied that 'gifts' outweigh 'insults' they may not use their devious powers to harm clansmen and womea Chimbu believe that all beings in this group have true physical bodies which are readily perceived by human beings. Appearance changing is a common characteristic and their liminality is heightened by the confusion of the roles of man, woman, animal and spirit. Relationships with this group are surrounded with taboos which Schieffelin (1980:514) suggests protects the integrity of relations between the human and non-human realms in which destructive social reciprocity is likely to occur. 66</page><page sequence="9">Hughes Kurara Yagl, joker man, has all the unpleasant characteristics normally attributed to tricksters in other parts of the world; lustfulness, greed, vanity, and spitefulness (Brandon 1970:623, Ricketts 1965:327). He is, however, also a culture hero who combines greatness with his foibles and knavery. In his appetites he maybe likened to an animal and he also has some of the characteristics associated with witches. However, unlike witches, who are usually female in Chimbu, Kurara Yagl is not always condemned for his appetites as his greed and lust are seen as excusable male traits. Unlike human beings he has no home but moves from the wild to the village in search of clansmenandwomenwhomhemay dupe. Inmost cultures in which tricksters appear, tales of their deeds are situated in the past. This is not the case in Chimbu however, as Kurara Yagl has been able to adapt to changing conditions and true to type is able to take advantage of new opportunities. Unlike all the other beings with which this paper is concerned the trickster is encountered only in story; tales are related of his grotesque exploits but no one claims to know him. Kurara Yagl is marginal in that he is neither god nor spirit, nor is he an ordinary man. The duality which trickster embodies has long been noted as one of man's most abiding obsessions (Jung 1969:204). He defines the border between order and disorder so that men may test the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. Disorder belongs to the totality of life, and the spirit of this disorder is the trickster. His function in an archaic society is ... to add disorder to order and so make a whole, to render possible, within the fixed boundaries of what is permitted, an experience of what is not permitted (Kerenyi 1969:185). Kurara Yagl defies categorisation even in limited human terms, as he is neither bigmar^rabisman nor ordinary man. Any interaction with him is fraught with danger as he is seldom bested. Yet Chimbu have a fascination for tales which relate how ordinary people attempt to outsmart him and how infrequently they succeed. Gifts are not reciprocated except by treachery and yet there is always a grudging respect expressed when encounters with him are related. His reciprocity is in his boundary stretching and in the amusement he provides. Gigf kanggi are examples of spirits which are found throughout the Highlands. In Eastern Highlands they are known as nokondisi (Newman 1965:63, 65) and in central Enga they are called puüituli (Brennan 1977:17). All have many characteristics in common and a few differences which do not detract from their basic similarity. Kanggi inhabit forest areas, swamps and hillsides, all places through which men pass, but in which they never make their homes. Their margbality expresses itself in many ways, particularly in their territorial behaviour, their appearance and their concepts of reciprocity. Kanggi have shape-changing abilities and may appear as man, animal or tree, while their footprints are those of dogs or marsupials (Hughes 1985:84). like all tricksters their natures are exceedingly capricious and most feared of all their abilities is their capacity to possess the kiiia of men and women. The twin concepts of order and disorder or chaos are one of the most central of the dualities by which Chimbu classify their world. Thus the basic dualities of clansmen, non-clansmen, living and dead are carried on into concepts of space. In the natural world which for the pre-contact clansmen was physically small and bounded, relationships had a degree of predictability but in the areas of 'non-space' disorder and unpredictability prevailed. Non-space was the region of the bush, the swamp and other clansmen's territory where negative relationships obtained and men entered at their own risk. If it is absolutely necessary to enter kanggi territory it is considered wise to 67</page><page sequence="10">Demons and Tricksters leave food offerings. If this is not done there is a likelihood that possession by the spirit will subsequently occur. In its most dramatic forms kanggf possession causes the victim to run about screaming through the bush. Kanggi are very fond of human infants and if given the opportunity will steal or swap children in exchange for their own off-spring. Thus children who grew up weak, crippled, ugly or deformed were known to be kanggi children and would be returned to the forest if the kanggi proved unwilling to reverse the exchange. The services of a smoke magician, kanimbineyagl, were often sought to exorcise the kanggi spirit which was frequently placated by the offering of gifts including pork and ceremonial valuables. Fortunately, kanggi were satisfied with the essence of the sacrifice and everything was returned at the conclusion of the ritual. Involvement with kanggi was never sought and gifts were not forthcoming unless the kanggi indicated displeasure. Clansmen expressed some grudging respect for the kanggi as it is believed that it is the guardian of the pig herds. In fact kanggi believed that they were the actual owners of the pigs and so a wise man would remember this when a pig was killed and tell the kanggi that it was a gift for him as he had guarded it from birth. The balanced reciprocal model applied, as the kanggi was expected to continue to guard the rest of the herd (Aufenanger 1960:675). The importance of gigl kanggi to most clansmen with whom I spoke on the subject appears to have diminished since Aufenanger carried out his fieldwork in the 1950s. Northern clans believed that kanggi had retreated to the sparsely inhabited southern district, while southern and central groups thought that most kanggi had departed to the slopes of Mt. Wilhelm in the north. One informant explained that few people feared kanggi any longer as roads now ran close to much of their territory and kanggi are afraid of the noise of vehicles and so had dispersed to still untouched regions where they did not cause a great deal of interference in clansmen's lives. The final member of the 'trickster' group is so marginal that it defies any ready categorisation. Kwno is the spirit of witchcraft which possesses the bodies of human beings and gives its host the desire and the power to perpetrate the most despicable acts. Its classification as a trickster may appear questionable as it is difficult to imagine any reciprocity being possible with such a creature. It does however, share some human sensibilities and it is these which prevent a kwno individual from being automatically and irredeemably beyond the pale. As Kurara Yagl is a lovable, peripatetic male trickster and gigl kanggji is a tolerable, bush-dwelling, androgynous trickster, so kumo is a fearful female trickster who may be your next door neighbour. Kumo is by far the most powerful and pervasive spirit in Chimbu today. It is a topic of frequent conversation and unlike some of the other spirits, its significance has not diminished in the minds of the people. Some clansmen believe that kumo is more powerful now than formerly as there are greater reasons for jealousy upon which kumo thrives. Kumo has many parallels with witchcraft beliefs in other societies, the most important being its ascription of evil powers to a marginal personality within the group. The word kumo actually refers to a creature or animal which cannot act alone but uses its powers to possess a host or 'mother' as it is sometimes known. It is important to understand that anyone may be a potential kwno. It is an innate pre-disposition which may have been lying dormant, merely requiring an invitation from another kumo to become active. The kumo most commonly takes the form of a rat, snake or bat. When not engaged in its evil activities it resides inside the host's body, usually in his or her head Kumo y is in fact an alter ego and acts quite independently, although initial assent is required before it can be activated Although in theory a kumo person may be either a man or woman, in practice women kumo (kumo ambii) far outnumber male kumo, 68</page><page sequence="11">Hughes (kumoyagí) . This may be at least partly explained by the nature of this patrilineal society in which all men within a sub-clan are theoretically brothers and all women are outsiders. All the kumo of whom I obtained first or second hand knowledge were women who did not conform to the female stereotype. Independence, mobility, power and the unmarried state, which were the antitheses of a traditional woman's role, were common characteristics oikumo ambu. Kiimo shares with all Chimbu, both human and 'spiritual', a great love of meat. However, unlike all normal people, kumo are insatiably greedy and uncontrolled and will go to any lengths to obtain flesh, either animal or human. Chimbu believe that a kumo kills other clan members and either mystically or physically eats the body after burial. Kumo also have powers of flight and are not hindered in their movements by normal physical barriers such as walls, roofs, earth and flesh. The catalogue oikumo activities is considerable and is not entirely appropriate in this paper, but the point I wish to stress is the fearful nature of the concept, involving as it does people with whom one has daily contact. The suspicion and anxiety that illness and misfortune maybe the result of a lack of generosity on one's part or worse still, caprice on the part of the huno, is a force generating internal disunity and suspicion of one's neighbours. Fortunately, there are redeeming features in the Chimbu kumo which provide the rationale for the inclusion oikumo in the trickster group, a classification which is not commonly made. Apart from a generation of effective colonial rule during the 1950s and 1960s, warfare has always been a major pre-occupation of most Highlanders. Times of war always unify groups and nullify differences and internal enmities, and Chimbu clansmen and women may generally be seen to follow this pattern. While the powers oikumo were always used for its own entirely selfish purposes in times of peace, warfare promoted a degree of unity in which even kumo could sometimes be involved. For suitable recompense their services could be obtained to assist in the enemy's defeat. Pieces of clothing from a kumo ambu were rubbed over the weapons to enhance their killing power by clansmen of Iobokogl in Sinasina. In the west the Siku clan did not bother to gain co-operation from their own kumo ambu but utilised the powers of a kumo ambu from another clan by seizing her and removing a piece of hair or clothing for use in a divination ritual (Hughes 1985:464). In more dramatic fashion akwno ambu can lead her clan into battle as the arrows are less likely to harm her and she can provide inspiration and strength to clansmen.14 A conversion of the evil powers of kumo is also a possibility in several clans among whom fieldwork was conducted. This is a process in which the kumo undergoes resocialisation and uses her powers to heal rather than harm. This conversion does not occur merely on whim but is a result of a traumatic occurrence in which the life of the kumo, or rather its host, is threatened. Kumo never publicly acknowledge their powers unless they have undergone a rite of passage in which they reveal themselves and promise to use their power for the benefit of the clan. Even after that, in true trickster fashion, they do not necessarily refrain from causing harm to fellow clansmen and women. During the first year of fieldwork at Yuagle in central Chimbu two deaths were directly attributed to vìkumo ambu who also worked as a professional healer (Hughes 1985, 1987). While kumo may be thought of as an instrument of male domination this is only one aspect of its significance in the clan power structure. Women do not feel condemned by the almost exclusive ascription oikumo to them. Rather, it is somehow prized as a generalised female capability, it is a power source upon which women may draw if the need arises. 69</page><page sequence="12">Demons and Tricksters BEYOND THE RECIPROCITY CIRCLE The final group of spirits consists of those beings which may be described as demons. They are completely devoid of human reciprocity, beyond the moral order (Lawrence 1984:233 following Burridge 1965) and cannot be placated by gifts. There are only two representatives of this group but they are held responsible for a considerable amount of damage. The first is dingaan, a forest and swamp dwelling creature which has some of the evil characteristics of kanggi but none of its positive aspects. An obvious function of demon beliefs '..is to stress a fundamental opposition between the demons-in-the-forest and the-humans-in-the-settlement' (Meggitt 1976:68). This is an example of the nature/culture dichotomy which is of perennial interest to all mankind. Dingaan never interact with human society except to cause illness or devastation. It is not possible for human beings to harm them, but they can be roused to harmful acts by mere trespass in their domain. Dingaan is a polysemous term referring firstly to the spirit of disease, secondly to a person who is afflicted with disease diagnosed as dingaan possession, and finally to a dirty, unkempt person (Aufenanger 1972:30). Dingaan is responsible for very serious illness and disabilities including deafness, dumbness, insanity, emaciation and leprosy. A dingaan gains control of an individual by consuming his household or bodily waste. This provides a strong sanction against careless disposal of waste products, a ready excuse for the disposal of unwanted human beings in pre-colonial times and a disincentive against moving from settled areas into less healthy country where dingaan reside. Meggitt (1976:68) noted that the Mae Enga had a belief in a variety of forest dwelling demonswhich appear tobe comparable todingaan. Adingaan or forest demon maybe said to express the ambivalence experienced by a horticultural people who still rely on the bush for some of their most prized possessions; cassowaries and bird of paradise plumes. Unlike belief in the power oí kanggi to harm human beings which has diminished since European contact as kanggi has retreated further from human life, belief in dingaan, who may be found in the earth remains strong. Dingaan is now also associated with venereal disease as illicit intercourse frequently occurs in gardens where the degrime worm may lurk ready to gain possession through contact with semen.16 Dingaan are physically represented by the degime worm which may be seen by any gardener; they appear quite harmless and yet cause injury and death to 'transgressors'. Beyond dingaan at the furthest edge of the reciprocity continuum where no contact, accidental or otherwise is conceivable, ar q gerigl kimagl. They are an aspect of a universal tendency to attribute evil powers and intentions to a group of people with whom very limited contact is maintained Such a group for many Chimbu clans are the people of Bundi in Madang province to the north of Chimbu. Although long existing trading routes have been maintained with the Bundi region, Chimbu clansmen do not include the people of Bundi in any of their ceremonial exchanges. Gerigl kimagl are 'poisonous people' who, like a number of Chimbu spirits, have dual natures in that they are both creators and destroyers. They also have shape-changing powers like all non-ancestral spirits. While a crowd is gathered they will change themselves from human form into birds of paradise by employing smoke magic. Chimbu informants were divided on the issue of the humanity of Bundi people, who some maintained were aUgerigl kiniagL In their destructive activities gerigl khnagl are also known for their creativeness which, however, is often used for the purposes of annihilation. During the Pacific War a stray Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb on Mingende Catholic mission in central Chimbu. This was widely believed to have been created by gerigl kimagl to destroy the Siambugla-Waugla clansmen on whose land the 70</page><page sequence="13">Hughes mission was built. Their most feared power, however, is their ability to create landslides and during fieldwork this power was dramatically demonstrated The attack was prompted by the unfaithfulness of a north Chimbu woman who had married a man from Bundi. After she ran away to her own clan the husband threatened that her village would soon be destroyed by gerigf kimagL Three weeks later in November 1979 heavy rain caused severe flooding just as people were returning home from their gardens. Nineteen people and many pigs were killed, and many trade stores and gardens were destroyed in the huge mudslides which followed. Clansmen from Womatne were absolutely certain that the flood and landslide were caused by gerigl Jdmagl to repay the insult their people had received. Many, in fact, personified the flood and mudslide as gerigl Jdmagf. The beings which inhabit the area beyond the reciprocity circle are a metaphor for everything which is unpredictable and totally beyond the control of man. They are responsible for disease, uncleanliness and those aspects of nature which sweep away man's efforts to tame it. The Chimbu lead a precarious life, gardening on unterraced slopes which defy imagination, and are always aware of the innate fragility of their social and economic lives. Both dingaan and gerigl Idmagjl personify the forces which threaten the sometimes tenuous grip they have in maintaining their lifestyle. These spirits provide a counterbalance to the clan stability which is assured by the ancestors. Individuals and areas of land may be destroyed but the life of the clan is infinite. CONCLUSION All the interactions between Chimbu and their spirits which have been discussed in this paper are concerned with the universal problem of achieving a sense of control over unpredictability. In some areas of life there may appear superficially tobe a greater predictability now than was possible in the past. For a time Western medicine, education, economic and political systems provided many of the solutions to a fragmented society which had long been torn by strife and instability. Christian missions have attempted with only partial success to introduce the ultimate security in the form of a moral Christian ufe on earth followed by peace in the afterlife. All of these attempts to create a Chimbu version of the Western way have succeeded in some degree, but none has achieved its full aims. Some problems have been solved, while others, undreamed of in pre-colonial times, have proliferated. The power of the Europeans to transform the landscape, to alter expectations and to challenge ancient values has not proceeded without much soul-searching on the part of the elders. The retention of belief in the power of spirits to preserve the universe within the co-operative sphere or security circle has maintained Chimbu pride in the face of great challenges from the outside world and now, increasingly, from within. The spirits who are within the inner areles of the reciprocity continuum are still utilised to sustain their descendants in a changing world With the participation of ritual specialists, clansmen and women feel that they have retained a large measure of intellectual and spiritual power which may be used to combat external threats to clan security whether they come from mystical or introduced sources. There are, however, as many spirits who will threaten harmony and control as those who may be expected to uphold them. Both tricksters and demons still exist to tease and try mankind and there are no rituals which will guarantee to prevent their meddling in human affairs. If the beings of the inner circles provided the dominant parable for the conduct of sodai and 'super-social' life in the pre-contact period, then it is the trickster figure which supplies the metaphor for all that is perceived by 'traditionalists' to be wrong with modern life. Uncertainty, greed and lack of reciprocal 71</page><page sequence="14">Demons and Tricksters duties are seen by older Chimbu as characterising much of social change. The trickster's great mobility and easy access to goods, to which he has doubtful rights, make him a 'role model' for the young, educated, upwardly mobile and politically ambitious. The older rural people, however, recognise that there are dangers in attempting to emulate and treat with those with whom relationships are illusionary and capricious. The young rural Chimbu are torn both ways and attempt to move out towards the perimeter of the circle while maintaining their foothold in the centre. Perhaps while the integrity of the circle is maintained, even at its outer limits, Chimbu will retain both their sense of continuity and change and avoid the non-world of the demons where nothing is possible. It is ironic to note that non-space which was formerly defined as the bush or swamp is becoming redefined, at least in the minds of the older generation, as the town, where negative reciprocity is not only possible but is the norm.

Fieldwork was made possible by grants from New Zealand University Grants Committee, La Trobe University's Research Centre for South West Pacific Studies, and the Australian Federation of University Women. 2. Father John Nilles is a German born Catholic priest who later trained in anthropology and who has resided in Chimbu almost continuously since 1937. 3. While koa is a male spirit it has a sexual ambivalence which makes it dangerous for men as well as for women. Koa also refers to menstrual blood which is the most potent symbol of female power and danger. 4. Fieldwork in 1979 was carried out with the Kombalku and Nimamboku sub-clans of Yuagle and Mintima, Waiye census divisions,(C.D.) and in 1980-81 with the Tonggiaku sub-clans of Anigl and Kogo, Waiye CD., Kobula and Maima sub-clans at Mul, Mangi C.D., Bore and Punggama sub-clans at Bi and Tambinyaundo, Kup CD., Siku sub-clan of Kerowagi township and Dinga clans at Emai, Sinasina CD. 5. Nilles (pers. comm.) said that the kiiia of a woman was believed to disappear down a rat hole after death. 6. Both Christian and modern secular innovations have considerably altered bugia gende in the 1980s. A paper is planned in which these changes will be discussed. 7. Prayers led by a catechist in which the ancestors' blessing is invoked are now also added to the ritual. 8. De-sacralisation in the Highlands was achieved by the missionaries in the early years of their ministry. They regarded the flutes as an integral part of a male cult which was inimical to their endeavours. 9. These include Salisbury 1962, Newman 1965, R. Berndt 1962 and Langness 1967. 10. I did not discover the English equivalent for these trees. 11. While the overtly sacred aspects of koa have disappeared for many years, genia has undergone a 'rehabilitation' and is fully restored to its former significance among clans in which it had been earlier prescribed by the Christian missions. A paper in which these changes are assessed is planned. 12. A Kurara Yagl story which I recorded during fieldwork tells of the trickster's exploits while working on a coastal plantation. The trade goods which he acquired during his contract were used creatively when he returned to the Highlands to gain power over his fellows. This contrasts with the coastal spirit beings who actually invented the goods with which they gained power (Hughes 1986). 72</page><page sequence="15">Hughes 13.

A female informant in her late twenties who claimed to possess fatnio, participated in clan warfare during my period of fieldwork. She led her sub-clan against the enemy but expressed her shock when clansmen began to mutilate the bodies with axes.

The death of a young married man at Yuagle was blamed in the first instance on possession by the degrime worm, as his exploits for frequenting coffee gardens for the purpose of illicit intercourse were well known. The skins which are removed by the coffee huller are also thought to be favourite haunts of degrime and my children were sharply warned against treading on these mounds by the people of Yuagle.
