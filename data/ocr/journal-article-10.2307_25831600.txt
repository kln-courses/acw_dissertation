<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TWENTIETH CENTURY By T. V. Benn, Senior Lecturer in French in the University of Leeds, and J. A. Hiddleston, Lecturer in French in the University of Leeds i. General In 1962 several general surveys of 20th-c. lit. have appeared, as if the post-1945 developments were now thought to be at last in focus. A striking effort has been made at the same time to inform the French public on foreign literatures. Indeed, a publ. of 1961 claims to be the first of its kind in this line: La Lit. contemp. a travers le monde, part of a coll. ed. by J. C. Ibert and with a pref. by R. Caillois. A similar book, by J. Bonneville, was noted last year. In the 20th-c. field, more than elsewhere, critics tell the reader what he should know and think, apparently assuming he does not wish to read the books or judge for himself. Much of this criticism is indeed of a high standard, as lit. and as thought (Alberes, Blanchot, Boisdeffre, Caillois, Gaede). A gulf separates this criticism from the investigations whose findings are verifiable. Excellent contributions of the latter kind include E. Bouvier, Lettres franfaises au XXe siecle, C. Vigee, Revoke et louanges, and books by Nguyen-Van-Huy (Camus), Catharine Savage (Gide), P. R. Robert (Giono), T. Z. Ralston (Marcel), J. Onimus (Peguy), H. Bonnet and R. Girard (Proust), F. R. Jameson (Sartre), H. Bouillier (Segalen); among contributors to periodicals should be mentioned L. Spitzer (Butor), I. T. Olken (Colette), J. B. Barrere (R. Martin du Gard), J. P. Richard (Perse), B. Morrissette (Robbe Grillet). G. Zeltner (Sarraute), G. W. Ireland and Judith Robin son (Valery).</page><page sequence="2">138 French Studies Critics and investigators are at present specially busy?in the two camps?on the work of Bernanos and Claudel on the one hand, and on Proust, Robbe-Grillet and Valery on the other. Encourag ing half-glances at stylistics (as against style, 'chose vague') are frequent on both sides of the gulf. Memoirs still attract. Many are also extremely useful: Antoine; Bordeaux, Hist. cTune vie, vm, Plon, 372 pp.; Du Bos, Journal, ix: 1934-39, La Colombe, 284 pp.; Leautaud; Spire, Souvenirs a batons rompus, Michel, 308 pp. The Journal lit. of P. Leautaud is particularly rich. Vols xii-xm take us to June 1941; Leautaud is still John Tell-Truth, and it says much for Valery, Gide, and Duhamel that very little is said against them. There is a good word too for filuard and Follain. The index in each vol. has about 1400 refs. The reminiscences of H. Bosco and of M. Pagnol, on the other hand, are less informative and might be called 'autobiographies romancees'. 2. Bibliography The refs in this art. should be supplemented by consulting the eight sources listed last year (xxiii, pp. 121-2). Another useful source is Who's Who in France, Lafitte, 1961, 2953 pp. 3. Essays and Studies 1962 has produced an unusual crop of books offering a conspectus of 20th-c. lit., French and international. P. de Boisdeffre, in addition to a 3rd ed. of his Hist, vivante de la lit. d'aujourd'hui, 1939-62, Perrin, 803 pp., has edited a Diction naire de lit. contemp., 1900-62, EU, 682 pp., which contains 149 entries by 14 contributors, scores of photos, a 'Tableau de la lit....' of about 120 pages, and an index of about 900 names. This is no doubt the most considerable effort since the Dictionnaire biog., Pharos, of 1950. The entries, however, on the factual side are incomplete and unequal, both as regards biog. and bibl. There are welcome notes about lesser-known recent writers, but a good number of older living writers are unaccountably missing (Camus, filuard and Saint-Exupery remain). The main object of each entry seems to be to summarize chosen works, provide a personal judge ment, and provide telling extracts from other critics. The ' Tableau...' is by seven contributors, incl. ' Le nouveau roman'</page><page sequence="3">The Twentieth Century 139 by Robbe-Grillet, and a fair evaluation of 'La poesie de ce siecle' by G. Sigaux. The outline by E. Bouvier, Les Lettres frangaises au XXe siecle, PUF, iv + 233 pp., is scrupulously fair, without sarcasm or 'smear'; the writer relates the lit. movements of 1895-1914 and 1914-62 to social, political and philosophical ideas, and provides precise bibl. refs, with dates. Notes on 'procedes d'expression' replace vague epithets; good illus., but no index. Twentieth Century French Lit., an Anthology of Prose and Poetry, New York, Macmillan, xiii + 538 pp., ed. by Germaine Bree, is far more than an anthology. The prose extracts and many verse ones are of considerable length and are well selected: about 100 extracts from 33 authors. Each author and each extract is preceded by a factual and critical outline, in French, and there are footnotes in English. There are short, properly dated bibls. Les Lit. contemp. a travers le monde, Hachette, 1961, 368 pp., is a well illus. series of sketches, claiming to be the first of its kind; the lit. of 23 countries, since 1945, is outlined by 21 critics, mainly French. The section on France (34 pages) is a very broad sketch; it tends to treat lit. events as inevitable, and (if past) foreseeable. A more extensive, even broader sketch, has appeared: P. Gioan (ed.), Histoire generate des litteratures, Quillet, 3 vols, 1961, the 3rd vol. of which runs from 1848, with 12 chapters on the period since 1945. A new set of advanced school manuals by A. Lagarde and L. Michard and collaborators, has as its 6th vol. XXe siecle, Bordas, 640 pp., extremely well illus., with outlines, short illustra tive extracts, and short bibls; an improvement on Castex and Surer, workmanlike, and valuable for ref. Reprints have appeared of R. M. Alberes, Bilan lit. du XXe siecle, Aubier, 248 pp., revd., and of M. Girard, Guide illus. de la lit. frangaise moderne, Seghers, 350 pp., revd. to i960. In addition, there are books of essays, and studies of special aspects: H. B. Dunbar, in a New York Ph.D., The impact of the ficole Normale Superieure on selected men of letters (summary in DisA, xxiii, 2, 630), collects evidence, partly from archives, on a wide range of authors, incl. Bergson, Peguy and Rolland, up to 1902, and suggests that much material remains which would throw light on the later period. Avriel H. Goldberg's Bryn Mawr Ph.D., Silhouette of the twentieth century hero in France (summary in DisA, xxii, 12, 4350)</page><page sequence="4">140 French Studies treats fictional and other heroes in G. Sorel, Suares, Rolland, Peguy, Malraux, showing a progressive rehabilitation of man, through heroes who are artists, rebels, often nationalists. A vol. of essays, reprinted mainly from the NL, by R. Kemp, La Vie des livres, 11, Michel, 333 pp., combines scepticism and enthusiasm in its 48 revs, 20 on recent lit.: there is gentle mockery of Rideau on Valery, of Rousseaux on Peguy; some keen remarks (1951) on Camus. The essays are properly dated. Laure Riese, Les Salons lit. parisiens du Second Empire a nos jours, Toulouse, Privat, 275 pp., sketches an extraordinary gallery of portraits, based on personal contacts and a wide reading. There is an index of hostesses, but unfortunately no bibl., and no index of the scores of lit. figures, Proust and others, whose names appear at every turn, nor are the refs given for the numerous quotations. J. Vier, La Lit. a Vemporte-piece, 11, fids du Cedre, 1961, 180 pp., should, as the writer intends, be accepted with caution: the ten dency is 'bien pensant', optimistic, and very contentious, sparing however Claudel and Montherlant. Sartre, and especially Mauriac, are on the wrong side of his fence. These are view points, not investigations. 4. The Novel The novel is more and more an object of interest and controversy? its history, its principles and ' raison d'etre' are discussed not only in general books, but in connexion with certain authors: Robbe Grillet, Butor, Nathalie Sarraute. R. M. Alberes, Histoire du roman moderne, Michel, 461 pp., attempts to relate the novelists of various countries; of about 420 authors touched on, 200 are French, 50 English, 30 American, 140 of other nationalities. The classifications and broad judgements, cryptic or dogmatic, tell the reader what to think; some I9th-c. authors receive heavy broadsides. The remarks on quoted extracts, however, are often sympathetic and illuminating. P. de Boisdeffre, along with the Dictionnaire, issued Oil va le roman?, Del Duca, 311 pp., a picture of the dark minds of recent novelists, without pride, without guide, suffering from shock (1940 and before) and writing 'exercices de purification'. Again we are firmly told what we should think, and on selected evidence. In Robbe-Grillet, B. sees only a 'roman en surface', following R.</page><page sequence="5">The Twentieth Century 141 Barthes and early critics. Much of this highly intelligent criticism should be read with caution. Like R. M. Alberes, B. appears to be convinced of the ' evolution' of lit.: ' Ce que Proust illustre, c'est la metamorphose du roman'?willy-nilly. H. V. Brombert, The Intellectual Hero: Studies in the French novel, 1880-1955, Philadelphia, Lippincott, 1961, 255 pp., on the other hand, though full of broad judgements, presents evidence from investigations, without polemics, showing changes in the common view of the 'intellectual'. The French word 'intellectuel' appears as a noun only sporadically before 1897-8, when it designates an unpractical bookworm. By the 1950's he has become the (equally despised) metaphysician, who is nevertheless filled with a sense of social responsibility. A section of the CAEF, 14, presents six papers under the heading ' Formes et techniques du roman francais'; comment on some of these papers appears under gracq and robbe-grillet, below. An art. by R. Champigny, 'Delimitation du genre romanesque', MLN, lxxvii, 3, also deals with techniques?inter vention of the author, methods of avoiding this, such as interior monologue or second-person narrative as in Butor. Another technique is sketched in R. Konstantinovic, 'Les silences elo quents', Bull, des jeunes romanistes, Strasbourg, no. 6, which suggests lines of investigation which could be undertaken; the examples are drawn from Saint-Exupery, Mauriac and Vercors. A symposium ed. by J. Cruickshank, The Novelist as Philosopher .. .1935-60, Oxford U.P., viii + 257 pp., is not the 'fourre-tout' one French critic thinks it is. A clear introd. is followed by essays on a restricted selection of authors: Bernanos, Malraux, Queneau, Sartre, Beckett, Blanchot, Beauvoir, Cayrol, Camus and Robbe Grillet. The order is that of date of birth. Most of the studies provide thoughtful correctives (e.g. on Camus). Particularly lucid are the essays on Queneau and Beckett (M. Esslin) and Sartre and Robbe-Grillet (J. Weightman), though the latter finds it difficult to enjoy R.-G.'s novels or to give them credit for any psychological significance. The index incl. titles, and there are partial bibls giving English and American transls. J. B. Davis, Autonomie et relativisme dans le roman frangais contemp., a Pennsylvania Ph.D. (summary in DisA, xxiii, 4, 1362), appears to have reached some conclusions similar to those of V. H. Brombert; the publ. of the thesis would be of interest.</page><page sequence="6">142 French Studies Fictional characters in two groups of authors are discussed: in Bernanos, Gide, Mauriac and Malraux, mysterious and un predictable; in Sartre and later authors, subject to a new 'optique romanesque', and 'relativist' factors, especially in the 'nouveau roman', where the author appears to intervene less and less. An art. by R. Macksey, 'The artist in the labyrinth: Design or "Dasein"', MLN, lxxvii, 3, is a venturesome and interesting discussion of this topic in particular: the novelist, in ceasing to be omniscient, is driven to seek truth by devious means?the 'lantern in a mirror', or taking the part of Daedalus?perhaps fruitlessly. S. Radine, Quelques aspects du roman policier psychologique, Geneva, Eds du Mont-Blanc, i960, 295 pp., is for the most part merely descriptive; about a third of the book refers to French writers, incl., of course, Simenon. Roman 61, ed. by J. Petit, Besancon, Institut de langue et de civilisation francaises, xiv + 250 pp., has the merit of reporting, however shortly, on genuine observations: the tendencies in about 150 novels of 1961 are put in order; the points made are worth following up. There are about 50 extracts, of roughly 5 pages each. It is to be hoped that there will be a sequel for 1962. 5. Drama Europe, xl, 396/7, a special no., collects 210 pages of irreplaceable and often moving contributions on the theatre since 1890, mainly by eye-witnesses of the work of P. Fort, Gemier, Lugne-Poe, Rouche, Copeau, R. Martin du Gard, Jouvet, Dullin and Baty, with a 'chronologie' of the performances at Avignon and the T.N.P. Another eye-witness, A. P. Antoine, in Antoine, pere et fits.. .1900-39, Julliard, 303 pp., gives an absorbing narrative of his father's struggles to reform the theatre, and the public, and to make ends meet. There are also revealing sketches of the chief actors, and of Becque, Tailhade, Curel, Saint-Pol-Roux, Porto Riche, Bernstein, Renard, Zola, and Cocteau. There is no index, and a regrettable absence of dates. The exhibition catalogue L. Jouvet, Bibl. Nat., 1961, 56 pp., provides a 'chronologie' of performances 1923-51, as well as unpubl. pieces, photos and other docs. The exhibition was rev. in RHT, xiv, 1, by A. M. Moudoues.</page><page sequence="7">The Twentieth Century 143 M. Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd, Eyre and Spottiswoode, 344 pp., characterizes, for the English reader, recent plays by Beckett, Adamov, Ionesco, Genet, Tardieu, Vian, Arrabal and Pinget, and some non-French writers; he analyses with clarity and restraint their methods (e.g. the disintegration of 'characters'), and intentions (an 'inner logic' revealing the predicament of man, and perhaps leading to a 'genuine religious quest'). New light is thrown on some of the more difficult plays; a useful bibl. is added. Some special aspects of modern drama are studied in the following: Vera G. Lee, Relationships in the modern French theatre is a Boston Ph.D. (summary in DisA, xxiii, 4, 1367), tracing the new co-operation between author, actor and director. The writer has derived some material from J.-L. Barrault. J. Lusseyran,' La France, laboratoire dramatique', FR, xxxv, 2, 1961, sketches the contribution of Jarry, Apollinaire, Vitrac, Neveux, and Ionesco, and suggests that their 'absurdity' and pessimism are incidental to their common objective, to shake the audience?a sort of 'alert'. Edith Melcher, 'The use of words in contemp. French theater', MLN, lxxvii, 5, collects evidence that Claudel, Giraudoux and Audiberti consciously used devices to obtain compulsively a non intellectual response in the hearer. Less convincing suggestions are made about later dramatists who are sceptical of the power of words, but represent 'thought in its pre-conscious stage'. 6. Poetry This year has seen the publication of few general studies on poetry, and anthologies are confined to Seghers' 'Poetes d'aujourd'hui' series which gives a new Char, an Ernie and a Spire. Anna Balakian's Surrealism: the road to the absolute, Noonday Press, 1959, 209 PP-&gt; a continuation of her Lit. Origins of Sur realism, is written in a similar fluent and readable vein, and con tains studies on Baudelaire, Lautreamont, Saint-Pol-Roux, Apolli naire, Reverdy, Aragon and filuard, together with useful chapters on the influence of Freud and Hegel. Refs are often omitted and sometimes the terminology lacks precision; but on the whole the book provides a sound conspectus for the non-specialist, however lacking in nuances. J.-L. Bedouin in Vingt ans de surrealisme, 1939-1959, Denoel, 1961, 327 pp., has undertaken a task which can only be called</page><page sequence="8">144 French Studies 'ingrat'. He faithfully refers to A. Breton as the sole arbiter of orthodoxy and enthusiastically, if not critically, presents the master's point of view. The value and interest of the book lie in its account of publs, meetings of surrealists, travels, declarations and attitudes, not only in France but in many, often remote, parts of the world. The lack of adequate refs will disappoint the research worker, who might otherwise have made use of some of the factual material. R. Derche Quatre mythes poetiques, SEDES, 199 pp., is for students in 'propedeutique', and treats the myths of GEdipus, Narcissus, Psyche and the Lorelei with refs to various authors. The reader will notice a comparison of Apollinaire's 'La Loreley' with Brentano's treatment of the same theme. In Humor as a poetic technique from Musset to Prevert, a Colorado Ph.D. (sum mary in DisA, xxii, 10, 3662), Anne G. Greet treats verbal play and puns in Laforgue, Apollinaire and Prevert. Apollinaire ' echoes the symbolists' and ' attempts cubist and surrealist effects '. Prevert 'bases whole poems upon complicated patterns of pho nemes and distinctions in meaning'. Renee Riese-Hubert, 'Le langage de la peinture dans le poeme en prose contemporain', RSH, 105, takes up an observation about earlier prose poetry (e.g. Bertrand) in order to see how far authors have continued to describe products of the plastic arts. Claudel, filuard, Reverdy all appear to use either art terms, or?more frequently?describe the objects of vision, introspective or external: in Reverdy it is often a 'look' directed from elsewhere. All these authors are shown to share the preoccupations of their painter friends. This interesting study suggests lines of investigation in stylistics and in the relationship of poetry to the plastic arts. Fiorella S. Turbeville in Surrealist theories of lit., an Indiana Ph.D. (summary in DisA, xxi, 9, 2724), selects five -isms: futurism, expressionism, activism, dadaism, surrealism, and defines each one. They have in common 'revolt against reality' and an 'intuitive and constructive vision of the artist'. C. Vigee's Revoke et Louanges, Corti, 221 pp., takes its title from a central chap, dealing with the contrasting attitudes of revolt and 'louanges' in French poetic sensibility from 1944 to 1958. There are refs to a host of poets incl. Char, Queneau, Prevert, Becker. Contemp. poetry differs from its predecessors by maintaining the tension of the dialectic of life and death, affirmation and negation, poetry and silence, exile and</page><page sequence="9">The Twentieth Century H5 &lt;enracinement,, instead of accentuating only one pole of the dialectic. Other chapters provide excellent backgrounds to the position of poetry in the 20th c.: one shows the dominant themes of existentialism in poetry since Romanticism, another follows the metamorphoses in ideas of reality and in the theme of nihilism in European poetry. We also find in this excellent book a study of Perse's search for 'l'origine'. 7. Authors alain. MF, cccxlv, 1186, gives some 'Pages de journal' by A., mainly on 1949, an art. with anecdotes about A. at Lorient, and a list of items by A. publ. in the MF. G. Beneze, Genereux A., PUF, xi + 239 PP-&gt; uses the word 'genereux' in a Cartesian sense (Robert says ' vieilli'), but the main aim of the book is to insist that A. is a philosopher in his own right, not merely a teacher and moralist; 103 chapters characterize his moral, economic and political ideas, and views on science, religion and aesthetics; there are some acute remarks on Valery, chap. 89, 90, and reminiscences of A.'s classroom methods. E. Demont, in 'A. mon maitre', MF, cccxlv, 1182, also recalls an aspect of A.'s teaching, and his favourite authors. Suzanne Dewit, A., essai de bibl.y 1893-juin 1961, Brussels, Commission beige de bibl., 1961, vi + xv + 204 pp., gives invaluable and almost complete lists of works by and about A.: over n50 items. M. Savin, En Bretagne avec A., MF, 64 pp. anouilh. Becket, ed. W. D. Howarth, Harrap, 160 pp., has a useful introd. A Pittsburgh doctoral thesis, by E. Frere, J.A.y moraliste (summary in DisA, xxii, n), insists that A. is a moralist because the presentation of the 'objectionable aspects of human conditions and conduct' implies moral lessons. M. Sachs, 'Notes on the theatricality of J.A.'s Antigone\ FRy xxxvi, 1, shows that A.'s three Greek plays, 1941-6, were experiments in Tart d'accom moder les classiques'; his Antigone takes a middle way. W. M. Schuyler, 'A. and the Commedia dell'Arte', i?LC, xxxvi, 1, shows that A. did not derive his minor stock characters from Marivaux or Moliere, and suggests that A. improved on the 'Commedia' models. apollinaire. Poemesy 'Livre de poche' is introd. by A. Billy. G.A.y le cubisme et Vesprit nouveau, Minard, 112 pp., ed. by M. Decaudin, is an attempt to launch an annual publ. in the style of 10 MLS</page><page sequence="10">146 French Studies 'Les Amis de.. . \ This vol. incl. an excellent art. by L. Breunig, 'A. et le cubisme', which demonstrates by many textual refs that A. was no blind partisan of cubism but was rather temperamentally unsympathetic to it. Scott Bates in '"Les Collines", dernier testament d'A.', after a close study of form and matter, ascribes the poem to the period 1916-18. A useful select bibl., 1956-61, brings up to date M. Decaudin's previous 1952-5 bibl. publ. in Le Flaneur des deux rives. Z. Markiewicz, ' Les attaches polonaises d'A.', RLC, xxxvi, 1, comments on Warnier's thesis that A. was a grandson of l'Aiglon and recommends closer study of A.'s prose work rather than exploration of the 'imperiar hypothesis. M. Pavlovic, in an unconvincing art. presented by P. M. Adema, 'Lafcadio Wluiki and G.A.', MF, 1184, indicates similarities of origin, family, life and temperament between A. and Gide's creation, also between A. and Protos. arland. J. Duvignaud, A., Gallimard, 304 pp., follows the usual scheme of the ' Bibl. Ideale'; the biog. section affords scraps of information, e.g. A.'s meeting with Drieu; the essay on A.'s work suggests the causes of his pessimism and praises his contri butions to lit., but does not elucidate A.'s theory of 'la grace d'ecrire'; as usual, the docs and illus. are invaluable: Gallimard must have a very well organized press and information bureau. beckett. Ruby Cohn, 'Comment c'est', FR, xxxv, 6, May, suggests interpretations of some of B.'s private symbols, without recourse to mysticism; and also lines for future research. Ead., S.B.: the comic gamut, a Washington Ph.D. (summary in DisA, xxi, 9, 1961, 2711-12), indicates radical changes in B.'s attitude, seen through his comic notations, from early conventional forms to the latest trilogy with its grotesque 'dialogue between man and his fictions'. F.J.Hoffman, S.B.: the Language of Self, Southern Illinois U.P., xii+i77pp., discusses, for the American general reader, the place of B. in the trend towards introspection, with ref. to Freud, Dostoevsky, Kafka, and even 'Miss Sarraute'; mainly to 'explicate' B.'s presentation of Proust, Molloy and Malone; index; but footnotes transferred to a hide-out. H. Kenner, S.B.: a Critical Study, New York, Grove Press, 1961, 208 pp., supplies many interesting interpretations on precise points, incl. the recurrence of certain notations (arithmetic, bicycles, hats, etc.); rather cryptic, well written, and modestly profiting from meetings with B., who let him use three unpubl. (rejected) works. Judith J.</page><page sequence="11">The Twentieth Century 147 Radke, Doubt and the disintegration of Form. S.B., in a Colorado Ph.D. (summary in DisAy xxii, 9, 3205), concludes that B.'s characters not only demonstrate ' the inauthentic theatricalism of life', and the useless effort to find the authentic, but that B. renders his characters, the plot, place and time radically imprecise and unreal also. bernanos. Two periodicals now publ. work on B.: (1) Bull, de la Soc. des Amis de G.B., since 1949, supplies unpubl. items, corr., and biog. and bibl. material, and announcements of work in progress (n State doctorates, and 10 other theses in France alone, up to Oct. 1961); no. 42 of the bull, is on the Dialogue des Carme lites; and (2) Etudes bernanosiennes, Minard, no. 2 of which is no. 67-8 of RLMod, 'hiver 1961-2', 126 pp. The general title of this no. is Autour du 'Journal d'un cure de campagne\ and there are 4 items, incl. an excellent 'genesis' of the book by M. Esteve, and an analysis of B.'s expression of the supernatural?litotes, special uses of glances, or of the hands, metaphors involving beasts of prey, etc.; some draft notes by A. Beguin are reprinted, on B.'s use of animal metaphors. Minard also publ. UHerne, cahiersparaissant deux fois Van; no. 1 was on R.-G.

Travers, and bibl. refs by M. Esteve, etc.; there are also seven items by B. A useful conspectus of recent work is by the enthusiast M. Esteve, 'Des regards neufs sur B.', TR, 178. W. Bush, Souffranee et expiation dans la pensee de B., Minard, 210 pp., notes a change, in later years, in B.'s views as seen through his novels, etc.: the notion of suffering became less acceptable; his orthodoxy is discussed and defended. G. Gaucher, G.B. ou Vinvincible esperance, Plon, vi+181 pp., again judges and admires B. from a Catholic standpoint; but B.'s 'spiritual evolution' is provided with biog. facts, and page refs, regarding B.'s health, poverty and generosity; there is a page of graphological hindsight, and a bibl. with useful comments. Lea Moch, La Saintete dans les romans de G.B., Les Belles Lettres, 132 pp., summarizes portions of the novels, from a Catholic standpoint, without searching much farther; the short book list has one item after 1954. Bernard (j.-J.). A Columbia Ph.D. thesis by L. O. Bishop, The Dramatic Work ofJ.J.B. (summary in DisA, xxii, n, 4010) seems to cover the essential topics. 10-2</page><page sequence="12">148 French Studies butor. Two interviews given by B. contribute to the present discussions on the novel. One, 'La lit., aujourd'hui, iv', Tel Quel, 11, concerns B.'s relation with the 'new* novelists, and his projects for future work, mainly non-fiction. The other, 'Entretien avec M.B.', by F. C. St Aubin, in FR, xxxvi, 1, Oct., is an unrehearsed, simplified explanation, as at May 18, i960, of the technique applied, e.g., in Etnploi du temps; B. refers to Camus, and to the influence of Mallarme, Husserl and Heidegger (rather than of Sartre). P. Deguise, 'M.B. et le "nouveau roman"', FR, xxxv, 2, Dec, sketches various methods by which B. tries to probe modes of consciousness of the present and the past; B.'s approach is likened to that of Mallarme, and contrasted with Proust's. F. C. St Aubyn, 'M.B. and phenomenological realism', SFr, 16, sees existentialism at every turn, and finds in the four novels a predict able progress towards some theory of illusionism; B.'s choice of names (Milan, Revel, Blaise) is thought to be significantly multi valent (a fish, reveal, a lisp, etc.), and various other rapid conclusions ought to be treated with caution. L. Spitzer. ' Quelques aspects de la technique des romans de M.B. (continued)', ArL, xiv, 1, examines especially La Modification, and contrasts it with Passage de Milan. In the former, two currents are distinguished, an external time-sequence, and the inner 'vous' of Leon, the one reacting (through 'ces gens,.. .ces objets et ces images') on the other. In the earlier novel, the infiltration of stage-directions is examined. Other techniques are noted?use of tenses, inversion, ritual phrases; and a contrast is pointed out in the use of apposition and of 'vous' in the two novels. camus.

Behaviour</page><page sequence="13">The Twentieth Century 149 ist and analytical descriptions lead to the creation of a 'monde etrange \ Finally the author shows that although C. was distrustful of language, he respected lit. tradition, and was not only a philo sopher but also a novelist. C. B. Brockman, 4 Metamorphosis of Hell: the spiritual quandary in La Chute \ FR&gt; xxxv, 4, is a rather loose art. discussing freedom and hell with refs to and comparisons with Dostoevsky, Dante, Eliot, C. S. Lewis and Shaw. The duality in Jean-Baptiste apparently saves him from being com pletely lost. A. J. L. Busst's 'Notes on the eccentric christology of C, FSy xvi, 1, purports to show an identity of type between Meursault and the historical Jesus. It is difficult to see the validity of some of the analogies (e.g. the scene on the beach before the killing allegedly resembles the Transfiguration). Anne Durand's Le Cas A.C., Fischbacher, 204 pp., 1961, is mainly an unsym pathetic and tendentious biog. which, in the author's words, ' n'est pas ecrit pour les ignorants'. There is little attempt to give a serious account of C.'s works; but rather a desire to dismiss, not to discuss. U?tr anger is simply a 'dissertation en forme de recit'! In A.C.: 'La Peste\ Arnold, 64 pp., D. R. Haggis discusses against the background of L'fitranger the genesis, the image, structure and style of the work, indicates the difficulty of giving any one interpretation of the 'peste' image and is of the opinion that the characters, because they are vehicles of metaphysical specula tion, lack the veracity of the creations of the great novelists. La P. is not a great novel because, instead of reflecting life, it teaches what life is. C. G. Hill, 'C. and Vigny', PMLA, lxxvii, 1, draws analogies between C.'s and V.'s early lives and experiences, quotes ideas in C. claimed to be parallel or reminiscent of V.'s, and examines their common indebtedness to the Greeks. This is a cogent, well-prepared article. Adele King attempts in 'Structure and meaning in La Chute\ PMLA, lxxvii, 5, to clarify La C by discussing its relationship to Dante and to UHomme revoke, and by uncovering hidden allusions to C.'s controversy with Sartre and Jeanson, after the publication of UHomme r. The first part of H. Lausberg's Interpretationen dramatischer Dichtungen, 1, Munich, Max Hueber, 240 pp., dis cusses the characters and the notion of revolt in Les Justes and concludes that the atmosphere in C.'s work is one of 'humanitas naturaliter Christiana'.

Nguyen-Van-Huy's La Metaphysique du bonheur chez C, Neuchatel, La Baconniere, xvii + 249pp., gives an excellent account of C.'s metaphysics, supported by a wide knowledge and understanding of philosophy, and constitutes a major contribution to C. studies. The whole of C.'s work is seen to move from a partial to a complete 'bonheur', from a 'bonheur' of union with ' L'?tre-dans-le-monde', towards that of union with ' L'fitre-dans l'homme', culminating in universal unity. There are many refs to and comparisons with J. Huxley, Teilhard de Char din and especially Plotinus and buddhist metaphysics. The bibl. is rather short and the notes are unfortunately placed at the end of chapters. Rima D. Reck!s 'A.C.: the artist and his time', MLQ, xxiii, 2, is a brief mise aupoint of C.'s refusal to subordinate human values to creativity and to history. In ' A.C., stone-mason', MLN, lxxvii, 3, W. Strauss follows C.'s thought from Noces to La Pierre quipousse, explaining the dialectic of sea, sun and earth on one side and prison, exile and death on the other in terms of dynamic stone-images. In a careful and undogmatic art., F. C. StAubyn, 'A.C. and the death of the other', FS, xvi, 2, explains the presence and death of the other in seven of C.'s major works from Caligula to La Chute in the light of Sartre's analyses of the 'pour-autrui'. The meeting point of the two authors, it is suggested, is the following remark by S.: 'La mort de l'autre me constitue comme objet irremediable, exactement comme ma propre mort.' Society's elimination of Meursault is seen, for example, to reflect its desire to rid itself of being-as-object-for-others. T. Ziolkowski, in 'A.C. and H. Boll', MLN&gt; lxxvii, 3, points at affinities between C.'s liberal humanism and B.'s practical Christianity, although he denies any lit. influence of C. on B. Both are moralists, 'sentimentalische Dichter', preoccupied with the discrepancy between the real and the ideal: both are ' revokes' and severe critics of their society.

Histoire cTune amitie..., Perrin, 315 pp., written and compiled under the name of Sorella, presents unpubl. texts by R.

The 4th vol. of the 'Carriers P.C, C. diplomate, Gallimard, 365 pp., celebrates C.'s career mainly by means of texts by C. relating in turn to his various appointments (places and political personalities), but there is nothing resembling a diary; P. Moreau characterizes C.'s action and attitude, and there is a chronology by J. C. Berton. W. Arnold, ' Grundformen europaischer Dramatik bei C, ZFSL, lxii, 3/4, distinguishes three broad types of dramatic theory, and concludes that C. turned all three to good account. G. Poulet, in Metamorphoses du cercle, Plon, 1961, vi-f xxxi-f 525 pp., deals with C. in chap, xvn, as part of an evolution from medieval thought; by means of nearly 100 quotations, C. is made to appear radically circle-minded?the circle being seen in various approximate equivalencies, though not all so precisely round as Emma Bovary's plate, adduced in another chapter. E. Trepanier, ' L'hispanisme dans le theatre de C, RLC, xxxvi, 3, suggests how C. reflects i6th-c. Spanish drama, in its religious exigency, without textual borrowings. cocteau. Le Cordon ombilical, souvenirs, Plon, x + 85 pp., has some biog. facts without apparent significance, together with notes and reflections on various topics, particularly artistic creation.

The same writer's 'Imagery in Cheri and La Fin de Cheri: taste and smell', FS, xvi, 3, shows C. using food and odours to suggest character and mood, and to reveal the progress in the downfall of Cheri. drieu. F. Grover, D.L.R., Gallimard, 'Bibl. Ideale', 354 pp., follows the customary scheme of the coll. with its excellent bibl.

Lettres de Jeunesse avec des poemes inedits, Seghers, 223 pp., coll. by Mme C. Valette-E. and presented and annotated by R. D. Valette, offers a selection of 118 out of 195 letters of t5. to his parents and to A. J. Gonon written between 1911 and 1919. The vol. gives a wealth of biog. information from which emerges a picture of the early development of the poet. There is also an interesting iconography. Europe, xl, 403-4, is devoted entirely to fi. and comprises 33 items incl. poems by E., ' temoignages' from Abraham, Emmanuel, etc., critical essays on imagery and vocabu lary, a chronology and a biog. Emmanuel. In a long and illuminating article, 'L'evolution des symboles dans la poesie de P.E.', Ecrits du Canada Frangais, xiii, 1962, Eva Kusher shows E.'s debt to Jouve and Jung, distinguishes his use of symbols from that of Baudelaire, Rimbaud and the Surrealists, and traces the evolution through 4 ' etapes': ' lyrisme mythique', 'la guerre et la resistance', 'mythes collectifs' and the period of Le Versant de Vdge. In the final stage E. abandons vast mythical frescoes, and his symbols become more deeply rooted in reality. gide. Marie Dormoy, 'Madeleine Gide', MF, cccxlv, 1186, follows M.G.'s reactions throughout her married life with some facts and some speculation. The author shows both sympathy for M. and understanding of G. L. Gagnebin, A.G. nous interroge, essai critique sur sa pensee religieuse et morale, Lausanne, Cahiers de la Renaissance Vaudoise, 1961, 174 pp., gives a rapid account of the subject from a Protestant standpoint. There is much talk of G.'s sincerity, apparent more in his novels than in the 'Journal',</page><page sequence="17">The Twentieth Century 153 but no effort to define the concept. This study, supported by abundant quotations without refs, finishes on an appeal for Christian ' engagement'. In a clear-sighted art.,' G.'s Caves du Vatican and the illusionism of the novel', MLN, lxxvii, 3, W. Holdheim examines the para doxical relationship between freedom and necessity in Lafcadio (who has no real psychology) and goes on to a fine analysis of the novel and reality. The G. of the Caves is the opposite of the image of the artist praised in his Dostoevsky lectures. The author defines (erroneously?) the 'caves' as 'systems'. Surely the 'caves' are what underlie the systems. Elizabeth R. Jackson in ' The evane scent world of the Faux-Monnayeurs\ S, xvi, 2, attempts to solve the contradiction between the apparent reality and elusiveness of the world of F.-M. in the light of her discovery of similarities of instability, mobility, metamorphosis and predominance of decor, between this novel and the Baroque world. The author concludes that the elusiveness is true to a 20th-c. vision and is aesthetically pleasing. A. Naville, Bibl. des ecrits de A.G. (depuis 1891 jusqu'en 1952), Guy le Prat, 238 pp., is substantially a reprint of the 1949 ed. with seven pages of 'Complement Bibl. (1949-1952)'. Some mis prints, e.g. ' Seeker-Warburg' for Seeker and Warburg. In a well documented thesis, A.G. LEvolution de sapensee religieuse, Nizet, 295 pp., Catharine H. Savage treats the subject (from which she rightly excludes G.'s moral preoccupations) from his childhood down to Thesee, 'contempteur des dieux', and thus attempts to fill an important gap in G. studies. The book excels throughout in clarity and in the later chapters in subject-matter. One feels that a more penetrating study of the early works from Andre Walter to La Porte etroite would have revealed the essence of G.'s religious thought which, as the author points out,' repugne a toute synthese'. Here perhaps is the whole problem, and the author's unwillingness to examine dialectical patterns in G. and to define 'religion' more broadly prevents this competent work from adequately filling the gap.

No page refs; bibl. to 1958. P. R. Robert, J.G. et les techniques du roman, UCPMP, 1961, x+i07pp., amply compensates for a doctrinaire analysis of the content of a novel by presenting many valuable observations of the techniques creating this content (roughly: the reader's consciousness of the characters; things and persons treated spatially, and their actions in time); the more or less rapid changes in G.'s preoccupations are shown?not amount ing to the distinct ' manieres' alleged by critics?and the growing richness of the techniques. Misprints, but a good book list, up to 1957. M. A. Smith, 'G.'s cycle of the Hussard novels', FR, xxxv, 3, Jan., profits from personal contact with G., and reviews the six novels (incl. Pauline, not yet publ.), discussing also Bonheur fou as a stylistic experiment, and G.'s reflection of Merimee and Stendhal. giraudoux. A Pittsburgh Ph.D., by J. T. Coleman, Le monde illusoire de J.G. (summary in DisA9 xxii, 10, 3657), relates the themes of ten plays to their language and style, treating, e.g., comparisons, imagery, ambiguity, anachronism, as procedures to juxtapose 'reality and imagination'. L. LeSage, J.G., his life and works, Pennsylvania State U.P., 1959, viii + 238 pp., should receive a belated word of gratitude for a useful and well documented presentation of G.'s life, themes and ideas, with hints on stylistic matters and a rev. of the critical reaction up to 1956. Gratitude cannot be extended to the printer, who discourages the reader from using the interesting notes. Edith Melcher, 'The use of words in contemp. French theater', MLN, lxxvii, 5, suggests that G.'s plays contain certain emotionally charged words, which are key-words ('trahir' in Ondine); this observation is worth following up. ionesco.

Ralston, G.M.'s paradoxical expression of mystery: a stylistic study of 'La Soif, CUASRL, 1961, viii+102 pp., is a part only of an unpubl. Ph.D. thesis, which dealt with five plays. The writer does not need to apologize for his definitions of terms; the clear exposition successfully unravels M.'s intentions (showing the irrational modes of understanding fellow beings) in a 'puzzling* play, by way of certain stylistic notations. M. appears to have successfully differentiated his characters by their variant use of paradox, irony, sarcasm, metaphor, etc. There are two works on M.'s theories: Sister M. A.

Y. Belaval, 'Introd. a la poesie experimentale', Crit, xviii, 186, describes the various states M. experiences under the influence of mescaline and the stages of his search for the absolute, which, the writer suggests, is not to be found beyond appearances, but in the permanency of consciousness. Genevieve Bonnefoi, 'H.M. ou le demon de la connaissance', LNouv, n.s., 19, 1961, recounts M.'s experience under the influence of drugs in Connais sance par les gouffres. Synaesthesia (the word is not actually used) is said to be one form of 'la brusque concretisation de l'abstrait'. In a clear art.'

His quest for a higher reality is constantly thwarted when reality, magic or nightmare replace authentic mysticism. Techniques of self-perfection are 'immunisa tion', 'identification' and metamorphosis. W.

Bona Mondini, in M. du cote de 'Port RoyaV, Debresse, 160 pp., traces the Jansenist element in M. to his early years, examines the sources and gives a detailed study of the play against the historical setting. P. de Saint-Robert, 'M. ou le voyage au bout du jour', 77?, 169, on reading Un Voyageur solitaire, recognizes at 35 years' distance the same M., although his thought and judgement of self have changed. R. H. Sisler, H. de M. and Youth, in a Pittsburgh Ph.D. (summary in DisA, xxiii, 3, 1023-4) proposes to account for M.'s views of what youth should be?i.e., a reaction against mediocrity and against parents, by way of sport and war, etc.?through M.'s mysogyny, egocentricity and pessimism. peguy. The Feuillets and Cahiers de Vamitie CP. continue. The geographer R. Blanchard, in Ma Jeunesse sous Vaile de P., Fayard, 1961, 245 pp., recounts in lively fashion the compulsive pressure P. brought to bear on his friends, and gives new biog. facts, especially for 1891-1900 (lycee d'Orleans to ficole Normale Superieure). F. Brunet, La Morale de CP., Moulins, fids des Cahiers Bourbonnais; Paris, Voisin, 83 pp., addresses P. himself, lyrically, in a style resembling P.'s; nevertheless, he competently traces P.'s ideas (Dreyfus, socialism, disillusion, 'civisme', heroism), attempting to harmonize them. The broad accuracy of this account is confirmed by the conclusions of Blanchard and Isaac. By way of contrast, H. Guillemin, 'P. et Jaures', TM, xviii, 194, faces us with P.'s change of attitude, from 1900 to 1913, towards Jaures?from praise to an invitation to guillotine him: Maurras was hardly less provocative. P.'s ingratitude to L. Herr is also brought out, and it is implied that the family is avoiding the publ. of certain MSS. J. Isaac, 'P. et les Cahiers de la Quinzaine (1903 4)', CS, liv, 369, Dec. 1962/Jan. 1963, recalls his observations regarding a change in P., at the time of the 4th ser. of the Cahiers, a1 glissement': the disappointed subscribers received less socialism, more unworthy polemics and more lit. material. It is suggested that some other polemical writings have remained unpubl. Nelly Jussem-Wilson, 'L'Affaire Jeanne d'Arc et l'Affaire Dreyfus...', RHLF, lxii, 3, makes excellent reflections on the critics of 1910, who misinterpreted P.'s Notre jeunesse as an answer to D. Halevy's Apologie pour notre passe, rather than a defence of his Jeanne d'Arc: P. was accused of recanting his 'dreyfusisme',</page><page sequence="21">The Twentieth Century 157 but his reply is equivocal, since it tried to spare anti-humanist Christians, whilst attacking anti-Christian humanists. The same writer contributes 'P. et ses premiers commentateurs d'outre Manche', RLC, xxxvi, 1, contrasting the praise for P. of English critics in 1910-18 with the ensuing silence; this is connected with English incomprehension of the Dreyfus affair. J. Onimus continues to write voluminously on P. His Introd. aux trots 'Mysteres' de P., Minard, 'Cahiers de l'amitie CP.', 94 pp., is a well-documented analysis of these works (set for the agregation)?their history, composition, themes, and 'spiritual significance', omitting lit. and stylistic aspects. Incidentally we hear that the 'caracterologiste' would classify P. as a 'tempera ment a forte secondarite'. The introd. is a useful annotated bibl. by A. Martin. In conjunction with this work, an art. by J. Onimus should be taken: 'Les sources de la Jeanne d'Arc de P.', RHLF, lxii, 3, which concludes that P. in this work of 1896, unlike other playwrights, does not falsify any 'evenement reel'. J. Onimus has also provided, for the general reader, La Route de CP., Plon, viii + 207pp., announced as a 'psycho-portrait', but in fact a history of P.'s opinions and dilemmas, his conversion, his attitude to Bergson, Sorel and Pascal, about which much more remains to be said; the Cahiers are neglected, but a chronology, a short annotated bibl., and a regrettable graphological note, are added. N. Wilson, 'Ernst Stadler and CP_', MLR, lvii, 4, investigates thoroughly a fictitious meeting between the two in 1914, and discusses S.'s respectful attitude to P. before the war. perse. J. Charpier, S.-J.P., Gallimard, 'Bibl. Ideale', 301 pp., conforms to the usual scheme of the series, incl. a study of the work; concluding that the originality of P.'s language lies in a synthesis of traditional elements, together with a surpassing of tradition. The author is sensitive to P.'s poetics and to his use of vocabulary. M. Maxence;' S.-J.P., ou la tentation de la demesure', Tel Quel, 4, after a study of 'le regard' in P.'s work sees in Chronique not only the bankruptcy of' emerveillement methodique', but also a kind of lit. which has become its own parody. The refuge which P. seeks in style is interpreted as a sign of decadence. ' Les themes poeti ques de S.-J.P. dans Chronique', Bulletin des Jeunes Romanistes, 6, by Monique Parent, examines the intermingling of the themes of earth, man and time.

Allamand, Ce que P. rCa pas dit, Scorpion, 1961, 123 pp., has no refs and some misprints and comprises more or less scurrilous anecdotes about supposed models for La Recherche. This book can be of little interest to the serious scholar. In a Ph.D. thesis for Columbia Univ., P.'s nocturnal muse: dreams (summary in DisA, xxi, 9, 1961), W. Bell analyses dreams of different types without recourse to psychoanalytical techniques. Their function in the novel, like that of the involuntary memory, is to convince Marcel of the unity of his ' moi'. H. Bonnet's excellent Alphonse Darlu, mattre dephilosophie de M.P., Nizet, 1961, 136 pp., gives a clear and well-documented account of D.'s rationalist idealism and of his influence at Condorcet. There are interesting comparisons between D. and Beulier in Jean Santeuil, also z un publ. letters, one to D., the other to A. France. In a study of Contre Sainte-Beuve, M. Bonnet makes a careful assessment of Fallois' ed., and shows that in addition to foreshadowing in this early work some of the characters for his main work, P. also gives its central theme which is 'le bonheur'. Contre S.-B. reflects a 'crise d'anti-intellectualisme' for which A la Recherche... was later to compensate. The Bull, de la Soc. des Amis de M.P., no. 12, has an unpubl. letter, some 'poemes de jeunesse' presented by Elizabeth Jackson, and 5 articles, incl. 'Le comique de M.P. (II)' by M. Suzuki. P., the Critic Novelist, by Marlene C. Foote, a Texas Ph.D. (summary in DisA, xxiii, 1), maintains that lit. criticism is an essential part of A la Recherche.... P.: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. by R. Girard, Prentice-Hall, iv+185 pp., brings together some outstanding contributions (in English or transl. from the French) to P. studies, among them an unpubl. art. by R. Macksey, 'Architecture of time: dialectics and structure'. Admit ting his debt to Poulet, the author, with many refs to the great philosophers, indicates dialectical patterns (inside/outside, hero/</page><page sequence="23">The Twentieth Century 159 anti-hero, 'je'/'autre') and gives an interesting account of circular patterns connected with Combray and Swann. R. Girard, Mensonge poetique et verite romanesque, Grasset, 1961, 315 pp., has 2 chapters on P. The first is a brilliant analysis of the taboos and rites of various * mondes clos' in La Recherche. Com bray is shown to have 'en puissance' the faults of the salons. The second chap, analyses the style of P. and Dostoevsky. These studies show a knowledge of recent sociological thought. M. Hindus, A Reader's Guide to M.P., Noonday, x + 275 pp., gives a synopsis of La Recherche and other works, suggesting doubtful affinities (e.g. P. and Wilkie Collins). The 'textual commentary' on the episode of the party at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's is uninformative and lacks the rigour of 'explication de textes'. W. Hodson, 'P.'s methods of character presentation in Les Plaisirs et les jours and Jean Santeuil', MLR, lvii, 1, traces to P.'s early work his multi lateral approach to characters, their development in time, his techniques of the hidden observer and of the revelation of un expected traits. With his use of first person narrative, prefigured in his Contre Sainte-Beuve, P. finds the right tone and approach. J. P. Houston, 'Temporal patterns in A la Recherche...', FS, xvi, 1, is a penetrating account of P.'s narrative technique, showing his rejection of the linear time of Flaubert and the Naturalists, his delicate use of the imperfect and past historic tenses and the importance of weather and seasons to convey the correlation between inner and real time. R. Macksey, 'M.P. and the "Chant d'un Rossignol"; an unpubl. letter', MLN, lxxvii, 5: in a letter to Mrs J. W. Garrett, P. admits that she inspired the comparison of the Princesse de Luxembourg's voice to the song of the nightingale. Margaret Mein, P.'s Challenge to Time, MUP, x+144 pp., in luscious style suggests 'rapprochements' and 'parentes d'esprit'. Flaubert's 'emotion renouvelee' and P.'s 'temps retrouve' appear to be similar, but the comparison of Baudelaire's 'dandysme' with 'snobisme' is less convincing and any recurrence of 'vaporisation' and 'centralisation' deserves a more detailed and thorough exami nation. Refs are sporadic. In a chap, of Laure Riese's Les Salons lit. du Second Empire a nos jours, Toulouse, Privat, the reader will find short histories of 'les salons autour de P.', sketches of their ladies, names of 'habitues', etc. R. T. Riva's 'Death and Immortality in the works of M.P.', FR, xxv, 5, is a straightforward mise au point.

A serious attempt is being made to go beyond the statements of R.-G. himself, in order to find his aims and significance. The following are some of the contributions. G. Genette, 'Sur R.-G.', Tel Quel, 8, is a trenchant discussion of the degree of 'subjectivity' (i.e. presentation of matter only as the author thinks the characters see it) in the novels?in view of Marienbad where subjectivity seems to be the aim; the suggestion is made that it is an impossible aim. The use of tenses in Les Gommes is adduced as evidence. Yvonne Guers,' La technique romanesque chez A.R.-G.', FR, xxxv, 6, May, also discusses 'subjectivity', perhaps less cogently, and differently defined; a 'subjective' time is discovered; it is suggested incidentally that Le Labyrinthe may be an allegory, in spite of R.-G. B. Morrissette is proposing to publ. a work on R.-G., and in the meantime writes on certain aspects. 'De Stendhal a R.-G.: modalites du "point de vue"', CAEF, 14, suggests that the under lying problem is an ontological one?to explain what is alleged to be seen; the techniques used, such as mirror repetitions and the restricted (subjective?) 'point de vue', are traced in recent novels. The same writer, in 'Theory and practice in the works of R.-G.', MLN, lxxvii, 3, suggests that R.-G.'s pronouncements of 1953-6 are not inconsistent with those of 1961?the early insistence on an 'objectal' viewpoint, 'scenes figees', and a non-metaphysical and non-anthropomorphic interpretation of a novel, can be maintained alongside the human significance of objects, which are the 'modus operandi' of emotions. A specific application of these theories is worked out in ' Clefs pour Les Gommes\ pp. 267-314 of a reprint of Les Gommes, Plon, 315 pp., in which B. Morrissette traces the complicated notations which R.-G. has introd. into the novel, 'fonde sur un jeu de reflets, de decalages, de dedoublements', and e.g. the (Edipus legend, the riddle, and the Ancien Tarot de Marseille. The contributions of B. Morrissette are convincing and fortified by bibl. refs. B. Pingaud, 'La technique de la description dans le jeune roman d'aujourd'hui', CAEF, 14, refers mainly to R.-G., and to ten</page><page sequence="25">The Twentieth Century 161 dencies rather than techniques; these novels reveal a human mind fascinated by objects, not the converse, as in Balzac, where signi ficant objects lead to persons. B. F. Stoltzfus, 'A novel of objective subjectivity: Le Voyeur by A.R.-G.', PMLA, lxxvii, 4, i, Sept., uses a term, 'objective subjectivity', already in MLN (above), and ably argues that the novel is subjective in content, since the reader is forced to accept the story through the obsessive mind of Mathias; this is said to initiate a new naturalism based on Freudian determinism. This art. incl. some useful bibl. refs. S. S. Weiner, in 'A look at techniques and meaning in R.-G.'s Voyeur ', MLQ, xxiii, 3, 'looks at' some recurring themes (e.g. the string), but concludes that one should look at the novel as at a cubist painting, not for the story nor for any anthropomorphic significance. K. Wilhelm, 'Der "nouveau romancier" A.R.-G.', ZFSL, lxxii, 3/4, discusses broadly the new ideas, especially those of R.-G., and provides an extensive bibl., incl. German contribu tions, up to Oct. 1961. rolland. J. B. Barrere: see under martin du gard (r). Marcelle Kempf, R.R. et VAllemagne, Debresse, 303 pp., is a thorough chronological presentation of R.'s reaction to the German nation, seen in Jean-Christophe, the corr. and the unpubl. diaries, especi ally for 1914-18; bibl. and index. J. Roos,' R.R. et Tolstoi', RLC, xxxvi, 1, shows T.'s influence to have been on lit. form, not ideas. A. Seche et R.R., Ces Jours lointains: lettres et autres ecrits, Michel, 173 pp., contains unpubl. corr.?about 90 letters from R. to S. and 20 from S. to R., 1903-39, with a gap 1920-33; S. stresses their common ideals and their loyalty, despite divergencies (e.g. in 1916 with S.'s unanswered open letter). The early letters concern the drama. Useful notes, and an index. Sorella: see under chateaubriant. sarraute. An interview: 'La lit., aujourd'hui, II', Tel Quelf 9, presents some of the author's intentions in her own words. G. Zeltner, 'N.S.', MF&gt; cccxlv, 1188, is a helpful and clear investi gation of 'more than meets the eye' in N.S.'s work; a reaction against Sartre's psycho-anthropological explanation, by which a 'realisme atroce' would be the chief ingredient. The writer invites the reader to find not only an exhibition of 'pre-language states' in the characters, but also in the author herself a sensitive intro spection, reflected imaginatively in the 'zones obscures' of the characters. 11 MLS</page><page sequence="26">French Studies sartre. M.W.Cranston, S., Oliver and Boyd, vi+n8pp., supplies the need for a short, broadly based account of S.; this survey for the general reader is worth consulting for some of the thumbnail refs to both philosophical and lit. works. The bibl. reaches 1962, and incl. transls and books about S. F. Jameson, S., the Origins of a Style, YRS, 1961, xii + 229 PP-&gt; is a difficult and important book, in which a subtle and perceptive mind seeks, intuitively, the elements (ideas, tendencies, forms) which make S. differ from all other authors. The presentation is organic, not analytical, which lends persuasion. Stylistic methods are not used. Well-chosen extracts are found to betray S.'s re iterated vision of the opposition between things and conscious ness ; this may be revealed to us directly, or through time-sequences, punctuation, mannerisms, the 'favourite and obsessive word', etc., which the sensitive reader relates together. A problem remaining is: how to take up this work oneself, deprived of F. Jameson's intui tions? His chap, of conclusions does not help. The French originals of the quotations are hidden at the end of the book; there is an index. H. Lausberg examines one play by S., Les Sequestres d'Altona, pp. 93-231 of his Interpretationen dramatischer Dichtung, 1, Munich, Hueber, and adds to his analysis a discussion of its historical and social implications, and of the notion of freedom, with ref. also to other works of S. A different aspect of S. is presented by G. Maire, in Les Instants privileges, Aubier, pp. 357-90, where the intuitions in La Nausee which might have led to the 'cure' of Roquentin, are located; the resulting liberty from anguish is described. Fro mentin, fimile Clermont, and Moreas are also dealt with in this vol. segalen. H. Bouillier, V.S., MF, 1961,422 pp., is the necessary, clear, exhaustive thesis presenting S.'s life, his lit., poetic and spiritual development, his reading, his reflection of the philosophies of the Far East, the evolution of his attitude from joy in the real, to belief in the imaginary; much on Claudel, Rimbaud, Mallarme, Huysmans and Jules de Gaultier and some stylistic remarks. A short but interesting unpubl. note on the theory of the novel is added, a good bibl. and an index. Following this thesis, MF publ. 'Lettres a H. Manceron', cccxlv, 1186, ten letters, truncated, 1909-14; and CS, liv, 368, Oct./Nov., has two important letters from S. to J. de Gaultier, 1915</page><page sequence="27">The Twentieth Century and 1917, and two articles; one, by G. Germain, suggests the need for a study of the Chinese influence, in turn, in Claudel (in China 1895-1909), on S. (1909-17), and on Perse (1914-21). valery. The involutions of V.'s thought are still unresolved. L. Bolle, 'Le poele de P.V.', Crit, xviii, 182, expounds V.'s quest for control over the transitions between sensations, images, etc., in place of the disorderly or arbitrary workings of the mind; inci dentally criticizing 'La jeune Parque' for its over-density. This art. itself is over-dense, and far more difficult to understand than V. H. and M. Charney, 'Doctor Faustus and Mon Faust: an ex cursus in dualism', S, xvi, 1, discusses the notions of individuality and duality in Mann and V., without making the terms of ref. very clear, fi. Gaede, Nietzsche et V.y Gallimard, 505 pp., is an unusual thesis, elegantly written, presenting two 'physionomies qui se repondent et s'eclairent'. This is claimed to be not on account of any influence of one on the other (such matters are ignominiously relegated to an interesting appendix), but because both indulged in the 'comedie de l'esprit' which consists in using cogitation as a means of probing the faculty of cogitation. In turn we are in structed on the divergent attitudes of N. and V. to Socrates, the role of the mind, the 'moi', chance, philosophers, civilization, Pascal, etc. We are warned against the two extreme outcomes of their thought: nationalistic misinterpretations of the one, resigned introspection in the other. There is a good bibl., but no index. The 'footnotes' are exasperatingly hidden away. Judith Robinson, 'Dreaming and the analysis of consciousness in V.'s Cahiers\ FS, xvi, 2, is another of this writer's illuminating articles, this time presenting and explaining V.'s investigations into waking and dreaming states, and into the problem of being conscious of being conscious in waking hours but not in dreams. V.'s notes in the Cahiers, i-xx, and in 'La Jeune Parque', harmonize with recent neurophysiology, and diverge from Freud. The Cahiers reveal statements more precise than those found in previously publ. works by V. A number of lit. studies on V.'s work have appeared. R. Dragonetti, in Aux Frontieres du langage poetique (etudes sur Dante, Mallarme, V.)&gt; RGand, 1961, 170 pp., studies 22 lines of 'La Jeune Parque', and the poem' Les Pas'. D. regards the tears in the first piece as evidence of a sense of tragedy, not of tension relieved as Alain thought; the two views are perhaps not as contradictory 11-2</page><page sequence="28">164 French Studies as they sound. ' Les Pas' serves as a starting-point for a discussion of rhythm, regarded not as periodicity but as a breaking of silence and a revelation of silence. Fruitful refs are made to other texts. E. Huber continues his work on V., in an art. 'Zu P.V.s Gedicht "La ceinture"', ZFSL, lxxii, 3/4, where he suggests a tentative explanation of a poem which Alain did not understand. W. N. Ince, 'P.V.?"poesie pure" or "poesie cuite"', FS, xvi, 4, admits the charge that V.'s verse is 'contrived'. He traces V.'s theory of 'poesie pure' (e.g. in the Cahiers) and asks those who grieve at the 'contrivance' to try to accept it as an incidental outcome of a coherent effort towards awareness and control. The writer shows cogently that the question at issue is not whether creative work should or should not be spontaneous. G. W. Ireland, ' Notes on the composition of "La Jeune Parque"', ZFSL, lxxii, 1/2, presents an independent investigation of V.'s procedures in com posing the poem: 'premier jet', proliferation, emendation, transfer of verses, welding. The MSS. belonging to Mme P.V., Monod, and Mondor were carefully examined; though it is made clear (even more clear than in Nadal's ed.) that a full ordering of variants will never be made. The portions specially examined in this art. are of absorbing interest, which need not be diminished by the writer's predilection, on occasion, for a theory of 'direct inspiration', nor by his ref. to his own explanations 'at once im possible and unnecessary to describe'. A linguistic and philo sophical sequel is called for. C. Roy, 'Le spectateur interesse', NRF, 115, contrasts the reader's unfavourable impression of Mon Faust with the revelation of its performance on the stage. C. G. Whiting, '"Profusion du soir" and "Le cimetiere marin"', PMLA, lxxvii, 1, Mar., analyses and appraises these poems of 1899 and 1917, showing similarities, but progress in the planning and the thought. H. Yvon, 'Les expressions negatives dans Mon Faust\ FM, xxx, 1, is a grammatical exercise, comparing for each con struction V.'s usage with that of Old French. No stylistic conclusions are drawn (is every omission of 'ne' with 'pas' a colloquialism?).</page></plain_text>
