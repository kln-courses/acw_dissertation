<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading Zoos: Representations of Animals in Captivity. By Randy Malamud. New York: NYU P, 1998. xi + 377 pp. On the subject of animals in literature, one of the most memorable passages in the English language is surely Jack London's depiction of Buck, the dog-hero of The Call of the Wild: "And when, on the still cold night, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolf like, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him" (26). Readers of Randy Mala- mud's book on the literature of animals confined in zoos will often hear a very different call of the wild, such as that recorded in John Irving's Set- ting Free the Bears: "I heard a wail from some lost aisle of the Small Mam- mal Maze. A cry cut off at full force, as if O. Schrutt [the night watchman] had flung open a door on some poor beast's nightmare and slammed the door shut again as quickly as he'd opened it" (359). Another call of the confined wild issues from the lion cage in Henri Cole's poem, "The Zoo Wheel of Knowledge," whose occupants "let go their convulsive roar," provoking shrieks of excitement from children and "a spasm like hunger to please the beast" in adults (63). This would seem to be the same primeval call that raises Jack London's readers to Niet- zschean ecstasies. But in modern Manhattan, animal calls signify pain and suffering for animals and tragedy for humans. Later in Cole's poem, two boys scale a wall and are mauled to death by polar bears who are, it turns out, territorial and vicious by nature. Cole's poem was inspired by real events at the Bronx Zoo: in the spring of 1987, an 1 1-year-old boy named Juan Perez was killed by polar bears under similar circumstances. This same incident inspired Malamud to write Reading Zoos, "partly in response to Juan's death" and partly to decide that, when he had his own children, he "would never take them to the zoo" (308). This book, then, the first of its kind to focus solely on zoos in litera- ture, is written by an author firmly committed to the abolition of zoos. All zoo stories in this book tell the same story: zoos are cruel institutions, born of colonialist greed and vanity, built to satisfy a perverse human need to gawk at animals and dominate them. Even the best rationales for zoos (that they are delightful to children, that they educate the public about wild animals or preserve endangered species) are misguided and false. Children readily see through the sham of zoos and notice the suffer- ing of animals. Zoos are damaging to efforts to save wild animals and nat- ural environments because they encourage the illusion that species can be saved without preservation of their natural habitats. Citing his own childhood memories, in olfactory and visual images that recur throughout the book, Malamud describes "the pervasive odors of excreta and fetid animal fur, flesh, feathers; an odd, surreal mixture of different animals Matt Senior 119</page><page sequence="2">and habitats; disconnected images of brick houses, dirty windows, nasty halls" (269). Chapter 1, "Zoo Stories," establishes the theoretical framework for the book and introduces its paradigm case, Edward Albee's The Zoo Story (1959). Although literary studies normally examine formal and historical questions from an objective point of view, Malamud abandons this stance, declaring at the outset, "I do not like zoos" (1). The book is written in a spirit of "activist advocacy" for green political objectives and seeks to "deconstruct the seemingly stable institutional existence that zoos have enjoyed" (10). Literary zoo stories are useful for this purpose because their multilayered, ironic language calls into question the literal and sci- entific discourse of zoos. A key critical text is Stephen Greenblatt's Mar- velous Possessions (1991), which describes the "assimilation of the other" through the use of "mimetic capital" (3-6). Zoo representations are similar to the stock of images accumulated by European explorers, which were not objective, scientific renderings of natives but, rather, imaginative "practices upon the other" (qtd. in Malamud 13). Chapter 2, "Exhibiting Imperialism," examines the link between zoos and conquest. During the nineteenth century, the development of the London Zoo "strikingly paralleled that of the British Empire" (61). Citing Edward Said, Malamud draws an analogy between labeling animals in zoos and the language of colonialist texts that "appropriate and package the 'native' experience" (58). An interesting analogy, but one of many throughout the book that does not ponder sufficiently the problem of comparing human and animal networks of subjection. The zoo can be compared to disciplinary or colonial institutions such as the prison, the hospital, and the school, but the appropriation and display of native sub- jectivity in a colonialist text or a zoo is not the same thing as the capture and display of wild animals. Animals have a sort of culture, but they do not, like human subjects, aspire to nationhood and a literature of their own. One must avoid a subtle anthropomorphism that converts animals into human beings in need of education, rights, and liberation. Certainly, colonialist practices pushed natives toward the category of exotic animals and, likewise, the capture and display of animals were used to connote imperial grandeur, thereby infusing animals with symbolic human mean- ing. But, in deconstructing these practices, one must insist on the com- plex, yet essential difference between humans and animals, as Derrida has recently argued: "I have sought to give, tirelessly, of my attention to dif- ference, to differences, to heterogeneities and abyssal ruptures as against the homogeneous and the continuous" (398). Chapter 3, "Cages," examines the cage as a literal and semiotic struc- ture powerfully controlling whatever animals (including human animals) are placed in its confines. The originality of Malamud's approach yields 120 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="3">an insightful reading of Rilke's well-known poem, "The Panther." The caged animal has most often been read as an allegory of the alienated, constrained poet, but Malamud focuses attention on the literal conditions of the panther. When Rilke states that the panther has "no world," an observation often glossed with references to Heidegger's notion that ani- mals have no "world" in the human sense, Malamud focuses attention on the fact that the panther has no animal world because it is deprived of its free-roaming existence. Chapter 4, "Pain," considers texts that document animal pain in zoos, including an appalling account of Thomas Edison's electrocution of an elephant on Coney Island. Chapter 5, "Spectatorship," focuses on the motives for human enjoyment of animal spectacles. No healthy, admirable, or recuperable impulses are discovered here: all zoo spectator- ship is based on voyeurism or zoophilia, such as that documented in Marie Nimier's The Giraffe, where a man masturbates while staring at "the crimson rump of an old female baboon" (227). The following chapter, "Kids and Zoos," argues that children do not really like zoos. According to a childhood recollection of the zoo by William Carlos Williams, "the smell was appalling" (270). In the same vein, Britte Jachinski's photogra- phy expresses "a kind of primitive regret" that children feel towards zoo animals (275). Texts where zoos figure as backdrops to human stories are the subject of the final chapter, "Animals and Their Contexts." Jean Stafford's "In the Zoo" (1953) portrays two sisters meeting in the Denver zoo, discussing scenes from their difficult childhood. A blind old polar bear symbolizes the harshness of their upbringing, as it "ceaselessly shakes its head in the stark heat of the July and mountain noon" (314). The chapter concludes in lauding Albrecht Diirer's woodcut of a rhinoceros for being morally and esthetically superior to "an imperial appropriation of the thing itself" (340). The implication of art and science in animal captivity is raised one final time in this example. Although he did not see the captured animal, Diirer relied on an "imprisoned" rhinoceros to create the portrait. To understand and admire animals, humans have often been obliged, throughout history, to capture them. Scientific study of animals, benefi- cial to humans and to animals, has involved capture and death. As for the pure esthetic enjoyment of living animals (including their "stench"), the question remains whether such encounters, even in the dystopic environ- ment of zoos, are valid and justifiable experiences. For large numbers of city-dwellers, zoos will probably remain the lesser of two evils. Ideally, in increasingly humane and salubrious conditions, animals will live with minimal disruption to their lives, while providing humans with a shabby and contrived vision of nature. This is certainly preferable to the large- scale invasion of the animals' natural habitat. And zoos might serve as a Matt Senior 121</page><page sequence="4">perpetual reminder of how far we are from Eden on both sides of the glass. Living under an imposed peace, animals languish in ennui in the zoo, while humans, whose moral codes prohibit violence, seem incapable of containing their own aggression by any means. However one feels about these institutions, whether they should be abolished or reformed, Reading Zoos is an invaluable source for studying the role of literature in forming perceptions of zoos, and a passionately argued plea for better treatment of animals.
