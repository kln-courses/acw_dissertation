Pp. xii, 487. 55s. $9.50. KIRK AND RAVEN here present an outstand- ing contribution to scholarship on the pre- Socratics, one which is sure to take its place as a standard work, at least for a good many years. Though it is sufficiently less easy to read, and more expensive, that it will not supplant Burnet's Early Greek Philosophy (last revised in 1920, recently re-issued in paperback form), it may be regarded as in many respects a successor, and a worthy one, to that book. The au- thors cover almost exactly the same ground as Burnet: they omit the Sophists and, except for occasional mention, the minor figures, mostly Pythagoreans and atomists, included by Diels; they give relatively small space to Leucippus and Democritus; and their attention is focused mainly on the specifically "physical" (and metaphysical) interests of the philosophers. Unlike Burnet, they give the Greek text; also unlike him, they do not attempt to give all the frag- ments of the major figures. As to interpre- tation, there are of course many differences in detail, but it may be said that in general they belong to the same tradition. They are, rightly, much more cautious in the use of the word "science," and are concerned to demonstrate a continuity as well as a con- trast between mythological and rational thought. In this they make good use of the insights of Cornford and others and of recent discoveries and scholarship in various fields, including the comparative mythology of the early Near East. Still, they maintain clearly the difference: "What gave [the Ionians] the title of philosopher was their abandonment of mythopoeic forms of thought, of person- ification and anthropomorphic theistic ex- planations, and their attempt to explain the seen world in terms of its seen constit- uents" (p. 72). After an introductory note on the sources and a long and rather inconclusive chapter on "The Forerunners of Philosophical Cos- mogony," they take up thinkers and schools individually, in seventeen chapters divided into three groups. Though the chapters can well be read separately, this is not merely a collection of discrete studies. In three in- troductory notes on "The Ionian Thinkers," "The Italian Schools," and "The Post-Par- menidean Systems," and in concluding sum- maries appended to several chapters, the authors give their interpretation of the de- velopment of pre-Socratic thought and the interrelation of the various systems and persons. Indeed, the attempt to relate each system to its predecessors is a guiding prin- ciple throughout, and the book brings not only contributions of detail but a step in the direction of that soundly-based understand- ing of the pre-Socratic period as a whole, toward which scholarship has been working. The thought of Parmenides is seen as cen- trally important in the course of philo- sophical development. Dissatisfied with the views of his predecessors, and in particular with that of Pythagoras, to which he at first adhered, he developed his own highly original system, establishing in the process certain canons with which his successors felt constrained to comply: that being can- not come from not-being, that void is non- existent, that plurality cannot come from unity, and that the existence of motion cannot be taken for granted but must be explained (p. 319). In discussing the post- Parmenidean systems the authors devote a part of each chapter to showing how each is, in its own way, "a deliberate reply to Parmenides." The atomism of Leucippus and Democritus, "in many ways the crown of Greek philosophical achievement before Plato" (p. 426), is regarded, like the plu- ralism of Empedocles and Anaxagoras, as having been developed in the effort to pro- vide for plurality and motion, while adher- ing to the Parmenidean canons. Raven writes the chapters on "The West- ern Schools," and in general follows the argument of his earlier book, Pythagoreans and Eleatics (Cambridge, 1948), that as Par- menides' criticism was mainly against the Pythagoreans, Zeno's arguments against plurality and motion were also directed primarily against their theory, in which number, composed of a "plurality of units,"</page><page sequence="2">276 BOOK REVIEWS is tantamount to atoms. He is even more cautious than in that book, not only refusing the term "number-atomism" used by Corn- ford and others but emphasizing that the Pythagorean assumption that units are spa- tially extended was "only tacit" (p. 247; cf. 290 f.). He has abandoned Burnet's view that the Being of Melissus, though it has no body (frag. 9), is yet not incorporeal. Still, his insistence on a "special anti-Pythago- rean significance" in the Eleatic arguments remains.1 The authors think of the Milesians as seeking "a purely materialist explanation of the world," and contrast them in this with the Pythagoreans who "employ stranger principles and elements ... , the reason be- ing that they took them from non-sensible things" (p. 216, quoting Aristotle). Perhaps "naturalistic" would be a better word here than "materialist," especially in view of the fact that the Pythagoreans and Eleatics "end in a corporealism hardly less total, if much more difficult to understand, than that of the Milesians" (ibid.). They would restrict the extent of the important fragment of Anaximander by omitting the first part of the sentence (ex h6*n de he. genesis esti tois on.si, kai t .n phthordn eis tauita ginesthai: in their trans- lation, "and the source of coming-to-be for existing things is that into which destruc- tion, too, happens"), largely on grounds of vocabulary (the abstracts grnesis and phthord are not well-established in pre- Socratic times), but partly as expressing "basic dogma" of Aristotle. These argu- ments do not seem quite convincing, nor does their suggestion as to the sentiment of Anaximander which Theophrastus may have been paraphrasing (p. 121). The chapter on Heraclitus strikes another blow at the naive view, still so often heard, that Heraclitus thought all things without exception to be in flux. The fundamental fact for Heraclitus, they maintain, is not the change that is always taking place, but the order and regularity, exemplified by the Logos, "which ensures that change does not produce disconnected, chaotic plural- ity" (p. 205). They hardly seem to have answered the objections of G. Vlastos, in his response to Kirk's earlier Heraclitus: The Cosmic Fragments,2 to the rejection of certain of the river-fragments (91, first part, and 49a), and to certain other points; but the reader will not be seriously misled by this chapter. The two interpretations agree that for Heraclitus change is con- stant and that regularity, measure, and pro- portion are characteristic of it; the differ- ence of opinion relates to the emphasis. It remains uncertain (though it seems un- likely) whether Heraclitus believed in a periodic conflagration, transforming all things into fire.3 Some of the arguments on which Kirk and Raven rely in rejecting the theory are not very strong. Neither frag. 30 (" . . . an everlasting fire, kindling in measures and going out in measures") nor frag. 90 ("All things are an equal exchange for fire and fire for all things, as goods are for gold and gold for goods") can "utterly invalidate" it, as they claim (p. 202, note). In 30, even if the measured changes are "simultaneous," there may well be a tem- porary preponderance, or even a moment of total victory, of fire, just as (turning to the "trade-image" of frag. 90) a merchant might at one time have all gold or all goods. There is an interesting addition to the many modern interpretations of Anaxago- ras' physical theory. It is characterized by simplicity and the determination both to understand him in the light of his philo- sophical background and to interpret him from his own words rather than from what he might have said if he had thought of it. The discussion of Empedocles, which "owes much to the unpublished work of the late F. M. Cornford" (p. 323), centers mainly on the problem of the apparent in- consistency of the two poems he wrote, especially as to the nature of the soul and its immortality. It is suggested, following a hint of Aristotle, that the portion of Love which each individual contains, according to the poem On Nature, provides the physical basis for the immortal and migrating soul of the Purifications. In their use of sources Kirk and Raven are critical and rather conservative. They reject the fragments of Philolaus, omit Archytas altogether, and deny the value as evidence of the Pythagorean doxography from Alexander Polyhistor in Diogenes Laer- tius 8. 24 ff., which Raven formerly ac- cepted (Pythagoreans and Eleatics, pp. 159 ff.). They do seem to give more credit to Aristotle than would some other recent writers, as for example in the chapters on Pythagoreanism; but they regard with great (exaggerated?) suspicion the authority of Theophrastus. To take an example which is in itself unimportant, they suppose that though he quotes from it and comments on its style, Theophrastus did not have an ac- tual copy of the book of Anaximander (p. 101). Again, it is hard to see what is gained by insisting so eagerly, against virtually all the meager evidence we have, that Anaxa- goras wrote only one book, and that a short one (pp. 365 f.).</page><page sequence="3">277 There are 619 numbered passages in Greek, each translated at the foot of the page on which it occurs. Indeed, no Greek is left untranslated except for an occasional word or phrase in the commentary. The translations are excellent - close, unam- biguous, clear, and readable. Each trans- lated passage is conveniently labeled with the same bold-face numeral as the original, but references are of course not repeated. Not all of these passages are "fragments," exact or otherwise; many are, rather, il- lustrative material from various sources. An unwary undergraduate who went through this material only, conveniently set apart as it is, would be reading not only the philosopher's words but doxographical ac- counts and much other illustrative material, including quotations to illuminate by con- trast the thought of the chapter's principal subject. This is not an adverse criticism but a caveat for teachers; the book is not intended primarily for the tiro. The fullness with which the actual frag- ments of various philosophers are repre- sented varies. For Parmenides we have 136 lines of the 160 preserved, for Heracli- tus 51 of the 126 fragments given as gen- uine by Diels-Kranz, and for Democritus only 9 of the nearly 300 supposedly authen- tic fragments. The authors do not hesitate to rearrange the material, quoting to suit the development of their exposition: Par- menides' fragment 7-8, for example, a con- tinuous passage of 66 lines, is all given, but in eight different sections. But few would quibble over a broken fragment. In quoting "verbal" fragments the auth- ors add the numbers given them in the B- sections of Diels-Kranz, but for the many doxographical passages from the A-sections references to Diels-Kranz are omitted ex- cept in cases where the Fragmente der Vorsokratiker has more context than Kirk and Raven quote. This is sometimes incon- venient: when one wishes to refer to the Diels-Kranz notes on an A-passage, it is too often necessary to consult their Stellen- register. Textual criticism is not a feature of the book; a general reference is made in the preface to the textual notes in Diels-Kranz. Where it seems important for the interpre- tation, the authors have usually recorded variants and restorations; the only reser- vation to be made here is as to the wisdom of occasionally printing two fragments con- tinuously without indication of the point of break (as at Empedocles 11-12, p. 323). It may be rather disappointing to some that the authors decided to restrict them- selves to the physical and cosmological in- A NEW PROGRAM IN LATIN Summer Refresher Courses In California June 23 to July 24 * REVIEW OF LATIN FUNDAMENTALS Latin S-121 4 units * TEACHERS' COURSE IN CAESAR Latin S-153 2 units Both courses carry upper division credit and are designed for teachers already teaching in other fields who anticipate teaching Latin but feel the need of refresher work. For complete brochure write Dean of the Summer Session COLLEGE of the PACIFIC Stockton 4, California terests of the chief philosophers, that a new attempt at synthesis should not cast its net wider, to show philosophy in its rela- tion to other concerns, as one of the facets of the intellectual life of the period. Solon is mentioned only incidentally, Hesiod only as a cosmogonist. The Sophists are omitted. The introductory sections usually headed "Date and Life" are much taken up with chronological data; while a few give some of the evidence for the practical and politi- cal activities of the philosophers, there is almost no attempt to correlate this with their more strictly philosophical pursuits. All scholars will find the book rewarding, however, with new and valuable interpre- tations in nearly every chapter. At the same time, it is an excellent book for one begin- ning serious study of the subject. The se- lection of texts is carefully and wisely made, and the reader is not led to an erroneous impression that the subject is here ex- hausted. The main ideas of the principal figures are well brought out, and in addition the authors introduce the most important controverted issues. To each of these they give an excellent general orientation, with enough material to enable the careful reader, if not always to decide on the evi- dence, at least to see what sort of issue is</page><page sequence="4">278 BOOK REVIEWS at stake and what kinds of evidence are available. This feature of the book will be especially useful in bringing these problems to the attention of some of the many non- specialists who make use of pre-Socratic material, and perhaps reducing the incidence of errors, quackeries and out-dated interpre- tations. The book is beautifully printed and bound, and remarkably free of misprints and other technical errors. EDWIN L. MINAR, JR.
