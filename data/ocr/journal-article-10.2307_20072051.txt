Since its installation as a state ideology, Pancasila has been the most commonly used rhetoric in political discourse and the governing principle of social life. In spite of its significance, Pancasila has remained an incomplete doctrine, primarily because of the abstract nature of each principle. It does not specify, for example, what deity is the "One God", what is "just and civilized Humanity", on what system the "wisdom of representative deliberation" should be based and how "social justice" should be achieved for all Indonesians. In this respect, Pancasila has been an ideology that should be supplemented by concrete ideas, depending on the socio-economic and political conditions of the time.2 In this paper, the process of making specific the first principle in Pancasila will be examined. The discussion focuses on various interpretations of religious freedom and the efforts of Muslims to impose an Islamic view of religious freedom on the national legal system. It is argued that Islamic ideas of religious freedom, the core of which is that religious freedom cannot be attained without due attention and regulations, has been partially adopted by the New Order government and that this has resulted in a gradual shift in the perception of religious duties from something that is the responsibility of an individual or a given religious community to something that should be handled by the family, the schools, the community and the government. In the last section of this paper, a case from Yogyakarta will be presented to show how developments at the national level have shaped the ways Muslims and Christians interact in a rural village. ll am grateful to James J.

Belief in God (Ketuhanan) was fifth in the original scheme.4 According to Sukarno, this principle meant that the state was based on religious belief (bertuhan) and that all citizens should (hendaknya) believe in their own god. This pillar did not accord a special position to any specific religion, but rather gave equal status to every religion. After clarifying the meaning of "Belief in God", Sukarno explained what the relationship should be between followers of different religions based on this fifth principle: The Indonesian nation is expected to be a nation where each citizen can worship his or her own God in freedom (cara yang leluasa). All citizen are desired to believe in God in a cultured manner (secara kebudayaan), that is without religious egoism.... the fifth principle of our nation is Belief in God in a cultured manner, Belief in God based on high morality and Belief in God where followers of different religions respect each other.5 The idea that Sukarno put forward in this speech was not easily accepted by members of the Islamic group in the committee, who wanted a nation based on Islam. Their position was, as Wachid Hasyim proposed, to include a clause in the Constitution affirming that "the religion of Indonesia is Islam".6 They might agree to Sukarno's idea of including Belief in God as a principle of Pancasila and establishing freedom to believe in religions other than Islam, but they could not assent to the equal treatment of all religions. The majority of Indonesians were Muslims, and therefore the state should be based on Islam. The tensions between the Islamic and nationalist groups were finally resolved when nine leaders in the committee reached a compromise called the Jakarta Charter (Piagam Jakarta),7 which was expected, at the time of this compromise, to be the Preamble to the Constitution.8 It reads in part: ... independence of Indonesia is expressed in the Constitution of the Indonesian nation ... which is based upon: Belief in God (KeTuhanan), with the obligation for adherents of Islam to practise Islamic law, in accordance with the principles of Humanity that is just and civilized, Unity of Indonesia, Democracy guided by the wisdom of representative deliberation, and Social Justice for all Indonesian people. A comparison of the Jakarta Charter with the Pancasila proposed by Sukarno shows three differences which demonstrate that it was the product of compromise. First, the 3A.M.W.

Second, the equal treatment of the five principles in Sukarno's speech was not retained, and Belief in God was given a higher place than the other four by making the latter modify the former. Third and most importantly, a phrase was added concerning the "obligation of Muslims to practise Islamic law".9 Despite their literal clarity, it was not obvious what "the seven words" might mean in managing the state where not all Muslim citizens carried out Islamic law to the same degree. Did it mean that the government had authority to intervene in Islamic matters in order to force Muslim citizens to fulfill their religious obligations, or was it just a moral guide? This ambiguity seems to have been precisely what was intended by the Islamic group, which did not have the dominant political hegemony over other factions to achieve an Islamic state. As the meaning of "the seven words" would be defined according to the strength of Islamic power in national politics, the Islamic group could expect much in the future when it would be able to dominate other religious and political groups. In this sense, "the seven words" constituted a compromise which satisfied the Islamic group. In later political developments, however, the advantages anticipated by the Islamic group could not be secured. The Preparatory Meeting of the Committee for Independence of Indonesia (Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia), convened just after the proclamation of independence on 17 August 1945, replaced Belief in God and "the seven words" with the expression "Belief in One God" (KeTuhanan Yang Maha Esa)', the other four principles were retained intact. Apart from being unable to prevent this development, the Islamic group also failed to include a stipulation in the Constitution that the presidency of Indonesia must be reserved for Muslims.10 Muhammad Hatta, the chairman of the meeting, justified these modifications by emphasizing the superiority of national integration over the conflicting interests of different groups: "[with these revisions] all the contents of the Constitution can be accepted by certain parts of Indonesia where Islam is not the major religion" and "these are the most important changes to unite all citizens".11 With these modifications, the final form of two articles in the Constitution was as follows: The president should be a native Indonesian (Article 6, Sect. 1). The State is based on belief in One God (Article 29, Sect. 1). The State guarantees the freedom of each citizen to have their own religion and to carry out their religious duties according to their own religion and belief (Article 29, Sect. 2). It is not certain why the Islamic group accepted these amendments. Non-Islamic groups disapproved of the Jakarta Charter,12 and the urgency of the situation after 9In Indonesian, this phrase is composed of seven words: dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya. Following Boland, I will call it "the seven words" throughout this paper. See B.J. Boland, The Struggle of Islam, p. 27. 10A.M.W. Pranarka, Sejarah Pemikiran Tentang Pancasila, pp. 57-59. uIbid., pp. 58, 59. 12It is said that Christian committee members demanded the omission of "the seven words" from the Constitution, even if no records remain to prove this. A Hindu delegate made an attempt to delete Islamic wording in the Constitution, suggesting a substitution of the term Allah (a word derived from Arabic designating God) for Tuhan Yang Maha Kuasa (Indonesian words signifying "God, the Almighty"). His proposal was accepted by the Committee but was not inserted into the final form of the Constitution. A.M.W. Pranarka, Sejarah Pemikiran Tentang Pancasila, pp. 59-60.</page><page sequence="4">360 Hyung-Jun Kim independence may have played a part. The Islamic group may also have thought that their retreat was only temporary. Whatever the reasons, the omission of "the seven words" symbolized the defeat of the Islamic group in national politics. Article 29 in the Constitution contained several germs of controversy, waiting to be developed in the future. First, it did not define clearly the relation between state and religion. The omission of "the seven words" made it possible to assume that compulsory measures to force Indonesian Muslims to practise Islamic law were not permitted by the Constitution as long as citizens expressed their Belief in One God. However, it did not clarify how far the government could interfere in the religious life of citizens, which could be interpreted to mean either that all citizens had total freedom to decide their own religious affairs, or else that the government, as an organization based on Belief in One God, could play the role of regulator in religious matters. Second, this stipulation did not specify what kind of deity belonged to the category of "One God". It did not provide any criteria for deciding whether a certain religion is based on Belief in One God or which authority would make such decision. Third, it did not state anything about freedom to spread one's own religious conviction to others. With these ambiguities, Article 29 in the 1945 Constitution became something requiring clarification rather than something that provided clarification of religious issues. Therefore, it opened the door to political compromise or confrontation between different groups with their own ideas of religious freedom. Religious Freedom under the Old Order The Old Order government did not stipulate any specific religious policies connected tc the concept of religious freedom in the Constitution.13 This can be explained by the political situation of the Old Order in which the balance of power was held among the nationalists, communists and Muslims, all of whom had different ideological positions on religious matters. The nationalists were more inclusive in their interpretation of religious freedom and the communists tended to be indifferent, whereas the Islamic groups attempted to define religious freedom in accordance with Islamic ideas. In this situation, a better tactic for the government was to make no new stipulation which might disturb the status quo. As a result, the official religious policy of the government was just a repetition of the Constitution: religious freedom was guaranteed and people should be tolerant of followers of different religions and respect other religions.14 In contrast with the 13A notable exception was a presidential decree issued in 1965 which lists religions followed by Indonesians, namely, Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. This decree, however, does not give these religions an exclusive and privileged status, as a part of it states: "[specifying religions confessed by Indonesians] does not mean that other religions such as Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Shintoism and Taoism are prohibited in Indonesia. These religions are given full guarantee [to be practised in Indonesia] as is stipulated in Article 20, Section 2 [in the Constitution] in so far as they do not violate the stipulations in this presidential decree or other acts and regulations." The inclusiveness of this decree contrasts with later development under the New Order, whereby these religions, with the exception of Confucianism (from 1966 on, Confucianism lost the same status as the other five religions), are tacitly considered as the religions in which Indonesians are permitted to acknowledge their faith. This development reflects the changing religious atmosphere in the New Order. For the presidential decree issued in 1965, see Budiyono, Membina Kerukunan Hidup Antar Umat Beriman, vol. I (Yogyakarta: Yayasan Kanisius, 1983), p. 106. 14Soepardo et al, Manusia dan Masjarakat Baru Indonesia, p. 49.</page><page sequence="5">The Changing Interpretation of Religious Freedom in Indonesia 361 government's attitude, Sukarno was active in propagating the concept of Belief in One God. As he clearly stated in one public lecture,15 the reason he adopted Belief in God as one principle in Pancasila was that all Indonesians, regardless of their time and place of living, believed in an entity or entities which could be called "God". "Indonesians have always lived their life, worshipping something into which they have put all their wishes and belief'.16 Therefore, not to take this reality into consideration for nation building would exclude an element at the heart of the beliefs of all Indonesians. In order to grasp what this entity or entities had been, Sukarno resorted to the Marxist evolutionary paradigm, in which the diversity in Belief in God throughout history was equated with the development of the productive force. "The ways human beings seek after foods and drinks and manage, maintain and protect life is really important since these influence modes of thinking".17 In the first stage of human history, when people lived by hunting and gathering, they believed in spirits associated with natural objects such as rivers, the moon, thunder, trees, clouds and the sun, which were the most essential elements to provide them with means of subsistence. At that time, "these [natural objects] were their god".18 This stage was followed by that of domesticating animals and correspondingly, the objects of worship were replaced with animals. The third stage was that of agriculture. The entity of god in this stage was shifted from animals to anthropomorphic deities such as Dewi Sri among the Javanese or Saripohaci among the Sundanese. The fourth stage saw an increasing division of labour among the previously unitary populace and the appearance of petty commodity production and trade, accompanied by the development of reason (akal). Reason made it possible for human beings to infer the concept of a god which was intangible and invisible. The fifth stage of human evolution was based on industry. Now, human beings regarded themselves as "god" since they could do things once considered the works of "god". According to Sukarno's evaluation, the majority of Indonesians in the 1950s were in the third stage while some were in the fourth and just a few in the fifth. His argument naturally raises a question: if all Indonesians proceed to the fifth phase, would they give up the concept of Belief in God? He answered this question by relying on his personal conviction: God exists without changing His true essence (zat) whereas His manifestation in this world is changeable, depending on the conceptual development of human beings. Seen from this framework, the Being behind the five different modes of belief in human history is the same entity. "Is God changeable? No! God does not change. The essence of God does not change. What is changeable is the perception of human beings".19 As an analogy to support his argument, he cited the story of five blind men who tried to comprehend what an elephant was. When A stepped forward and held its trunk, he was asked by an owner of the elephant: what is its shape? He replied that it was like a snake. B went forward and touched its leg. "Why does it feel like this, soft? But, it is like a coconut tree." C, who was taller than the others, gripped its ear. "Ya, the elephant is like the leaves of a caladium 15Sukarno, "Pantja Sila Dasar Falsafah Negara", in Tjamkan Pantja Sila!: Pantja Sila Dasar Falsafah Negara (Jakarta: Departemen Penerangan, 1964), pp. 35-93. 16Ibid., p. 81. 17Ibid., p. 83. ]8Ibid., p. 86. 19Ibid., p. 92.</page><page sequence="6">362 Hyung-Jun Kim tree!" The fourth, who was shorter, reached out and seized its tail. "Like a whip!" The fifth, who was the shortest, went forward, but could not touch its body. "I cannot touch anything. Where is the elephant?" [the owner said] "This is the elephant, above you, that is the elephant." "[if that is the case] the elephant is like air".20 Two themes permeate his argument: religious relativism and the urgency for unity among Indonesians. If there was no urgency for unity, it was not necessary to think about Belief in God, since this tenet is an axiom in human history. This is an axiom in that, at the highest level of reasoning, God exists regardless of human belief and His true entity won't be fully understood. Only the socio-economic formation of a certain period will determine a specific manifestation of God as "ultimate" and "absolute". In this relativistic paradigm, animism, polytheism, monotheism, communism or atheism can be categorized as theism, as was indicated by his argument in one Party meeting: "I am a Marxist myself, besides being a believer in God".21 In spite of its universal character, Belief in God was worthwhile emphasizing in Indonesia where no common ground existed among diverse groups waiting to be united under the rubric of one nation. On what foundation, do we want to establish independent Indonesia? Is it national Socialism? Marxism, San Min Chu I or what others? ... Together we seek a unitary philosophical ground, looking for a single foundation which we all agree with.22 It is not certain to what degree Sukarno was committed to the idea proposed in the above passages. Whatever his true intention might be, religious relativism and national unity pervaded the political arena of the Old Order, providing an environment where religious freedom defined in its widest sense could be applied. If every religion was considered to be the same and their difference was just a matter of manifestation, there would be no reason for the government to intervene in religious matters. To the Muslim politicians, Belief in One God in Pancasila was not a concept that would satisfy their aspirations. In one sense, this principle was acceptable since it did not negate the Islamic idea of tauhid, the Oneness of Allah. However, it was far too inclusive to prevent other religious or non-religious groups from being included under the protection of Pancasila. When the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) admitted its allegiance to Pancasila,23 the so-called kebatinan groups acknowledged their belief in One God, demanding the same status as Islam, and Christians carried out their missionary activities on a mass scale, Pancasila itself could not be an effective weapon for the Islamic groups to attack them. 20Ibid., p. 92. 21 Justus van der Kroef, The Communist Party of Indonesia: Its History, Program and Tactics (Vancouver: University of British Columbia, 1965), p. 7. 22Sukarno, "Lahirnya Pantja Sila", p. 18. 23In the 1950s, the PKI repeatedly expressed its allegiance to all principles in Pancasila including that of Belief in One God. The Seventh Special National Congress of the PKI in 1962 revised its Constitution so that Pancasila might be included as a part of its ideology. In spite of this official admission, most Muslims did not abandon their conviction that the PKI was an organization of infidels. They accused the PKI of opportunism and hypocrisy since the very theories of Marxism and Leninism made it impossible for Communists to accept the first principle of Pancasila. See Pipitseputra, Beberapa Aspek Dari Sejarah Indonesia: Aliran Nasionalis, Islam, Katolik sampai Akhir Zaman Perbedaan Paham (Flores: Nusa Indah, 1973) p. 362; and Justus van der Kroef, The Communist Party of Indonesia, pp. 99, 162.</page><page sequence="7">The Changing Interpretation of Religious Freedom in Indonesia 363 The different nature of each group incorporated into the terms kebatinan or kepercayaan make it almost impossible to define what a kebatinan group is. Even so, kebatinan might roughly be defined as a belief system which mixes indigenous religious elements with influences from Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, and emphasizes the human spirituality.24 After diverse kebatinan groups were organized as a unified group called Badan Kongres Kebatinan Indonesia in 1955, they contended that there was no fundamental difference between religion and kebatinan since both were based on Belief in One God25 and that they should be given the same status as other religions which were tacitly sanctioned by the Department of Religion, such as Islam, Christianity and Hindu-Buddhism.26 These bold arguments provoked the Islamic groups, which maintained that kebatinan was created by human beings, and because it denied the tauhid (Islamic monotheism) should be banned in Indonesia. As a first step, the Islamic groups urged the government to establish a legal definition of religion, and the Department of Religion made a number of attempts to do so. In 1952, the Minister proposed the presence of a Holy Book, prophets, unified teachings and international recognition as fundamental criteria to define a religion in Indonesia.27 In 1959, the Minister put forward the view that a religion should possess revelation from God (wahyu Allah), prophets, a Holy Book and principles of life to be followed by its adherents.28 These attempts faced strong objections, especially from kebatinan groups, who argued that the criteria proposed by the Muslim Ministers were relativistic, namely, whether a certain religion possesses One God, Holy Books and prophets can be determined only by adherents to that religion. Accordingly, religious freedom should include the right for Indonesians to believe whatever religion they wished.29 Compared with the kebatinan groups, Christians were in a safer position. Christianity was accepted by the Islamic groups as a religion having Belief in One God.30 However, this acknowledgment did not mean that no conflict existed between Muslims and Christians. The germ of controversies between them was their different understandings of freedom to spread religion. Christians interpreted religious freedom in its broadest sense: it implied freedom to choose religion, to change one's religion and, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one's religion in teaching, practice, worship and observance.31 Therefore, religious freedom included freedom to carry out 24The Kebatinan Congress defines kebatinan as the basic source of the principle of Belief in One God, the aim of which is to achieve a noble character and perfection of life.

This broad interpretation was not acceptable to Muslims. For them, Pancasila could not imply total freedom to spread religion since no freedom of choice was given to those who had already entered Islam and non-Islamic groups were not allowed to incite Muslims to become apostates or to leave Islam.32 The controversy surrounding the freedom to spread one's religion intensified as Christians pursued their campaign to proselytize Muslims, and their missionary operations succeeded in attracting converts. In Java, the Roman Catholic Church almost doubled in size from 125,486 in 1953 to 241,387 in 1965, and membership of several Protestant Churches in Java increased by more than 20 per cent per annum.33 Christians attributed the rapid growth of the Church both to the syncretic tendency of the Javanese and to the extreme political and economic instability of that time.34 For Muslims, however, it was the result of "dirty play" by Christians. This perception was reflected in a stenciled Muhammadiyah pamphlet outlining the missionary tactics which were said to have been agreed on in a joint conference of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches: to build churches in places where a majority of the inhabitants were Muslims; to promise Muslim employees a promotion on condition that they would comply with requests from Christians; to give material benefits to Muslims; to translate the Bible into Arabic; to establish Christian schools; and, especially for the Christian girls, to lure and marry Muslim males and convert them to Christianity.35 In Muslim eyes, Christian missionary activities were obvious violations of Pancasila. The Pancasila to which Christians resorted was not Pancasila but Pancasalah (five mistakes) or Pencaksilat (a kind of martial art).36 Under the Old Order, Islamic groups failed to achieve tangible results in their confrontation with kebatinan and Christian groups. They could not outlaw kebatinan groups and could not forbid Christian missionary activities directed at Muslims. To some extent the cause of this failure lay in the weak bargaining position of Islamic groups vis-?-vis the government as a consequence of several Muslim revolts, a weak electoral performance by Islamic groups, and the fact that the emphasis on the unity between different interest groups which dominated the political arena of the Old Order made it easy to identify a Muslim critique of other religious groups with separatist activity.37 In these circumstances, the Islamic groups could not take a firm stand against the expansion of kebatinan and Christianity, or the government's inertia in regulating religious life. 32Kasman Singodimejo, Renungan dari Tahanan (Jakarta: Tintoamas, 1969), pp. 73-74. 33Lembaga Penelitian dan Pembangunan Sosial, Ichtisar Statistik Tentang Geredja Katolik di Indonesia: 1949-1967 (1968), table 33 and Avery Willis, Indonesian Revival: Why Two Million Came to Christ (California: William Carey Library, 1977), p. 192. 34Frank Cooley, Indonesia: Church &amp; Society (New York: Friendship Press, 1968), p. 92. 35Umar Hasyim, Toleransi dan Kemerdekaan Beragama Dalam Islam Sebagai Dasar Menuju Dialog dan Kerukunan Antar Agama: Sejarah Toleransi dan Intoleransi Agama dan Kepercayaan sejak Jaman Yunani (Surabaya: PT.

They [Christians] Christianized Muslims by distributing hundreds of rupiahs and with systematic ways to hurt the hearts of Muslims. However, if we opened our mouths, we were accused of being mti-Pancasila or fanatics."

The silence of the Islamic groups, however, did not mean that they abandoned their opposition to other religious groups. Rather, their dissatisfaction was fostered internally, waiting for the right time to act. Religious Freedom under the New Order Government The most significant moment in the modern history of Indonesia came on 30 September 1965. It was on this day that the Communist Party (PKI) allegedly launched a coup against the Sukarno government, and the failure of this coup in the capital resulted in a massive attack by Muslims against PKI sympathizers in the countryside. Hundred of thousands of deaths were reported, and communism was almost eradicated by the mass killings, which only subsided in the next year. When the New Order government was installed after suppression of the alleged coup, Islamic groups naturally anticipated that their energetic involvement in eradicating communists would enhance their bargaining power with the government, and they intenisfied their demands to achieve the goals they had identified under the Old Order. One of the issues that they raised was the activities of Christian missions,38 an issue that received particular attention because many of the PKI suspects and sympathizers took refuge in Christianity. It is estimated that more than two million people converted to Christianity during this period.39 In contrast to the situation under the Old Order, the anger of Muslims against Christians now found expression in open confrontation. In Aceh, the construction of a church was obstructed, and in Makassar, a Christian Church was damaged by Muslims who were furious at the provocative speech of a Christian school teacher.40 Although small in scale, these open conflicts were serious enough to draw the attention of political leaders who were not accustomed to this sort of physical confrontation between Christians and Muslims. Shortly after these incidents, parliamentary discussions were convened, which were followed by a nation-wide religious conference (Musyawarah antar Agama). In this conference, President Soeharto stated a clearer government position on religious freedom and inter-religious relations. Soeharto began his speech by commenting on the incidents in Aceh and Makassar. He ascribed these happenings to misunderstandings between Christians and Muslims and to an attempt by Communist remnants to break down the unity of Indonesia. Like Sukarno, Soeharto incorporated Pancasila into his rhetoric, emphasizing its role as a concept teaching tolerance and an attitude of respect to followers of different religions. He then gave a more concrete interpretation than ever to the meaning of Article 29, Sect. 2 in the 380ther major demands of Muslims were to legalize the Jakarta Charter and to rehabilitate the banned Islamic Party, Masjumi, neither of which was accepted by the Soeharto government. See Allan Samson, "Islam in Indonesian Politics", Asian Survey 8,12 (1968): 1005-1013. 39Frank Cooley estimates that the Protestant Church alone saw an increase of two million converts while the Catholic Church reported annual increases of 100,000 followers in 1965-67.

According to him, this article prescribed that people could not force their religious convictions upon others and that proselytizing activities (penyebaran agama) of a certain religion should not be carried out either to increase its followers or by employing methods which could give an impression that these activities were directed at followers of different religions. The last part of his speech was devoted to explaining the position of government concerning international associations of religious organizations. As religion was universal, the government had no intention of hindering the relations between religious organizations in different countries but only on the condition that these relations ran within prescribed rules and regulations.41 Although it did not respond to all Muslim concerns, Soeharto's speech showed that the government accepted the core preoccupation of the Islamic groups: that Christians should limit their missionary activities to those who did not have a religion or were polytheists. Encouraged by the presidential speech, one speaker at Musyawarah antar Agama, H.M. Rasyidi, strongly criticized Christian missionary activities. He compared Indonesian Christians to Kristen beras (rice Christians, namely, those accepting Christianity not out of belief but for material benefits) and equated "human rights" (hak azasi manusia) as used by Christians with a right to change one's religion from Islam to Christianity. Then, he asked delegates from the Christian Churches to sign a charter which stated that the aim of missionary activities was to persuade atheists to have Belief in One God, and that missionaries should not make those who already had a religion the target of proselytization.42 There seemed no particular reason for Christian delegates to comply with the demands of their Muslim counterparts.43 They rejected the proposal on the grounds that one of the central tenets of Christianity was witnessing to all people irrespective of their present religious status and that the charter was contradictory to religious freedom as stipulated in Pancasila.44 The Christians' refusal ended the first open clash between Muslims and Christians in the New Order. This refusal and the fact that no measures could be taken to force Christian delegates to accept the charter enraged Islamic leaders, but they could do nothing. It took almost a decade for their anger to abate. Before looking at developments in the 1970s, a short digression will pinpoint the key issues in the confrontation over Christian missionary activities. In a question addressed to Parliament, Lukman Harun summarized Muslim concerns about Christian missionary 41 Soeharto, "Pidato Sambutan Pejabat Presiden Republik Indonesia, Soeharto, Pada Pembukaan Musyawarah Antar Agama Pada Tanggal 30 Nopember 1967 di Jakarta", in Toleransi dan Kemerdekaan Beragama, ed.

One of their strengths came from their active role in denouncing the attempted communist coup. As soon as news of the coup spread, the Indonesian Council of Protestant Churches issued a statement, registering their reaction to atrocities inflicted by Communists, thanking God for the failure of the coup and expressing their support for the leadership of the country. The Roman Catholic Party also supported the disassociation of the PKI and the installation of General Soeharto as a president. The Catholic Student organization played an important part in the youth movement called "Generation of 1966", which expedited the shift of power from Sukarno to Soeharto. B.J.

These issues were all interrelated. The funds and personnel from foreign countries were thought to be used to build churches, schools and hospitals at the centre of Muslim communities, to support missionaries, to publish Christian pamphlets and books, and to give out materials to Muslims. To rectify the misuse of the concepts of tolerance and religious freedom, which were interpreted by Christians as enabling them to build a church at the centre of the Muslim community, Lukman Harun argued that those who already confessed their religion should not be the target of missionary activities; religious assistance from foreign countries should pass through the Department of Religion; foreign missionaries should be prohibited from entering Indonesia; and the government should regulate the construction of churches and the propagation of religion. The 1970s saw the proposals of Lukman Harun accepted by the government one by one. This process culminated in two decrees issued in 1978 by the Ministry of Religion, one of which (No. 70) reads: The spread of religion cannot be approved of when: 1) [it is] directed to a person or persons who already have another religion; 2) [it is] done by resorting to enticement/distribution of money, clothes, food/drink, medicines and so on to attract persons who already have another religion; 3) [it is] done by disseminating pamphlets, bulletins, magazines, books and other materials in areas/houses where the residents have another religion; 4) [it is] done by making door-to-door visits on whatever pretext to those who already have another religion. Decree No. 77 states: Sect. 2 Assistance from foreign countries ... can be accepted only after acquiring agreement/recommendation from the Department of Religion and when it is channeled through the Department of Religion. Sect. 3 (a) ... restrictions apply to the use of foreign personnel for developing and spreading religion. The similarity between the two decrees and the arguments of Rasyidi and Lukman Harun shows that these decrees symbolized a victory for Muslims in their long struggle to impose Islamic ideas of religious freedom on the national legal system. Decree No. 70 made it possible to argue, at least in legal terms, that a Christian son violates the law when he talks about Christianity to his Muslim parents.46 Decree No. 77 gave the 45Lukman Harun et al, "Interpelasi Anggota DPRGR Drs. Lukman Harun dkk", in Toleransi dan Kemerdekaan Beragama, pp. 299-308. 46This interpretation was given by a head officer of the Department of Religion at the kecamatan (sub-district) level, showing one way Decree No. 70 can be interpreted. This does not mean, however, that the decree prohibits Indonesians from talking about their religion to followers of different religions in any circumstances whatsoever. Dialogues about religions are said to be permitted and encouraged, but on the condition that the aim is to deepen knowledge about other religions and not to spread religion to others. In a situation where criteria to determine whether the purpose of religious dialogue is to understand or to spread a certain religion are not available, application of the Decree is dependent on the subjective evaluation of an individual or a group. In this sense, Decree No. 70 would become another source of controversy in the future between Muslims and Christians.</page><page sequence="12">368 Hyung-Jun Kim Department of Religion, which was under Muslim influence, the right to manage foreign Christian funds and to issue permits to foreign missionaries, an arrangement which eventually gave it control over these matters.47 During the years which followed, these two decrees were disseminated to the public through the Departments of Religion and Internal Affairs. In some instances, the government initiated inter-religious meetings (Musyawarah antar agama) where representatives of five official religions were invited. In Yogyakarta, the inter-religious meetings were held in 1983 and 1984. The primary aims of these meetings were to inform delegates from the five religions mentioned of the two decrees and to provide them with an opportunity to reach an agreement on ethical codes for followers of different religions. In the 1983 Yogyakarta meeting, the delegates agreed upon five ethical codes related to (1) construction of places of worship, (2) propagation of religion, (3) marriage between followers of different religions, (4) burial and (5) commemoration of religious days.48 Some of these are as follows: (1) When building a new place of worship, the number of people who will use that place and its distance from the existing place of worship of another religion should be considered; an ordinary house should not be used as a place of worship.49 (2) Proselytism should not be directed at a person or a group of persons who already have another religion. (3) The ideal marriage is one between a man and a woman who have the same religion. Thus, marriage between man and woman who have different religion should be avoided (dihindari) and prevented (dicegah) as much as possible. When a mixed marriage takes place, guidance has to be sought in order for the newly married to carry out their respective religious teachings. 47The Protestant and Catholic Churches expressed their objection to the two decrees. They argued that restrictions on the freedom to spread religion contradicted religious freedom guaranteed by the 1945 Constitution and that these decrees violated the essence (hakikah) of every religion, namely, that religious messages should be spread not only to a limited circle of human beings but to all mankind. This reaction from Christians brought no result, and open criticisms of the two decrees soon abated when the government expressed its strong intention to maintain them by issuing another decree in 1979. The new decree, reiterating Decree No. 70 in 1978, was signed not only by the Minister of Religion but by the Minster of Internal Affairs. See, Sekretariat Umum Dewan Gereja-Gereja di Indonesia &amp; Sekretariat Majelis Agung Waligereja Indonesia, Tinjauan mengenai Keputusan Menteri Agama No. 70 dan No. 77 Tahun 1978 dalam Rangka Penyelenggaraan Kebebasan Beragama dan Pemeliharaan Kerukunan Nasional (Jakarta, 1978), mimeo. 48Departemen Agama Yogyakarta, Munakahat Membina Keluarga Sakinah dan Keputusan Forum Dialog Pemuka-Pemuka Agama Prop. Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta: Kantor Departemen Agama, 1990), pp. 19-48. 49 Apart from the regulations related to the propagation of religion, Muslims were also successful in enacting decrees to regulate the construction of a church. A decree issued in 1969 made permission from the government and from the residents of a certain area a prerequisite to the construction of religious buildings, while the decree in 1975 prohibited an ordinary house from being used as a group prayer house on a regular basis. These decrees could effectively control the expansion of missionary activities since Christians were forced to obtain the agreement of the local Muslim population in order to build a church. The 1975 regulation made it almost impossible, at least in legal terms, for Christians to initiate missionary activities in a new area where no work had been carried out previously, since private houses could not be used for religious purposes and no church could be constructed. See Proyek Perencanaan Peraturan Perundangan Keagamaan, Peraturan Perundangan Yang Menyangkut Tata Kehidupan Beragama dan Pendirian Rumah Ibadah (Jakarta: Departemen Agama, 1980/81).</page><page sequence="13">The Changing Interpretation of Religious Freedom in Indonesia 369 (4) A burial place prepared by the government is open to everyone living in a certain area irrespective of religion. (5) In principle, the commemoration of the Holy Days of a certain religion should be celebrated and attended by those who confess that religion. However, those who belong to a different religion can also participate in this occasion on the condition that this visit is made to maintain family ties, good neighbourhood relations and community spirit (kegotong-royongan). The behavioural norms between followers of different religions are not confined to these five codes but are expected to embrace all other domains of social life. Therefore, people are expected to be aware that their behaviour and speech could offend followers of different religions in everyday interaction. The spread of this emphasis on adequate behavioral codes to every layer of the population has resulted in a gradual change in how relations between followers of different religions are perceived. These have begun to be viewed as something that should be taken care of (dipelihara), cultivated (dibina) and regulated (diregulasi) in the family, school and community, and by the government. This is a shift from the Old Order period when laissez-faire was a dominant concept in discussing such relations. In this framework, an individual or a given religious community was considered fully responsible for maintaining harmonious relations with followers of different religions. With the shift of perspective, however, full responsibility is no longer given to an individual or a religious community since harmonious relations between people and groups having different religions, a prerequisite for religious freedom, cannot be attained without due attention and regulation. One Muslim intellectual puts the reason for this as follows: The meaning of religious freedom ... is that the parents who have a certain religion have to maintain and take care of their religion among their family members lest they should change religion. If conversion of a member happens, it will cause instability in a family. It is not totally impossible that the proselyte will leave the family. This will lead to a situation in which the basis of religious freedom and harmony supported by mutual respect will disappear in that family.50 One of the results of this emphasis on adequate behavioural codes has been the demands that people should determine the religious identity of those with whom they interact. This is because they cannot behave appropriately unless they know the other person's religious affiliation. For example, Christians may offer pork or alcohol to Muslims and Muslims may use Arabic greetings to Christians if their religious identity is not clearly recognized. The only way to avoid these mistakes which will jeopardize religious freedom is to be conscious of each other's religion. In short, the emphasis on appropriate behavioral norms has made religion a factor in everyday interactions and, with this emphasis, religious life is increasingly viewed as the responsibility of the religious community and the state rather than the individual.51 According to this logic, the more rules and regulations concerning religious life and inter religious relations are introduced, the more freedom of religion can be secured. 50Sahibi Nairn, Kerukunan Antar Umat Beragama (Jakarta: Gunung Agung, 1983), pp. 38-39. 51 See also Paul Stange, "Religious Change in Contemporary Southeast Asia", in The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia Volume Two: The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, ed.

This discussion, however, cannot be generalized to cover Muslim-Christian relations in rural Java. While Christians made up just one per cent of the population of rural Java in 1990,52 the proportion in the research site reached almost 25 per cent in 1993. In this respect, the discussion describes one possible way in which Muslim-Christian relations may develop in rural Java. Muslim-Christian Relations: A Case from Yogyakarta It is likely that until recently, religious difference was not a basis of social conflict and the religious distinction between Muslims and Christians was not felt strongly in Kolojonggo.53 This was symbolized by the reciprocal movements of food and visits between members of the two groups. It is said that Christians were included in the Muslims' exchange network of food after the fasting month and were invited to kendhuri (a collective ritual meal) held after the fasting month. The food that Christians received at that time was reciprocated at Christmas when they sent food parcels to their Muslim neighbours while some Muslim villagers attended the Christmas celebration held in the chapel. A remarkable change was visible in 1993-94. No food was exchanged and no more visits were made between Muslims and Christians after the fasting month and at Christmas. The acceleration of Islamic development since the 1980s, with Islam becoming more and more a factor providing a framework on things surrounding Muslims and guiding their behaviour, played a pivotal role in bringing about this change.54 A clearer line has been drawn dividing the Muslim community from the Christian one, and villagers have become more conscious of their religious differences. Promulgation of Decree No. 70 in 1978 and the subsequent spread of new behavioural norms between followers of different religions are also a key element in that these have provided Muslims with a framework to re-evaluate their interaction with Christians, a guideline to pinpoint Christian intervention in their socio-religious life and a rhetoric to articulate their concerns. Decree No. 70 and the five ethical codes agreed in the inter-religious meeting in Yogyakarta were well known to Islamic leaders and activists in Kolojonggo. They had memorized several sections of the decree and ethical codes and sometimes incorporated these into sermons. They said confidently that they, as citizens of Indonesia, had observed the regulations and ethical codes. This confidence was demonstrated when I made a complaint half in jest that an invitation card to Islamic activities had never been delivered to me during the twenty months that I stayed in Kolojonggo. The villagers responded that 52Biro Pusat Statistik, Penduduk Indonesia Menurut Propinsi, Kabupaten dan Kotamadya (Jakarta: Biro Pusat Statistik, 1990). 53Kolojonggo, a pseudonym for the hamlet in which this study was carried out, is located about 9 kilometres from Yogyakarta city. In 1993, the total population was 544, of whom 258 were male and 286 were female. 54For more about the accelerating Islamic development and subsequent changes in Kolojonggo, see Hyung-Jun Kim, "Reformist Muslims in a Yogyakarta Village: The Islamic Transformation of Contemporary Socio-Religious Life" (Ph.D. diss., Australian National University, Canberra, 1996), pp. 70-111, 234-64.</page><page sequence="15">The Changing Interpretation of Religious Freedom in Indonesia 371 they did not want to violate Decree No. 70 by issuing an invitation card to a non-Muslim foreigner though they did not object to my voluntary participation in Islamic activities. As this attitude shows, non-interference was considered by Muslims as a benchmark for the religious behaviour of followers of different religions, and as a way to achieve harmonious relations between them and eventually, religious freedom. In spite of the Pancasila and other government decrees, Islamic leaders and activisits found inter-religious relations disappointing. Many incidents occurred which were not consistent with the spirit of Pancasila and complicated the realization of harmonious life, and they attributed such happenings to intervention in the religious life of Muslims by Christians. Two examples, one delivered in at Friday prayers and the other in a meeting preparing for the fasting month, illustrate what Muslims considered vicious interference in their life by Christians. As the Prophet did not give us an example, playing with fireworks in the fasting month cannot be permitted. This is also contrary to the regulation of the government which forbids it. Above all, this forms the best opportunity for someone (sa 'tunggaling Hang) who is not friendly to Islam to distract the attention of our children from religious activities.... Let's work hard, so that the atmosphere of this month is freed from the sound of fireworks. Shall we always be influenced by them (golongan mereka) or shall we maintain our own strong devotion to Islam? This is dependent on our own will. A good example is food. In Islam, all problems connected to food are spelled out while in their religion (agama mereka), no rules are made to regulate food. As a result, their bad influences make us confused and some of us have been lured by this temptation and drink alcohol. Only by strong and mature will on our part based on Islamic teaching will we free ourselves from the addiction to alcohol, which originated with them. Neither speaker make it explicit who they meant in saying that "someone" or "they" maliciously intended to disturb Muslims. However, it is quite obvious that these statements pointed to Christians. No Muslims, in the view of Islamic leaders, would want to obstruct Islamic teachings or would benefit from doing so. Only Christians would be harmed if Muslims follow the right path of Islamic teaching. It is not certain whether, as the speaker argued, Christians intentionally used fireworks to distract the attention of Muslims from religious activities and lured them to drink alcohol. It might be or might not be. What is more important, however, is the firm belief among Islamic leaders that Christians did these things deliberately in order to lead Muslims astray. Alcohol was just one example used by Islamic leaders to show Christian interference in Muslim religious life. Their heightened consciousness could easily find similar cases in almost every domain of life. Thus, when Christians delivered invitation cards to Muslims for Christmas celebrations, when Christians held their weekly meeting in a place near the hamlet mosque and sang hymns loud enough to be heard in the mosque, when Christians celebrated a wedding or initiated community work in the fasting month, providing food and cigarettes to Muslim participants, and when Christians smoked and drank freely in front of Muslims during the fast, these actions were perceived as Christian interference in the religious life of Muslims. Conversion was another issue used by Islamic leaders to illustrate Christian transgression of the boundary between the two religious communities, a boundary which should not be transgressed if harmonious relations between followers of different religions and religious freedom were to be guaranteed.</page><page sequence="16">372 Hyung-Jun Kim According to Islamic leaders, Muslim conversions to Christianity were not directly related to religious motives but stemmed from factors external to the converts such as economic assistance, jobs, mixed-marriages and education in Christian schools.55 These were used by Christians as bait to seduce Muslims who faced difficult conditions and eventually to convert them to Christianity. Accordingly, the methods of Christian missions are in violation of the Pancasila and Decree No. 70, and constitute serious interference in Muslim religious life. To correct this situation and to protect the religious freedom of Muslims, they demanded regulations stronger than Decree No. 70 and called for tougher measures by the government. Their demands, however, could not be readily accepted. The violations of the decrees, if any, could not readily be proven and the government did not want to become involved in inter-religious relations in the absence of mass protests, which could not be organized easily by Muslims. In this situation, Islamic leaders and activists tried to take direct action to protect their own community from Christian interference. Below is an example of this trend: When the third section of the mosque council meeting came to discuss miscellaneous things, Mas (Mr) Toro56 asked for time. With a voice full of excitement, he began his speech. "Before I speak, I ask forgiveness of everyone, if there is something inappro priate in my speech. Here, I'd like to discuss a problem of Mbak (Miss) Tinah." Then, he summarized a rumor that she had participated several times in the meetings of the Bible study group. After this, he added: "I tell this story in order for us, especially Muslim youth in our hamlet, to reflect upon ourselves. When I first heard this story, I felt ashamed. I wondered why the activities of Muslim youth had deviated so far from the right track. ... In addition, I request Muslim parents to pay more attention to their children and Muslim youth to take more interest in their friends." Without talking further about the problem of Mbak Tinah, he ended his remarks. As Mas Toro mentioned, Mbak Tinah had attended Christian youth meetings. However, her attendance at these meetings did not mean her automatic conversion to Christianity. The Church decrees that someone who wants to be baptized should take instruction in Christianity for six months, and Mbak Tinah had gone to these meetings just a few times, which was not enough to qualify her for baptism. The reason why she participated in these meetings was not clear. It was plausible that frequent contact with her close Christian friends might have played the major role. It was unfortunate for her that her intentions were publicized before she underwent conversion. A few days after the mosque council meeting, Mas Toro and a few others visited her. As they did not talk in detail about this meeting, it is difficult to know what discussion took place. They might have done no more than make a simple suggestion or question her on the truth of the rumour. What is clear is that their unexpected visit conveyed a certain message to her. In Javanese social life, where not many villagers are brave enough to express their hidden or real intention to others and villagers are quite cautious about directly stating what they have in mind, this kind of simple but unexpected 55This idea is connected to Islamic leaders' view of conversion, namely that conversion is possible only after a person compares and analyzes two religions thoroughly and is convinced of the truthfulness of one over the other. As most Muslim converts to Christianity have not been given chances to carry out these activities, they argue, their conversion can be explained only by referring to extra-religious factors. 56All names appearing in the text are pseudonyms.</page><page sequence="17">The Changing Interpretation of Religious Freedom in Indonesia 373 visit can mean something important. This visit could imply that their previous indifference to her had changed to deep concern. This show of interest in her behavior clearly represented indirect pressure, alerting her to the fact that Muslims were monitoring her behaviour. As the Muslim youth expected, Mbak Tinah's visits to the mosque increased dramatically after their visit to her at home. A position was even given to her in the meeting to prepare for the fasting month, symbolizing her full incorporation into the umat Islam. The action taken by the Muslim youth is somewhat exceptional. Should news be heard of an adult villager's impending conversion, it is unlikely that a similar visit would be made by adult Muslims. They would not be brave enough to violate the social norms prohibiting direct involvement in others' private affairs until invited to do so by those directly concerned. However, although it is an aberration, the example implies that a domain previously considered to be private was changing into one that was part of the collectivity. Conversion was no longer viewed, at least by some Muslims, as an individual affair but as a collective one. This change was facilitated by the conviction that Christians were luring Muslims to convert. Muslims argued that if Christians transgressed the boundary between the two religious communities, they should take care of and guide other Muslims. Non-Muslims might see such activity as an instance of intervention in an individual's religious life, but for Muslims it was a matter of protecting their own religious freedom against Christian infringement. Concluding Remarks Since its installation as a state ideology in 1945, Pancasila has maintained its dominant position in regulating the social life of Indonesians. Even after five decades, Pancasila remains an ambiguous concept, and this ambiguity has opened the door to both compromise and confrontation between different groups which want to define it for their own benefit. The first principle of Pancasila, Belief in One God, has been no exception, and different religious groups have attempted to interpret it in accordance with their own religious convictions and interests. One of the hot issues in the interpretation of this principle has been how to understand the idea of religious freedom stipulated in it. According to Islamic groups, religious freedom means the freedom to practise one's religion without interference, and thus does not include the freedom to spread one's religion without restrictions. No freedom of choice is given to those who have already entered Islam, and the unrestricted spread of a religion will jeopardize religious harmony. This idea regarding Muslims, which was only an opinion under the Old Order, was given legal force by the New Order government in the late 1970s, and Christians are legally prohibited from carrying out missionary work among Muslims. Following this legislation, the focus of Muslim intellectuals shifted to regulating relations between followers of different religions. They propagated the idea that religious freedom cannot be achieved without such regulations, and they promulgated ethical norms to govern socio-religious relations. According to them, only when all domains of everyday life are covered by these rules and people actualize them in their everyday interaction can interference of one religious community in the religious life of others be avoided and religious freedom secured.</page></plain_text>
