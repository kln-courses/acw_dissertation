<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the sociological determination of methodology* Karl Mannheim For some time now, the demand for a novum organon in the human sciences has come up again and again. Even a cursory glance at the human sciences, as they have actually developed and continue to unfold, and at the methodological and logical knowledge about these fields reveals a discrepancy between science and logic, a discrepancy which fully justifies the demand for a new methodology. Researches in the histories of literature and philosophy along the lines of the history of ideas, the approach to the history of art by way of the history of styles, the analyses of world-views in all fields of the humanistic sciences, the cultural-sociological pattern of inquiry among sociologists and researchers into specialized topics, systematic research into ideology in Marxist sociology-all seem to aspire toward a similar goal and to work, despite many presuppositions differing in content, with similar, as yet barely analyzed methods. Correspond- ing to this process in the historical disciplines is a similar turn in the systematic disciplines related to the humanistic sciences and more or less fundamental to them. Psychology's turn from the method of experimenting and explaining to that of describing and interpreting, the powerful current of the phenomeno- logical tendency in philosophy: both bring to the fore the universally applicable method of description. And when one also considers that cultural philosophy is taking the place of systematic philosophy as the structural theory of the historical world-view, one realizes that the systematic disciplines are taking a direction similar to the change under way in the historical disciplines. In all these disciplines, new (or, at least, relatively new) sets of questions are emerging; they pursue a new kind of goal and employ new methods of thinking in this pursuit. Working out these methods represents an assignment yet to be fulfilled, for these disciplines as well as for the history of thought. That methodological theory has failed to comprehend these fields altogeth- er, or has grasped them only inadequately, is primarily due to the circumstance that the new disciplines of human-scientific research have grown out of a phi- losophy different from that in which the still dominant methodological theory originated. For it is most essential to pay attention to something which one gen- erally tends to pass over, viz., that methodologies also possess presuppositions of * Copyright ? 1980 by Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.

And their range and fruitfulness initially extend only as far as the things which have grown up out of the same world-view and its appropriate manner of life. Just as classical aesthetics, for example, could grasp the principles of classical art only, which was akin to it in spirit, so there are-mutatis mutandis - methods and tendencies of thought in the history of thought which variously bring out only one mode, one side of the knowledge possible, a side which stands in intimate relationship to the overall philosophical position and perspective of the time. The distinctive properties, the methodological construction of such a tendency of thought will be most access- ible, moreover, to the tendency in methodological theory which has grown up out of the same (or at least related) presuppositions as the thinking it seeks to investigate. To apply these general assertions directly to the problem with which we are concerned, it is only necessary to call to mind that modern natural science arose out of a spirit and philosophical attitude completely different from the tendency in historiography becoming relevant at the present time. While modern natural science first found the codification of the philosophy and methodology corre- sponding to it in Cartesian principles, and while the methodology and the prac- tice of this science are emanations of one and the same style of thought, the con- temporary historical dispensation, aspiring to analyses of world-views, got its scientific fecundation from the Romantic consciousness. Two philosophies, thoroughly different in their foundations, thus stand at the place of origin of these two complexes of scientific knowledge, and their distinctive methodo- logical properties as well as their sociological grounding can only be grasped by reaching back to these spiritually different origins. To see clearly in these mat- ters, one must not forget that philosophy, life, and scientific knowledge never go along side by side in isolation. Philosophy, in its various tendencies, always rises, rather, out of a current of life (and usually one that is socially condi- tioned), and serves as pioneer for it, first formulating, in premonitory anticipa- tion and programmatically, the new "will to the world" (Weltwollen), only to return, in the sequel, and penetrate life and science itself. It then pervades these, advances its own development within them, and achieves genuine concre- teness only at the end. It attains its highest stage, however, only when it is once again released, at a subsequent stage, from its embedment in realities, by means of reflection, and systematized. Applying this insight, then, to the first current mentioned above, to philosophy oriented to natural science, the Cartesian teach- ings concerning first principles can be considered as the earliest reflective clari- fication of the intellectual project (Denkwollen) which was striving, together with the natural sciences developing themselves at the same time, to form the world throughout. How this new cosmic and cognitive project, (Welt-und Erkenntniswollen), of which methodology is only a part, came to be, can best be traced in its practice, that is, in the coming into being of the exact natural sciences, which began in the intellectual work of Kepler and Galileo but ac- quired its human ideal-typical representative rather in Leonardo da Vinci.' 1. A valuable account of the development of these sciences and their appropriate methodology can be found in Cassirer (1911:314ff). 414</page><page sequence="3">The entire process going on in all this gains its character from the determi- nation to put another world-view in the place of one which has become faded and no longer credible, to establish new intellectual methods in place of those which have long been employed. It is on this occasion that there can be heard, perhaps for the first time in modern thought, the call of "back to nature!", which is later repeatedly sounded (whenever it is a question of putting through a new representation of the world). That this return to nature was always bound to prove a self-deception can be no surprise, since mankind never meets bare na- ture, unendowed with meanings, but puts a newformed representation of the totality in place of a decadent old one. "The struggle was for the right of perception, but the outcome is at once a new idea and a new systematization of the concept." (Cassirer, 1911:317). To the historian of this process, accordingly, with this development already behind him, the slogan of a return to nature discloses itself as a means for overcoming an antiquated method of thought, which is to be gotten out of the way in order to make room for a creative, new world-design. But it is also to be deceived to believe that the new forms of thought have been conjured up out of the void or that some form of thought, once overcome, could have been consigned to obliv- ion once and for all. Intellectual tendencies battle and conquer one another, but every possibility remains stored up for experience. It is always only a matter of victory for the time being, and of the unfolding of one of the tendencies: the other one, the one defeated, does come back, at a later stage of development, if also in altered form. The intellectual project of naturalistic rationalism, thus, simply picked up threads which had been left hanging in the history of thought, and the type of thought which it conquered continued to live, even if only as a cultural current, to become the foundation for oppositional tendencies of thought. Tracing the first tendency, it appears that the emerging, mathematically grounded mechanistic representation of the world, towards which the early modern intellectual tendency aspired, begins, as already noted, by taking up threads and directions already brought out in the philosophy and natural science of antiquity, in order to bring these to full development, now under more favorable conditions. The mathematical system of Euclid and Archimedes pre- served insights in which the mathematical rudiments of Democritus, Archytas, Eudoxus were refined. In particular, Plato's Timaeus, newly interpreted, was played off against Aristotle (Frank, 1923:143). Galileo, Kepler, Giordano Bruno, as well as Leibniz (Frank, 1923:147) read Plato again and again, but now he was interpreted from the point of view of the new intellectual and cos- mic project, in that the retained mathematical, natural-scientific elements going back to Archytus received emphasis. One sees most clearly what made up this new intellectual project if one asks oneself, what were they struggling against? And one finds a battle on two lines, the first an attack, bringing Plato into play, against Aristotelian scholastic philosophy of nature. That the latter front involved an internal struggle as well derives from the circumstance that modern natural science arose out of modern philosophy of nature. A process is re-enacted here which has had its parallels in antiquity, where an interest in na- ture directed by magic also turned into an interest in nature oriented to tech- nique. The magical mastery of nature metamorphosed into a technical mastery of nature. But what was it, then, that was to be combatted in the Aristotelian 415</page><page sequence="4">scholastic method of thought, and what was it in the Renaissance philosophy of nature? They struggle against the Aristotelian representation of the world because it was qualitatively directed2 and concerned to comprehend everything as founded upon itself, in terms of an inherent final cause and an indwelling determinacy of form. But the new intellectual project was after a representation of the world that undertook to explain the individual object in terms of general causes and laws, and sought to represent the world as a sum of masses and powers. Precisely in order to vanquish this qualitatively conditioned thinking, they had recourse to mathematics, so as to make it the foundation for knowledge of nature. In the Renaissance philosophy of nature, however, which had been taken up and from which it was now necessary to be extricated, they struggled primarily against the element of anthropomorphism.3 This is a process in which the anthropomorphic, pantheistic, nature-philosophical element is progressively eradicated from knowledge by stages. We know, after all, that Kepler was still led to astronomical researches by the astrological idea of cosmic harmony and its investigation, and we know that the fundamental concepts of natural science (law, number, powers) have anthropomorphic, nature-philosophical origins. The internal struggle to overcome these originally anthropomorphic conceptions dis- covers its symbolic career in the gradual overthrow of the concept of power in physics. The concept of power, which originally derives from an "inner experi- ence," is transformed from its animistic meaning into one of mathematical function (Cassirer: 1911:345, 353ff.). The inner make-up of this style of thought is suggested by the dominant themes of these two struggles: first, the fundamental tendency to eradicate everything qualitative, and second, mistrust towards any source of knowledge with anthropomorphic connections. It is not necessary to do more than note that the ultimate ground for this mistrust of bases of experience associated with the human body appears under the auspices of a decline of pantheistic feeling for the world. If we look more closely, this design of transforming, wherever possible, everything qualitative into quantity cannot, obviously, be set up as more than a utopian ideal of knowledge at the pinnacle of this tendency of thought. But it is important to have the ideal of an intellectual tendency in view, because the dominant themes are most readily apparent within it. The ideal presents the goal that is sought and that is made into an absolute. Theoretical physics per- forms the miracle of resolving the wealth and variety of the world into a concep- tual system, whose every part adheres to all the others, thereby rendering this variety ultimately translatable into a system of mathematical relationships. This quantification of the qualitative also derives from the tendency to de-anthropomorphize knowledge, involving the rationalistic prejudice, of course, that everything anthropomorphic is rooted in sensuous and inner appre- hension, while the rational contains a guarantee for the objectivity of know- ledge, which cannot be challenged on such grounds. Only where one can hope that one is learning something that is not humanly limited is truth to be found, 2. A fine characterization of the Aristotelian view of the world is contained in Jaeger (1923). 3. On anthropomorphism in the philosophy of nature see Joel (I 906:66ff). 416</page><page sequence="5">and only pure reason is, so to speak, the superhuman in man. Another motif clearly enters into this direction of intellectual aspiration opposing anthropo- morphism and resorting to the level of pure reason: an aspiration to render knowledge social, i.e., the tendency to drop out of the known all elements bound to the personal or to a specific community, and to cling only to determinations which are universally communicable. The certainties to be discovered are those demonstrable to anyone and not those evidential only for a believing community; and since it is precisely reason, and especially the arithmetical which appears to be of this sort, the intellectual objective of transposing the qualitative into the quantitative follows of its own accord. What Descartes had inaugurated in methodology has remained the ines- capable basis for the entire rationalistic development in philosophy (in Kant as in Leibniz), and this fundamental tendency continues to survive in most themes within German idealism: a certain conception of the concept and of cognition governs methodology and lets it appear as the self-justification of a certain in- tellectual project. This basis indicates to us, in so far as it gradually brings into being a unique coupling of general validity with truth, that it approaches the analysis of cognition with the completely unproven prejudice that man has knowledge only in so far as what he learns can be demonstrated to everyone. It is a matter, then, of that depersonalizing and decommunalizing of knowledge to which we alluded above, where the known is to be detached from any particular and communally-rooted subject in order to locate it on a conceptual level ac- cessible to any conceivable subject. In this mathematization occurs, in exem- plary fashion, the process of putting down the group-connected subject, the con- crete historical subject, in order to resort to what is abstractly and universally human. And here there is indeed a correlation between subject and object: the more abstract the elements of the object which are comprehended and empha- sized (hence the recourse to res extensa and universal laws of nature), the more abstract the knowledge obtained and hence the greater the number of subjects for whom it has validity. Universal knowledge is general in both senses of the word: it is valid for many objects and many subjects. By virtue of the productive one-sidedness characteristic of every theory, this school of thought overlooked the fact that it had hypostatized itself, in its methodological doctrine, as thought as such; that from the very outset it had set about, in attempting to render the world calculable, to know only so much about the world as might be so rendered. It was not noticed then that there are also other ways of experiencing and knowing, arising out of an altogether different kind of relationship between subject and object; that these continue to function although they are despised by the dominant methodology; that as soon as a new intellectual project emerged which wanted to comprehend as well the know- ledge neglected by the natural scientific style of thought, it would reach back to these ways of knowing; and that new methodological insights would be attain- able by starting out from this new intention. But just as modern natural- scientific knowledge, when it reached back to the mathematical natural- scientific elements in antiquity, refined them and let them develop, so it is to be expected that the methods of thinking repressed by the natural-scientific mode of thought will not experience their revitalization in the form of a mere repro- duction of pre-scientific modes of learning, but that it can only be a question of 417</page><page sequence="6">seeing how many legitimate and developable beginnings may be present in those repressed methods. But before we turn our attention to the continued existence of these ele- ments repressed by natural-scientific thinking we must first elucidate the socio- logical function of the style of thought we have been treating. When one has traced the strands of the ultimate motives of thought of natural-scientific rationalism back to this point, a sociological imputability to the spirit of capitalism-and particularly to the spiritual tendencies that first created this capitalism, which is to say to the spirit of the aspiring bourgeoisie- is irresistable. It has often been pointed out that the same (bourgeois) rational- ism manifests itself in the new economic systems as in early modern natural science.4 When the qualitative is reduced to the quantitative in the observation of nature, it is the same structural change in attitude toward things as when commodity production takes the place of production of goods for one's own needs. Just as the world of goods, which still comprises in the natural economy all sorts of qualitatively distinct goods qualitatively distinguished as use values, is seen in the capitalist system from its commodity-aspect alone, which is to say as merely an equivalent for a numerically specifiable amount of money, so do, for this inclination of consciousness, all things and later also all human beings appear ever more and in growing measure transformed: they appear only in so far as they can be taken into account by a rationalistic calculability. Within the possibility and capability of seeing a qualitatively distinct good as nothing more than the expression of a quantum of money, then, there is implicitly contained a manner of relating to the world as such which simply manifests itself especially palpably in the quantifying we have first traced in the natural-scientific mode of thought. But the same change in attitude also occurs with regard to human beings: while the Other is, in a patriarchally or feudally organized world, somehow a totality or at least a part of a hierarchically ordered community,5 he is, in a commodity-producing society, nothing but himself a commodity, his labor- power a magnitude specifiable in numbers, which one takes into account just as one does other quantities. 4. All such investigations doubtless go back to Marx's Capital, and especially to the chapter in Volume I entitled "The Fetishism of Commodities." Simmel, for instance, has richly charac- terized the change in the manner of experiencing the objects of the world which come into the world with the money-form (Philosophy of Money). But in doing so he took the capitalist money-form quite unhistorically out of its capitalist context and imputed the characteristic structural change to "money as such." Sombart and Max Weber, among others, have also spoken of a progressive process of rationalization which reaches its culmination in the modern age, but they have still not brought into view what is most essential, that there have been rationalisms in earlier times and also monetary calculation, but that the category of commodity became the uni- versal category forming a whole presentation of the world peculiarly in modern capitalism and only there. This had already been seen by Marx and has been elaborated by Lukacs in his essay, "Reification and the consciousness of the proletariat," in History and Class Consciousness. 5. "No matter, then, what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people them- selves in this society (in the Middle Ages-K.M.), the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labor, appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations, and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labor" (Marx, 1914:44; here quoted from Marx, 1967:77). 418</page><page sequence="7">It is not as if the psychological possibility of relating to other human beings and to objects as to other than equivalents for money were henceforth elimi- nated, or as if any individual member of the aspiring bourgeoisie always found himself only on this level of world experience. But from now on, the possibility exists of entering into the world from this direction, consistently and in prin- ciple. That the calculating attitude is to be sociologically imputed to the aspir- ing bourgeoisie does not amount at all to a notion of reality (which would be incorrect as such) according to which every individual bourgeois always main- tains this attitude towards his environment, but it amounts simply to the claim that a systematically consistent and fundamentally novel inclination towards quantifying everything in the world was brought into the realm of possibility out of the will brought to the world by this new stratum, which had borne the rise of capitalism. Other strata can also share this attitude and increasingly adopt this way of relating to the world; but it will be ever more dominant, steadily repressing all other tendencies, specifically in that stratum which is placed directly amid relationships of this kind by the life's work which occupies its everyday existence, the stratum for which this world, which it created, be- comes immediate environment. But the more spheres of life are drawn into this attitude, the more does this existential and cognitive frame of reference repress the remaining, time-honored modes of relating to the world; so that, in the end, when philosophical reflection turns to the relationships between man and envi- ronment, this reflection bases itself on this ground, hypostatizes this calculating-rational way of relating as the only relationship, and in so far as other relationships remain visible to it at all, denies them their worth. To this doctrine of knowledge, then, any way of learning about the world that does not proceed analogously to quantification appears inferior, pre-scientific, subjective or restricted to the external appearance of things. But the other factor we have singled out also has its sociologically deter- mined background. We designated this factor as the coupling of universal validity with the criterion of truth, and it rested upon the presupposition that man really knows only in so far as what he learns is demonstrable to all-in sum, the moverfent from personal and communally-bound certainties to truths valid for all men. What is going on here is the process from the state of commu- nity to the state of society, which also expresses itself in the concept of truth.6 The steady expansion in the organization of communications technique, the de- mocratization accompanying the newly rising capitalism here become manifest in the conception of knowledge. The appearance of saving certainties bound to personal life, the phenomenon of revealed truth bound to communities are still known to religious consciousness. For the capitalist world the communal subject falls away and there remains, on the one hand, the isolated individual, and, on the other, the "consciousness as such" that dwells within him. For this reason, from now on, we also find as starting point for epistemological construction the ego, as given immediately and in isolation (the ego, but not the personal "I"), 6. This is only to claim that there is present a sociological attribution-relationship between the mod- ern striving for universally valid truths and the democratic principle, but not that the thought of universal validity could not occur historically in other social settings as well. 419</page><page sequence="8">and we find the ascent from here to "consciousness as such"-whereby this type of thought skips various concrete stages of collective consciousness ("We"-consciousness). The aspiring bourgeoisie thus turned one sphere of knowledge into the para- digm for knowledge as such, and they elaborated this tendency in their logical reflections to the exaggerated exclusion of any other. In this rationalizing fervor it was not seen that there are spheres of knowledge which could not be adapted to this manner of thinking, so sharply pointed toward quantification; that there are methods of thinking and modes of knowing that differ from this structural model, and which are bound to elude methodological reflections if assessed by the criteria of the exact sciences. But it is naturally only reflective methodology that these methods of thinking elude; real life naively continued to employ methods of knowing incomprehensible to the official logic. In everyday life, men continued to have physiognomic knowledge-that is, learning that does not emerge on grounds of dissection and analysis but owes its assurance precisely to a holistic apprehension which first makes analysis possible; in political dealings, men continued to act on the basis of renderings of situations and to accumulate sociological impressions rooted in them. This last is a mode of learning too, which gains its distinctiveness from being rooted in situations. While natural- scientific knowledge abstracts completely from the specific situation of the knowing subject, practical-political knowledge gains its distinctive character precisely from the fact that it gains knowledge from within situations and acts with situations in view. Where theory lacks general rules and lawful regulari- ties, the practical actor knows enough to act on the basis of the situation; and while general rules could teach anything except in which concrete situation one happens to be placed at the moment, the capacity of the concrete, pre-scientific practical actor consists in bringing the facts given into an order relevant to him- self and to his own situation, by means of the category "situation." What kind of thinking is at work here? Is it the thinking we have been discussing? Is it altogether identical in structure with natural-scientific thinking? This is just where the problem lies. This species of neglected forms and methods of knowing has re-emerged as a problem for us just at this time, and our foremost preoccu- pation consists in somehow comprehending the methodological problems as well as the sociologically determined fate of this style of thought, only now becoming truly visible, on the basis of this recognition. This step must be ventured, even though, since the preparatory work could not yet be done, mistakes must occur. It also cannot escape notice that natural-scientific psychology, which was to have become the basic science for all the humanistic sciences, however precise it may be becoming, offers nothing to the historian or literary historian engaged in concrete work, while the so-called vulgar psychology has enabled him to un- dertake, with its unmeditated methods, the most sensitive psychological descrip- tions and analyses. What methods is life employing here? Again we must ask: is the thinking in use the same as that which we portrayed methodologically on the model of the exact natural sciences? Where fixed prejudices about the meaning of knowledge are loosened, and knowledge is no longer presumed to be present only where knowledge of laws can be had, the revision of the concept of knowledge moves ever further afield and more than one type of concept is also found. It is not only the concept estab- lished by definition which secures knowledge; there are also "naming" and "de- 420</page><page sequence="9">scribing" concepts which secure learning by means of their interrelationships and must be understood in contrast to the defined concept. Once entered upon this path, we are bound also to recognize that the indi- vidual can be grasped in its individuality and that it can even be articulated- and not only so far as it partakes of universal concepts and subjection to univer- sal laws; that a living Other belongs to us not only so far as it can be dissolved into relations; that we partake of spiritual and sensual learning whose substance we grasp directly and allow to affect us at a single contact. It is bound to come to our attention, in other words, that there is a wide undercurrent of knowledge about whose methods we are not yet able to give ourselves an accounting. Rationalism, in essence oriented to quantification, shrugged these problems off with a summary gesture of contempt by terming this species of knowledge "pre-scientific." But it failed to remark that this is exactly where the problem lies. How does one proceed in these pre-scientific methods of knowledge? How do insights come about, able to provide at least an orientation for action? How is this "pre-scientific way of knowing" distinguished from the allegedly "only scientific way?" In time the call must arise for a methodological doctrine, a the- ory of knowing the qualitative. By "qualitative thinking" we mean at this point to designate, as with a slogan, everything in the complex of that alternative style of thought we have just characterized, just as the expression "quantitative natural-scientific thought" served us as an abbreviated, summary designation which we could fix more exactly only in the course of our presentation. This problem of qualitative and situation-bound thinking could not but become ever more urgent since history, a field increasingly taking the shape of a science, em- ployed just these methods in all its parts; and indeed the problem of the left- over, hidden species of knowledge became unavoidable for methodology, which is primarily directed to the exploration of scientific thought, in the contrast be- tween natural and humanistic sciences. We believe that we can discern an even more far-reaching difference among possible "styles of thought" in this contest over method (Methodenstreit) and dualism. This is not to dispute the ultimate unity of consciousness or even of thought. In our present context and in the light of the present-day task, however, it is not as important for us to go in search of this unity as it is to see, first of all, the hidden differences within this unity. As is well-known, it was for Vico that the problem of history first became visible in a striking way; but their rationalism neither he nor the Enlightenment - whose accomplishments in the study of history have also been recognized by the late Kilthey-could bring the whole problem complex into view. Even the Dantian system, the most grandiose philosophical system in the line of enlight- ened rationalism,was oriented to the exact natural sciences, as is now well enough acknowledged, in an altogether one-sided way; and little could be drawn from it for a theory of history and historical knowing. When the methodological problems of history first came up for solution, attempts were made to answer the questions within the framework of Kantian philosophy. It was asked wheth- er it would not be possible to design, through additions and corrections, a methodology and logic of history which would on the whole uphold the Kantian scheme and formulation of the questions. This experiment was performed by Windelband and then especially by Rickert, but much as the contrast between two types of knowledge (universa- lizing natural sciences and individualizing history) was made the axis around 421</page><page sequence="10">which their studies turned, the problem cannot be seen in its full breadth in this way because the philosophical background, the specification, and the character- ization of intellectual attainment are still attempted on the basis of a philosoph- ical position which has taken up into the philosophy of thought the very presuppositions it would have been its first task to overcome, if it were really to uncover the distinctive properties of the methods of thinking which are distinc- tively not like natural-scientific knowledge. The starting point alone, how the problem is approached, closes off, in our opinion, the possibility of a fundamental solution to the questions relevant here. Methodology is assigned the task of showing the difference between the two sciences strictly on the level of the known, that which knowledge produces, on the level of concept formation. It cannot be surprising, then, that the whole dif- ference is seen in the fact that the one intellectual tendency (designated as natural-scientific) proceeds in a generalizing, and the other (the historical) in an individualizing way. Is this powerful distinction really to consist in nothing but the employment of different types of concepts in the one and the other? The way to a substantial methodology is also barred because ontological inquiry is brought in belatedly, and then only very inadequately; that is, the inquiry whether the object of the natural sciences differs from that of history in its mode of being. Although the still useful ontological distinction between the world of nature bare of meaning and the world of meaningful forms (culture) is actually seen, instead of allowing this distinction to subsist as an ontological one, it is too emphatically attached to the subjective activity of the knower. An- other ontological, premethodological question is not touched: whether it is not the case that the knowing subject stands in an altogether different relationship to the object in the cultural sciences than he does in the natural sciences, where laws are sought. In addition, a whole series of other assumptions, to be discussed later, make this way to a solution appear unsatisfactory to us.7 The error of this line of investigation does not lie, on our judgment, in the individual argumentations, but in the starting points, the rationalistic premises and prejudices which had come into it out of the rationalistic tradition of en- lightenment even before the initiation of methodological inquiry. The method- ological elucidation of the methods of knowing which are distinctly not like the exact natural sciences can come only out of a tradition which derived its philo- sophical and experiential foundations from the tendency which is preserved in the historical disciplines, as well as living in the "prescientific modes of knowing" which continue to assert themselves in everyday life. Despite the relative paucity of their findings, the great significance of Dilthey's methodological writings consists in the fact that they attempt to grasp this same problem of the distinctive properties of knowledge in the humanistic sciences upon philosophical grounds more congenial to those disciplines. Dilthey is borne by, and may be the most important exponent of that irrationalistic undercurrent which first became self-aware in Romanticism, and which, in the neo-Romanticism of the present, is on the way, in altered form, to effecting its counter-attack against bourgeois rationalism. In order to fully appreciate the 7. In the next chapter we shall have the opportunity, primarily in the introductory parts of each sec- tion, to pursue in detail the differences of principle between the two methodologies. 422</page><page sequence="11">methodological achievement and especially in order to see the wider sociological and philosophy-of-history ground from which these ways of setting questions arise, it is as necessary in this case as it was with rationalism to widen our field of vision with regard to the history of the problem. We have already seen how modern rationalism, which hypostatized one of the possible modes of attending and knowing as the paradigm of all knowledge by refining and rendering absolute one type of knowledge (that of the so-called exact natural sciences), constructed its theory of knowledge, its philosophy as a whole from this starting point. But it is always important to keep in mind that modern natural-scientific knowledge was not the "first cause" of this process of transformation, which went so far as to determine the new shape of philosophy, but that the new scientific orientation and the new philosophy ultimately repre- sent aspects of the redirection in psychology and world-view with regard to man, things, and world which marked a new type of man. The distinctive atti- tude towards nature, where every personal and immediate relationship to her is to be given up, so that she can be ultimately transmuted into quantities or at least into a nexus of objective concepts, deprived of every subjectively present and concretely communal association, is a redirection which gradually took ef- fect in all the modes of conduct of capitalist man. If one man was at one time, as long as the feeling of community analyzed by Tonnies was still sufficiently vital, a concrete individual for another, and a unified totality in a certain situation, a striving becomes ever more evident now, to regard him as abstract individual or to comprehend him merely in his function in a universal process, by depersonalizing him altogether, as a conductor, say, or mailman, or party to a contract. The possibilities for reducing all organic relationships to contractual form, depersonalized property and capital, and enterprises in the form of joint stock companies can only be come upon by way of this new manner of relating, which eliminates everything that is qualitatively distinctive. (Sombart, 1916). In this abstract relationship to the Other, however, the abstract, so-called epis- temological subject is already present in essence. The point of departure for the natural law doctrine of the time, which aimed at formal democracy, also em- ploys this "man as such" within us, who is removed from every concrete situa- tion of rank or family or anything else. That the same impersonal relationship increasingly emerged with regard to the world of things as well, in contrast to an earlier world where property was something personal and, accordingly, inte- grated into the existential domain, so to speak, of each individual, had been al- ready observed by the Romantics and played off by them against the present, to the advantage of earlier times. The change in the cognitive relationship of men can only be explained on the basis of this general change in the existential relationship among these same men, and in the relationship between men and things. For it is commonly overlooked-and this will later be taken as the crux of our study-that while every instance of knowing is simply knowledge when viewed from the "inside," it simultaneously refers, when viewed from the "outside," to a specific existen- tial relationship between the knowing subject and the object known.8 It is only 8. The advantage of looking at knowledge from the point of view of existence is active in Kierkegaard and in the representatives of the phenomenological school. Our essay in the sociolog- 423</page><page sequence="12">when one has grasped this fact of inner connection between thinking and exist- ence that one has cleared one's way to the questions posed by the sociology of thought, because it is only from this vantage point that one can see how new ex- istential relationships among men and between men and things make possible and underlie cognitive relationships of a type which is correspondingly new. Now that we have seen, by these means, that a certain rationalism, as a form of thought, belongs to capitalism's "reifying" manner of living, as a form of existence, and that the methodological doctrine which is part of this style of thought shares in the existential presuppositions it contains, it is time to ask what happened, in the course of history, to the existential relationships and to the cognitive relationships corresponding to them, which were repressed by the style of thought we have been considering. They still endured; but, as is often the case in history, their existence be- came latent and asserted itself, at most, in counter-currents complementary to the main stream. The counter-currents were at first assumed and transmitted by the spiritual and social strata which were not drawn into the capitalist ra- tionalization process, or, at least, were not its carriers. The earlier, personal, concrete human relationships remained alive in the peasant ranks, in the ranks of the lower middle class which stayed in historical continuity with artisan expe- rience, and in the traditions of the nobility (in different forms and levels of intensity, which could, in each case, be made phenomenologically more precise). The largely implicit and unbroken tradition of the religious sects (like those of pietism),9 notably retained a bearing towards life, an attitude to life, and methods for taking things in, with regard to the inner life, above all, which was bound to disappear from the style of life of the bourgeoisie, the more it was drawn into the capitalist process, and also from the life of the industrial workers. But not even the latter two strata, in the foremost rank of those committed to the capitalistically rationalized process, have altogether abandoned the origi- nal bearing towards life; this bearing simply disappeared from the foreground, so to speak, of public and official life. Intimate relationships, so far as they are untouched by the capitalist process, continue to run their course in a manner which is not calculating or rationalist. Just this phenomenon of such spheres (suffused with personal and religious feeling) which had earlier (as Max Weber has already pointed out) been matters of public concern, becoming intimate, is a development complementary to the thoroughgoing rationalization of public life, the work place, the market, politics, etc. In this way, the "irrational" (which is closer to the original relationship of man to man and man to thing) henceforth limits itself to the "periphery" of in- dividual life in a double sense: first, inasmuch as that which is alive vibrates only in the intimate relationships of human beings, while experiences having ical theory of thinking emerges from this tendency, taken to its logical conclusion in that one pro- ceeds from a social existence which is dynamically changing and not from the existence of the in- dividual. 9. On this see Unger ( 1911 ) and Nadler ( 1921 ). On the strata supporting the Romantic movement see Salomon (1922) and also Oppenheimer (I 922:3ff). 424</page><page sequence="13">public standing are ever more rationally structured; and second, in the strict so- ciological sense, as the strata upon which the new world rests (the bourgeoisie and the proletariat) immerse themselves, with an ever wider proportion of their consciousness, in the new style of thinking and being, and as life is lived on the strength of the old seminal elements and traditions only on the periphery of the new world-in peasant life, in the life of the nobility, and in that of the petit bourgeoisie. Here, on the periphery in two senses, slumber the seeds of a style of living and thinking that once constituted the world. These seeds were long latent, and they only became a "tendency," something "to be noticed" later, when they were fostered in the social struggle, when the forces of counter-revolution resurrected these repressed elements of experiencing and thinking and fastened them to their standards. It is the sociological significance of Romanticism that, as a reaction against the thinking of the Enlightenment (against this philosophical proponent of capi- talism) at the level of experience, it took up the decaying earlier substantive themes, consciously spelled them out, and opposed them to the rationalistic style of thought. Romanticism took up the very spheres of life and bearing towards life which still survived as nothing more than residual counter-currents, and over which bourgeois rationalism was threatening to trample. Romanticism set itself the task of rescuing precisely these, bestowing a new dignity on them, and preventing their demise. The experiences bound to community were in- voked, in various forms, against the manifestations of society (to characterize the state of things in Tonnies' terminology): family against contract, emotional certainties against rationality, inner modes of knowing against mechanistic ones. All the substances and contents which had hitherto invisibly given shape to the substratum of life suddenly come into view for reflexive scrutiny. And they are fought for. Since, as is well-known, Romanticism grew out of the Enlightenment as antithesis to a thesis,'? and is conditioned by its thesis like every antithesis, it is the paradoxical fate of Romanticism that even as counter-current it is condi- tioned structurally in its foundations by the attitudes and methods of the En- lightenment, which occasioned it. Romanticism sought to rescue these repressed irrational forces of life by fostering them, but failed to realize that paying them conscious attention at the same time rationalized them. It accomplished a feat of rationalization which the bourgeois-rationalist Enlightenment could never have carried out, not only because its methods were inadequate for this, but also because the contents 10. Oppenheimer (1922) recommends the expression "spiritual counter-revolution" instead of "Romanticism" and wants to refer its origins, from the standpoint of semantic genealogy, to Tarde's principle of "imitation par opposition." There would be nothing objectionable in this if it were not that Romanticism contains, in addition to mere negation, something positive distinctly its own, namely the accumulated positive matter of sunken epochs (as Oppenheimer recognizes, by the way). We must therefore distinguish two factors in Romanticism: one factor by virtue of which it appears as spiritual countermovement against the Enlightenment (on all these points it is conditioned by the opponent against which it struggles), and secondly, its function as heir to a style of thinking and living repressed by capitalism. 425</page><page sequence="14">themselves were not active enough to hold their attention. It is simply the fate of even the irrational that it could only be grasped from the level forming the element basic to the age. Romanticism is thus a capturing and collecting of the elements of life and the bearing towards life which ultimately derived from the religious conscious- ness and were pushed aside by the capitalist-rationalist onmarch; but it is a seizing and a collecting and taking in of these elements at the level of reflection. What Romanticism accomplishes is by no means a belated reconstitution of the Middle Ages, religion, and the irrational as foundation and bedrock of life, but rather a comprehension of these contents by reflection, rendering them visible, securing knowledge of them. But Romanticism thereby accomplishes something that was not at all its aim: it developed methods, modes of knowing, conceptual possibilities, language adapted to rendering into theory all the forces of life which would always elude the Enlightenment. Here, then, all the elements, bearing towards life, and attitudes towards man, things, and world which had been eclipsed for a whole epoch were once again conjured up; but they were not conjured up in their quality as an underearthly creator of existence, as humus, but rather as a task, as content of a resolution. After all these contents had materialized at the level of reflection and had been rendered visible, they entered, as is known, into alliances, viewed sociologi- cally, with anticapitalist social currents." All the social strata without interest in the capitalist process or even threat- ened with ruin, which were also traditionally associated with the submerged world-forms of various medieval phases-in short, living in a greater proximity, determined by tradition, to these contents-used the discovery of these contents against the bourgeoisie and the industrial world. Entrepreneurship and enlightened monarchy had, by virtue of their historical interconnectedness, if for no other reason, an interest in rationalism; feudal forces, as well as small peasant proprietorship and petit bourgeois layers arising out of the traditions of artisanship and guild, possessed, in differing degrees, a sense for and interest in the Romantic (Salomon, 1922). These strata already do their part in the emer- gence of these contents as matter for reflective knowledge; but it is especially during the socially conditioned struggle over culture, where it is a matter of ap- plying these contents, that the proponents of these strata carry their takings from Romanticism into their ideologies. It is well-known, for instance, that the coming to awareness of national feeling was nourished by such romantic ele- ments. After the diffusion of the Romantic offensive, which was at the same time its self-dissolution, the second half of the nineteenth century brings a renewed sweep by the rationalism oriented to natural science, and it draws ever broader social strata within its orbit, just as mature capitalism has engaged ever broader 11. Gottfried Salomon (1922:15) has pregnantly epitomized the lifeline of Romanticism as follows: "Romanticism is a movement that parallels the Reformation and Renaissance. It grows in reli- gious soil, i.e., pietism and mysticism, becomes aesthetic and political rationalism and terminates in Catholicism, which like classicism is an international phenomenon. Belief in the mission of the German spirit led to drawing on the Middle Ages as an apology for the past. Here, too, the idea of a rebirth, a 'renaissance,' is linked with Restoration and reaction." 426</page><page sequence="15">strata in its world-forming structure. In this floodtide of rationalism, romantic experience and thought had once again to sink under. But its dissolution was not complete: in the succession of historiography, in the traditions and methods of historicism, which grew out of the Romantic inheritance, the repressed elements survived. They re-emerged in irrationalist currents within philosophy, and today offer the breeding ground and starting point for the new counterthrust into neo-Romanticism, which shapes the environment within which we now find ourselves. This antirationalist interest, nourished by Romantic stuff, which cultivates a way of being attuned to things, world, and knowledge which is different from rationalism, can increasingly be seen today in diverse tendencies. It survives in anti-Kantian philosophy, in the line of succession from Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Bergson, Dilthey, to Simmel, as well as in the historicism of Troeltsch, but beyond that has come altogether to be the philosophical bedrock of the phenomenological school.'2 It should be noted, however, that this reappearance of Romantic irration- alist elements, as we have them today, is once more co-determined by the state of rationalism itself, as counter-current to which it once more appears today. If the irrational, the reviving religious consciousness, presented itself at the stage of reflection under the conditions of Romanticism, and if therefore the special achievement of Romanticism consisted in having discovered and rationalized contents overlooked in the Enlightenment, unconsciously having applied new methods in this rationalization, then the creativeness of the present epoch does not by any means consist in taking up the old posture once more, making newly accessible for our age contents additional to those already grasped by Roman- ticism but once again submerged during the naturalistic epoch of the second half of the nineteenth century. On closer inspection, all the discoveries of neo-Romanticism appear as rediscoveries. They are for the most part contents which Romanticism had already grasped and which are novel only for our gen- eration, a generation which grew up in the period of positivism. It is upon quite a different level that present-day neo-Romanticism achieves something new: in its methodological reflections, which address the knowability of these irrational elements. Romanticism had discovered the methods by means of which one can know the irrational, but it possessed an interest in its own methods only in rudimentary form. It was still more or less naive in this respect. Now we possess the irrational elements not only upon one reflective level, but upon the stage of a double reflection. This is the place of our productivity; this is where our genuine accomplishments get under way. The fact that we possess the irrational elements, the contents of the religious and, later, of the romantic consciousness, at the stage of methodological reflec- tion is also due to the fact that the rational-Enlightenment line of succession in our philosophy has run out of its system-building power, so to speak, within the revitalized German idealism of our time, and that this philosophy has turned 12. Modern phenomenology amalgamates two layers: a rationalistic systematics, which asserts itself in the ontology, and an irrationalist, fundamental attitude, which comes into effect in the distinc- tively phenomenological portions. 427</page><page sequence="16">into a methodology. In the age of Romanticism, the critical philosophy, as well as the idealism which carried it forward were productive, if only along rational- ist lines, in creating a depiction of the world. The new forward movement of idealist philosophy into neo-Kantianism, neo-Fichteanism, and neo- Hegelianism approached the philosophies of their models from the very outset impelled by methodological interests. Neither Kantianism nor Hegelianism is useful to us in its substantive affirmations. No neo-Kantian or neo-Hegelian intends to revive Kant or Hegel word for word; i.e., no one wants to make the positive contents of these philosophies credible once again. It is always rather a matter of rediscovering the fruitfulness of systematic points of departure, the fruitfulness of the methods of these philosophies. But that means that the newly reconstituted idealism, heir to the rationalist line, took up only that which had relevance to method: and even though they did begin to philosophize anew from these points of departure, all will have to admit that the material, substantial filling out of the systematic frameworks gained in this way displays no genu- inely productive power of creating anew, and that they have not succeeded at all in figuring out, in terms of their systems, the world which has since come into being.'3 In this respect as well it is new that our creativity resides in skill and clear- sightedness with regard to logical structures. That is to say that our poverty in lacking a substantive philosophy of our own has its positive side in that we are in a position to see, to an unprecedented degree, the systematic framework, the logical structure of all systematizations. We can penetrate to the way in which -from a purely logical point of view-the philosophical systems are built up, where the ultimate points of departure for philosophies are to be found, what types of systematizations may have been possible at all, etc. We see connections which ages more substantively productive and philosophically creative could not see, in part because they were too much caught up in their own philosophy to look beyond its contours (and so could at most try to assimilate or to controvert the other standpoints from their own), and in part because they could not reflexively seize hold of the system itself because they had their life within its structures, within the process of systematizing. The relationships obtaining here are similar to those in our dealings with art: we have become productive in the history of styles only because we similarly do not possess in art a style of our own, dominating the epoch to the exclusion of others. We see stylistic connec- tions, lines of development, and the like, because we lack a distinctive style of 13. Where the sociological sources for this methodologism may be located cannot be readily estab- lished beyond doubt. One can make a beginning by recourse to contributing factors and, thus, de- rive the methodological attitude from the predominance of the technical spirit, whose basic for- mula is "how it is made." On the other hand, this methodologism also doubtless flows from the spirit of positivism, whose primary characteristic is the decomposing of comprehensive science into distinct disciplines and which cannot allow philosophy to count as more than a science of method. It is doubtless superfluous to emphasize that the same spirit rules Kantianism in this respect as does Positivism, inasmuch as it is also familiar with the dualism between particular dis- ciplines, on the one hand, and logic (in the form of theory of knowledge and methodology), on the other. We have come far enough to be able to discern the contours of this positivist- methodological spirit, but not so far as to be able to transcend this stage without further ado, at a single "leap." 428</page><page sequence="17">our own and because there occur, in our time, stylistic changes at a remarkable rate of succession, although they are, for the most part, simply stylistic repeti- tions. This also makes it possible to explain how it is that the creative artist of our time sets about his work with an attitude different from that of the artist of past epochs. The artist of our time has already absorbed much of the attitude of the critic and historian of style. It is not only that he is knowledgeable about styles, but also that he actually creates with certain styles in view, instead of liv- ing spontaneously within one of them. A shift in the creative power and creative centre of an epoch comes together with such a shift in the total basis. Creative productivity wanders, from age to age, among the various cultural domains, and, as long as there does not set in among us a naive affirmation of philosophi- cal substance similar to religious affirmation, the creative field of endeavor in philosophy (the demand of the hour) will be found only in the spheres of methodological theory and logic, and, ultimately, in structural analysis. If, then, our philosophy as a whole moves on a level of double reflection, on the level of methodology, and if, in accord with this there is, as we saw, a clear- sightedness regarding structures of objective formations in the rationalistic line of development, there is correspondingly, in the line of the irrationalist tend- ency, a comparable clearsightedness regarding subjective irrational elements, the modalities of subjective consciousness, from which the various objective for- mations have sprung. Phenomenology, as the study of attitudes of conscious- ness, a study of the typical modalities of the subject as a whole, is simply an ex- tended rationalizing of all the factors which precede objectification and out of which objectification first emerges. Phenomenology, directed towards total con- sciousness and towards the attitude of subjects, is in this manner the counter- part to that structural analysis which has developed in the rationalistic line of succession as a sort of logic of objective cultural formations. As long as these two types of inquiry are carried on in isolation and are not set into a broader framework, they remain individual specialized studies. They turn into a new type of philosophical regarding of the world, however, as soon as they are em- ployed as parts of a striving for a totality to comprehend the world. It is, however, questionable nowadays whether there exist any starting points in our consciousness which give promise of a positive affirmation of our own, able to give shape to the world. (And we must pursue these questions about the spiritual condition of the age, since we have already gone so far in raising the question of "where we stand.") Many will deny that there are such points and will insist that we have our existence in an age of complete relativity, and that what we have said so far would have to confirm this, unless there were something to be added. We had ourselves insisted, after all, that our entire pro- ductivity resides in the formal; that we can see structures and phenomenological modalities only because we have no contents to hold us: that we have history of art because we have no art; and phenomenology of religion because we have no religion-or, at most, an unfulfilled intention to have them. Others will, in con- trast, take precisely the presence of such intentions regarding religion, meta- physics, and, indeed, positive affirmations in general as point of departure for their interpretation of the age, and they will insist that this intention is already half a fulfillment, and they will promulgate "the leap" and strike a prophetic pose to stand for some positive affirmation to transcend the present state. But this manner of overcoming the situation is, in our judgment, a false and 429</page><page sequence="18">inauthentic one; and there is a criterion for making this judgment; it always turns out on closer inspection of these affirmations (be they Catholic or Hu- manist), that there is only talk about them, but that the actual presentation of the affirmations demanded in abstraction is simply not there. The whole broad spectrum of essay literature that puts itself forward as unrelativistic because "religious" and "affirmative" can only be understood by reference to this unfulfilled intention towards affirmation; and its "leap" is the "quick heroic deed" (of which Dostoyevsky speaks) through which some indi- vidual may comfort himself amid the discomfort of his seeking for a world-view. But these slogans have no significance for the age, because they are not capable of overcoming organically the stage of contemporary consciousness, from which these thinkers themselves have suffered as much as anyone. As far as this first manner of overcoming the present situation is concerned -that is, the unaltered acceptance of past affirmations, as neo-Catholicism, for instance, seeks to do-this movement is not to be thought inauthentic simply because it attempts a recapturing of past contents. Most cultural innovations began as reinterpretations of past contents: thus, the Reformation was a reinter- pretation of the Bible, and Classicism, a reinterpretation of classical antiquity. But there is also a criterion for judging whether such a reinterpretation is essen- tially creative or in fact merely imitative. While it turns out in the case of every creative reinterpretation that the "return to the old" was merely a cloak, the productive self-deception of a consciousness seeking the new, the return which amounts to mere repetition is characterized by the absence of genuinely new contents. Creative epochs were naive, especially in what they were about. That is why they could become productive: the return to the Bible became a new reli- gion only because the tensions of the time were taken up in the reinterpretation; and Classicism became a new art, a new style, manifestation of a distinctive artistic volition (Kunstwollen) because the reinterpretation was not a philologi- cal but a newly creative one. With our reinterpreters, however, the acceptance of the old actually takes place at the level of interpretative historical research, and they falsify too little to get something really new under way, taking up the tensions of the present, and they falsify too much to be at least fruitful as histo- rians. The same applies to the other type of overcomers of the present, who merely talk about the religious and do not, in the last analysis, so much propa- gate religious contents as offer contributions to religious phenomenology as a science. They could become good scientists, because their and our religious intentionality would be sufficient to understand the historical forms of religious "outward from the inside," but they are poorly equipped for this phenomenolog- ical work, because their scientific disinterestedness is constantly marred by dog- matic contents which insinuate themselves. Shall we then remain in this state of suspension, in a state where relativity is already in principle overcome and made untenable, and where the intention towards positive affirmation is already present, without, however, finding ful- fillment? That would not be the worst thing. One could accept this as fated and at least give recognition to the authenticity of such a way of bearing oneself (the solution of Max Weber and Karl Jaspers). But there is a way out, even here. And the real way out of a situation for consciousness always arises by virtue of the fact that one has followed the designated road completely to its end, that one does not consciously make leaps but instead has confidence that the matter 430</page><page sequence="19">will in the end transcend itself on its own. And it does in fact transcend itself. The primary source of our relativism is our historicism, which has taught us to see all positive affirmations as historically conditioned, and to comprehend and interpret all contents-religious, artistic, or philosophical-as parts of a total situation, and, ultimately, of a total movement. It is a fact that historicism, this mightiest heir of Romantic consciousness, is at once the cause of our utter dissolution, our relativism, and the only means capable of extricating us from this state. First of all, historicism is the positive framework which provides a home and a context of meaning for our methodological analyses (be they structural ana- lyses of objectivized formations or phenomenological analyses of the modes of subjective bearing which pertain to them). It is only thanks to historicism that at least the part of the world which we master in the study of our history does not appear to us as a senseless succession of events and forms, but that the posi- tive penetration of the world can get under way for us spontaneously and naively at this place at least. Here, inside methodological analysis, philosophy and depiction of the world emerge unforced, albeit at first historical depiction of the world. Philosophy lives at first within specialized studies; it is not program- matic any more, but actualizes itself without being intended, spontaneously, in the form of a world-view which fulfills us. What must be seen next is that one cannot pursue methodology and the an- alysis of world-views at length without aspiring, at the same time or in the end, towards a totality, without arriving in the vicinity of a metaphysics of history- but this time one which is not contrived, but follows as spontaneous result of our critical consideration of the world. By this turn of things, historicism, which had begun by relativizing everything, becomes, behind our backs, a philosophy of history-not one thought up by some individual, but one which emerges out of the historical-sociological researches of generations. Since historicism offers a formal framework for all the investigations which at first come out isolated and scattered, occurring as analyses of world-views, structural analyses of cultural formations, phenomenological analyses of the various psychological types and modes of subjective bearing which are possible, it unites these dispersed efforts into planful work, in which they mutually complement one another and finally metamorphose, within this consolidated casing, into a content-rich philosophy of history. That is to say that they become the means for genuine philosophical penetration of the world. 431</page><page sequence="20">References Cassirer, Ernst 1911 "Die Enstehung der exakten Wissenschaft" ("The emergence of exact science").
