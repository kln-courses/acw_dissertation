<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nachrichten / News and Notes National Indian Confédération Founded MEXICO, D.F. (IAII). An outcome of the Congress of the National Council of Indian Peoples, held June 24 to 26,1987, in Amealco, Querétaro, Mexico, was the founding of the National Indian Confédération. This body is to serve as a forum for dealing with problems facing indigenous peoples in the social, political and economic spheres. Under instruc tions from the Mexican President, Miguel de la Madrid, assistance will come from the National Indigenist Institute (INI), whose declared aim is the harmonizing of indigenous cultural values with the need for progress, and from the National Confédération of Campesinos (CNC). Latin American Indian Parliament Created MEXICO, D.F. (IAII). The Ist Meeting of Latin American Indian Legislators, which was held from August 26 to 29, 1987, in Panama City, Panama, was the arena for detailed discussion by a panel of 23 indigenous legislators of a number of important issues affecting indigenous Latin Americans. A significant outcome of this Conference was a resolution esta blishing the Latin American Indian Parliament, an instru ment for the international defence of Indian rights. Récogni tion of the Parliament will be sought from ail Latin American nations. A primary aim of the new body is to function as the représentative of indigenous peoples vis-à-vis both national and international organizations. The participants to the Ist Meeting announced the "Declaración de Panama", which advocates the pursuit of indigenous goals through peaceful means within the framework of democracy. The 2nd Meeting^ of Latin American Indian Legislators is to take place in Nicaragua in 1988. Belize: Archaeological activities in 1986-1987 BELMOPAN (Belizean Bullet/mex). The Department of Archaeology reports on the following activities: - SARTENEJA: In November 1986 Raul Valencia of the Department of Archaeology at Belmopan, accompanied by Elias Alfaro, Foreman of Works and leading Belizean expert on the consolidation of sites, began work on the consolidation of a Postclassic structure at the site of Sarteneja (see MEXICON 9:3). - COLHA (Dir. by Thomas R. Hester, University of Texas at San Antonio, and Eleanor King, University of Pennsyl vania): The seventh and final season of work here ( 1987) focused on identifying the Late Classic chertworkers at Colha and their role in its society. In particular, three areas were inves tigated: a simple housemound, a housemound with lithic^ Workshop, and an elite patio group. At the housemound with™ lithic Workshop two burials were discovered, the first known in connection with such a Workshop. The elite patio group also contained several burials, and traces of an Early Post classic occupation were unearthed there, the first known out side the center of the site. The excavations as a whole revealed marked variability in the status of the Late Classic inhabitants of Colha, from the apparently lowly residents of the simple housemound, to the comparatively high-status chertworkers of the housemound with lithic Workshop, to the elite inhabi tants of the patio group. Work was also completed on a small temple in the center of the site, where a beautifully preserved Late Classic struc ture with apron molding was partially uncovered. - CUELLO (Dir. by Dr. Norman Hammond, Rutgers Uni versity, N.J.): The 1987 season at Cuello was devoted to the gathering of a large number of radiocarbon samples and of evidence of diet and ecological patterns from numerous flotation samples and animal bones, and to further analysis of the functions of Early and Middle Preclassic buildings, with the goal of reconstruc</page><page sequence="2">► ting the ecology and economy for the period 700-400 B.C. The excavation concentrated on the 1980 North Square, where pottery as early as the Swasey Phase (pre-1000 B.C.) was brought to light. In the SE quarter of the excavation area a subrectangular building facing onto a courtyard to the south was uncovered. The building, which had several phases, was eut back on its west, north and, probably, south sides in its final phase. Numerous fragments of daub with impressions of poles and binding vines reveal evidence of the building's construction, while its bumt floor points to a destruction of the superstructure at some point. Under the building lay an earlier structure which, in the second of its two building phases, had a free-standing plastered wall of limestone cob bles on at least the courtyard side, and was about 10 x 4 m in area. This kind of stone-walled superstructure, dating here to c. 500 B.C., is early and innovatory, at Cuello and perhaps in the Middle Preclassic as a whole. Within were found the remains of an earlier substructure with two arcs of cobbles defining rear terraces. The original floor of the complex would seem to date to c. 700 B.C. This level will be the subject of investigation in the next season. - BRASS (Dir. by Dr. Anabel Ford, University of Califor nia at Santa Barbara): The short 1987 field season of the Belize River Archaeo logical Seulement Survey was concerned with the gathering of information on the distribution of the more imposing architectural remains within the BRASS study area (c. 300 sq. km between western Belize border and Iguana Creek to the east, and from the Belize River to a line about 15 km further north). The objective was to test interprétations of the rela tionship of soil and topography to seulement density. Activities of the season included: the locating and map ping of 19 centers and elite résidences, the seulement survey ing of two zones in areas of the good Chorro soils, the seu lement surveying of six zones in areas of the poor Beaver Dam soils, and the test excavation of the El Pilar chert biface pro duction site. The investigations revealed a close corrélation between the location of the 19 centers/residences and that of the excellent Chorro soils. In contrast, the poor Beaver Dam areas were virtually unoccupied, as anticipated. A further objective of the mapping project was to docu ment the destruction to sites caused by such activities as looting, ploughing, bulldozing, and land clearing. With re gard to the 19 sites mentioned above, at least 44 looters' tren ches were discovered, only two sites remaining untouched. The site of Barton Ramie, originally recorded in the 50's by the Harvard Peabody Museum, was recently bulldozed for ploughing. Finally, a small testing opération was conducted at El Pilar to determine the limits of its chert production site. Five small test pits were dug to bedrock and it was found that the maximum depth of the deposit was reached at 59 cm. Results of the analysis should provide data on the intensity and types of products turned out at the site and pro vide a basis for comparison with other sites. - MAINTZUNUN (Dir. by Dr. Eric Gibson, Trinity Uni versity, and Allan Moore, Dept. of Archaeology, Gov't of Belize): An archaeological field school was conducted here from March 10 to 14, 1987, under the auspices of the Dept. of Archaeology, Belize. The project focused on three goals: preparing the Stann Creek District archaeological area for future tourism, training young Belizean students in archaeo logical techniques and method, and gathering more data at the site for the archaeological record. Work at the site of Maintzunun, which consists of a large mound mass, concentrated on digging a 2 x 1 m test pit on Terrace 4, a lower terrace on the mound. This pit eut through a compact, ca. 15 cm thick, plaza/terrace floor of sand and white lime. Because of limited time, the effort focused on trying to obtain datable material. The few sherds unearthed were all of Belize Red type, dating to the Terminal Classic (ca. 800-900 A.D.), thus confirming Graham's 1983 fin dings. - BALAM HA (Dir. by Dr. Elliot Abrams, Ohio Univer sity): A new site at Tiger Run along the Sibun River in eastern Belize, Balam Ha was the subject of investigation by an Ohio University field school from December 1 to 21,1986. Tenta tive results of the study indicate that the site was once a small village of at least 30 structures with perhaps 150-400 inhabi tants at its height. It is probable that the occupants were sub sistence farmers, possibly even exporters of certain crops such as cacao. Occupation lasted from perhaps the Middle Preclassic (ca. 400 B.C.) to the Postclassic (after 1000 A.D.), the primary occupation falling in the Terminal Late Classic/ Early Postclassic (ca. 800-1100 A.D.). Sculptures in the "Mascarones" Group GRAZ (K.H.Mayer). In the course of the field work conduc ted by the Tikal Project of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, archaeologists mapped in the southwest sector of Tikal, Guatemala, in the so-called "Mun do Perdido", three small Late Classic residential structures, which were designated 6C-51,52, and 53. In December 1981, Guatemalan archaeologists with the Proyecto Nacional Tikal, under the direction of Juan Pedro Laporte, excavated the architectural complex and discovered underneath these known structures architectural features dating to the Early Classic period; they consisted of several buildings, multi chambered palace-type structures, patios, carved stairways, etc. Also discovered were altars and murais portraying ballplayers. Mask panels flanking some stairways gave the architectural group the name "Los Mascarones". Photos of two of the major architectural sculptures, a zoomorphic mask panel and the représentation of a unique anthropomorphic figure of great iconographie importance are published here. Fig. 1) The Jaguar Stairway in Structure Sub-73, Group 6C-XVI, Tikal. (Photo: K. H. Mayer, February 19S7, by permission of IDAEH) The mask panel (Fig. 1) represents a stylized feline, possibly the face of a jaguar; it was carved in limestone and was once covered with red-painted plaster. The image is sculptured in high relief and is located in Structure Sub-73; 27</page><page sequence="3">28 it flanks one side of a low staircase leading to a platform; it is 85 cm high and 370 cm wide. The zoomorphic figure features a pronounced upper lip and nose, has a wide, open mouth and wears large earflare assemblages. The whole configuration is enframed by a 15 cm wide border. i r Fig. 2) The "Lord of the Mirrors" in Structure Sub-75, Group 6C XVI, Tikal. (Photo: K. H. Mayer, February 1987, by permission ofIDAEH) The anthropomorphic figure (Fig. 2) is located in the southern part of Structure Sub-75, is 150 cm high and is enframed on three sides by a 23 cm wide rectangular border. The low-relief sculpture is executed in limestone and covered with red-painted stucco. The top border, the face of the seated figure, and portions from the lower left-hand section of the image are destroyed. The figure is in a dynamic style and the head, decorated with circular earflares, was originally repre sented frontally. The personage is surrounded by a chain of round elements which contain incised crescent-forms or circlets. According to information provided by Laporte, the personage may be a deity and is known as the "Lord of the Mirrors", because under his right arm and on one leg is a distinct glyph-like symbol, T-617a, presently interpreted and read as "mirror". Laporte furthermore suggests that the round elements encircling the figure may represent eut and complete conch shells, which J. Eric S. Thompson associated with the concept of water, the Lord of the Night, and the direction South. The "Mascarones" Group at Tikal has been covered provisionally with a thatched roof and is not open to the public. Archaeological Atlas: Yucatan and Campeche MERIDA (A. Barrera Rubio/mex). As an integral part of the National Archaeological Atlas of Mexico Project, the office of Registro Público de Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicas of INAH has begun to register the archaeological sites in each of the federal states of Mexico. The Atlas Project, which is long-term, is to create a data bank for each state and set the basis for a policy of conservation of Prehispanic sites. In 1985, work began in Yucatan to complément the already published Atlas Arqueológico de Yucatán (Garza Tarazona, Silvia y Edward B. Kurjack, 2 vols., México, D. F. 1980). After three field seasons (1985-1987), Adriana Velázquez Morlet and Edmundo López de la Rosa have registered 505 archaeological sites; together with the 1,117 sites compiled in the Atlas of 1980 and another 49 sites documented by bib liographical research between 1980 and 1985, the site inven tory for Yucatan now encompasses 1,671 sites. Although this is an increase of 49.6% over the information known up tili 1980, this number is not the last word since the registering of archaeological sites is still going on. In Campeche activities for the Atlas Arqueológico de Campeche also took place between 1985 and 1987, and were coordinated by Renée Lorelei Zapata Peraza of the local Centro Regional of INAH. Although only two short field seasons could be carried out, the total number of Prehispanic Settlements filed in Campeche rose to more than 800. The register is based on the interprétation of aerial photographs of about three-quarters of the State territory (verified on maps with the scale 1:50,000), of which owing to a shortage of funds only about 25% could be verified in the field. The register in Campeche is accompanied by a photo archive and a bibliographical apparatus. The complete files to the Atlas Arqueológico contain the three-dimensional location of the ^ site and information on means of access, earlier reports, architecture, sculpture, inscriptions, water supply, exploita tion of raw materials, types of looting, etc. SAMS: Swedish Society of Americanists STOCKHOLM (SAMS). The Swedish Society of America nists (SAMS) was founded in December 1986 and has mul tidisciplinary character with reference to both the Americas.
