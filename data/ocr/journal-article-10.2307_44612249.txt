Farmer Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Adrian K. Lund Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ABSTRACT Lower extremity injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes are both frequent and associated with considerable long-term impairment. Deformation of a vehicle's occupant compartment resulting in intrusion into the foot area is often cited as a source of many of these injuries. Similarly, collisions involving only a portion of a vehicle's front structure are typically said to produce greater intrusion than fully engaged crashes. The relationship between occupant compartment intrusion and the risk of lower extremity injuries was examined through a series of offset frontal crash tests of 1984-89 Oldsmobile Cieras. Results from both car-to- car and car-to-barrier test crashes with instrumented dummies confirm that there is a relationship between occupant compartment deformation and the loads acting on the lower extremities of vehicle occupants, even when crash severity has been controlled. Several of the measured relationships mimic biomechanical mechanisms that have been hypothesized to explain lower leg injury in real-world crashes. The results indicate that crash testing to assess the risk of lower leg injuries will need to focus on intrusion as well as injury measures from instrumented test dummies. INTRODUCTION Injuries to the lower extremities are a common consequence of motor vehicle crashes, especially frontal crashes. One study using 1977-78 National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) data found that, among severely injured body regions, legs were the second most frequently injured in automobile crashes [1]. Twenty- three percent of all injuries with em Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or 4 were lower extremity injuries. Only the chest was more frequently injured at this severity level. The same study showed that of all the occupants with an AIS &gt; 3 leg injuries, 71 percent had been involved in frontal crashes. A more recent study used data from the National Accident Sampling Survey (NASS) from 1988-90 to examine leg injuries suffered by restrained front seat occupants involved in frontal crashes [2]. Excluding crashes that resulted in rollovers, and counting only one injury per body region or aspect for occupants whose least severe injury was AIS &gt; 2, these authors reported that lower extremity injuries occurred about as often as head and chest injuries. The same study found a higher frequency of leg injuries among drivers than front seat passengers and suggested that female occupants may be at greater risk of certain types of lower extremity injuries (foot/ankle) than males. Another study of lower leg injuries based on trauma center admissions found that the higher frequency of foot/ankle injuries among women may be result of their generally shorter stature compared with men [3]. They found a 64 percent increase in lower extremity fractures among drivers who were shorter than average height (170 cm). Morgan et al. found that foot/ankle injuries were the most frequent type of lower extremity injury (33 percent) at the AIS &gt; 2 level in a study of 1979-86 NASS data [4]. A more recent study of restrained front seat occupants in frontal crashes found a similar distribution by anatomical region [2]. These authors reported that 30 percent of AIS &gt; 2 leg injuries were to the foot/ankle, 20 percent each for the shank and knee, and between 10 and 15 percent each for the thigh and pelvis. Lower extremity injuries are generally associated with significant long-term consequences. A study of trauma center patients with AIS &gt; 2 leg injury and no concomitant head or spinal injury found that only 56 866</page><page sequence="2">percent of those working before their injury returned to work within a year's time [5]. A review of outcomes for various lower extremity injuries by Levine indicated that many of these injuries result in a loss of range of motion, arthritic conditions, and pain that affect patients with these injuries for several years [6]. Non- comminuted, mid-shaft fractures of the long bones (femur, tibia, fibula) tended to have the best long-term prognoses, while injuries involving the joints and articular surfaces were more likely to result in impairments or pain that often prevented patients from returning to a normal pre-injury life style. The cost to society of these injuries is high, if difficult to measure. A 1989 study by the All-Industry Research Advisory Council (now the Insurance Research Council) found the average economic losses associated with the fracture of a weight-bearing bone were as high as $23,963, accounting for medical expenses, wage loss, replacement services expenses, and other costs [7]. A 1991 study of benefits paid for catastrophic* injuries in automobile crashes, showed that a fracture of a weight-bearing bone was the third most costly ($222,600), behind only brain injuries and paralysis [8]. Other estimates include Miller et al., who found that leg injuries at the AIS = 2 and AIS = 3 levels have higher medical costs than injuries to other regions when the injury is the most severe suffered by a patient [9]. Their estimates by maximum AIS (MAIS) of medical and rehabilitation costs alone, for leg injuries from motor vehicle crashes are as follows: $584 per case for MAIS = 1; $6,461 per case for MAIS = 2; $18,632 per case for MAIS = 3; and $26,668 per case for MAIS = 4. Lower extremity injuries are generally caused by contact with various components inside the vehicle. The most common direct contact injury source for pelvic injuries reported for frontal crashes in the 1988- 90 NASS was belt restraint system [2]. The authors attribute the low incidence of instrument panel as source to the idea that this would technically be an indirect contact injury source. Pelvis injuries resulting from impacts against the instrument panel would be caused by forces transmitted by the knee- femur load path. Huelke et al. found the side interior, steering assembly, and instrument panel to be the most frequent hip injury sources when all crash types were examined [1]. Femur injuries tend to be associated with contacts against the instrument panel, steering assembly, and side interior. Mid-shaft and distal fractures usually resulted from knee loading against the instrument *Catastrophic injuries are those with expected losses greater than $200,000. panel [2]. In frontal crashes, knee injuries usually resulted from impacts against instrument panel and structures below it. The authors did not find a high frequency of subluxation injuries caused by contact with the lower instrument panel. Transverse fractures of the tibia and fibula in frontal crashes were shown to result primarily from direct contact with the instrument panel. The indirect sources of loading that contributed to these injuries include floor and to a smaller extent the foot controls [2]. Nearly all foot/ankle injuries in the frontal crashes were attributed to contact with the floor and foot controls [2]. This observation agrees with the analysis of Morgan et al. who divided foot/ankle injuries into six categories representing different injury mechanisms [4]. Contact with the foot controls and floor accounted for 67 percent of all ankle injuries and 71 percent of all foot injuries. Both studies found that the largest portion of specified ankle injuries involved either the lateral or medial malleolus or both. Similar rates of malleolar involvement are reported by Lestina et al. and Otte et al. [10][1 1]. Intrusion is often cited as increasing the likelihood and seriousness of lower extremity injuries. For instance, Pattimore et al. showed that the level of intrusion associated with AIS &gt; 1 lower extremity injuries was significantly greater than the mean level associated with AIS = 1 injuries in a study of 263 injuries [12]. Otte et al. report that 74 percent of the foot/ankle fractures in their study of 141 crashes were associated with deformations of the foot area [11]. Similarly, four of the six ankle/foot mechanisms suggested by Morgan et al. imply intrusion or some form of foot well collapse [4]. While these mechanisms only accounted for 21 percent of both ankle and foot injuries, the more frequent mechanisms - contact with foot controls and contact with the floor - do not exclude intrusion as a causative factor. It is reasonable that, if deformation of the occupant compartment forces these structures toward the occupant's legs, the risk of injury would be greater. Unfortunately, distinguishing the contribution of intrusion from the effects of crash severity is not straightforward using field data because the crashes causing greater vehicle deformations are typically the more severe crashes [12]. The susceptibility of knee and femur to fracture from axial loading is well documented and incorporated in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 (49 CFR Part 571.208). This standard limits the load measured in the femur of instrumented test dummies to less than 10 kN. While the force tolerance of the knee-femur-pelvis complex is duration dependent, this value roughly corresponds to the tolerance 867</page><page sequence="3">associated with an instantaneously applied load that would likely produce fractures of the patella, femur, or pelvis [13]. Mertz has also presented this knee-femur- pelvis tolerance data scaled to represent the strength of both the large adult male and small adult female occupants [13]. Instantaneous loads indicative of knee, femur, or pelvis fractures are 6.2 kN for the small female and 11.5 kN for the large male. There is limited research on the injury tolerance for other parts of the lower extremity, but no general agreement exists regarding performance requirements. General Motors Corporation (GM) submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) suggestions for injury tolerance values possible with the Hybrid III test dummy, but the types of injuries represented do not include the more common injuries to the ankle/foot, particularly malleolus fractures [14]. Begeman et al. have examined foot/ankle injuries resulting from both forced dorsiflexion and forced inversion/eversion [1 5][1 6]. Although their experiments did not support injury tolerance descriptions based on load measurements that are possible with existing dummy designs, it is worth noting that both the axial forces measured in the tibia and the calculated moments about the axis of motion in injury-producing tests were considerably lower than those suggested by GM for injuries to the tibial shaft. Despite field observations linking intrusion with the risk of lower extremity injuries, Pattimore et al. commented on the problems of separating the effects of crash severity and intrusion using the field data, and they suggested test crashes with instrumented dummies to better examine these relationships [12]. Results from five test crashes reported by Krueger et al. indicated that reductions of foot well volume caused by compartment deformation were well correlated to the loads measured at the dummy's foot with an accelerometer [17]. This paper reports on lower extremity injury measures from an extensive series of offset frontal crashes conducted at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Vehicle Research Center [18]. These tests provided an opportunity to further examine the relationship between compartment deformations and leg injury risks. The offset configuration of these tests made them especially appropriate for studying this relationship, because such tests have been shown to result in more compartment deformation than full- overlap barrier tests required by government safety standards [19] [20]. METHOD TEST MATRIX - Five frontal crashes between two 1984-89 model year Oldsmobile Cutlass Cieras at a closing speed of 1 12 km/h and 50 percent overlap were conducted. Additional Cieras were also crashed together at a closing speed of 128 km/h and into various barriers with varying overlap (30 to 50 percent) and speeds ranging from 56 to 64 km/h. The four barrier types tested included a rigid barrier, a 380 mm deep aluminum honeycomb barrier with a crush strength of 310-345 kPa (single stage), a 460 mm deep barrier of the same honeycomb with bumper element made of 1 .7 MPa crush strength honeycomb (single stage with bumper), and a two-stage barrier consisting of 250 mm of 1.7 MPa honeycomb behind 460 mm of the 310-345 kPa strength material. The complete test matrix is shown in Table 1.

Before testing, each was checked for evidence of prior crash history or unusual corrosion. Some vehicles exhibited evidence of body panel repairs, but all were judged to be structurally sound. Preparation for the crash included removal of the rear seat and trunk accessories to provide room for mounting an on-board emergency brake system and data acquisition power supply. The gasoline and other engine fluids were drained. The fuel tank was refilled to capacity with a less volatile solvent of similar specific gravity. The test weight of the vehicles ranged between 1,334 and 1,431 kg with an average of 1,376 kg. Differences in test weights were due to differences in drive train and accessory options. A Hybrid III 50th percentile adult male dummy was placed in the driver's seat of each test car and the seat belt was fastened. The otherwise standard dummies were fitted with instrumented lower legs and an on- board data acquisition system. The Intelligent Dummy Data Acquisition System (IDDAS) resides in a modified spine box of the Hybrid III adult male. All dummy certification tests were conducted with the modified dummy to demonstrate that the modifications did not alter the performance of the dummy. The driver's seat and the dummy's test position were set according to the procedures specified for NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program [21]. DUMMY MEASUREMENTS - The dummy measurements recorded in these tests included the head, chest, and femur measurements specified in FMVSS 208. In addition, the compression of the dummy's ribs and several lower leg measures were recorded. The lower leg measures included the anterior-posterior (A-P) and lateral-medial (L-M) bending moments at the upper end of the tibia, the lower tibia axial load, and either the A-P moment and shear force or the L-M moment and shear force at the lower tibia. The lower tibia sensor used for these tests can be oriented to provide measures of A-P bending moments and shear forces or measures of L-M moment and shear forces. Each orientation was used in about half of the crash tests, although data are limited for the L-M orientation due to data losses. It should be noted also that the dorsiflexion range of the Hybrid III feet was increased from 30° to 45° in two of the 56 km/h car-to-car tests; it has been argued that 45° is more biofldelic [15]. Data are provided for all crash tests, but data from the latter tests were excluded from final correlations between intrusion and injury measures. All dummy measurements were recorded by the IDDAS at either 10,000 or 14,705 Hz. Each data channel included a prefilter to ensure digital fidelity. In addition to these electronic measurements, high-speed cinematography was used to record dummy kinematics and to verily vehicle overlap with the barrier at the instant of impact. INTRUSION MEASUREMENTS - The deformation of the occupant compartment was characterized by differences between precrash and postcrash measurements of the location of targets affixed to interior structures relative to a vehicle fixed reference system. Three points were used to characterize deformation of the toeboard. Two points on the lower instrument panel, opposite the knees, were recorded. The location of the brake pedal was also considered. DATA - Only the car-to-car and 40 percent overlap barrier tests were used for the analyses presented in this paper; thus 22 vehicles in 16 crashes were considered. The repeated tests in this subset permitted some analysis of the influence of impact speed and barrier configuration. The influence of overlap could not be reliably examined with the current data set. The relationship between intrusion and injury measures was measured by Pearson correlation coefficients. In order to assess the unique contribution of intrusion, partial correlations between intrusion and injury measures were also examined after controlling for crash severity. In this analysis, crash severity was represented in terms of the subject vehicle's kinetic energy (one-half the total kinetic energy for two-vehicle crashes) less any energy absorbed by the deformable barriers. Energy absorbed by the barrier was calculated by measuring the deformed volume of the barrier and calculating the energy required to produce this deformation from the known stiffness of the barrier. RESULTS FMVSS 208 INJURY MEASURES - The FMVSS 208 injury measures recorded in these tests are summarized in Table 2. The HIC threshold of 1000, which indicates a significant risk of severe head injury, was exceeded in only two tests. It was exceeded in a 40 percent overlap 64 km/h crash into the single-stage barrier producing a HIC of 1090 and in one of two cars involved in the 50 percent overlap 64 km/h car-to-car test producing a HIC of 1240. In both cases a review of the high-speed films made during the crash revealed that the dummy's head struck the hub and/or rigid spoke of the steering wheel as the intruding column 869</page><page sequence="5">Table 2 Summary of FMVSS 208 Injury Measures Measure Minimum Maximum Mean Head Injury Criterion (HIC) 495 1240 688 Chest Accel, (g) (3 ms Clip) 32 68 45 Chest Deflection (mm) 33 58 43 Right Femur (kN) 2.1 9.5 5.8 Left Femur (kN) 0.7 6.1 2.3 pivoted upward. All of the other head, chest, and femur measurements were below the FMVSS 208 limits, although right femur loads approached the 10 kN limit in the same car that produced the HIC of 1240. (Mertz has proposed that instantaneous axial loads in excess of 9 kN are sufficient to fracture the femur [13].) In addition, chest deflections were at least 50 mm for one dummy in four of the tests: 64 km/h car-to-car test (51 mm), 56 km/h car-to-car test (51 mm), 64 km/h car into single stage deformable barrier test (58 mm), 56 km/h car into rigid barrier test (50 mm). (Mertz suggested 50 mm as an appropriate limit for belted occupants [13]). INTRUSION - Although occupant compartment deformation varied considerably, all tests resulted in some intrusion. The lower instrument panel was moved rearward toward the occupant with a modest amount of rotation in the vehicle's XY plane. Movements from the left side ranged between 4 and 30 cm with an average of 14 cm (Appendix A-l). The right side of the lower instrument panel was moved between 5 and 25 cm with the average rearward movement being 11 cm. Except in four tests, the left side displacement was always greater. Differences between the right and left side measures indicate that as the instrument panel moved rearward, it rotated a maximum of 9° counterclockwise pushing the left side closer to the occupant. The lateral and vertical displacements of the lower instrument panel, in general, were small (Appendixes A-2 and A-3). Both right and left targets were moved less than 1 cm to the left on average. The average vertical displacements for the right and left lower instrument panel were 3 and 2 cm, respectively. There were no large differences among the mean measurements from the toepan (Table 3). An examination of the differences between longitudinal measures from any single test (Appendix A-l) confirms that the typical pattern of toeboard deformation is represented by the mean values shown in Table 3. The right and left targets were located at more rigid junctions with the center tunnel and wheel arch, respectively, which may explain the typically larger displacements at the center. Large left and right deformations were observed in some more severely deformed cars in which buckling of the sill and tunnel exaggerated deformation at the edges of the toeboard.

Over all crashes, there was considerably more variability in measurements from the left side of the toeboard suggesting that the interaction between the road wheel and wheel arch may not be highly repeatable, at least for the tested car models. The lateral displacement of the toeboard targets was relatively small, averaging 1 cm. The vertical displacements of the toeboard were also small (just over 1 cm) for the right and left sides, but the average vertical displacement of the center target was about 5 cm. The brake pedal appeared to be displaced with the toeboard. The average longitudinal displacement of 20 cm was very similar to that observed for the right toepan target, and the two measures were strongly correlated (Pearson r = 0.85). Both measures also exhibited significant correlations with the longitudinal measures of the other toeboard targets. The lateral displacements were relatively small and in either direction; the brake pedal moved toward the ground in all tests with a mean displacement of 5 cm. The test series did not include crashes with all barriers at all speeds, so that it is not possible to fully estimate the effects of these variables on intrusion. However, results were consistent with the test speeds and energy absorption characteristics of the barriers. Table 4, for example, shows that the mean longitudinal intrusion measures for the 56 km/h car-to-car crash tests were less than for the 64 km/h car-to-car tests. Appendix A-l shows similar effects of speed for those barriers tested at different speeds. Data in Appendix A- 1 also illustrate that, at 64 km/h for example, longitudinal intrusion was greatest for the car-to-car test, somewhat less for the deformable single stage barrier, which absorbed part of the crash energy, and least for the two-stage barrier, which absorbed even more crash energy. Lateral and vertical components of intrusion were not consistently related to test speed or barrier configuration. Correlation coefficients relating the barrier-adjusted kinetic energy of the crash to the various intrusion measures generally confirmed a strong, positive relationship, while lateral and vertical intrusion measures were typically uncorrected with crash energy (Table 5).

However, axial loading of the femur and tibia, although occasionally high, did not frequently reach injury thresholds and only on the right leg [13]. (The results here consider only the instantaneous load; it should be remembered that some of the high axial loads seen in Appendixes B-l and B-2 would imply likelihood of injury if sustained for sufficient duration, which is an issue not examined in this paper.) Axial loads measured on the right femur ranged between 2.1 kN and 9.5 kN with the latter value just exceeding the threshold for tibia fracture; the mean axial load was 5.8 kN (Table 6). Axial loads measured on the left femur were substantially lower, ranging from 0.7 to 6.1 kN, with a mean of 2.3 kN. Similarly, axial loads measured on the right tibia ranged between 1.5 kN and 9.2 kN with a mean of 4.3 kN (Table 6). Although only a single tibia axial load (in a 56 km/h car-to-car test) exceeded the injury threshold of 9.0 kN for the midsize adult male, another four tests resulted in axial loads on the right tibia that exceeded the 5.1 kN injury threshold for the small female [13]. By comparison, none of the left tibia axial loads exceeded this lower threshold, ranging between 1 .4 kN and 4.9 kN with a mean of 2.2 kN. The tibia bending moments indicated greater injury likelihood than the axial loading data. In the 14 cars with injury data, eight of the dummies registered an upper or lower tibia bending moment exceeding the threshold of 225 Nm [13]. Another two had bending moments in excess of 200 Nm, very near the threshold for breaking the tibia. As shown in Table 6 the right upper tibia moments averaged 161 and 168 Nm for the L-M bending moment and A-P moment, respectively. The left upper tibia moments averaged less, 78 Nm for L-M bending and 125 Nm for A-P bending, but the injury threshold was exceeded on a total of two left legs as well as three right legs. The lower tibia A-P bending moments in the right leg averaged 191 Nm, while in the left leg the bending moments averaged 172 Nm. Right leg lower A-P moments exceeding human tibia strength were measured in two tests, while the left leg lower tibia moments exceeded the tolerance value once. One additional injury threshold exceedance was observed in one of the 56 km/h rigid barrier tests, where the L-M moment was 332 Nm. There is some evidence that the increased ankle dorsiflexion range in the last two car-to-car tests affected the lower tibia bending moments. Data from two dummies were lost, but on the two remaining dummies, three of four legs had much lower A-P moments than observed in the other 56 km/h car-to-car tests. Although the fourth leg had a very high moment, the lower tibia bending moments for the four legs with 45° dorsiflexion range averaged 144 Nm, while the lower tibia bending moments for the four legs with 30° range averaged 176 Nm. The lower bending moments with the modified Hybrid III ankle were especially noteworthy given that longitudinal intrusion was considerably greater than the average from all 56 km/h crashes in those tests.

Dummy injury measures were typically lower in the 56 km/h tests than in the 64 km/h tests, whether car-to-car or car-to-barrier, but the 60 km/h tests sometimes produced higher injury results for lower limbs than the 64 km/h tests of the same configuration (and sometimes less serious results than the 56 km/h tests; see Table 7 and Appendixes B1 and B2). The energy absorption characteristics of the barrier also had some inconsistent effects, but these again were found primarily in the 60 km/h tests. As there were relatively few 60 km/h tests and no repeated tests of the same configuration, these results should not be overinterpreted. The best conclusion is probably that 60 km/h tests are not sufficiently more severe than 56 km/h tests, nor sufficiently less severe than 64 km/h tests, to produce consistently higher or lower, respectively, dummy injury results. The results at 56 km/h and 64 km/h, however, indicate that the different test speeds and barriers are having predictable effects in terms of the amount of energy transmitted to occupants. In addition, the correlation coefficients between barrier- adjusted kinetic energy and injury measures were consistently positive (Table 8). CORRELATION OF INTRUSION AND LOWER- LEG INJURY MEASURES - Appendix С contains the correlation coefficients between intrusion and all leg injury measures except the L-M bending moments and shear forces at the lower tibia, for which there were insufficient data. Also excluded from the correlations are all data from the two 56 km/h car-to-car crashes that used a dummy with greater ankle dorsiflexion range of 45°. The correlations reveal a strong relationship between longitudinal intrusion and dummy injury measures. Although several correlations between lateral measures of intrusion and injury were significant, as were some correlations between vertical intrusion measures and injury, longitudinal intrusion had many more and stronger correlations than vertical or lateral intrusion. In addition, as noted earlier, the variation in lateral and vertical intrusion measures was much smaller from test to test than for longitudinal intrusion. Therefore, results presented here focus on the intrusions measured along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. This focus is not meant to imply that vertical and lateral movement of interior components is unimportant but only that the larger variation in longitudinal intrusion allowed for more meaningful assessment of the relationship between intrusion and the likelihood of leg injury, as measured on the instrumented dummy.

Correlations between intrusion and dummy injury measures were especially strong for the right leg. The femur axial load correlated at Pearson r = 0.50 or higher with every measure of longitudinal intrusion. Correlations between longitudinal intrusion and upper tibia bending moments for the right leg were only slightly smaller, still exceeding r = 0.50 in most instances. A-P shear forces on the lower tibia were also highly correlated with most measures of intrusion. Axial forces on the right tibia were strongly correlated with intrusion at the right lower instrument panel (in front of the right knee) and moderately with longitudinal displacement of the left and right toepan and brake pedal. Lower A-P tibia bending moments on the right leg had only small and nonsignificant correlations with intrusion, despite the appearance of several moments that exceeded accepted injury thresholds. For the left leg, both A-P and L-M upper tibia bending moments were very strongly related to intrusion; in many cases, r2, a measure of shared variation, exceeded 0.50, suggesting that longitudinal intrusion explained more than half of the variation in upper tibia bending moments for the left leg. In addition, the lower tibia A-P bending moment was moderately correlated with several measures of intrusion and significantly correlated with intrusion at the right and center toepan. Neither femur nor tibia axial forces on the left leg correlated even moderately with longitudinal intrusion, despite somewhat greater intrusion for the left side of the toepan and instrument panel. Only the vertical displacement of the center toepan area was strongly correlated (r = 0.75) with tibia axial loads of the left leg, and there were no strong correlations with femur axial loads. One concern noted by previous researchers is that it is difficult to distinguish the effects of intrusion from the effects of crash severity, because greater intrusion and more serious injury usually occur in more severe crashes. Similar concerns relate to the current data. Therefore, the intrusion/injury relationship was recalculated after controlling for the barrier-adjusted kinetic energy of each crash. As may be seen in Table 9, some of the correlation coefficients that were significant before the adjustment for kinetic energy were substantially reduced after the adjustment; for example, the relationships between right femur axial loads and several measures of intrusion were weaker after adjusting for the kinetic energy of the crash. However, many strong and statistically significant relationships remain even after adjustment for energy. For instance, upper tibia bending moments and lower tibia shear force measures for the right leg remain correlated with instrument panel intrusion measured on the right side. Likewise, left lower tibia bending moments remain significantly correlated with toeboard intrusion after adjustment for energy. Curiously, some relationships, like that between left upper tibia bending moments and toepan intrusion, exhibited significant negative correlations after adjusting for crash energy. Although there were fewer correlations with lateral and vertical intrusion measures before adjusting for crash energy, most of them remained significant after adjusting for crash energy. Vertical displacement of the center toepan, for example, was significantly related to right upper tibia bending moments and to tibia axial forces on both legs with stronger correlations than before adjustment. Thus, although the energy of the crash may account directly for some high loads through greater forces associated with deceleration, intrusion accounts for significant proportions of the variation in injury measures even after controlling for crash energy. 874</page><page sequence="10">о OD ЭВ О J- СЯ 30 »Г S.

Even so, when crash energy is controlled, many measures of intrusion remain significantly related to injury measures, confirming the important implications of intrusion for survival and injury in real world crashes. The patterns of the correlation between intrusion and injury in the Oldsmobile Cieras used in these tests appear to reflect general trends noted elsewhere. For example, longitudinal intrusion of the right lower instrument panel, in front of the right knee, was significantly related to upper tibia bending moments, tibia axial forces, and lower tibia A-P shear forces of the right leg. These same injury measures were also significantly correlated with the vertical displacement of the center toepan and several other measures of toepan deformation. These observations combined with a strong correlation between lower tibia shear forces and upper tibia AP-bending moments (0.85) are consistent with an injury mechanism hypothesized from field investigations of real crashes: Tibia and ankle fractures may be caused by excessive bending loads resulting from pocketing and/or entrapment of the knee in the instrument panel with subsequent deformation of toe and floor pans [22]. Two distinct relationships between lower tibia AP- bending moments and intrusion were observed for the right and left legs, respectively. The right lower AP- bending moments were not significantly correlated with toeboard intrusion, but the left lower moments exhibited significant correlations with the longitudinal displacement of the toeboard measured at the center and right sides even after adjusting for crash energy. Nevertheless and despite similar levels of intrusion across the toepan, lower tibia bending loads exceeding critical injury limits were measured more frequently on the right leg. The right lower tibia experience is likely influenced by the right foot's initial placement on the accelerator pedal as described by Pilkey et al. [23]. Severe AP-bending moments may be generated when the foot is dorsiflected against the rotation stop, if the foot slides off the pedal. The magnitude of bending loads generated in this way would likely be more influenced by the orientation and location of the foot's impact against the toeboard than by extent of intrusion. For example, in the first 56 km/h test against the rigid barrier, the right lower tibia AP-bending moment measured 332 Nm, despite longitudinal toeboard displacements that were at the average of all cars or lower. In contrast, the largest left lower tibia bending moment was measured in the 60 km/h single stage barrier test that produced average or greater toepan displacements at two of the three measured locations. The two next greatest left lower tibia moments were measured in the 64 km/h car-to-car test which produced the greatest toeboard intrusion of any test. These examples indicate that the relationship between intrusion and injury risk may also be largely dependent on the location of the foot. The left leg might have had a different experience had the left foot to be situated differently, rather than flat on the floor as the protocol requires. Likewise, were the right foot to be on the brake to simulate a braking maneuver, very different dummy measures might have occurred. For example, it might be that dorsiflexion as well as inversion/eversion injuries of the right ankle are more likely in crashes where the foot begins on the brake pedal. All of the current tests were conducted using the standard FMVSS 208 position, and the effect of initial leg position could not be examined here. A perplexing finding in these crashes was the generally low level of axial force on the left femur, despite greater intrusion of the left rather than right instrument panel. Although both right and left femur loads were similarly related to most intrusion measures after adjustment for crash energy, the left leg experienced much lower forces. Postcrash inspection of several tests found the dummy's left femur to be angled upward toward the dummy's torso with the tibial shaft against the instrument panel. In some cases the foot was barely in contact with the floor. The final positions suggest that the dummy's foot was raised up by the buckling floor or that initial contact of the upper tibia with the lower instrument panel sometimes caused the knee to slide upwards along the lower instrument panel. In either case, one would not necessarily expect the resulting loads on the left femur or tibia to be strongly related to the measures of longitudinal deformation. The only way to verify this hypothesis would be to observe the left leg's kinematics using high-speed, on- board cameras. Another surprising finding was the strong relationship between femur axial loads and brake pedal intrusion. As neither the right nor left dummy foot was placed on the brake pedal during these tests, it seems unlikely that brake pedal movement caused these loads directly. Direct loading of the knee by the instrument panel seems a more likely cause of femur axial loads and the original correlations indicated a relationship between right femur loads and lower instrument panel intrusion (Pearson r = 0.70 and 0.68 for left and right 876</page><page sequence="12">instrument panel, respectively). However, after adjusting for crash energy, these relationships were no longer significant. Any relationship between the adjusted femur loads and residual intrusion measures may have been obscured by damage to the instrument panel imparted by the dummy's knee. The brake pedal, which like the instrument panel is supported by a bracket attached to the fire wall, would be displaced without effects of damage caused by contact with the dummy. Hence, the relationship between femur loads and brake pedal displacements may reflect the general relationship between femur loads and intrusion. In fact, brake pedal, toepan, and lower instrument panel measures were highly intercorrelated (r &gt; 0.80). COMPARISON WITH REAL-WORLD CRASH DATA - In addition to the similarities of these test results with general observations from field studies, the test observations were compared with real-world crashes of the same model car. Forty frontal crashes involving mid-1980s Cieras were identified in the NASS database. The estimated velocity change (AV) for these crashes ranged between 19 and 70 km/h for the 28 crashes with known AV. By comparison, the AV estimated from crash damage for the test vehicles ranged between 40 and 55 km/h. Only nine of the NASS crashes resulted in lower extremity injuries for the drivers. Five of the injured drivers in the NASS data were restrained by seat belt and four were unrestrained. Table 10 summarizes the lower extremity injuries not involving system/organ codes other than integumentary for the five belt-restrained drivers. Four of the five drivers had injuries described as ankle/foot fractures. In addition, one driver suffered a femur fracture. The driver of the vehicle involved in the most severe crash suffered only an ankle sprain despite significant intrusion in the foot area. This fortunate outcome may have been influenced by the driver's young age, 19 years. One very striking observation about the data presented in Table 10 is that even in this small sample, four of the five belt-restrained drivers with foot ankle fractures are females with relatively short stature. Also the only driver without bone fractures is a relatively young adult male with only slightly smaller than average build. Although studies mentioned earlier suggested a higher risk of lower extremity injuries for women compared with men, it is indeed surprising that this limited sample of NASS data provided such a vivid illustration. Furthermore, the lower tibia load data measured in this crash series also hints at this observation. Only 4 of 48 lower tibia measures (Y- moment and axial force) exceed the injury tolerance values based on tibia strength for the 50th percentile male dummy. The same data set include 19 obser- Table 10 Summary of Restrained Drivers with Lower Extremity Injuries from Frontal Crashes of Qldsmobile Ciera, 1988-1992 NASS Intrusion Range (cm) for Driver Lower Extremity Injuries Components below AV (km/h) Gender Age Weight (kg) Stature (cm) (not including Integumentary) Steering Column 70 Male 19 70 180 Right Ankle Sprain (AIS 1) 10-41 62 Female 36 50 170 Right Ankle Fracture 0 -15 AIS 3); Right Femur Fracture (AIS 3); Right Calcaneus Fracture (AIS 2) 41 Female 71 50 160 Left Ankle Fracture AIS 2) 15 Unknown Female 51 52 170 Left Foot Fracture - 0-8 4th Metatarsal (AIS 2) 31 Female 39 56 157 Right Ankle/Foot 0 Fracture (AIS 2) 877</page><page sequence="13">vations that exceed the moment and axial force tolerances (115 Nm and 5,100 N, respectively) for the small female. Although the 50th percentile male dummy can not give accurate indications of the loads experienced by persons with smaller stature, it is possible that the effect on leg loads of the small female's lower mass might be offset by a more forward seating position. The foregoing observation suggest the need for similar tests with the small female dummy sitting in a representative driving posture. CONCLUSIONS Significant correlations between dummy load measurements and measures of occupant compartment deformation indicate that intrusion plays a role in causing lower extremity injuries. Deformation characterized by interior structures moving toward the occupant increase the force of interaction between the two. While this result suggests that eliminating intrusion would lead to a reduction of injuries, the data reported here also indicate that other factors influence occupant loads and hence, injury risk. The Hybrid III dummy's instrumented legs proved useful in studying relationship between intrusion and injury risk. However, additional testing and analysis are needed to prioritized crashworthiness design objectives. There is an important need for future crashworthiness designs to pay more attention to the investigation of lower leg, foot, and ankle injuries. The results presented here indicate that crash testing to assess this injury risk will need to focus on intrusion as well as injury measures taken from instrumented test dummies. REFERENCES 1.
