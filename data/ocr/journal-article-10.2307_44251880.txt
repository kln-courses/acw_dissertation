<plain_text><page sequence="1">i Landscape, religion, and KNOWLEDGE IN EIGHTEENTH- CENTURY England Robert J. Mayhew Students need to of situate landscape their work and of in environmental the context of ideas social have and long intellectual recognized history. the need to situate their work in the context of social and intellectual history. Recently they have shifted attention from socioeconomic contexts to focus on more specific personal and group contexts relevant to the production of land- scape imagery and discussions.1 The flowering in historical studies of 'revision- ism', or the questioning of interpretive and methodological historical commonplaces, suggests that further reassessment of the contexts in which his- torians of landscape ideas and environmental historians embed their narratives is in order. In this article I aim to show the potential of revisionism to illuminate land- scape ideas that have hitherto been underplayed, by looking at the language of debate in eighteenth-century discussions of landscape, following the method of the 'Cambridge school'.2 Valuable work has been done in recent years on atti- tudes to landscape and nature in the eighteenth century, seeking to examine the political and socioeconomic contexts of landscape imagery3 and subse- quently the gendered nature of landscape debates.4 This work exposing the ide- ologies of nature discourse 'from below' can be complemented by an examination of the self-understanding of the ruling orders of the period, which reveals different patterns of intention. I look, specifically, to the religious groundings of English landscape debates in the 'long' eighteenth century (c. 1689-£.l 832). I will then suggest that this alters our understanding of the field of knowledge in which landscape and the natural world participated in ways which tie it closely to the revisionism of Jonathan Clark's interpretation of England at that time as an anden régime? A denominational discourse The importance of religion in eighteenth-century England is one of the 'redis- coveries' of revisionist historians who have sought to counter the traditional his- Ecumene 1996 3 (4) © Arnold 1996</page><page sequence="2">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteenth^century England 455 tonography of a secularizing Enlightenment. This has been complemented by analysis of the manner in which denominational positions influenced both polit- ical language and practice.6 That Christianity was, and remained, of vital impor- tance to those in the eighteenth century who viewed the landscape and to those who sought to justify the worth of such an activity is something that, whilst per- haps underplayed recently, has never been denied. But it has not been recog- nized that elements of a denominational discourse, in which arguments were based on varying interpretations of the Christian message and how to reach an understanding of that message, can be found in the debates over landscape and nature. As the present concern is with the ruling orders, I will focus on the eigh- teenth-century Anglican connection of landscape and religion. Colin Haydon has asserted the importance of anti-Catholicism in the eigh- teenth century,7 and a good example of this can be found in Thomas Burnet's Sacred theory of the earth , which bound denominational discourse and natural evi- dence to create its argument. In Book in, 4 On the conflagration', Burnet sought to discover where the purifying fire would begin, arguing: if we can find some Part of the Earth, or of the Christian World, that hath more of these natural Dispositions to Inflammation than the rest; and is also represented by Scripture as a more peculiar Object of God's Judgments at the coming of our Saviour, we may justly pitch upon that Part of the World, as first to be destroyed. Nature and Providence conspiring to make that the first Sacrifice to this fiery Vengeance. He found such a combination in 'the Roman Territory, or the Country of Italy' which is well known to natural philosophers as 'a Store-house of Fire', and, as obviously to Burnet (whose orthodoxy but not his anti-Catholicism is open to doubt), 'seeing [that] "Mystical Babylon", the seat of Antichrist, is the same Rome and its Territory' his conclusion was that 'there is a Fairness, on both hands [the natural and the providential], to conclude, that, at the glorious Appearance of our Saviour, the Conflagration will begin at the City of Rome'.8 For Burnet, the landscape of the Campagna demonstrated the processes that had moulded it, and demonstrated also that these processes linked its geogra- phy to a specific prophecy in the biblical chronology. Burnet's theory was not taken seriously by the scientific community for long, but his vision remained powerful. Robert Gray could still argue in 1794 that 'the volcanic nature of the country about Rome tends to confirm the opinion of those who, from the lan- guage of St John recollect that Rome, like Sodom, shall "be utterly burnt with fire" '.9 As Catholicism was attacked for its supposed rejection of reason in favour of tyrannical authority, so the same complaint was made against 'enthusiastic' Protestantism. Baker accused those who would 'lay aside all humane Learning' of a 'wild Anabaptistical conceit ...' 10 By the late eighteenth century, this 'anabaptistical conceit' was associated by many Anglicans with the Methodists, who were ridiculed in the sphere of landscape appreciation by Richard Graves in his novel The Spińtual Quixote . The La Manchan in this case was Geoffrey Wildgoose, a Methodist, who visited William Shenstone's famous garden, The Leasowes. Wildgoose responded violently, knocking down Shenstone's 'idols' (i.e. his garden statuary), and writing: 'we ought to spiritualize our ideas as much Ecumene 1996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="3">456 Robert J. Mayhew as possible; and it is worth while to enquire, how far too violent a fondness for these merely inanimate beauties might interfere with our love of God, and attach us too strongly to the things of this world.' Shenstone's response is that of the orthodox Anglican, who 'could not forbear laughing at his old friend's frantic proceedings'.11 Graves's satire contained a grain of truth about the Methodist response to gardens: John Wesley, in a visit to Stourhead in Wiltshire, expressed his disgust at the 'images of devils [i.e. classical gods]', and defied 'all mankind to reconcile statues with nudities to common sense or common decency'.12 Anglicanism always portrayed itself as a via media between enthusiasm and rationalism. As such, it also sought to avoid an exclusive reliance on reasoning, stigmatized as 'natural religion' which ignored the Christian dispensation. The term 'nature' therefore was a highly sensitive one in Anglican religious dis- course. The (mainly) orthodox Samuel Clarke warned that Men . . . who in Christian countries, where the Gospel is preached, pretend to believe in the God of Nature , and yet at the same time reject the revelation of the Gospel , which is so agreeable to and perfective of the Law of Nature; do, generally speaking, in pretense only, and not in reality, show any more regard to natural than to revealed Religion, falling for the most part into absolute Atheism.13 As Clarke's words suggest, any deification of Nature was sedulously to be avoided and attacked, as in Samuel Johnson's mocking of the 'philosopher of nature' in chapter 22 of Rasselas (1759). In the fourth edition of his Dictionary (1773), Johnson added a long entry under 'nature' (epitomized from Boyle's Free inquiry into the vulgarly received notion of nature) , arguing: Nature sometimes means the Author of Nature, or natura naturans, as, nature hath made man partly corporeal and partly immaterial. For nature in this sense may be used the word creator . . . Nature is sometimes indeed commonly taken for a kind of semideity. In this sense it is best not to use it at all. Within the Anglican structure of argument, the two errors of rationalism and enthusiasm were in fact linked: 'after Men have try'd the force of naturell Reason in matters of Religion, they will soon be sensible of its weakness, and after they have run themselves out of breath and can centre no where they think they can find it . . . they will take up with an Infallible Guide [i.e. Rome].'14 Anglicanism was portrayed as threatened on both sides, and interpretation of the natural evi- dence provided by landscape for the proof of God by design arguments had to be closely regulated, reason avoiding hubris and revelation eschewing dogma- tism. Of course Anglicanism had internal disagreements, but all Anglicans tended to deploy the same structure of argument, because it was rhetorically effective to claim the middle ground between rationalism and enthusiasm. The disagreement emerged over where the middle ground Anglicanism claimed actu- ally lay, and arguments over this were relevant to ¿níradenominational arguments over how to view the landscape. On the one hand, many saw Samuel Johnson's High Churchmanship as sympathy with Rome. Thus he was accused of ignoring trees in his Journey to the western islands of Scotland (1775), where 'he would have made a shift to visit Popish church, or even the ruins of one',15 the clear sug- gestion being that his appreciation of the landscape was distorted by supersti- Ecumene 1 996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="4">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteenth'Century England 457 tion. On the other hand, many were equally suspicious of Samuel Clarke's proof of God from nature for leaning too far towards rationalism: William Whiston claimed that a 'Weed contained better Arguments for the Being and Attributes of God than all his Metaphysicks'.16 Clarke has been cited above giving an 'ortho- dox' Anglican view, whilst here he is seen as diverging from the via media by employing a rationalistic rather than a commonsense philosophy of proof by design. This clearly demonstrates that the adoption of different positions within Anglicanism led to different (and even diametrically opposed) judgements of an author's orthodoxy on the subject of what landscape and nature could prove about God's being and qualities, and how it showed this. High Churchmanship and landscape: an example I now offer some details of one Anglican view of natural philosophy and the landscape, to show how theological issues could feed into a way of seeing the environment. The High Church Anglicans of the mid-eighteenth century were among those who saw Samuel Clarke as too rationalistic in his theology, his Newtonian edification of reason leading him into the Arian heresy over the doc- trine of the Trinity. Indeed, John Hutchinson, whose natural philosophy influ- enced High Churchmen throughout the eighteenth century, had gone so far as to see Clarke, together with Newton and the geologist John Woodward, as a cabed attempting by the study of nature to destroy true Christianity. Hutchinson's violent response to this perceived threat and his understanding of the key word in the heretics' armoury was captured in a rhetorical question: 'may not a Man who pretends to be a Naturalist , talk so unnaturally, that another may take him for a Natural?' The reason for Hutchinson's attack was that in his view Newtonianism was attempting to understand by human reason the operations of nature in order to comprehend God, whereas 'nothing can be known of that Essence . . . but by Revelation'.17 This emphasis on revelation at the expense of reason, coupled with a reverence for liturgical and ecclesiastical traditions, dis- tinguished the High Church theology.18 This theology did not just lead into dis- tinctive positions on natural philosophy, as with Hutchinson, but into characteristic ways of seeing the landscape, as can be seen from Johnson's Journey to the western islands (1775) and William Jones's Observations in a journey to Pańs (1777). Where Clarke and Newton reasoned to God from the operation of nature, Johnson in his travel account consistently avoided the design argument. While he firmly believed in explanation by the laws of nature, this did not lead him to hold up such laws as elucidating God's essence. Johnson's dislike of the design argument was noted by his close friend Mrs Thrale: 'Rousseau is not like Johnson when he thinks a mute &amp; sublime Admiration of his works the best Worship of the Creator, altho' that Admiration should excite no Act of any sort, but end wholly in itself - Johnson thought that God Almighty sent us here to do some- thing - not merely to stare about .'19 This was noticeable in Johnson's frequent visits in later life to the Peak District in Derbyshire. Those who saw mountains as ugly deployed the design argument to suggest God had compensated for this Ecumene 1996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="5">458 Robert J. Mayhew by the metals and minerals found there.20 By the end of the century, changing tastes meant that most regarded the Peak as a sublime glory, and the awe the mountains inspired as an intimation of God.21 Johnson, by contrast, never con- nected the sights of the Peak to a proof of God in any way. The High Church's distinctive stress on revelation led Johnson to view theology as a system of propo- sitions, the contents and merits of which could not be gleaned from the appear- ance of the landscape, and this led to a characteristic absence from Johnson's travel writings of naturalistic proofs of God and related reflections. As we have already seen, the Presbyterian minister Donald McNichol saw Johnson as tainted by a 'Popish* fascination with the visible fabric of the church in his travel narrative. Johnson did indeed frequently comment on churches, but McNichol could have made this point a fortiori of the High Churchman William Jones, who was a follower of Hutchinson. Jones's Observations , an account of his trip to France, is studded with descriptions of church interiors as at St Omer: 'their internal magnificence, variety of ornament, the perfect clean- liness of the place from the roof to the floor, and the brightness of the furni- ture, is such as a protestant in England can have no idea of.'22 The bulk of such descriptions clearly suggest that Jones was far more interested in the subject of ecclesiastical ornament and ceremony than most other travellers. More impor- tantly, he was also far more complimentary about church decoration, reflecting his Anglo-Catholic sympathies, than were those from more Protestant back- grounds. This can be seen by comparing Jones with the admittedly splenetic Tobias Smollett, for whom 'their [the French people's] religion affords a per- petual comedy. Their high masses, their feasts, their processions, their pilgrim- ages, confessions, images, tapers, robes, incense, benedictions, spectacles, representations, and innumerable ceremonies . . . furnish a variety of enter- tainment from one end of the year to the other.'23 Although 'of English writers . . . few, if any, are so consistently pagan'24 as Smollett, his words here perhaps reflect his Presbyterian upbringing; they could easily have been uttered by Johnson's critic, McNichol. Certainly many other travellers to Roman Catholic countries, of all shades of Protestantism, made similar comments, which are poles apart from William Jones's views. Jones, in the Preface to his Observations , had argued that 'the attention of dif- ferent persons frequently falls upon different objects in the same place; and we see even the same things with different eyes, according to our several interests and dispositions.'25 It is now apparent that the High Church interests and dis- positions of Johnson and Jones led them to see different things in the land- scape, and to evaluate them differently from other travellers. In the joint concern for the fabric of the visible church and the diminution of the role of the proof of God from nature vis-à-vis other routes to faith, both of which were reflected in the characteristic presences and absences in their discussions of actual landscapes, both Johnson and Jones demonstrated a specifically High Church approach to the landscape. Ecumene 1 996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="6">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteenth'Century England 459 Landscape in the field of knowledge of eighteenth' century England Given the connection of landscape to Christian discourse and its denominational and intradenominational filiations, the question arises of how to reintegrate this with the findings of those who have focused upon the socioeconomic and polit- ical significance of landscape in the eighteenth century.26 Are the politics and the religion of landscape to be seen as separate, or as parts of the same dis- cursive framework, reflecting a coherent mentality in eighteenth-century England? The long eighteenth century, I suggest, witnessed the development of a hier- archy of values in which debate was framed and which determined the status of landscape and nature appreciation. This can be called an ancien régime mental- ity because its structuring and operation fit closely with the mental geography of the eighteenth century, which involved stress on the correspondence between hierarchy in the divine sphere and the hierarchy of creation, including human government, and in the other direction an anthropomorphic analogy between a man's natural body and the body politic . . . The argument from correspondence thus showed the naturalness of unified author- ity at the same time as it justified it morally. Order within the creation was the result of a just harmony of ranks and a due arrangement of them.27 The correspondence of natural, human, and divine hierarchies allowed not only the naturalization of the human and the divine but, moving in the opposite direction, the infusion of societal and religious debates into discussions of nature and landscape, which acted to elevate the status of the lower fields of knowl- edge such as the study of nature and the appreciation of landscape. The intel- lectual hierarchy of value, when turned to the natural world, placed the knowledge it yielded of the divine at the highest level, followed by insights for man as a moral actor, and finally the concern for nature, landscape, animals, and vegetables in their own right. Perhaps the clearest expression of the three levels of the hierarchy and their connection is found in Cockin's Ode to the genius of the lakes in the north of England: Objects three the duly wise With rap tur' d eye explore Things material, Moral ties, And Revelation's lore. As each unfolds a world complete, Where all that's fit and comely meet, So each, through binded laws And kindred charms, new light bestows.28 Taste seemed 'to comprise three orders or degrees in its universal comprehen- sion': first 'those objects which immediately relate to the divinity'; secondly taste and moral virtue 'in the social sphere' where 'sentiment must be intimately related to moral excellence'; and finally items of 'general ornament and hon- our'.29 Ecumene 1996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="7">460 Robert J. Mayhew Two sources show how the themes of religion and morality were believed to elevate the status of landscape discussions. Firstly, the prefaces to topographical poetry, gardening manuals, and picturesque guides. Topographical poets sought to 'ingraft' 'upon the natural stock of rural description some miscellaneous and exotic shoots' of reflection.30 Jago claimed to make his poem Edge Hill 'as exten- sively interesting as he [the poet] could, by the frequent Introduction of gen- eral Sentiments and moral Reflections'. 31 Gardening treatises and picturesque travel were also justified in moral terms, this often taking a negative form: even if they were not positively conducive to virtue, at least they did not encourage vice, thereby amounting to innocent pleasures. At the beginning of the century, the clergy were encouraged to garden 'not to make them envy' d by Magnificence, but to make them happy, by loving an innocent Diversion'.32 At the other end of the period, theorists of the Picturesque attempted a similar form of justification, Uvedale Price saying 'I have been desirous of opening new sources of innocent, and easily attained pleasures',33 and William Gilpin that 'we dare not promise him [the reader] more from picturesque travel, than a ratio- nal, and agreeable amusement. Yet even this may be of some use in an age teem- ing with licentious pleasure; and may in this light at least be considered as having a moral tendency.'34 Prefatory material is an important source for our under- standing of a society's scales of value,35 and the prefaces to many discussions of landscape and nature across the century emphasized the morals they inculcated, or at least indicated that they did not hinder moral and religious life. As well, then, as reading the landscape for 'elevating' moral and religious messages (as in the argument from design) , the activity of writing about landscape issues was justified with respect to the same scale of values. The second source of evidence for this hierarchy is the critical acclaim topo- graphical poets received for the introduction of more elevated themes. Joseph Warton wrote of Sir John Denham: it is one of the greatest and most pleasing arts of descriptive poetry, to introduce moral sentences and instructions in an oblique and indirect manner, in places where one naturally expects only painting and amusement ... [I]t is this particular art that is the very distinguishing excellence of Cooper's Hill; throughout which, the descrip- tions of places and images raised by the poet, are still tending to some hint or lead- ing into some reflection, upon moral life, or political instruction; much in the same manner as the real sight of such scenes or prospects is apt to give the mind a com- posed turn, and to incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object.36 Similarly The seasons were: to Thompson's mem'ry ever dear (Who seeing the seasons of the circling year, But not a mere description to rehearse, He crown'd each pregnant scene with moral verse)37 As Warton 's comments suggest, in the interpenetrative hierarchy of values, the linkage of moral reflections to natural scenes was not seen as a mere juxtapo- sition, but as the discussion of inseparable strands of thought, naturally occur- Ecumene 1 996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="8">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteenth^century England 461 ring in conjunction.38 This procedure of dignifying landscape description was not uncontroversial. Working within the same hierarchy of values, many were sceptical about the ana- logical power of landscape and nature. Samuel Johnson was in no doubt as to the relative merits of landscape aesthetics and morality: 'Never heed such non- sense, a blade of grass is always a blade of grass, whether in one country or another: let us if we do talk, talk about something; men and women are my sub- jects of enquiry.'39 Even if nature could yield moral insights by analogy, for Johnson it was better to focus on morality and religion without the filter of the natural world. Johnson also had a different opinion of Thompson's Seasons, the 'florid and luxuriant' diction of which was 'too exuberant, and sometimes may be charged with filling the ear more than the mind'.40 The question sceptics such as Johnson posed was one Joshua Reynolds also asked (Discourse iv): 'whether landscape painting has a right to aspire so far as to reject what the painters call the Accidents of Nature'41 in favour of what the Augustan era viewed as the universal and transcendent subjects of morality and religion.42 The religion and politics of landscape Given this scale of values, the religious elements in landscape debates in eigh- teenth-century England become more comprehensible. Praise of the deity or the moral lessons of nature's instructive book cannot be dismissed as conven- tional phraseology with no conceptual foundation. Given a hierarchy which val- ued moral and religious above natural discourse, whilst also accepting that nature revealed these two higher levels, it is hardly surprising that those writing on landscape directly connected their discussions to Christianity. It is in this context that the politics of landscape in eighteenth-century England is best understood. The injection of political issues or general reflec- tions upon the nature of good governance connected landscape discourse to higher concerns about the wellbeing of man, both in social and individual virtue. Political discourse occupied a different position in eighteenth-century England's field of knowledge from that it occupies today. The debate over landscape was 'political' in eighteenth-century English self-understandings in the sense that it was 'for the honour or interest of the nation', not that it was partisan or facti- tious.43 As such, the political languages of the period deployed a highly gener- alized language relating national strength to personal moral character: the public ideologies widespread in the Anglophone world by the late eighteenth cen- tury warned against 'slavery', denounced 'tyranny', pointed out the ways in which men could be defrauded of their ancient liberties, recorded the threat posed by stand- ing armies, and lamented the enervating effects of vice and luxury.44 Politics, seen as a moral discourse, participated in the overarching hierarchy of values and was incorporated into the landscape debates of the eighteenth cen- tury in that manner and for that reason. Politics also participated in this hierarchy of values by its incorporation into the religious discourse of the English nexus of church and state: 'the great discovery which we constantly make and remake as historians is that English Ecumene 1996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="9">462 Robert J. Mayhew political debate is recurrently subordinate to English political theology.'45 This was not only true of those defending the church-state nexus, but also of those criticizing it. Thomas Paine continually referred to 'nature' as the divine source of political wisdom, conflating human nature and the natural world to connect politics, piety, and place. Thus he argued of the American War of Independence that 4 as America was the only spot in the political world, where the principles of universal reformation could begin, so also was it the best in the natural world. . . . The scene which that country presents to the eye of a spectator, has some- thing in it which generates and encourages great ideas. Nature appears to him in magnitude.'46 The Dissenting minister Richard Price had also connected America's natural fertility with the opportunity to establish a libertarian polity in his Observations on the importance of the Ameńcan Revolution (1785).47 The dis- cursive connections which have recently been uncovered between politics and landscape in eighteenth-century England are, then, a subset of a broader strat- egy connecting landscape to moral and religious issues, which itself was the prod- uct of a strongly hierarchical mentalité. The eighteenth-century politics of landscape was not a crude ideological use of the concept when seen through the scales of value of contemporaries. It has too often been assumed that to show the presence of patriotic and political issues in landscape discussions is to verify the Thompsonian view of the eighteenth century as developing class struggle (with or without class) , with the elites ner- vously developing all the ideological channels possible to allay their fears.48 What Langford has called 'the propertied mind' meant that Englishmen were not squeamish about the massive disparity of rich and poor'.49 Thus, when reviewed in context, it appears that the politicization of landscape was part of a hierar- chy of values distinguished by its stability and continuity, hierarchical social order, monarchy and religion formed an interlocking matrix of national iden- tity for British subjects',50 and the language of landscape participated in that matrix. The ideological resonances of the language of escape The connection of politics and theology also expands our understanding of the language of landscape in eighteenth-century England. Many modern writers have recognized the sociopolitical meanings of the language of landscape, with its demands to 'survey' and 'command', arguing that this shows landscape to be the embodiment of class-conscious projects of social control. This 'survey' of the land is the view of the outsider: 'the crucial phrase here is perhaps "commanding height", a phrase borrowed of course from the language of military tactics, and by no means used, by eighteenth-century poets, without a sense of embattled hostility to what is being commanded, the landscape below.'51 This class-based metaphor of landscape has also been understood as a gendered desire to order and control Nature, the 'coy or seductive maiden'.52 Yet this language was also one of religious topography. The sensitivity Johnson Ecumene 1 996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="10">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteenth^century England 463 displayed in defining the word 'nature' (see above), and his exclusion of the writings of Samuel Clarke from the Dictionary due to his heterodoxy,53 was part of a broader concern for the religious resonance of the language of natural description in eighteenth-century England which continued the patterns Hill described for the period up to 1660.54 This was displayed throughout society, and epitomized in the illustrative quotations Johnson used in his Dictionary (1755), which persistently connected landscape to religion by a metaphorical use of physical terminology in theological contexts.55 God was portrayed as on high, his view all-encompassing in space and time. Brown summarized the extent of God's spatial survey: 'He that laid the foun- dations of the earth cannot be excluded the secrecy of the mountains; nor can there any that escape the perspicacity of those eyes, which were before light, and in whose opticks there is no opacity.' God's prospect also extended through all the time he himself created: 'All futuńties are naked before that All-seeing Eye, the sight of which is no more hindered by distance of time than the sight of an angel can be determined by distance.'56 Wilkins summarized these two elements and the resultant prospect God has of the world and man: 'He hath a perfect Comprehension of all things, that have been, that are, or shall be . . . So that this Attribute of his must be infinite and unbounded, both extensive with respect to the several kinds of Objects which it comprehends; and likewise intensive, as it sees every single Object with a most perfect infallible view.'57 If this is God's view, the human prospect will be accordingly limited. 'Our understandings lie grovelling in this lower region, muffled up in mists and dark- ness.'58 Man's cloudy prospect in the present is due not only to his position in the chain of being, but also to his postlapsarian position in the Mosaic chronol- ogy. Man's understanding before the Fall 'was vegete, quick, and lively; open as the Day, untainted as the Morning, full of the Innocence and Spriteliness of Youth; it gave the Soul a bright and a full View into all things; and was not only a Window, but itself the Prospect'. Adam 'had no Catechism but the Creation, need no Study but Reflection, read no Book but the Volume of the World'.59 In our postlapsarian state, we must take more conscious prospects. Inwardly, we must take a moral prospect of our own conduct: 'the Change and Passage from a State of Nature to a State of Virtue, is laborious . . . The ascent up the Hill is hard and tedious, but the Serenity and fair Prospect at the Top, is sufficient.'60 Such allegorical topography was scarcely new, its classic expression being Bunyan's Pilgrim's progress (1678-84), but its vitality continued in the eighteenth century in such works as Johnson's Vision of Theodore (1744), which maintained the conflation of religious and topographical discourse. There is a 'universe of analogy' within which Johnson's Dictionary operates: 'Johnson matches the physical scale of analogy, but especially the lower, mechan- ical, and elemental end of it, against the realm of mind.'61 This universe applied more widely in eighteenth-century society: 'it was assumed that God, expressing Himself in all creation, made the physical, moral and spiritual levels analogous to each other and to himself.'62 Given this analogical linkage, it is appropriate rather than accidental that Johnson's Dictionary should illustrate two key words in the spiritual and physical realms - faith and vision - with the same Ecumene 1996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="11">464 Robert J. Mayhew illustration from Henry Hammond's Practical catechism: "Vision in the next life is the perfecting of that faith in this life, or that faith is turned into vision there, as hope into enjoying.' There is, then, a theological as well as a political resonance to the language of landscape. This overlap is unsurprising given, as we have seen, that the lan- guage of politics derived from and fed back into that of religion. Just as the pol- itics of landscape was part of a broader hierarchical framework, so the political language of landscape was also part of a political theological language estab- lished by the 'universe of analogy' current in the eighteenth century. The breakdown of the ancien régime view of landscape This scale of values began to break down around the time of the French Revolution. As we have seen, both Gilpin and Price still used an ethical justi- factory language, yet their writings also acted to create a separate aesthetic realm. Gilpin recognized this, accepting that 'moral, and picturesque ideas do not always coincide'; there was a contradiction in the Picturesque between a flight from luxury to find moral purity in the countryside, and a consciousness that it was itself a product of that luxury which focuses on the aesthetic, not the moral.63 While Gilpin was still struggling to reconcile these differences, Knight's The Landscape rejected the ancien régime mentality as applied to the landscape: I assure Mr Rep ton, however, that I will never follow the example which he has set, in his Letter to Mr Price, of endeavouring to involve speculative differences of opin- ion, upon subjects of mere elegant amusement, with the nearest and dearest inter- ests of humanity ... To say that his own system of rural embellishment resembles the British constitution, and that Mr Price's and mine resemble the Democratic tyranny of France, is a species of argument which any person may employ on any occasion, without being at the expense either of sense or science.64 These words act in several ways which betoken the end of the mode of thought in which landscape had previously worked. First, the language adopted is con- cerned with the factional politics of specific group interests rather than the broader politico-ethical notions of governance and the common good; secondly, Knight (and Repton, his accuser) self-consciously deploy landscape as a metaphor, relinquishing the fused vision of land, man, and God which Windsor Forest had displayed; and thirdly, having rendered the analogical reasoning of the anden régime explicit, Knight rejects it, ridiculing the 'endeavour to find analogies between picturesque composition and political confusion; or suppose that the preservation of trees and terraces has any connection with the destruc- tion of states and kingdoms'.65 This shift in landscape aesthetics has been interpreted as a dehistoricization, moving away from the 'didactic voice' of the eighteenth century.66 As such, attempts after the late eighteenth century to reconnect the political and the nat- ural were 'counter hegemonic' projects, such as that developed by the Chartists: 'the specificity and peculiarity of the Chartist poetic being its yoking of explic- itly political claims and aims to a landscape poetic that had, by the end of the Ecumene 1 996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="12">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteenth^century England 465 1830s, come to be habitually identified with concepts of aesthetic autonomy and a poetic of private meditation.'67 To fuse nature and politics was now a self-con- scious act of retrieval (in the Chartists' case, of the radical tradition of Paine and Price), rather than the product of a set of tacitly accepted cultural presup- positions, as it had been for much of the eighteenth century. It was also to revive a link on the basis of a rapidly shifting notion of political discourse, wherein the factitious nature of politics, and politics of nature, was becoming increas- ingly apparent: 'speculations concerning the nature of humankind, of society and even of Nature now came under even closer scrutiny for their implications in the battle to maintain the ideological support of the established order in Church and State.'68 The natural world was increasingly something to be appre- hended scientifically or appreciated aesthetically, rather than a site for associa- tive reasoning connecting religious, moral, and natural discourse. Wordsworth's Romanticism, for example, denied the legitimacy of associative reasoning, argu- ing that landscape - had not need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrow'd from the eye69 John Ruskin, in the generation after the early Romantics, could move between 'High Tory' and 'radical, [the] reddest of the red', but still upheld the moral and aesthetic autonomy of the landscape. Clearly, the analogical mode of link- ing landscape and politics of the eighteenth century had disappeared: where Johnson's aesthetic would not heed such nonsense as a blade of grass, prefer- ring more important themes in his hierarchy of values, Ruskin's aesthetic urged that we begin precisely with the close study of a single blade of grass.70 The breakdown of the assumptions framing landscape debates was, of course, part of a broader pattern of change in the connection of religious and politi- cal discourse. If there was a unifying theme in political discourse from 1500 to 1790 it was 'more English than British or imperial: the construction, crisis and survival of the unified sovereignty in church and state proclaimed during the reign of Henry VIII'; but events 'occurring about the outbreak of war with rev- olutionary France, increasingly belong to a history shaped by forces other than those which have been invoked'.71 This shift in political discourse parallels that already noted with respect to the politics of landscape: the emergence of 'a pol- itics of class more modern than anything Burke had recognised'.72 This also broke the connection of religious and political discourse so important to the anden régime and so amply reflected in the map of discursive connections estab- lished in landscape debates. 'There was a fundamental change in emphasis in Christian argument from political theory to social theory in the 1790s. This was accompanied by a decline in the use of religious arguments in political theory in favour of secular ones.'73 Such a shift to recognize the autonomy of discur- sive realms rather than their analogical connection is precisely what Knight's words on the picturesque also amount to. Elements of the old structure of argument about landscape survived into the early nineteenth century: Ecumene 1996 3 (4)</page><page sequence="13">466 Robert J. Mayhew At least from the country house poem of the seventeenth century to Sir Walter Scott's essay on landscape gardening in the Quarterly Review (1828) an anti-improvement sen- timent persists . . . Changes are pernicious because they are extravagant, or they pro- mote the vanity of the improver rather than the welfare of the estate, or they ignore 'use', or they desecrate the social virtues of hospitality and good housekeeping.74 Similarly, in that locus classicus of reflection on the landscape, the topographical poem, 'the latest hill poem by an author of any consequence is Bowles's Banwell Hill (1828)'. 75 Yet these were the remnants of a once hegemonic structure of thought. Where Clark sees the collapse of the institutional anden régime as a sud- den betrayal in the 1830s, the decline in its intellectual validity for the govern- ing classes themselves had begun long before this, as Pocock has suggested, and was reflected in the debates about landscape and nature discussed here.76 Conclusion: revisionism and the role of landscape The importance of Christian discourse to eighteenth-century landscape debates is not, of course, a new discovery. In 1958, for example, R0stvig said of James Thomson that 'one of our most important findings is concerned with the inti- mate connection between world view, morals and landscape aesthetics . . . Again and again we have seen how the poet's appreciation of the varied landscape was directly conditioned by his belief in the benevolence of God and in the per- fection of the whole cosmic and terrestrial plan.'77 The problem has been how to reconcile the Christian nature of landscape discourse with the accepted pic- ture of eighteenth-century England as a rapidly secularizing society. Revisionist historiography helps to dissolve the categories which created this problem. 'Modern' demands for political reform were often couched in a 'traditional' lan- guage of religion, just as 'modern' concern for landscape drew upon the resources of a Christian and classical culture; in short, whilst the battle between 'Ancients' and 'Moderns' rumbled on through the eighteenth century,78 the his- toriographical dualism of 'traditional' and 'modernizing' had no meaning in the self-understanding of those deploying the language of politics or landscape in the period. Whilst revisionist historiography has been increasingly apprecia- tive of the continued strength of hierarchical values in the politics and society of eighteenth-century England, landscape studies have moved towards an essen- tially modern interpretation of the motivations of landscape appreciation, at odds both with this new historiography and intellectual history and with much of the writing about landscape prior to the 1980s. The gap between ideas and society which landscape studies has attempted to close from one direction, by moving towards a socioeconomic contextualization, is perhaps more effectively closed by a shift from the other direction, towards a less secular history of eigh- teenth-century English ideologies, aiming to analyse the mentalités of the creators of the printed discourse relating to the natural world and landscape, coupled with a recognition of the complexity of the relationship between languages of debate and the societies in which they occur. Fusing the traditional understanding that approaches to the natural world and landscape remained within a Christian framework with more recent concern for Ecumene 1 99 6 3 (4)</page><page sequence="14">Landscape, religion, and knowledge in eighteentlvcentury England 467 the politics of landscape generates a contextual understanding of the intellec- tual structures of the ruling orders. The hierarchy discussed here shows the pro- found difference of the eighteenth-century English conception of the scope and meaning of landscape from that of today. This not only moves us towards a con- textual understanding of the ruling orders of the period, but also deepens our understanding of the strategies of subversion deployed by those opponents, who were necessarily responsive to the argumentation of the hegemonic position. Revisionism, then, can lead to new understandings of landscape ideas even in areas as intensely studied as those of eighteenth-century England. If, for exam- ple, there have been numerous languages of political discourse, and the rela- tion of these languages to other discourses, such as religious and moral debates, has changed over time, there can be no universal approach to the 'politics of landscape', only a situated one. In its sensitivity to the languages of debate in historical and geographical context, and its awareness that these display a dynamic of their own which cannot simply be mapped onto social-historical real- ities, revisionism makes distinctions of great importance to students of environ- mental history and discourses about that history.

This does not mean that politics itself was not factious, but that its lan- guage, like that of Anglicanism (see above) , tried to claim the centre ground, in this case defined (as Miller, Defining the common goody says) around notions of politics as being in the interest of the common good, not for the benefit of specific groups. 45 J.

Sack, From Jacobite to conservative : reaction and orthodoxy in Bńtain, c.1760-1832 (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1993), chs 5, 8, 9, has also discussed the subordination of monarchical to religious allegiance in what he calls the right-wing mentality of the late eighteenth century. Pocock's work has mainly attracted interest in landscape studies for its discussion of a secular lan- guage of civic humanism (see Barrell, Political theory of painting and Painting and the politics of culture) . Yet Pocock's more recent work (see the reference in this note and in n. 71) has been far closer to Clark's work in emphasizing that religion remained of importance to many of the influential political languages in the period (see Clark, Language of liberty , pp. 20-9). Pocock's attraction to 'the historical counter-whiggery' of Clark's work in his recent writings has been noted by reviewers; see J. Bossy, 'Down with discourse', Times Literary Supplement , 7 Apr. 1995, p. 28.
