INTRODUCTION Misconceptions about Comte's three-state law abound in the historical and philosophical literature. It is usually believed that Comte claims that societies as a whole pass through the theological, metaphysical, and positive states, with each of these states representing some sort of organic whole including all aspects of society. Transitions from one state to the next are seen as repre- senting historical discontinuities.' Commentators also hold that the law is based on a priori considerations concerning human nature and not on history.2 Through an exegetical analysis of Comte's three-state law, his arguments in support of this law, and his views on historical method, I hope to show that all of these beliefs are false. In doing so, I am not attempting to secure Comte's three-state law on a firm foundation so much as to remove a certain kind of objection to it. This objection, which has been most clearly expressed by Popper, states that it is not properly speaking a law at all, but rather a mere historical trend or pattern of development.3 II. COMTE'S THREE-STATE LAW AND THE HIERARCHY OF THE SCIENCES Comte never says that society as a whole passes through three states. His three-state law is above all a law concerning the historical development of our methods of cognitive inquiry: "the human mind, by its nature, successively employs in each one of its researches three methods of philosophizing, of which the character is essentially different and even radically opposed: at first the theological method, then the metaphysical method, and finally the positive method" (C I, 21).4 Only the succession of methods used, and not the beliefs 1.

He characterizes each of these "methods of philosophizing" in terms of the explanatory goals man sets for himself in each state. Etymologically speaking, to use a method is to follow a path. As we choose our roads accord- ing to our destination, so, too, are the paths taken by philosophers chosen in accordance with their goals. Comte assumes that the basic goal of all philos- ophy is the explanation of natural phenomena. Philosophers differ in their goals to the extent to which they differ in what they will accept as an explana- tion. The theological method leads to explanations of natural phenomena which posit supernatural entities with causal efficacy: In the theological state, the human mind, essentially directing its researches towards the intimate nature of beings, the first and final causes of all the effects which strike it, in a word, towards absolute knowledge, represents the phenomena to itself as produced by the direct and continuous action of more or less numerous supernatural entities, of which the arbitrary intervention explains all the apparent anomalies of the universe (C I, 21). Comte further subdivides the theological state into the fetishistic, polytheistic, and monotheistic substates.5 The human mind moves through these three substates by a process of abstraction (C II, 264); for example, the dryads assigned to each tree come to be replaced by a god of the forest, who eventu- ally gives way to a Supreme Being. Matter is conceived of as utterly passive, with the supernatural beings supplying its active principles (C I, 230). In the monotheistic state, these principles emanate from a Supreme Being. edited by Michael Serres, et. al. (Paris, 1975), rather than to those of Comte's original six-volume edition. The three-state law is not entirely original with Comte. It was first proposed in 1750 by Turgot in his "Plan de deux discours sur l'histoire universelle." The latter conceives of it as a generalization concerning the progression of different types of explanatory hypotheses which have been used by man. (Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, "On Universal History," in Turgot on Progress, Sociology, and Economics, ed. R. L. Meek [Cambridge, 1973], 102.) However, I believe that it would be a mistake to charge Comte with a simple case of plagiarism. Smile Littre, in an attempt to defend his former master from this charge, points out that Turgot does not integrate this law into his philosophical system as does Comte. milee Littre, Auguste Comte et la philosophic positive, 2nd ed. [Paris, 1864], 48.) In fact, Turgot does not even conceive of this succession of three states as constituting a law, let alone as a fundamental law of his system. He is, above all, a political economist. Like Marx, he offers explanations of historical change in terms relating to the modes of economic production. For example, Turgot considers the differences among hunting, herding, and farming to be far more historically significant than the differences among theological explanations, explanations through essences, and explanations in terms of form and motion. 5. Comte borrows these concepts from Henri Benjamin Constant de Rebecque's De la Religion, consideree dans sa source, ses formes, et ses developpements (5 vols., Paris, 1825-1831). In this work, Constant attempts to demonstrate that fetishism and polytheism are not merely degenerate forms of the original monotheism of Adam and Eve, but instead are the historical antecedents of monotheism.</page><page sequence="3">250 WARREN SCHMAUS By developing the habit of mentioning only these active principles, and not the Divinity, when explaining natural phenomena, the human mind in the monotheistic state sets the stage for the metaphysical state. These active prin- ciples begin to be conceived of as entities in their own right (C I, 24-25). The metaphysical state then differs from the theological state not so much with respect to the direction which it gives to philosophizing; it still proffers explanations in terms of causal entities. Instead, the difference between these two states merely concerns the sort of causal entities which each posits: In the metaphysical state, which is basically but a simple modification of the first, the supernatural agents are replaced by abstract forces, veritable entities (personi- fied abstractions) inherent in the various beings of the world, and conceived of as capable of engendering by themselves all the observed phenomena, of which the explanation in that case consists in assigning the corresponding entity for each one (CI, 21). In the late Middle Ages, a debate grew up around the interpretation to be given to these abstract causal entities. Are they to be considered real entities in themselves, or are they to be considered mere names given to the phenomena for our convenience? Comte believes the nominalists to have defeated the realists in these debates. To the extent to which the nominalists held that we could not attain knowledge of the real essences of things, they believed the search for absolute knowledge to be in vain.6 Their "victory" over the realists constitutes, for Comte, the first victory of the positive philosophy over the metaphysical (C II, 569). Indeed, Comte considers it to be the most decisive step in the subsequent history of philosophy until Hume's analysis of causation (S III, 541).7 In contradistinction to the gradual transition from the theological to the metaphysical state, the transition from the latter to the positive state represents a radical change for Comte. The quest for absolute knowledge is abandoned, and man now seeks explanations of natural phenomena in terms of general facts concerning invariable relations among phenomena, rather than in terms of causes or essences: Finally, in the positive state, the human mind, recognizing the impossibility of ob- taining absolute notions, surrenders all claims to search for the origin and the destination of the universe, to attach itself solely to the discovery, by the well- combined usage of reasoning and observation, of their actual laws, which is to say their invariable relations of succession and similitude. The explanation of facts reduced in this case to its real terms, is henceforth nothing more than the linkage 6. Comte's reason for not tracing this philosophical attitude to the ancient Skeptics, as he should, is opaque: "The Greek schools could have never, assuredly, been able to offer a contestation as elevated nor above all as decisive, either for finally destroying the regime of entities, or even for already raising the suspicion of the eminently relative nature of the true philosophy" (C II, 569). 7.

The fact that the laws of positive science express relations among phenom- ena ought not to mislead us into confusing Comte's position with that of the later positivism of Ernst Mach, Bertrand Russell, or the early Rudolf Carnap. Comte is not at all proposing that science be based upon statements which contain direct descriptions of phenomena only, using no theoretical terms. This point can best be expressed through an example. Comte takes Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation as his model for a law of positive science. He is not at all opposed to the use of terms like "gravitation" or "attraction" in the expression of this law. In general, Comte believes that philosophers place too much emphasis on the reform of scientific language. He himself is less con- cerned with the actual words scientists use than with the way in which they are understood. In the present case, a word such as "gravity" is to be under- stood merely as the general name denoting a class of phenomena, and not as a term referring to the causes or the modes of production of these phenomena (C I, 26).8 It is important to stress the fact that Comte says that these three methods of philosophizing are used successively in each one of our researches. In the second lesson of the Cours de philosophic positive, he explains that his three- state law "can not be suitably understood, if one does not in its application combine it with the encyclopedic formula" (C I, 59). This last expression refers to his sixfold classification of the sciences. Comte believes that all of the theoretical sciences can be subsumed under the following six headings: mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology (C I, 58, 63). The order in which these sciences are named is the order in which man has successively applied first the theological and then the metaphysical and finally the positive method to their study (C I, 59). Thus Comte allows for the possibility, say, that man could have simultaneously used the positive method in mathematics, the metaphysical method in physics, and the theologi- cal method in biology. It is precisely because most readers have misunderstood him to be saying that societies as a whole pass through three states that Comte was able to boast that no one had raised any "serious objections" to the law in seventeen years (C II, 227). This was increased to "over thirty years" in the Systeme de politique positive (S III, 41).9 All of the objections which have been 8. Comte has similar discussions concerning the use of the terms "light ray" (C I, 460) and "heat ray" (C I, 487). 9. Comte is referring to the time elapsed since the first appearance of the three-state law in the "Plan des travaux scientifiques necessaires pour reorganiser la society" of 1822. Here the three-state law takes much the same form as it does in the Cours: "By the very nature of the human mind, each branch of our knowledge is necessarily subject</page><page sequence="5">252 WARREN SCHMAUS raised, he says, commit the fundamental mistake of failing to appreciate the auxiliary role played by his sixfold classification of the sciences. Comte never claims that our entire system of beliefs passes as a whole from one state to the next. He rather envisions this as a gradual process, with each science pass- ing through these states independently of those which follow it in his classifica- tory scheme. Thus the fact that scholars have been able to point to the coexistence of the theological, metaphysical, and positive modes of thought at various times in history does not at all constitute a refutation of the three- state law for Comte (S III, 41) .10 Nor is he dogmatic about there being six and only six sciences, now and for all time: "One cannot objectively fix the number of sciences . . . Basically, the name consecrated for each science merely designates the group of specula- tions for which the unity finds itself sufficiently recognized; which ought to vary in accordance with the time and the intellect" (S IV, 187). Comte him- self adds a seventh science, that of morality, to his classificatory scheme in the Systeme (S II, 432f). He will allow for any number of sciences in his hierarchy, with any number of subdivisions within each science, as long as they are ordered in accordance with the same principle. This principle calls for the sciences to be classified in the order prescribed by their degrees of generality, simplicity, abstraction, and the degree of "independence" of the phenomena which form their explanatory realms (C I, 54, 58, 64). That is, because the class of phenomena studied by any science is distinguished from the class of phenomena studied by any simpler, more general science merely by the addition of some complicating characteristics, the class of phenomena studied by the first science forms a subset of the class of phenomena studied by the more general science. Thus, any laws discovered at this more general level must also govern the phenomena studied at the less general level. On the other hand, all of the laws discovered at this lower level of generality are not necessarily relevant to all of the phenomena studied at the higher level of generality. For example, living things must obey the laws of chemistry and physics, but the laws of, say, heredity are not relevant to all chemical and physical phenomena. The misunderstanding of the three-state law which Comte had pointed out has recently been perpetuated by Richard Vernon, who attempts to argue that Comte's works "suggest" at least three different conceptions of historical development." The first of these three conceptions, which Vernon finds incon- in its march to successively pass through three different theoretical states: the theo- logical or fictitious state; the metaphysical or abstract state; finally, the scientific or positive state" (S IV, appendix, 77). 10. Forty years later, Robert Flint was still raising this same objection in his Histori- cal Philosophy in France, French Belgium, and Switzerland (New York, 1894). 11. Vernon, 323.</page><page sequence="6">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE'S THREE-STATE LAW 253 sistent with the latter two, relies upon a misconstruction of the three-state law. Without citing any specific references, Vernon claims that the three-state law is one "according to which history in general necessarily develops through three stages, described as theological, metaphysical, and scientific (or posi- tive).'12 He then argues that Comte proceeds to characterize historical devel- opment using "notions such as result, cumulation, and transmission in a manner which is not obviously consistent with the trans-historical law of three states."'13 Read in conjunction with the principle which lies behind Comte's classification of the sciences, however, the three-state law actually implies the very model of continuous, cumulative growth - in which science successively offers an increasing challenge to theology and metaphysics - with which Vernon believes it to be inconsistent. Pascal's analogy between history and the life of an individual is introduced by Comte in order to represent this process of continuous growth: "The entire succession of men, during the long series of centuries, ought to be considered a single man, who lives forever, and who learns continuously" (C II, 83). Comte's three-state law is also entirely con- sistent with what Vernon perceives to be a third model, according to which the present is always the result of the past, and history is to be explained in terms of the transmission of a tradition. The gradual accumulation of knowl- edge gained through the use of the positive method would be impossible without the transmission from one generation to the next of previous applica- tions of this method. III. COMTE'S DEFENSE OF THE THREE-STATE LAW Comte believes that he can defend his three-state law in two different ways: either upon "rational proofs" based upon our knowledge of the human mind, or upon "historical verifications" (C I, 21). It is because Comte offers the first sort of argument that the three-state law has often been attacked as not being an historical law at all, but rather an a priori principle.14 This objection presupposes a sort of naive empiricism, according to which a law must be somehow directly induced from the facts of history in order to count as a genuine historical law. Such a naive view is not at all shared by Comte, and overlooks his theory of the role of hypotheses in science.15 Comte never intended his three-state law to rest on "rational proofs" alone. Rather, as we shall see below, it must stand the-test of history. Comte's "rational proofs" ought rather to be seen as representing the only available path by which he 12. Idem. 13. Ibid., 324. 14.

An hypothesis arrived at in this fashion, Comte is careful to point out, should be regarded merely as a "first sketch" of one's philosophy of history (C II, 159). Nevertheless, it is neces- sary to have such an hypothesis in mind if one is to bring sense and order to the confusing mass of historical facts. Indeed, Comte's "rational proofs" of the three-state law themselves are premised upon the need for hypotheses to guide our making of observations of any sort: in order to apply itself to the making of observations, our mind has need of some sort of theory. If, in contemplating the phenomena, we do not immediately attach them to some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations, and, consequently, to draw any fruit from them, but we would even be entirely incapable of retaining them; and, most often, the facts would remain unperceived before our eyes (C I, 21). He then proceeds to argue that our very first hypotheses could not in principle have been positive hypotheses. Comte begins by pointing out that "every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations" (C I, 23). Primitive man is thus caught in a vicious circle: at the time he begins his investigative activity, he has no set of observations upon which to base any positive hypotheses. Yet he needs some sort of hypotheses, so he turns to theology. In a second argument, Comte claims that our first hypotheses could not have been positive because such hypotheses would not provide sufficient incentive for further inquiry. Only the hope of obtaining knowledge of the intimate nature of beings and of the origin and end of all phenomena can furnish a strong enough motive for early man's engaging in long and arduous research. Such knowledge would make possible man's unlimited control over a world created for his use. For this reason, astrology must of necessity have preceded astronomy and alchemy must have preceded chemistry (C I, 23-24; S IV, appendix, 142). One might take exception to this latter argument and assert that the practical exigencies of life alone may afford sufficient motivation for engaging in research. Even if both of Comte's arguments could be shown to be valid, however, all they would establish is that mankind could not have begun its cognitive activity under the guidance of positive hypotheses. Further premises are needed to establish that man must have chosen theological hypotheses in their stead. Here Comte argues that our earliest speculative activity consisted in the making of analogies, and that such analogical reasoning led to the formation of fetishistic hypotheses. In the earliest stages of the development of mankind, owing to the paucity of external observations upon which to base analogies, man begins by comparing external objects with himself, rather than with each other (S I, 713). Anthropomorphism thus characterizes man's earliest system of beliefs:</page><page sequence="8">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE 'S THREE-STATE LAW 255 The personal action of man on other beings is the only one of which he understands the mode, by the feeling which he has of it. He is thus led to represent to himself in an analogous manner the reaction that the external bodies exert upon him, and in the same way the action which they exert among themselves, and of which he is able to directly see but the results. . . . Man thus begins, necessarily, by seeing all the bodies which fix his attention as so many living beings, with a life analogous to his own, but, in general, superior because of the more powerful action of the majority of them (S IV, appendix, 139-140). Comte criticizes fetishistic reasoning for confounding all activity whatsoever with that of life alone.'6 The activity manifested by living beings ought to be viewed as but one species of activity. If one indiscriminately postulates on an ad hoc basis the existence of a will in order to account for a given phenom- enon, one has in fact explained nothing. Such a method cannot reveal any of the general laws which govern the phenomenon, and which allow for predic- tions of future occurrences of similar phenomena. F. A. Hayek criticizes Comte's argument that mankind necessarily began with the fetishistic method on the grounds that it contradicts arguments Comte gives elsewhere against the efficacy of introspective methods in psychology and philosophy. If we cannot observe the workings of our minds through intro- spection, Hayek argues, then how can Comte claim that early man could understand the mode of his actions on other beings?'7 Hayek assumes that Comte is making a larger claim than he actually does. In order to make the sort of analogy Comte describes, all the fetishist needs to know is that he has a will. This sort of knowledge requires no great feat of introspection. Comte never says that the fetishist has any need for detailed knowledge of the opera- tions of the will. Comte also provides sociological reasons for believing that mankind must have first used hypotheses of a fetishistic nature. Fetishism, he says, does not require the existence of a priesthood, owing to the nature of its beliefs. Not only is it not required, but the immediacy of the fetish renders a priesthood useless. Everyone is his own minister; an intermediary between the believer and his god is not necessary as it is in polytheism (C II, 252). In fetishistic religion, "every observable body spontaneously becomes the proper subject of a direct superstition" (C II, 250). To the extent to which other forms of religious belief demand the existence of a priesthood in order to interpret the will of the gods, they presuppose a society with highly evolved distinctions in social role. Even if this argument were historically accurate, however, it does not establish a necessary connection between fetishism and the absence of a priesthood. Furthermore, it is not even historically accurate. There are forms 16.

Hayek, The Counter-Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason (New York, 1955), 139.</page><page sequence="9">256 WARREN SCHMAUS of monotheistic religious belief that do not necessitate an intermediary between a believer and his god. Another sociological argument is premised upon the belief that a society needs some system of ideas in order to suppress individuality and create order. Mankind could not wait the centuries requisite for the full maturity of the positive philosophy, so it adopted the theological philosophy to fulfill this role. As a matter of fact, order being a necessary condition for progress, the devel- opment of scientific method would have been impossible without the order provided by the acceptance of theologism (S IV, appendix, 143). Without the division of labor which social order makes possible, a speculative, scientific class could not arise: "No development of the mind is possible except through the division of labor" (S IV, appendix, 164). Comte's argument for the second state being the metaphysical is virtually unproblematic, if one accepts his arguments for our necessarily having to be- gin with the theological and end with the positive philosophy. This argument simply points to the need for some intermediate state between these latter two philosophies (S IV, appendix, 144; C I, 24). When we turn to his arguments for our necessarily arriving at the positive as the final state in our cognitive development, we find that he believes that the seeds of the positive method were actually sown during the earliest stages of the development of humanity (C II, 222-223). As the positive method was slowly extended through the hierarchy of the sciences, it came more and more into conflict with theology and metaphysics. Comte's arguments for the final preponderance of the posi- tive philosophy is thus an argument for its necessarily having to win this struggle. This struggle arises from the difference in the kinds of explanations offered by each philosophy. The theological method explains phenomena in terms of supernatural wills. It can thus offer no guarantee of regularity in nature. In fact, it assures us of the very opposite: "The fundamental character of every theological philosophy . . . is to conceive of phenomena as subject to super- natural wills, and consequently, as eminently and irregularly variable" (C I, 454; see also S I, 10). Such regularity, however, is exactly what is presupposed in our practical affairs. In order to be able to choose the proper course of action in a given situation, we must be able to predict with some degree of certainty the possible outcomes of the various alternatives available to us. Only through a knowledge of natural laws is such prediction made possible (C I, 45). As it is the positive philosophy which aims "to discover the laws of phenomena" (C I, 24), the positive method owes its birth to the practical exigencies of life. In the end, Comte believes, man will give up the theological method simply because it bears no practical fruit. Nor will it lead to any important new dis- coveries. In modern terms, the positive method alone appears to be a progres- sive research program for Comte:</page><page sequence="10">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE 'S THREE-STATE LAW 257 The vigor and the influence of a method is measured by the number and the importance of its applications: those which no longer produce anything soon abso- lutely cease to be used. But, as in at least the last two centuries, the theological and metaphysical methods, which had presided over the first trials of our intelli- gence, have become entirely sterile; as the most extensive and most important discoveries . . . have been, since this epoch, due solely to the use of the positive method, it is evident, by this fact alone, that it is to the latter to which the exclusive direction of human thought will henceforth belong (S IV, appendix, 145). For all of its modernity, however, there are still some serious gaps in this argument. If, as Comte says, explanation through the postulation of wills is incompatible with the requirements of practical life from the very first, how is it possible that the theological and metaphysical methods ever came to be adopted in the first place? To say that these methods have become sterile is to suggest that at one time they were not. If this were true, Comte would not be able to say that knowledge of the laws of phenomena alone is capable of guiding us in modifying the phenomena to our advantage. Instead, he must say that such knowledge is more successful in guiding such activity. There remains one final point to clear up. Comte claims that theological methods have been sterile for at least two hundred years. It would seem, then, that theological hypotheses would have been abandoned. On the contrary, however, they are still with us a century and a half later. Thus it is clear that practical considerations alone do not dictate our choice of explanatory hypoth- eses. Comte himself points out that "it would be to form a very imperfect idea of the sciences to conceive of them solely as the foundations of the arts" (C I, 45). He feels that we pursue knowledge of the natural world not only as a guide for practical action, but because in addition we have a direct need to be able to explain natural phenomena. To prove the existence of this need, Comte points to the adverse physiological effects that may result from the astonishment one experiences in observing some phenomenon which seems to contradict the laws of nature (C I, 45; S I, 414). We need to dispose the facts about nature in some easily conceivable order to make them less frighten- ing to us. This need is "so inherent," Comte says, that if we cannot satisfy it with positive concepts, we will inevitably turn to theological and metaphysical hypotheses (C I, 45). According to Comte, this need exists not only at the individual level, but at the societal level as well. In order for men to come together and form a society, he believes, they must share a system of beliefs which answers this need. Comte places two conditions upon such a set of beliefs: first, it must represent a consensus: everyone must believe the same thing (C II, 732-733); second, this set of beliefs must be consistent with itself. So far, Comte main- tains, only monotheistic theology, with its attribution of all natural phenom- ena to a single Supreme Will, is able to meet this latter criterion (C II, 19). In fact, the desire for such consistency was the prime motivating force for</page><page sequence="11">258 WARREN SCHMAUS the development of monotheism from polytheism in the first place (C II, 22). Polytheism allows for the wills of several gods to come into conflict with one another, and thus can guarantee neither any regularity in natural phenomena nor any consistency in our explanations of them. On the other hand, even if the will of a monotheistic God may be just as unpredictable, to the extent that all natural phenomena can be attributed to a single will which cannot come into conflict with itself, these phenomena can at least receive a consistent set of explanations. The positive philosophy will only be able to supplant the theological and metaphysical philosophies once it similarly provides a consis- tent set of explanations for all classes of natural phenomena. The "historical verifications" of Comte's three-state law are constituted by his account of the development of the sciences in the first three volumes of the Cours de philosophic positive. Michael Uta has made the charge that this historical account serves less to verify the three-state law than the three-state law serves as a guide to the interpretation of history. Thus he insists upon the a priori character of this law."8 Uta either overlooks Comte's discussion of the need for hypotheses in science, or is being unfair. One cannot reasonably expect Comte to bring forth counter-instances to his own historical hypothesis. Uta goes on to claim that this law receives only a partial vertification from intellectual history; it "explains neither moral development nor aesthetic development.'19 To bring this charge is to misinterpret the three-state law in the same way as Vernon has; that is, Uta must believe that Comte intends his law as governing "history in general." Only episodes from the history of science are relevant to the confirmation of the three-state law as Comte expresses it. In order to counter-instantiate it, either we would have to demonstrate that at some point in history some sci- ence has abandoned explanations in terms of natural law in favor of explana- tions in terms of causally efficacious entities or deities. Or, we would have to bring forth an instance in which we have achieved positive explanations for some special class of phenomena before we have done so for some more general class of which this special class forms a subset. There appears to be no reason in principle for such counter-instances not to be forthcoming. In such an eventuality, Comte would have to concede that his three-state law is false. Yet even if this came to pass, Comte would not be seriously troubled: if it is possible that I am mistaken about the true law of higher human evolution, only the necessity of establishing a better sociological doctrine would rationally result thereby, and I would have no less irrevocably constituted, in this subject, the sole method capable of leading to the positive knowledge of the human mind (C II, 728). 18. Uta, 206n. 19. Idem.</page><page sequence="12">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE'S THREE-STATE LAW 259 IV. COMTE'S HISTORICAL METHOD Comte's definition of the historical method of sociology reveals that he believes that a necessary part of it concerns the classification of history into a series of successive states: "The essential spirit of this historical method properly so-called appears to me to consist in the rational use of social series, that is to say in a successive appreciation of the various states of humanity (C II, 151). The three-state law provides one example of this concept of a "social" or "sociological series." Comte claims that this concept constitutes the "philosophical equivalent" of the concept of the "organic series" (C II, 127), which he understands to be that of a linear ordering (C I, 772) of animal species according to their relative degrees of anatomical complexity, with human beings as the most complex species (C I, 700). Although he describes the social and organic series as "philosophically equivalent," Comte unfortunately does not provide the reader with an explicit definition of his concept of philosophical equivalence. He does make it clear, however, that he is not claiming that they are simply one and the same: "the comparison of diverse parts of the biological hierarchy . . . cannot . . . have, in sociology, [anything] but a secondary importance" (C II, 144). This is because animal societies cannot be said to have a history in the sense in which human societies do. Animal societies, Comte says, do not manifest any- thing like the phenomenon of "the gradual and continuous influence of human generations upon one another" (C II, 159). It is the study of this phenomenon which above all serves to distinguish the science of sociology from that of biology, according to Comte (C II, 159; see also C I, 57). Although compari- sons with other species may help us achieve an understanding of the "first generations" of man (C II, 145), they are of no use in the study of the cumu- lative influence of successive generations (C II, 159). Nor are comparisons with the successive stages in the life of an individual of use here (C II, 124). An individual's life is simply too brief to reveal laws of intellectual develop- ment (S III, 46). Pascal's analogy only works for Comte because it concerns a hypothetical individual who lives forever. In order to represent this phenomenon of the cumulative influence of human generations, we must adopt the notion of a sociological series. Comte conceives of this series as a "simple, gradual prolongation" of the animal series (C II, 767; see also C II, 673, 202). However, an important difference between them is that whereas the terms of the latter are coexistent, the terms of the former succeed one another in time (C II, 767). This difference calls for a new method of study in sociology. Comte tells us that this new method "consists in the historical mode properly so-called, constituting the investigation, not by simple comparison, but by gradual filiation" (C II, 748). He adds that although this new means of investigation is "necessarily derivative from the</page><page sequence="13">260 WARREN SCHMAUS comparative mode proper to biology," it is nevertheless "radically distin- guished" from it (C II, 766). Again, Comte fails to provide the reader with an explicit definition, in this case one for the concept of filiationn." Fortunately, he does furnish a very re- vealing footnote, in which he contrasts historical filiation with mere historical description. He criticizes a recent, unnamed work on the history of mathe- matics in seventeenth-century Italy for containing too much of the latter and not enough of the former. Specifically, the author (also unnamed20) is criticized on three counts. With regard to the first, Comte is willing to excuse the author, because of "reigning prejudices," for restricting his researches to the history of the mathematical sciences alone. Nevertheless, he believes that the development of mathematics "has actually been linked, especially at that time, to that of the other sciences, and even to the whole of human pro- gress" (C II, 149n). Comte is implicitly criticizing the author for failing to bring these historical linkages to light. With regard to the other two counts, Comte is less willing to excuse the author: "one cannot abstain from openly condemning the irrational limitation of the subject to a single nation and a single century" (ibid.). Mathematical progress, he adds, does not take place in any one country independently of the simultaneous developments taking place elsewhere. Nor can we understand the state of geometry in the seven- teenth century in isolation from its anterior developments. There is a common principle behind all three of Comte's criticisms: all three concern the author's isolation of a part from a whole. This part-whole relation is parceled out, in Comte's critique, in terms of the relations of part of our body of knowledge to the whole of it, the relations of developments in one nation to those represented by all of humanity, the relations of one historical period to all of history, and even the relation between a part and "the whole of human progress." That which distinguishes filiations from mere description, then, is that the former relates part to whole while the latter does not.21 To construct linear social series which will represent the whole of human development, Comte would have us adopt Condorcet's method of construct- ing the hypothesis of a single developmental path followed by all people: In order to more suitably fix our ideas, it is important to first establish, by an in- 20. I suspect that the work which Comte has in mind may be Guillaume Libri's Histoire des sciences mathematiques en Italie depuis la renaissance des lettres jusqu'a la fin du 17e siecle (4 vols., Paris, 1838-1841). Comte's footnote appears in the fourth volume of his original six-volume edition of the Cours, which was published in 1839. I imagine that he may have just become acquainted with the first volume of Libri's work as he was preparing the fourth volume of the Cours for the press, and that this footnote was added at this time. 21. This interpretation of the concept of filiation is borne out by remarks Comte makes elsewhere about not isolating the history of any science from that of the whole of human development (C II, 149, 173).</page><page sequence="14">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE S THREE-STATE LAW 261 dispensable scientific abstraction, in accordance with the successful artifice judi- ciously instituted by Condorcet, the necessary hypothesis of a single people to whom may be ideally attributed all the consecutive social modifications actually observed among the distinct populations (C II, 123).22 Comte believes that because human nature is everywhere one and the same, society will always develop in accordance with the same laws. These laws can be discovered through a study of the "most advanced" human societies. Local factors such as race and climate cannot change the nature of this development. They merely affect the rate at which the society in question passes from one state to the next in the social series (C II, 132, 147). For this reason, Comte believes non-Western societies merely to represent earlier states of social de- velopment through which western Europe has already passed (C II, 146). In spite of their methodological agreement, however, Comte finds fault with Condorcet's division of history into epochs, arguing that it "does not even satisfy the most palpable of conditions, that of presenting an homogeneous series" (S IV, appendix, 110). Instead, Condorcet merely chose, nearly at random, some remarkable event, "sometimes industrial, sometimes scientific, sometimes political" (ibid.)23 to be the beginning of each epoch. Rather than choosing such events at random, Comte believes that they should be chosen in accordance with the general conception of the work: "The principal divi- sion into epochs ought to present the most general insight into the history of civilization" (S IV, appendix, 111). Successive divisions are then to offer successively more precise insights. "In a word, the table of epochs ought to be fixed in such a way as to offer, by itself alone, a summary expression of the whole of the work" (ibid.). In contrast to Condorcet's division of history into epochs, Comte's three- state law, insofar as it concerns the progressive development of man's cognitive methods alone, does present an homogeneous series. The general insight into history which it provides, according to Comte, is one of progress taking place in accordance with inexorable laws: "The whole of scientific evolution . . . more clearly than any other, suggests the idea of a true progression, of which the terms succeed each other by an irrecusable necessary filiation" (C II, 576). 22. In order to make use of the great number of facts presented by history, Condorcet says, "it is necessary to choose them from that (i.e., the history) of different peoples, to compare them, to combine them, in order to draw from them the hypothetical history of a single people, and to form the tableau of its progress" (Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progress de l'esprit humain [Paris, 1933], 8). 23. Condorcet's nine historical epochs are: (1) the hunting and fishing stage; (2) the pastoral stage; (3) the agricultural stage; (4) the age of the Greeks; (5) the age of the Romans; (6) the middle ages up until the Crusades; (7) the late middle ages, beginning with the Crusades; (8) the period beginning with the invention of printing; (9) the period initiated by Descartes's philosophical and methodological revolution, ending with the French Revolution, 1789. He also has a tenth epoch, constituting the future, begin- ning with the French Revolution.</page><page sequence="15">262 WARREN SCHMAUS In short, Comte believes his three-state law to succeed as a classification of historical epochs where Condorcet's classification fails. Comte then proceeds to use the three-state law of scientific progress as a basis from which to argue for the existence of laws of progress governing other aspects of society. First, he appeals to the fact that changes in one aspect of society will bring about changes in other aspects in an attempt to establish the existence of laws of social statics, the science of social equilibria (C II, 112). He then reasons that in addition there must be laws of social dynamics which describe the development of aspects of society other than its scientific develop- ment. These other aspects of society must progress in order to keep pace with scientific developments, so as to avoid the "entire decomposition of the sys- tem" (C II, 126). Indeed, as we have seen above, an orderly society is even a necessary condition for continued scientific progress. Of course, all that the premises of this argument can establish is the fact of social change. They do not demonstrate that the laws which explain how societies adapt to scientific progress must themselves be laws of progress. Ultimately, Comte feels the need to establish the existence of progress in at least three aspects of society in order to confirm his hypothesis that human society as a whole manifests progress: "this auspicious innovation can in no wise bear fruit as long as its actual verification remains limited to a single, partial evolution . .; at least two cases are necessary to rise, through their comparison, to a lasting generalization . . .; and, besides, a third case still becomes indispensable for confirming the original comparison" (C II, 576). Scientific progress, as characterized by his three-state law, constitutes Comte's first case, and he cites industrial progress as a second case (C II, 211). By his own admission, he still needs a third case of progress in order to confirm his hypothesis that all aspects of society exhibit progress. Even if he could confirm this hypothesis, however, there would still remain the problem of demonstrating that this progress could only be explained in terms of laws which have some peculiar historical or developmental character. Comte attempts to argue specifically for the existence of a law governing political progress from two closely related premises. The first one states that: "the laws of social dynamics ought necessarily to be more knowable to the extent that they concern more extended populations, where the secondary perturbations have less influence" (C II, 126). This premise is consistent with Comte's belief that the analysis of the successive stages in the life of an indi- vidual is of little help in establishing social series. Perturbations which may obscure the individual case will cancel out in larger samples. The second premise states that: "The fundamental laws also become, of necessity, more irresistible . . . to the extent that they are applied to a more advanced civilization . . ." (ibid.). Except for the reference to the laws becoming more "irresistible," this premise could actually follow from the first, insofar</page><page sequence="16">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE S THREE-STATE LAW 263 as Comte believes that the advance of civilization is tied to the growth of population (C II, 128).24 Finally, Comte "combines" these two premises to yield a third premise according to which "the fundamental evolution of humanity, judged compara- tively upon the diverse social aspects, ought to be . . . that much the more necessarily subject to imperative natural laws to the extent that it concerns more complex (compose) phenomena, where the irregularities which arise from any individual influences whatsoever ought naturally to become more obliterated" (C II, 126). Social phenomena are more "compose" to the extent that they involve more people. Given that political life involves more people than does scientific research, Comte is able to use this third premise to argue for the existence of laws governing political progress: One thus imagines what an irrational consequence it must be today, for example, to regard, on the one hand, scientific activity as subject to positive laws, and, on the other hand, political activity as arbitrary; because, basically, the latter, in virtue of its superior complication, dominating the individual perturbations more, ought to be still more inevitably predetermined than the other, where personal genius cer- tainly exercises more command (C II, 126-127). This argument at best may establish that political behavior is law-governed; it does not, however, demonstrate that it is governed specifically by historical laws. Although Comte argues in the Cours de philosophic positive for the exis- tence of such laws, it is not until fourteen years later, in the Systeme de politique positive, that he postulates any multistate laws of political progress. One of these laws governs the development of political and economic activity from the conquering or military state, through the defensive or feudal state, and finally to the industrial state (S III, 63). Another aspect of society is governed by a law which prescribes for the development of moral sentiments from the domestic to the civil and finally to the universal state (S IV, 177). Both of these laws, which are modeled on the three-state law of scientific development, represent homogeneous, linear series. In order to use these laws as the basis for social-scientific predictions, we must study them in such a way as to discover whether or not the succession of various states in each reveals any trends. Predictions based upon the obser- vance of such trends, if they are to be considered valid, must be compared to those obtained through a study of the whole of human development. That 24. Comte was no doubt highly influenced by the Scottish philosophers and political economists in this regard. James Mill, Millar, Robertson, Ferguson, and Adam Smith all held the advance of civilization to be inextricably linked with the growth of popula- tion (J. W. Burrow, Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory [Cam- bridge, 1970], 46 and note). Comte was familiar with the writings of at least the latter two, as their names occur throughout his own work.</page><page sequence="17">264 WARREN SCHMAUS is, after having discovered trends in each of the various social series, we must compare the predictions based on these trends with one another in order to determine whether or not they are consistent with one another.25 The "rational use of social series," Comte says, will show: in accordance with the whole of historical fact, the continuous growth of each disposition whatsoever, material, intellectual, moral, or political, combined with the indefinite decrease of the opposite disposition, from which ought to result the scientific prediction of the final ascendency of the one and the definitive fall of the other, provided that such a conclusion will otherwise fully conform to the system of general laws of human development, of which the indispensable sociological preponderance ought never to be mistaken (C II, 151). Comte adds that we can practice making such predictions through deducing "each historical situation from . . . the whole of its antecedents" (C II, 151- 152). Once we are proficient at this task, we can use the same methods to deduce the future. Comte's sociology "conceives of each of the consecutive states of society as the necessary result of the preceding one and the necessary motor of the following one" (C II, 123). It is important to distinguish Comte's concept of a state of society here from the concept of state as it is used in his multistate laws. The latter, which serve as the terms in the various social series, are not alone causally efficacious in bringing about the succeeding terms. Rather, it is the state of society as a whole which causes the succeeding state of society. The laws of social dynamics "as a whole determine the fundamental march of human development" (ibid.). Although Comte's various laws of social dynamics are to be used together in making predictions, his three-state law of scientific development enjoys a privileged status. He argues that one of the aspects of human social develop- ment must be "spontaneously preponderant" over the others, and that this aspect will "habitually impress upon all the others an indispensable first impetus" (C II, 209). In order to determine which is the preponderant aspect, Comte says, "it suffices to distinguish the social element of which the develop- ment would best be able to be conceived, abstraction being made from that of all the others, in spite of their universal necessary connection; whereas the notion would inevitably reappear, on the contrary, in the direct consideration of the development of these latter" (ibid.). He is trying to say that in order to explain the historical development of any given aspect of society, we will have to make some appeal to premises concerning that of the other aspects. 25. These predictions must also be consistent with the biological laws of "human nature." Using these laws as a check on our sociological predictions, Comte believes, will allow us to avoid mistaking "a continuous decrease for a tendency towards total extinction" (C II, 153). For example, given that contemporary civilized man eats less than primitive man, the use of the historical method alone might tempt one to predict that men will stop eating altogether. Such a result would obviously not be allowed by the laws of biology (ibid.).</page><page sequence="18">A REAPPRAISAL OF COMTE 'S THREE-STATE LAW 265 Our account of one of these aspects, however, will make no such appeal. This aspect will be the "necessary preponderant principle of the whole of the evolution of humanity" (ibid.), and will provide us with a general insight into the whole of human social progress. One could easily take issue with Comte's conclusion that the progress of science is this preponderant aspect, given that he himself believes this development to be conditioned by the division of labor. In his popular work on astronomy he also concedes that the progress of science could not have taken place independently of the technological developments which have given us the equipment we need for our researches.26 A deeper problem with this argument, however, is that it departs from the positivist principle of giving up the search for causes. Comte, I believe, was led astray by the linear classificatory model which he adopts from biology, and which contains an inherent teleology. The use of such linear series in sociology reflects nothing if not the quest for the "origin and destination" of human society. An inquiry into first and final causes invariably leads to a search for chains of efficient causes which will connect the two. A truly posi- tive social science would be content with the discovery of invariable laws governing the "relations of succession and similarity" among social and his- torical phenomena. Such laws would tell us that a certain kind of event is always followed by some other kind of event, or that in similar circumstances we ought to expect similar sorts of things to happen. Knowledge of these kinds of laws would be all that is necessary in order to foresee the effects of our actions, and would thus serve as a sufficient guide for the melioration of human society. V. POPPER'S OBJECTION, AND A REPLY Popper affirms that any statement concerning the succession of three or more events is not properly speaking a law of nature, but merely a trend. It is often possible for these trends to be explained scientifically in terms of universal laws and initial conditions.27 The reason one must be careful not to confuse laws with trends, Popper says, is that in so doing, one tends to overlook the initial conditions on which the trend depends. That is, one takes the statement of a trend to be unconditionally true. On the other hand, "If we succeed in determining the complete or sufficient singular conditions c of a singular trend t, then we can formulate the universal law: 'Whenever there are conditions of the kind c there will be a trend of the kind t.9 9928 Given that we could describe the nature of the human mind in universal terms, and the fact that Comte considers the precise number of sciences in his 26. Auguste Comte, Traite' philosophique d'astronomie populaire (Paris, 1844), 185-186. 27. Popper, 126. 28. Ibid., 129n.</page><page sequence="19">266 WARREN SCHMAUS hierarchy to be somewhat arbitrary, there appears to be no reason that Comte's three-state law could not be expressed in this form. Popper continues, how- ever, to say: "The idea of such a law is unobjectionable from the logical point of view; but it is very different from Comte's and Mill's idea of a law of suc- cession which, like an absolute trend, or a law of mathematical sequence, characterizes the general run of events."29 Popper is unaware of Comte's con- cern with the conditions for historical change because he is laboring under the false belief that, in distinguishing social statics from social dynamics, Comte meant to distinguish the study of societies which do not manifest progress from those which do!30 We have seen, however, that Comte's social statics studies the conditions of social order, which in turn is necessary for progress to take place. Now it is true that Comte holds the belief that local conditions cannot affect the nature of the intellectual development prescribed by the three-state law, but only the rate of development. However, he also makes it abundantly clear that certain conditions, such as the division of labor, must be satisfied before the three-state law can be instantiated in any society. For Popper, the "poverty of historicism" is constituted by the fact that his- toricists "overlook the dependence of trends on initial conditions"31 and accept the statements of historical trends as laws. Judged on the basis of his three- state law of scientific progress alone, taken in abstraction from its relations with his other laws of social dynamics, Comte would not be such an intel- lectually impoverished historicist. It is only when he strays from his positivism, and attributes a kind of causal efficacy to scientific progress which leads him to look for laws of social dynamics describing the social progress which "re- sults" from the scientific, that he may be guilty of this charge. In contrast to Comte, who believes his historical method to rest on a firmer foundation than his three-state law, I believe that his method led him to draw unwarranted inferences from this law. Comte's three-state law of scientific development is, in short, more easily defended than his concept of historical method. Illinois Institute of Technology 29. Idem. Throughout his critique of historicism, Popper identifies Comte's views with Mill's. He probably assumes Mill's discussion of the historical method in the sixth book of the System of Logic to be merely representing the views of Comte, an assump- tion which David Lewisohn has recently shown to be false. See the latter's "Mill and Comte on the Methods of Social Science," Journal of the History of Ideas 33 (1972), 315-324. 30. Popper, 112. 31. Ibid., 128.</page></plain_text>
