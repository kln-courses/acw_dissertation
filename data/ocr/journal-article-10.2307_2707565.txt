<plain_text><page sequence="1">MORRIS R. COHEN IN RETROSPECT BY ERNEST NAGEL The decade that has elapsed since the death of Morris R. Cohen has been crowded with events that have transformed in important ways the world which heard his living voice. During his lifetime he appeared to many of us who knew him personally, or even only through his writings, as a thinker of first-rate importance on the American scene. It is perhaps inevitable that a man's stature should seem less large to succeeding generations than it does to his own contemporaries. Indeed, if frequency of references to him in the current literature is a safe basis for judgment, it must be admitted that few professional philosophers continue to read Cohen or to be influenced by his ideas. However this may be, it still seems to me, looking back across these ten years, that the estimate we then formed of him is not simply the product of a myopic perspective, and that Cohen's conception of philosophy and his contributions to it con- tinue to be of highest value even in this altered world we now inhabit. It is fitting on this occasion to recall the philosophical ideals Cohen represented, and to indicate if only briefly why his memory deserves to be cherished by all who prize the achievements of intellectual ex- cellence. Cohen did not think of philosophy as a discipline competing with the various sciences for obtaining authentic knowledge of the world about us. He did not believe that philosophy yields positive infor- mation about the primary subject-matters of the sciences, or that it possesses special sources of truth which enable it to pass judgment on the factual claims of science and to set bounds to the scope of its methods. As he conceived and practiced it, philosophy is the dis- ciplined critical reflection upon the interpretations men place on the primary materials of their experience-interpretations which are codi- fied in the bodies of knowledge we call the sciences, in the system of rules we designate as morals or positive law, or in the evaluations of art we label as literary and esthetic criticism. Philosophical reflec- tion, as Cohen understood it, seeks to make explicit the logical articulation of claims to knowledge, the grounds of their credibility and validity, and the import of their content for an inclusive view of nature and man. Cohen himself confessed that he never felt quite at home in even the grandest intellectual mansions which philosophers have been constructing for several millenia. He found no evidence whatsoever for the frequently made assumption that the universe is a unitary process, or even a closely knit pattern of different processes, which conforms to the categorial schemata of any of the past or current philosophical systems. He rejected as utterly provincial attempts to 548</page><page sequence="2">MORRIS R. COHEN IN RETROSPECT 549 map the contours of existence in terms of anthropomorphic notions, which pretend to find a likeness to human characteristics in all areas of nature. And while he saw no inevitable progress in the events of human history, he found no cause either for lachrymose agonizing or for romantic postures of defiance, in the fact that the cosmos is not especially arranged for the furtherance of human aims. Cohen was therefore no philosophical system builder in the grand manner. But to my mind he was something much more valuable. He was a man with an almost insatiable intellectual curiosity, highly sensitive to the variety of colored strands with which the web of existence is woven, and possessing an extraordinarily acute critical faculty for exploding the pretentious shams of our society as well as of the intellectual life. He liked to refer to himself as being primarily a logician. But he prepared himself for the function he believed a philosopher should exercise, not only by learning the con- ventional skills of the logician's craft, but also by acquiring unusual mastery over a tremendous range of disciplines and materials. He had a consuming interest in both the natural and the social sciences, in Jogical theory as well as in history, in mathematics and also in law and social philosophy. In consequence, philosophy as practiced by Cohen was a vital human enterprise. He did not permit it to become simply the pursuit of narrowly professionalized technical problems. He was fond of noting the vigor and impressive accomplishments in the history of civilization of so-called "mixed races." Analogously, his own thought was vigorous and stimulating, in considerable meas- ure because he did not fear contamination from exposure to con- crete subject-matters, and because he pursued the task of criticism and clarification without hesitating to cross conventional boundaries between disciplines. He possessed unusual historical erudition, and did much to encourage inquiry into neglected sectors of intellectual history. But he did not think of philosophy as being primarily the custodian of the sacred cows of philosophical schools, whether ancient or modern; and he did not fall victim to the folly of supposing that a historical account of an idea is a substitute for an analysis of the idea's adequacy and truth. In the light of all this, it is perhaps superfluous to add that Cohen prized and extolled the role of reason in the development of civilized life. Reason as he conceived it is not a substantial agent, which generates whatever order there is in the world, but is a type of be- havior manifested by certain organisms. He was fully aware that the rational element does not exhaust the dimensions of human life. But he was fully convinced that it is through the exercise of our capacity to reflect, to trace out the consequences of beliefs, and to test them against the flux of experience, that human life acquires</page><page sequence="3">550 ERNEST NAGEL dignity and nobility. Cohen was not one to jump on band-wagons, whether radical or conservative, and he neither followed nor led the current intellectual fashions. He was true to his ideal of the in- tellectual in society-an ideal which required of the philosopher not that he be a bellwether leading men into what is so often disaster, but that he be a dispassionate critic of established beliefs and in- stitutions who sifts the grain from the chaff. Cohen's temper of mind was thus essentially sceptical, with a deeply ingrained distrust of romantic frenzy and undisciplined en- thusiasm. But his scepticism did not take the form that human reason is inherently incapable of arriving at the truth, and that there- fore some other mode of experience is to be used for penetrating to the nature of things. His scepticism was the scepticism of modern science which recognizes the fallibility of its method for acquiring knowledge, and acknowledges that no claim to possess the truth is beyond the range of further criticism. But though he embodied and sought to spread this sceptical temper, Cohen also maintained that the rational procedure illustrated most clearly and successfully in the modern sciences of nature is the best (because most dependable) method men have yet devised for arriving at responsibly held beliefs. He did not think the use of this method is the panacea for all human ills; for he believed that there are many things in the world beyond human power to remedy, and he had a keen sense for the tragic quality of human existence. But he also believed, surely not with- out good grounds, that much of the cruelty and injustice found among men is the product of behavior which is not informed by a rational analysis of its consequences. Cohen was keenly aware that the life of reason is a difficult and precarious achievement; and he did not hide his fears that the always latent forces of unreason, uneasily dormant under the thin veneer of civilization, could easily be unleashed to destroy the most precious heritage of mankind. His fears were not entirely unjusti- fied by the events; and he lived long enough to witness not only the wide acceptance of philosophies which teach the inferiority of reflec- tive thought to instinct and intuition, but also the bitter practical fruits of such teachings. But throughout his life Cohen was an uncompromising foe of the chthonian deities, in philosophy as in politics. He hated the brutish dogmatism of the unreasoning mind and the authoritarianism that issues from mere power. He disliked intellectual double-talk; and he had an undisguised contempt for thinkers who debase intellectual coinage by employing the language of ancient credos to win assent for ideas foreign to the accepted meanings of the terms used. Cohen was a genuine liberal, in matters intellectual as well as</page><page sequence="4">MORRIS R. COHEN IN RETROSPECT 551 political. He stressed the importance of exploring in a responsible manner untried possibilities, alternative to those realized in actual beliefs and actions; and he accepted as part of his own outlook Justice Holmes's dictum " To have doubted one's own first principles is the mark of a civilized man." But Cohen's liberalism was not a spineless eclecticism, which refuses to take a stand on any issue on the specious ground that since every distinct perspective reveals something not visible in another, no perspective whatsoever can be rightfully adopted. The absolute and total truth is a matter that may be of concern to an Infinite Intelligence; but it was part of Cohen's wisdom to be gladly reconciled to our actual human finitude, and to accept therefore without demurrer the incomplete yet fre- quently adequate character of the knowledge of things we may achieve. Cohen's liberalism was the liberalism of a critical sanity, which was undismayed by the clamors of the market place. He was a knight errant in the cause of human enlightenment, and on behalf of the ideal of beliefs clearly formulated and rationally established. It is an ideal from which men often turn away, but it is also one to which many men frequently return. It is his service to this ideal which keeps Cohen's memory lustrous, and which calls forth our homage to him.* Columbia University. * "An Hour of Commemoration and Song," January 20, 1957, at the Temple Emanuel, New York City.</page></plain_text>
