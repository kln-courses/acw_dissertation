Makhlad and Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Salam al-Khushani, were very much harrassed by fellow Andalusian faqlhs 'for the innovations they had introduced from the East ', (p. 90). Although these ' innovations ' did not go far beyond a keen interest in the newly developed 'ilm al-hadfth, which was not welcome to the conservative Malikite faqlhs, (p. 81), there are indications that it was the clemency of Emir Muhammad which saved Baqis life, and ensured that al-Khushan'Fs imprisonment did not last for more than three days. In the context of the author's quest, four events stand out in the reign of the Emir 'Abdul- lah, (888-912): a seemingly make-believe charge of zandaqa to justify the execution of the Emir's son Mutarrif; the rebellion of the Umayyad prince known as Ibn al-Qitt, declaring himself mahdT, and calling for jihdd, (out of character for an Umayyad); an accusation of zandaqa against Ibn Masarra; and the apostasy of Ibn Hafsin. Ibn Hazm (cf. p. 101 and n. 14), does not mince matters or words when he describes the Emir 'Abdullah both as a fratricide and filicide. The author finds no cause to moderate this judgement and her conclusions give the reader clearer insights into the charge against Mutarrif as a shallow pretext for his execution. But Dr. Fierro takes to task those modern historians who choose 'to see the rebellion of Ibn al-Qitt as a movement of Shiite inspira- tion ', in the absence of historical data to justify such a conclusion, (p. 110 and n.46). The author quite adroitly raises doubts also con- cerning the charge of zandaqa against Ibn Masarra especially when this is claimed to have taken place before his rihla to the East, (towards the end of 'Abdullah's reign), where he would have been more likely to have espoused Mu'tazilite or Qadarite views, (pp. 118 and 136 and also pp. 140-1). Besides, as Dr. Fierro affirms, the Emir 'Abdullah had, in 905, appoin- ted as $ahib al-madina (zalmedina) in Cordova an official 'who publicly professed Mu'tazilite doctrines', (p. 118). The author expresses doubts too concerning the apostasy of Ibn Hafsun in the face of the long-established belief sanctioned by Ibn Hayyan and Ibn Idhari: 'As in the case of the apostasy of Ibn Hafsun, his alliance with the Fatimids is surrounded with obscurity ...' (p. 123). If there are doubts about the charge of zandaqa against Ibn Masarra, there are no doubts that severe decrees were promulgated against his followers by 'Abd al-RahmanIII, and that their actual persecution continued under al-HakamII (chs. 8 and 9, cf. 139). Yet, as the author tells us, it is a cause for wonder that a qaidi like Mundhir b. Sa'id, a Mu'tazilite, and suspected of going along with some of Ibn Masarra's views, performed the duties of qadi al-jama'a in Cordova for 17 years, spanning the reigns of 'Abd al-Rahman III and his son al- Hakam II. Can one simply say that heterodoxy under the Umayyads was another name for political expediency? (cf. 154-6). The author feels that the prosecution of the followers of Ibn Masarra might have been 'a concession to the Malikite faqThs intended to secure their sup- port', (pp. 156 and 174). Did the Umayyads 39 perhaps suspect the followers of Ibn Masarra because the esoteric and ascetic aspects of their doctrines and way of life could afford a favour- able hothouse for Fatimid propaganda? For all the (military) glories of the 'Amirid era, (ch. 10), it comes as a chilling epitaph to the Umayyad caliphate, and particularly when it is inaugurated with the 'purge' of al-Hakam's library-one of the few, very few, 'modern' libraries in the Middle Ages. Books dealing with philosophy, logic, and even astrology were burnt or thrown into wells. Thereby the famous Almanzor 'sought to gain the favour and sup- port of the Malikite faqfhs', (pp. 161-2 and 164-5). Scholars who busied themselves in phil- osophy or doctrinal controversies were subjec- ted to persecution and expulsion from al- Andalus, a policy which continued after Alman- zor's reign, (p. 165). Dr. Fierro's comprehensive treatment of her theme makes this work, as I have already indi- cated, of immense benefit to students of Islamic law. Its benefit to the historian is not less apparent or significant. Just as important, however, is that the student of literature can find profitable guidelines in it. Again and again Dr. Fierro draws our attention to the fact that Islamic Spain always looked to the Arab East for guidance, and for examples of excellence. When the doctors of the law differed in Spain, it was not rare that one of their ranks would suggest that they 'write to the East' to posit or raise a certain case, (pp. 66, 75). The author also speaks of a ' preoccupation' in al-Andalus with 'what the Abbasids will think of us'-' el " que diran " de los 'abbdsies', (n. 26, pp. 83 and 78). But she sums up this relationship in a concise and pointed way where she speaks of al- Andalus as continuing to be, culturally, on tow behind the Arab East,--'... y al-Andalus seguia yendo a remolque culturalmente del Oriente islimico, siendo un pais "receptor" mts que " creador "' (p. 95). Students of literature who persist in trying to trace the Hispano-Arabic muwashshah, written in pure classical Arabic, to a Hispanic or Romance prototype which has not yet come to light, might pause to consider Dr. Fierro's statement. In a work of this nature, where Arabic verses or other quotations are produced in evidence, whether of a legal or historical nature (as e.g. pp. 39, 43, 143), it is important, if not impera- tive, that the original Arabic be produced or transliterated with any given translation, as interpretations or translations could vary con- siderably. The author herself questions a translation by Elias Ter6s, but takes care where this happens to transliterate the original quo- tation, (n. 12, p. 48). Likewise where the text of a fatwa is concerned, she transliterates the Arabic text (p. 121). The transliteration system is clear, and the author has done well to modernize transliterations where she has quoted old texts. The use of hyphens, however, between terms and the pronouns suffixed to them, makes cumbersome reading, (e.g. pp. 111, 121). One or two inaccurate translitera- tions should perhaps be pointed out. For yuzinnu, (pp.49, 51), the context requires the passive yuzannu; qawm min al-daldl, (p. 129), should read qawm min al-dulldl; salb, (p. 62), is clearly a printing mistake for salb.

KING: The historical mosques of Saudi Arabia. 208 pp. London and New York: Longman, 1986. £50. The last forty years have witnessed great advances in the discovery, study and publica- tion of Islamic monuments. Numerous build- ings have been identified in Central Asia and Iran, including the Mausoleum of Arab Ata at Tim and the minaret at Jam in Central Afghanistan, to mention just two of the most outstanding examples. Others have been excavated; for example, the palaces and mosques at Lashkari Bazar and Bust, and the mosques and houses at Siraf in Iran; and major archaeological works in Syria, Turkey, Egypt, North Africa and Spain have also brought to light Islamic monuments. The scarcity of infor- mation from Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the cradle of Islamic architecture, was therefore increasingly felt. Admittedly, the monuments and mosques of the two holy cities, i.e. those of Makka al-Mukarrama and Madina al-Munawwara, had previously been described, discussed and published several times, but little else was known from the rest of the Kingdom. There were, of course, references to mosques and secular buildings in the country by travel- lers like John L. Burckhardt (1829), Sir Richard Burton (1857), William G. Pallgrave (1862-63), H. St. J. Philby and many others. These, however, were mainly travel accounts rather than scholarly studies. It was this obvious lacuna that Geoffrey King sought to remedy while attached as an assistant professor to the University of Riyadh. He travelled extensively throughout the country and carried out system- atic surveys of traditional mosques in the King- dom of Saudi Arabia between 1972 and 1975 and again between the years 1982 and 1985. The results of these surveys were partly published in various articles (cf. BSOAS, XLI, 1978 and XLIII, 1980), but it is this present work which contains a detailed and well-illustrated report of his entire survey on Saudi mosques. The book opens with a brief historical introduction. King mentions that, besides the mosques of Madina and Makka, several others were founded in the Prophet's lifetime or in early Islamic times. These had never been studied or reported. Although most have been rebuilt or altered several times, some still preserve architectural and decorative elements which may be traced back to the very beginning of Islam. At present, it seems, there are only two mosques in the region which date back to early Islamic times, namely, the two excavated at Rabadha. Others reflect local traditions or reveal Egyptian and Ottoman influences. Here one may add that there are also a few which show clearly the influence of Persian traditions. The architectural study is presented in three parts: part I deals with the mosques of western Arabia, part II with those in the Central areas of the Kingdom, while part III describes the mosques in the Eastern Province. Part I begins with a description of the reli- gious monuments in the two holy cities. Refer- ring to both Arabic and Western sources, King outlines the development of the Haram area in Makka. In Madina he mentions the Masjid Quba' which was the first mosque erected after the hijra. In Jidda the most important is the mosque of al-Shafi'i, generally attributed to the caliph 'Umar, but, as the author says, it was most probably built in the time of al-Malik al- Muzaffar, the Rasulid ruler of Yemen, in 649/ 125i. An inscription inside mentions the name of Sharif Husayn b. 'Ajlan, an Amir of Makka between 798/1395 and 829/1426. Strika, however, believed it to be an Ottoman reconstruction. During the present reviewer's visit to Jidda in February and March 1988, the original decoration was visible on the external walls as the white plaster had been removed for restoration work. This revealed typical Mamluk designs which would support King's attribution to al-Malik al-Muzaffar. In the town of Wajh, the Ashraf mosque has an inscription above the doorway which gives its foundation date as 10 Muharram 1306/17 September 1888. There are two blind round- headed arches above the entrance (cf. plate, p. 43). The author compares the decoration to that above the entrance of the BudaywT mosque in Wajh, and adds that the 'tradition of accen- tuating a mosque doorway with blind arches is one of long standing in the Islamic world'. In fact, the tradition began in North Africa and such blind arches recall decorations used in the Maghrib. The mosque has an interesting minaret which is octagonal below, becoming cylindrical above the balcony. King suggests that this type of minaret was introduced from Istanbul in the ninth/fifteenth century. In the mosques of the small towns of al-'Ula and Khaybar there are' fixed' minbars, actually recesses next to the prayer-niche. These are very popular in Saudi Arabia, and must be an indi- genous early feature in mosque architecture. Khaybar has two mosques, one attributed to Abu Talib. Here the recesses of the mihrab and minbar project from the back of the qibla wall. King suggests that the building must be of later date than is believed by the people of Khaybar, but still decidedly early. The extremely interesting and unusual mosque of al-Najdi on the island of Farasan, some distance south on the Red Sea towards Yemen was, according to an inscription, built by Ibrahim al-Najdi al-Tamimi in 1347/1927-8. It was constructed of coral aggregate coated with beige and white plaster. King was informed that the mosque was built by craftsmen from Jidda and Yemen, which may well have been the case, but its ground-plan and decoration reveal a strong Indian influence. The most unusual aspect of the plan is that the sanctuary is preceded by a shallow pavilion with screens on its facade, recalling Indian mosque-architec- ture. King mentions that the founder was a pearl-trader whose travels must have taken him as far as India. It is possible, therefore, that the patron had been impressed by Indo-Muslim architecture, and so chose to adopt this style, perhaps even inviting craftsmen from the sub- continent. 558 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
