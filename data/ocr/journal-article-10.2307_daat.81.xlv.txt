<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ABSTRACTS Ronit Meroz INTER-RELIGIOUS POLEMICS, MESSIANISM AND REVELATION  IN THE SHORT VERSION OF SEFER YEZIRAH This article studies the last paragraph of Sefer Yezirah (§61) according to a  single source – Mss. Parma 2784.14 (De Rossi 1390), the earliest manuscript  containing the short version of this work. The underlying methodological  assumption is that delving into the messages of this text requires a deep  understanding of all of its separate versions. Paragraph 61 of this manuscript  is conspicuously different from the rest of the text. Until this point, the  text deals solely with abstract aspects of cosmology, but in §61, for the first  time, a human being, Abraham, is mentioned, together with his deeds and  achievements. Abraham is described not only as meriting circumcision, but  also as gaining exceptional knowledge: he is able to “gaze” at the upper  worlds and investigate them mathematically. God repays him with great  love: God puts him in his lap, kisses his head and makes him his son; that  is – Abraham undergoes a process of apotheosis that changes his nature  and allows him to dwell in heaven. Moreover, Abraham merits not only  the physical covenant of circumcision but also a spiritual “covenant of the  tongue” – his tongue is “tied” to letters of the alphabet, endowing him with  automatic speech, or glossolalia. With this speech, inspired by the Holy  Spirit, God reveals his secrets to Abraham until he knows all knowledge  and is able to master creation. This article suggests that in the scene in  God’s lap, Abraham’s depiction transforms him into a messianic figure who  replaces Wisdom as God’s partner in the creation of the world. He is joined  later in this partnership by Moses and the Messiah, as is hinted at in Sefer  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   XLV 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="2"> XLVI ABSTRACTS Yetzirah by the enigmatic Hebrew letters – A-M-SH (שמא); A for Abraham,  M for Moses, and Sh for the Messiah. A further suggestion is to read Sefer  Yetzirah as a polemic against Christianity, Judeo-Christianity and possibly  Islam. Contention with Paulinian ideas is very conspicuous, for example in  the special emphasis on the double meaning of the covenant, its physical  aspect alongside its spiritual one, which depends on belief. Even more so is  the role of the beloved son who rises to heaven and enjoys the gift of the  Holy Spirit in the form of glossolalia. Sefer Yetzirah is one of a very few  Jewish texts of the first millennium which engages itself in such controversy,  not by attacking another religion directly, but by proposing a new theology.  This theology has four pillars – the unity of God, the importance of the  physical covenant of circumcision, the turning of Abraham into God’s son,  and the spiritual covenant which is induced by the Holy Spirit. Adam Afterman GLORIFIED WITH EMBROIDERIES OF SONGS: A CHAPTER IN  THE HISTORY OF MYSTICAL PRAYER IN JUDAISM The article follows an ancient tradition that correlates the Divine appearing  in different garments with human theurgy and prayer. A key chapter  in both the anthropomorphic and theurgical Jewish traditions finds its  expression in different sources spanning the Hebrew Bible, Qumran texts,  Hekhalot mystic writings, Midrashim, liturgical poems and Ashkenazi  sources. All articulate the connection between the different appearances of  God, His garments and human theurgy. In medieval Ashkenazi sources we  find a clear link between the prayer of Israel and God’s different clothes  and garments, specially His crown and phylacteries, which are used on  different occasions to directly link with the state of the collective of Israel  and its prayer. The different garments, their position, luminance, colors and  size all indicate the level of intimacy reached between the “assembly of  Israel” and God. These ideas are yet further developed in early kabbalah  and in the Zohar, where the erotic dynamics between the “assembly of  Israel” and God are now represented in a complex interplay of mutual  crowning and mutual dressing and undressing, as manifestations of Jewish  theurgy, prayer and Torah study. דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   XLVI 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="3"> ABSTRACTS XLVII Israel Ben-simon SERMONS ON THE TORAH: R. JACOB ANATOLI AND HIS  INFLUENCE ON R. JOSHUA IBN SHU’EIB’S SERMONS Melamed Hatalmidim, Jacob Anatoli, substantially affected many philosophers  in Provence and Italy during the 13th and 14th centuries. Philosophers such  as Levi Ben Avraham, Menachem ha-Meiri and Immanuel of Rome were  considerably affected by Anatoli’s composition. In this article I discuss the  influence of R. Jacob Anatoli on R. Joshua Ibn Shu’eib as expressed in the  latter’s Derashot ‘al Hatorah. I claim that these sermons are largely based on  Jacob Anatoli’s interpretations in his Melamed Hatalmidim. R. Joshua Ibn Shu’eib rarely quotes his sources, but in five instances he  does so, and the source is Melamed Hatalmidim. This shows Anatoli’s impact  even across the border from Provence and Italy, and even on philosophers  who were not members of the Philosophical Society. R. Jacob Anatoli’s  impact on R. Joshua Ibn Shu’eib appears both structure and content, and  his apparent target audience seems similar as well. Both rabbis strive to  make their content more accessible to the public and their essays more  available to a wider range of readers. Anatoli aimed to share the Torah’s  philosophical interpretations, while R. Joshua Ibn Shu’eib did the same  with the Kabbalah. A comparison of R Joshua Ibn Shu’eib writings with  Anatoli’s Melamed Hatalmidim shows how Shu’eib used his mentors writings,  sometimes by elaborating on them and sometimes by simply copying them.  Roee Goldschmidt “IS THERE A TREE WITHIN OR NOT?”: A ZOHARIC PASSAGE BY R. MENAHEM RECANATI Rabbi Menahem Recanati and his literary corpus are considered among  the most important sources for understanding the formation of the Zohar.  Recent scholarship has noted Recanati’s influence upon various Kabbalists  active in the generations after the Zohar, such as R. Joseph Gikallia, and  even upon those who wrote parts of the Zohar, such as the anonymous  author of the Tikkunim and Ra’ya Mehemna. The fact that Recanati quotes  from the Zohar as it lay before him, Midrash ha-Ne’elam and the Idra  Rabba, makes his writings a valuable witness to the text of the Zohar and  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   XLVII 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="4"> XLVIII ABSTRACTS a window for understanding the ways in which the work was redacted. In  the present article I seek to demonstrate that a Kabbalistic passage was  written by Kabbalists who had studied Recanati’s words and then proceeded  to compose a Zoharic passage based upon them. This passage, which appears  in Parashat Shelah, was redacted and inserted into the Zohar amidst a  section that deals with an entirely different subject. I give a number of  reasons to support my claim that Recanati was the source of this Zoharic  passage, and not the reverse, as is often the case. One of the reasons is the  way in which the passage relates to the biblical story of the Jewish people  in Rephidim. Here we find a disagreement amongst the Kabbalists, and it  seems that the author of the Zohar in Shelah endorses Recanati’s unique  interpretation. I also provide additional philological case studies that confirm  the connection between Recanati’s interpretation and that of the Zoharic  passage, in addition to structural and conceptual affinities. The integration of  Recanati’s writings into the Zohar itself has been overlooked by scholarship.  This example has much to teach us about the ways in which Kabbalists of  the fourteenth century and beyond were influenced by the writings of their  predecessors, employing the language and literary conventions of Zoharic  interpretation. Ariel Malachi ON THE SOUL BY IBN SINA:  A REMARK ON THE HEBREW TRANSLATION AND ITS  IMPLICATION FOR YEHUDA HALEVI In the last chapter of Kuzari, Yehuda Halevi includes an adaptation and  integration of Ibn Sina’s On the Soul. In his Hebrew translation of Ibn  Sina’s original text, the late Prof. Michael Schwartz commented on a  difficult paragraph laden with logical and epistemological terms, mentioning  that Halevi chose to omit most of those epistemological terms. This article  seeks to clarify this paragraph in light of logical and epistemological aspects  of Ibn Sina’s thought and their Greek and Arabic sources. This article  also tries to suggest an explanation for Halevi’s apparently intentional  omission of all but one of the epistemological terms in the paragraph.  In this respect, the main argument is that in Kuzari, Halevi purposely  varies his arguments with different epistemological qualities. While offering  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   XLVIII 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="5"> ABSTRACTS XLIX diverse qualities in his arguments for the educated reader, Halevi designs  those same arguments to be strong and convincing to the layman. In this  way, Halevi addresses two kinds of readers simultaneously, guiding each of  them to different understandings and conclusions by means of the same  text and arguments. Jair Haas R. ABRAHAM IBN EZRA AND THE NEO-PLATONIC WORLD- SOUL: THE IDENTITY OF ‘HAY’ IN ‘HAY BEN MEQITZ’ R. Abraham ibn Ezra’s epistle ‘Hay ben Meqitz’ is an allegory for the path  Man’s eternal soul must take in order to cling to the spiritual worlds. In  the epistle this path is likened to a physical journey undertaken by an  anonymous traveler and his guide, “Hay ben Meqitz.” They embark from the  sub-lunar world, traverse the world of the stars and celestial spheres, and  end in the upper spiritual world. While scholars agree that the anonymous  traveler represents the soul, they widely disagree concerning the identity of  “Hay ben Mekitz” – is he Elijah, an archetypical philosopher or perhaps the  Active Intellect? The present study analyzes the descriptions of “Hay ben  Mekitz” found in the epistle in light of ibn Ezra’s other writings. It reaches  the conclusion that the guide represents the neo-platonic world-soul. The  world-soul is the source of all individual souls and is their ultimate unity.  The soul’s path to cling to the spiritual worlds is thus attained by attaching  itself to its own real “self.” Dov Schwartz THE PASSION FOR METAPHYSICS IN  MAIMONIDES’ PHILOSOPHY This article analyzes the Guide 1, chapters 31-35, which discusses the  obstacles that stand in the way of the student of metaphysics. The most  dangerous obstacle of all is the passion for attaining metaphysical knowledge,  that is an impulse for attaining general knowledge. This passion can be  understood properly by comparing it to sexual desire.

Now a political capacity is needed to rule and to regulate this passion.  Maimonides tendentiously treated Talmudic mysticism in order to emphasize  the dangerous side of the passion for metaphysics. Elaborating this issue  reveals Maimonidean rationalism.   Shalom Sadik FREE WILL IN THE THOUGHT OF RABBI ABRAHAM BIBAGO Rabbi Abraham Bibago (died c. 1489) was a prominent thinker in the last  generation of a thriving Jewish community in Spain. In his central book,  Derech Emuna (“Way of Belief ”), Bibago aimed for a synthesis between  moderate philosophical views and traditional Jewish belief. This article  describes the position of R. Bibago on free will. The first part of the article  analyzes R. Bibago’s understanding of the psychological process of choice.  According to R. Bibago, freedom of will characterizes humans as opposed to  animals and divine beings (such as angels). These latter have only corporal  (animals) or intellectual (divine beings) capacities, while humans have  both. Using free will, people can choose whether to follow their corporal  or intellectual inclinations. The second part of the article describes the  differences R. Bibago finds between the workings of human free will and  animal will. Due to the intellectual part of the human soul, people’s fates  are not predetermined by the stars. The third part of the article analyzes  R. Bibago’s interpretation of the heresy of Elisha ben Abuya. According to  Bibago, akrasia exists and people not only can act against their intellectual  knowledge but also can change their opinions at will.  Eli Gur f inkel THE UNIQUENESS OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AS A PRINCIPLE  OF FAITH The theme of the chosenness and uniqueness of the Jewish people  has wielded considerable influence on Jewish history, and occupies an  important place in the history of religious ideas in the Abrahamic faiths.  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   L 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="7"> ABSTRACTS LI Consequently, its omission from the Maimonidean principles of faith  has aroused extensive discussion, and various aspects of this question  were examined over the course of time: some thinkers maintain that  the omission of this principle teaches of its negation, while others took  pains to show its inclusion in the list, or to argue that its omission was  due to other reasons. In several post-Maimonidean lists this notion was  added as an independent principle, or was explicitly mentioned as part  of one of the other listed principles. The current research will survey  the history of this discussion, shed light on a chapter in the history of  the interpretation of Maimonidean thought, and examine the place of  this controversial theological principle within the context of the listing  of the principles in Maimonidean thought and in that of other classical  Jewish thinkers. Ohana Michal “THROUGH WHAT DO WOMEN EARN MERIT?”  WOMEN’S ULTIMATE PERFECTION AND THEIR REWARD  IN THE WORLD-TO-COME, IN THE THOUGHT OF RABBI  YIZHAK ZARFATI Rabbi Yizhak Zarfati II (1611- 1661) served as Rabbi in the city of Fez,  Morocco, and delivered sermons to his congregation on various occasions.  In this article, I will analyze his theory of women’s ultimate end, and  their reward in the world-to-come, based upon eulogies that he delivered  for various women of his time. Zarfati suggested four possible means for  women to attain both perfection and reward. Apparently these means do not  apply solely to women, but to anyone who does not study Torah. Indeed,  an examination of eulogies delivered by Zarfati for men reveals that he  applied the same criteria to individuals who were not Torah scholars, and  suggested that they too attain both perfection and eternal reward based  upon these alternative means.  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   LI 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="8"> LII ABSTRACTS Avinoam Bier  “THE JOURNEY AT THE DESTINATION” THE CHARACTER  OF MYSTICAL PRACTICE IN THE THOUHT OF THE MAGGID  OF MEZRITCH The purpose of this research is to investigate the character of mystical  practice in the thought of the Maggid. The intention of this article is  to reveal an additional aspect of his thought on this practice, namely its  circular nature. Mystical practice is commonly thought to contain defined  points – a beginning, a climax and an ending, whereas in the circular  concept the beginning and end coincide. This article claims that according  to the Maggid, the division of the practice into discrete stages exists only  in human consciousness, whereas from the perspective of divinity, the  human mystic, in his ascent as in his descent, is on a constant level – that  of sojourning in the divine presence. Additionally, this article claims that  the constant sojourn in the divine presence, which is a derivative of the  circular mystical practice, is fundamentally identical to the nature of reality  as it appears in the Maggid’s writings. Reality according to the Maggid  consists of opposing entities which coexist due to the Ayin, or “nothingness”  between them. The identity between mystical practice and the dialectical  nature of reality is what enables the work of the Tzaddik, turning existence  into non-existence. Tsiri Levanoni WHERE DOES THE SOUL RETURN TO BY REPENTANCE? Repentance (teshuva) is a major concept in the thought of Habad›s Rebbes.  Repentance is defined as the return (the literal meaning of the word teshuva)  of the soul to its supernal source. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the  founder of Habad Chassidism, and his son, the Mitteler Rebbe, Rabbi  Dov Ber Shneuri of Lubavitch, explain that repentance raises the soul  even beyond its original source in God. In Rabbi Dov Ber’s expositions,  the essence of Divinity appears as a source of the soul. Thus, repentance  reaches beyond the essence of Divinity! Rabbi Shneur Zalman and Rabbi  Dov Ber see the point to which the soul must return as being the essence  of the Infinite Light of God. This is greater than the experience of the  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   LII 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="9"> ABSTRACTS LIII soul in the “World to Come” (the “Garden of Eden”), where it enjoys a  limited degree of the Light of God, measured according to the spiritual  level and virtue of its actions that it attained in this world. In contrast,  through repentance and performance of God’s commandments (mitzvot) in  this world, the soul is drawn at once into God’s very essence. This occurs  instantaneously, without any progression of stages. In this connection, Rabbi  Shneur Zalman and Rabbi Dov Ber analyze the power of repentance.  They note that repentance reaches greater theosophical depths than does  the performance of God’s commandments. It can therefore successfully fill  the spiritual void caused by having missed opportunities to perform the  commandments. However, both repentance and mitzvot reach the essence of  God, so how can repentance exceed the mitzvot? Rabbi Dov Ber explains  that the performance of God’s commandments reaches God’s essence by  first “donning” the havya letters of God’s name, whereas repentance reaches  God’s essence directly. Moreover, although performing the commandments  indeed reaches God’s essence, repentance reaches “the depth of the depth  of God’s essence,” which performing the commandments cannot reach. Elie Holzer THE SFAT EMET’S HOMILIES IN THE LIGHT OF PAUL  RICOEUR’S ‘WORK OF THE TEXT’ This article examines the literary genre of the written Hasidic homilies of  Rabbi Aryeh Leib Alter (1848-1905), known as Sfat Emet. The discussion  is conducted through the lens of Paul Ricoeur’s concept of “the work of the  text.” This concept encompasses the elements of composition and codification  of the text as well as the desired effects of the reading process. The analysis  identifies the features that are at work in the homilies, along with the  type of hermeneutic activity into which the reader is drawn. This activity  is designed to cause the reader to become open, in new or renewed ways,  toward various dimensions of reality. The article suggests that the Hasidic  homily is designed to act upon the reader in and through the very reading  process: what the reader learns is not confined to the content of the homily  but is first and foremost due to the nature of the reading experience itself.  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   LIII 06/07/2016   12:11:07 </page> <page sequence="10"> LIV ABSTRACTS Eli Schonfeld “FORSAKEN GOD”: MOSES MENDELSSOHN AND RABBI JACOB  EMDEN ON CHOSENNESS AND UNIVERSALISM This article revisits the dispute between Moses Mendelssohn and Rabbi  Jacob Emden on the question of Jewish chosenness and Universalism, based  on a renewed analysis of their correspondence concerning Maimonides’  synthesis of the Noachide laws. Whereas Mendelssohn advocates for a  universalism of Reason, Emden develops a surprising idea of universalism  as mediated by divine commandment. This article proposes to uncover the  philosophical layers beneath the Mendelssohn-Emden debate and highlights  the theoretical originality of Emden’s idea of Jewish universality, often  regarded as dogmatic and pre-modern in comparison to Mendelssohn’s  enlightened thinking. More importantly, this paper demonstrates how, had  Mendelssohn accepted Emden’s doctrine of universalism, he could have  found a solution to one of the most important problems he struggles with  in his book Jerusalem, i.e., the contradiction between universalism and  chosenness.  Yossi  Turner NATIONAL INDIVIDUALITY, UNIVERSAL HUMANITY AND SOCIAL  JUSTICE IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF AARON DAVID GORDON This paper discusses the thinking of the 2nd Aliya pioneer-philosopher,  Aaron David Gordon, on justice, national individuality and universal  humanity. As opposed to the existing literature which either considers  these topics individually or limits itself to their discussion in general terms,  the present paper exposes the deep philosophical consistency that makes  these topics inter-dependent in Gordon’s thinking. The paper adopts the  claim already present in the literature on Gordon’s thought, according  to which his concept of “man in nature” constitutes the philosophical  starting point of the many different topics developed in his writings. More  specifically, the article demonstrates that as in other areas of his thought,  Gordon places the creative power of life in nature at the center of his  thinking on individual nationality, universal humanity and social justice.  The basis for this claim is established through an investigation of the role  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   LIV 06/07/2016   12:11:06 </page> <page sequence="11"> ABSTRACTS LV played by the power of life in the ethical urge that Gordon ascribes to  creation, in his critique of modern society, in his understanding of the  interaction of the moral sensibility and the religious spiritual heritage in  the formation of a people, as well as in the ideas he set forth for the  formation of a workers’ community and his thinking concerning the desired  relations with the Arab residents of the Land of Israel. It is demonstrated,  toward the end of the paper, that as result of his focus on the power  of life in the ethical and religious aspects of national existence, Gordon  paradoxically understood national individuality to be a necessary condition  for the existence of a universal humanity and the realization of morality  and justice in the world.  Ronny Miron THE POET OF REALITY A CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON BARUCH KURZWEIL’S  HERMENEUTICS VIS-À-VIS MARTIN HEIDEGGER’S IDEA OF  A WORK OF ART The common distinction in modern philosophy between approaches that  are anchored in mundane reality and those that are addressed to the  transcendent is put to a radical test in Baruch Kurzweil’s hermeneutics, at  the center of which the Hebrew author and poet represent the alternative  to the traditional Jewish scholar. This article develops the relationship  between Kurzweil’s understanding of the mundane and transcendent realities  expressed in modern Hebrew literature and his interpretation of the ways  in which the meaning-creating reader responds to them. Relying on the  affinities between Kurzweil’s hermeneutics and Martin Heidegger’s idea  of man (Dasein) and art, the central argument in the article is that the  dominance of the artist in regard to his work of art does not diminish his  metaphysical position as “a poet of reality.” Quite the opposite, the modern  author and poet in Kurzweil’s thinking transpires as having a special access  to mundane and transcendent realities that enable him to give them voice,  even in works of art that declare their unreserved secularity.  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   LV 06/07/2016   12:11:06 </page> <page sequence="12"> LVI ABSTRACTS Yaron Silverstein BETWEEN THE HEROISM OF SAUL AND THE FIGHTERS OF  THE GHETTO: THE MYTH OF MASADA IN THE THOUGHT OF  RABBI SHLOMO GOREN AND RABBI MOSHE-ZVI NERIA The story of the last battle at Masada, the end of the Great Revolt against  the Romans which took place in the years 66-73 AD, has occupied a central  and important place in the world-view of various factions within the Zionist  movement since the 1920s. The story was long used as a formative myth to  bolster the characteristics of physical courage and strength among the Jewish  people, out of a deep desire to fashion a model of a “new Jew.” The main  characteristics of this “new Jew” were the priority of power and physical  strength in the scale of values,  and the forging of an identity associated  with a defined place – the land of Israel. The construction of the myth  around Masada was accomplished primarily through glorifying the heroism  of its historic fighters, combined with trips to forge an acquaintance with  the striking, heroically oriented topographical aspects of the mountain.  Throughout its history, religious Zionism has perceived itself as a natural  partner in the Zionist movement and in the vision of the restoration of  Jews to their homeland. However, the combination of Zionist values  with  religious values has persistently raised questions for religious Zionists about  the proper balance between them . In the case of the myth of Masada, its  persistent use in Israel caused Rav Goren to deal with the element of suicide  in the Masada myth, while his article on that subject brought Rav Neria  to publish a counter-statement. In his treatment, Rav Goren considered  foremost the soldiers of the IDF. He saw in the actions of Jews on Masada  a continuation of the heroism of King Saul, meaning an approach both  legitimate and of value. As such, he advocated that it be continued and  applied to the actions of Israeli soldiers bearing responsibility for renewed  sovereignty over the land of Israel. It can be assumed that Rav Goren was  also cognizant of the act of Uri Ilan in the Syrian prison. Rav Neria, in  contrast, had in mind in this discussion the citizens of the state. He saw in  the actions of the people of Masada a precursor of some, but not all, of the  types of Jewish heroism that occurred during the Holocaust. Thus, in his  opinion, Jewish heroism need not be characterized by an uncompromising  fight to the death against a powerful enemy. Rather, heroism, in his eyes,  can be expressed in the ability to tolerate subjugation or degradation while  דעת 81 - אנגלית.indd   LVI 06/07/2016   12:11:06 </page> <page sequence="13"> ABSTRACTS LVII maintaining the commandments of Judaism.
