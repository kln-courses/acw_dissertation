<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavations at Mudayna During last year's regional survey, a com- plete female figurine and fragments of anthropomorphic vessels were found at a site (13) south of er-Rumeil. A salvage exca- vation was conducted here earlier in the summer. The excavation produced several other figurines and more fragments of anthro- pomorphic vessels. Most of the figurines were ceramic representations of women holding a disc or grabbing their breasts. Some more exotic finds included murex and cowrie shells, miniature juglet used for per- fume (or incense?), a limestone figurine head, and a blue faience pharaoh amulet. The faience amulet together with the hairstyle and dress of some of the figurines suggest a stronger Egyptian influence here than in neighboring Judah. The collection of finds should help us understand better the reli- gion and culture of the Iron Age people from this region. The complete architecture of Site 13 is still unclear, but the finds and the position of the site suggest that it was an Iron Age II cul- tic place. The site had been looted, but most of the objects found this season emerged from under a layer of cobblestones in what appears to be afavissa (cultic repository). The regional survey, suerpvised by J. A. Dearman, recorded an additional fifteen sites, bringing the total number of recorded sites to thirty-three. Most of these sites belonged to one of the two periods also attested at Mudayna: Iron Age II or Nabataean. The Iron Age settlements were usually watch towers or agricultural installations. The abun- dance of strategically located Iron Age II towers adds to the suggestion that this area was at the border between Moab and Ammon. The Nabataean sites were mostly farming settlements located across the wadis over- looking the agricultural land. Some of the sites boast numerous buildings and other features. For example, er-Rumeil included no less than thirty-three cisterns. Only one site with earlier material has been located. Daviau and Abu Shmeis, rep- resentative for the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, collected a sample of Chalcolithic- Early Bronze Age lithics at a site occupying a terrace on the south side of Wadi ath- Thamad. Further exploration is planned for future seasons. P. M. Michele Daviau Wilfrid Laurier University</page></plain_text>
