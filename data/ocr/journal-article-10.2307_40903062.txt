Le but est d'analyser les conséquences de la distinction cartésienne entre des notions primitives différentes et incompa- rables, et des différents genres de connaître qui s'en suivent, conséquences qui à cause de l'influence de la version Ryleienne du dualisme cartésien sont restées largement ignorées dans les débats anglo-américains récents. This paper examines Descartes's view of man and the understanding involved in the notion of the mind-body union. The aim is to spell out the implications of Descartes's distinction between different and incomparable primary notion and related kinds of knowledge, which due to the misleading but influential Rylean version of Descartes's mind-body dualism have remained largely unnoticed in the contemporary Anglo-American debate. 1. The view of man which is usually associated with « Cartesian Dualism » in modern discussions is that of an immaterial soul or mind working « inside » an extended material body functioning according to the mechanical laws of nature. Ryle, in The Concept of Mind (1949), labelled it the myth or the dogma of the « Ghost in the Machine ». The true man, in this analogy, is neither identified with the human body nor with the composite of body and mind but with the mind alone. The human body is but a machine that the rational mind can manipulate in mysterious ways, and which is also supposed to influence, mysteriously, the workings of the mind l. 1.

It could be called the « Myth of the Cartesian Myth ». This is not to say that the myth Ryle is fighting against is a sheer construction. On the contrary, it has been a very influential and powerful dogma which still haunts philosophers of mind in the form of « homunculus » sind other theories. But it is misleading to call it a « Cartesian » myth. As many scholars have noticed and shown, Des- cartes's dualistic conception of man is closer to the Aristotelian than to the Platonist view and should therefore be distinguished from a crude « Ghost-in-the-Machine » dualism 2. But if the differences between « Cartesian dualism » and Descartes's dualism have been recognized, the epistemological and methodological implications of Descartes's views have not received the attention they deserve. Descartes's mind-body distinction does not, I want to argue, commit him to any of the 2. Descartes's use of Aristotelian terms and formulas in accounting for the mind- body union is wellknown and amply documented in the works of French scholars. For discussions and different interpretations of the view this terminology borrowed from a philosophy he rejects covers in Descartes see, e.g., Etienne Gilson, Commen- tary to Descartes, Discours de la méthode, Paris, Vrin, 1925 (1967), p. 431 ff.; Gilson, Etude sur le rôle de la pensée médiévale dans la formation du système cartésien, Paris, Vrin, 1930 (1975), p. 245 ff.; O.

Baier, "Cartesian Persons", Philosophia 10, n°3-4, 1981, p. 169-188, reprinted in Postures of the Mind, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1985, p. 74-92. See also, e.g., Robert C.

But see also Margaret Wilson (1978) who seems to follow Ryle and Strawson in interpreting Descartes's view of man as a strict and "robust" dualism and in insisting on the incoherence of this view. Although Wilson notes the exaggerations of Ryle's charges against Cartesian dualism and even thinks Strawson's arguments against Descartes can be challenged, she still considers their criticism fundamentally to the point. Interestingly, Wilson is aware that Descartes might have responded to the charges they raise by talking of the mind-body union as a third thing, but does not discuss this possibility. Wilson feels, incorrectly I believe, that Descartes "should have stuck to his guns", i.e., presumably, to the two-subject dualism to which Wilson thinks he is committed.

The aim of this paper is to bring out some interesting implications of the Cartesian notions of the mind and the mind-body union that Descartes himself recognized but which because of the influential « Cartesian myth » have been largely ignored in the modern discussion. I shall begin by recalling the main tenets of the current version of Cartesian dualism, and then try to show why I find it misleading as an account of Descartes's views. There are, I want to show, three different views or perspectives on man to be distingushed in Descartes's writings, each of which is related to very different methodological and epis- temological concerns. It is the last of these views, which represents Descartes's mature thinking on the subject that interests me here, namely the conception of man as a real union between the mind and the body. I shall discuss some of the difficulties involved in this notion and Descartes's attempt to avoid them by a distinction between different kinds of knowledge. I shall end by drawing some parallels between what Descartes says of our understanding of this notion and recent accounts, inspired by Wittgenstein, of our understanding of human beings and our use of mental terms. 2. Ryle's charges against Cartesian dualism are well known: it involves a radical category-mistake based on a false para-mechanical hypothesis. Descartes and his followers mistakenly conceived the mind as a thing, though of a different sort than the body. Mental processes were, analogously, conceived as causes and effects, but different from the mechanical causes and effects in terms of which the actions of bodies could be explained3. The natural methodological counterpart of this dogma is the theory that the ways of discovering and knowing one's mind and its contents are analogous to the ways of knowing physical things, albeit different from these : the latter are based on outer bodily sense-perception which is intersubjective and testable - the former is based on non-sensuous « inner » perception generally called « intros- pection » 4. The metaphorical talk of « inner » and « outer » is connected with the view that the mind has privileged epistemic access to its own states. The contents of consciousness are perceived directly, they are, as it were « phosphorescent », and, moreover, private (non-accessible to other observers). The knowledge of the states and workings of one's own mind (« present thinkings, feelings, willings perceivings, rememberings, 3. Rylel9ff. 4. Ryle 154. 393</page><page sequence="4">Ulli Alanen imaginings ») is therefore in a sense superior to the knowledge of « outer » things (bodies and « other minds »). Unlike the « outer » sense-perceptions, consciousness and introspection cannot be mistaken and confused5. The somewhat weird consequence of Descartes's dualism, in this interpretation, is that statements describing mental states and events, although unverifiable because of their « private » and « hidden » nature, have a certainty superior to statements concerning outer objects, the truth of which can be tested by intersubjective, scientific methods6. Descartes, clearly, made use of metaphors very similar to the « Ghost-in-the-Machine »-analogy in his early writings on man. Thus, in giving his first crude accounts of the interaction between the rational soul and the body, he compares the body to a mechanically working statue of earth, the movements of which are controlled and regulated by the immaterial soul. In his later works he elaborates on this « para-mechanical » metaphor when giving a more detailed explanation of the mind-body interaction through the movements of the pineal gland and the animal spirits 7. But it is important to realize that those are and remain metaphors for Descartes - mechanical accounts of something which as Descartes clearly saw and recognized at a later stage, could not in fact be adequately represented or described by means of any mechanical or para-mechanical model. In 1648, Descartes writes to Arnauld: That the mind, which is incorporeal, can set the body in motion - this is something which is shown to us not by any reasoning or comparison with other matters, but by the surest and plainest everyday experience. It is one of those self-evident things which we only make obscure when we try to explain them in terms of others 8. 5.

Descartes's view of man, as noted above, has actually more in common with Aristotelian-Thomistic dualism than with Platonistic views. The union of the mind and the body is conceived by Descartes as a real and substantial union, on the model of the Aristotelian notion of an individual substance composed of form and matter9. But this traditional notion of an immaterial form inhering and working in a material body is notoriously problematic and obscure. Transposed into the framework of Descartes's radical dualism and mechanistic philo- sophy of nature it appears totally unintelligible 10. When faced with this difficulty (raised, notably, by Elizabeth and Gassendi)11, Descartes invariably replied that the union of the mind and the body cannot in fact be understood or explained by more clear and distinct ideas, but that it need not be explained at all. The notion we have of this union, according to Descartes, is a « primitive notion », and as such it should be plain to everyone. For it is the notion we have of ourselves as conscious agents, which is familiar from our daily experience and action 12. 3. Before discussing this answer, I will try to sketch out, briefly, the three different perspectives from which Descartes, at different stages of his development, deals with questions relating to our understanding of human nature. Descartes, as is well known, was a mathematician and 9.

See also the literature quoted in note 2 above. The similarities between the Cartesian and the Aristotelian view of man are ignored by those anti-dualist who like to contrast what they consider a true "Aristotelian view" of man to the "Platonistic-Cartesian" view that Descartes, allegedly, held and which, in so far as it seems easier to accommodate to a materialist or functionalist theory of man is also considered more respectable than the latter.

The difficulty, as Spinoza puts it in a famous remark, is to understand how a philosopher who would "affirm nothing which he did not clearly and distinctly perceive, and who so often had taken to task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, besides which occult qualities are commonplace. What does he understand, I ask, by the union of the mind and the body? What clear and distinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union with a certain particle of extended matter?"

His first philosophical concerns were with scientific methodology and the application of what he considered his new method to the sciences of nature. The part of Descartes's first (unpublished) Treatise on Man which has been saved is a treatise in mechanistic physiology. The human body is there considered as a piece of mechanically moved matter, all the functions of which can be explained according to the same principles used in the explanation of other events in the physical universe. Since the treatise is incomplete, we do not know how Descartes thought he could account for the union - which he seems to take for granted - between the mechanically working body and the rational soul, at this stage. The sparse hints he gives tend towards occasionalism : God is said to have given the soul its main seat in the brain and made it of such a nature that it will have different sensations according to the various ways in which the brain is affected by the movements of the nerves 13. Descartes gives more detailed explanations of the mind-body inter* action in his later writings. I will not discuss these explanations or the notorious difficulties they raise 14. But I want to stress that the interest which moved Descartes in developing his problematic theory of the pineal gland and the animal spirits was primarily that of a philosopher of nature (a physicist). The philosophical problems it raised simply had not occurred to Descartes yet : he seems not to have become aware of them until a much later stage, partly as a consequence of the insistent questions of Elizabeth and other contemporaries. When Descartes, occasionally, mentions the soul or the mind in his earlier writings, he always refers to it in traditional terms. Descartes's main concern, in his later, philosophical work, is with the foundations of knowledge. The human mind is here viewed primarily as an epistemic subject : the focus is on its epistemic capacities and the conditions of secure knowledge. It is in this context that Descartes develops his notion of the mind or the self as an essentially thinking thing, the nature of which is radically different and distinct from that of the extended body. This notion represents what is here considered Descartes's second view or perspective on human nature. As Descartes insists in both the Discourse and the Meditations, the true man, however, is not a purely thinking thing or mind, but a mind closely united to or « intermingled » with a body. This notion of man as a real, or as Descartes also describes it, « substantial » union of the mind and the 13. AT XL 119-120,143. 14. For textual references see note 7 above.

Richardsson, "The 'Scandal' of Cartesian Interactionism", Mind (1982): 20-37. 396</page><page sequence="7">Descartes's dualism body, represents Descartes's mature view of man as a conscious and embodied agent. It is a primitive, irreducible notion, covering important features of human experience and action such as sensations, passions and voluntary movements which are not fully intelligible in terms of the notions of extension or thought alone. Viewed from this perspective, man is neither a merely physical nor a purely spiritual being but a third kind of being, with its own distinctive moral nature and experience. This notion of the real or true man, to which Descartes had not paid much attention before the Meditations, can, as he eventually saw and insisted in his correspondence with Elizabeth, be understood only through itself 15. 4. Can this answer be taken seriously ? The mind and the body, as Descartes defines these notions, can be clearly and distinctly conceived only as distinct, when considered separately from each other. But then they cannot without absurdity also be conceived as united, for this would be to conceive them at the same time as two different and one single thing, which, as Descartes admits, is impossible 16. Although he recognized the difficulty, Descartes did not give up the notion of a real union between the mind and the body, the natures of which are intelligible only when conceived separately from each other. But he drew a distinction between different kinds of knowledge, and insisted that this union belongs to a third primitive notion. The mind-body union, he held, cannot be clearly and distinctly perceived by the pure understanding or the intellect alone, but it is nevertheless clearly perceived by the senses and in daily experience. To bring out the import of this distinction, something has to be said of Descartes's scientific reform. We all know, from The Discourse on the Method and Descartes's other programmatic declarations that its general aim was to gain clarity and distinctness where the scholastics had 15. For references, see sections 7 and 8 below. 16. AT III, 693, Κ 142. The real scandal of Cartesian mind-body dualism, if there is one, is this problem of the conceivability of the union, and not, as Richardsson (1982) has shown, that of the interaction between the mind and the body. Cf. section 9 below, especially note 57. But see also Gouhier who argues that the real problem for Des- cartes is not to conceive the mind-body union, which is an immediate given of experience, but to conceive the real distinction between mind and body. (Gouhier, 1962, Chapt. XII). However, having produced, as he thinks, a conclusive proof of a real distinction between mind and body, Descartes certainly could not rely on the scholastic doctrine of their substantial union as a solution to the problem of his critics. I find it quite implausible that Descartes would not, as Gouhier suggests, have seen their difficulty at all. (Gouhier, 1962, 326-328; 364 ff.) On the contrary, as the quote referred to above testifies, Descartes admits that conceiving the mind and the body as distinct and at the same time as really united (i.e., one thing) is a logical impossibility. 397</page><page sequence="8">Lüli Alanen achieved nothing but obscurity and confusion. What Descartes opposes, in particular, is the anthropomorphism of the traditional Aristotelian science of nature and the illegitimate use of notions derived from our every day experience and common sense psychology in the explanation of physical events. The paradigm of such notions is that of an immaterial form or « substantial quality », e.g., heaviness, which is supposed to inhere and work in a physical body and thereby to explain its (natural) motions. Such notions are modeled on our own experience as conscious agents pursuing certain ends. Although we understand such notions clearly enough in attributing them to ourselves or to human beings generally, they become occult and unintelligible when extended to the description of changes in physical nature. To meet Descartes's require- ments of clarity and distinctness, scientific explanations should be in strictly mechanistic and mathematical terms. Qualitative notions cannot be translated into quantitative concepts: they are purely subjective (modes of thought in Descartes's large sense of the word) and can hence not represent real properties of external objects as the Scholastics mistakenly supposed 17. Although Descartes rejects the use of such notions in the explanation of physical nature, considering them obscure and unscientific, he does not, interestingly, reject them altogether. Qua modes of thought they have a proper use and function, but this use, as will be seen, is unscientific, or rather, extra-scientific. (Descartes does not, as contem- porary scientific reformers, claim that we can do without, and indeed would do better without the so-called qualitative notions, or intentiona- lity, as one would say today. He certainly did not believe that the modes of thought caused by movements in the body would disappear once all the bodily movements causing them would be detected, or that we could, in some distant future, consult fancy instruments instead of our feelings to get a more reliable measure of our actual state of mind). The Aristotelian notion of a soul informing and moving a physical body, obscure as it is when used in the account of physical changes, is derived from our understanding of ourselves as conscious and acting beings. It belongs to the context of human experience and action and has no legitimate application outside this context. 17.

I, VII. 398</page><page sequence="9">Descartes's dualism As Gouhier points out, Descartes, in accepting this scholastic notion in the context of human experience, should not be seen as trying to incorporate a piece of the old philosophy into the new one. Because what Descartes « retains from scholastic philosophy is precisely what has nothing philosophical », namely, the fact of interaction as we experience it all the time, and understand without being philosophers, as when reaching, intentionally, out for bread when we feel hungry, and similar things 18. The moral to be drawn from this, as I understand it, is twofold : not only are notions such as « real qualities » or « qualitative forms » to be excluded from the scientific explanation of nature, but the very phenomena to which they can be meaningfully applied elude, by their nature, scientific explanation. This is also the consequence that Descartes draws : there is no Cartesian science of man, only a science of the human body 19. To qualify as an object of science in Descartes's sense, the body must be considered as a piece of mere mechanically moved extended matter. Important aspects of human nature and experience are hereby left outside the scope of scientific explanations. Does this mean that these other aspects cannot be objects of any clear or distinct knowledge at all ? 5. This is the point at which the traditional two-story picture opposed by Ryle usually enters the scene : Cartesian dualism is said to allow both for a mechanistic science of the extended body, and an indépendant psychological science based on introspection and phenomenological analysis of the mind and its inner states 20. The belief in introspection as a legitimate and privileged method of knowing one's mental states is presented by Ryle as part and parcel of « Descartes's myth »21. It is known as the doctrine of Privileged Access and is supposed to be the « natural counterpart » of a dualistic view of the world 22. 18. Gouhier, 1962, 354. 19. Descartes s only psychological treatise, The Passions of the Soul is, as has often been pointed out, a treatise in the physiology of emotions, and Descartes is conscious of treating the subject from an entirely new point of view, as a "physicist". See the prefatory letter of 14 August to the Passions, AT IX, 326. 20. This picture, incidentally, has more in common with the program Hume and the empiricist have tried to carry out: to develop a science of the mind based on intros- pection and aiming at the discovery of the general laws governing human thought and behavior by methods analogous to those used by Newton in discovering the celestial mechanics. See, e.g., Hume's Treatise on Human Nature. 21. Ryle, 14-15. 22. As Ryle describes it, it is in fact a theory of twofold Privileged Access. Its pro- ponents are supposed to hold (1) " that a mind cannot help being constantly aware of all the supposed occupants of its private stage": and (2) "that it can also deliberately 399</page><page sequence="10">Lilli Alanen Although Descartes undoubtedly held some version of the Priviliged Access theory, he certainly was not committed to all its dubious consequences (cf. above section 2). Far from involving the kind of category-mistake that Ryle's version of Cartesian dualism imputes to him, Descartes's distinction between the mind and the body amounts, on the contrary, to a recognition of the fact that the knowledge of the mind and its states on the one hand, and that of « outer » physical bodies on the other, are totally incomparable. The ways of knowing one's own mind and its states can hence not be considered counterparts of the ways of knowing physical things 23. To see this we must take a closer look at Descartes's notion of mind or thought and the indubitability which Descartes takes to be a distinctive feature of human thoughts. Thinking, as Descartes understands it, does not cover only the acts of the reason or the pure intellect (nous), but all kinds of conscious mental states and events, including the acts of the will and the imagination, as well as emotions and sense perceptions. What is common to all these différents sorts or modes of thinking, is that we are aware of their occurence while having or entertaining them : they are 'thoughts' in Descartes's sense only in so far as they are consciously perceived 24. In Descartes's general use of these terms, 'soul' (anima), 'mind' (mens) and 'thought' (cogitatio) are synonyms, and could best be translated by the general term 'consciousness' 25. scrutinize by a species of non sensuous perception at least some of its own states and operations". Both consciousness (the mind's direct awareness of its present states), and introspection (as described in (2)) are supposed to be equally incorrigible or exempt from error (Ryle 154 f.). 15. Un tne dirrerences and asymmetry between Descartes s notions or the mind and the body see Margaret Wilson, Descartes (1978) 92-99, and Alanen Studies in Cartesian Epistemology and Philosophy of Mind (Acta Philosophica Fennica, 33, 1982) in particular p. 52-53, 64, and 86 ff. 24. " Cogitationis nomine intelligo ilia omnia, quae nobis consciis in nobis fiunt, quatenus eorum in nobis conscientia est : Atque ita non modo intelligere, velle, imaginari, sed etiam sentire, idem est hic quod cogitare". Principia, I par. 9, AT VIII, 7. Cottingham renders the latin conscius by "being aware of' and conscientia by "awareness". See J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff, D.

AT I, 36, AT VII, 217, HR II, 52, AT II, 36. - Descartes held himself the first to assert that the soul or the mind consists only in thought or the faculty of thinking, and this, I believe, is one of the few cases where his claims to originality are fully justified. (See AT VIII 2, 347, HR I, 434). For the novelty of this Cartesian concept of the mind see David Hamlyn, Metaphysics, (Cambridge, 1984), 163 and 167. But Hamlyn, without giving any reasons, expresses doubts concerning the extension of Descartes's cogitatio to any conscious state of mind (Hamlyn, 168). 400</page><page sequence="11">Descartes s dualism All phenomena or objects of awareness that are immediately given to the conscious subject and which, from the point of view of this subject, constitute a kind of indubitable data are mental phenomena or modes of thinking in Descartes's sense of this term. I may have doubts concerning the nature, origins or reality of the various objects of my actual thoughts, but qua actually perceived these phenomena are indubitable. The knowledge of the mind and its immediate objects or contents can hence be said to be certain and "incorrigible", but this incorrigibility, it should be stressed, is very restricted. It pertains to the mental only in the above Cartesian sense : it is limited to actually occurrent conscious perceptions, and the evidence this provides for the certainty of the fact that the subject having these thoughts or per- ceptions exists 26. Basing himself, in the Second Meditation, on the indubitability of these immediately given data or phenomena of consciousness, Descartes infers that he exists as a thinking thing, and he considers this inference as evidently true. The Second Meditation is also the place where Descartes examines the nature of the mind and purports to establish the controversial claim that it is better known or easier to know (notior; plus aisé à connaître) than the body 27. This knowledge, however, seems to amount to nothing other than the certainty that "I think" and "I exist", together with the fact (crucial for Descartes's argument for a real distinction between the mind and the body) that this certainty is acquired prior to and independently of the knowledge that any other thing, his body included, exists 28. 6. Descartes's thesis that the mind and the body are really distinct things, together with the argument on which it is based, are often quoted as evidence that Descartes espoused a Platonistic view of man. For instance, in the Discourse, where this argument is presented in a brief 26. The indubitability or "incorrigibility', hence, does not concern any inter- pretations or judgments associated with or linked to these perceptions. I'm probably mistaken in most of the interpretations or explanations I offer of, e.g., my present emotional state, but that I am tense and unnerved or feel good and cheerful, whatever the causes of my present moods or states are, is indubitable : no further facts of the matter could affect the evidence I have of being actually in this present mood or state. I may be wrong in my description or account of it - it may even be impossible for me to account for it at all -, but I cannot be mistaken in my certainty of having it. To speak of "knowledge" and "certainty" in so far as our actual awareness is concerned might be misleading, but it certainly would be odd to claim that a person could be mistaken about his present mental states or thinkings as immediately perceived by him. 27.

It is not only said to be "entirely distinct from the body", and "more easy to know than the body" but Descartes also claims that "even if the body were not, the soul would not cease to be what it is" (AT VI, 33; HR I, 101). It would however be a mistake to identify the "I" or the "mind", as described in this and corresponding passages in the Discourse, and the Meditations, with the nature of a true man. Descartes's use of the term T, it must be recognized, is somewhat floating, but it is clear that the "I" of the Meditator or the Epistemic Subject whose existence as a purely thinking thing is discovered and established before other things are known in the Second Meditation, should be distinguished from the "I" or the "Self of a real human being whose true nature is discovered only in the Sixth Meditation (cf. the fourth and fifth Discourse). It is only in the order of discovery that the nature of the mind is easier or more certainly known than that of the body according to Descartes29. So although Descartes, having submitted all his former beliefs to the trial of doubt, first discovers himself as merely a thinking thing, he does not hold himself to be only a thinking thing. The only thing Descartes can claim to know for certain, in the Second Meditation, is that he exists as a thinking thing. In concluding, on this basis, that the nature of the "I" is to think or be a thinking thing, Descartes has not yet said anything about the other properties he might have in addition to this 3°. It is not until the Sixth Meditation that Descartes is in a position to analyze the nature of his actual, embodied self or mind31. Of all the properties or powers which in the Second Meditation were said to belong to his nature qua thinking thing, only those of the intellect and the will are here said to be necessary properties of the self. Descartes hence draws a distinction between the nature of the mind in a broader sense: the latter includes modes of thinking (imagination and sense perception) which are not essential to the mind in itself but belong to it 29. Systematically, once the hypothesis of the Deceiver has been overthrown and the rule of evidence established, all general principles and truths meeting Descartes's criterion of being clearly and distinctly perceived are on the same level and known with equal certainty (the nature and the existence of bodies included). See e.g., AT VII, 78, HR, 1, 190 ff., AT VIII, 328, HR I, 301-302. 30. AT VII, 335 HR II, 209, cf. AT IX, 205, HR II, 133, AT VII, 219, HR II, 97. In so far as the knowledge of the nature of the mind is concerned, nothing much has in fact been said, and Gassendi seems quite right in characterizing the mind or self Descartes has discovered as "an unknown somewhat".

These faculties are modes of thought and as such they belong to the mind, but in so far as they depend on the body they are, with regard to the mind alone, accidental properties. But if they are accidental modes of the mind when considered in itself, they are nonetheless necessary properties of the embodied, human mind which is "as it were, intermingled" with the body (AT VII, 80-81, HR I, 192) 33. That Descantes makes a distinction between thoughts or perceptions of the pure mind and those of the embodied human mind is clear from many contexts. And if Descartes rejects the Platonistic view of man it is precisely because it fails to do justice to the phenomena or modes of thought depending on the mind-body union and which are distinctive for our human condition. A pure mind accidentally placed in a particular body could at most move its members, but if it is supposed to have "sensations and appetites similar to our own, and thus form a true man", it is "necessary that it should also be joined and united more closely to the body" (AT VI, 59, HR I, 118). The union of the mind and the body is a fact of experience, something that our nature is said to teach us. The peculiarly "confused" character of the experience through which the intimate union of the mind and the body is revealed is illustrated by the following thought-experiment: if I were, as a merely thinking thing, lodged in my body, I would not feel any pain when my body is hurt, "for I should perceive this wound by the understanding only, just as the sailor perceives by the sight when something is damaged in his vessel". And if my body needs drink or food, "I should clearly understand this fact without being warned by confused feelings of hunger and thirst". Sensations and feelings as pain, hunger and thirst are, Descartes writes "none other than certain confused modes 32. For instance, the power of imagination, which is used to represent extended things and which, as the example of the chiliogone purports to show, requires a special effort, is said to depend "on something that differs from me" and cannot for this reason be said to belong to "the essence of my mind" (AT VII, 73, HR I, 186). The same holds for the faculty of sensation (sense perception) which because of its passive and unpredictable character cannot depend on the mind alone. AT VII, 79, HR I, 191. 33. Cf. The Principles II, par. 2, AT VIII, 41, HR I, 255; To Gibieuf, 19 January 1642, AT III, 473 K, 125-126, and To Regius, January 1642, AT ΙΠ, K, 130.

The connection between particular thoughts and particular bodily movements "causing" or accompanying them is contingent. But the fact that these thoughts are connected to bodily movements is however not contingent but essential to them as thoughts depending on the mind-body union. Cf. below, section 8. 403</page><page sequence="14">Lilli Alanen of thought which are produced by the union and apparent intermingling of the mind and the body" (AT VII, 81, HR I, 192) 34. It is precisely the confusion and obscurity of these thoughts produced by the mind-body union that marks the difference between the nature of human beings and purely rational beings - or the difference between the nature of the embodied mind and a pure mind. If a pure mind, e.g. an angel, were united to a human body, Descartes explains in a letter, it would not have feelings as we have. Instead of being affected with confused thoughts or feelings of the kind that the movements in the body produce in the human mind, the angel would perceive these movements clearly and distinctly. It would, in other words, see the damage caused to the body, without being in any way affected or moved by it 35. The union between the mind and the body is what constitutes the human nature. And it is established or instituted by nature in such a way that certain movements in the body "produce" certain (confused) thoughts "in the mind", informing it hereby of the states and needs of the body (that the mind, were it not for these obscure feelings, might otherwise forget). In spite of their confused and obscure nature, the thoughts caused by bodily movements (sensations and passions) always have "some truth", in them, and to this extent they also have a proper and important function: they serve the preservation and welfare of the body 36. But they cannot be rendered more clear than they are as actually experienced, nor are they intelligible outside the context of the mind-body union and those natural purposes for which they have been instituted. 7. Let us now turn to the distinction between different kinds of knowledge made in Descartes's later writings. The distinction is based on differences in the objects of knowledge and the notions through which they are known. First, the notion of extension, including those of shape and motion, through which bodies are known. Second, the notion of thought, through which the mind and intellectual beings are known, and which includes the concepts of the intellect and the will. Third, the notion of the 34.

By characterizing these three notions as primitive, Descartes wants to stress that each of them can be known or understood only through itself and not by comparison to any other notion, and also that they constitute, each in its proper domain, a kind of presupposition for our knowledge. Thus, all the concepts in terms of which physical bodies are understood presuppose the notion of extension, which in itself cannot be analyzed : it is irreducible. The same holds for the notion of thought, which is presupposed in our knowledge of intellectual things. As to the third primitive notion by which we are supposed to understand the mind- body union, it is irreducible in the same way, which means that it cannot be explicated in terms of more primitive or fundamental notions, as for instance the notions of thought or extension. Descartes's primitive notions, so I understand it, belong to entirely different and incomparable levels of description and explanation. They differ not only through the objects to which they are applied but also in virtue of the ways in which these objects are described and known. The mind and, generally, purely intellectual things can be conceived only by the pure intellect, i.e., by metaphysical thought and meditation. The body and, generally, extension can be clearly and distinctly conceived only by the pure intellect or by the pure intellect aided by the imagination (i.e., geometry). But the union between the mind and the body, and what belongs to this union can, Descartes writes, "be known only obscurely by the pure intellect or by the intellect aided by the imagination, but it can be known very clearly through the senses" (To Elizabeth 28 June 1643, AT III, 693, K, 141). True knowledge or science, Descartes insists, requires that these notions should be carefully separated and applied only to their proper objects or in their proper domains. We should not, for instance, try to use our imagination or the notion of extension to conceive the nature of the soul, nor should we try to "conceive the way in which the soul moves the body after the manner in which one body is moved by another" (To Elisabeth 21 may 1643, K, 138). Scientific knowledge is restricted to what can be accounted for in terms of extension and related notions; metaphysical knowledge to immaterial things (e.g., the mind or God), and generally, to the foundations of knowledge; as to our own nature and condition as embodied minds and agents, we have only our senses and commonsense to rely on. These different kinds of knowledge 37.

But can the inner experience we have of the phenomena pertaining to the third primitive notion be regarded as a kind of knowledge, really ? Can such inherently obscure phenomena be known clearly ? The various modes of thought and extension, respectively, can be clearly and distinctly known only when regarded "simply as modes of the things in which they are located" {Principles I, par. 65, AT VIII, 32). Sensations, emotions and appetites, these "confused" modes of thought depending on the mind-body union, are problematic because of our inrooted habit to refer them to things "located outside us" i.e., to consider them not as modes of thought but as modes of extended things. Yet they can be clearly perceived "provided we take great care in our judgments concerning them to include no more than what is strictly contained in our perception - no more than that of which we have inner aware- ness" 38. The French translation of this passage has connaissance claire et distincte, where the latin says clearly perceived. Gouhier notes that the French translation sometimes renders dare by distinct, but that this latter term is used by Descartes only once in this context: In order to distinguish what is clear in this connection from what is obscure, we must be very careful to note that pain and colour and so on are clearly and distinctly perceived when they are regarded merely as sensations or thoughts (Principles, art. 68, AT VIII, 33) 39. Gouhier, following Hamelin, argues that what is thus immediately experienced can be clearly and distinctly perceived, because clarity and obscurity are relative to the different ways of knowing: what is clearly or distinctly experienced by the senses cannot be translated into clear or distinct rational ideas. The paradigms of clearness and distinctness, and hence of intelligibility, are different for different kinds of knowledge40. Descartes, admittedly, did not give very strict definitions of the terms clear and distinct, and he uses idea and perception in a very broad sense. The characterization and examples he gives of distinct perceptions or ideas seem however to imply that the things pertaining 38. ... qui quidem etiam clare percipi possunt, si accurate caveamus, ne quid amplius de iis judicemus, quam id praecise, quod in perceptione nostra continetur, &amp; cujus intime conseil sumus.

Consider the things listed by Descartes as belonging to the notion of the mind-body union and that we are said to experience within ourselves: appetites of hunger or thirst; emotions or passions like singer, joy, sadness, love, etc.; sensations, such as pain, pleasure, light, sound sind so on {Principles I, par. 48, AT VIII, 23, HR I, 238). As modes of thought they are states of the mind, but since they sire states of the mind caused by bodily movements they depend on the mind-body union. Their status is peculiar, for ontologically they belong to the mind, but causally and functionally they belong to the mind-body union and can therefore not be known or understood without reference to this union 42. This union, again, cannot be explained because the notion we have of it is primitive, irreducible. In modern philosophy of mind these things have been construed as "private" mental objects which, on the view attributed to Descartes, can be studied and known through introspection, by the mind's inward gaze on its own states. Does Descartes not hold that they can be clearly and distinctly known, as modes of thought, by the conscious mind attending to its own thoughts? There is, as we have seen, a sense in which any thought, in Descartes's wide sense of the word, is clearly known sind indubitable. This follows from Descartes's definition of thought as anything of which we are immediately conscious (cf. above, section 5). However, the clsiim that any thought, as an imediately given, indubitable datum is evidently known, does not entail the view that all thoughts are known or perceived with equal clarity and distinctness. A perception (thought) which meets Descsirtes's requirement of being both clear and distinct is "so sepsirated sind delineated from sill others that it contains absolutely nothing except what is clear" (Principles I, psir. 45). A perception is called "clear" "when it is present and accessible to the attentive mind", i.e., when it is "visible" to the mind as the actual object of its attention or awsireness 43. Mathematical propositions and other "self-evident" principles like "If equals are taken from equals the 41. Gilson makes the point quite clear in stressing that the notion of the mind-body union is not an idea of the same order as that of the mind and the body: the latter, he says, are innate ideas of the intellect or understanding, the former "une idée adventice de l'ordre de la sensibilité". The notion of the union is, Gilson argues, a 'pseudo-idea': something that can be perceived only by the senses but not conceived by the intellect. Gilson (1930) 1975, 249. 42. Ct.

As to the sensations and emotions they can, as we saw, be clearly perceived without being also distinctly perceived (cf. above note 38). Usually, by habit and prejudice, they are associated with false judgments concerning their origins, objects and causes, and to that extent they are confused and obscure 44. This confusion, I want to claim, is in a sense inherent it the thoughts depending on the mind-body union: the human mind is so constituted that it cannot perceive all their causes or how they sire caused. We lack the conceptual resources for conceiving, distinctly, the mind-body interaction - its details are not only unknown but unintelligible (cf. Principles IV, par. 198, AT VIII, 322). It is hence not a confusion that could be clarified by empirical research, by brain physiology for instance. Nor is it, as Norman Malcolm suggests, a mere conceptual confusion, or one that could be clarified by conceptual analysis 45. it is rather a distinctive feature of the human mind, expressing its limited and imperfect nature as an embodied mind. But if this is an imperfection from the point of view of the rational mind and its claims to clear and distinct knowledge, it is also the main source of contentment to which we can aspire as human beings. For, as Descartes points out, it is of the most confused and unintelligible thoughts or states of mind, namely the passions, that all good and evil in life can be said to depend, "so that persons whom the passions can move most deeply are capable of enjoying the sweetest pleasures of this life" (AT XI, 488, HR I 427)46. 9. Norman Malcolm, in a recent book, develops what I take to be convincing arguments against some modern materialist theories of mind, which, in Malcolm's view, are fatal also to Cartesian dualism. These arguments, interestingly, seem not very different from those used by Descartes himself in reply to the objection that he could not explain the mind-body union. According to Malcolm, Descartes held that "an invisible, intangible, immaterial mind is that which thinks, wills and suffers", and he also held 44. AT VII, 82, HR I, 193: AT VIII, 41, HR I, 255. 45.

Armstrong &amp; Malcolm 1984, 100-101. 408</page><page sequence="19">Descartes s dualism that feelings like "joy, fear, surprise, regret, dismay, are states of immaterial minds". This theory Malcolm rightly takes to be as absurd as the one proposed by present-day philosophers, "that the human brain, or even computational states of machines, are bearers of mental predicates"47. But Malcolm, I believe, is wrong in ascribing such a view to Descartes. It is true that Descartes held that immaterial minds can think and will, and he also held that the acts of the pure understanding are in some sense independent of the body. But it is far from clear in what sense Descartes holds them to be independent and what the implications of this view are. Descartes, as we have seen, considers the human mind as substantially united to the body. He also seems to hold that all the thoughts of the embodied mind, even those which are said to depend on the mind alone (as the acts of the pure intellect or understanding) have some physiological correlates 48. What Descartes's argument for a real distinction between the mind and the body proves, if anything, is - as Malcolm himself agrees - the logical possibility of their separability, not their actual separation 49. The logical possibility of the separation of the mind and the body by no means precludes their being really and actually united. Also, the implications of Descartes's thesis that the mind and the body are really distinct, (i.e., conceptually or logically distinct) are, it seems to me, very different from those Malcolm wants to draw 5°. 48. See, e.g. To Chanut, 1 February 1647, AT IV 600 ft, K, 209 ff., and Passions I, art. 41 AT XI, 360, HR I, 350 passim, where it is assumed that every thought leaves some cerebral trace and is also joined, by nature and habit, to some movements in the brain and where the power of the soul to control and master the passions is made to depend on this fact. - This reading differs from that of Wilson, who stresses the differences between Descartes's own "robust" and antiquated dualism and some modern versions of Cartesian dualism in this respect. Descartes, according to Wilson, not only denied the identity of mental and bodily states but also excluded any correlation between those mental states Descartes calls purely intellectual acts and capacities and any physical, cerebral states. The exercise of pure understanding, for instance thinking of God of the mind in itself is, she claims, "carried on independently of all physical processes ; any physiological study will necessarily be irrelevant to it". Wilson, Descartes, 1978, 181, and Wilson, in Hooker, 1978, 197-211. Wilson, undoubtedly, is right in insisting that the scientific account of the brain and the physiological correlates would be considered by Descartes completely irrelevant to the understanding of the acts and states of the mind qua mental acts and states. But I think she exaggerates the contrast between what she calls historical and "contem- porary" Cartesian dualism, and the evidence that Descartes held that the acts of the pure intellect, in the mind's present embodied state, actually could occur without any physiological correlates, is inconclusive.

For the modes of thought depending on the mind-body union cannot be clearly and distinctly known through any privileged non-empirical method (introspection or conceptual ana- lysis). Nor can they be explained or clarified by empirical investigations or scientific methods in the narrower sense of the word. So we sire left with the "simple" or "primitive" notion of the mind-body union, by which we are supposed to understand these phenomena. But what kind of understanding, one might ask, can be obtained through such an obscure and problematic notion? Can we be said to have any clear or distinct knowledge of the phenomena pertaining to this notion besides being aware of their occurrence? How can sensory experience that Descartes holds to be inherently obscure serve as the basis of any knowledge? Because of this difficulty most of Descartes's commentators and critics have rejected his answer to Princess Elizabeth as totally unsatisfactory. Descartes, it is claimed, offers an unexplained and unexplainable notion as an explanation of an unintelligible fact of experience (the mind-body interaction) 51. But it is a mistake to regard the notion of the mind-body union as an explanation of this fact52. Because Descartes's point, precisely, is that it is a matter of actual or past experience which, as such, cannot be explained, and which does not, moreover, require further explanation. The third primitive notion does not offer us smother kind of rational knowledge differing from that obtained through the other two primitive notions by the evidence on which it is based, (the evidence of senses as opposed to rational argument or mathematical demons- tration). It is not, I want to suggest, comparable to knowledge in the sense of a system of certain or well justified beliefs at all. Rather, the domain of the third primitive notion is that of the awareness we have of our actual states and of the "tacit knowledge" involved in daily experience and action. To "know" or "understand" a mental state is to have it, to be in that state, sis to understand the mind-body interaction or the abilities intentional action involves is just to do things, to move 51. For recent discussions see, e.g., Daisy Radner, " Descartes' Notion of the Union of Mind and Body", Journal of the History of Philosophy, vol IX, (1971): 159-170, and Janet Broughton and Ruth Mattern, "Reinterpreting Descartes on the Notion of the Union of Mind and Body" Journal of the History of Philosophy, vol XVI, (1978): 23-32. 52.

We can and do describe these phenomena in ordinary language, in terms of commonsense psychology, but we can neither identify nor account for them at any other level of description, nor can we render them clearer than they are as perceived by metaphysical, logical or neurophysiological investi- gations S4. Consider, once again, the answer Descartes gave his correspondent, Princess Elizabeth. Such understanding, he declares, is best achieved by those who never philosophize but use only their senses55. Far from seeing it as an attempt to explain away a difficulty that Descartes was incapable of solving in a satisfactory manner, I take this answer to express the important insight that the notion we have of the union of the mind and body is primarily a notion belonging to commonsense psychology which, as such, cannot be rendered clearer by any further, logical or scientific analysis. It is not a philosophical or scientific concept^ but a nontechnical notion, one that "everyone has in himself without philosophizing". Everyone can feel, without doing philosophy or fancy experiments "that he is a single person with both body and thought so related by nature that the thought can move the body and feel the things which happen to it » 56. Thought and extension, as Descentes defines them, are technical notions, serving specific epistemological and scien- 53. I am redevable to Bob Brandom for having pointed out the inadequacy of describing this (as Descartes and most of his commentators do) as a kind of knowledge. For the phenomena pertaining to the third primitive notion seem to consist rather in the various abilities and skills we exercise as agents and in the states of consciousness in which we are: in being agents and in being conscious of our actual states. 54. I am here siding with Gouhier and those who like Gouhier have stressed the pre-philosophical character of the notion of the substantial union as well as of the awareness of the mind-body union this notion is supposed to express. (Cf. Henri Gouhier, 1962, 351, and Radner, op. cit.). But Gouhier, while insisting that the immediate experience of interaction, what Gouhier calls the "psycho-physiology", necessarily escapes scientific account, thinks that Descartes's theory still leaves room for a properly scientific account of the relations between mental and bodily states, "une science positive des rapports de l'âme et du corps!'. Cf. Gouhier, 1962, 344. It is not clear to me what that "positive science" would be. What we can have is a scientific (physiological) account of bodily changes and movements concomitant to mental states, but there can be no scientific account of lawful correlations between kinds of mental states and bodily states, since the descriptions of the former are irreducible to descriptions of the latter, and depend on mutually incompatible and independent primary notions. Cf. Davidson's classification of Descartes's dualism as "anomalous dualism", in " mental Events" (1970), repr. in Donald Davidson, Essays on Actions and Events, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980) p. 213. 55.

The notion that we have of ourselves as human, conscious and corporeal persons is a non-technical, natural notion that cannot be defined or explained in terms of these technical notions. While the latter are clear and distinct to the philosopher, the former is not, because its meaning can only be understood in the context of ordinary language and the non-philosophical, extra scientific purposes that it serves. like other concepts of ordinary language it is, we might say, logically primitive: it cannot be translated into technical (philosophical or scientific) terms without losing its original meaning. Is this not to say that Descartes had no real philosophical solution to the famous mind-body problem? In a sense, yes 57. But Descartes was at least lucid enough to admit the difficulty and, admitting it, to recognize the limits of the knowledge that can be acquired in terms of clear and distinct rational concepts. This insight is not merely a negative one. Recognizing the limits of rational knowledge and explanation Descartes at the same time acknowledged the value and importance of a kind of knowledge or, should we say, experience, too often neglected by philosophers: the one gained through the senses and used in daily action and interaction with fellow human beings. It is primarily a practical experience which is legitimate in its proper domain and which cannot be replaced by any other kind of knowledge58. It differs both by its nature and purposes from scientific knowledge and can therefore not be judged by the standards of the latter. One should never, as Aristotle warned, try to seek more precision or clearness than what the subject-matter admits of59. The notion of a mind or consciousness united to a physical body may be crude and incomplete when judged by the standards of scientific knowledge. But that need not bother us as long as this and related concepts have a use in those extra-scientific contexts where they are ordinarily applied. What is important is to recognize that they cannot be torn out of that context and that their use in scientific explanation leads to absurdities. To quote Norman Malcolm: 57. Again, the problem, I take it, is not that of the interaction but the conceivability of a substantial union between two entities which are known only through logically independent and incompatible notions. (Cf. note 16 above). The difficulty here is mainly to understand how the notions of the mind and the body, or of thought and extension, as used in the philosophical discourse, are related to the terms mind and body of commonsense psychology and "ordinary language". Does it make any sense to suppose that we are talking of the same things here, conceived first as distinct, and then as united? If not, the very notion of a mind-body union seems fundamentally inadequate and misleading. 58. Cf. the Sixth Meditation and the analysis of the relevant passages offered by Martial Gueroult, 1968, vol II, 55 ff. and 96-1 18. 59. NE, I, 3 1094 b. 412</page><page sequence="23">Descartes s dualism "... our attributions of attitudes, emotions, feelings to people only make sense in relation to their interests, concerns, engagements, family ties, work, health, rivalries - and make no sense at all as attributions to disembodied minds, or to brains or machines" 6°. Mental terms may be vague and indeterminate as compared to scientific concepts, but we still understand them well enough to be able to use them in our daily life and our dealings with other people. Even philosophers master the use of these concepts, but, as Malcolm observes, when they step into their study, they become as it were bewitched: "They no longer understand what they have always known. They no longer see what has always been plain in view" (loc. cit.). In asking Princess Elizabeth to abstain from meditations and the study of mathematics to turn instead to the domain of ordinary life and conversation in order to understand the mind-body union, Descartes could as well had said with Wittgenstein: "God grant the philosopher insight into what lies in front of everyone's eyes"61. Ulli Alanen Université d'Helsinki 60. Armstrong &amp; Malcolm, 1984, 101. 61. Quoted by Malcolm, 1984, 101. - Earlier versions of this paper have been read at the Fifth Nordic Philosophy Conference, Hanaholmen, Finland, to the members of Philosophy Colloquia at Temple University, Philadelphia, and Hampshire College Amherst. I wish to thank all the persons with whom I have had the opportunity to discuss it, particularly David Hamlyn, Lars Hertzberg, Norman Malcolm, Heikki Kannisto, Frederick Stoutland, Robert Brandom and Jay Gardield for valuable comments on an earlier draft. My thanks are due also to the editor of this revue for urging me to take more substantial account of the writings of French scholars. I will deal more extensively with the interpretations I have not been able to discuss here, like that recently defended by Jean-Marie Beyssade, in his paper "La classification cartésienne des passions", Revue internationale de Philosophie, vol. 136, 1983, p. 278-287, in a more extensive study of the subject that I am actually working on. 413</page></plain_text>
