Member of the Inststut de France. THE constitution of a mathematical physics marks the advent of modern thought. Homo sapiens is for Descartes before everything homo mathematicus. Man's function is to establish connexions of ideas. Ideas are completely transparent to intelligence. They proceed from the simple to the complex and construct their own objects. The strength of this con- struction. evident in the success of analytical geometry, is such that it exhausts, at one stroke as it were, both the capacity of the human mind and the knowledge of nature. Descartes, appealing to the infinite perfections of God, posits a priori the fundamental equations of universal movement so that the theory of the world completely satisfies the needs of mathematical ideality. There is a paradox even in the wish to have a purely deductive system of cosmology. It raises difficulties which were clearly brought out in the seventeenth century, in the occasionalist criticism of Malebranche, and in the experimental philosophy of Newton. At the same time, both in Malebranche's view and in Newton's, the result of those difficulties was to underline the character of perfect intelligibility belonging to mathematics in contrast to the persistent obscurity of physics. It is by mathematics that the Word, the communication between man and God, fulfils its manifestation. On the other hand, it is those same difficulties which Kant thought he had solved when he substituted the human a priori for the divine, so degrading as</page><page sequence="2">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 43 it were, the digaity of mathematical truth. The justification of arithmetic and geometry is achieved by him on a level on which there is room for a quite similar justification of the Newtonian science. The fact that phenomena must be apprehended and co-ordinated under the twofold form of temporal intuition and spatial intuition gives us the right to prescribe to the universe the conditions of its determinism. The pre-existence of the Transcendental Aesthetic in relation to the Transcendental Logic in the Kantian doctrine carries wholly different consequences according to whether it is the logic of science or the logic of metaphysics which we are considering. The a priori necessity of the forms of sensible intuition assures the physicist that the principles of the understanding are always and everywhere applicable to the universe of experience; the scientific " extrapolation" will therefore not fail. But the very conditions on which, for Kant, the success of the Analytic or first part of the Logic depends, call for and explain the check in the Dialectic or second part. The metaphysical "extrapolation" proceeds from an illusory imagination which, basing itself on the absolute reality of space and time, is inevitably lost in the mathematical antinomies, inherent in the concepts of the finite and the infinite attaching to extension and duration, and in the concepts of the radically simple and of the infinitely composite. The opposition between the conclusions of the Analytic and those of the Dialectic, between the principles of the under- standing and the ideas of reason, implies a " morality," which positivism has made explicit: " physics beware of metaphysics." The system of the world is one and the same for a Newton who begins by invoking the absolute in space and time, and for a Laplace who makes the relativity of the dimensions of the universe depend on the intrinsic relativity of Euclidean Space. The conception of a scientific positivity, from which every hypothesis can be eliminated, was natural in Newton's age, as</page><page sequence="3">44 LEON BRUNSCHVICG. it was also in Laplace's. Our discovery of the non-Euclidean geometries has, however, revealed to us that a hypothesis had actually slipped in, precisely the hypothesis that we are not making a hypothesis when we make the development of mathematical physics depend on the rationality of Euclidean Space (and let us add, for us to-day, on the unity of universal time). If then, like Henri Poincare, we still maintain the supremacy of the mathematical frames, supposed intangible and impermeable, in relation to their content of physical experience, it must be that the variety of these frames will itself make it impossible to see in them anything but conventions which concern measure- ment; conventions, all equally artificial and between which, theoretically, choice is free. Henceforward mathematical physics will have to say, Hypotheses non nisi fingo. The crisis of a partial scepticism in science which arose in the preceding generation has been surmounted by the contem- porary theories of relativity, because now within nathematical physics the r0le of the factors appears inverted. Instead of a relativism essentially mathematical we now have a relativism fundamentally physical. And this revolution in scientific inter- pretation has a peculiarly deep root: it goes to the meaning of measure. Previous to Einstein the function of measure in phy- sics was the application in the domain of experience of processes of which pure theory could give a sufficient account; for measure was by means of the mathematician's ideal space and unique time. Contemporary science no longer recognizes the duality of the two moments, that of the mathematical theory and that of the physical application. Measure is entirely a physical operation, accomplishing itself in real nature, having instruments which are not reducible to mathematical ideas, to perfect concepts. Measuring and measured are both real things; they possess properties which cannot be foreknown by deductive reasoning. They are only disclosed by experience. It is experience which</page><page sequence="4">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 45 forces us to recognize that for the effective determination of time we must take into account the intervention of the luminous propagation just as in the determination of the spatial configura- tion of the universe the coefficients of gravitational action intervene. This is what is new and what is decisive. The importance of the mathematician's contribution to the elaboration of mathe- matical physics is in no way diminished; but from the point of view of philosophy the physiognomy of science is seen to be modified. The more the mathematician has succeeded in effacing himself and throwing into relief the specificity of physics, the more he has fulfilled his mission. Einstein might repeat Descartes's saying: " Ma physique est geometrie." Only, at the dawn of modern science the geometrization of experience meant the mathematician's right to dictate his orders to physics, and physics had to obey. To-day, on the contrary, the most subtle mathematics is at the service of the physicist, and he alone decides what is true or what is false, because he alone is in nature's councils. The problem of mathematical physics has definitely and radically changed its meaning: it no longer needs to impose the apodeictic form of geometry on the world, but to adapt a certain type of geometry to the indications which the universe furnishes on its own account. The time has come, then, for philosophy to call in question the postulate of the Kantian criticism, out of which the specula- tive controversies of the nineteenth century arose : the priority of the Transcendental Aesthetic in regard to the Transcendental Logic. We no longer need spend our time or exhaust our energy in speculating on space in itself, or on time in itself, nor yet on matter and causality asindependent concepts. We are immediately concerned with the universe itself, which our mind constitutes, not by appealing to our faculty of " extrapolating " immediately and to infinity, but, on the contrary, by advancing step by step,</page><page sequence="5">46 LEON BRUNSCHVICG. from element to element, establishing the formula of the invariant, by which we bind together, in reciprocal relativity, the diversity of the systems of reference. Space and time cannot be appre- hended so long as we seek to apprehend them isolated in their characteristic individuality and anterior to a universe which can only be the sum of its two mathematical components. Space and time are truly understood in so far as they are really measured in function of one another and in abstraction from the universe of which they are solidary aspects, and which itself must be ante- cedently posited. In scientific philosophy we no longer begin by asking what space is, or what time is, but by asking what the universe is. Does it follow that our problem will be easier ? Surely the solutions which classical tradition has bequeathed to us are too simple. The Cartesian idealism made tabula rasa of the world of sensible qualities, substituting for it an intelligible universe, determined a priori by the metaphysical essence of quantity. We at our present stage mark the check to this mathematical idealism; this, however, cannot mean that we have to be brought back to the ancient qualitative vision of things, to a supra-mathematical knowledge revealing the true image of nature. The theory of relativity asks us to envisage the world as a world of numbers, a non-Euclidean multiplicity in four dimensions, defying every attempt at immediate representation. We must even say that we are no longer speaking of the world when we detach it from the language in which the calculus ex- presses it. The world is defined as the concrete meaning of an abstract expression, a meaning for which the evidence and guarantee of experience are needed at each instant and at every point. To settle a priori from among the mathematical combinations we can conceive and develop, which do and which do not correspond to something effectively existent in nature, is as far beyond our power as it is to say of a word from the look</page><page sequence="6">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 47 of the syllables, however they may be combined, that it is actually a word of a European language. There is no mathematical container from which we can draw the determination of the physical content ; conversely, there is no physical content which can be isolated from its mathematical envelope and seen and possessed apart. What is important is to know how to read the reality through the numbers, as Hegel could discern the reality through the concepts. The true concrete universal is not a product of logical forms, however subtle and however ample they may be; it is a composition of equations whose combination, however strange it may appear, is called for by the need for facts. To minds accustomed to the rigid, would-be definitive, separations of the rational categories or even of the scientific disciplines, the advent of the new mathematical physics, with its strange warped universe, is a kind of scandal. It is incumbent in the interest of philosophy to find a way of correcting such irregularities and putting an end to their in- roads. Will philosophy fulfil this hope ? I will take an illus- tration in order to be brief and yet keep my meaning clear. Present science in face of nature holds a front as tortuous and also as paradoxical as that which separated the Allies from the German armies between the autumn of 1914 and the summer of 1918. There are some parts of science of which we can say that they are organized in advance. For example, in acoustics there is no difficulty whatever in indicating the medium in which sound is transmitted and the manner of transmitting it, whilst in the present state of optics, which the physicists for so long a time have tried to model on acoustics, we cannot begin at the beginning, that is, define with assurance the character of the medium of propagation, or explain the origin of the phenomena of radiation or emission. Now can we appreciate and situate this precarious stage of science with regard to what the true definitive</page><page sequence="7">48 LEON BRUNSCHVICG. constitution of things would be ? A Philosophy of Nature, above science because it has to judge the relation of science to absolute reality, no doubt will claim to be able to reply. It will assume our capability of apprehending the universe, not simply from our human standpoint, that of beings engaged in a daily struggle against the difficulties and obscurities of our experience, as much embarrassed as helped by the weighty complication of our mathematical and physical apparatus, but the universe such as it is in itself, on the other side of the trench; in a word, it will assume that we have achieved the break through. Now, however, we know that we shall never break through, because in this case the very idea of a break through is contradictory. We can force nature back by taking possession of territories which till now have been withheld from the domination of our understanding, and in this way we can enlarge the domain of human knowledge; it is only too clear that we never pass out of that domain; we abide in our place at our post, on the human, the mental side. The Philosophy of Science has for its task the establishing over and above the abrupt, contingent, provisional results of scientific knowledge, a simple and harmonious order which is to be " ami de la raison." It is not so ambitious as the philosophy of nature: it is no less illusory. By what right, indeed, and for what good, do we pass behind the effective knowledge, the truth-value of which we can keep under experimental control, in order to superimpose on it, and substitute for it, a knowledge which would be such as presumably it should be but such as actually it is not ? The military academies with their pedagogic tradition would have required no doubt that the tortuous front of 1914 should be rectified as soon as possible; but it was not, because real war is not Kriegspiel any more than a physical experiment is a purely mathematical combination. For years the real front was different from and without relation to the theoretical front, which ought to have been shorter and straighter,</page><page sequence="8">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 49 just as the geometry of the real world appears to be quite different from the Euclidean geometry which in itself is the simplest possible. Philosophy has nothing whatever to gain by seeking to main- tain the a priori forms or abstract categories of perfectly homo- geneous space and absolute time. It is more instructive and arouses a richer reflection to disentangle the motives which have compelled man to sacrifice the voluptuousness of repose in the simplicity of the harmony in which a Pythagoras delighted, in order to form an idea of the world, which the more it becomes conformable to reality the more it must disappoint the expecta- tion of an easy and clear imagination. The sinuosities, the cross directions, of our present science, invite the human mind to return on its past, look back on its hopes and disappointments, discern the causes of its checks and triumphs, define itself in function of the effort pursued through generations to understand nature; in short, to draw from the becoming of mathematical physics a Philosophy of Thought. The thought which constitutes the science of nature cannot, any more than nature itself, be divined a priori. We are at the outset disconcerted by the formidable array of laboratory instru- ments, methods of the calculus, which encumber the avenues of contemporary physics giving the impression of the oddest, most artificial, technique. It is as astonishing that these avenues should lead to reality, as that the accumulation of characteris ically human inventions (the microscope or the spectroscope, the Riemannian geometry or the calculus of tensors) should be capable of assuring the objective value of knowledge. Neither the dogmatism of mathematical ideas nor the dog- matism of logical concepts, which marched side by side for centuries, and which Leibniz and Kant vainly tried to reconcile, can offer an explanation of the fact of science itself. Both depend on the preconception of a truth which dwells in the absolute and E</page><page sequence="9">50 LAON BRUNSCHVICG. is discoverable at a glance, and which does not participate in the subjectivity of human representations, although the essential character of science consists in that bond between the human and the objective through which the lines of the universe become more precise and more exact as the structure of human knowledge appears more complicated and refined. Are we then to-day called on to form this idea of the human mind in accord with the design of the universe as science traces it, forging it of its diverse pieces as if it suddenly surged up before us because of the strange but effective discovery which the theories of relativity represent ? For my part, I do not think so. The theories of relativity are the outcome of the critical reflection by which we have learned to think of the student not as the creator of nature or as the imitator of its creator but as the author of science. We are led, therefore, before these speculative problems, to take up the attitude which was inaugurated by Socrates when he set aside the demiurgic mythology of the physiologues in order to concentrate man's attention on his own inward nature, on the specific activity of understanding. To define this attitude of the homo Socraticus, I will take the simplest illustration. Socrates is addressing his son Lamprocles, who, exposed to the scoldings of Xanthippe, has obeyed the instinct in him to answer her back with saucy words. He bids him remember that he is not a "self- contained" individual but a son, standing before a mother who has risked her life in giving him birth, who has nourished and tended him. As soon as Lamprocles understands, he ceases, by a necessary consequence of the thought developed in him, to be exclusively himself; he sees himself from another's standpoint, and the rule of his conduct henceforward is the rational bond which makes the action of one person correspond with the just reaction of another; the two systems of wills are defined by their reciprocal</page><page sequence="10">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 51 relativity. Again, when Socrates reflected on justice, and made others reflect, it was not to attain the just in itself which pre- occupied him, but to discover precisely how in each particular case --of parents, of friends, of enemies,-the manner of acting must be adapted to the correlation of functions. The moral unity of the family arises from the convergence between the idea the mother has of the son and the idea the son has of the mother. In the same way, the idea that the legislator is himself made of the citizen and the idea that the citizen is himself made by the law, meet in order to constitute the just city. In the end the notion of humanity appears, not as the abstraction of a generic concept, but as the correlative system of rights and duties, which each of us creates to the extent that, freeing himself from the limits of his individuality, he enlarges the horizon around, him, in order to raise himself above the narrowness of established rules, to the ideality, to the universality, of the unwritten law. Such is the Humanism which I think we can use profitably in the interpretation of contemporary physics, relying on the con- tinuity through the ages, and the unchangeableness, of the western mind. The Socratic humanism is the opposite of the biological humanism inspired by Protagoras. The latter leaves nothing subsisting but the irreducible multiplicity of representations. Between the normal perception of colours and the simplified vision of a Daltonian, we may note differences and signify them by words; but it is impossible to efface those differences and set up what would be colour in itself, independently of the structure of the human retina and of the anomalies which belong to different categories of individuals. The relativity of sensible data encloses each of us in the absolute of his own singularity, incomparable and incommunicable in relation to the singularity of another's consciousness. To escape the consequences of this biological relativism, we must be able to rise above the singularity of the conscious E2</page><page sequence="11">52 LEON BRUNSCHVICG. individuals by positing an object which is anterior to all represen- tation. It is this realist need which Leibniz himself recognized when he wrote : " It is true that the same thing can be differently represented; but there must always be an exact relation between the representation and the thing, and consequently between the different representations of one and the same thing." Does this mean, however, that all hope of understanding the correspondence, of founding the harmony, between minds must disappear if the intuition of things in themselves should disappear-for the Leibnizian dogmatism still maintained the hypothesis of things in themselves which the Kantian criticism has definitely ruined ? It is here that intellectualist relativism comes on the scene in order to solve, or, more precisely, to dissipate, the antinomies of sub- jectivism and ontology. That wherein the different perspectives of the universe are unified is not an absolute, postulated in order that metaphysical deduction may begin, but the ideal threshold to which the methods of approximation and convergence which science practices lead. Everyone has a representation of the universe taken at a certain moment, from a particular position, destined to be transformed according to the original rhythm of his own movement. But because man is endowed with reason no one is condemned to dwell a prisoner in his own representation. His disinterested reflection, his abundant invention, of which mathematics has been the instrument on the speculative terrain, enable him to connect his centre of perspective with other centres of perspectives; he succeeds in making good the disparity, the apparent contradictions, which the diversity of positions and individual evolutions introduces into the manifold representations of the universe; he disengages, not something subsisting as common beneath the representations, which could only be a schematic and impoverished concept, but the rule of the intellectual action by which we pass from one system of reference to another system of reference, the equation of an invariant.</page><page sequence="12">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 53 It was exactly such an attitude which the human mind had to take up when it had to surmount the paradox of the antipodes. But the symmetry of the antipodes in relation to the centre of the earth at least allowed an easy play to the imagination, whereas the contemporary theories of relativity require the philosopher to understand the objectivity of a universe of which there is no picture for representation, and which lacks what for the realist imagination characterizes the existence of an object. The diffi- culty will be lightened, however, when we observe that it is not a difficulty belonging to mathematical physics alone, for it had already appeared and been solved in a domain which we think of as entirely abstract, the theory of numbers. As Pascal observed, the form in which certain numbers are written in a particular system of numeration gives a peculiar simplicity to a particular rule of divisibility, for example, to the divisibility by 9 in the decimal systems, by 11 in the duodecimal. The mathematician's art lies precisely in discerning what, in the framing of formulae of divisibility, belongs to the choice of the conventional systems of numeration, and what expresses the inmost nature of the numbers: ima numerorum natura. We shall hold the key of scientific philosophy, so far as it deals with mathematics and physics, when we are able to separate these two problems from one another: to attain the objectivity of science by means of the truth of the formulae of relation; to satisfy the realist need of the object by the absolute of a concept or an intuition. Not only are the two problems radically dis- tinct, but we may even say that, if the realist imagination had effectively responded to its own needs, the scientific worker's task would have been superfluous. Realism is true only on con- dition that it is true at first sight ; Epicurus has got to be justified in saying that the sun exists in the very space in which we perceive it, with the magnitude which our eyes attribute to it. If we have had to give ourselves so much trouble to establish by</page><page sequence="13">54 LiN BRUNSCHVICG. a more and more extended knowledge of facts a more and more precise calculation of the solar dimensions, in order to satisfy ohat is legitimate in the realist aspiration for truth, it is because intelligence is not a faculty of immediate data, but a function of progressive elaboration. It is because it is with the sun as it is with humanity, we know both alike, not by eliminating abruptly the differences of the individual perspectives, to which we are each of us bound by our sensible organism, but by gathering all together in a more and more ample net of more and more coherent intellectual relations. Humanity is no more than the shadow of a word apart from the rules of action which we practise in regard to our parents, our fellow citizens, and our fellow creatures generally; and the realsunis no more than the determination of its numerical elements by astronomy. These elements are formed by measurements of space and time; but this does not mean that they are given in a certain space and in a certain time previously defined in order to receive them. On the contrary, the knowledge which we have of space and time depends on the progress of physics ; extension and duration are implied, line for line, moment for moment, in the tissue of the facts of physical experience, facts registered by man, but which are not, or rather are no longer, human facts. In the ancient world, the representation of space was dominated by the way our organism feels the effects of weight: the world had an up and a down; to-day it is gravitational action, but punctuated, according to its intrinsic course, which enables us to indicate the configuration of the universe. Formerly we measured distances by filling the interval with our own steps; now we speak of light- years. These examples may serve perhaps to reveal the historical role which I am assigning to the essentially mathematical rela- tivism which has reigned from Descartes to Henri Poincar6: it has the decisive importance of a dividing line. It goes further</page><page sequence="14">THE MATHEMATICAL AND THE PHYSICAL. 55 than the anthropomorphic finalism, of which contemporary pragmatism has, by a curious fate, renewed the tradition and at the same time carried criticism to the bitter end. It falls short of the relativism on a physical basis, in which the human means of the calculus and of experimentation are used with the single view of discovering, through the necessary human forms of our language, the non-human root of the real, and which is the prelude to a new progress of philosophy, re-establishing in the centre of our intellectual consciousness the pure and authentic value of truth.</page></plain_text>
