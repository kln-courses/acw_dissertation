Bagley. xviii 228 pp. London: George Allen anc Unwin, 1985. ?15.95. A journalist, novelist and politician witE classical religious training, 'All Dashtl served ir the Senate of Iran from 1954 to 1979. He diec shortly after the Iranian revolution in unclea] circumstances (he had been arrested and beater but was later released) at the age of about 85 He wrote a number of religious books, mainlz on $ufi themes, as well as this work on Muh. am mad, Blst u sEh sal, published in about 1974. The book was printed anonymously in Beirut for, ar Professor Bagley explains in his introduction the period 1971 to 1977 was one of intense . censors nlp in Iran, especially of works likely tc create trouble among the religious classes. Create trouble this book may well have done but not in the way that one might immediatelz anticipate. The aim of the work is to do awa) with all the myths surrounding Muhammad anc the foundation of Islam (myths promulgated b) Muslims and orientalists, although the latter dc receive a fair degree of positive acknowledge ment) and to undermine the sociologica observation that religious belief always seems tc blunt human reason. The book proceeds with a narrative account of Muhammad, the Qur'ar and the early history of Islam but it is also al times a topical treatment of all the subjects which are perceived to be stumbling blocks fo] the modern, intellectual believer. As such, the work fits into a recognizable genre of Islamic modernist writing but its distinctiveness and indeed, its power to cause trouble, lies in the directness and forcefulness of its stated position These are not statements concerning Muham- mad that are couched behind intellectual con- structs, as one may find in the writings of Fazlux Rahman for example, but are conclusions stated plainly for all to comprehend. The appeal is made to psychology and soci- ology in order to understand the life of Muh. amu mad; such a historical reconstruction carries with it the inevitable refrain of ' perhaps ' and i must have '. Many of the positions taken are familiar from other modernist writers. The mi'raj was a spiritual journey; the process oi revelation is one that works through Muham- mad's own intellect, the miracle of the Qur'an lies in the results that it has had and not in its eloquence or the like, freewill is the only poss- ible understanding of human existence; nothinE supernatural is to be accepted in the context of the life of Muhammad all can be accounted for by psychology. None of this is surprising nor even potentially upsetting to more con- servative Muslims. It is when Dashh starts investigating the implications of some of these positions that one sees the extent of his modern- ism. Muhammad was just a man; he will have made mistakes, thus there comes about the doctrine of abrogation and the Satanic verses. The Qur'an is full of grammatical irregularities, as should be expected from an illiterate man. The Qur'an is indeed untranslatable, but that is equally true of the poetry of Hafiz. The pil- o grimage is a continuation of ancient rites which are ' useless and meaningless ' remnants of seventh-century Arabia, like so many other items of law and ritual (e.g., the attitude towards women). After a discussion of Muham- mad's wives and his various problems which were resolved by Qur'anic revelation, Dashtl states: ' Every reader of the Qor'an must be amazed to encounter these private matters in a scripture and moral code valid for all mankind and for all time ' (p. 137). God is described with the characteristics of a human being (and this is not mere anthropomorphism) for this is a reflec- tion of Muhammad's own feelings. Actions such as the execution of Banu Quraiza are declared simply ' unjust ' and based on ' inhu- mane principles', including the end justifying the means and the need for expediency regard- less of consistency with spiritual and moral precepts. One could go on and on citing ex- amples of Dashtl's position but this should suffice to make the point clear. Those looking for a particularly thorough- going Shl'ite analysis of Muhammad will be somewhat disappointed. Mufa marriage, for example, is mentioned, but no judgement is given one way or the other. The sources quoted frequently with the aim of ridiculing their absurd fantasies concerning Muhammad, cover the full range of Sunnl, Shlil and European; Tafslr al-Jalalain is probably the most frequently quoted work. Towards the end of the book, when dealing with the problem of suc- cession, the virtues of 'All and the faults of 'Uthman (and the conniving of 'Umar) are clearly emphasized, but this is not the 'All of Sh1'ite mythology; it is the man with all his human faults, just like Muhammad. The Shl'ite notion of the imam, one is led to believe, is the result of the workings of superstitious inadequate minds once again. What does appear, however, is an Iranian emphasis. With the rise of Islam, ' the Arabs did not suddenly lose their materialistic outlook their inability to think in abstract terms, their unconcern with spiritual matters, and their unruliness and obstinacy' (p. 158). The Arabs are responsible for all the ridiculous supersti- tions which grew up around Muhammad and sAll. The Iranians were a far more sophisticated people, but even they eventually fell under the sway of the 'illusions' of the 'weak human mind' (p. 159). They did, however, give Islam its best minds 70% of the principle Arabic works on Islam were written by Iranians, according to Dashtl. It was only after the Iranians ' placed no value on their nationhood and imagined the Hejaz to be the sole source of God's blessing to mankind' (p. 208) that the Iranians fell under the sway of Arab supersti- tion. In translating this book (in an eminently readable way), Bagley has honourably fulfilled a promise he made to Dashtl to do so. How well the work will be received by Iranians today, I am in no position to judge. Clearly, it will speak loudest to the-now largely disaffected group of Iranian intellectuals. For the outsider, the book makes clear the extent of modernism in Iran in the pre-Khumainl period; it is, I suppose, one of</page><page sequence="2">548 REVIEWS the ironies of the situation (in retrospect) tha such a work would have to have been censorez in Iran for fear of its repercussions. A. RIPPIN RICHARD WALZER: Al-Farabi on thl perfect state. Abu Nasr al-Farabl'. Mabadi' ara' ahl al-madlna al fadlla. a revised text with introduc tion, translation and commentary vii, 571 pp. Oxford, Clarendot Press, 1985. ?45. The formal structure of Farabi's Mabadi' ara ahl al-madma al-fadila is both familiar anz elegant. A first section, on metaphysics (chs. i- iii), deals with the unchanging world of intellig ibles. The conceptual centre of this section is thl ' first intelligence', al-'aql al-awwal. A series o other existents derive their being from this on and fall into a natural hierarchical order whosl direction is ' downward ' from the first intelli gence. The second section deals with physics the sublunar world of matter, composition change and decay. Here the conceptual centre i ' first matter ', al-madda al-ula. Other existent materially dependent on this one fall into 4 natural hierarchic order whose direction i ' upward ' and culminates in man (chs. iv-ix) Farabi, though he gives details and clues, doe not, in the end, make clear the relationshi] between these two worlds, for reasons which perhaps, are not too difficult to perceive. (Is firs matter eternal and does it thereby escape th creative activity of the divine being? cf. ch. vi and pp. 372-3.) The third section deals wit] human biology (chs. xi-xii) and psycholog (chs. x, xiii-xiv), concentrating on the highe faculties of the soul and their relationship to th 'active intellect'. Arguably the (teleologica] centre of this discussion lies in the concept o human felicity, saiada man's ultimate perfec tion, a natural fulfilment (istikmat) of hi peculiar position at the highest level of materia things, and his potential to exist free fron matter (ch. xiii, para. 5). Achievement o immaterial felicity is however dependent upo] appropriate political organization which con stitutes the fourth and major section of the wor] (chs. xv-xix). The book achieves a nea circularity when it emerges that the firs criterion of a perfect society is appropriat knowledge of metaphysics, physics and psych ology as set out in the earlier sections of th book. It is immediately clear that this argumen belongs structurally and conceptually to th highly specialized tradition of Greek philosoph which had been mediated to the Arabs from lat antiquity. Farabis though committed to thi philosophical tradition, systematically juxta poses to the philosophical terminology a para] lel terminology derived from the Near Easter theological tradition wherein the concepts anr connotations of God and theodicy were nc easily reconciled with the philosophical trad] tion. This juxtaposition is nowhere mor evident than in ch. xvii which explicitly de scribes the phenomena of diverse religiou systems (milat) as symbolic representation (mithalat) of philosophical truth. Elsewher t Farabi engages in discussion of descriptive I terms (sifat) applied to the first intellect (sic) and the general significance of divine names (asma') (ch. i and ii) thereby participating in a well- established philosophical/theological discussion (for which, see Wolfson, The philosophy of the &gt; Kalam, Cambridge, Mass. 1976, ch. ii). Farabi also in this work allows the theological term Allah to encroach on the philosophical concept * of al-'aql al-awwal, and he clearly indicates the identity of the active intellect (al-'aql al-fa"al) with the notion of the Holy Spirit, ruh al-quds [ (cf. pp. 405-6). In his discussion of the (theo- logical?) concepts of nubuwwa and waky he makes clear his grading of prophetic as opposed ' to philosophical knowledge: the former is only a I symbolic reformulation of the latter, and can - only be correctly understood in the light of the - latter (chs. xiv and xv). Tension between the philosophical and the f theological components in the text is represen- ted in Walzer's commentary by two hypotheses which constitute the structural foundations of - his analysis. One is the hypothesis of specific but unidentifiable Greek sources for the unique or unusual aspects of Farabi's philosophical speculation (Introduction, pp. 9 ff.) Walzer , remains ambivalent about the analytic need for E this postulated source, he almost feels he can date and locate such a source (or sources) to the sixth century A.D. (p. 10; cf. pp. 426 et al.), but cannot quite be sure that Farabi is not himself responsible for the originality of his ideas (or , the original combination and reworking of t established concepts) (p. 12). In his commen- tary Walzer allows play on the 'unknown Platonising predecessor of Farabi' (p. 426) to ^ become a maJor explicative device. This source z repeatedly signalled, remains anonymous: ' a r neo-Platonic predecessor' (p. 432), 'a late Greek predecessor ' (p. 433), ' a previous Greek ) supporter of Plato's views on politics ' (p. 435), f 'the author on whom [Farabi] ultimately - depends' (p. 444) etc. Whether one accepts this s postulate or not, it becomes in the hands of 1 Walzer the commentator a device whereby he 1 opens to his readers the whole world of ancient f Greek philosophy and clarifies the place of this 1 work within that tradition. The second - hypothesis informing Walzer's commentary is &gt; that of specific Imaml Shl'l bias affecting t Farabi's theological and political speculation. t Again, it seems impossible at this stage either to accept or reject this hypothesis; but, again, as an - explicative device, this hypothesis functions as a means whereby Walzer conveys to the reader the peculiarly Muslim constellation of ideas t which constitute the background to Farabi's k thought. 1 It is hardly possible to conceive of a neater ] introduction to Islamic philosophy, and to the s unique tension between philosophy and religion - that marked the Islamic experience, than this - work by Farabi. It is a signal benefit to the 1 world of scholarship that Richard Walzer s devoted to the text, the translation and the t commentary on this work the last years of his - life. Few scholars could hope to achieve the precision and the elegance with which this - native-speaker of German transformed an s Arabic text into his adopted language, English. s Still fewer could match the wide-ranging z informative and constantly stimulating discus-</page></plain_text>
