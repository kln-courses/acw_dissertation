<plain_text><page sequence="1">Calls of the wild 'Strong, rough-edged, brave'... SOPHIE FULLER introduces the disrespectful music of Diana Burrell Sophie Fuller is a lecturer in music at the University of Reading and the author of The Pandora guide to women composers: Britain and the United States, 1629-present (London: Pandora, 1994). 1. Diana Burrell, in Contemporary Music Review, vol.11 (1994), p.55. I loathe all blandness, safe, pale and tasteful niceness. And I detest the cosiness of pastiche, and the safety of too much heritage. Give me instead strong, rough-edged things, brave disrespectful shapes and sounds, imperfect instruments that jangle and jar.1 of commanding works full of passion and energy, primeval wildness and joy. Her music is deeply spiritual but, unlike the other- worldly mysticism of John Taverner or Arvo Part, her spirituality is firmly rooted in the noisy con- fusion of the modern world. Burrell creates music that celebrates the power of transformation and rebirth with the beauty of strange, harsh sounds - from the shrieking birds of Heron for cello and piano (1988) or Gulls and angels for string quartet (1993), through the urban vision of Landscape for orchestra (1988) and the cold, clear soundscapes of Barrow for ensemble (1991) or Dunkelhvide manestraler for contralto, cor anglais and orchestra (1996), to the compellingly visual Resurrection for orchestra (1992) and the more abstract but no less vivid Viola Con- certo ... calling, leaping, crying, dancing... (1994). Born in Norfolk in 1948, Burrell read music at Cambridge, although composition played only a small part in her studies there. After a period teach- ing music in schools, she worked as a free-lance viola player for many years. Essentially self-taught as a composer, she gradually moved away from teach- ing and performing to focus her energies on writing music. Her first work to receive critical attention was the massive and perhaps, for such an early piece, surprisingly self-confident Missa Sancte Endeliente for five soloists, semi-chorus, chorus and orchestra. Written in 1980 for conductor Richard Hickox and the St Endellion Festival in Cornwall, Missa sets the liturgy in both Latin and Cornish with whispers and shouts as well as song. Several aspects of this work, such as the extensive use of percussion and timpani, the clarity of structure or the exuberant breadth of the harmonic language, find resonance in her later music. Perhaps most telling though is the quotation from the French Jesuit mystic Teilhard de Cardin at the end of the score: 'May the universe offer to our gaze the symbols and the forms of all harmony and all beauty'. These are words which could stand as a credo for all Burrell's work. The entire universe, in its man-made as well as its natural aspects, has always been the starting point for her wide-ranging, complex exploration of both harmony and beauty. Since Missa, sacred choral music has continued to play an important, although perhaps unacknowl- edged, part in Burrell's output. Works such as Christo paremus cantica for choir (1993), Heil'ger Geist in's Himmels Throne for choir and organ (1993), Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis for treble voices and organ (1996) and Benedicam Dominum for choir and organ (1996) bring Burrell's strikingly indi- vidual voice to a religious world often content to remain within disappointingly limited musical boundaries. But as well as writing for the Christian church, Burrell is also interested in exploring more pagan aspects of worship and a sense of ritual can be found in much of her music. Another early work, Io Evoe! for chorus, three trumpets, three trombones and strings (1984) uses ancient Gallic and Native American texts to celebrate ceremonial rites of birth, initiation and death. The orchestral work Landscape with procession (1989), commissioned by BBC TV for a series of Easter programmes, was broadcast (as Cry of the cosmos) with images of a Wicker Priestess and an Anglican priest celebrating Mass together in a harsh, bleak landscape. Landscapes are central to Burrell's music, not least in the orchestral work simply called Landscape (1988). Here the listener is in an urban wilderness, combining bird-like calls from the woodwind and dancing rhythmic patterns in the strings with the clanging of metal from a local East London scrap yard and the pervasive sound of steel pans, starkly divorced from their usual calypso setting. The danc- ing patterns gradually disintegrate into threatening rumblings, but the hollow simplicity of two tenor recorders leads the music upwards to a dramatic and triumphant conclusion. Burrell's works often create such evocative journeys through worlds which com- bine the wildness of both nature and the city as well as bringing the world of sound into the realm of the visual. In the string orchestra piece Das Meer das so gross und weit ist, da wimmelt's ohne Zahl, grosse und kleine Tiere (1992) the landscape is in fact a teeming seascape full of energetic rhythms and dark, still places. The work's impossibly long title comes from a Lutheran translation of Psalm 104: '... the great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerate, both great and small beasts...'. The sea, in the tradi- tion of British opera composers such as Ethel Smyth or Benjamin Britten, is also the vital backdrop for Burrell's bleak two-act opera The albatross (1987), based on a novel by Susan Hill. 12 THE MUSICAL TIMES / FEBRUARY 1997</page><page sequence="2">Dunkelhvide manestraler (excerpt) (?

The work was based on a dream of being led through misty early-morning woodland to an ancient burial mound, which responded to the beating of a wooden stick with a frenzy of drumming and then opened to give birth to a pale boy-child in a cradle of twigs. The simple instrumental lines and vital, insistent rhythms create a finely judged sense of mystery and ritual. The theme of birth or rebirth and transformation runs through many of Burrell's works, from Duncan Pike's realisation that he has set himself free at the end of The albatross or the tenor recorders bringing new life up from the bowels of the earth in Landscape to its most explicit depiction in Resurrection (1992). In this orchestral work the cor anglais emerges from the bright, noisy textures of the opening only to be attacked by the swooping bird-like calls and cries of other instruments. After the cor anglais has been silenced the music turns still and frosty with hesi- tant repeated notes from the woodwind, until the cor anglais is resurrected and leads the work to a muted, glistening close. In concept, although not in musical language, Resurrection is perhaps reminis- cent of Elisabeth Lutyens's oboe quintet Driving out the death (1971), both works using the double reed instrument to herald the turning of seasons and mark rituals of life and death. In Creator of the stars of night for choir, cor anglais and organ pedals (1989), Burrell balances her choral writing with the voice of the cor anglais. The instru- ment also plays a central role in another of Burrell's works, the recent Dunkelhvide mdnestraler for con- tralto, cor anglais and orchestra (1996). Burrell often cites Carl Nielsen as a composer whose music has had a great impact on her and she has long been fas- cinated by his native country and culture, even to the extent of learning Danish. In Dunkelhvide mane- striler (which translates as 'Dark-white moonlight') she sets two poems by the Danish poet Tove Dit- levsen.

'News: Burrell' s hymn to joy', in Classic CD (January 1997), p.14. 4. 'It was the lark, the herald of the morn' (Act 3 sc.5). Romeo and Juliet's lark is unwelcome in signalling the end of their wedding night or as Juliet puts it: 'It is the lark that sings so out of tune / Straining harsh dischords and, unpleasing sharps. / Some say the lark makes sweet divi- sion: / This doth not so, for she divideth us...'. welcome the idea of death (Ditlevsen herself com- mitted suicide in 1976) with haunting simplicity: I want to die one winter's night like this, When the gentle snow is silent as stardust, And the white earth, cold and beautiful, Will never more slip from my hands. I shall not offend the night with my weeping. Only the moon-white snow will known what to do, And can grant me the peace I desire.2 The intensely virtuosic cor anglais part, using char- acteristic keening cries, blends a basic tone colour with that of the singer while finding a darker agony behind Ditlevsen's words that is perhaps best expressed by wordless music. The use of inventive, perfectly judged sonorities is one of the most immediately remarkable things about Burrell's music. She often demands extremes of register and technique from her players while, as a musician with many years of performing behind her, never making the music unrewarding to play. In Dunkelhvide manestrdler the cor anglais seems some- times stretched almost to breaking point while the Viola Concerto (1994) certainly fulfills dedicatee Jane Atkins's request that Burrell make the viola part as difficult as possible.3 Several works demand the use of quarter-tones or note clusters that focus on texture and sonority rather than pitch. Untuned per- cussion instruments are very important in Burrell's works, particularly those making bell-like, metallic sounds. But she also makes impressive use of tuned percussion instruments, as in the pivotal drumming of the guitarist and cellist in Barrow or the timpani solo at the opening of the Credo of Missa Sancte Endelliente. Burrell also writes for unexpected instruments such as the basset horns of The albatross or the steel pans, pieces of scrap metal and eerie tenor recorders of Landscape. Combinations and doublings of instruments also produce striking effects, such as the opening duet of Barrow for horn and high-register bassoon. The long, fluid opening clarinet line of the Clarinet Concerto (1996) is at times doubled by the orchestral violins at exactly the same pitch. In an earlier clarinet piece, Bright herald of the morning for clarinet and piano (1992), Burrell 14 THE MUSICAL TIMES / FEBRUARY 1997</page><page sequence="4">had used a right hand piano line to echo and double the clarinet. In this work the two hands of the piano often seem to work as separate instruments, a device that can also be seen in an earlier duo, Heron for cello and piano (1988) which opens with resonating low strings in the piano struck by the performer's hand and a stick. The cello's line of recitative is then interrupted and supported with motifs and patterns from the right hand of the piano playing at the high- est, almost unpitched extreme of the instrument. Heron was inspired by the movement of herons' wings in the open spaces near Burrell's London home - the Hackney Marshes and the local park. Her musical landscapes are always full of birds, often swooping, crying, shrieking wind instruments as in Landscape and Resurrection. Even a seemingly more abstract work such as the Wind Quintet (1990) opens with unmistakable Burrell bird calls. A less aggressive but still perhaps unwelcome bird is found in the title of Bright herald of the morning with its ref- erence to the lark of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.4 Burrell's birds are rarely the tuneful, meditative birds that can be heard in the music of a composer such as Olivier Messiaen. In her string quartet Gulls and angels (1993) the squawking stringed gulls are set against the balance and calm of the angels' music. But, as is reflected in so many of her works, such harshness is a necessary part of Burrell's world and of her vision of beauty. She has written: 'In reality, our universe is only just ordered by the angels. It is so taut and finely measured - and so easily shattered by the gulls. How bad for us, how complacent we would all be if it were not so.'5 When they are not representing birds or other almost identifiable beings such as the stringed sea creatures of Das Meer, the anthropomorphic cor ang- lais of Resurrection, or the abundant life forms of her latest orchestral work Symphonies of flocks, herds and shoals (1996),6 Burrell's instruments are still strong- ly dramatic. The subtitle of the Viola Concerto, ... calling, leaping, crying, dancing..., indicates the hu- man impulse behind the music and Burrell has said of the work: 'I like to think of it as a human piece - the viola is a sort of human character going through all these different moods...'.7 In the orchestral work Enchainements (1994) six soloists (violin, viola, two oboes and two horns) move in and out of a per- forming space at the front of the stage as they form different musical relationships with each other. This characterisation of instruments and the reinforcing of musical interaction with physical movement on the stage recalls Thea Musgrave's 'dramatic-abstract' music of the late 1960s although Burrell's work is much less combatative than, for instance, Musgrave's Night music (1969) or Horn Concerto (1971). The title Enchainements refers not only to the ballet term for a linked chain of steps but also to the general idea of linking and connecting. This is an important concept for Burrell who sees her Viola Concerto, for example, as being a work that expresses communal- ity 'rather than a confrontational kind of concerto.'8 Diana Burrell (Photo Eric Richmond) Burrell's use of the visual and dramatic in her music is reflected in the way she composes, blocking out the clear forms of her music as visual shapes - something she has related to architecture: 'I am fas- cinated by strong and beautiful new buildings, and indeed to begin with, I often approach the composi- tion of my pieces as visual structures on plain white paper. My music, like a building, has to make a clean, bold shape on the skyline.'9 The forms of her music are always as distinctly defined and audible as these origins would suggest, whether they are the four contrasting sections of the Viola Concerto, the prelude and fugue of Das Meer, or the repeated lines of a smaller piece such as Heron. In later works such as Dunkelhvide mdnestrdler or the Clarinet Concerto the building blocks may be less sharply distin- guished but they are still present, supporting her often complex and dissonant harmonies and playing an important part in the ease with which Burrell's music communicates with her listener. Burrell has spoken out against the contemporary trend for 'user-friendly' music which relies on pas- tiche or basic tonal harmonies to produce immedi- 5.

' M, C 0 L .L E G EWa-'IMMan APPOINTMENT OF GRESHAM PROFESSOR OF MUSIC The Council of Gresham College invites applications from women and men who wish to be considered for appointment as Gresham Professor of Music, or nominations of candidates of appropriate standing who might be approached. The appointment will take effect in September 1997. Gresham College was established in 1597 under the Will of Sir Thomas Gresham as an independent educational institution. It supports pro- grammes of free public lectures in the disciplines provided for under the terms of Gresham's bequest and seeks to interpret the 'new learning' of Gresham's day in contemporary terms. It particularly seeks to involve those who live and work in the City of London in intellectual debate. The College would be especially interested in persons involved with composition and/or teaching, who would focus on the development of con- temporary music, its performance and its dissemination. The ability to include demonstrations or performances as part of the lecture programme would be a major asset. The appointment will be for three years. The principal obligation is to offer six lectures each year. Opportunities exist for support to be given to research activities in which the Professor is involved. An annual fee of ?3,750 (inc VAT) is payable.

Using clearly defined forms, complex rhythmic pat- terns, dazzling sonorities and atonal harmonies her music is never 'easy-listening' and yet always man- ages to communicate directly with both performer and listener. She has written: 'I want to attempt the impossible, and find a musical language that works at all levels, and for all people, and is of today.'l1 Burrell always treats her performers with respect, leaving them to work out many performing details. Her scores usually indicate that bowings, pedal- marks and additional phrasing are to be added as necessary while other markings are straight forward and direct: 'bold and warm', 'brilliant and strong', 'smooth and sustained'. She has taken her belief in the need to create modern works for all kinds of musicians into the educational field and is particu- larly involved with COMA (Contemporary Music Making for Amateurs). Her works for young and amateur performers are never patronisingly simple and always written in her own language with no toning down of harmonic idiom. They include Scene with birds (1989) for Norfolk County Youth Orches- tra, the choral and instrumental Lights and shadows (1989) for London's Centre for Young Musicians and the string orchestra work Anima (1993) for COMA. N LESS THAN twenty years Diana Burrell has achieved the kind of success that often evades the contemporary British composer. She has a steady stream of prestigious commissions and has worked closely with many different performing groups including a period as Composer-in- Association with the City of London Sinfonia (for whom she wrote both Enchainements and Dunkelhvide mdnestr&amp;ler). Her music is published by United Music Publishers, frequently broadcast and the Northern Sinfonia has devoted an entire CD to a selection of representative orchestral works.12 Although she is probably best known for her orches- tral music, the recent premiere of Dunkelhvide manestrdler and the long-awaited premiere of The albatross this year13 should bring her to wider atten- tion as a composer of dramatic vocal music. The visual and dramatic qualities of her music, coupled with her skill at communicating emotions and ideas would seem to point the way towards greater explo- ration of the possibilities of music drama and opera. Composers who have something to say and the means with which to say it are rare. Burrell's late start and relative lack of formal training as a com- poser seem only to have helped her find a distinctive voice with which to celebrate and perhaps to change the complexities of today's confused and confusing world. 10.
