<plain_text><page sequence="1">Autumn 2007 : Review Article Evil, God, the greater good and rights: the philosophical origins of social problems, by Bryan Fanning, New York and Lampeter : Edwin Mellon, 2007, pp.232 It is a truism in philosophy that many ideas whose truth and goodness appear to be self-evident have long and sometimes tortuous histories. Their putative immediacy is the result of a process, and it is often claimed that the content as well as the form of the process needs to be made explicit. A relatively recent and notable example of this genealogical approach is Charles Taylor's Sources of the Self, in which it is shown that the modern notion of what it is to be a self or person or human agent can be traced back to Locke, Augustine and Plato.1 This approach has been associated most famously and notoriously with Hegel and Nietzsche. It does of course run the risk of suggesting that a genetic explanation is equivalent to a comprehensive justification or refutation, but it has the advantage of turning up assumptions that were involved in the formation of this or that concept. For the critical practitioner of this approach, the development and reformulation of a notion can be shown to run in part with arguments that emerged historically as responses to objections. What are also revealed are the unacknowledged premises that never received argumentative support. Such an approach is found in much of Bryan Fanning's book. He is concerned with showing how diverse beliefs and debates about human nature and the human condition continue to be informed heavily by ontologies or theories of Being, each of which is nested in a certain 328 Studies ? volume 96 ? number 383</page><page sequence="2">Autumn 2007 : Review Article metaphysics. Already manifested by the ancients in explicit theory as well as implicit background belief, metaphysics comprises a general understanding of why things are as well as how they are. Fanning's major concern, however, is not genetic or genealogical. He blends this approach with sociological analyses in order to show how beliefs matter, even in - and indeed especially in - the secular west. They matter because social, institutional and bureaucratic practices embody ontological and metaphysical views in their conventions and rules about what material 'facts' are taken as relevant or irrelevant, and about which people and groups are judged deserving or undeserving of safety, asylum, citizenship and care. Fanning's work, as I understand it, finds its crucial inspiration in Isaiah Berlin's remarks, cited below, that questions about what it is to be deemed human or 'sub-human' are more than empirical questions, and that their philosophical content goes far beyond the mere examination of language and linguistic usage. Throughout its pages, the reader finds that this book takes seriously Berlin's most serious point, which is that people's lives depended on, and still depend on, these very questions. They are never trivial ones. The concrete influence of these questions is clearly illustrated in Fanning's interlinked case studies, beginning with a consideration of the thought and the enduring legacy of Augustine of Hippo. We are shown the instrumental character of his conception of charity, in which helping the less fortunate is a means of bringing the donor closer to God, and reminded of his influence on Calvinism and the Protestant ethic through the ideas of original sin and predestination. These ideas would emerge again in the punitive treatments of the 'undeserving poor' in the nineteenth century. Augustine was most troubled by the existence of evil, seeing the loss of heavenly salvation as the worst of all fates. Earthly society and codes of justice could never remedy evil, but could curb sinfulness through a 'rough justice' that instils the fear of immediate punishment. His notions of society and state have coloured the c?mmunitarian and authoritarian 'moral majority' view that selfish individualism needs to be limited for the common good, and his significance for Kant is revealed by comparing the latter's ethical yet earthly commonwealth with the former's City of God. Studies ? volume 96 ? number 383 329</page><page sequence="3">Autumn 2007 : Review Article The chapter on Aquinas and modernity demonstrates how Thomas's Christianisation of Aristotle emphasised the importance of reason and experience, giving the earthly realm a status it has lacked in the Platonic cosmology of Augustine. Faith in doctrinal orthodoxy and obedience to a universal church were nonetheless of paramount importance to Aquinas. Building further on Aristotle's teleological approach, he formulated a natural law theory that was enlisted in support of centralised Church authority. Fanning brings out the conservative side of Aquinas' thought that was appropriated by neo-Thomism and anti-Modernism, as seen in the doctrine of infallibility and Papal encyclicals that forwarded hierarchical and corporatist rather than socialist solutions to the excesses of capitalism. The thirteenth century was taken as the panacea for the ills of modernity. Yet there is a critical and elastic side to Aquinas' thinking, notes Fanning, which has found more recent expressions. Jacques Maritain set out a Christian humanism that rejected communism, totalitarianism and racism due to their neglect of the dignity of the person. Showing how Aquinas could be used in the development of rights theory, Maritain's ideas fed into the post-Vatican II emphasis on social justice, and prefigured the activist liberation theology that emerged in the 1960's and 1970's. In Fanning's succinct study of witch trials and bureaucracies, attention is drawn to two official realities. One emerged during and after the Second Crusade, and was directed at the perceived enemies of Christendom within the gate, as it were. The other is the modern rationalist bureaucracy that creates and maintains secular orthodoxies and itself secures the assimilation, exclusion or even destruction of out-groups. Witch trials and bureaucracies are concerned intrinsically with the classification and sorting of human beings. The first employed trials and inquisitions to control religious deviants and centralise church authority. For most of the Middle Ages, Augustine's views of evil as an absence of good and of witchcraft as mythological were prevalent. It was Aquinas who helped facilitate the literal belief in witchcraft, claiming that demons can be called on to intervene in the material world. Whilst holding that unbelievers must not be converted forcibly, he also contended that those who had accepted the faith must be compelled by force to hold their initial orthodoxy. To corrupt 330 Studies ? volume 96 ? number 383</page><page sequence="4">Autumn 2007 : Review Article faith should be a capital offence, as the counterfeiting of money was already. Max Weber identified bureaucracies as central to the development of modernity. The drive for efficiency and predictive accuracy in all things that was inspired by the scientific revolution enclosed people in an iron cage of instrumental rationality and disenchanted the world, stripping it of whatever could not be calculated, quantified and administered mechanistically. The Weberian account was developed further by the Frankfurt School theorists, who observed that many philosophers in the middle of the twentieth century had limited their own discipline to the analysis of linguistic facts. Weber's ideas have been used more recently by George Ritzer and Zygmunt Bauman. Fanning draws on Bauman's thesis that twentieth century genocide ensued from the application of modern rational techniques to unresolved tensions and conflicts from the pre-modern era. It is not enough to point to presumptive pathologies within modernity, since the goals that are set for instrumental systems are rooted in ontological understanding of the world and of human nature. Modern dehumanisation calls upon an older view that evil is most strongly facilitated by and embodied in particular human beings and groups. The question of the welfare of individuals and groups is bound up intimately with that of the good of society as a whole, and this relationship is examined in the next chapter. The terms of the debate were largely set by Kant, who argued that the only thing that is good without qualification is a good will, which in its human instantiation acts rationally from duty alone, subordinating its particular ends to absolute and universal moral principles. Truly moral actions are what people would always perform in an ideal kingdom of ends. Kant did not think that such an ideal could be attained, but was optimistic enough to think that it could be approximated to in a future society. Informed by the work of Isaiah Berlin, Fanning shows how the notion of a kingdom of ends was appropriated by Marx and even by Mill (for all of the other differences between the utilitarian and deontological positions). The notion was criticised by Frederick Hayek, who contended that the very idea of progress towards a greater good rests on the anthropomorphic presumption that a social order can have a Studies ? volume 96 ? number 383 331</page><page sequence="5">Autumn 2007 : Review Article purpose. This presumption can easily ensue in a tyrannical teleology that deifies society at large. Yet Hayek himself draws one-sidedly on Adam Smith, reducing the individual to an economic actor who should live in a system of free market exchange. A notable and contemporary defender of the kingdom of ends is John Rawls, whose reformulation of a Kantian theory of justice and the good society responds to Hayek's critique. A reconstructed metaphysics of welfare survives the presumptive elimination of metaphysics and the public good. In a world of complex interdependencies, as Fanning writes, arguments about the greater good will run and run. So too will debates concerning the ontological status of the laws that govern such interdependencies. His treatment of the role of metaphysics and ontology in jurisprudence highlights the persistent cleavage between a view of law and rights in natural and moral terms and an empirical, positivist perspective that views them as a system of rules. Quarrels within the natural law and natural rights tradition received a new urgency with the conquest of the 'new world.' Some theorists saw in the natural law tradition a justification of natural slavery. Others, including Bartlome de Las Casas, argued that the native Indians were intrinsically free peoples. Conquest and colonization could receive no justification by way of a false antithesis between forcibly converted slaves who would attain eternal salvation and the so-called license of heathens. John Locke's influential theory of law and rights included natural and positive elements, stressing the necessity of reasoned consent to authority, the primacy of divinely decreed natural rights, and a return to the Aristotelian view that some humans do not count as persons with rights. Paine and the abolitionists also drew on the natural tradition, but Fanning observes that the very idea of natural rights was disputed in the nineteenth century, theistic beliefs in rights coming to the fore just as these beliefs were losing philosophical credibility. Bentham argued that natural rights are nonsense on stilts, and for legal positivists there are no other norms than the laws that society has put in place, and which therefore have a positive existence. H.L.A. Hart wrote within this tradition, but pointed out that teleologica! premises are latent in some of the ways we think and 332 Studies ? volume 96 ? number 383</page><page sequence="6">Autumn 2007 : Review Article speak about people. It is not necessary to believe in divinely or antecedently fixed ends or goals to accept a 'minimum content natural law' that reconstructs ends and goals as useful norms for individual and collective welfare. For Ronald Dworkin, even this reconstructive account contains redundant metaphysical remnants. Rights found in positive law do not reset on ontological assumptions, for they are nothing but special judgements about what it is right or wrong for governments to do. Fanning proceeds deftly to outline criticisms of the natural and positive approaches, both of which have been mobilised for repressive and totalitarian ends. He also refers to problems that persist in the UN Declaration of Universal Rights that emerged as a response to genocides. John Finnis has adverted to the lack of a formula for distinguishing rights from obligations, and Hannah Arendt identified one of the most practical and poignant problems with human rights, namely, the absence of a right to rights. Survivors of the Holocaust were acutely aware that human rights depend on membership of a state, and on what states will do for people. A milder, but hardly encouraging, instance was seen in the enlargement of the European Union. Right of access from the new states was granted, yet many original member states reduced the legal rights of migrants to social welfare. And the lack of legal status for non-Western refugees and immigrants may be a step to another and much harsher reality. The ideas of compassion and charity, inherited from the Greek and Judeo-Christian tradition of Augustine ef a/, were already rejected by Nietzsche. In these notions he espied a reactive and regressive extolling of weakness and renunciation. In his last chapter, Fanning reliably steers us through the contentions, formulated by Nietzsche and taken up most recently by Richard Rorty, that fierce intolerance and ruthless pragmatism are the necessary consequences of rigorous thinking about matters ontological. Dismissing eternal and immutable verities as forcefully as the existence of God, Nietzsche saw the avoidance of pain and suffering as impeding self-creation and self-overcoming. His Overman' would instantiate strength, vitality and will, creating new values without pious and metaphysical appeals to a mythic higher reality with its divine guarantor. Fanning notes that, at one juncture, Nietzsche set aside his antipathy to Studies ? volume 96 * number 383 333</page><page sequence="7">Autumn 2007 : Review Article democracy, praising the American polity for its faith in the individual who is convinced that he can do almost anything and play any role, improvising, experimenting and creating with an unprecedented audacity. Rorty draws as much from Nietzsche, notes Fanning, as from earlier pragmatists like Pierce, James, and Dewey. According to Rorty, Nietzsche's self-transcendence finds its equivalence in the collective yet pluralistic self-creation of American liberal democracy. The anti metaphysical American spirit knows that inherited values can be abandoned once their utility is exhausted. It avoids the calcified norms of religious fundamentalism or left social democracy. In Rorty's picture, liberal democracy in its American form must be seen as superior to other societies and polities. Cultural ethnocentrism and ontological intolerance are the only coherent options for the committed liberal. On this view, solidarity or agreement with one's community is far preferable to objectivity, or agreement about how things are. Rorty wants to discourage people from strongly holding moral positions on issues like abortion, preferring a consensus that is as flexible and wishy-washy as possible. The denizens of his liberal democracy are to value democratic consensus more than virtually anything else. Unsurprisingly, but not without justification, such a pragmatic and minimalist liberalism is one of Fanning's major targets. It is difficult to dismiss his claim that the effective relegation of religious, metaphysical and moral positions to the private sphere can hardly be described as pluralistic, though Rorty is admittedly writing against a back drop of religious revivalism, and does not wish to disenchant politics by bracketing morality and religion thoroughly. Though Rorty seeks to distance his ethnocentrism of liberal democracy from colonial variants that appeal to reason, God or natural superiority, Fanning argues forcefully that this distinction breaks down in practical terms. Like xenophobia and racism, ethnocentrism in all its forms has a metaphysical element, being predicated on a priori beliefs about the intrinsic nature or character of all groups defined as Other.' We are reminded of Berlin's remarks that pluralism is not a willingness to surrender one's values, but an unwillingness to forget that, for others, their values are objective expressions of their humanity. We are further reminded 334 Studies ? volume 96 ? number 383</page><page sequence="8">Autumn 2007 : Review Article of Emile Durkheim's emphasis on the need to study the 'recognised truths' of other societies, to find out why they are accepted and how they underpin social cohesion in those societies. It is made abundantly evident by Fanning that he is not advocating a facile dismissal of Nietzschean and pragmatic positions. What he shows instead, and with notable success, is the survival and even revival of metaphysical constructions within forms of thinking that claim to have overcome earlier philosophies. It is one thing to extol the self transcendence of individuals and collectives, and quite another to do this without calling unto ontology and essentialism in the service of one's alternative. Here one remembers Heidegger's argument that the Nietzschean valuation of transience and becoming against the eternal and immutable being of Platonism privileges reactively the hitherto neglected terms of unquestioned metaphysical oppositions. Beliefs still matter in the secular West, especially because people's lives depend on them, especially because technology can realise many of their consequences with remarkable rapidity, and especially because their metaphysical roots can exert a quiet influence without interference when hidden under the gloss of post-metaphysical and anti-foundationalist thinking. If we have witnessed the death of God in modernity, it is the singular virtue of Bryan Fanning's book to show us that this has not been accompanied by the disappearance of the categories - no doubt metaphysical - of the elect and the damned.
