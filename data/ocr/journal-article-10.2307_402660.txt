<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER HASENCLEVER'S SATIRIC TREATMENT OF RELIGION Alfred Hoelzel Walter Hasenclever's reputation as a writer has rested almost entirely on his contribution to German literary Expressionism. One tends to think of the Expressionist drama and poetry which earned him the first Kleist Prize in 1917, notably the plays Der Sohn, that revolutionary manifesto of youth in conflict with its elders, and Antigone, a provocative anti-war polemic. Literary historians have virtually ignored his subsequent accomplishments as a journalist and satirist. As a result critical assessment of Hasenclever has remained one-sided and incomplete. Not long ago it was a convenient and fairly common practice to call an author an Expressionist with little further amplification. But the scholarship of recent years, particularly the work of Walter Sokel,1 has shown us that Expressionism was by no means a monolithic phenomenon, that its multifaceted nature derived in fact from the diverse motives and interests of its writers, culminating in their dissimilar, even diametrically opposed, later developments. Thus one can no more claim to know Hasenclever solely on the basis of his Ex- pressionist works-he wrote Der Sohn and Antigone in his twenties- than one can appraise such former Expressionists as Benn, Becher, Werfel, and Johst without taking into account their later writings. Hasenclever's post-Expressionist career evinces both consistent continuity and radical change. Ever present is the iconoclasm, the attack on shallow values, the unmasking of hypocrisy and prejudice, all of which had been so characteristic of his earlier work, but his tone and style change radically. Instead of giving vent to his feelings in emotionally charged, polemical dramas and poems, Hasenclever now resorts to satire and caricature to ridicule those aspects of human failing and moral negligence which had always aroused his ire. Fre- quently the satire is biting and destructive, but just as often the tone is gentle and chiding, as though the author were merely poking good- natured fun at human foibles. The most important Zeitstiicke (i.e., comedies dealing critically with contemporary issues) which Hasenclever wrote between 1925 and his death in 1940 are Ein besserer Herr, Ehen werden im Himmel geschlossen, Napoleon greift ein, and the still unpublished though already performed "Konflikt in Assyrien." These are not his only 59</page><page sequence="2">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY comedies, but they are the ones in which he expressed most keenly, albeit in satiric form, his criticism of some major issues. The purpose of this article is to concentrate on one of these issues, religion, and to analyze Hasenclever's treatment of it. Because Ehen werden im Himmel geschlossen is the play which makes religion a dominant theme, it is properly the locus for understanding Hasenclever's attitude towards religion and clarifies his occasional use of religious themes in other works. Having been rewarded in 1926 with both critical acclaim and financial success for his first social satire, Ein besserer Herr-a work which, incidentally, still enjoys considerable popularity on the German stage and television-Hasenclever continued to work in this genre and two years later produced Ehen werden im Himmel geschlossen. The angry reaction which Ehen aroused in certain German Christian circles made it one of the most controversial plays of the decade, bringing its author as much prominence as he had attained some years earlier with Der Sohn and Antigone. Church authorities were appalled not only by Hasenclever's humorous treatment of Christian beliefs but even more by his iconoclastic presentation of God and several saints in the form of human beings with rather unsaintly, mundane qualities. Indignant articles by spokesmen of the Church appeared everywhere; enraged divinity students appeared at performances to hurl missiles at the innocent actors; and in Berlin, Weimar, and Frankfurt the angry clergy tried to initiate lawsuits against Hasenclever and performances of Ehen on the charge of blasphemy-but without success. Hasenclever's opponents were indeed able to force a trial two years later in Vienna. Because Hasenclever was a German citizen and there- fore immune from prosecution they had to content themselves with a suit only against the actors. But Hasenclever could not view such an action with indifference. In characteristic fashion he wrote to the lawyer handling the case and asserted that he himself was entirely responsible for the work, and under no circumstances must the actors be held accountable. After a trial which was not without its amusing features, the court found the actors guilty, not of defaming God, but of disturbing the peace! That Hasenclever, an iconoclast and an antagonist of bourgeois values, offended the feelings of orthodox Christians in Ehen is not entirely surprising. But it is misleading to say, as Wilhelm Knevels did in a discussion of the work, that Hasenclever was a Feuerbachian atheist.2 60</page><page sequence="3">HASENCLEVER'S TREATMENT OF RELIGION As a boy Hasenclever had been raised in the Lutheran faith of his family. At an early age he already underwent an experience which temporarily shook his faith in the justice of God, whose mercy and kindness, he had been taught, were infinite: It happened that the ten- year-old Walter once deliberately avoided paying his fare on a public vehicle in order to have some extra spending money. But his conscience would not let him rest; he felt that he had committed a damnable sin, and he desperately wanted to atone for his act. Remorsefully he beat his head against the bedpost in his room; if only God would give some sign that He had accepted his penance! But no such sign appeared. Why, thought the boy, is God silent? Why does He not help? He fell on his knees and begged for forgiveness. What more could he do? And he thought: "Welch eine schreckliche Priifung ist diese Welt! Wenn Gottes Kinder so hart gestraft werden, dann muB man an seiner Gerechtigkeit zweifeln. Und Gerechtigkeit ist etwas, was in meinem kindlichen Herzen fest und unverriickbar steht. Wenn dieser Felsen wankt, will ich nicht mehr leben."3 Hasenclever was concerned with justice from his earliest youth. If there was an all-powerful God, then it was His first responsibility to see that justice was done. Any deviation from Hasenclever's concept of perfect fairness gave him reason to doubt the perfection of the traditional God. By the time Hasenclever had become a university student he had completely outgrown orthodoxy. Ample proof for this can be found in his report of a dinner-table discussion with a professor of theology. Though but a young student at the time, he brazenly attacked orthodox Christianity as a religion of "Verdunklung," which, rather than con- tributing to peace and brotherhood, had caused the shedding of much blood. The Christian religion, he charged, has historically been asso- ciated with power. Jesus was a communist, who talked about the hereafter only because He could find little comfort in this world. His heaven was a savings bank where good deeds drew interest (IuL, pp. 20-23). Hasenclever's first published work, Nirwana, contains considerable evidence of his opposition to formal Christianity. It portrays one of the characters, Pastor Call, as a hypocrite; he is not truthful with members of his congregation, he would not stop at destroying another man's reputation to protect his own, and he exhibits a narrow intolerance toward an unfortunate young girl who has been seduced. The play con- tains several pointed remarks against the established concepts of in- stitutionalized religion. The pastor, privately a liberal, says: "Ein 61</page><page sequence="4">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY jeder, meine ich, der die Dinge scharf und nachdenklich priift, wird zu der Erkenntnis kommen, daB die Grenzen einer Konfession zu eng sind. Dafiir heiBt sie eben Konfession. Wir miissen einfach dariiber hinaus wachsen."4 One of the other principals in the play is equally critical of religious dogma: "Am Ende haben alle Gesetze und Notwendigkeiten das gleiche Schicksal: Solange besteht ihre Giiltigkeit, bis einer kommt und beweist, daB man gerade so gut und noch besser ohne sie fertig wird."5 Hasenclever's unorthodox views on the Church and on organized religion did not change significantly thereafter, not even during his Expressionist period. The fact is that while the Expressionists pursued their goals with a fervor bordering on religious conviction, their religious views, generally speaking, were unorthodox and untraditional. To most Expressionists, worship of God meant striving after the highest ethical ideals in one's conduct towards his neighbor. Thus, when Kasimir Edschmid wrote that Expressionism was based on "Liebe, Gott, Gerechtigkeit," he added that its religious aspect was of a kind "die iiber Konfessionelles hin [italics mine] das letzte, das streng gerichtet Rechte will."6 A fairly representative voice of the Expressionists, that of Kurt Pinthus, can be heard on this topic in a long essay entitled "Rede fur die Zukunft."7 Here Pinthus praises the founders of various re- ligions, Moses, Jesus, and Buddha, because they fought against the status quo in order to improve the lot of man. Pinthus attacks, however, the later developments in these religions, i.e., the inflexible dogma and conventions which eventually assumed greater importance than ethical principles. Hasenclever's Expressionist works evince analogous attitudes to- wards religion. Der Retter and Antigone use religious motifs and invoke God to underscore the pacifist message central to both plays. On the other hand the Church and its clergy, symbols of formal Christianity, are bitterly denounced in one of the essays in Der politische Dichter for what Hasenclever feels is their hypocritical at- titude toward the waging of war.8 Furthermore a devastating scene in Die Menschen portrays a minister refusing to continue with a funeral ceremony when he realizes he will not get paid.9 As the Expressionist era passed, Hasenclever turned with increasing interest to the study of mysticism, to Eastern philosophies (especially to Buddhism) and to the writings of Swedenborg. He became increasingly convinced that the universe is subject not to a transcendental God in the Judeo-Christian sense but to a preordained cosmic scheme. His 62</page><page sequence="5">HASENCLEVER'S TREATMENT OF RELIGION two autobiographical novels testify frequently to his belief in "das Zwangsliufige kosmischer Ereignisse." Both novels make it clear that Hasenclever's Weltanschauung did not include a Deity who controlled at will the machinery of the universe, who was able to change or interrupt the flow of life. For Hasenclever the world functioned on the basis of immutable immanent forces over which no being, either human or divine, had any control. Nowhere in Hasenclever's writings is this view more clearly manifest than in Ehen werden im Himmel geschlossen. Two main ideas underlie Ehen: first, the concept that life proceeds along an ineluctably preordained path, not to be altered even by God, and second, the satiric treatment of institutionalized religion as repre- sented by Christianity. Because the second of these elements is so conspicuous, the former has been ignored by the critics. But as Hasen- clever himself wrote in a letter: "Der Sinn meiner Kom6die ist, man kann an das Schicksal nicht riihren. Sogar Gott kann nichts dagegen machen, daf3 ihn die Menschen nach ihrem Bilde erschaffen haben. Deshalb lIaBt er es lachelnd geschehen."'0 Hasenclever posits the supremacy of fate in the universe im- mediately at the beginning of the play. Ironically it is God who is Hasenclever's spokesman, as he tries to convince the others that the traditional conceptions of God and religion are quite outmoded and serve nowadays merely as a pretext for the ulterior motives of un- scrupulous and unenlightened human beings. Der liebe Gott: Ich habe es satt. Seit vielen Jahren sitze ich auf diesem imaginiiren Thron, auf den mich ein allgemeines, mensch- liches Plebiszit erhoben hat. Man beschuldigt mich, das Weltall geschaffen zu haben, und macht mich fur seine Schwachen und Unvollkommenheiten verantwortlich. Der Fall liegt umgekehrt. Die Menschen haben mich erschaffen. Unfiihig, sich selbst zu regieren und ohne Illusionen zu leben, haben sie in mir ein h6chstes Wesen verkorpert, das ihren Bediirfnissen entspricht .... Man hat die Notwendigkeit meiner Existenz so oft bewiesen, da3 ich fast daran glaube. Ich mache gute Miene zum bosen Spiel. Ich regiere. Ich sitze hier oben, empfange, unterschreibe Akten, lasse mich interviewen und malen. Meine Person dient als Vorwand fur die diimmsten Anspriiche der Menschen. Kriege werden in meinem Namen begonnen und Revolutionen gegen mich gefuhrt. Sie machen aus mir, was sie wollen. (Pp. 262-263) In view of this state of affairs God wants to resign. When the saints are horrified at this suggestion, God reassures them that such an act would have absolutely no effect. 63</page><page sequence="6">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Der liebe Gott: Mein lieber Petrus, es wird sich gar nichts andern. So wie sich seit Beginn der Welt nie etwas geandert hat. Sieh dir mal die Menschen an. Sie sind nicht besser und nicht kliiger geworden. Sie sind genau so, wie sie sind. Das ist das Geheimnis. Alles andere ist Philosophie, Literatur, Schwindel. Man behauptet von mir, ich habe die Macht, in das Schicksal der Menschen einzugreifen. Welcher Irrtum! Ich habe es nie getan. Ich wiirde es auch nicht tun, selbst wenn ich es konnte. Das Schicksal ist das Gleichgewicht der Welt. Daran riihren nur Irrsinnige oder Verbrecher. Alles kommt, wie es kommen muf. (P. 263) These last lines contain the essence of Hasenclever's message on the immutability of natural events. The rest of the play constitutes the proof of God's statements. A messenger announcing the arrival of three recent suicides interrupts the discussion between God and the saints. Each of these suicides happened quite independently, but all three were caused by the same malady: unrequited love. Mary Magdalen, the heavenly expert for such matters, judges that each of these people was driven to suicide by unfortunate circumstances. She is sure that if they were restored to life under new conditions, each one would find the happiness that had previously eluded him. She requests God to restore the three to life in a relationship so arranged as to ensure their mutual compatibility. Thus the fifty-year-old Felix, who had loved in vain for many years, should be married to Renee, who could not make up her mind between two men. And the young student, Tonio, who had been in love with another man's wife, should now become Renee's lover-with the full approval of the mature, understanding Felix. At first God refuses: "Ich kann in die ewige Ordnung nicht eingreifen" (p. 265). But Magdalen is so insistent and pleads so fervently for the happiness which these three people could enjoy in their new lives that God finally accedes to her wishes. Unfortunately matters do not turn out as Magdalen had forecast. The second act finds Felix, Renee, and Tonio stranded on a lonely road following a breakdown in their car. Felix goes off to seek help, and before long Tonio and Renee exchange warm embraces. But Tonio is still unsatisfied because Renee loves both Felix and him. When Tonio confesses his possessive love for Renee to the returned Felix, the latter generously declares himself willing to let Renee go off with Tonio, for he is sure that she will return to him sooner or later. Tonio realizes the truth of Felix's words and, unable to face reality, shoots himself. 64</page><page sequence="7">HASENCLEVER'S TREATMENT OF RELIGION Overwrought because of Tonio's suicide, Renee takes the wheel of the repaired car and deliberately crashes it at high speed, killing herself and Felix. Mary Magdalen tries to excuse the failure of her plan. She pleads with God to return all three to earth once more-but in a new relationship. This time Tonio should be the husband and Felix the lover. Furthermore, Magdalen suggests, the three should now be poor working people rather than comfortable aristocrats. As working people they will appreciate life more, she thinks, for they will not be spoiled with the ennui of a luxurious existence. Once again God reluctantly follows Magdalen's instructions. But her plan is no more successful this time. Tonio proves to be a jealous and vicious husband, much to the disgust of the kindly Felix. Before long the two men are involved in a mortal struggle which is only halted by the sudden appearance of God as the Kommerzienrat of the mine where both Felix and Tonio work. God is accompanied by Magdalen and St. Peter, both of whom appear also in appropriate disguises. The closing moments of the drama, where these principals confront each other, corroborate and emphasize Hasenclever's position as I have tried to state it. The plot of the play has an unequivocal meaning: human beings who cannot cope with life twice receive new opportuni- ties and seemingly ideal conditions for successful lives-but all in vain. And now, as God visits these luckless individuals, he is ready to offer still further opportunities to Felix and Tonio: he wants to promote Felix and to send Tonio to an engineering school. But even this last- ditch attempt to redress the unavoidable ends in failure. Both Felix and Tonio decline the offer on the grounds that they are too ac- customed to their stations in life to make such a change. A humorous note comes to the fore at this point. Felix and Tonio want to leave for work, but God, in his role of the Kommnerzienrat, demands that both stay to finish the discussion: Der liebe Gott: Ich befehle euch hierzubleiben. Felix: Das geht nicht, Herr Kommerzienrat. Das diirfen wir nicht. Wir werden kontrolliert. Der liebe Gott: Ich gebe euch Urlaub. Felix: Das konnen Herr Kommerzienrat nicht. Das kann nur die Betriebsleitung. Herr Kommerzienrat kann da gar nichts machen. Der liebe Gott: Ich werde doch in meinem eigenen Werk noch etwas zu sagen haben! 65</page><page sequence="8">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Tonio: Nein, Herr Kommerzienrat. Der liebe Gott: Stimmt, mein Sohn. Ja, aber Leute, was soil nun werden? So geht es doch nicht weiter mit euch! Tonio: Da miussen wir schon selber Rat schaffen. Da kann uns keiner helfen. (Pp. 289-290) The humor of this exchange does not obscure the message. Just as the titular head of the mine does not have the power to order the lives of the lowest workers-that is completely in the hands of the "Betriebs- leitung," i.e., the "Establishment"-so, too, does God lack jurisdiction over the merest human being, for the latter is governed entirely by the unfathomable forces of fate. To return briefly now to Knevels' view of Hasenclever as a Feuerbachian atheist: since Hasenclever believed in an undefinable, unnameable yet omnipotent force, is it justified to call him an atheist? Only, I suggest, if atheism be defined as the denial of a personal God in the tradition of Judaism or Christianity. So, too, is the Feuerbach label only partially accurate. Like Feuerbach, Hasenclever interprets the Christian conception of God in anthropological, psychological terms. But the former also denied the existence of any metaphysical powers beyond man's reason, and this cannot be claimed of Hasenclever, who throughout his life subscribed with varying degrees of conviction to the notion that supernatural, extrarational forces controlled human life. In Ehen this notion is manifest in the predestined fate of its characters and the powerlessness of God, in a word, in the Betriebs- leitung. When the puzzled Magdalen finally asks, "Wer ist denn nun die Betriebsleitung?" God's amusing answer is once again significant: Der liebe Gott: (geht zur Rampe und sieht ins Publikum. Er will etwas sagen aber er stockt. Ware er ein Schauspieler, wiirde er sagen: "Das weiB der Teufel!" Er zuckt die Achseln, dreht sich um und geht mit Petrus und Magdalen ab.) (P. 290) The irreverence of these stage directions typifies the tone that Hasenclever adopts in portraying the heavenly residents. Here, then, is the other major element of Ehen: the iconoclastic and satiric treat- ment of traditionally religious symbols. As stated earlier, it is this second element which so aroused Church officials, and small wonder. God and two of the holiest saints in the Christian tradition, Mary Magdalen and St. Peter, are treated with disrespectful familiarity and yet, as the end of the play shows, with engaging humor. The setting for the scenes in heaven, the dress of these divine personages, the manner in which they converse, the racy familiarity 66</page><page sequence="9">HASENCLEVER'S TREATMENT OF RELIGION of the language-all these contribute to the satiric tone of the comedy. The first scene, which takes place in the private chambers of Mag- dalen, shows the drawing room of an elegant lady. Magdalen is a very fashionable aristocrat, clothes-conscious, a self-styled expert in matters of love. All around are strewn boxes of new dresses and hats; Magdalen has just returned from a shopping spree and is now trying on her purchases with the help of her maid. The music in the background is, appropriately, organ music-but, quite inappropriately, jazz. Hasenclever's trenchant iconoclasm emerges most conspicuously in the crass behavior of the saints. Magdalen, for example, haggles with a jeweler over the price of a fancy halo which she has just bought. Her part of the telephone conversation runs as follows: "Hier ist die heilige Magdalena. Horen Sie, Herr Meyer, der Heiligenschein gefillt mir. Ich finde die Idee sehr originell. Aber der Preis! Unmoglich. Woher soll ich das Geld nehmen? Sie vergessen, ich bin eine anstiindige Frau. Ja, das war friiher" (p. 260). As for St. Peter, he is "ein behibiger alter Herr in schwarzem Rock mit weif3em Bart, goldener Brille und einer groBen Aktentasche" (p. 260). His appearance and his worry about the financial crisis in heaven cast him somewhat in the role of a senior accountant. At one point he chides Magdalen for her extravagant spending of heavenly funds, but she defends herself indignantly: Magdalena: Sieh mal, Peterchen, ich muB doch anstandig aussehen. Bei uns soll alles vollkommen sein. Ich kann ein Kleid nicht zwei Jahre tragen. Hast du eine Ahnung, was Hiite kosten? Frag mal die heilige Therese. Ich muB standesgemiiB auftreten. Sankt Peter (offnet seine Aktentasche): Wir haben neulich zwei Schneiderrechnungen fur dich bezahlt. Dein Parfumgebrauch ist gewaltig. Du brauchst jede Woche eine neue Waschegarnitur. Du ruinierst uns. Magdalena: Dann miift ihr keine Frauen zu Heiligen machen. (P. 261) God's appearance on the stage heightens the satiric effect. Indeed, those who took offense at Ehen were understandably more provoked by the portrayal of God than by any other feature of the play. The stage directions call for him to be dressed like an old English lord: in sports clothes, smoking a pipe, clean-shaven, and with a monocle. A young boy with wings on his back, carrying a bag of golf clubs, follows him around. If St. Peter is the senior accountant of heaven, then God is the chairman of the board, a dignified business executive, who spends his leisure on the golf links, where he can escape the pressing problems 67</page><page sequence="10">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY of his business. Hasenclever's heaven is a giant business enterprise with God and his saints as board of directors. The discussion between God, Magdalen, and St. Peter in the first act is analogous to a business meeting of such a board. St. Peter gives a report on the current state of affairs, discussion follows, and only the final vote-taking is missing. But Hasenclever does not limit his antipathy to institutionalized religion to mere satiric characterizations of heavenly figures. The anti- pathy appears bluntly in the dialogue itself, as in God's comment quoted earlier, where God attributes his own existence to the figments of human imagination, or in the discussion of Act I concerning the official procedure for returning the three suicides to earth. Magdalen suggests falsifying such necessary papers as birth certificates, marriage license, and the like. Horrified, St. Peter objects: "Das ist strafbar," at which Magdalen answers in her most patronizing voice: "Petrus, sei kein Pedant. Wenn alle Urkunden echt waren, saf3en wir nicht hier" (p. 267). Because dogma was anathema to Hasenclever ("Ich habe von jeher gegen das Zwangsliiufige protestiert" [IuL, p. 37]), it comes as no surprise to find that the formal requirements of orthodox Judaism alienated Hasenclever also, so that on occasion he is equally iconoclastic towards Judaism. Examples of the latter attitude are to be found in his last, unpublished drama, "Konflikt in Assyrien," a satire against Nazism based on the biblical story of Queen Esther. Hasenclever depicts the heroic Mardochai of the original story as a rigid, pedantic Jew, blind in his obedience to religious duty, and intolerant of any deviation from the rabbinically imposed norms. Implicit in this characterization of Mardochai is the same critical view of religion which informs Ehen: Man ascribes to God his own ideas, and then dogmatically proclaims them as divinely prescribed. In the recently published autobiographic novel Die Rechtlosen, an account of his experiences in a French intern- ment camp, Hasenclever goes so far as to compare the severe separatist laws of orthodox Judaism with the racial decrees of the Nazis. In conversation with a Jew who is a fellow-inmate, he says: "Aber fallen Sie nicht, indem Sie Ihr RassebewulBtsein betonen, in den gleichen Fehler wie die Nazis? Ihr Familienkult erinnert mich an die alttesta- mentarischen Gesetze, die den Juden die Mischehen verboten. Unsere modernen Fanatiker haben viel von den Hohepriester gelernt" (p. 481). Hasenclever spoke these words when World War II was already in full swing. The circumstances of time and place rendered such views of Judaism rather unpopular, but Hasenclever maintained a 68</page><page sequence="11">HASENCLEVER'S TREATMENT OF RELIGION consistent attitude toward institutionalized religions. He was ever opposed to any formal system that wanted to impose its beliefs and its values upon others, and from this conviction he never deviated. Not only was formal religion too dogmatic in Hasenclever's eyes, but he found it equally lacking in commitment to moral principle. Nowhere is this view more passionately stated than in his article "Evangelische Stinkbomben," which was written to protest the repre- hensible behavior of divinity students at performances of Ehen. They had attended one or several performances of the play in Frankfurt armed with "Stinkbomben und Trinengas," as Hasenclever reports, and had hurled these missiles at the actors while the play was in progress. Hasenclever was incensed at their actions, and his article scathingly attacks these supposed disciples of Christ for their un- christian behavior. He would surely not have objected to conscientious criticism, no matter how strong, but he could not let pass unchallenged the unconscionable acts of students of religion who, in contrast to their preaching, vented their spleen on innocent actors. Hasenclever prefaces his remarks with a censure of the Frank- furter Zeitung, which had accused him of immorality in Ehen. In answering this charge and that of the newspaper's drama critic Bern- hard Diebold (described by Hasenclever as "Pfaffe Bernhard Diebold, der in seinen MuBestunden Literaturexegese treibt"), Hasenclever points to the newspaper's record of reactionary attitudes. This news- paper, which years earlier had demanded a ban on Hasenclever's Der Sohn, had already provoked a stinging rebuke from Ernst Toller for its parochial views. Hasenclever then attacks the Church and states succinctly his credo in the matter of God and ethics. First, he criti- cizes the imposition of values by one group upon others, particularly by those whose own creed abhors the use of force. Secondly, he acknowledges God as the Creator, but not as an anthropomorphic partisan leader-particularly not one who leads troops into battle. Finally Hasenclever implies that man's paramount duty is to maintain a high moral and ethical standard in his dealings with his fellowman, and that the clergy's foremost task should be to educate man in that ideal. The aggressive tone of his article may be observed in the conclusion: Die evangelischen Fanatiker, deren Sorge es sein sollte, das Elend ihrer Mitmenschen zu lindern, anstatt Stinkbomben auf unschuldige Schauspieler zu werfen und harmlose Zuschauer in ihrer Gesundheit zu schiidigen, haben durch ihr energisches 69</page><page sequence="12">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Vorgehen zweierlei erreicht. Sie haben durch geschickte Rek- lame weiteste Kreise fur mein Stuck interessiert und zugleich unschatzbare Propaganda gegen den Paragraphen der Gottes- lasterung geliefert. Sie waren sozusagen, Teil von jener Kraft, die nur das Bose will und stets das Gute schafft. Sie haben mir die Ehre erwiesen, ins Theater zu gehen. Wenn beim nichsten Kriegsausbruch ein Bittgottesdienst fur die zur Schlachtbank gefiihrten Truppen gefeiert wird, will ich der erste sein, der mit Tranengas und Stinkbomben dieser Vor- stellung beiwohnt, um die erhebende Kraft des Gotteswortes zu bestitigen: Du sollst nicht titen.11 When religion either directly causes physical aggression or even tolerates it with passive indifference, then that religion and its repre- sentatives are guilty of the worst sort of inhumanity. This charge recurs often in Hasenclever's writings; it can be found in his early Expressionist works, it appears in his satires and articles, and it is stated yet again in his autobiographic novels. Hasenclever measured religion and those who professed it by a single criterion: devotion to a high standard of ethical conduct.
