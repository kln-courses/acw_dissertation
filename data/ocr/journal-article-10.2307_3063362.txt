<plain_text><page sequence="1">The De otio poses problems, and D. does not shrink from controversy. Two of his views deserve special mention. First, he maintains that the ending of the De otio, as we have it, is complete. He successfully shows that the most commonly used arguments do not suffice to prove otherwise, and he urges that the train of thought at the end of the dialogue as it survives today is coherent and satisfying. But D. dodges vital stylistic considerations: the final sentence of ch. 8 tails off lamely in an unemphatic concessive clause - one misses the characteristic Senecan epigram or rhetorical flourish; also the rhythm is against completeness, being not just a double trochee (which D. notes as rare in his commentary) but a triple trochee, paralleled at the conclusion of a work only at Ep. 31, where an epigram justifies it. (One may also note that the Letters display greater rhythmical freedom at their conclusions than do the longer works.) However, more is at issue, besides the incompleteness of De otio's ending. Does ch. 8, which argues that otium is necessary for everybody, give Seneca's own view, as D. believes, or did he go on to reject that view in the lost part of the dialogue, as Miriam Griffin has argued? It depends how much self-consistency we expect from Seneca, and I think D. shows how Seneca could have endorsed the views of ch. 8. Secondly, D. is keen on spotting personal allusions in De otio, and he is confident about its date, A.D. 62, just before or just after Seneca's retirement from court. But not everybody will accept, e.g., that 1.4 quid agis, Seneca? deseris partes? must refer to Seneca's own withdrawal from politics (or, indeed, to withdrawal from politics at all), or that 2.2 must express his feelings about his own old age. Even if one did agree, one could blame D. for being misleadingly selective with his evidence: take the preface of nat. 3, certainly written not long after Seneca's retirement, where he expresses despair over his wasted life (cf. s. 2 annos inter uana studia consumptos... damna aetatis male exemptae) - how does that square with the more positive evaluation of his own career that D. detects in De otio 2.2? The ultra-autobiographical approach must account for everything. On a couple of matters D. has changed his mind between writing the commentary and the introduction. Whereas the commentary takes it for granted that Serenus is the addressee, the introduction reasonably takes a more sceptical line. The introduction is clear that MS C is just a meretricious descendant of A, but the apparatus cites C too often for comfort, and the commentary occasionally treats C and PQ as independent (pp. 183, 257, 258). The text is conservative (retaining 1.4 eniti manu, 3.1 quam si quis, etc.). D. prints two conjectures of his own: 1.4 bene ac nauiter, for benegnauiter (bene et nauiter Muretus; but what does bene... transfugis mean? In D.'s parallels bene goes naturally with the verb); 2.2 ad alios actus animi (not much better than other attempts on this crux). A few small points: at 4.2 Theiler is surely right that mari ac terris inserta means everything in earth and sea, for the context requires a comprehensive expression, not a reference just to islands and lakes; at 4.2 again, even if sedes deorum is an Epicurean preoccupation, the rest of the sentence justifies sedes here, whereas the position and the anthropomorphism of sedens are awkward; at 5.2, when discussing cupido noscendi in the Lyceum, D. might have mentioned the start of the Metaphysics. When the above holes have been picked, this remains a substantial, scholarly, illuminating commentary. University of Edinburgh HARRY M. HINE G. W. CLARKE: The Letters of Saint Cyprian: Translated and Annotated. (Ancient Christian Writers, 43.) Pp. 379. New York, N.Y., Ramsey N.J.: Newman Press, 1984. ?18. Cyprian's letters are of interest to any student of Christian antiquity because they give a picture of the day-to-day administration of an important African see during the mid-third century, because Cyprian is a man of great interest in himself and particularly for Anglicans, for when the Anglican bishop in the nineteenth century found himself for the first time in situations where there was no Government to appeal to and no precedents to go by, it was to Cyprian's example that he usually turned. In spite of Cyprian's theological shortcomings, his limitless use of the Jewish Law to regulate Christian affairs, his assumption that God was subject to outbursts of bad temper, his deplorable eucharistic theology, his was no bad exemplar to follow. Dr G. W. Clarke, Professor of Classical Studies at the Australian National University, has given us a beautiful and wholly commendable translation of the first 27 of Cyprian's letters and intends to continue the work in several more volumes. The Introduction is useful and concise. The 394 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">hypothetical list of Cyprian's clergy and the Chronological Table are particularly helpful, though it is not likely that anyone who read the letters here without any knowledge at all of Cyprian's career could readily find his way through the twists and turns of the years from 250 to 259. The translation is careful and readable with very few blemishes. The notes, which quote the Latin very fully, are admirable, almost amounting to a commentary. C. is very well acquainted with literature on Cyprian up to 1976, the year at which for reasons not stated his erudition stops. Careful attempts are made to place each letter in its original order. The book is handsomely produced, and should for long remain a standard work on the subject. In dealing with martyrs of the Decian persecution, C. might have introduced (pp. 38-9) Alban and Aaron and Julius in Britain (for it is difficult to place them in Diocletian's persecution and J. Morris' attempt to make them victims of Severus is speculative). The scholar mentioned on p. 159 is Srawley, not Strawley. C.'s translation of the notorious communicet cum suis ('with his household') is almost too restricted; perhaps 'with his people' (an even vaguer category) would be better (p. 92, Ep. 15.4). The indeterminate quod of which the translator complains (p. 206 n. 2, Ep. 7.1) might be paralleled in Patrick's very elastic use of that word. There are Greek misprints on pp. 89, 209(bis), 212 and 215. R. P. C. HANSON H E R B E R T W. B E N A R I O: Tacitus, Annals 11 and 12. (The Classical World Special Series, 3.) Pp. vi + 242; six maps. Lanham: University Press of America, 1983. Paper, $11.50. This book comprises a brief introduction on various aspects of Tacitus' life and works, then text, commentary, three appendixes, bibliography and an index of proper names. A good school edition of Annals 11-12 was sorely needed. Professor Benario, whose earlier services to Tacitus are well known, has gone some way towards filling the gap. His introduction is adequate and he manages (pp. 8-13) to convey something of Tacitus' qualities as a writer. His commentary, the main part of the book, is on the whole judicious and reliable, but it is also rather dull and sometimes abbreviated to obscurity. Further, many matters which invite comment receive none. B. states (p. v) that he aims to make the volume 'as compact as possible and thereby reduce costs'. A desire to reduce costs is laudable, but the fact remains that the subtleties of Tacitus' thought and style cannot be explained telegrammatically. Here are some examples of unduly brief notes. 11.10.1 'foret. For esset, a common substitution'. Where is it common? Everywhere? 11.19.3 'there were sound military reasons for Claudius' decision'. B. does not disclose them to us. 11.20.2 'The generals... were often given the outward marks of a triumph'. Extremely obscure. B. should have explained exactly what the ornamenta triumphalia involved. And here are some examples of confused or inaccurate notes. 11.16.3 'The alliteration of the letter p underscores this conflict'. Fanciful, indeed almost meaningless. 11.23.4 'factitatum est. T. is very fond of the frequentative, which gives his style both an archaic and a poetic flavor'. The general proposition might be disputed. As to factito, most parts of the verb cannot appear in dactylic verse. 11.26.1 'Although T. nowhere else has this combination, siue... an, its very boldness is attractive'. That is not the way to handle a textual problem. Again, on this same passage, it is not true that 'in presentation of alternates, T. invariably prefers the second'. Some questionable assertions are also to be found in the introduction. For instance, B. states (p. 6) that Tacitus' name is absent from the Dialogus in manuscript. One can at least argue, on the testimony of Decembrio, that the name was in fact present in the Hersfeldensis. It is a pity that B. chose to adopt Koestermann's notorious text and apparatus of 1960, in which L is put on a par with M. An apparatus which is fundamentally flawed can only mislead the unwary. Again, while maps are usually of some value, four of the maps which B. provides can hardly be read with the aid of a magnifying glass. Altogether, this book has too many faults to win warm praise, but it will assist students and therefore merits a qualified welcome. THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 395 University of the Witwatersrand F. R. D.
