<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guided Reading Programme 1986-87 Gabriel Daly The book1 we shall be studying in this year's guided reading course is about God. I am writing this preliminary essay because so small a book on so large a subject does perhaps need some introduction in a course like ours. After all, the theologian can deal with no more basic, important, or daunting subject than that of God. (Even to speak of God as a 'subject' has the feel of a theological solecism.) Yet we really have no choice but to ask John Haught's question, 'What is God?'. What matters is that we should do so with appropriate diffidence and modesty. 'If you have understood, it is not God'. St Augustine's crisp remark provides a salutary point of departure for any study of God. It is a statement of 'negative theology', i.e., theology which deals with what we do not know about God. Negative theology is a state of mind, an awareness of limitation, a wariness of false clarity, whether or image or of concept. God is not to be approached by our minds as if he were one among a number of objects. God is all in all, or he is nothing. In a very real sense it is true to say that God cannot be studied. He can be addressed in prayer (which is the best way of learning negative theology); but he cannot be studied. Theology used to be thought of as the study of God. However, various kinds of intellectual adversity during the last two centuries have made most theologians much more modest in the understand ing of their craft. Today they are more likely to define it, with, for example, Bernard Lonergan, as a study of the significance and value of a religion in a culture. This post-classical understanding of theology recognizes that what can be studied is the human response to God, what men and women have said about him since our species began to think about God and its members began to com 1.

The first thinking about God was not by means of the higher abstractions like 'omnipotence', but by story. Early men and women achieved an idea of God by telling stories which involved an unseen being or beings. These stories helped them to make sense of their world, to structure their experiences in the world, and to give shape and purpose to their existence. With the passage of time there was a remarkable growth of human confidence in naming God, in addressing him (mainly by appeals for help), and finally in attempting to say something about him. Such growth in confidence has its dangers. It gives the illusion of control; and control is precisely what we do not have over God. We speak of 'grasping' a truth when we come to understand its meaning. Grasping suggests power. As soon as we come to understand a difficult argument, we acquire power over it, we cease to fear its mystery, we are 'in the know' about it. Such power is out of the question in respect of God. Whatever we may be said to know about God is given to us by God himself and it is limited by the scope of our abilities. One great philosopher, George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, described human philosophizing about God as God understanding himself through human thought. Most Christian theologians would not be very happy with this way of putting the matter; but Hegel's view can at least serve as a corrective to any tendency we may have to treat God as an object to be studied and discussed. The Christian theology of grace teaches that we can have no salvific knowledge of God without God's special disclosure of himself which we call revelation. Catholic theology has traditionally distinguished between 'natural theology' on the one hand, and theology stemm ing from revelation on the other. This is a valuable distinction, pro vided it is deployed properly and is not used to erect a barrier between them. They are in fact interwoven with each other. We are never in a position to say that grace plays no part in what a philosopher may say about God. Some of the early Fathers of the Church liked to refer to the Greek philosopher Plato as 'the Attic Moses'. They were recognizing the truth that God's grace is at work everywhere in the world and that no persons or no Churches have the right to claim that they alone are recipients of God's grace. In Christian theology the distinction between nature and grace is intended primarily to distinguish between the world as creation and the concrete history of God's dealing in a particular way with a par ticular people such as the Jews or the followers of Jesus Christ. Such a distinction is necessary; but, once again, we must note that it does not license us to claim any absolute exclusivity for Jews or Christians. Revelation is grace, that is, God's free disclosure and</page><page sequence="3">GUIDED READING PROGRAMME 655 gift of himself in particular historical circumstances. It is not a charter for denying that God is at work outside these particular cir cumstances. Theologians today are therefore more chary than many of their predecessors of creating a cognitive gap between revelation and 'natural' knowledge of God. Nature and culture are too closely related. Negative theology applies as much to revelation as it does to natural theology. When God discloses himself to men and women through a particular historical experience, it is always with the implicit understanding that we continue to 'see in a glass darkly' (1 Cor. 13:12). (Paul's glass did not give the clear image of our modern mirrors.) Augustine's warning is as applicable to the followers of Jesus as to any philosopher. To know God is to know him on his terms not on ours; and God's terms take into considera tion our native limitations. With these thoughts in mind let us return to the means by which God allows us to think and speak about him. These are (1) image and (2) concept. (1) The images we form of God can range from the utterly crude image proper to the small child to something more impressionistic and sophisticated, which is in effect a composite picture formed from qualities we derive from ordinary human experience. In spite of its more shadowy form and apparent sophistication we should be wise not to regard it as much of an improvement on the cruder image. One important thing about our image of God is that it may - almost inevitably will - suggest that God is 'located' in a place called heaven, which in turn will almost inevitably be pictured as somewhere 'above'. A moment's reflection will suffice to show the impossibility of this, but images take shape unbidden. We may pride ourselves on the sophistication of our idea of God while being actually its prisoner. An image is necessarily concrete, individual, particular. That is both its virtue and its danger. It localizes; and a local deity is an idol. Many religions and Churches ban physical representations like pictures and statues, on the grounds that they will be worshipped in place of God and thus serve as an occasion for idolatry. Such prohibitions are powerless to remove the interior images provided by the imagination. ?Since interior images will be formed whether we like it or not, it is wiser to accept their inevitability and to keep a critical eye on them, ready if necessary to break and reform them. They will always contain an element of distortion which can be spiritually damaging or impoverishing. The images we form of God will be made out of human experiences, good, bad, and indifferent. They are cultural in origin (if you are a Jungian, you may wish to</page><page sequence="4">656 THE FURROW hold that they may be influenced by archetypes from the collective unconscious), and their emotional content (e.g. fear, awe) is more significant than whatever cognitive character they may have. (2) Concepts differ from images in being abstract and universal, whereas images are concrete and particular. Concepts therefore give the illusion of greater sophistication. Their abstractness and universality are relatively free of emotion (except in cases where certain words have come to be associated in individual minds with certain emotions). Whereas images of God may tempt to idolatry, concepts of God may promote arid detachment and the illusion of grasping the mystery, thereby profaning it. Concepts such as omnipotence and omniscience are valuable as long as we remember that they do not provide 'information' about God; they merely recognize that the lines we draw on the basis of human experience extend infinitely far beyond the grasp of human calculation. Con cepts have the added disadvantage of ignoring the importance of commitment in any salvific knowledge of God, unless they are formed at the bidding of the heart. One does not love an uncaused cause, one merely registers it. This is why Blaise Pascal distinguished between the God of the philosophers and the God of Abraham and Jesus Christ. God is never to be identified with the images or concepts we form of him. This is a deceptively simple but spiritually crucial observation. It helps us to differentiate between prayer and theology, which are, or should be, closely associated but which are none the less distinct. We pray to God as he really is, that is, to the God who is beyond the power of image and concept to depict him; but we pray through the image and the concept, which are always present. As long as we remember that an image and a concept are only a means for reaching the reality, we can enjoy and profit from, say, the images of God in the Bible. We can freely recognize their relative character, their imperfections, and sometimes even their humour. They are human constructions and are therefore per fectible, corrigible, and even disposable. Not until the image of God is a man named Jesus are we freed from the danger of anthropomorphism; and even here our talent for distortion is so great that we have allowed cheap and gaudy representations of Jesus to tarnish the image of God's Word made flesh. Two concepts have signal importance in talk about God. They are 'transcendence' and 'immanence'. Though they are abstract concepts, they inevitably suggest spatial images and provide a useful instance of how images come unbidden into the mind. Both words are attempts to say something of immense importance about God's relationship to his creation. They are dialectically related,</page><page sequence="5">GUIDED READING PROGRAMME 657 that is, they are opposite to, but not exclusive of, each other. In a healthy theology they act as correctives to each other. 'Transcen dent' literally means 'going beyond', and 'immanent' means 'dwelling in'. The transcendence of God is his distinctness from the world he has created. The immanence of God is his nearness, his presence, his indwelling in the world he has created. If God's transcendence is emphasized at the expense of his immanence, we get an image of him which suggests a remote spectator of his crea tion, in no way involved in what is going on within it. Eighteenth century deism was a form of natural religion which accepted the existence of God but refused to recognize his involvement in the world. The God of the deists is so transcendent that he leaves the world (including human beings) totally to its own devices. If God's immanence is emphasized at the expense of his transcendence, we get an image of him which suggests that he is identified with his creation. Pantheism (or monism) results from a religion of pure immanence. In it God is so identified with the world that he ceases to be distinguishable from it. Everything is God and God is everything. Transcendence and immanence are thus correlative to each other, and a sound theology must seek to preserve a balance between them. Fundamentalist forms of religion, whether Protes tant biblicism or Catholic authoritarianism, tend to exaggerate God's apartness from creation at the expense of his presence in nature, in human experience, in human history, and in human response to nature and art. The hunger for miracles and other manifestations of direct and observable divine intervention in human affairs is often an attempt to compensate for a form of religion which neglects the immanence of God and therefore has to look for external signs and assurances that God cares for us. A God who is thought of as distant from his creation will need all sorts of intermediaries, authorities, and external signs in order to make his presence felt and his will known. An exaggeration of divine transcendence at the expense of divine immanence robs religion of its mystery, its warmth, its affectivity, and its harmony with every day life. It divorces faith from daily experience, Church from world, religion from those forces in the world that make for true civilization, holiness from artistic vision, redemption from crea tion, grace from nature. In short, a neglect of divine immanence promotes a preoccupation with externals at the expense of inner experience and spiritual interiority. The book we shall be studying in the coming year should be seen as an attempt to help us to approach God through our depth experiences. This means that the author is inviting his readers to</page><page sequence="6">658 THE FURROW give more attention than they are perhaps used to doing, to the immanent dimension of God's presence and activity. If, however, one has grown used to an image or concept of God which is seriously lacking in the characteristics associated with God's immanence within us, Haught's approach could be initially disorientating. We may simply not be accustomed to looking for God's presence deep within our own experience. Much pre-Vatican II Catholic devotional life was alarmingly non-mystical. It favoured apparitions, miraculous interventions, and a general spiritual dependence on externals. The holy came to be associated with the extraordinary and the extravagant. It may well be that people prefer the image of a distant God who draws near only occa sionally and only through extraordinary (even sensational) interventions. On the other hand, young people educated in the era of post conciliar catechesis may have constructed for themselves an image nearer to that of a benign - one almost said cuddly - figure who makes no demands at all on them. This image would also need cor rection. It is not easy to combine the notions of judgement and pro vident care when we are thinking about God. Sentimentality is not a satisfactory substitute for puritanical severity. There is, however, an older and deeper tradition in the Church which, for a variety of reasons, largely disappeared from Church life at the end of the 17th century. Its restoration will depend greatly upon our ability to recover a sense of God's immanence. There are many signs that the process of recovery is in fact taking place in Catholic spirituality at the moment. A book such as Haught's can help to give the enterprise theological underpinning. In effect what Haught is saying is that if we wish to find God at work in his creation, we must look deep within ourselves into those experiences which exist in every human life but which are not always sufficiently attended to as manifestations of God's presence. I began by mentioning St Augustine's remark about our inability to understand God. This is an indispensable warning at the beginn ing of any search for God. It must, however, be complemented by quiet contemplation of God's ravishing nearness. There is paradox here. What else could we expect? The God we can never understand is nevertheless so close to us that we can fail to discern his presence because we are looking too far into the distance. This year is the 16th centenary of the conversion of St Augustine, who has left us in his Confessions a haunting account of his search for God. He had sought God in a variety of different philosophies, until he found his gaze directed inwards to the depths of his own experience. Two passages from his writings may serve as a fitting</page><page sequence="7">GUIDED READING PROGRAMME 659 introduction to our year's study. The first is from his Confessions and has a famous opening. Late have I loved you, O beauty so old and so new; late have I loved you. You were within me, and I was on the outside. I sought you outside myself, and, unlovely as I was, I fell upon the lovely things that you have made. You were with me, but I was not with you. I was kept from you by those very things which, if they did not have their being in you, would have no being at all. You have called and cried and have broken past my deafness. You have shone and scintillated and put my blindness to flight. You have breathed your fragrance about me, I drew my breath, and I have gasped for you. I have tasted, and now I hunger and thirst for you. You have touched me, and I have burned for your peace (Conf X, 27). The other passage comes from Augustine's commentary on St John's gospel. Recognize something within yourself, and I really mean within yourself. . . . Descend into yourself, be present to your most private self, your mind, and see there, if you can, what I am trying to say. For if you are far from yourself, how can you draw near to God? {In Joh. Ev. XXII, 10) Disturbing The Peace, pp. 1-22 Vincent Mac ?amara It has become quite a clich? to say that Christianity has never been tried. The expression is generally taken to mean that we have never seriously lived out the implications of our call. But it may be that the problem is deeper - that we do not know what it means to be a Christian. Our Christianity has become such a collection of all sorts - bits of morality (respect for life, divorce, contraception), bits of Canon Law (Sunday Mass, marrying in Church, priestly celibacy), bits and pieces of truths thrown together (the grace of the sacraments, heaven, infallibility, the Immaculate Conception), historical accretions (parishes, synods, the rosary, cardinals, confirmation classes, male priesthood, parish councils). And Vincent Mac ?amara is a priest of St Patrick's Missionary Society, Kiltegan. He is a Lecturer in Theology at St Patrick's, Kiltegan and at Trinity College, Dublin.</page><page sequence="8">660 THE FURROW arguments about every bit of it! You could lose your way. Disturbing The Peace1 cuts its way through the tangle and invites us into the clearing where we might meet the central issues: who is Jesus Christ; what does it mean to believe in him; what does it mean to be a Christian? It takes nerve to ask yourself the question - you wouldn't know where it would lead you. We all have our own image of Jesus Christ 'derived from many sources: family, Church, school. . . (p. 5). Perhaps Bredin is right in wondering whether the image does not now 'bear far more resemblance to us than to Christ' and in asking whether Jesus Christ would 'recognize him self in the image we have of him' (p. 6). That is strong talk and that is the challenge of the book. If last year you read Rahner's The Practice of Faith you will remember that he asked us to distinguish the core of Christian faith from the periphera. Bredin is on the same thing. He would like us to strip off all that through the cen turies has fudged and distorted the clean lines of the image of Jesus Christ and start again - if that were possible. It isn't, of course. One can, however, try to recapture and confront oneself with the original experience of the disciples. It is important to impress upon ourselves (it seems obvious, of course, but we need to jolt ourselves) that Jesus left us no writings or personal memoirs. Access to him is through the disciples. We meet him only through the eyes, the experience, the faith (as well as the biases, the culture, the mind-set) of others. Bredin invites us to meet him afresh by getting in touch with the impression he made on them, the stories they told about him, how the stories touched those who heard them and how finally the record of this found its way into writing. Back there before time's lichens crept over the hard rough grain of the story. What we are to discover is how the New Testament com munities came to say that 'Jesus is Lord' and what that meant for them. We cannot be satisfied today with being able to rattle off catechism formulae about Jesus or bits of theology - grace, salva tion, redemption, incarnation, risen, right hand of the Father. There is a real danger that we would mistake assent to Catholic beliefs and attendance at its rituals for discipleship. For one thing our formulas of faith (Council decrees, creeds, Papal statements) can never catch the richness of who he is. For another, one could be a fierce defender of the Church, a vicious watchdog of orthodoxy but no disciple. One could be a churchman or woman but not a Christian. If we are to have this encounter in the clearing our return to the Bible must be fairly sophisticated. I find much to ponder in pp. 1. Disturbing The Peace by Eamonn Bredin. Columba Press. Price ?8.95.</page><page sequence="9">GUIDED READING PROGRAMME 661 15-17 - a whole course in modern scripture studies. Don't pass over them lightly. Note the significance of communities. Note the emphasis on the period between the death of Jesus and the writing of the New Testament, the period when the first disciple told their stories of the Lord. Note that Bredin pointedly calls the New Testa ment authors editors. Note that what we have is the memory of Jesus through a post-resurrection dawning of awareness - faith (their faith) calling to our faith. (The memory plays tricks but it also puts things in perspective and enables one to see wholes.) Note what he has to say about the struggle to fit Jesus into pre-existing categories and presuppositions and his talk of a multiplicity of approaches (p. 13). It is through all of this - and only through all of it - that we can come into contact with Jesus Christ. There is no use in a hand-me-down Jesus, a faded copy that we have bought from some earnest trafficker in religious goods. We must contact him in the authentic sources. The challenge is to retrace the journey undertaken by his disciples (p. 19) so that we may inwardly know the meaning of the statements that we have about him in our tradition, 'in gospel and creed and council' (p. 19). We have to struggle in that place of light and shade where one moves 'from knowing him as man to confessing him as son of God' (p. 21). That is personal conversion. It is the 'supreme advantage' compared with which everything else is 'so much rubbish' (p. 3). It is a private affair, a critical challenge. Much of what Jesus said and did was strange. Given their values, attitudes and culture how could the disciples have followed a man who said and did what he said and did? (p. 22). What is the mystery hidden at the heart of their faith? 1. Does the sketch of classical Christology ring any bells for you? (p. 8). Did you experience the difficulties mentioned in pp. 9-10? Do you have the same problem identifying with our Lady? 2. Do you think that Christianity today is rather tired compared with the dewy freshness of gospel spirituality? Why is this so? 3. What elements in your Church most distort the image of Jesus Christ?
