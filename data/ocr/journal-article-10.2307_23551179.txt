<plain_text><page sequence="1">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION Robert N. McCauley The aims of this paper are to identify three barriers to the develop ment of cognitive approaches to the study of religion and to suggest how each might be circumvented. The first of these barriers is meth odological and lurks amid two issues that, historically, have domi nated anthropologists' reflections on the relationship of their disci pline to psychology. The older of the two can be characterized as the "psychic unity" controversy (see Shore 1995). The second issue is the controversy over the "autonomy of culture". Advocates of the latter thesis are usually unsympathetic to psychological explanations of re ligious phenomena. In the first section, I shall begin by briefly exam ining each of those issues and then exploring the connections be tween the two as well as interesting logical tensions that arise in the face of popular responses to each. In section two, I shall consider a pair of barriers to a cognitive psychology of religion rooted in two strategies that have dominated many psychologists' approaches to the study of religion. I will argue that for some purposes, at least, both strategies should be relaxed. Finally, in section three, I shall briefly sketch one sort of cognitive approach to religious phenomena, sug gesting how it handles the two strategic barriers in particular. 1. Cognitive unity or cultural autonomy? The psychic unity controversy revolves around the question of whether all members of our species have roughly the same psycho logical make-up (and cognitive equipment) or not. From its inception anthropology has faced the problem of explaining the substantial divergences of cultures with respect to their scientific, technological, and institutional achievements. No doubt, differences in natural envi ronments play some role. Still, accounting for such disparities, at least in part, on the basis of different cognitive profiles has always been a standard explanatory strategy. Not unlike missionaries' periodic visits to their home churches, much of anthropology's charm has turned on providing academic © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2000 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 12, 141-161</page><page sequence="2">142 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY colleagues with reports about the odd ways other folks seem to think. The huge number of such reports provides an evidential force that largely eliminates the suspicions that scattered anecdotes would en gender. Moreover, on some relevant fronts cross-cultural psychologi cal experiments offer evidence supporting anthropologists' claims about the diversity of cognitive styles and strategies used in different cultures (Cole and Scribner 1974 and Scribner and Cole 1981). The critical question concerns the salient variable(s) responsible for these different patterns of thought. The controversy surrounding the apparent cognitive ¿¿runity anthropologists have documented con cerns just how deeply it goes. Are anthropologists reporting on the impact of cultural variation on cognitive style or on differences whose origins reside in the biology of different human groups? Do different peoples think differently because their varying cultures shape them so or because they differ biologically? Finally, are differences in cogni tive strategies rooted in cultural or biological variation? Each of the two principal responses has its drawbacks. The logic of biological explanations seems clear enough initially, though usually the intention is to explain putative differences in native cognitive abilities rather than cognitive strategies. The intellectual efforts devoted to establishing the cognitive superiority or inferiority of one racially or ethnically defined group or another has had a long and undistin guished history (Gould 1981). The point is not just a political one. The difficulties associated with clarifying the central concepts, em ploying and interpreting statistical measures properly, ascertaining the import of the myriad empirical findings the various parties to such discussions deem relevant, and fathoming the sheer complexity of the psychological and biological research should suffice both to belie the apparent simplicity of such biological explanations and to give partisans considerable pause about any of their conclusions (Neisser et al. 1996). In the nineteenth century most of the founders of anthropology subscribed to the biological unity of humankind, accounting for the differences between cultures in terms of cultural evolution. Basically, on this view Western cultures had reached more progressive stages in the process of cultural evolution than had those outside the West. Although significant biological differences might not be responsible for Western development, Western culture was presumed not only to be more developed but also to possess a superior arsenal of intellec tual tools by virtue of which it was more developed.</page><page sequence="3">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 143 For a host of reasons, not the least of which was an emerging appreciation in the course of fieldwork of the intellectual sophistica tion of non-Western peoples, anthropologists in this century have largely abandoned arguments for the psychic unity of humankind that rely on appeals to stages of cultural evolution to explain cogni tive diversity. Nonetheless, most cultural anthropologists in this cen tury have resisted biological accounts of cognitive variation. To do so is neither to affirm a contradiction nor to deny the cognitive diversity to which anthropologists have continued to give testimony but, rather, to adopt either or both of two positions. Boas (1963) was an early advocate of the first; in fact, he endorsed both. Focusing on the configurations of material and historical ar rangements unique to each culture, Boas and many cultural anthro pologists since affirm some form of cultural relativism, holding that cultures are not more or less advanced; they are just different. The fitness of a culture is no more absolute than the fitness of an organ ism. Judgments about the adequacy of some cultural form are always relative to the context. Each culture is a product of the particular constellation of conditions and historical circumstances in which it has developed. The differences between cultures and their associated cognitive styles pose no threat to claims for an underlying psychic and cognitive unity, because the various patterns that arise are adap tations to specific natural and cultural environments. The second position, of which even Levy-Bruhl qualifies as an advocate, affirms the reality of cognitive diversity, but insists that it is, indeed, overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, a product of culture. Dif ferent social and cultural circumstances produce different cognitive outcomes. Human groups of comparable sizes exhibit comparable biological variation. To avoid the appearance of begging the question in the face of the biological option, i.e., the claim that the correct explanation of divergent cognitive styles across cultures is rooted in biological variation, advocates of this second position, presumably, must maintain that any biologically unimpaired human could ac quire other cultures' patterns of thought given the right circum stances. To some extent, anthropologists' very ability to report on other cultures' cognitive styles presumes precisely that. With all the appro priate ceteris paribus clauses in place, the claim is that any normal human being could have learned any culture's patterns of thought, if he or she had been suitably enculturated. Important evidence for the</page><page sequence="4">1 44 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY truth of this counter-factual is that many people do seem to learn other cultures' ways of thinking, even when all things are not equal (see, for example, Barth 1987: 75, 88). In explaining cognitive diversity the number of complications ac companying the biological option may only be exceeded by the number accompanying this cultural one. The central concepts are largely the same, and it is no easier to draw hard distinctions differ entiating particular cultures within the morass of cultural variation than it is to draw them about races or ethnic groups amidst the perplexities biological variation presents. Of course, issues concerning the application and interpretation of statistical measures and the range of empirical findings the various parties deem relevant also remain unchanged. So, if cultural accounts enjoy an advantage, it would, presumably, inhere in their theoretical underpinnings, their investigative methods, or their research designs. Unfortunately, these seem just the fronts where socio-cultural investigations typically ex hibit relatively less precision, penetration, and verisimilitude than the natural sciences. Nowhere in science is the gap greater between the problems that animate inquiries and the models and methods that address them than in the study of social and cultural systems. That gap has only encouraged hermeneutically inclined anthro pologists and their post-modern brethren (advocates of what I shall hereafter call "pan-hermeneutics"). Having foresworn anthropology's long-standing aspirations to scientific respectability in the study of culture, these anthropologists find solace in this gap. They eschew searches for explanatory mechanisms, championing, instead, the fol lowing two positions: [1] some variation on the old autonomy of culture thesis, i.e., the claim that fundamentally cultural concepts ('power' is the current favorite) are necessary and sufficient for the analysis of cultural phenomena and [2] some version of cultural constructivism, i.e., the claim that cultural forces construct not just meanings but realities out of the material and psychic substratum (see, for example, White 1992). This newest line of defense for the autonomy of culture thesis diverges from its predecessors in that it buys the analytical authority of cultural concepts at the cost of surrendering cultural anthropolo gy's explanatory pretensions. The uniqueness of each cultural setting makes the interpretation of the meanings and realities cultures create analysis enough. A few comments are in order. First, I recognize that many post-modern cultural anthropologists</page><page sequence="5">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 145 may not grant (or even recognize) the coincidences of their positions with either the autonomy of culture movement or hermeneutic ap proaches. Nor are they likely to acknowledge the nearly direct de scent of post-modernism from the latter. Second, this discussion of the autonomy of culture thesis does not concern loyalty to a particular school of thought (emanating largely from the University of Chicago a few decades back) but rather a position to which, I would maintain, both interpretive and post-modern cultural anthropologists are com mitted (whether they realize it or not) no less than that earlier group was. Third, ironically, their roots in hermeneutic approaches notwith standing, many contemporary post-modern anthropologists' preoc cupations with power relations implicitly presuppose the possibility of explaining cultural phenomena. Usually, though, they seem neither to realize or acknowledge this implication nor particularly interested in either refining or testing the explanatory hypothesis they advance, viz., that all cultural arrangements, finally, can be explained exclu sively in terms of the distribution and exercise of power (culturally conceived) (Nuckolls 1995.) Without either the means for or the ex pectation of refining and testing such hypotheses, a discipline con stantly risks devolving into ideology. The spirit that informs the wielding of such blunt instruments for the analysis of sociocultural phenomena seems contrary both to the anti-reductionistic commitments of these post-modern cultural an thropologists and to the entire discipline's preoccupations with detail and cultural uniqueness. Sweeping theories of this sort often gain adherents, but rarely, if ever, undergo much amendment in the face of contrary evidence. Still, the point of this discussion is not to challenge the prevailing ideology in cultural anthropology on every front, but rather to ex plore the logical tensions underlying simultaneous commitments (consciously recognized or not) to [a] the possibility of systematically explaining sociocultural phenomena, [b] the autonomy of culture thesis, and [c] the psychic unity thesis. Interestingly, I think that most post-modern accounts of culture in terms of power relations are im plicitly pledged to all three. (As I suggested above, they are not likely to confess to either thesis [a] or [b].) Even if I am wrong about that, though, my main objectives are to convince anthropologists and scholars of religion who are committed to all three [1] that recent psychological and cognitive science has produced methods and find</page><page sequence="6">146 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY ings that will illuminate sociocultural phenomena and, thus, [2] that they should surrender thesis [b]. Virtually all of contemporary cultural anthropologists do, indeed, subscribe to the psychic unity thesis as well. Thus, they affirm the centrality of human beings' common biological readiness to acquire whatever culture they find themselves in (at least before achieving some critical developmental thresholds). They also reject proposals that promote biological bases of cognitive and cultural differences. While generally supporting the values that inform these positions and happily acknowledging culture's role in shaping many meanings and realities, not only do I see no need to press any autonomy claims in behalf of either culture or cultural analyses, I regard them as counterproductive. However, it has not generally been the autonomy of culture thesis that has worried the scientifically oriented dissenters in recent anthropology. Over the decades anthropologists have of fered many arguments in its defense. The deeper and perfectly legiti mate concern of anthropologists who still seek general explanations has been with the relativism so many of their colleagues enthusiasti cally embrace. The relativism that results from the overwhelming emphasis on the contextual and the idiographic and that character izes the Boasian legacy, hermeneutics, and cultural constructivism in anthropology constitutes a substantial epistemic burden—a burden that anthropologists who retain serious comparative ambitions, let alone general explanatory ambitions, should find difficult to bear. Without at least some low level theorizing systematically connecting some cultural features with one another, both comparative and ex planatory projects risk being cast adrift in a sea of random details. Still, anthropologists unwilling to swallow either extreme versions of cultural relativism or their epistemic consequences have not felt chary about the autonomy of culture thesis. Three considerations, discussed in order of increasing importance, should make us wary, though. First, underlying the more recent pan-hermeneutic rendering of the cultural account of cognitive diversity is a strikingly traditional view about where most of the explanatory action resides—and, inter estingly, it is not at the cultural level. The cultural autonomy thesis maintains the necessity and sufficiency of cultural phenomena to account for (other) cultural phenomena. Explanations of cognitive diversity should appeal to cultural forces and forms. So far, so good. But, interestingly, on the psychic unity thesis cognitive diversity be</page><page sequence="7">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 147 comes a comparatively superficial fact, at least from an explanatory stand point. The underlying biological unity of the species and the capaci ties that biology endows do the primary explanatory work. Neonates are biologically prepared to acquire whatever culture they find them selves in. In its explanatory assumptions at least, the heart of the twentieth century version of the psychic unity thesis has a surprisingly biological beat. Culture's effects, by comparison, are, apparently, lit tle better than unsystematic. Cultural constructivism does not circumvent this problem. That position simply advances an even stronger version of the cultural autonomy thesis. Cultural constructivism insists not only that analy ses employing exclusively cultural terms can account for cultural phe nomena but also that many phenomena that are typically discussed at lower levels of analysis (e.g., the emotions) are, in fact, the results of cultural forces. However, such accounts are utterly implausible precisely when explananda concern phenomena which cultural vari ables do not constrain. That, of course, is expressly the assumption about the psychic unity thesis. Still, this first consideration has the feel of debates about half full and half empty glasses. The second concern is more serious. The comparative superficiality of the phenomena, ultimately, is not nearly as important as the comparative superficiality of proposed explana tions for it. Behind these concerns is a basic question regarding the logic of a cultural explanation. Recall that pursuing the cultural option with respect to cognitive profiles is to declare that the variation to be explained is cultural, not biological. The cultural autonomy thesis requires that explanations of this variation proceed on cultural terms. Absent detailed accounts of the cultural mechanisms involved, though, such explanations inevita bly look extremely thin. Citing variations in specific cultures provides little explanatory grip on the divergence of their associated cognitive profiles, if those sundry profiles are themselves construed merely as further examples of cultural variation. More generally, the thickness of cultural descriptions is typically inversely proportional to that of cul tural explanations. Such thoroughly cultural explanations are, all too often, insufficiently theoretical, i.e., their central concepts do not di verge much from those employed in the descriptions of the explananda. It was just this dearth of detailed theoretical accounts of cultural mechanisms that "identify causal links, and not mere correla tions or isomorphics" (Barth 1987: 55) as well as the gap between</page><page sequence="8">1 48 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY existing models and the phenomena they address that has so reas sured the pan-hermeneuticists about their adoption of the autonomy of culture thesis and about their disinterest in the standing of their proposals as scientific explanations. We have two objections born of this second consideration: [1] that proposed cultural explanations of irreducibly cultural phenomena that contain no theoretical proposals about the cultural mechanisms involved are ralikely to achieve much explanatory leverage and [2] that the cultural autonomy thesis encourages discounting just those investigations (in psychology and biology) most likely to stimulate fruitful anthropological theorizing about such mechanisms. More generally, not only does the cultural autonomy thesis restrict the form of acceptable explanations of cultural phenomena, it also discourages scholars from looking in just those quarters perhaps most likely to suggest useful explanatory theories. In short, the thesis imposes con straints on acceptable cultural explanations that greatly increase the probability that the proposals it permits will prove comparatively shallow. This leads directly to the third consideration. One common strat egy in science for explaining correlations discovered at one level of analysis, especially when no theoretically suggestive models have arisen at that level, is to inquire about the explanatory resources available at lower levels of analysis. This amounts to searching for an underlying mechanism producing the observed patterns (see Lawson and McCauley 1990: 177-180, and Bechtel and Richardson 1993). The problem for so many cultural anthropologists here, though, is that this would seem to be tantamount to abandoning the commit ment to cultural analysis in favor of either psychology or biology. Such "reductionistic" options are non-starters for pan-hermeneutic cultural anthropologists, in particular. Surely one of the most ironic consequences of pan-hermeneutic imperialism in the social and cultural sciences and of its strong dis tinction between the human and natural sciences especially is that, in the course of shielding some dimensions of human affairs from causal explanation, pan-hermeneuts have generally relinquished the natural sciences to traditional logical empiricism. Thus, they have largely presumed the soundness for the natural sciences of logical empiricist accounts of scientific explanation (in terms of deductions from causal laws) and of cross-scientific relations (in terms of intertheoretic "re duction"). Over the past two decades a huge literature has emerged</page><page sequence="9">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 149 that not only challenges the appropriateness of these models for the analysis of the natural sciences, but offers alternative accounts (e.g., Bechtel and Richardson 1993). The assumptions of antiquated conceptions of cross-scientific rela tions in terms of intertheoretic reduction, which envision the ability of lower level theories to displace higher level proposals and their ontologies, have haunted cultural anthropologists from afar. Much recent work in the philosophy of science would aid considerably in exorcising these demons. For example, recent philosophical models of cross-scientific rela tions emphasize the benefits that arise for both upper and lower level investigations from multilevel research in science (see especially Wimsatt 1976; Bechtel 1986; P.S. Churchland 1986; and McCauley 1986 and 1996). Scientists are not nearly as interested in theoretical and ontological economizing as philosophers have been. Science is too opportunitistic an undertaking. When scientists look—either up or down—to research at other levels, their aim is typically to gain theoretical inspiration, to borrow experimental techniques, or to ob tain additional evidence to help with unsolved problems at their own level of analysis. Contrary to classical reductionism, displacing work at other levels is usually the last thing on scientists' minds! Little, if any, evidence exists in twentieth-century science of such displace ments of theory or ontology arising as the result of investigations simultaneously carried on at multiple levels of analysis (McCauley 1996). The success of multilevel cooperation in twentieth century science (consider, for example, the course of research in genetics over the past fifty years) strongly suggests that anthropologists needlessly im poverish their investigations when, insisting on the autonomy of cul ture and of cultural explanations, they hope to insulate their theoreti cal proposals from psychological or biological research. Exploring the implications of psychological models for cultural phenomena will no more eliminate the need for cultural research and modeling than exploring the implications of the double helix for genetics eliminated research and modeling in that field. It will only result in more sophis ticated findings all around. (Consider too the cross-fertilization be tween neuroscientific and psychological accounts of memory and perception over the past two decades (see Gazzaniga 1988 and Neisser 1994, respectively). Students of culture should look for tactical, theoretical, explana</page><page sequence="10">1 50 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY tory, and evidentiary angles wherever they can be found. The goal of cross-scientific explorations is to enhance the methodological refine ment, the theoretical penetration, or the empirical accountability of one or more of the sciences involved. Nor must we presume that either the ampliative resources or the corrective influences must al ways originate at the lower level. Most interlevel forays of these sorts prove mutually enriching for the disciplines involved. Insisting upon investigative isolation rarely abets explanatory progress. Cultural anthropology pays too high a price for its putative autonomy. Autonomy claims make mischief mostly. They have obscurantist consequences, discouraging scholars from exploring re lated avenues of research at other levels of analysis. Any science allegedly autonomous of other sciences isn't—in one sense or the other. I hope to dissuade those cultural anthropologists who have not relinquished hope for scientific explanations of cultural phenomena not only from resting content with pan-hermeneutics but also from adopting the autonomy of culture thesis. Pan-hermeneutics, among other failings, congratulates anthropologists for subscribing to the autonomy of culture thesis, and that thesis needlessly restricts sources of theoretical inspiration, methodological insight, and evidential sup port. 2. The commonplace and the cognitive I have argued that cultural anthropologists cannot at the same time readily uphold the autonomy of culture, the psychic and cognitive unity of humankind, and the possibility of obtaining penetrating expla nations of cultural phenomena. Of these three theses I contend that they should abandon the first, since the consequences of adopting it diminishes the interest of the other two. If that line of argument has been successful, then I have removed one of the existing barriers to the proposal that cognitive findings and methods can illuminate the study of cultural systems and of religious systems in particular. The second barrier is of a more practical sort. It should not be removed so much as scaled. A brief historical over view will help to clarify matters here. For a large part of this century scientifically-minded anthropolo gists and scholars of religion could hardly be faulted for neglecting psychology, for most of psychology, arguably, had little to offer those concerned to develop scientific approaches to cultural materials.</page><page sequence="11">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 151 Clinically inspired works, especially Freud's, supplied and condnue to supply abundant conceptual and theoretical resources (patricide, death wishes, etc.) for explaining a huge range of religious phenom ena (see, for example, Nuckolls 1993). Still, scholars in religion and anthropology have typically appropriated those resources only within overtly hermeneutic projects (e.g., Obeysekere 1990) or within projects that suffer from many of the same problems that plague Freud's own proposals—at least when they are construed as theoreti cal explanations in science. Different critics raise different objections. The two most prominent complaints from the standpoint of those with scientific interests are either that the Freudian proposals are so underspecified and flexible that no empirical finding can defeat them or that where they are well-specified, the empirical findings defeat them overwhelmingly (see Grunbaum 1984; Popper 1963; and Spence 1982.) Even for the scientifically scrupulous neither of these objections should disqualify Freudian work from further consideration. That to this day psychoanalytically inspired approaches probably dominate that sub-field known as psychological anthropology is testimony to the suggestiveness of Freud's ideas. The point is simply that such proposals have remained sufficiently problematic (either conceptually or empirically) that they have not emerged as the vanguard of a progressive research program within scientific psychology for ex plaining aspects of either culture or religion. If scientifically productive commerce between cultural and reli gious studies and that side of psychology inspired by clinical experi ence has been unimpressive in the twentieth century, experimental psychology has had even less to offer, at least until the last three decades. For the previous fifty years behaviorism in one of its forms or another had dominated experimental psychology. No movement in psychology has been less suited to collaborate with the sociocul tural sciences. Repulsed by the vagaries of the introspectionist psychology that dominated at the turn of the century and encouraged by the logical positivists' account of the meanings of scientific terms, which re quired the semantic reduction of theoretical concepts to exclusively observational foundations, most behaviorists sought either the elimi nation of standard theoretical concepts—in psychology these are typically mentalistic concepts—or their exhaustive explication in terms of observable behavior. Behavioral psychology, in effect, aimed</page><page sequence="12">152 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY to purge itself of as much theory as possible, since theoretical claims introduce both vaguenesses and substantive commitments that go well beyond the data. Some behaviorists (e.g., Tolman 1967) argued for the importance of such theoretical notions for the adequate de scription of behavior and some logical empiricists (e.g., Hempel 1965) recognized that it is precisely such conceptual flexibility and leaps beyond the facts that are the critical contributions of theorizing to scientific progress, but both groups simply proposed greater tolerance and continued to operate within the dominant paradigms of their respective disciplines. More radical critics of both behavioral psychol ogy (such as Chomsky 1959 and Brewer 1974) and the underlying philosophy of science (such as Quine 1953; Popper 1959; and Kuhn 1970) helped to foment the transformation of these fields over the past thirty years. Whatever the liabilities that plague psychoanalytic schemes, Freudian ideas have generated a steady stream of explanatory pro posals in religion and anthropology. By contrast, behaviorists' be grudging attitudes toward theoretical expansiveness have rendered their conceptual frameworks virtually worthless to students of culture. Their findings have generally proven no more helpful. As with any rigorously experimental science, both classical and operant conditioning depend upon experimenters maintaining tight control over extremely simple environments. This usually assures both the replicability and the clarity of results. But as humanists and anthropologists of virtually all stripes have hastened to note, neither human beings nor their everyday environments are so simple or so easy to control. Psychology is unlikely to provide anthropologists or scholars of religion with helpful insights into cultural and religious matters, if its explanatory accomplishments turn so fundamentally on stripping the environment of most of its cultural or religious interest. Behaviorism's fifty year reign in experimental psychology thor oughly thwarted whatever grip inventive experimentalists might have achieved on such fronts. The simplified environments its investigative methods required served only to obstruct the development of an experimental psychology of religion. Its anti-theoretical penchant also impeded the formulation of theories capable of bridging psycho logical findings and larger cultural patterns. (On this count even the most tough-minded champions of scientific approaches owe a debt of gratitude to Freud.) Behaviorism's dominance insured that the psy chology of religion remained at the extreme periphery of experimen</page><page sequence="13">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 153 tal psychology and that general questions about the connections be tween psychology and culture did not often arise. An important part of anthropology's business is simply cataloguing the details of diverse cultures. If cultural explanation is a possibility, it should come as no surprise that anthropologists would be interested in explanatory theories that identify and connect patterns amidst the variability of those details. For a large part of this century cultural anthropologists and scholars of religion judged correctly that the domi nant school of experimental psychology offered them few useful re sources. Of course, behaviorism's methodological restrictions were not the only obstacles to experimental work in the psychology of religion. In fact, in experimental psychology's initial decades many important figures, such as Wundt, Galton, and James, had considerable interest in the psychology of religion. But sociocultural systems of this sort have proven among the most difficult beasts science has ever aimed to tame. They do not easily succumb to experimentation, test, or control. The study of such systems presents numerous problems, be ginning with the problem of even clarifying what they are. Religions, for example, are not physical things. They are also not spatially localizable. Much about them is not readily observable. They seem ineliminably symbolic. They undergo gradual but constant change. Even at any one point in time they seem to encompass considerable variability both in form and content. Thus, as noted earlier, indi viduating one from another is no simple task. Religion is people and their practices, their mental states, their actions, their symbols, their communities, their sacred texts, and more. A religious system is al ways larger than all of its parts, but it also involves individual experi ence at its core. That has always seemed the natural opening for experimental psychology's entry into the study of religion. Still, obvious problems persist. Religious experiences are not read ily elicited in psychological laboratories. The impact of prayer, even on the prayer, is a difficult thing to judge, let alone measure. (Gould 1981: 75) Extended rituals introduce more variables than any psy chologist is likely ever to be able to control. For a host of reasons having to do with its character, its eliciting conditions, its special cultural status, and more, religious experience, perhaps more than any other culturally defined experience, does not readily submit to the techniques of psychological experimentation and test. The very nature of the beast poses significant obstacles to rigorous scientific</page><page sequence="14">1 54 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY study. Thus, it should come as little surprise that for nearly a hun dred years The Varieties of Religious Experience remains the single most influential work in the field or that James' approach in that book falls short of the standards that characterize experimental science. The force of the previous sentence is congratulatory, not dismiss ive. James conscientiously catalogues the enormous variety of experi ences reported in the history of religions—including everything from the extremes of religious asceticism to chloroform-induced mystical states! He examines and evaluates numerous explanatory proposals, and he advances hypotheses of his own, concerning especially the priority of feeling over cognition in religious experience and the close relation of many forms of religious experience to the "transmarginal or subliminal region" of consciousness. (1902/1929: 473) Sorting through the immense collection of materials James surveys has remained the task of subsequent generations of researchers. As we have already noted, most have brought clinically inspired interests and theories to bear on these materials. Throughout the twentieth century the exploration of religious materials in experimental psy chology has remained a largely peripheral enterprise. Much of the work that has been done, though, retains two features of James' discussion that we suspect has discouraged the development and elaboration of psychological hypotheses as a means of gaining insight into religious systems. The first is James' presumption that religious experience is fundamentally affective. James states that ... you suspect that I am planning to defend feeling at the expense of reason, to rehabilitate the primitive and unreflective .... To a certain extent I have to admit that you guess rightly. I do believe that feeling is the deeper source of religion, and that philosophic and theological formulas are secondary products. (1902/1929: 422) The point is not that these claims are false. (Indeed, Justin Barrett and Frank Keil's [1996] studies suggest that substantial conceptual dis tance separates most subjects' avowed formal, theological concep tions of God and a much more anthropomorphic conception utilized in their "on-line" reasoning.) Rather the point is that James' focus on the place of emotion in religious experience invites just the sort of reductionistic analyses that cultural anthropologists disdain. Neuro science has probably made more progress in the explanation of emo tion than in any other area of human experience. Not only cultural considerations but psychological ones as well are largely subordinated in neurophysiological analyses of emotional states.</page><page sequence="15">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 155 The second feature of James' treatment that has probably inhib ited the development of general psychological theories about patterns of religious experience turns on his distinction between original and "second-hand religious life". At the outset of Varieties James declares: I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer, who follows the conventional observances . . . His religion has been made for him by others, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by imitation, and retained by habit. It would profit us little to study this second-hand religious life. We must make search rather for the original experiences which were the pattern-setters to all this mass of suggested feeling and imitated conduct. (1902/1929: 7-8, emphasis added) James advocates focusing on the extraordinary over the ordinary, a focus inspired by James' metaphysical interests, but, unfortunately, a focus that raises three closely related problems for psychological re search. First, it deters the collection and analysis of data from populations, which is the most popular and successful research strategy in experi mental psychology. It is extremely difficult to gather data about those whose experience is "original" in James' sense. Even if James' distinc tion between original and second-hand experience can be made out precisely (we suspect that it cannot) and even if it tracks some critical variable (we suspect that it does not), inevitably, much, if not most, of the available data is anecdotal, idiosyncratic, and painfully incom plete (from the standpoint of testing relevant hypotheses). The second problem results directly from the first. A focus on the details of extreme or unusual or even aberrant cases does not abet either the formulation or the testing of general, widely applicable theoretical principles. Typically in science the atypical serves as a reservoir of information for evaluating hypotheses about some mechanism's normal functioning. (Consider, for example, the place of lesion studies in research on the brain [see Churchland and Church land 1996].) By contrast, James eschews hypothesizing about normal cases. Whatever the interest and appeal of James' catalogue of ex traordinary religious sensibilities, it is unclear how generally applica ble the findings will prove. If James' suspicions are right that every day religious experiences are distant, "second-hand" versions of "original" religious experience, then it is also not at all obvious why analyses of the latter should illuminate the former. This is the cost of focusing on the exotic and the extraordinary. This leads straightaway to a third problem. James seems to hold</page><page sequence="16">156 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY that most everyday religious experience is but a pale imitation of the originating experiences of the religiously gifted. This may well be, but if it is so, then James himself has provided grounds for skepticism about its relevance to enhanced understanding of conventional pat terns of religious behavior, which, crucially, constitute the vast majority of people's religious experiences. When psychologists of religion adopt James' strategy of studying the varieties of (extraordinary) reli gious experience, they constantly risk doing so at the cost of studying most of religious experience. These three concerns jointly suffice to justify considering addi tional psychological approaches to the study of religion. Our own proposal is to reverse these two emphases in James' work, i.e., to examine cognitive (as opposed to affective) dimensions of commonplace (as opposed to extraordinary) patterns of religious behavior and expe rience. That said, though, the question still remains as to what form such investigations should take. 3. Advantages of a competence approach to religious materials The decisive turn in experimental psychology away from behaviorism could be generally characterized as a turn toward the construction and evaluation of hypotheses about minds. Minds, however, may not seem any more accessible to systematic study than cultural systems. The most important methodological accomplishment of the cognitive sciences and of the so-called "cognitive revolution" in experimental psychology is precisely their success in showing ways minds are acces sible to scientific study. The flourishing of the cognitive sciences over the past two decades has amply illustrated just how models of the mind are empirically (and experimentally) tractable. But while minds may be easier to study, it remains to be seen whether they are appropriate things to study when the ultimate ob jects of explanation are cultural phenomena. The argument for that claim comes with the recognition that human minds are the reposi tories of extensive knowledge about sociocultural systems. This gen eral approach holds that if sociocultural systems, like natural lan guages or religious systems or systems of etiquette, so resist scientific scrutiny (for the standard reasons having to do with their complexity, scale, amorphousness, diffuseness, and so on), then a good place to look for further evidence about their character is in the minds of individual participants familiar with those systems. If the systems are</page><page sequence="17">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 157 hard to handle, perhaps, participants' knowledge of those systems will prove easier to corral. If all of the critical knowledge these participants possess were avail able to them consciously, then only the jobs of collecting it and organizing it theoretically would remain. Many of the pertinent knowledge structures, though, are neither consciously entertained nor consciously accessible. Native speakers of a language, for example, usually have little or no sense of what knowledge structures or cogni tive processes inform their facility with the syntax of their language. Their knowledge of such systems is held "tacitly", i.e., it is held almost completely unreflectively below the level of consciousness. (Chomsky 1972) It is only when we attempt to learn some foreign language that we realize both how complex syntax is and how diffi cult it is to master when relying heavily on conscious processing. The overwhelming majority of the time speakers do not con sciously aim to speak or write grammatically.1 They just do it "with out thinking". (The same goes for experienced practitioners vis-a-vis their religious rituals.) Nor are speakers typically capable of either pronouncing upon purported grammatical principles or proposing ones of their own. Such principles are usually not objects of our conscious, intentional states. Instead, researchers elicit participants' intuitions about particular cases (both real and hypothetical ones) and can use that information to shape their hypotheses about the language's underlying principles. A central claim of our project is that on most fronts a participant's competence with a religious ritual system constitutes a parallel state of affairs to the linguistic case. Participants in religious ritual systems possess a similar sort of tacit knowledge concerning the constraints on the well-formedness of their religious rituals. Like speakers of a lan guage, they have acquired much, if not most, of this knowledge with out explicit instruction. Moreover, they have the same sort of intui tive access to normative judgments about such matters, even though 1 Its currency notwithstanding, grammaticality is almost certainly too strong a standard to employ here for two reasons. First, from a practical standpoint, the critical question usually is whether or not an audience comprehends the speaker's utterance well enough to respond in the fashion the speaker desires. This criterion for the acceptability of an utterance often falls a good deal short of what we typically regard as grammatical usage. Second, from a theoretical standpoint, "grammaticality" carries connotations that are chiefly syntactic. Often, though, speakers' normative judgments about the acceptability of linguistic strings do not turn exclusively on syntactic considerations.</page><page sequence="18">158 ROBERT N. MCCAULEY they are commonly as unaware of the principles and processes that inform these judgments as speakers are of the grammatical principles that inform their linguistic intuitions. All of this is to say that both natural languages and religious ritual systems are what Lawson and I (1990: 2-3) have called "symbolic cultural systems". Both are organized, supra-individual systems of practices and patterns in participants' conduct, utterances, and be liefs about which they are capable of rendering largely similar judg ments concerning a huge range of cases and features, even though they are mostly unaware of the bases for those judgments. The methodological question is how scientists can gain knowledge of these cognitive, even if not-always-conscious, processes and states. The methodological recommendation is that instead of focusing on either the emotional or the extraordinary character of religious expe riences, as so many researchers have in the experimental psychology of religion, or opting out of the science business altogether (as so many cultural anthropologists have), scholars concerned with the import of the psychological dimensions of religion should look to the cognitive revolution for inspiration. Specifically, I am suggesting that other sociocultural systems and religious ritual systems, in particular, may fruitfully submit to a com petence approach to theorizing at the sub-personal level. The proxi mal goal of such a theory is to outline a simple, unified system of principles that will account both for the pattern and character of the indefinitely large set of judgments participants can make about the forms of their religious rituals and for the relative uniformity of a vast number of those judgments across informants. The theory's ultimate goal is to explain something of the pattern and character of partici pants' actual conduct. Such an approach to religious ritual systems circumvents two fea tures that frequently arise in much research in standard psychology of religion and, as noted in the previous section, that often seem to impede theoretical and empirical progress. There, recall, I noted that ever since James, even psychologists of religion with experimental interests have highlighted [1] emotional rather than cognitive dimen sions of religious experience and, frequently, [2] the religious experi ences of extraordinary rather than ordinary participants in religious systems. A competence theory at the sub-personal level takes a very differ ent approach. Proceeding at the sub-personal level, our theory pro</page><page sequence="19">OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO A COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY 159 poses an array of woreconscious states and processes. Consequently, it offers some relief from worries about doing justice to the experiential nuances of each new manifestation of religiosity. Moreover, our theory of religious ritual competence focuses primarily on cognitive rather than emotional aspects of religious experience. Competence theories seek to explain judgments about the forms of sociocultural events in terms of cognitive structures. Nor are competence theories plagued by worries of generalizability due to a preoccupation with the extraordinary. Theories of compe tence aim to describe knowledge held in common by virtually all participants in a symbolic-cultural system. Those theories' ultimate goal is to account for normal functioning within some symbolic cultural system, consequently, they concentrate on general rather than singular knowledge structures. A theory of religious ritual competence will contribute to our un derstanding of religious ritual behavior, because the performance of religious ritual, unlike linguistic performance, typically involves the interference of far fewer "irrelevant conditions" than does linguistic performance. The primary reason is that the toleration of variation in religious ritual performance is much less than it is with language use. Consequently, considerations extraneous to religious ritual form are less likely to arise. My argument, then, is not that our current theory of religious ritual competence provides any finer grained account of the actual cognitive representations participants employ, but rather that the "central range" of "stable states of the system" for which a competence theory is "descriptively adequate" will include a much greater proportion of the relevant cases overall. This substantially narrows the gap between religious ritual competence and religious ritual behaviors. Whether narrowing that gap will aid in narrowing the gap between a theory of religious ritual competence and the cognitive processing associated with religious ritual behaviors is unclear. If it does, though, it will certainly depend upon a continuing co-evolution of compe tence, performance, and processing accounts. My goal is, precisely, to initiate that co-evolution by illustrating how our theory has identified the critical variables that explain sev eral aspects of religious ritual performance. Whether this will justify any strong presumptions about psychological processes or not, it will exhibit the sort of productive interplay between a competence theory</page><page sequence="20">1 60 ROBERT N.
