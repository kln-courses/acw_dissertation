<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Actors" of Modern Society: The Cultural Construction of Social Agency* JOHN W. MEYER Stanford University RONALD L. JEPPERSON University of Tulsa Much social theory takes for granted the core conceit of modern culture, that modern actors-individuals, organizations, nation states-are autochthonous and natural enti- ties, no longer really embedded in culture. Accordingly, while there is much abstract metatheory about "actors" and their "agency," there is arguably little theory about the topic. This article offers direct arguments about how the modern (European, now glo- bal) cultural system constructs the modern actor as an authorized agent for various interests via an ongoing relocation into society of agency originally located in tran- scendental authority or in natural forces environing the social system. We see this authorized agentic capability as an essentialfeature of what modern theory and culture call an "actor," and one that, when analyzed, helps greatly in explaining a number of otherwise anomalous or little analyzed features of modern individuals, organizations, and states. These features include their isomorphism and standardization, their inter- nal decoupling, their extraordinarily complex structuration, and their capacity for pro- lific collective action. 1. INTRODUCTION Modern culture depicts society as made up of "actors"-individuals and nation-states, together with the organizations derived from them. Much social science takes this de- piction at face value, and takes for granted that analysis must start with these actors and their perspectives and actions. We refer for instance to elaborate interest-based theories so committed to assuming actorhood that they leave its actual properties unanalyzed. Modern actors are seen as autochthonous and natural entities, no longer really embedded in culture (Meyer 1988). Out of the unspecified core of actorhood emanate the utilities and preferences said to produce the entire social world. In the background of such analyses one sometimes finds mention of prior cultural rules-for example, a system of property rights in part culturally derived-but these rules are typically presented as preconditions, operating mainly at some earlier point in history. The modern social sys- tem at present is imagined to operate via fully realized and unfettered actors pursuing their goals (if under institutional "incentives" and "constraints," understood as back- ground conditions). *An original version of this article was prepared for a conference on institutional analysis at the University of Arizona, March 1996. We appreciate the support of the Institute for International Studies at Stanford University in its preparation and the comments of Al Bergesen, John Boli, Thomas Fararo, David Frank, Edgar Kiser, Walter W. Powell, Francisco Ramirez, Evan Schofer, participants in the Arizona conference, and anonymous reviewers. We also draw upon previous discussions with Shmuel Eisenstadt, Ann Swidler, and Morris Zelditch, Jr. Sociological Theory 18:1 March 2000 ?

Standard culturalist imagery departs only somewhat from this vision. It often features a dramatic emphasis on human voluntarist interpretation and action (Alexander 1986; Sewell 1992), but it also provides little specification of what the modern agent is like. Such scholars add attention to "meanings," but often seem to assume, we think erroneously, that they arise out of the raw (untutored, unscripted) social experi- ence of actors. In so doing, these scholars often underplay the highly constructed, scripted, and legitimated character of modern actorhood-despite their emphasis on culture. Accordingly, there is more abstract metatheory about "actors" and their "agency" than substantive arguments about the topic. This characterization is arguably valid even if one takes into account European discussions, which have perhaps been more attentive to the constructed features of actorhood, and less prone to reify actors. In social theory generally, modern actorhood is routinely treated as a given condition or attainment-or even a uni- versal telos of human or social nature. Assumptions about actorhood are now so taken for granted that social scientists use the term "actor" with little reflexivity to denote people or organized groups, as if such entities are by definition actors. In this article, in contrast, we take seriously the idea that the modern "actor" is a his- torical and ongoing cultural construction, and that the particulars of this construction should help to account for a number of specific features of actorhood, including anomalous and unnoticed ones. We offer direct social theory taking up this topic. In doing so, we depend upon two main analytical departures. First, we see the actorhood of individuals, organizations, and national states as an elab- orate system of social agency that has a long and continuing religious and postreligious evolution.2 Our main theme on this issue concerns the ongoing relocation into society of agency originally located in transcendental authority (gods) or in natural forces environing the social system. Over time these exogenous forces (e.g., godly powers) have been relo- cated as authority immanent within society itself, enlarging social agency, relocating author- ity from god to church, from church to state, from church and state to individual souls and later citizens. Recognizing the spiritual immanence of Western societies (as Durkheim did) will help us see the development of modern actorhood as more a cultural devolution- from god to society, on to individuals and organizations-than a natural evolution from less to more social complexity, or an aggregate product of interest-based struggles over naturally given goals. Second, we call attention to the ways in which this cultural system constructs the mod- ern actor as an authorized agent for various interests (including those of the self). This agentic construction, we will argue, accounts for much of the uniqueness of modern actor- hood. Notably, participants in modern society enact in their identities substantial agency for broad collective purposes. Under the terms of a wider rationalized and universalistic 'As indicated, by "realism" we invoke a contrast with more "phenomenological" or "constructivist" imagery. The underlying analytical dimension demarcates the degree to which units or relations under analysis are thought to be relatively generic (i.e., not very historically or contextually specific in "realist" imagery) versus highly constructed (i.e., quite historically or contextually generated); see Thomas, Meyer, Ramirez, and Boli (1987, chap. 1); Jepperson (1991). "Realism" also often entails actor-centric arguments that see activity as controlled by tightly connected incentives and resources. These may arise from the purposes of actors themselves (who may be conceived to be hard-wired [natural] systems [e.g., rational actors]), or from purposes built into wider networks or systems of control. 2By "agency" we refer to legitimated representation of some legitimated principal, which may be an individual, an actual or potential organization, a nation-state, or abstract principles (like those of law or science, or more prosaically, high culture or even etiquette). Note that the concept "agency" directly draws attention to the dev- olution of external authority, and to the external legitimation and chartering of activity. We draw the concept from the standard principal/agent contrast, though we broaden the typical usage. 101</page><page sequence="3">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY culture, they are constructed as having the capacity and responsibility to act as an "other" to themselves, to each other, and indeed for the wider cultural frame itself (as with Mead's "generalized other"). We see this authorized agentic capability as an essential feature of what modern theory calls an "actor." In Section 2 we sketch the continuously evolving cultural rules that construct, maintain, and elaborate actors. Section 3 analyzes the types of agency that the modern actor takes up. Section 4 locates the origins of this system of agency in the modern, especially liberal, polity. Section 5 then derives a number of propositions about common structural and dynamic features of modern individuals, states, and organizations-the similarities of the three types of actors itself both motivation and subject for our analysis. In this section we also present propositions about a number of structural features of modern society as a distinctive action system. In undertaking this analysis we apply and elaborate one line of contemporary sociolog- ical theory, so-called sociological institutionalism (Thomas, Meyer, Ramirez, and Boli 1987). We purposefully employ the theoretical and empirical resources of this research program rather than attempting to synthesize or address other contemporary theoretical efforts. 3 2. THE CULTURAL RULES OF MODERN ACTORHOOD We first address the question: What are the cultural rules that constitute agentic actorhood in the first place and that subsequently structure it? We attempt to isolate and explicate rules of actorhood located within the modern Western cultural framework. (We do not attempt to offer an explanation of their origins or development, or a commentary upon such explanations.4) It is routinely noted (but as often forgotten) that the Western cultural framework reflects the development, expansion, and secularization of the principally religious models of West- ern Christendom, a sustained cultural evolution extending into the human rights move- ments of the contemporary period (Weber 1927; Parsons 1966; McNeill 1963; Eisenstadt 1986, 1987; Mann 1986; Hall 1986; Thomas et al. 1987; Meyer 1989). These models involve a sharp delineation of, and "axial tension" (Eisenstadt 1986) between, society and its natural and spiritual environments. This differentiation is historically associated with the distinctive ongoing "rationalization" 5 of cultural representations of nature, the spiri- tual domain, and society. In the Western picture, humans have the capacity and responsibility to modify society and to intervene in lawful nature, in order to reduce discrepancies between mundane real- ities and transcendentally chartered goals (Eisenstadt 1986). Further, the resolution for 3We should note that we see our discussion as solidaristic with some European efforts. Foucault's work (and related work) on technologies of the self is obviously directly relevant (Foucault 1979, 1990; Miller and Rose 1994; Miller and O'Leary 1987), with the idea that specific features of actorhood are generated by specific institutional structures. In this article we attend less to specific meso-institutional structures (such as prisons, asylums, clinics) and more to the basic institutional matrix of the modern Western polity. Most theorists have used agency more as a means of isolating cultural rule systems, rather than studying the basic parameters of agentic actorhood as a topic in itself (e.g., Bourdieu [1977] has used agency as a theoretical entry in this way). We recognize that Luhmann (1982) developed an elaborate system theory of types of action in different institutional systems. We hesitate to position our work vis-a-vis his, except to say that Luhmann did not to our knowledge focus directly on the specifically agentic features of modern actorhood. 4For a complementary explanatory sketch, see Meyer (1989). 5By "rationalization" we refer (conventionally) to the cultural accounting of society and its environments in terms of articulated, unified, integrated, universalized, and causally and logically structured schemes (Weber 1927; Parsons 1966; Kalberg 1994). 102</page><page sequence="4">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION this "axial tension" is to be this-worldly, attained through the joint transformation of soci- ety and the individual. Society is instrumentalized as a modifiable vehicle for salvation (later, progress and justice) (Bellah 1964; Thomas and Meyer 1984), but in the Western tradition it is the cultural project that is sacred, not some specific control structure in itself. The contrast with China in this respect, from an early historical period, is striking (Weber 1927; Needham 1954; Eisenstadt 1986, 1987). The spiritual environment in the Western ontology is increasingly simplified and abstract over time, consolidated in a high god who is rendered eternal, lawful, and relatively non- invasive in both nature and society-and thus not what moderns would consider much of an actor. The natural environment in this ontology is represented as unified and lawful, and over time is purged of animist or spiritual forces; it is deadened, and again not filled with what moderns would call actors. The modern cultural dramatics of human actorhood- what Weber called the "rational restlessness" of the modern system-are in good part a precipitate or devolution of these distinctive cultural properties. The Rationalization of Representations of Nature In Western culture, nature is tamed and demystified through the extraordinary develop- ment, expansion, and authority of science. Nature is represented by elaborate lawfully defined entities set in imagined lawful relation to each other; the laws involved are held to be universally binding rather than culture-specific. More and more domains are in- corporated over time into this cognitive system: psyches, elements of human society, the ecosystem, the forces of the history of the universe and its current physical operation, the evolution of life, species, and human language. Animist and spiritual forces are mar- ginalized or purged, relative to other cultural ontologies (e.g., ancestor spirits disappear from nature). This process is a continuing one, and to this day one finds new rationaliza- tions of previously opaque entities and relations: for instance, particularistic conceptions of life, the earth, and the human race are undercut by discoveries of life in rocks from Mars and far inside the earth, of new planets and stars, of more details of primate evo- lution, and so on. Or human behavior previously seen as arbitrary is given analysis in terms of psychological, medical, or environmental bases. To be sure, pseudo- and nonscientific spiritualisms and naturalisms remain as core elements of the cultural ontol- ogy (as we discuss below), but they are under constant encroachment and displacement by putatively scientific accounts, which then routinely receive public authoritativeness and standing. This cultural development has been globalized to an astonishing degree, so that the "scientific outlook" has public authority in most parts of the world, with scientists attain- ing substantial public (even philosophic) standing in world culture. In most versions of high modernity, the scientific outlook in fact comes to define both rationality and the progressive society, with obviously enormous effects. Responsible individual and social actors are to take scientific knowledge into account in their activities; in fact, doing so becomes, in an ever-broadening array of world regions, a desideratum of rational behavior (Inkeles and Smith 1974). Individual persons, including business and political leaders, may privately have little scientific knowledge or faith. Rou- tinely they have idiosyncratic, syncretic, mixtures of beliefs, privately consulting all sorts of carriers of spiritual or mystical authority, medical functionaries far removed from sci- entific grounding, and so on. Scientists themselves declare religious beliefs, but these private belief systems are no longer adequate bases for the posture of proper rational modern actorhood. A competent defense in a trial court or a legislative hearing, or before the court of public opinion, must claim that one's actions were guided by the best scientific 103</page><page sequence="5">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY and professional advice: the claim that one acted under advice from a palm reader has little standing.6 The rationalization of the picture of nature creates some of the elements of modern actorhood. This rationalization creates a constantly expanding set of recognized entities with their functional interrelations and often associated legitimated "interests." New ele- ments and functions are recognized, such as wetlands, species diversity, the functions of the rain forest, the declining whale population, scarce or dangerous metals, and so on. Some of these entities can be seen as having interests that require protection or recogni- tion: one can now argue for the rights of whales, or of species in general, or even of geological forms (as in the Gaia movement). Shifting from functional analyses of nature to ideas about rights moves beyond simple scientific rationalization, and obviously adds moral elements. But the underlying rationalized scientific analysis is almost always a crucial component of these rights claims: It is much easier to argue for rights for whales if one also has an analysis of whales' sentient qualities or their crucial roles in an ecology. New properties and interests are also discovered in aspects of human society that are represented as being rooted in nature. For instance, new natural properties of the individ- ual, and thus potential rights, are conceived (e.g., self-esteem). New laws and functions defining society are articulated (economic and social development, the costs of dependen- cy), producing definitions of new rights and interests. And new elements of social organi- zation acquire analytic standing, producing organizations that may claim legitimate interests and rights (for women, ethnic groups, the physically limited, fetuses, and also such func- tionally defined groups as occupations and professions). Thus the rationalization of nature and the rationalization of society are highly interpen- etrated. Proper human activity and social organization must take into account the imagined lawful entities and relations in the natural environment (including the natural laws thought to govern human individuals and social organization, as proclaimed by the psychological and social sciences). But the enriched analysis of nature, in this broad sense, also provides agendas for expanded rational human activity: new analyses create a constant flow of new social problems and possibilities (see Schofer 1999). Implicit in much realist theoretical imagery is the idea that the processes of rational- ization of nature and society more or less inevitably produce the phenomenon of actor- hood. For instance, differentiated individuals in a complex society are thought naturally to acquire individual consciousness and actorhood (Simmel, and many others). Differenti- ated structures in a complex environment are thought naturally to produce formal organi- zational actors through pressures for efficiency or stability (e.g., North and Thomas 1973). World or regional complexity, differentiation, and conflict are thought to produce naturally the nation-state as a rational actor (Tilly 1992; Wallerstein 1974). Putting aside the particulars of such analyses, the underlying assumption seems funda- mentally mistaken. The rationalization of nature does produce an expanded set of recog- nized entities and relations. In the social domain, these may be entities accorded with natural functions that have the character of social rights, but they are not yet actors. Whales may be accorded rights of a sort, and validated human actors may represent these rights (as we discuss below), but whales are not actors. Nor are the ethnic cultures displayed in 6We are focusing upon scientism-to science as a powerful post-Enlightenment ideology-rather than the actual scientific practices problematized by the "science studies" literature (e.g., Latour 1987; Barnes, Bloor, and Henry 1996). Concern for these meso- and microlevel features of science in principle complement our macro- scopic ones. In fact, the ways in which the disorder and interestedness of actual scientific activity are cloaked in modern society-so stressed by the "science studies" literature-is a natural product of the extreme legitimacy and prestige of science in the modern polity. This status generates the loose coupling of image and doctrine to actual practice, in ways analyzed in the institutionalist literature about organizations (e.g., Meyer and Scott 1983). 104</page><page sequence="6">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION museums, or fetuses, or interest groups not yet formally organized (e.g., labor or women in premodern societies). For an entity with recognized interests to be seen as a legitimate actor requires another step: the cultural construction of the capacity and authority to act for itself. We argue that in the modern system, this capacity comes from the wider cultural system, and can best be seen as the cultural devolution of originally spiritual agency. The Rationalization of Representations of the Spiritual World, and the Rise of the Agentic Actor As with the natural world, the spiritual one has been highly rationalized in the Western ontology. There has been a remarkably continuous unification, generalization, and taming of the spiritual domain and spiritual authority (a process discussed by both Durkheim and Weber; also by Bellah 1964; Collins 1982, chap. 2.; Eisenstadt 1986; Thomas et al. 1987). Spiritual forces have been progressively consolidated into a single high god, in a relatively linear religious evolution. In a strikingly stepwise way, god "takes leave of time and space" (Durkheim), and its anthropomorphic qualities decline. God does not so much die (con- trary to Nietzsche), but is deadened in the sense of greatly reduced agency. This evolution continues in the contemporary period, with the reconstruction of god as basic principles (as evidenced, for instance, in much modern religious thought of the high culture sort, or in "the force" of Star Wars). Further, in the modern Western ontology, there is an ongoing diminishment of the domain under direct transcendental-spiritual control. This domain becomes more truly transcendental over time, with the pullout of god from society. It is also highly rational- ized, as in the ongoing and aggressive search for more common and universal principles of justice and morality (as in modern attempts to create and elaborate global conceptions of "human rights" and to implement them in legal systems [Boyle and Meyer 1998]). With the increasing transcendence and inertness of god, agency and authority are relo- cated immanently in society's structures and rationales. Some agency is built into modern pictures of the agentic authority and responsibility of the state and other organizations; much devolves to the modern individual, who is empowered with more and more godlike authority and vision. Social and individual actors thereby attain greater reality and standing, and more func- tions and responsibilities-they are now agents of higher principles, and hence highly legitimated in ways unique to modern Western culture. Elaborate schemas of socioeco- nomic development become the responsibilities and purposes of nation-states. These states are truly projects in ways far more elaborated than for other polities (Thomas and Meyer 1984). The status of the individual as responsible creature and carrier of purpose and the moral law is greatly enhanced (McNeill 1963; Hall 1986; Dumont 1986; Thomas et al. 1987). Individuals attain sacral standing across more and more dimensions: age, sex, race, ethnicity, sexuality, physical limitations. Accordingly they enact both more self and more public standing than do people outside the modern system (Inkeles and Smith 1974; Jep- person 1992). Structured social organizations arise to pursue, with great legitimacy, vali- dated individual and collective purposes and responsibilities. Whole societies are reconstructed around a network of historically distinctive rationalized purposive associa- tions (Coleman 1973). Individuals and societies together are seen as the authorized centers and sources of all social action (hence the dominance of actor and action theories in social science). "Man" as actor-individuals, organizations, states-carries almost the entire responsibility for the now-sacralized human project, with gods, other spiritual forces, ances- tors, or an animated nature drained of agency. We should note that all this cultural development has been globalized to a very sub- stantial (in fact, astonishing) degree in the period following World War II. First, both the 105</page><page sequence="7">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY cultural system and the associated roster of agentic actors have expanded on a nearly worldwide basis: The nation-state form, with individuals as citizens, and organizations as components, is found worldwide. Second, while there are attempts in Asia and the Islamic world to limit the spread of models originating in the West, a surprising feature of the modern system is how completely the Western models dominate world discourse about the rights of individuals, the responsibilities and sovereignty of the state, and the nature of preferred organizational forms. One can as yet find little impact of other huge civilizational forces (China, Islam) on the standardized rule structures found in those institutions, organizations, and associations operating on a world scale (see, e.g., Meyer, Boli, Thomas, and Ramirez 1997). Third, and most recently, the various formal "others" of this system-collectives representing sciences, professions, and rational- ized world associations-explicitly deploy the expanded standards and putative truths as collective culture for the world, with substantial influence (Boli and Thomas 1999). In effect, Christendom had some modest attainments as a missionary movement, but has achieved vastly greater hegemony in its transformation into science, law, and rationalized education. The Resulting Identity of "The Actor" We have discussed what seem to be the essential cultural ingredients of modern actor- hood. First, stemming from the rationalization of the realm of nature, and of aspects of humans and human society seen as of nature, one finds the natural human entity with valid and lawful functions and interests. This is the human individual or group that can be represented as behaving in terms of natural (scientifically expressible) laws. Second, devolving from rationalized spiritual authority, one finds the legitimated agent and car- rier of authority, responsibility, and capacity to act in history. The integration of these two elements in a single imagined natural-and-spiritual entity is what moderns mean by the term "actor." 3. FEATURES OF THE AGENTIC ACTOR The constructed capacity for responsible agency is the core of modern actorhood. In this section we try to isolate the different sorts of agency that constitute modern actors. We distinguish agency for a self, for other actors, for entities that are not actors, and for principle (i.e., for cultural authority). Agency for the Self The modern actor is a mobilized agent for its self (or for other "principals," as we will discuss below). Modern culture creates an agentic individual managing goals thought to reside in a personality or life course (the "principal" for individuals); a sovereign state managing goals of a national society; and an organizational structure managing its legiti- mated interests. The two cultural sources of this structure discussed above both introduce a great deal of standardization and scripting. A first aspect is widely recognized: modern cultural formulations defining individual, organizational, or state entities and interests are highly standardized, and evolve and expand in similar ways over time. For example, dis- courses of self-esteem, originally reflective of alternative lifestyles, over time transform into standard technology of the self, thereby elaborating it. The modern organization similarly has elaborated over time, with the expansion of accounting, personnel, infor- 106</page><page sequence="8">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION mation, planning, safety, and environmental elements. The modern state is agent for an expanding array of domains of national society, from economic or scientific development to education to individual health-with each domain itself conceived more expansively over time. Most social theory has recognized one way or another that core social entities have been more elaborately constructed over time. The agentic aspect and its underlying spiritual devolution is less well recognized. Modern individuals, organizations, and nation-states, in becoming legitimated agents for their underlying interests, incorporate the highly stan- dardizing responsibility to enact imagined moral and natural principles. The proper mod- ern agentic individual, for instance, manages a life, carrying a responsibility not only to reflect self-interest but also the wider rationalized rules conferring agency. Helplessness, ignorance, and passivity may be very natural human properties, but they are not the prop- erties of the proper effective agent. Modern agentic actors involve themselves in all sorts of efforts elaborating their agentic capabilities, efforts that often have only the most dis- tant relation to their raw interests. Organizations, for example, develop improved infor- mation systems toward no immediate goal (Feldman and March 1981; Brunsson 1989), or management training programs stressing individual self-development and organizational culture (Scott and Meyer 1994). Nation-states clearly devote resources to the development of agentic capabilities that are little related to their actual political agendas: for example, science policy (Finnemore 1996a), or the elaboration and celebration of internal cultural features (e.g., Hobsbawm 1983; Anderson 1991). Agency for Other Actors Assisted by elaborate structures of otherhood, individuals and collectives take up available cultural technology for developing actorhood (Brunsson 1989). Thus mobilized in stan- dardized and stylized ways, supported by a host of external cultural definitions and social structures, modern actors can easily shift from agency for the self to agency for other actors-from actorhood to otherhood-whether these other actors be states, organizations, or individuals. In fact, a striking feature of the modern system is the extreme readiness with which its actor participants can act as agents for other actors. They can do this, with rapidity and facility, as employees and consultants, as friends and advisors, as voters and citizens. They can do it in exchange for resources, or as a free good to the world around them. And they do it much more often and more easily than do participants in less rationalized cultural systems. Ready opining, on the widest range of issues, is a notable feature of modern individuals and is distinctive to them (Lerner 1959; Inkeles and Smith 1974). Organiza- tions display their successes on every occasion (rather than conceal them from their com- petitors, as in older and more typically rational behavioral forms); national states are eager to serve as models for the world around them with cascades of assistance programs, pub- licity, and displays before international organizations (Meyer et al. 1997). Since individuals and organizations and nation-states incorporate an enormous amount of standardizing rationalized material, it becomes very easy for them to put their standard- ized agency at the service of other actors. Individuals in an instant can advise others of their true interests, or can participate in complete good faith as advisors and consultants to organizations that they might have known nothing about previously. And of course they can nearly instantaneously become, as voters, agents of the greater national collectivity. Modern organizations and states have similar and more powerful agentic capabilities, and can advise and collaborate in all sorts of collective activity: they also serve as agents of their own individual members or citizens. 107</page><page sequence="9">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY Agency for Nonactor Entities Modern actors also mobilize as agents for the imagined interests of nonactor entities rec- ognized in the cultural system. For instance, individuals, organizations, and nation-states now mobilize their agency on behalf of the ecosystem, whales, trees, birds, plants, or species in general: that is, on behalf of nonactors. They similarly mobilize agency for imagined potential actors, such as fetuses, the unorganized poor, the unrecognized and unorganized groups of women or laboring classes, dying languages and cultures, and so on. The capacity to do so arises from the modern actor's imagined competence in applying natural and moral law, competence that can be put to the service of the widest variety of legitimated entities, whether the entities are themselves actors or not. Agency for Principle (i.e., for Cultural Authority) As we have discussed, the modern actor is in good part an agent operating under very general rules, and can serve as agent or consulting other for a wide variety of legitimated principals having recognized functions or interests: selves, other actor individuals or orga- nizations, entities without actorhood. But one third-party principal is in practice always involved: in becoming an authorized agent (of the self, or of any other), the proper modern actor assumes responsibility to act as agent of the imagined natural and moral law. Other- wise the actor risks either incompetence or corruption. At the extreme, agentic actors represent not any recognized entity or interest, but instead become purely agents of principle. This priestly stance is a most highly developed and respected role running through the modern system and carrying much authority in it. Thus moral and legal theorists pursue and develop abstract models independent of any practical interest, and are highly admired. Honored scientists attend to matters of presumed truth remote from any consequence: the moons of Jupiter (the matter that put Galileo in trouble once again receives attention); the origins of the universe, or of humankind, or language; attempted communication with putative intelligent life elsewhere. The authoritative voice of the sciences and professions stems from the posture of pure otherhood; that is, from their claim to speak for wider truths and standards, beyond any local situation or interests (Meyer 1994a). Prevailing social theory has little to offer in explanation of the extraordinary prestige attached to agency for principle, and (as we discuss below) very poorly accounts for the social authority of the professions and professionals involved. The prestige and authority of this form of agency become explicable if we explicitly recognize the dependence of modern actorhood on a rationalized culture of natural and moral law. The carriers of this law can be seen as crucial authorities in the maintenance of actorhood. If fostering the actorhood of states, organizations, and individuals is a crucial desideratum in the modern system, the consultants who help actors do so are prized authorities (Brunsson 1989; Meyer 1994a). 4. THE LINKAGE OF AGENTIC ACTORHOOD TO THE MODERN, ESPECIALLY LIBERAL, SYSTEM The agency system we are analyzing is very much a historical construction in the general sense already discussed: it arises from the religious and legal history of the West. It is also a construction in a more specific sense: its elaboration is tied to the liberal model of sociopolitical organization that has dominated the post-World War II epoch, with its empha- sis on individual rather than diffuse corporate or state authority, on democratic forms and 108</page><page sequence="10">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION the market economy, and so on. The dominance of the United States during the period, and the collapse of Europe (and, relatedly, corporatism) at the beginning of the period, are obviously consequential historical factors. The cultural model of the liberal system is Protestant and Anglo-American in origin but has been carried worldwide in the latter half of the twentieth century. Versions can be found throughout the global system and its organizations (e.g., the United Nations system, the World Bank, and so on). The liberal model legitimates an actor (a self or an interest) as an abstract, rather contentless, entity in social space. It also constructs a standardized agent who manages, elaborates, and standardizes that self, employing the latest cultural recipes: elaborate psychological theories for individuals (e.g., self-development [Frank, Meyer, and Miyahara 1995]), organizational theories for firms (participatory management, bud- geting systems), development theories for nation-states (neoclassical economics [Bierstek- er 1992], science management [Finnemore 1996a], welfare policies [Strang and Chang 1993]). The liberal model is distinctive in foregrounding "action," creating extensive psy- chological, biological, and organizational theory about this action, and focusing upon proper agency arrangements and enactment. Cultural devolutions other than this liberal form occurred within the broader Western tradition, producing different distributions of social agency. Some featured subunit actor- hood much less. The varying devolutions reflect secularized versions of the different reli- gious formations within Western Christendom (McNeill 1963; Jepperson and Meyer 1991). In these religious polities, and in the secularized formations that eventually built upon them, spiritual charisma could be distributed across three main locations: (a) in a central institutional complex (a monarchy, a high Church, a state); (b) in the community as an organic body (that is, in a sacralized matrix of relations [e.g., a system of corporate orders]); or (c) in spiritualized subunits (namely, individuals empowered as souls carrying respon- sibility for responsible action, whether individually or associationally). Variations in the social construction of agentic actorhood follow. If a center arrogates spiritual authority and agency, organizations and individuals (and civil society) will tend to have less autonomous agentic standing. If instead relations are more sacralized, then both the center (for instance, a state) and subunits will tend to have less charismatic standing. In the more liberal forms that became dominant in the world polity after World War II, much more charisma was located in subunits (individuals and associations in civil society), producing the system of agentic actorhood under analysis here. In each case, godly author- ity and powers devolve into social organization, but find different institutionalization. Consider for instance the more corporate Western traditions, like the Germanic and Scandinavian ones. Locating more authority and charisma in a social community as an organic body (i.e., in a relational system), they gave more substantive content to their constituent (more corporate) social entities: For instance, some organizations or corporate structures may be seen as having long-standing natural rights; theories of personality (and gender) feature more biological grounding (Jepperson 1992; Frank, Meyer, and Miyahara 1995). While this (extrasocial) content of the self (or interests) is expanded, the idea of agentic actorhood is less developed and less central. Even in the current period, after much standardizing pressure, the more corporatist national variants of the modem system (Germany, Scandinavia, Westernized Japan) more overtly specify the tasks and functions that specific entities are naturally supposed to want and do. Such corporatist arrangements tend to trap entities in explicitly articulated role and hierarchic structures, and less in scripted agency-placing more emphasis on direct train- ing, control, and discipline (Meyer 1983; Jepperson and Meyer 1991; Hofstede 1980; Laurent 1983). Insuring proper agency is a source of much uncertainty and anxiety, hence organizational theories are notoriously more power-oriented in Central Europe than in the 109</page><page sequence="11">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY Anglo-American tradition (Hofstede 1980; Laurent 1983; Crozier 1964). In contrast, the liberal system organizes more directly around agency: it is in a literal sense more an action system than a control structure (thus the notoriously loose, ill-defined, overlapping, and sprawling organizing structures of the liberal system [Meyer and Scott 1983]). Organiza- tional theories vary accordingly, with their historically distinctive emphasis on informal, tacit, associational coordination, rather than control. The individual in both these models is "embedded" in social organization, but in the more dominant liberal variant of the modern system, the individual is entrapped in stan- dardized agency more than in explicit social control schemes. Correspondingly the modern (especially liberal) individual displays more standardized "public virtues" (Dahrendorf 1967) relative to nonmoderns, and relative to elaborated private qualities. This is the flat- tened selfhood but exaggerated actorhood-in our language, the agency profile-so noted for American individuality (classically by Tocqueville; and analyzed by Dahrendorf 1967; Varenne 1977; Thomas et al. 1987; Jepperson 1992). 5. IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING FEATURES OF MODERN ACTORHOOD AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE More direct explanations of a number of features of contemporary social structure become possible if one begins with an analysis of an expanding system of social agency, with a system of constructed "actors" as its carrier. Unacknowledged agency dynamics permeate and shape modern social structure. "Actors" are agents for larger realities and larger imag- ined truths: they are in substantial part monads of a larger cultural project. Accordingly, they celebrate ideals of mobilized agency, and enter into the sweeping collective action that is distinctive to modern society. In this section we call attention first to features of modern actorhood that come into clearer relief once one attends to its agentic character. Then we bring to attention a number of features of collective authority and action that otherwise go unnoticed or are only arduously accounted for in conventional lines of argument. The Structure of the Modern Actor 1. The tension between principal and agent within the actor-between legitimated self and agency for this self-generates consequential inconsistencies and contradictions (as in any principal-agent relationship), and occasions ongoing cultural evolution. Many of the deepest contradictions of "interest" faced by modern actors are those between the interests of the underlying self and those of highly standardized and enacted agency. The underlying self has goals to pursue or interests to protect; the agent is charged to manage this interestedness effectively, but in tune with general principles and truths. This structure creates contradictions and tensions. For instance, the interests of the university as a raw actor7 involve the production of education and research at low cost; in contrast, the goals of the university as agent are to have effective management control, the maximum number of expensive professors, and the complete array of prestigious programs. In par- allel fashion, interests of the nation include socioeconomic development and the enhance- ment of individual welfare; in contrast, goals of the state as agent involve expensive structures and controls (e.g., the creation and expansion of decorative economic plans and policies, the maintenance of expensive universities) far removed from these objectives. 7By "raw actor" we intend to connote an entity pursuing rather unselfconsciously its built-in purposes-built in either through socialization or prior to socialization (e.g., by biology). These purposes can be nonlegitimated (e.g., some sexual ones), or legitimated self-interests (e.g., a person wanting a nice car). 110</page><page sequence="12">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION This same tension is dramatic for individuals, and is celebrated in classical psycholog- ical dualisms (I versus Me, long-run versus short-run interests) and in associated analyti- cal conundra (weakness of the will, self-deception, altruism, attitudes versus behavior). Individuals follow their Id (or Inner Child, or whatever) and sacrifice agentic effective- ness, or they build up their agency in canonical ways, but then lose touch with their self. To escape highly standardized agency, actors search for new authenticities or for particular- istic cultures in which to express their selves; more contradictions, and cultural evolutions, follow (e.g., therapists and consultants struggle to reconcile the demands of "the new organization" with the desiderata of personal growth). Much cultural production arises around both the principal and agent elements of actor- hood. In connection with the "principal," there are ideologies of self-development and expression for individuals, participatory and representational structures in organizational life, and rituals of authenticity in collective life (for example, democracy itself, or evolv- ing ideologies of diversity). Cultural models of legitimate selfhood or interests continually evolve, reconceptualizing what natural motives and purposes are supposed to be: for exam- ple, editing (and taming) the imagined true nature of the nation and its heritages; social- izing the true purposes of the organization; developing conceptions of the natural individual that are harmonious with responsible agency. Models of agency become ever more encompassing as well: political and organiza- tional theories of information, control, and coordination (and sometimes suppression of raw actorhood) become more elaborate; psychological models of self-management become more elaborate as well (and occupy a large share of American popular culture). Much professional work then goes into the improvement of the principal-agent linkage. As new stresses are discovered in individuals and organizations, there is further theorization and modification of the associated principal/agent technologies. All this production expands the structural complexity of the modern actor and also expands its reliance on consultation with a wide range of others. Models of the individual, the organization, and the state are all much more ramified, as is the structure of otherhood supporting the enactment of these more complex models. 2. The highly standardized and scripted nature of agency produces highly isomorphic actors. Modern actors enact highly standardizing models for agency and scripts for activity, pro- ducing two notable sorts of isomorphism. First, modern agentic actors are highly isomor- phic within actor types: people enact highly standardized individualism (Inkeles and Smith 1974; Inkeles 1983; Thomas et al. 1987; Jepperson 1992); organizations are highly (and increasingly) structurally similar (Hannan and Freeman 1989; Meyer and Rowan 1977; DiMaggio and Powell 1983); so are nation-states (see the reviews by Finnemore 1996b and Meyer et al. 1997). This phenomenon is most difficult to explain if these entities are seen as raw actors, since they vary so extremely in resources (100-to-I in the case of states) and also in backgrounds and conditions. For instance, the model of the effective modern individual is remarkably isomorphic everywhere, and people in fact come to talk and behave in similar ways when they enact these models (Inkeles and Smith 1974; Inkeles 1983). This is also true, and increasingly so, of organizations, so that management texts and consulting firms now flow rapidly into and across sectors and countries, and organizations have in fact become more isomorphic in their structures, procedures, and accounts (Meyer 1994a). Standardized models and recipes are widespread for nation-states too (e.g., UNESCO or World Bank models), and these entities have also become more isomorphic (McNeely 1995). Second, the isomorphism of the different actor elements of the modern system is also remarkable: individuals, organizations, and states reveal strikingly similar agentic struc- Ill</page><page sequence="13">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY tures and dynamics-the motivation for this paper. Despite the obvious substantive differ- ences among individuals, groups, and states, the cultural reduction of all to the agent-actor identity produces great commonalities, commonalities that have been taken for granted in most theorizing. Agentic actors at any level are to form clear boundaries and purposes, effectively integrated sovereignty, coherent control systems, and rational technologies. 3. The standardization of agency also helps to account for the decoupling of structural elements of the modern actor. Institutional lines of argument like ours have striking advantages in the explanation of the decoupling of structural elements of modern individuals and organizational actors. If these entities are in fact mobilized agents assembled within an expanding rationalistic culture, they are often laboring to enact high policies of the most elaborate and standardized forms. However, they are trying to do so with limited and highly variable resources under great local and variable constraints. Imagine, for instance, a Third World country trying to main- tain a broadly legitimated stance toward women's rights in a traditional peasant economy (Berkovitch 1999). In such a situation decoupling can understandably be extreme. For individuals, attitudes and opining will be disconnected from actual behavior (a renowned instance of decoupling that has seemed so problematic for conventional theories of personhood, yet seems such a fundamental and consequential characteristic). For orga- nizations, decision-making discourse will be disconnected from decision making, and both from action (Brunsson 1989). Nation-state constitutional claims and policies are notori- ously decoupled from local practices (Boli 1987). In all these cases, the efforts of a highly agentic actor, immersed in general principles of agency, are only loosely coupled to the structures of acting. Many specific decouplings and inconsistencies follow from this under- lying structural feature. One specific decoupling in modern individuals, insufficiently problematized, is revealed in the capacity of individuals to transition quickly from mundane experience into agency for high culture. Marx noted long ago that the Protestant revolutions transformed people into their own priests, and Tocqueville noted how the Americans he met could at a moment's notice posture as if they were advisors to the president. Such comportments seem endemic to the modern system, as when professors move from banal private experience to dispens- ing high cultural principles in their lectures, or when friends deploy the psychological wisdom of the ages to one another (independent of their own competencies). The agentic empowerment from the broader culture here seems obvious, especially in the liberal pol- ities: the modern individual carries a little piece of ex-godly agency, and has a little role in society's mission to act in history. The properly agentic actor is always partly an agent of the broader historical telos of the modern system, and its postures reveal this telos. 4. The ongoing rationalization and expansion of social agency in modern culture greatly heightens the overall structuration of modern actors. A most remarkable feature of modern actors, neglected or marginalized by most theoriz- ing, is how complexly structured they are, and how much this structuration has increased over time, and continues to increase (Meyer 1994a). Nation-states, holding constant over- all resources and basic functions, are much more elaborate than they were even a few decades ago: they have programs, ministries, and policies covering a much wider range of activities (see Finnemore [1996b] and Meyer et al. [1997] for general reviews; Barrett and Frank [1999] for population control policy; Berkovitch [1999] for policies on the status of women; Frank, Hironaka, Meyer, Schofer, and Tuma [1999] for the environment). Orga- nizations too have tended toward structural elaboration, holding constant reasonable mea- sures of size and technical complexity (Meyer 1994a; for specific examples, see Dobbin, 112</page><page sequence="14">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION Sutton, Meyer, and Scott [1993], Edelman [1990], Sutton, Dobbin, Meyer, and Scott [1994]). Older academics can easily remember a time when a university entailed the most modest personnel, accounting, legal, safety, environmental, medical, and counseling offices. The expansion in these structures is apparent in most world regions, and covers every sort of organized social sector. Similarly, the inclination of modern individuals everywhere to form plans and policies of an articulated kind seems clear, and their self-proclaimed dimen- sions and capacities, fueled by the agentic emphases of modern education, are now legion (Inkeles and Smith 1974; Inkeles 1983; Jepperson 1992; Meyer, Ramirez, and Soysal 1992). To be sure, expanded structuration partly follows from increased complexity and scale in local activities and resources, as is conventionally theorized. But holding these factors constant, structuration also follows directly from the great cultural rationalization of domains that the agentic society, and hence its responsible actors, must take into account; that is, from the elaboration of the principals and principles of proper agency. The less capable student may now be diagnosed as dyslexic, and if so, s/he should do something about it, in proper agentic fashion. Correspondingly the agentic university and nation-state should provide otherhood for such students, and incorporate proper policies. Both individual and collective goods are thereby enhanced in this process. The changes represented would proceed much more haltingly (if at all) without the high legitimation involved. The Society of Agentic Actors A society of these standardized, decoupled, complexly structured agentic actors is neces- sarily a distinctive one, quite different from a society of raw actors imagined by some realist social theorists. 1. A society of agentic actors generates an elaborate social structure of othering activity, given that the modern actor (a) shifts routinely from agency for the self into otherhood for the widest variety of other actors, and (b) is remarkably receptive to othering. (a) In an instant modern actors transform into others; they brim with rule-laden and intendedly thoughtful counsel for each other. This posturing is taken as natural both by them and their principals, with the obvious hypocrisies largely neglected and unproblematic. Modern individuals also stand ready to offer their services as agents for organized actors, as members (of organizations, of polities), and as consultants. A defining characteristic of the virtuous agentic actor is the capability to enter in good faith the structure of an organized actor, and to assume with little question its purposes. And of course modern individuals comport themselves as advisory others to whole nation-states, in their identities as citizens: they are filled with putative disinterested and relevant opinion. Relatedly, modern organizations and states assume agency responsibilities for the individuals within them, making advice available on the widest variety of topics (from mental health to childrearing). A "desire for prestige" seems patently inadequate to account for all this enact- ment of otherhood, given that it is so obviously an institutional construction. Nor is straightforward self-interest sufficient, since much othering is at odds with the more obvious actor interests. For instance, modern actors will take time from their own pursuits to advise and instruct others in general truths, or even to reveal the grounds for their successes to their competitors. This is an inexplicable phenomenon absent attention to the generalized agency of the system. (b) Note too that modern actors show extreme proclivity to avail themselves of the services of these advisory others. As the natural and spiritual environments are 113</page><page sequence="15">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY rationalized, anarchic uncertainties are tamed and transformed into rationalized uncertainties, with a myriad of others available to help proper agents deal with them. The exorbitant claims to effective and encompassing agency built into mod- ern actors make them eager markets for this othering. Three forms of otherhood have rapidly expanded. First, organized actors employ professionalized others, such as therapists or accountants or external consulting firms. Second, they show preference for employing those credentialed in the imag- ined principles of proper agency, via educational programs that are generally far removed from actual practical demands or competencies (Collins 1979; Berg 1970). Third, relatedly, actors themselves seek direct instruction in general principles of agency as much or more than training in actual practice. Consultants without direct action responsibility are found everywhere the mod- ern system reaches. Nation-states employ them and respond to their teachings in every modern policy domain, from family law, to education, medicine, and eco- nomics. Organizations structure themselves to depend upon a host of professional- ized consultants in every sector, and further, internalize the relevant professionals. And modern individuals are well known for their rampant use of such informal and formal consultancy, helping to manage the mobilization of a proper self and its deployment over an (itself standardized) life course (Meyer 1987). This ritualized and routinized otherhood might be thought to follow unproblem- atically from the interests of raw actorhood, on the assumption that the information carried by others is instrumentally useful in accomplishing actor goals. However, this representation is not very credible, for well-known empirical reasons (see, e.g., March 1988). That is, few studies can demonstrate the marginal utility of an eco- nomics consultant or a more professionally trained manager or a more highly edu- cated employee, or of a training program in the abstract principles of self- management (Berg 1970). Modern actors nevertheless employ otherhood in the absence of demonstrated utility, or even in cases of highly suspect utility. This practice becomes comprehensible if one sees the modern actor as mainly a legitimated agent for actorhood. Such an entity would obviously devote resources to the elaboration and demonstration of mobilized agency. Doing so may not help actual action-it may even interfere8-but openness to otherhood certainly helps with the construction of legitimated and accountable decisions, and for facilitating talk about rational action (Brunsson 1989). 2. The continuing scientization of nature and rationalization of the moral universe creates constant new discoveries of collective problems occasioning agentic pursuit and fueling the sweeping collective action of the modern system. There is a continuing search for integrating scientific and legal/moral principles, to respond to inconsistencies, and to enable more effective agency. Differences in economic develop- ment for instance receive explication in terms of general economic laws, and are then subject to attempted agentic control. This rationalization becomes an ongoing process, and fosters the extraordinary collec- tive action that is a continuing characteristic, and sometimes even social problem, of the modern system. Thus, the nation-states of this system have been generators of waves and waves of religious and social movements. Human "actors" turn out to be able to mobilize on a large scale around a wide variety of issues, from the welfare of songbirds (Frank et al. See Brunsson (1989) for organizations, March (1988) for individuals (and organizations), Shenhav and Kamens (1991) for states. 114</page><page sequence="16">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION 1999) to the worldwide movement for the protection of gay and lesbian rights (Frank and McEneaney 1999) to the abstract pursuit of world economic development (Chabbott 1999). The interstate system itself has been able to mobilize extraordinary levels of war and public commitment to war (notably, as with recent wars, mobilized more around abstract ideological visions than around clear raw-actor interests). Organizations have been able to pursue expansive collective visions: conventional actor theories can sometimes explain "private" behavior of this sort in terms of simple interests, but they have great difficulties explaining the worldwide rise of the various nonprofit structures of the contemporary world.9 In fact theories that see the modern system as made up of unremarkable raw actors have the greatest difficulty in explaining modern collective action in general. They tend instead to erect a supposed failure of collective action-in rather extraordinary denial of empirical evidence-as a descriptive nostrum and analytic problem. The actually massive collective action of the modern system becomes explicable if one situates the now standard "logic of collective action" (Olson 1965; Coleman 1990) within a broader logic of collective agency.'' Specific agents share in the general social agency of the system. In negotiating the defi- nitions and rules of this broader system, agents negotiate the bases of their own existence and authority. Nominally altruistic collective action can then readily be seen as the expres- sion of a self-interest on the part of agents, but it is an interest often at odds with the self-interest of the selves they are to manage. 3. Much authority for collective action, and even social status, is tied to putatively disin- terested agency for cultural standards, reflecting the peculiar structural idealism of the modern system. The great enhancement of the centrality of "disinterested" professionalized others is a notable development of modern society, one difficult to account for in terms of interests or functional requirements. (Indeed demonstrations of functionality are conspicuous for their absence.) The definers and carriers of social agency-especially those more removed from direct responsibility for mundane self-interested actorhood-are granted substantial author- ity and prominence. The most canonical authority is that of the professional who serves no actor but rather the high truths of the rationalized natural and moral universe: pure other- hood, with no tainting by any particular (i.e., partly profane) actor. In fact, the admixture of pure agency with more mundane interests by professionals is a source of minor pollution- reactions. The therapist, accountant, or lawyer who must bring agency to the service of trivial individual problems is readily seen as tawdry; the scientist who must sacrifice larger concerns with high truth for the practical good of the corporation is readily seen as partly fallen; the social or physical scientist who entertains policy demands is readily seen as a lesser figure. Naturally this system produces expansion of professionals beyond the requirements of function," and it produces the centrality of professionals in the modern system of authority- 9The recent Rio conference on the environment, for instance, found many thousands of nonprofit organizations (including hundreds of international ones) eager to participate (Frank et al. 1999; see also Boli and Thomas 1999). ?01Olson (1965) indicated that his "logic of collective action," which specifies self-limiting features of collec- tive action, might not obtain well in religious settings, among others. We are providing a rationale for this scope limitation, in part by specifying and generalizing the "religious" restriction. As we have argued, we see the cultural model of the Western system as religious in character-with substantial implications for expectations about collective action. lThe literature on professions is well-developed in its discussion of careerist interests and structures (e.g.. Friedson 1986; Starr 1982), and in the exposure of the extraordinary arbitrariness and subjectivity involved in professional work (Latour 1987). It is almost helpless in discussing the extraordinary authority of these botdies (for partial exceptions see Abbott [1988] and Parsons [1954]). Usually there is an inclination to analyze the 115</page><page sequence="17">SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY surely a core feature of modern society. Power comes from many sources in the modern system, but authority seems to flow more from the relative purity of otherhood. This relative proximity to high culture, and the putatively disinterested carrying of it, helps to account for peculiar idealist features of the modern stratification system, ones not adequately addressed in the literature (Meyer 1994b). The lowest status in this system is accorded to those categorized as simply self-interested actors; that is, those coded as merely working. A little higher are those certified agent-actors with more agency, in more ratio- nalized and universalized structures; that is, those who manage work, or (receiving more status) provide services (if often invisible ones). High status is accorded to those who do not really work at all (in any conventional sense), or even manage work, but rather serve the great exogenous cultural principles: the professionals and scientists who are often agents of no real principal (Treiman 1977). These are people who get the Nobel prizes, or more prosaically, the highest prestige ratings in surveys."2 Reflective of this cultural struc- ture, educational credentials everywhere become the master ingredient of status (with credentialism expanding in tandem with the increasing structuration of agentic actors). Further, the single biggest predictor of the relative prestige of an occupation is the educational cre- dentialing that it represents. Given this stratification system, the explosive expansion in numbers of professionals and scientists, along with professional and scientific authority (and discourse), becomes comprehensible. The inflated cultural system depicting humans and their groups as agent- actors creates a social world in which the most valued roles are those with little raw actorhood. 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION We have tried to contribute to a more substantive account of the modern actor by trying to recover a proper anthropological and historical distance from the modern system. The literatures that might actually situate such actors in history and culture-and thereby actu- ally theorize them-have been strangely peripheralized (sometimes self-peripheralized) in current discourse. Cultural and symbolic anthropology are peripheralized precisely because they are seen as dealing with highly embedded social participants, wearing masks reflect- ing the authority of the gods-rather than being proper (and properly analyzable) actors. The religious history of the West is peripheralized as dealing with cultural matters irrele- vant to the continuing operation of a world of now properly realized actors. Much political doctrine is similarly peripheralized as representing legal and institutional detail, or "ideas," irrelevant to social theory. We think social theory should be concerned about these elisions. Modern social par- ticipants wear masks, too, now carrying the devolved authority of a high god. The mod- ern mask is actorhood itself, and in wearing it modern participants acquire their agentic professions reductively and exclusively as successful conspiracies. This vision reflects fealty to the dominant analytic realism, but it seems highly limited in substance. 12The sociological literature on stratification, much of it doggedly attached to nineteenth-century ideology, earnestly debates whether modern social status derives from the realities of public and collective ("political") actor-resources or private and organizational/individual ("economic") ones. This entire academic discourse has proceeded in scholastic disconnection from the evidence. It is odd-and indicative of social science's rigid resistance to phenomenological challenges-that those researching stratification (an identity constructed via the principle of individual equality) and those researching economic organization (an identity constructed via the principle of collective progress) have no convincing analysis of their own surprisingly elevated social status (let alone of their existence, an even bigger problem). Although these researchers are essentially functionless, and serve no clear actor, they insist on theories of status that feature function and actorhood: a conspicuous example of nonreflexive social science. 116</page><page sequence="18">CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION authority for themselves, each other, and the moral (and natural) universe (Berger, Berger, and Kellner 1973). They become agents for themselves, true, but under the condition that they are also agents for and under constructed rationalized and universalistic stan- dards. These ideas help explain the distinctive features of the modern actor, we have suggested: its historical and anthropological peculiarity, standardization and professional- ization, high structuration, isomorphism within and across types of actors, and extraor- dinary decoupling. Every one of these features is problematic in conventional realist theorizing-and in the more humanist cultural and interpretive work that has arisen in partial reaction. The notion of culturally devolved agency also helps explain distinctive features of the modern system of actors. Generations of realist theories, starting from a narrow concep- tion of the actor, have struggled to explain how collective action is possible. They have better conceptions of the blockages to collective action (and of the dynamics of raw actor interests) than of the contextual cultural forces that enable and facilitate it. The one-sided analytic preoccupation has been odd, given the demonstrated capacities and practices of the moderns in building imagined communities on expansive national and world scales- operating as others to each other and as agents for all sorts of nonactor interests, including the core high principles on which they all depend. Analysis of this matter is greatly fur- thered if one starts with the matrix of Western culture, and the idea that actorhood in the first place involves agentic authority devolved from a very distant and very high god. Legitimate actorhood has expanded continuously in this cultural system, and as part of its construction so has the capacity for expanded collective action. The dominant realist imag- ery has also erected a very peculiar "problem of social order" by seeing modern society as featuring a structure/agency tension between great raw social structural actors (principally the state) and raw subunit actors (especially individuals). This theorized tension is decen- tered (and downsized) if one sees actor agency as itself a central structure of the system: much of modern structuration exists in the formation, standardization, enactment, and celebration of agentic actorhood. It is further reconceptualized if one recognizes that cen- tral structures in the modern stratification system-its most distinctive feature a panoply of authoritative sciences and professions-build around relatively pure agency for high and universalistic collective principles. Contemporary theorists constantly enjoin us to theorize modern society by "bringing actors back in." This injunction has coincided with little actual analysis of actorhood. To develop such analysis, we have argued, one must necessarily see modern individuals. organizations, and states as taking up standardized technologies of agentic authority, devolved from an elaborate Christian then post-Christian culture.
