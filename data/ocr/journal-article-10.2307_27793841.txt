In this article the entanglement of psychology of religion and phenomenology of religion is explored starting with the writings of Gerardus van der Leeuw, his interest in a psychological method in phenomenology and his reception of L?vy-Bruhl's con cept of mystic participation. It is argued that psychology of religion in the Nether lands after the Second World War emerged out of the critique by Fokke Sierksma of the phenomenological method in the context of emancipating the science of religion (godsdienstwetenschap) from theology, and the reaction this provoked in the work of Han Fortmann, who defended L?vy-Bruhl and Van der Leeuw in order to "save" reli giosity in a modern secularized world. This theological objective further colored developments in psychology of religion, notably the current discussion on "giving ultimate meaning" (zingeving). In the light of an expected closer cooperation between psychology of religion and religious studies, a critical reflection on the often unre flected theological positions and objectives in discussions on "giving ultimate mean ing" is pleaded for.

Westerink / Numen 57 (2010) 186-211 187 Introduction In recent studies on the emergence of psychology of religion in the Netherlands the importance of Gerardus van der Leeuw's phenome nology of religion has been rediscovered (Vandermeersch &amp; Westerink 2007:230-240; Van Beizen 2007:146-150; Westerink 2009:ch. 3). In fact it can be stated that psychology of religion in the Netherlands is firmly rooted in a phenomenological tradition. This has not always been recognized. In general we can say that psychology of religion developed into a discipline closely associated with practical theology or mental care, and thus that psychologists of religion focused their attention on issues such as healthy vs. unhealthy religion or ? cur rently a dominant issue ? "giving ultimate meaning" (zingeving). The interaction with religious studies was somewhat neglected in this respect, despite a shared history and the fact that psychology of reli gion is always dependent on religious studies for its definition of reli gion. From the perspective of religious studies Van der Leeuw's interest in psychology has not always been judged on its merits. It has been argued that Van der Leeuw showed little interest in the humanities and in fact contributed to a degree of stagnation in the further develop ment of phenomenology of religion and science of religion (godsdienst wetenschap). Even stronger, his phenomenological approach was supposedly the finishing point of an intellectual movement that even tually proved to be a dead end (Hak 1994). In this article I will argue that Van der Leeuw's phenomenology and his interest in psychology was certainly not a dead end, but in fact the starting point of the emer gence of psychology of religion in the Netherlands after the Second World War. Though the influence of scholars like Ludwig Binswanger, Karl Jaspers, Eduard Spranger and especially Lucien L?vy-Bruhl has been noticed (Hofstee 1997:186ff., 207-237), his phenomenological method of empathie understanding and his objective of a "broadening of the ego" in order to ultimately understand coherence or totality of meaning, in relation to the emergence of psychology of religion in the Netherlands, has hardly been elaborated upon. In this article I will give a concise outline of Van der Leeuw's "psy chology" focusing on the influence of L?vy-Bruhl. I will argue that Van der Leeuw's reading of L?vy-Bruhl is not only indispensable for understanding his phenomenology of religion, but more importantly,</page><page sequence="3">188 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 I will show that L?vy-Bruhl's concepts of primitive mentality and mys tic participation through the writings of Van der Leeuw had a lasting effect on the emergence of and further developments in psychology of religion in the Netherlands. It is my hypothesis that in the current debate on "giving ultimate meaning" (zingeving) the underlying con ception of religion is still basically inspired by L?vy-Bruhl and Van der Leeuw, although this is often not recognized or made explicit. The dominant theories that regard zingeving as a general human function that is seemingly neutral towards religion or faith implicitly hold a specific definition of religion. Van der Leeuw, Psychology and L?vy-Bruhl When and exactly how Van der Leeuws interest in psychology first developed is hard to determine, but it must have been early in his career. In his oration at the start of his professorship in the history of religions at the theological faculty in Groningen he stated that all reli gions "originate from the same functioning of the human mind" and that they can be studied as "a psychological unity" (Van der Leeuw 1918:5). It would be the task of the phenomenologist to understand this unity by means of a compatible method. Although at first sight Van der Leeuw s phenomenology seems to be an application of Eduard Husserl's phenomenological method on religion, it has been convinc ingly argued that the influence of Husserl was limited (James 1995; Molendijk 2005:4lff.). In fact, Van der Leeuws phenomenology stands in a Dutch tradition of phenomenological approaches in the study of the history of religion. The founders of this phenomenologi cal tradition were P. D. Chantepie de la Saussaye and C. P. Tiele. De la Saussaye's successor, and the teacher of Van der Leeuw at the Univer sity of Leiden, was William Brede Kristensen. Kristensen, who never wrote a major systematic or methodological study in history of reli gions or phenomenology, was deeply influenced by Friedrich Schleier macher to whom he regularly refers. According to Kristensen, a phenomenologist should not just classify objects, but should have a feeling and intuition for religion in order to have a deeper understand ing of religious phenomena. Behind this notion lies the idea that real ity (or the universe) is a meaningful coherent unity that can be</page><page sequence="4">H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 189 understood in its totality (Kristensen 1960:1-23, 254-255). Here we find a possible source for Van der Leeuw's interest in psychology. Another source would be the work of the psychiatrist H. C. R?mke, who was a close friend of his since their Gymnasium days, and who would write a dissertation on the phenomenology of the feeling of happiness. He argues that feelings of happiness can transform into reli gious feelings, which he calls the "highest feelings" as they are related to the experience of being united with the divine. Here feelings of happiness find their ultimate culmination point (R?mke 1923). In a later study on character and unbelief he would argue that unbelief was a developmental disorder (R?mke 1939:7ff.)- Normal for homo religio sus would be a development of trust in life in which religion plays a natural role: religion was essentially "being a meaningful part of totality," a totality that serves as "ultimate ground" and as a direction in life. It is highly probable that Van der Leeuw's interest in the psycholo gies of Ludwig Binswanger and Karl Jaspers was triggered by R?mke (Molendijk 2005:43). Van der Leeuw corresponded with Binswanger from the early 1920s on. They met at the Vlllth International Con gress of Psychology held at Groningen in 1926, where Van der Leeuw ? who was at first uninvited, but nevertheless present because he wanted to meet L?vy-Bruhl (who eventually couldn't come to the conference) ? heard both Binswangens and Eduard Spranger's lec tures on the hermeneutical method in phenomenology and psychology in the writings of Wilhelm Dilthey and Jaspers. Here we find a con nection between Kristensen's view on phenomenology and a herme neutic tradition that starts with Schleiermacher, was deepened by Dilthey and then further developed by Jaspers, Binswanger and Spranger. Dilthey had tried to make a clear distinction between scien tific methods in the natural sciences and the hermeneutical method in the human sciences. Whereas in the natural sciences objects could only be studied in their physical appearance, in the human sciences the "liv ing" object could be experienced, expressed and understood in its coherence with other objects.1 The presupposition was that the human !) "Die Geisteswissenschaften beruhen auf dem Verh?ltnis von Erlebnis, Ausdruck und Verstehen" (Dilthey 1927:131).</page><page sequence="5">190 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 psyche is composed of and structured by permanent capacities such as observing, thinking, wanting and feeling. All people share the same psychic structure (Dilthey 1927:15ff.). This was the sine qua non for the subject to be able to understand its object, despite cultural and personal differences.2 The object could be understood in its manifesta tions, as far as it expressed itself, because a subject could project him self in the object as it appears, and experience what the other experienced (Nacherleben) in a reconstruction of the intentions in the expression. Dilthey's structural psychology was further developed. In his phenomenological approaches Jaspers had argued that psychology should be a psychology of understanding, and he had used the concept empathie understanding (einf?hlend Verstehen) to indicate the method for understanding an object in its coherence (Jaspers 1959[1913]:253). Binswanger, a colleague of Carl Gustav Jung at the Kreuzlingen sana torium, notably in his earlier writings tried to develop a phenomeno logical psychology in the line of Dilthey in which also (elements of) psychoanalysis could be taken up (Binswanger 1922:268). At impor tant moments in Van der Leeuw's writings, when he elaborates on the psychological method in phenomenology, the writings of Jaspers and Binswanger are referred to.3 Their interpretation of Dilthey's herme neutics as a method of empathie understanding is a main reason why Van der Leeuw calls his method not only Nacherleben but also Einf?h lung (Van der Leeuw 1926:1?43).4 At this point, his concept of under standing differs from Spranger's, who is also an important source for Van der Leeuw. Spranger had argued that understanding was an objec tive understanding of meaningful psychic coherence. This objectivity was possible, because the psychologist could compare individual expe riences with his knowledge of general psychic structures (Spranger 1950[1921]:4l0ff.). Despite the fact that Sprangers ideas on cluster 2) "Jede einzelne Lebens?u?erung repr?sentiert [...] ein Gemeinsames. Jedes Wort, jeder Satz [...] sind nur verst?ndlich, weil eine Gemeinsamkeit den sich in ihnen ?u?ernden mit dem Verstehenden verbindet; der einzelne erlebt, denkt und handelt stets in einer Sph?re von Gemeinsamkeit, und nur in einer solchen versteht er." Dilthey, Wilhelm, "Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissen schaften" (Dilthey 1927:146-147). 3) For example in Van der Leeuw 1933:634ff. 4) Here Van der Leeuw elaborates on empathie understanding, mainly referring to Binswanger's Einf?hrung in die Probleme der allgemeinen Psychologie.</page><page sequence="6">H. Westerink / Numen 57 (2010) 186-211 191 ing phenomena in ideal types are an important element in Van der Leeuws phenomenology, the possibility of an objective "outside" posi tion of the phenomenologist is denied.5 The success of the method is bound to the personal qualities of the phenomenologist. Hence, the psychological/phenomenological method is in constant further devel opment growing into a deeper understanding of both object and sub ject. The latter Van der Leeuw calls "the broadening of the ego" (Van der Leeuw 1926:25?26). This is in itself an aim in phenomenology: the more a subject understands himself or herself, the more the art of understanding can be further developed, which means that in the end even the most difficult phenomena to grasp (for example those in the most "primitive" societies or those related to madness) can be under stood. Is there a limit to this empathie understanding? Van der Leeuw speaks of an epoche, or final limit, to indicate that the phenomenolo gist experiences and understands structures of meaning, coherences of meaning, but does not have the pretense to have an ultimate under standing (or judgment) of the reality or the truth.6 That is beyond his competence; that is an issue for "theoretical and eschatological theol ogy." However sharp this distinction might seem, the broadening of the ego does not only bring about a better understanding of phenom ena; it also opens up a subject for a revelation of truth. Beyond the understandable (for the phenomenologist) there is a last "totality of meaning" in which all human understanding is taken up in a being understood by God.7 In this sense, the epoche not only functions as an ultimate limit of phenomenological understanding, but also as the point where phenomenology is taken up in theology.8 5) See for example Van der Leeuw 1941:11-24. 6) "Die 'letzte Grenze' ist nicht blo? in dem von Jaspers gemeinten Sinne nie erreich bar. Sie bedeutet auch die Unerreichbarkeit des Daseins. Die Ph?nomenologie ist weder Metaphysik noch Erfassung der empirischen Wirklichkeit. Sie beachtet die Zur?ckhaltung, die Epoche, und ihr Verst?ndnis des Geschehens ist abh?ngig von seiner 'Einklammerung.' Die Ph?nomenologie K?mmert sich nur um Ph?nomene, d.h. um das Sich Zeigende; es gibt f?r sie kein 'Dahinter' des Ph?nomens" (Van der Leeuw 1933:640). 7) In this theological position and conviction we find the deepest source of Van der Leeuw's notion of primitive mentality; see Leertouwer 1991:204. 8) In an article Van der Leeuw divides theology into three disciplines, 1. historical theology (biblical sciences, church history and the history of other religions) which</page><page sequence="7">192 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 Van der Leeuw's psychological method depended on the premise of a psychic unity, an empathie understanding due to underlying general human psychic structures and ultimately a coherence and totality of meaning. It is in L?vy-Bruhl's studies on primitive mentality and mys tic participation that Van der Leeuw found a suitable theoretical framework; understanding this dependence on L?vy-Bruhl is of a cru cial importance if we wish to comprehend Van der Leeuw's ideas on phenomenology of religion and theology (Hofstee 1997). L?vy-Bruhl was a French sociologist who, influenced by Herbert Spencer and Emile D?rkheim, focused in his work on the general human mental structures that could be found underlying different cultures. In Les fonctions mentales dans les soci?t?s inf?rieures (1910), and later in for example La mentalit? primitive (1922), he presented a theory on the difference between collective representations in primitive and advanced (modern) cultures. The "primitives" did not differentiate between affective, intuitive and cognitive processes and hence their representa tions and their perceptions and experiences of the world were quite dif ferent from those of modern people. He called this "primitive mentality" pr?logique or mystique. Primitive thinking was pre-logical, which meant that in primitive mentality contradictions ? for example the conviction that one soul can be in two different places at the same time ? were not excluded (L?vy-Bruhl 1922 [1910]:79);9 and mysti cal, a concept that should not be taken in a strictly religious sense, but indicated the faith in forces and influences that are invisible and yet perceived to be as real as visible objects (L?vy-Bruhl 1922 [1910]:30; 1947 [1922]: 14). This primitive mentality was dependent on and mainly uses a comprehensive-explaining methodology, 2. science of religion (phe nomenology of religion) which aims at understanding the material found in historical theology, and 3. theoretical or eschatological theology (dogmatics and ethics) "welche die Grenzen sowohl des Erfa?baren wie des Verstehbaren ?bersteigt und einen letzten Sinnzusammenhang anzudeuten versucht, in dem alles menschliche Verstehen schlie?lich auf ein Verstandenwerden durch Gott zur?ckgef?hrt wird" (Van der Leeuw 1928a:326). Compare: "Es bleibt also ein Rest, der grunds?tzlich nicht ver standen werden kann, der aber von der Religion als die Bedingung alles Verstehens angesehen wird. Das Verstehen wird an der Grenze der Erscheinungswelt von einem Verstanden-Werden abgel?st" (Van der Leeuw 1933:440). 9) Compare: "pr?logique, c'est-?-dire indiff?rente le plus souvent ? la contradiction" (L?vy-Bruhl 1947 [1922]:85).</page><page sequence="8">H. Westerink / Numen 57 (2010) 186-211 193 characterized by a feeling of unity or "continuum" (L?vy-Bruhl 1922 [1910]: 109) with the cosmos, a feeling which he designated with the concept of mystic participation. The main characteristic of primitive mentality is thus: "tous impliquent une participation entre les ?tres ou les objets li?s dans une repr?sentation collective." This is called "la loi de participation, le principe propre de la mentalit? primitive'" (L?vy Bruhl 1922 [1910]:76; cf. also L?vy-Bruhl 1947 [1922]:17-18). The "primitives" thus had their own systematic conception of the world, but without the logic of modern rational thought. L?vy-Bruhl's theory was a welcome alternative to the dominant the ories, which were evolutionist (Tylor, Frazer) and sought the essence of religion in its origin and historic development. Van der Leeuw devoted several writings to L?vy-Bruhl's theory.10 They knew each other per sonally and stayed in contact throughout the years. The theory of primitive mentality was crucial for Van der Leeuw, because it provided a framework for his ideas on religion, psychological unity and the method of empathie understanding. This is reflected in a definition of religion formulated by Van der Leeuw: religion is "the unity of subject and object, God and human being, the primal identity, that is so often desired for as ultimate identity; the background of all religion is mysticism".11 In Van der Leeuw's interpretation primitive mentality is ? more explicitly than in L?vy-Bruhl's writings ? a general anthro pological structure for "primitives" as well as for modern people. This slight reconfiguration of the theory of primitive mentality had impor tant consequences. Van der Leeuw argued that especially in religion primitive mentality is still strongly present and here he finds a point to criticize modern secularized society. Modern people have unfortu nately lost contact with their primitive nature (as homo religiosus) through the modern subject-object dichotomy (Hofstee 1997:233 234). Here we can see (again) how phenomenology transforms into theology. ,0) Notably Van der Leeuw 1928b and 1937; see also Kippenberg 1997:255-258. n) "De achtergrond van alle religie is de eenheid van subject en object, van God en mens, de oer-identiteit, die tevens vaak als eind-identiteit wordt verlangd. De achter grond van alle religie is mystiek" (Van der Leeuw 1937:171). Leertouwer has written: "The deepest source of Van der Leeuw's notion of primitivity' is, as far as I can see, to be found in theology" (1991:204).</page><page sequence="9">194 H. Westerink I Numen 57 (2010) 186-211 To conclude, the key issues in Van der Leeuw's phenomenology of religion are primitive mentality (as a general mental structure in both "primitive" and modern people); the psychological method of empathie understanding and "broadening of the ego" with the perspective of understanding coherence and totality of meaning; the theological objective of penetrating into the essence of religion in order to over come the modern subject-object dichotomy. Sierksma, Science of Religion and Projection Fokke Sierksma (1917-1977) was one of the most talented of Van der Leeuw's students. In his student years he initially followed in Van der Leeuw's footsteps. It is known that he wrote a thesis on primitive men tality in 1938 (Van Iersel 1991:233), but already in his dissertation, published in 1951 as Freud, Jung en de religie [Freud, Jung and reli gion], Sierksma distanced himself from Van der Leeuw's phenomeno logical method and his reception of L?vy-Bruhl's thought on mystic participation, and instead turned to Jungian depth psychology. What was the core of his critique of Van der Leeuw, and why a turn to depth psychology? Sierksma writes in his dissertation that the basic problem with Van der Leeuw's oeuvre is "the problem of the relation between faith and science." In his phenomenology "the old ghost of the religio naturalis and hence also of theologia naturalis has not yet been exorcized" (Sierksma 1951:196-197). What Sierksma is referring to here is the hermeneutical method that was first developed by Schleiermacher and that was then further elaborated upon by Dilthey, Jaspers, Spranger and Binswanger: the idea that religion can only be understood from within religion (ibid.: 13). The phenomenological method of under standing "accepts the risk of subjectivity to 100%". It does not aim at an objective "Schau" of phenomena, but at an understanding through empathie inner contact. This means that the phenomenologist must participate in the religious phenomena. In the aforementioned defini tion of religion presented by Van der Leeuw it is clear that this partici pation is ultimately not "scientific," as Sierksma calls it, but "existential" (ibid.: 16-17). The fact that Van der Leeuw's phenomenol ogy transgresses into theology is the problem here. The phenomeno</page><page sequence="10">H. Westerink / Numen 57(2010) 186-211 195 logical method of understanding through empathie participation and the adagium that religion must be understood through religion implies that science of religion will never emancipate itself from theology. And yet, this is what Sierksma not only regards as a clear historical develop ment since the Enlightenment, but also as a desired objective: science of religion should further emancipate itself from theology. Van der Leeuws phenomenology has thus to be further developed into a sci ence of religion that "resists" theology and that is no longer deter mined by the old theological "conflict between natural and revealed religion" (ibid.:20). Sierksma sees this as an inevitable development, as part of a cultural process in which God as centre of the universe is replaced by the human being. The historical development of secularization and the replacement of God by the human being, in itself gives a clear indication for a turn to depth psychology. An emancipated science of religion should not have to fall back on a doctrine on God, but on a doctrine on the human being (ibid.: 15), i.e. a psychological theory that can serve as a unifying new foundation for a method of understanding. According to Sierksma, the emergence of psychology shows a similar development as the emergence of a science of religion. It is a history of emancipa tion, in this case emancipation from philosophy. More importantly, psychology has eventually developed a method that can easily be com pared with phenomenology. After a period of psychological reduction ism (e.g. in Freudian psychoanalysis) and formalistic experimental methods (e.g. in the work of Karl Girgensohn), Jung had developed a phenomenological approach that tried to describe, order and under stand phenomena such as religion without value judgment or confron tation with some sort of theological truth (ibid..T9). Whether this assessment is correct can be doubted, and indeed, Sierksma would soon distance himself from Jung, because of the fact that his doctrine on the collective unconscious and the archetypes is in fact a religious truth, a religious conviction. Ultimately Jung's depth psychology will not be an alternative to theology, and it will thus not serve the eman cipation of science of religion. Nevertheless, in his dissertation Jung is understood as compatible with phenomenology and offering a "solu tion" to the problem of its dependence on theology. There was more to this turn to depth psychology than finding an alternative foundation for a method of understanding. Hak is right</page><page sequence="11">196 H. Westerink i Numen 57(2010) 186-211 when he states that the real issue was the question how understanding and explaining were related (Hak 1994:89). Jungs depth psychology opened the way for redefining the relation between understanding and explaining. Concerning this matter, Sierksma devoted a large part of his dissertation to a critique of Jasper's sharp division between a method of understanding and a method of explanation, as well as Spranger's elaborations on that matter (Sierksma 1951:35-89). Jungs theory of the collective unconscious and the archetypes are the irre ducible "facts" on which a method of understanding can be built with out reducing phenomena to drives (as Freud did). In this way the psychological method of understanding can be made comprehensible within the limits of psychology itself. This method was no longer an intuitive empathie method. Following Jung's "phenomenology" meant that Verstehen could be defined as "making conscious" unconscious phenomena. Tliis understanding of phenomena in fact included causal explanation. What Sierksma had called "the fundamental unity of understanding and explaining" in his critique of Jaspers (ibid.:59), could be found in Jung's phenomenological depth psychology (ibid.:l40ff.). Depth psychology's facts and causal explanations thus seemed to provide the phenomenological method with a certain objec tivity that was lacking in Van der Leeuw's methodology. Jung's theory of the collective unconscious and the archetypes, i.e. his ideas on primitivity, also provide an alternative to L?vy-Bruhl's concept of primitive mentality in Van der Leeuw's phenomenology. Primitive mentality is no longer a state of mind that can only be made comprehensible by means of an intuitive empathie method, but can now be envisioned as an objective autonomous psychic structure. The integrative finality of Jungian psychology in what he called the Self can still be described as mystic participation, but instead of returning to L?vy-Bruhl Sierksma was moving in another direction. Sierksma's movement away from Van der Leeuw was accelerated by the so-called projection debate that started after the publication of Simon Vestdijk's essay De toekomst der religie [The future of religion] in 1948 (Vestdijk 1975 [1948]). This essay presented a typology of religi osity that was more than just descriptive. Basically it was a firm cri tique of what he called the "metaphysical type," in which one could easily recognize a Calvinist believer. Vestdijk argued that this type</page><page sequence="12">H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 197 should be overcome in a future religion without God that would be a kind of synthesis of Socialism and Buddhism. A key concept in this essay was "projection." Religion is characterized by the pursuit of "the natural complete human being or natural complete humanity" as ideal.12 The "metaphysical type" projects this ideal on the transcendent, i.e. he transforms subjective intra-psychic elements into an objectively experienced reality. In this general definition Vestdijk first of all refers to Kant and his reflections on human cognition and subjective percep tion. Images of reality are created because of certain "emotions, needs and drives, dislike and inclination, dream and reflection, anxiousness and self-interest" (ibid.:66). There are also Jungian elements in Ves ti de's concept, notably in the idea of projection as a mechanism involved in the pursuit of totality (ibid.: 159). Vestdijk was immediately sharply criticized, amongst others by Van der Leeuw. It was Sierksma who stood up to defend him (Sierksma 1952). He had a clear opinion about the general reaction to Vestdijk: "his scientific hypothesis fell in the hands of persons who did not study religion, but wanted to defend Christianity" (Sierksma 1977 [1956]: 162). At this point, the debate on the essay converged with his own attempts to emancipate science of religion. But Vestdijk's essay was important for a more fundamental reason: he had touched upon a problem in Van der Leeuw's phenomenology: the psychological motives that underlie a type of religiosity or religion. It could be read as a deconstruction of Van der Leeuw's ideas on broadening of the ego and growing understanding of the "world." What was in fact the dif ference between an intuitive phenomenological method of empathie participation and the psychological mechanism of projection? How could phenomenological self-expression be distinguished from what seems to be its negative, the projection of subjective intra-psychic ele ments into an experienced phenomenon? The projection mechanism and the phenomenological method of empathie understanding were situated in the same affective entanglement of subject and object. Had not Van der Leeuw himself made this problem explicit when he argued 12) Vestdijk 1975 [1948]:29?30. Vestdijk defines religion as a desire for and pursuit of unity, totality or "Totalsinn," referring to the phenomenological tradition. Cf. ibid.rl 1?12.</page><page sequence="13">198 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 that there was no "outside" position from which the world or the "self" could be understood?13 Understanding phenomena was eventually the same as understanding the subjects own structuring of reality. Sierksmas involvement in the projection debate culminated in the publication of De religieuzeprojectie [The religious projection] in 1956, an intellectual masterpiece that can be regarded as the most important publication in Dutch psychology of religion in the 1950s (Van Beizen 2007:184?193). In this study Jungian psychology is no longer the dominant theory. The starting point is Helmut Plessner s Die Stufen des Organischen und der Mensch [The Gradation of the Organic and the Human Being] published in 1928. Sierksma argues that projection is always the subjective component in perception activity.14 To under stand the typical human features of subjectivity in perception Sierksma takes up Plessner's distinctions between the centricity of animals in their natural environment and human eccentricity (Plessner 1975 [1928]:309ff.). Like animals, humans, as far as they "are" a body with senses and instincts, live "centrically" in their environment, being able to create a world in which they can easily orientate themselves.15 But unique for humans is their ability to objectify the world, to take a dis tance from the world they live in, and create an image of the world, i.e. to make a distinction between subject and object (Sierksma 1977 [1956]:21-22). In this sense human beings live "eccentrically"; they can experience themselves as being in the centre from an "objective" position. Being both centric and eccentric implies that the human being "knows that the world is actually different from how it is per 13) In a 1941 anthropological study Van der Leeuw's starting point ? referring to Plessner amongst others ? are reflections on the relation between man and world addressing the problem that understanding the world (as object) is actually nothing else but understanding the structures humans have imposed on the world in order to understand it. That means that human beings only understands themselves, i.e. their thought constructions and perceptions of the world. In other words, they understand the echo' ? one might say, projection ? of themselves (Van der Leeuw 1941:11-24). 14) Sierksma 1977 [1956]:64. "De eenheid in de verscheidenheid der projectie-ver schijnselen is het feit, dat de mens weet, dat zijn eigen waarnemingen zo goed als die van andere levende wezens een wereld scheppen, die niet samenvalt met de wereld los-van-die-waarnemingen" (ibid.:7). 15) Sierksma 1977 [1956]:20. Apparently Sierksma had a profound interest in animal psychology and spent a lot of time in the Zoological Laboratory in Leiden observing the behaviour of sticklebacks. Cf.

The human being knows that he is projecting ? he is homo proiiciens ? and he knows he has to deproject in order to know the world as it really is (ibid.:25?26). What is this projection? According to Sierksma, the centricity and eccentricity of human beings can be described in terms of psychic con flict. Essential in psychic life is not a mystic participation in totality or a harmonious development of the individual, but the conflict between self-consciousness and the autonomous unconscious with its own laws and mechanisms (drives) on an organic basis (body). "The human being is an animal thrown out of balance"; he has lost centricity and the accuracy of animal instincts is not to be found in humans. The drives are excessive and spontaneously trigger feelings of helplessness that can only be overcome as far as the human being is able to control his inner life and the outside world from an eccentric position ? culture is nothing but a system of defense against nature (ibid.:70fi\). Psychological conflict and helplessness are thus the driving forces in ones ongoing attempts to find an (unstable) balance both in the inner life and in the outside world. Projection is the mechanism that secures humans from being overwhelmed by the drives and thus supports psy chological balance by creating an image of the world. Religious projec tion is then seen by Sierksma as a form of common projection (ibid.: 156). An inner "something" that threatens psychological balance is projected onto the outside world as a mysterious "something" ? Sierksma thus defines religion as the awareness that "there is some thing" (ibid.: 135). With this definition Sierksma avoids Van der Leeuws theology. The eccentric position of the human being contra dicts any attempt to view religion as a totality in which the subject participates; there is always some hidden aspect beyond the borders of any world view. The key issue is no longer the relation between primitive mentality and modern mentality, but non-projection (in earliest childhood), projection and deprojection.16 The theory of eccentricity and projection is a further step in an intellectual development away from L?vy-Bruhl's 16) This is exactly what Sierksma aims at and admired in Vestdijk: a theory of religion, not based on or culminating in a Christian perspective, but a theory of religion based on a mechanism that could be found in all religions, even that religion which, because of its supposed atheistic nature, had always posed a problem in the study of religions, Buddhism (ibid.:175).</page><page sequence="15">200 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 concept of mystical participation, Van der Leeuw's phenomenological method of empathie understanding, theology in general, and also Jung s ideas on archetypes. Next to Plessner, and probably under influ ence of the critique of Vestdijk associating his "reductionism" with Freud's studies in applied psychoanalysis, Freudian anthropology with its emphasis on inner conflicts, the human being's helplessness and desperate attempts to gain control over an unstable environment, is positively valued (ibid.:59). In this context religion is not only a cul tural system providing stability and unity, but also has an "uncanny" trait: revelation is a disruptive experience that only confirms the insta bility of the environment (ibid.xh. 4). Because of the inevitable sepa ration of subject and object Sierksma finishes his book with a plea for deprojection as it is found in Buddhism, a religion that like a science is "the last step out of humanity's childhood, out of a world where mind-created figures populated a metaphysical heaven and hell."17 The notion of eccentricity and the need for control over the natural envi ronment make it possible to both understand and explain a wished-for participation in totality. Sierksma's plea for deprojection is then a radi cal acceptance of the subject-object dichotomy, of the eccentricity and lack of inner coherence (or totality) of the human being. Psychological conflict and helplessness cause projection. Religious projection provides psychological balance. Religion's primal function is to provide stability and security. Deprojection as found in science (of religion) and Buddhism is necessary in order to understand religion and accept the eccentricity of the human being. The task of the scholar in science of religion is to understand religious phenomena in the light of their function: the balance a certain culture seeks for individuals and groups (Van Iersel 1991:85). In Sierksma's later writings in the field of science of religion this is the starting point. In The Gods as we 17) Ibid.: 175-177. We should notice here that Jung held similar ideas on deprojec tion. In the context of discussing Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism in Psychologie und Religion Jung argues that in individual development towards becoming "Self" (as the sum of conscious and unconscious phenomena) the illusion ary anthropomorphic projections of gods and demons should be "taken back." This deprojection would bring back the projected elements of the soul to their psychic ori gin. Cf. Jung 1963:90-93.</page><page sequence="16">H. Westerink I Numen 57 (2010) 186-211 201 shape them (I960) Sierksmas views on (ec)centricity and religious pro jection are clearly reflected when he writes: "Both animals and man need fixed points by which they can orient themselves and 'know where they are'. Man too needs security, something to hold on to" (Sierksma 1960:28). The inner world of the drives is projected onto the outside world and in religious representations and the images of gods (as part of culture) one can always recognize man's projections and inner conflicts in the gods that man both desires and fears to be, says Sierksma. "The fundamental feature of the psychic structure is the duality of man." On the one hand he is corporeal "in a situation that gives pleasure and satisfaction." "On the other hand he can stand detached from himself" and "consider himself objectively and analyti cally." Through projection this centricity and eccentricity is also char acteristic of the gods ? on the one hand they are part of the world (centric), on the other hand they are purely spiritual beings beyond the world (eccentric). The tension between these two poles is nowhere more in evidence than in Buddhism, trusting completely in the human mind and thus arriving at "absolute objectivity and absolute analysis" (ibid.:40). In his major 1966 study Tibet's Terrifying Deities the key ideas on religious projection and Sierksmas fascination for Buddhism are cen tral elements. Humans are always in conflict and religious projection, which serves to provide security and stability, will eventually fail its objective ? ultimately human beings have to reconcile themselves with the fact that they are eccentric and only thus they can "conquer the false reality" of the drives, fears and conflicts projected in the out side world (ibid.:42). In Tibetan Buddhism this deprojection is accom plished. The ancient Tibetan terrifying deities are acknowledged in later Buddhism as existing, yet unreal. The old deities are regarded to be the projection of the "dreadful sensory world, of nature, the body, sensuality and self-destroying lust" i.e. "the projection of that human deficiency caused by the relative tension between the ego and the eccentric centre" (Sierksma 1966:143, 158). What fascinates Sierksma in Tibet's acculturation processes is the shift from an old religion, in which human aggressiveness is projected onto the outside world and takes the shape of terrifying deities, to applying sublimated aggressiv ity in order to destroy the illusionary gods as well as the illusionary</page><page sequence="17">202 H. Westerink I Numen 57 (2010) 186-211 ego. Thus Buddhism is characterized by the movement towards eccentricity in which a purely analytical perspective is realized.18 Though Sierksmas book on religious projection is largely unknown outside the Netherlands, this text is of vital importance for under standing Sierksmas analysis of Tibet s religious history. In the process of emancipating science of religion, in his urge to integrate scientific explanation in a phenomenology solely dominated by subjective understanding and self expression and through his involvement in the projection debate, Sierksma turned to depth psy chology/psychoanalysis and philosophical anthropology. Rethinking the phenomenological method was thus the beginning of the emer gence of psychology of religion in the Netherlands after the Second World War. From the late 1950s on Sierksma himself focused on com parative religion and modern cultural anthropology. Outside the Neth erlands he is thus primarily known as a cultural anthropologist. Psychoanalysis always remained a point of reference in his work and at the University of Leiden he would always consider psychology of reli gion his discipline (Van Beizen 2007:193). Yet, Sierksma was an iso lated scholar, engaged in many conflicts with colleagues and having few students. His projects, rooted in the entanglement of phenome nology and psychology of religion, were not further elaborated upon by others. Fortmann, Psychology of Religion and Participation "We will have to consider theoretical atheism ? Marx and Freud ? as the effect of a structure of consciousness and hence ask ourselves why atheism cannot but regard God as a fiction, a creation by humans out of need, in short as a projection. The projection theory is the out come of a change in our structure of consciousness, which one can provisionally indicate as the separation of subject and object." "The subject of this study is the projection theory as manifestation of our one-sided scientific culture" (Fortmann 1981 [1964]:I, 28-29). These are sentences from the introductory chapter of Han Fortmann's 1966 18) Especially in the chapter on shamanism and mysticism (Ch?d) this issue is elabo rated upon (Sierksma 1966:141-159).</page><page sequence="18">H. Westerink / Numen 57(2010) 186-211 203 1968 Als ziende de Onzienlijke [Envisioning the Invisible] in which he puts forward the main hypothesis of his study, namely that 'the' pro jection theory as manifestation of a specific scientific culture is not useful as a theory to understand religious perception. Fortmann (1912-1970) had been appointed professor of general and compara tive psychology of culture and religion at Nijmegen University in 1956. From his earliest writings on his main concern is the growing distance between the official Catholic Church doctrine and pastoral practice. In his view theology has a lot to gain from the human sci ences, from psychotherapy and psychology as auxiliary sciences, to re establish the relation between theology and practice. With this objective his work can be situated in a broad international develop ment in the fields of practical theology, pastoral psychology and psy chology of religion. Scholars such as Heye Faber (in the Netherlands) or Joachim Scharfenberg (in Germany) can be located in this context of turning to psychological theories as a critical and constructive potential for theology. Fortmanns main alternative to projection theories, and the most important subject of his study, is religious experience. Opposing the alleged reductionism of projection theorists such as Freud, Jung, Vest dijk and Sierksma, he puts forward his ideas on religious experience in the modern world. Religious experience originates where humans per ceive their world as contingent, incomprehensible, unknown and opaque. This does not evoke a religious experience of the transcendent as a "nature reserve for God" outside this world, but as an inner worldly transcendence (ibid.:312-313). Unfortunately, Fortmann sug gests, modern human beings have lost the ability to naturally intuit the spiritual in physical reality, and have become merely spectators of themselves and the world. This subject-object dichotomy is modern, and with it the perception of the world as either objective (rational sci entific) or subjective (the projection of needs, wishes, affects). The alternative is to be found in the existential experience of a deeper mys tery and ultimate meaning of life beyond the worldly contingencies. In religious experience one thus finds what the projection theorists neglected: "that seeing is a response to the fact that there is something to see" (ibid.:4ll), a formulation that echoes Van der Leeuw's depic tion of the phenomenon that can be understood as far as it shows itself.</page><page sequence="19">204 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 One of the issues that Fortmann addresses in his voluminous ? and hardly systematic19 ? study is the aim of projection. According to Fortmann, projection theorists consider the aim of the mechanism either as defense or as a way to restore unity or security. As to the latter aspect of the projection theory he notices that Jung had related this state of unity to L?vy-Bruhl's concept of mystic participation (ibid.:366). Hence, he gives an extensive introduction to L?vy-Bruhl and presents an outline of the main critical points that have been made against this theory of primitive mentality and mystic participation (mostly formulated by L?vy-Bruhl himself in his posthumously pub lished Carnets; ibid.:478?517). According to Fortmann, participation should not be interpreted as the effect of projection, but as the aware ness of coherences and relations between "things." The primitives were not yet isolated subjects that projected, but they had certain knowl edge of their world in which they lived and were integrated. Mystic participation should thus not be seen as an attempt to construct a sta ble environment out of a sense of helplessness or eccentricity. L?vy Bruhl and Van der Leeuw were actually right when they interpreted participation as the undividedness of subject and world. This is exactly what is lost in religion in the modern secularized world, but what could be rediscovered in religious experience. In line with Van der Leeuw, modern human beings are seen as having lost contact with their own primitive nature (as homo religiosus) through the modern subject-object dichotomy. When Fortmann evaluates the first volume of his study he writes: "our aim was to save perception, especially primitive, naive, spontane ous perception. I must admit, that I made this effort in order to save the faith of believers" (Fortmann 1981 [1964]:II, 31). We might add that Fortmann did more than just trying to save primitive perception. He also "saved" religious participation and even Van der Leeuw's phe nomenology.20 19) See Van Beizen 2007:223ff. 20) "De fenomenologische antropologie ontkent het uitgangspunt, dat door de pro jectiepsychologen wordt ingenomen: de scheiding tussen subject en wereld. Zij beschouwt met Binswanger die scheiding als 'Krebs?bel aller Psychologie'" (Fort mann 1981 [1964]:!, 381).</page><page sequence="20">H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 205 Van der Lans and "Giving Ultimate Meaning" The projection debate that started with Vestdijk's essay and ended twenty years later with Fortmann's magnum opus shows how the emergence of psychology of religion in the Netherlands was entangled with Van der Leeuw's phenomenology and reception of L?vy-Bruhl, and with Sierksmas attempts to emancipate science of religion from theology which provoked Fortmann's reaction defending participation (in a meaningful totality) and religious experience. Sierksmas difficult character and his many conflicts made him an isolated figure at Leiden University, a scholar who was only late in his career rewarded with a professorship, and without students who could continue his line of research. Fortmann on the other hand did have students who would pursue academic careers in psychology of religion and dominate future (and even present-day) debates in this field.21 The influence of Fortmann can certainly be found in the work of the psy chologist of religion Jan van der Lans (1933-2002). He "pursued the agenda" of Fortmann, i.e. the project of saving religion and religious experience by searching for a second primitivity in a modern secular ized world. Key concepts in his work are: "experience, myth, giving ultimate meaning, and again experience" (Janssen 2006). When elabo rating on the disappearance of the mythical-religious world view in modernity Van der Lans describes mythical thinking in terms of par ticipation, a world of unity without separation between nature and culture, subjective and objective reality.22 He explicitly refers to L?vy Bruhl and Van der Leeuw as scholars who reflected on "mythical con sciousness," a synonym for primitive mentality.23 Opposed to this 21 ) "Het godsdienstpsychologisch onderzoek dat sinds het aantreden van Han Fort mann op deze universiteit [Nijmegen] verricht is, heeft bij voortduring de grenzen van de kerkelijke instituties opgezocht. Het werk van Fortmann, Weima, Berger, Van der Lans en Van Uden, maar ook het onderzoek dat ik zelf met collega's heb verricht, wordt gekenmerkt door een zoeken naar religiositeit op onverwachte plaatsen. Een zoeken naar de verborgen psychologische kern, gedragen door Fortmanns roep om een herstel van de religieuze ervaring" (Janssen 2007:114). 22) In his essay "Geloven: een kwestie van fantasie. Een godsdienstpsychologische bij drage aan een hedendaagse verantwoording van het godsdienstige geloven" (Van der Lans 2006:52-71). 23) Ibid.:58. Compare also Van der Lans 1978:38ff.</page><page sequence="21">206 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 mythical consciousness is our modern rationalized world with its divi sions into domains: inner subjective reality, inter-subjective reality (collective norms, ideas and values) and the world of the physical objects. This "lost" mythical consciousness should be rediscovered as a religious ideal in everyday life and in the longing for the Deus abscon ditus. Participation is again seen as an alternative to a modern subject object dichotomy in a secularized society. In this context the concept of "giving ultimate meaning" (zingeving) became important in his work. Giving meaning is regarded as a gen eral human psychic function in which perceptions are processed and ordered in a world view. This is not only an everyday automatic pro cess, but, according to Van der Lans, human beings are also "disposi tioned to ask the ultimate meaning questions that can result in a religious experience."24 This religious experience is not the experience of a God that reveals himself, but must be regarded as a "core experi ence" in which "the true authentic self is qualified with a transcenden tal dimension."25 It is an experience of being related to a totality of existence, of being part of a totality of meaning. It is an inner-worldly experience of transcendence, of being elevated above the field of every day life. This process of giving ultimate meaning is thus related to the old issue of participation in a meaningful totality against the back ground of a modern secularized world. Interestingly, in this process of giving meaning fantasy and imagination play key roles. Though pro jection theory was sharply refuted by Fortmann, the rise of new psy chological theories in the 1970s (e.g. Kohut's and Erikson's self psychologies) meant that the function of "projection" could now be positively valued as the subject's constitutive capacities for an all embracing world view. "Faith," Van der Lans writes, "is an affective relationship with an object that can only be grasped in images." "Nobody has ever seen God. But when I detect the feeling in myself that there is someone who speaks to me, I cannot do anything else but form an image with the help of my imagination. For a modern anthro 24) See Van der Lans' essay "Zingeving en zingevingsfuncties van religie bij stress" (Van der Lans 2006:72-127); quote from p. 87. 25) See Van der Lans' essay "Kernervaring, esthetische emotie en religieuze betekenis geving" (Van der Lans 2006:128-163); quote from p. 140.</page><page sequence="22">H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 207 pology of faith this seems to me of extreme importance."26 Hence, the mechanism of projection reappears in the guise of imagination, fantasy and giving ultimate meaning, in the mental activity of making an image of an object one cannot know otherwise, and in the subjective meaning-giving structuring of the world. This process indicates the elevation of "whole man" above everyday life in order to participate in a totality of meaning.27 Van der Lans put the issue of giving ultimate meaning on the agenda of psychology of religion in the Netherlands.28 In an intellec tual line of thought from Van der Leeuw up to present discussions on zingeving the key issues are the natural inclinations of the human being towards giving ultimate meaning and to proceed in a process of "broadening of the ego" and growing in understanding coherence. It is a discourse on homo religiosus who through self-transcendence partici pates in a totality of meaning experienced in a modern secularized world. Evaluation: Giving Ultimate Meaning In current discussions in the field of psychology of religion and mental care in the Netherlands the issue of giving ultimate meaning has become the main issue.29 The discussions partly focus on worldly pas toral care, that is, mental care practiced by specialists in existential questions and problems concerning giving meaning to life without a direct relation with a religious institution or tradition. The idea here is that, as Van der Lans already indicated, giving ultimate meaning is a general everyday human psychological function. Existential questions and problems give rise to a more existentially conscious reflection on giving meaning. The worldly "pastor" could guide such a process in which the boundaries between giving meaning and faith become fluid. As Stroeken indicates, "meaning has something to do with being part 26) In Van der Lans, "Geloven: een kwestie van fantasie" (Van der Lans 2006:52-71); quote from p. 67. 27) Compare Zock 2007:17. 28) Ibid.:21-22, 27. Van Beizen 1998:215. 29) Key publications in this field are Van Uden 1996, Stroeken 1999, Alma 2005, Van der Lans 2006 and Zock 2007.</page><page sequence="23">208 H. Westerink I Numen 57(2010) 186-211 of a larger totality" and this fact makes a transition into a religious dis course probable when one considers that a sense of participation is the inner core of religious traditions (Stroeken 1999:93). Zock writes that giving meaning should first of all be considered a general human func tion indicating both religious and non-religious processes of the for mation of a world view (Zock 2007:9). Such statements suggest that the issue of giving ultimate meaning as a general human psychological function is religiously neutral, and that under certain circumstances it can open up the domain of the religious. And indeed, exactly this is often put forward in profiling the worldly pastor next to a traditional pastor, or in promoting a more professional mental care. This sup posed neutrality is however somewhat misleading, not only because it suggests that the worldly specialist in questions of existential meaning shares a common ground with psychologists,30 but more importantly because it disregards the fact that in psychology of religion the dis course on giving ultimate meaning is rooted in Fortmann's and Van der Lans' project and their objective to "save" religious experience and the faith of believers. It was in this context that Van der Leeuw and his L?vy-Bruhl reception were taken up, and Sierksmas critical reflections on the phenomenological method were refuted. His work was in a sense implicitly revalued when since the 1970s the constitutive impor tance of projection returned in a discourse on fantasy, imagination and symbolization. Nevertheless, the emphasis on giving ultimate meaning as a general psychic mechanism ? as general as the projection mecha nism in the writings of Vestdijk and Sierksma ? veiled the fact that the importance of the issue emerged out of a discussion between the ology and science of religion, and a theological objective to find a reli gious ground in mystic participation in the context of a secularized modern world characterized by the subject-object dichotomy and by what Fortmann called a one-sided scientific culture. This complex background including the often unrecognized entan glement of psychology of religion and phenomenology of religion should be made more explicit and needs to be analyzed. This will not only help us to better understand the discussions on giving ultimate 30) This suggestion of a common ground (made by for example Zock) is problematic because many psychologists and psychotherapists will not regard 'giving ultimate meaning as belonging to their domain; cf. Stroeken 1997:93.</page><page sequence="24">H. Westerink/ Numen 57(2010) 186-211 209 meaning, but also deepens the self-understanding of those who work as worldly "pastors" in the field of mental care. For psychology of reli gion in the Netherlands its historic entanglement with phenomenol ogy of religion is important to "remember and work through" ? to paraphrase Freud. After all, psychology of religion seems to be in a process of transition, leaving behind the old theological project of con tributing to the relation between theology and faith practice, and instead focusing on what is currently called "lived religion" in and out side religious institutions and traditions in an intercultural context.31 This transition implies a movement towards phenomenological approaches in closer cooperation with religious studies. As history tends to repeat itself, this means ? as Sierksma once did ? taking a critical stance towards implicit theological convictions and objectives that are conspicuous in theories on seemingly general human mental activities. Only this time the objective should not be to articulate the differences between theology and religious studies, but to arrive at a critical self-understanding in the context of interdisciplinarity. In this context and on a theoretical level a certain reappraisal of Sierksmas attempts to combine Freudian psychoanalysis ? especially concerning the issue of helplessness ? philosophical anthropology (centricity vs. eccentricity) and science of religion might be an interesting starting point.
