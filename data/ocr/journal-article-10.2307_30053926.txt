<plain_text><page sequence="1">4URNITURE, SOCIABILITY, AND THE WORK OF LEISURE IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE Mimi Hellman In 1742, Claude-Prosper Jolyot de Crebillon published a novel en- titled Le Sopha (The Sofa).1 A critique of contemporary French society cast in a fic- tional orientalist mode, Le Sopha is set in the court of an indolent sultan. It comprises a selection of erotic tales told by a courtier named Amanzei, whose narrative author- ity has a curious basis: he has personally witnessed the events he describes in the course of previous incarnations, during which his spirit inhabited a series of sofas. Condemned to this condition by the deity Brama as punishment for licentious, hypo- critical conduct during earlier human incarnations, Amanzei is compelled to observe- and, literally, to support-the amorous machinations of others until he can serve as the site of a sincere declaration of love. Thus, our hero migrates from one upholstered host to another, observing variously decorated interiors and the equally diverse mis- adventures of their occupants with the Enlightenment libertine's remarkable combi- nation of voyeuristic delectation and critical analysis. Le Sopha, then, is a novel of manners from the point of view of a decorative object, a story that turns on the im- possible, amusing, and at the same time oddly unsettling suggestion that perceptual and cognitive faculties might lurk unsuspected beneath the inanimate surfaces of do- mestic adornments. I begin with Crebillon's conceit of a sofa as a narrative protagonist because it introduces the notion of a piece of furniture as a social actor, an observant MIMI HELLMAN is the David E.

Crebillon's premise is, of course, utterly fanciful, but much of the cultural and epistemological business of the eighteenth cen- tury was transacted in the guise of invention and entertainment, and the idea of the object-as-narrator offers a valuable insight into the role of furniture in eighteenth- century French social life.2 The relationship between furniture and people in Le Sopha is one of both enticement and uneasiness. The sofa is sumptuous and convenient, perpetually available to receive the body and to display it to advantage. At the same time, however, it is an agent of surveillance, as ready to discern the flaws of its users as it is able to enhance their charms. Its apparently innocent presence as "mere decora- tion" disguises its role as author, its capacity to witness and verbally represent human interactions. I would like to suggest that a similar tension (albeit without Brama's spell) marked the relationship between luxury furniture and elite consumers in the nonfictional social scenarios of eighteenth-century France. Tables, chairs, and other decorative objects were social actors that both facilitated and, in a sense, monitored the leisure acts of privileged society. Through strategically designed aspects of form and function, furniture appeared to accommodate and flatter its users as they pursued such activities as reading, writing, conversing, eating, dressing, and game playing. Through the same design qualities, however, furniture also structured and delimited the behavior and appearance of individuals according to culturally specific codes of social conduct. These individuals, in turn, cultivated a repertoire of visual, corporeal, and social practices and values that was both.required for and further refined by their engagement with furniture. This essay examines the mutually defining interaction of objects and bodies, and the ways in which elite social personae were produced through the formal dynamics and cultural meanings of furniture usage. I call this interaction and its complex conditions the work of leisure, and intend the phrase to convey a double sense: first, that although leisured conduct was meant to appear natural and easy, it was in fact constructed, learned, and very much worked at; second, that elite leisure practices played a key role-did work-in culture and were deeply entwined with, not separate from or oblivious to, political and epistemological systems. The work of leisure, unlike artisanal or commercial work, did not produce material goods through overtly difficult physical labor or exchange them in the marketplace. Rather, it mobi- lized objects made and distributed by others as materials for another mode of making: the apparently effortless fabrication of elite identity itself, an ephemeral product that was as highly crafted as any artful object. Luxury decoration was a crucial component of elite experience in eighteenth-century France. The domestic interiors of privileged individuals were filled with a proliferation of objects characterized by precious materials, a rich design vo- cabulary, and fine craftsmanship: generously cushioned armchairs with carved and gilded frames, cabinets veneered with exotic wood and lacquer panels and embel- lished with glittering bronze mounts, coffee services and figurines of brilliantly glazed porcelain. Decorated spaces were depicted in numerous paintings and prints, described in novels, letters, and memoirs, and represented on the stage. Furniture and fittings were avidly acquired by a range of consumers from many sectors of society, from 416</page><page sequence="3">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure princes to philosophes to newly wealthy financiers to increasingly large numbers of the middle class.3 The boutiques where decorative objects were sold were important arenas for the shaping of taste and the exercise of sociability, attracting both French and foreign elites; the enthusiasm that their sumptuous displays could incite was cap- tured in 1784 by the baroness d'Oberkirch, who visited an establishment called La Couronne d'Or and reported that "one could not approach the shop, there were so many people there; the throng was crowded around a dining-room buffet of admi- rable workmanship."4 This world of things, however, has not tended to attract art histori- ans seeking visual manifestations of major cultural preoccupations. The decorative objects of eighteenth-century France are displayed in major museums, and studied according to the criteria-style, technique, authorship, patronage-favored by con- noisseurship and traditional museology. It is widely acknowledged that interior de- sign was an important vehicle for artistic expression in the eighteenth century. But while questions of social context, representation, and reception have transformed the art-historical analysis of images and buildings, the specific ways in which decorative objects participated in the production of visual and cultural meaning remain largely unexplored.5 It is too easy to assume, perhaps, that the refined elegance and appar- ently unpolemical nature of eighteenth-century adornment indicate a poverty of mean- ing, and that the gilded trappings of elite leisure rendered it an unproblematically delightful condition. The eighteenth-century French interior was delectable, but the cul- tural mechanics of this delectation were far from simple. Historians of the emergence of consumer culture have examined many of the political, economic, and social impli- cations of the production and circulation of goods during the early modern period.6 This scholarship is critical for its emphasis on material goods as potent signifiers, but it locates this signification primarily in the conditions informing the distribution and acquisition of things, rather than in those that governed the manipulation and visual, spatial, or social effects of those things within the interiors for which they were des- tined. This essay will suggest that decorative objects conveyed meaning not simply through possession but also through usage, through a spatial and temporal complicity with the cultivated body that produced the appearance of leisured, sociable ease. The practice of consumption, I will argue, was visual and kinetic; objects were not simply owned, but indeed performed. I Acts of leisure in eighteenth-century France were undertaken in densely decorated interiors characterized by an unprecedented differentiation and specialization of both spaces and objects. In addition to the traditional enfilade of formal rooms, house plans increasingly included additional spaces devoted exclusively to such activities as dining, study, repose, washing, toilet use, and convenient circula- tion between rooms via corridors and small staircases.7 All room types were articu- lated with a diversity of wall treatments, furniture, and fittings executed in a great variety of materials.8 This architectural and decorative complexity was noted by Louis- 417</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 Sebastien Mercier in his Tableau de Paris: "When a house has been built, nothing has yet been done; one has not reached a fraction of the expense. Then come the menuisier, the upholsterer, the painter, the gilder, the sculptor, the ebeniste, and so on; then the mirrors must be hung and the bells installed throughout. The interior takes three times longer than the construction of the h6tel; the antichambers, hidden staircases, closets, and conveniences are endless."9 As Mercier suggests, the decorated interior was a work of art with many authors. Furniture could be designed by an architect, patron, ornemaniste (deco- rative designer), upholsterer, furniture maker, or dealer, and often resulted from col- laboration between members of two or more of these groups. The manufacture of objects was governed by the guild system of the ancien regime, which defined artisanal production according to material and technical categories. Thus, every ingredient and method of workmanship involved in the manufacture of furniture and fittings was the exclusive province of certain craftsmen in certain workshops. Some privileged arti- sans were granted royal exemption from these restrictions, and others escaped regula- tion by working in districts protected by religious authorities, but most were permit- ted to make only parts of things, and a single object was the sum of numerous individuals' contributions.'1 And, although the practice of stamping initials on furni- ture has made it possible for scholars to identify the work of particular menuisiers and ebenistes, the full cast of makers behind a particular object-let alone an entire interior-can never be recovered, and could not have been known to or sought by the consumer." Eighteenth-century viewers certainly relished many of the material, for- mal, and technical aspects of decoration, and recognized certain objects-such as a Boulle marquetry table or piece of Sevres porcelain-as products of particular work- shops or manufactories. But ascribing artistic autonomy to artisans was unthinkable in a culture where notions of authorship and aesthetic value were based on an oppo- sition between the manual, material mechanical arts that produced works unthink- ingly and repetitively, and the intellectual, noble liberal arts that produced works of originality and genius.12 The cultural value of decoration in eighteenth-century France was not as contingent upon makers as it was upon users. One further aspect of the production and circulation of decoration is worth noting. While many objects arrived in the interior directly from the artisanal realm, purchased by a patron or his representative (architect, household staff mem- ber) from the workshop of an ebeniste or tapissier, objects were also acquired through the mediation of luxury merchants known as marchands-merciers. The guild regula- tions of the marchands-merciers forbade them to make objects themselves, but per- mitted them to buy and sell items in any medium, and also to facilitate the production of complex objects whose elements crossed artisanal categories-such as fully equipped dressing tables-by supplying design ideas and sometimes materials to artisans and manufactories and commissioning them to execute the objects.'3 This interpolation of commercial activity between the site of artisanal effort and that of elite leisure in- volved a shift in the cultural meaning of decoration. The marchand-mercier practiced a mode of making that was conceptual and creative, rather than manual and material, and thus was perceived as more noble than the artisan. His project was fundamentally aesthetic, emphasizing practices of artful choice, arrangement, and embellishment. 418</page><page sequence="5">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure Furthermore, French luxury commerce was widely viewed as a profoundly-even pri- marily-social enterprise, involving not only negotiations with makers but also exten- sive polite conversation with consumers.14 Luxury merchants thus played an impor- tant role in converting the products of problematic artisanal labor into elegantly dis- played subjects in a discourse on taste and cultivated sociability, dissociating the ob- ject from work of labor and realigning it with the work of leisure. This brings us, finally, to the interior. Most rooms in a luxuriously decorated house were furnished according to two interdependent systems. Around the perimeter of the room, attached to or arranged against the walls, was a series of objects that occupied fixed positions and often reiterated the materials and motifs of the walls: chimney-pieces, console tables, large pieces such as commodes and armoires, and matched sets of upholstered furniture including beds, sofas, and large chairs. The distribution of these objects was closely related to the highly geometrical scansion of the mural surfaces, and their collective effect was one of tectonic regularity and sym- metry. This group of objects established a unified visual and spatial rhythm that was then inflected and complicated by the second system of things, an array of smaller, lighter pieces such as tables for writing, dressing, game playing, or serving coffee, and additional chairs-some of which matched the larger seat furniture-for reading, con- versing, or reclining. These objects were particularly intricate in design and could be easily moved within or between rooms. They occupied space in a more multidimen- sional and syncopated manner than the large pieces, like visual and spatial accents set against the anchoring presence of the stationary, peripheral objects. Through their arrangement and rearrangement, it was possible to accessorize the fixed furnishings and to refigure spaces to accommodate changing activities and social situations.15 The eighteenth-century French interior thus engaged its occupants on two levels: it was a pre-established setting into which social actors inserted them- selves, inscribing their conduct within a given frame, and it was also an array of props susceptible to manipulation, a mutable mise en scene continuously redesigned by its cast. Individuals were surrounded by a proliferation of diverse things, many of which- especially the smaller, more mobile pieces-were highly specialized items of recent invention. For virtually every mode of leisure activity or social interaction, there was a piece of furniture designed to accommodate its particular conditions. A dressing- table chair, for example, had a low back so it would not impede the hairstyling pro- cess, while a shaving chair featured an adjustable headrest and an extra back leg to carry the weight of a backward-tilted body. Some reclining chairs had backs that could be raised or lowered at the turn of a crank, while others were composed of two or three separate, adjustable sections-seat, footrest, and sometimes a central exten- sion-that tailored repose to the length or position of a particular body. Small tables were equipped with tiered receptacles for storing handwork supplies, or built-in bottle coolers and shelves that provided ready access to wine, silverware, and other items during meals. Fire screens had adjustable panels to shield different parts of the body from direct heat, and were further fitted with candle-holders, footrests, storage com- partments, and writing surfaces. Basic types of objects were produced in a vast array of variations, often specified by the adjectival modification of particular terms. For example, the type of sofa called a canape was available en gondole (higher at the ends 419</page><page sequence="6">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 than in the middle), en corbeille (basket-shaped), and a joues (with corner headrests), while tables were made en chiffonnier (with several small drawers), en vuide-poche (with open compartments for storing small objects), and a pupitre (with a reading stand). Given this intensive articulation of domestic space, this capacity of objects to facilitate the body's every act, it might seem that elite experience was the epitome of comfort and convenience, an oblivion of sumptuous ease. Indeed, a central mythology of eighteenth-century French culture was based on the claim that domestic environments had never before been so commodiously planned and artfully appointed, and that this superior architectural and decorative sensibility was uniquely and essen- tially French.'6 According to the publisher Charles Jombert, in his preface to the 1764 edition of Charles-Etienne Briseux's Architecture moderne, ou l'art de bien batir pour toutes sortes de personnes, the French practice of la distribution, or the composition of plans, had become, in the eighteenth century, "a new art, unknown to the ancients or to foreigners. For it is principally in the art of distributing and arranging with taste the different rooms of an apartment that the architects of our nation have distin- guished themselves...there is no other place in the world where buildings are distrib- uted and interiors decorated with as much elegance, richness, and commodite as they are in our palaces and grand Paris h6tels, as well as in the chateaux and pleasure- pavilions on the outskirts."'7 One of the most hyperbolic accounts of the centrality of artful living to the construction of French cultural identity was Louis-Antoine de Caraccioli's 1777 Paris, le modele des nations etrangeres. Caraccioli described a man of the era before Louis XIV as one who "takes for a magnificent palace a horrible chateau where there are hardly any doors or windows, and where one finds only furnishings that are, in their decrepitude, as ridiculous as they are inconvenient.""18 Following a widely-accepted teleology, he then traced a transformation in domestic aesthetics that gained momentum under Louis XIV, attained perfection under Louis XV, and incited all Europe to eager emulation. Crude manifestations of mere wealth were reformed by refined discernment and judicious acquisition; instead of a "mas- sive sumptuousness that knows only to apply azure and gold, and to spend profusely," the new sensibility was "a question of delightfulness, of graciousness, of commodite, and indeed of magnificence...without French elegance, Europe would have remained gothic, enslaved by its wealth; only as she acquired the fortunate custom of spending appropriately and tastefully has she emerged from her lethargy, and the agreeable melded with the useful to render life sweet and commodious.""9 The accounts of Jombert and Caraccioli highlight themes that pervaded the eighteenth-century French discourse on architecture and decoration: that the French possessed a supreme aes- thetic authority in matters of domestic planning and adornment; that this authority was exercised through practices of tasteful selection and arrangement, more than through any inherent qualities of individual elements; that the sites of quotidian expe- rience were arenas of pleasure and enjoyment as well as utility; and that the interna- tional diffusion of these principles was a potent means of asserting national power. A 1783 engraving after Nicolas Lavreince (fig. 1) seems to typify this mode of elegantly appointed French ease. It depicts une assemblee, a gathering devoted to pleasurable recreation and a mode of sociability that was less explicitly formal than that of grand fetes. Eleven figures occupy a large salon, with one man just 420</page><page sequence="7">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure FIGURE 1. Frangois Dequevauviller after Nicolas Lavreince, L'Assemblee au salon, engraving, 1783. Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, Cabinet des estampes. entering the room and the others engaged in various pursuits. Regularly spaced ar- cades, separated by fluted pilasters and capped by a richly articulated cornice, enframe the windows, doors, and two mirrors placed over a fireplace and a console table.20 Matching light fixtures flank the mirrors, and identical large urns set on pedestals punctuate the corners of the room. Against this framework of repeated, fixed ele- ments, a more dynamic play of objects and bodies unfolds. The arrangement of two game tables and a number of chairs establishes four distinct zones of activity: one for individual reading near a window, two for games toward the center of the space, and one for conversation by the fireplace. The chairs match; in actual rooms, such sets were distributed at regular intervals along the walls-one is visible in this position to the right of the console table-and displaced according to the spatial and social con- ditions of different leisure situations. Taken together, the furnishings surround and enframe the figures, providing a site for every pose and an accompaniment for every interaction. Yet these people seem to walk, sit, or stand with naturalness and ease, and all seem absorbed in their activities. It is as if we, like the man by the open door, have entered the room unobserved; and, to adopt Caraccioli's terms, we seem to have come upon a plenitude of delightfulness, graciousness, and commodite. But well-accessorized ease was not a natural condition. Its terms were complex and culturally specific, and their mastery posed a tremendous concep- tual, physical, and social challenge. As domestic space became increasingly differenti- ated, and as an expanding typology of furniture offered a panoply of objects tailored 421</page><page sequence="8">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 to specific practices, the negotiation of the interior-both linguistically and physi- cally-became a more complicated project as well. It became a topos in the discourse on decoration to call for directories and translations to guide consumers through an ever-changing world of things whose magnitude threatened to outstrip the capacity of language to describe it. A 1755 issue of the Mercure de France advertised a "Pocket- dictionary of all new and current terms used in fashionable society with regard to dining, equipage, furnishing, men's and women's tailoring and fashions of all sorts,"21 while Mercier remarked in the Tableau de Paris that "I would have liked to provide here a little dictionary of fashions and their singularities, but the language of the shops would have changed while I was writing it; within a month no one would have comprehended what I was saying, and I would have required a commentary to make myself understood."22 The decorated interior required an operator's manual. Dense and mutable, it demanded not only a sophisticated vocabulary, but also great corpo- real and social eloquence. The culture that defined itself as an exemplary practitioner of l'art de vivre did indeed need guidance in its pursuit of comfort and delight, and this guidance was supplied at the very locus of the problem, by the subtle yet powerful system of decoration itself. II The mediation of elite experience by objects was a key part of what Norbert Elias has called "the civilizing process," the emergence during the early mod- ern period of a system that measured social status in terms of increasingly nuanced behavioral standards that were codified in conduct manuals.23 The civilizing process sought to mask corporeal reality with a screen of politeness. It charged the body with new prohibitions and sensitivities (particularly, in Elias's account, with regard to ali- mentary, sexual, and bodily functions), developed a complex repertoire of rituals to govern these newly problematic acts, and equipped the individual with a battery of objects to accompany those rituals. Ultimately, the codes of civility became such an integral part of social life that their rules were increasingly unspoken, enforcing them- selves simply through their apparent logic and naturalness. For Elias, as for most historians of early modern culture, texts are the primary evidence for this policing of social behavior. I will turn later to the litera- ture on manners, but first I want to focus on objects, for the role of tables and chairs in the cultural construction of civility was no less-and perhaps even more-powerful than the explicit didacticism of the conduct manual. Furniture offered instruction by offering convenience and pleasure, governing the civilized body through interventions that seemed to enable even as they restrained. Furniture elicited aesthetically and so- cially desirable conduct from its users precisely by appearing not to regulate their behavior, by a strategy of prescription through agreeable accommodation that was, as we shall see, the essence of elite sociability itself. The social power of furniture lay in its visually and spatially com- plex forms and its combination of specialized and flexible functions. Objects simulta- neously scripted action and invited manipulation, and could be negotiated effortlessly only through great familiarity, attention, and mastery. Consider, for example, a table 422</page><page sequence="9">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure and tea-table (table and tea-table (table a ouvrage et a ecrire en cabaret), with stamp of ebeniste Jean-Louis Faizelot Delorme, c. 1760. Paris, Musee du :Louvre. Photo RMN-Arnaudet. a ouvrage et a e'crire en cabaret (handwork, writing, and tea table), which is decorated with marquetry, topped with a marble plaque, and punctuated with gilded bronze mounts, including key escutcheons and side carrying handles (fig. 2). It is approxi- mately twenty-six inches tall, with an upper surface of about ten by twelve inches. In its small case, it incorporates a pull-out writing slide (in upper center front), a built-in inkwell (in right side), and two drawers, and it originally may have been accessorized with a small tea set (cabaret). This object is both flexible and limited in function: it can be used for writing, beverage service, and/or the storage of small items, but not for game-playing or dressing. It can be easily placed alongside any chair in any room and will keep within reach a variety of articles used for several different activities. The very mobility and convenience of the object, however, rendered it challenging to use. Consider the foreknowledge and delicate, two-fingered touch required to locate and grasp a slide-pull the size of a fingernail, or to insert and turn a tiny key; consider the instability of the entire tea set-garnished ensemble in the way of a sudden or ill-placed gesture or a sweep of voluminous skirt. Such an object had as great a capacity to expose an individual's awkwardness as to emphasize his or her graceful control. Some side tables were constructed on an even smaller scale, with barely enough surface area to hold a candlestick or a snuffbox. Sharing space with such objects-and the flaming, spillable, or breakable items they were meant to sup- 423</page><page sequence="10">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 port-was both an opportunity and a risk: one might highlight one's gestural virtuos- ity, or betray a lack of control. Perhaps the very possibility of flirting with accident, yet not succumbing to it, carried a certain fascination and socioaesthetic appeal for both those who engaged such objects and those who observed their conduct. Many other specialized yet flexible objects similarly provided acts of leisure with both support and direction, as well as a physical challenge. Game tables, for example, often incorporated numerous playing surfaces, concealed beneath removable lids or slidinglike drawers out of the body of the piece, offering a sort of preprogrammed menu of possibilities for play. Some included features such as recep- tacles for dice, markers, and other accessories, fixtures for holding teacups or glasses or supporting candelabra, and retractable fire screens. Game tables were constructed without stretchers or lower shelves, and so could be set directly over the laps of the players. Thus installed, facing one another across the playing surface, individuals were brought into close, yet mediated proximity. Both connected and separated by the pres- ence of the object, they engaged in visual and verbal interaction accompanied by a continuous, collective manipulation of the apparatus. As they mapped their own pat- terns of choice and strategy upon the compliant object, they were also quite literally confined by it, their lower bodies immobilized beneath its surface and their gestures curtailed by an arrangement of carefully positioned markers, or a burning candle or a stemmed liqueur glass positioned near the elbow. The greater the formal and functional complexity of a piece of fur- niture, the greater its capacity to elicit from-or deny-the user an appearance of grace and ease. The complexity of objects often was not immediately apparent.24 Many incorporated concealed or disguised elements, and using them required a privileged knowledge of their structure, as well as a certain physical dexterity. A seemingly simple, legible form could be a facade for another, hidden feature: a series of drawers might be simulations covering the drop front of a desk; a row of book bindings on a shelf might be a painted shutter over a set of pigeonholes. Some objects combined actual drawers with false ones that could not be opened. Others contained layered or nested elements that had to be penetrated progressively: cupboard doors covered drawers that in turn contained compartments with separately hinged lids. Surfaces were fre- quently reversible and bifunctional; a panel in the top of a table might be a mirror or lacquered reading stand on one side, and a leather writing surface or game-board on the other. The workings of many objects were mechanically activated: a variety of buttons, knobs, ratchets, cranks, or keys, sometimes hidden in the marquetry or gilded- bronze decoration of the piece, triggered internal systems of springs, levers, and locks. In some cases, a sequence of interventions had to be executed in a particular order before all the attributes of an object were fully revealed. Even the relatively modest table in figure 2 is more artful than its initial appearance may suggest: there is no drawer behind the uppermost key escutcheon, and the symmetry of the two handles belies the presence of the inkwell behind one of them. To operate these kinds of objects smoothly, individuals had to be intimately familiar with them. A well-executed series of manipulations on the part of the user yielded a series of formal and functional transformations on the part of the object; usage was a kind of joint performance by both person and thing. But furniture 424</page><page sequence="11">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure not only had users, it also had viewers. The deployment of objects and the related corporeal conduct of their executants took place in a social context, producing visual and spatial effects in the presence of an audience. This performance was shaped not only by the complex structure of objects, but also by their diverse contents. Inside the proliferation of internal spaces provided by tables, desks, and chests of drawers was the vast battery of small props-from novels to napkins to needles-required for a variety of activities. Elite leisure was a social spectacle based on a continuous engage- ment with complicated things, an ongoing process of opening and closing, searching and selecting, storing and retrieving. This process was riddled with both moments of potential elegance and drama and moments of potential awkwardness. Still images and static museum displays make it difficult to imagine how objects and bodies must have looked in action, but this is precisely what we must do if we are to understand the performative role of furniture in the larger theater of elite social life. To this end, let us consider a specific example. One type of furniture that vividly suggests the ways in which structure, contents, and the techniques of usage combined to produce social spectacle is the dressing table, or table de toilette. These objects generally appeared at first to be merely flat tables with unusually deep bodies, but could be manipulated to reveal mirrors, reading and writing surfaces, and numerous drawers, cupboards, and subdivided compartments. Their contents could include not only articles related to grooming-such as water jugs and basins, cosmet- ics, soap and sponge boxes, shaving equipment, face patches, combs, wigs, ribbons, and jewelry-but also tea sets, lighting fixtures, books, and materials for writing, handwork, and even game playing. One table de toilette (figs. 3-4), which retains most of its original fixtures, is worth describing in detail. The object is essentially a deep rectangular box measuring approxi- mately 33 inches high by 27 inches wide. It is veneered with a geometric pattern executed in five types of wood, embellished with gilded bronze mounts, and set on fluted legs that end in castors.25 It incorporates two separable elements that may be used individually or in combination. The top half is a removable, tripartite bed table. Its central panel (A) may be raised vertically by a ratchet and provides a reading stand on one side and a mirror on the other, each released by a separate button. When this panel is elevated, small objects can be placed in the shallow recess (B) exposed at its base. Flanking the panel are two compartments (C, D) whose hinged lids rotate 180 degrees to form extended wings on which objects can be placed, and in the center front is a drawer (E) that contains a removable inkstand and is covered by a hinged lid that can serve as a writing surface. The bed table is mounted on four short legs that fit into wells (F) at the four corners of the lower half of the object. When the bed table is removed, the wells can be covered by tiny hinged lids and the remaining object (now twenty-nine inches high) is a marble-topped table. It has a deep drawer in each of the short ends (G, H), and each long side is fitted with a pull-out writing slide (I). All the drawers in the object are lined with silk and divided into shaped compartments, which contain the following items: in (C) two deep saucers and a covered cup of Sevres porcelain, a cup, sponge box, powder box, and funnel of silver gilt, and a lacquer needle case; in (D) three covered jars of the same porcelain, four rock crystal flasks with silver gilt lids, an ivory-handled knife, a lacquer box, and a tortoise-shell eyelash comb; in (G) two cups and saucers, two cream jugs, and a covered sugar bowl, all of 425</page><page sequence="12">FIGURE 3.

Objects like this were veritable arsenals for the project of elite self- fashioning and sociability. The dressing table in eighteenth-century France was the focal point of the toilette, a multifaceted ritual practiced daily by both men and women.26 Seated before the table and manipulating its contents-alone or with the help of servants-the protagonist of the toilette composed the physical and social self before an audience, arranging the appearance of face, hair, and body while receiving a procession of visitors which could include family members, general or intimate ac- quaintances, lovers, business associates, household staff, merchants, creditors, and religious advisors, as well as writers, artists, or other individuals seeking or already supported by his or her patronage. Numerous images and textual references identify the toilette as a primarily female pursuit, and associate it disparagingly with sexuality, frivolity, and dissimulation. But it was also an occasion for defining the intellectual, social, and political universe of the protagonist through the exchange of information and ideas on a wide range of subjects, and the forging or reiteration of relationships involving various patterns of alliance, obligation, and power. Consider the possible roles of the table de toilette in the progress of this enterprise. Its multivalent structure offered numerous possible combinations of parts and accessories, and each of these would have involved a particular spatial de- ployment of the object and a particular pose or gestural sequence on the part of the user. Each interaction of object and body would have been observed by those in atten- dance at the toilette, and could well have been designed by the protagonist to convey nonverbal messages-from the erotic to the economic-to members of this audience. It is important here to explore not only what users might do with objects, but also how they might look while doing it, and what their conduct might mean to differently positioned viewers. Opening the uppermost lidded compartments might extend the arm in a graceful way, while bending over the writing surface might emphasize the curve of a powdered neck. The process of sugaring a cup of chocolate or sorting through a box of hair ornaments might suggest one's discriminating taste-both lit- eral and metaphoric-or status as a privileged consumer of luxury goods. Joint usage of the table, made possible by the porcelain for two and the double writing slides, might create or reinforce a sense of intimacy between two individuals. The perfor- mance of some delicate operation-like using the tiny funnel to transfer perfume from one small flask to an even smaller one-might attract and hold the spectator's gaze, keeping him suspended in attendance while the protagonist's own concentration is diverted by objects. This act could produce either connection or distance between interlocutors: it might fascinate and entice an admirer, or suggest the relative unimportance of a social inferior. These scenarios are obviously speculative, but they begin to suggest the wide range of material, physical, and social configurations that could be based on a single piece of furniture. A description of the toilette in Pierre-Joseph Boudier de Villemert's 1758 L'ami des femmes further suggests the ways in which the manipula- tion of objects and movements could highlight particular aspects of the body: "One 427</page><page sequence="14">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 refastens a bracelet to expose a lovely arm; one readjusts yet again a necklace or nosegay to draw attention to the whiteness of the neck; one laughs to show off beau- tiful teeth; one makes a false move, one changes the position of a face-patch, one alters one's pose each moment to inspire men with renewed feelings of admiration."27 This account exemplifies a more general capacity of objects to assist in the construc- tion of self-image by occasioning artful gestures and focusing the gaze of spectators. The social progress of the toilette was inextricable from the physical, visual process of unfolding, unpacking, and manipulating the dressing table and its contents. The com- plex object offered so many possibilities that its usage appeared to be an exercise in individual choice and invention, rather than visibly scripted action..The table de toi- lette can be understood as a figure for the system of furniture as a whole: a multiva- lent, flexible collection of tools that enabled individuals to choreograph their appear- ance, direct the attention of viewers, and thus shape the rhythm and meaning of inter- actions. The ability to control social relationships required a simultaneously demon- strated ability to effectively manage furniture; the specialized knowledge and physical acuity required for the smooth handling of intricately structured and potentially un- stable objects implied a similar authority in the less tangible arena of interpersonal dynamics. Furniture continually provided elite consumers with the opportunity, to adopt a phrase from sociologist R. S. Perinbanayagam, "to do self with things."28 The case furniture discussed so far brought bodies into close, inter- active proximity with objects, but seat furniture involved an even more intimate col- lusion. Like other objects, chairs and sofas were highly specialized, and structured the conduct of the body while appearing to accommodate agreeably the particular needs of different activities. A desk chair, for example, had a seat that projected strongly at the center front, and its legs were placed at the center front, center back, and sides of the seat (rather than at the four corners); additional support was sometimes supplied by the addition of a fifth leg. This design was meant to suit perfectly someone leaning forward over a desk. The menuisier Andre-Jacob Roubo, in a treatise on furniture manufacture, described the object as a direct response to corporeal conditions: "[It is] very comfortable for those who are obliged to remain sitting and leaning forward for long periods, as all those who write must do. In such circumstances, the thighs are parted and carry the weight equally, and are not bruised by the front crosspiece of the chair; this, being curved, allows the entire weight of the body to rest on the front part of the seat and thus on the inner part of the thigh, which being the fleshiest is most resistant to fatigue."29 The desk chair did indeed facilitate a pose of evenly distributed body weight and parted thighs, but it also rendered any other pose virtually impos- sible. The chair offered comfort and ease only if the user recognized and submitted to the dictates of its design. The object seemed to respond naturally to the body only if the body first responded properly to it. Roubo identified commodite as the most important concern of chair design, and suggested numerous strategies-many evident in extant examples-for shaping objects to accommodate elaborately clothed figures, avoid entanglement with hairstyles, and fit the dimensions of specific spaces or even specific bodies.30 Many objects featured deep, low seats and generously stuffed cushions that conveyed a sense of abundance and comfort. These attributes probably did provide the seated indi- 428</page><page sequence="15">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure FIGURE 5. Canape a confidents, engraved by Daumont after Jean-Charles Delafosse, c. 1770. Paris, Bibliotheque nationale, Cabinet des estampes. vidual with a certain physical pleasure, and certainly they produced an appearance of splendidly ensconced ease. But to sink gracefully into or arise from such pieces- especially in eighteenth-century clothing-required great physical control.31 A chair might seem to be a more manageable object than a multichambered dressing table, but it too required the user to, so to speak, plug into it and unplug from it. Social events often involved much perambulation and changing of seats, so these transi- tional moments occurred often and publicly, and were not easy to accomplish smoothly and without visible sign of effort.32 Another object that scripted the enactment of leisure was a type of sofa called a canape a confidents (fig. 5). It was designed on a half-oval plan and divided into three sections, so that the individuals seated on the end sections were positioned at oblique angles to those in the center. Bodies arranged in this way were literally embedded within the structure of the piece, closely proximate yet distinctly separate, their interaction mediated by the object in much the same way as that of game players around a table. But individuals using this object did not face one an- other-indeed, the object conspired against it. The canape a confidents was part of the fixed furnishings of a room, placed against the wall or in a shallow niche. Thus, its occupants would have faced out into the room in three directions, easily able to sur- vey the space before them, but if they wished to converse they would have had to do so without direct visual access to one another, or by turning their bodies or heads against the directional thrust of the object. At the same time, in their position against a mural surface, which would have been covered by fabric, tapestry, painting, sculpted panels, or mirror glass, they would have been readily available to the gaze of other individuals in the room. 429</page><page sequence="16">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 Thus arranged, literally anchored within the decorative scheme of the room, the occupants of the canape were simultaneously observers and potential objects of observation. From their position, interior space opened before them like a stage, with the social interactions of others as its spectacle. Conversely, from the per- spective of a viewer within that space, they themselves formed a living tableau, a picturesque composition of heads and torsos posed at different angles within the frame of the object and the frame of the background mural zone. Moreover, since canapes were frequently placed in niches bordered by gilded moldings or curtains, the bodies seated on them were often enframed in an explicitly pictorial or theatrical manner. Scopic positions could shift at any time, as the individuals on the sofa traded places with others elsewhere in the room. In fact, the very structure of the object may have encouraged a sort of social and temporal, as well as visual syncopation of bodies, with its perchlike end sections inviting individuals to alight briefly for exchanges with those installed in the center. The example of the canape a confidents highlights a condition that was fundamental to social experience in eighteenth-century France: the double posi- tion of viewing and being viewed. The capacity of furniture to shape the play of spectatorship was perhaps most explicitly articulated in a type of chair called a voyeuse-literally, a chair for looking. Used during game-playing sessions, these ob- jects were produced in several different models. A voyeuse for a spectator (fig. 6) was designed to be straddled backwards by a man or knelt upon backwards by a woman, with the elbows resting on the upholstered top rail, in order to watch players seated around a table. The examples illustrated here ensure these gendered positions through differentiated design: the one on the left has a lower, broader seat to accommodate the full skirt and weight distribution of a kneeling woman, while the one on the right has a higher, saddle-shaped seat to suit the straddling pose of a man in close-fitting breeches. While larger items of seat furniture often seemed to enframe the body, these objects became virtually fused with it. The body must almost embrace the object: outstretched arms and a man's parted legs would extend over and around it; a woman's skirt would obscure the lower part of her chair and she would appear to be kneeling on air. Another type of voyeuse, essentially an armchair whose back section was surmounted with an upholstered shelf, was used by player and spectator together: the player sat in the chair in the usual manner, and the spectator stood behind the chair and leaned on the shelf to observe the game. This conjunction of bodies, like that of the game table or canape a confidents, brought individuals into close proxim- ity to one another while still assigning each a separate position with respect to the shared object. Spectatorship was thus rendered spectacle; acts of looking and being looked at were formalized and aestheticized through the intervention of a physical device. The existence of specialized furniture that so precisely engineered what may seem to be the most casual and natural of supporting social roles-the mere bystander at a game-suggests not only that leisured sociability could not exist without objects, but also that it could not exist without viewers. To adopt a term from the work of architectural historian Mark Wigley, furniture in eighteenth-century France was prosthetic, an artificial extension of the body that enabled its management of physical and social space.33 The system of 430</page><page sequence="17">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure FIGURE 6.

Photo courtesy of Rosenberg &amp; Stiebel gallery. objects refigured the body in much the same way as the system of clothing, encourag- ing specific types of poses and gestures-and making them seem natural-through designs that shaped the body's movement and appearance. Clothing produced a spe- cific corporeal aesthetic not only through obvious devices such as corsets and hooped skirts, but also through subtler strategies: stiff facings that held men's coat-skirts away from the body; breeches that were tight in the highly visible front but baggy in the never-visible seat, facilitating greater ease of movement; shoes with heels that slanted sharply toward the instep, producing a light, tiptoeing gait; armholes cut high and set toward the backs of both men's and women's garments, holding the arms backward and away from the body and emphasizing the chest.34 The objects I have discussed- from the tiny tea table to the dressing table to the voyeuse-also shaped the conduct and appearance of elite individuals through a similar dynamic of enabling and re- straint. The body was thus doubly disciplined by its adornments-by its decorative dressing and its decorated environment-but the codes of elite social representation insisted that this discipline must remain invisible. Perhaps the most highly valued attribute of the cultivated persona was the appearance of effortless ease, but the very things that purported to facilitate ease also posed a perpetual challenge to its attain- ment. I would like to turn now to a closer examination of the attributes of the culti- vated body in eighteenth-century France, in order to argue not only that furniture orchestrated leisure according to basic ideals of polite conduct, but also that it ac- 431</page><page sequence="18">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 tively shaped those ideals and was thus one of the culture's most powerful instruments for the production of elite social aesthetics. III The discourse on domestic planning and decoration in eighteenth- century France was, as we have seen, based on a mythology that credited the French with a superior sense of commodite, tasteful embellishment, and graceful living. Re- lated to this cluster of associations was another mythology of inherent national sensi- bility that identified the French as unrivaled practitioners of the art of politeness.35 According to this view, sociability in France from the age of Richelieu onward became an increasingly nuanced, aestheticized enterprise, a national passion that elevated in- teraction beyond mere decorum to a highly pleasurable and influential mode of ex- pression. In Caraccioli's account, "It is not given to all men to possess this engaging and easy spirit that wins trust and pleases in all countries...Europeans, almost all withdrawn, became communicative only when they adopted French manners.""36 To animate their uniquely agreable interiors, French elites required equally-and, I will argue, analogously-agreable manners. "Politeness," explained l'abbe de Bellegarde in his Reflexions sur le ridicule, "is a mixture of discretion, civility, complaisance, circumspection, and mod- esty, accompanied by an agreeable air that emanates from all that one says and all that one does."37 The central strategy of polite behavior was to employ restraint in order to convey a pleasing appearance of unselfconscious ease.38 At rest and in mo- tion, cultivated individuals demonstrated a self-contained yet relaxed carriage; smooth movements that were neither too rapid nor too slow; a limited range of gestures that were neither broad nor jerky; and facial expressiveness without grimacing, staring, or a darting gaze. In conversation, they spoke in modulated tones; avoided large ges- tures, fidgeting, and pedantic subjects; did not expound at length on a single topic; did not talk about themselves; did not allow their pose or gaze to appear confronta- tional; and preferred circumlocution and euphemism to blunt statements. Politeness also involved a masking of the body's corporeality, not only by concealing such phe- nomena as sneezing, yawning, and chewing, but also by avoiding any poses or ges- tures that emphasized extreme physicality or force-such as planting oneself abruptly in front of another person, or stamping one's foot-and seeking instead a general impression of weightlessness. The cultivated body was thus a carefully balanced mecha- nism in a state of constant self-control. The primary motivation for the system of politeness was social rather than personal: the goal of cultivated conduct was first and foremost to please, to give delight and satisfaction to others. According to l'abbe Trublet, "Politeness consists of doing nothing and saying nothing that could displease others, and doing and saying all that can please them, and doing so with manners and a mode of expression in- formed by nobility, ease, keenness, and delicacy."39 The polite individual's first prior- ity was attention to the sensitivities, preferences, and self-interest (amour-propre) of others. He suppressed any behavior that might be offensive, avoided any suggestion of his own amour-propre, and sought to make his interlocutor feel like the protago- 432</page><page sequence="19">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure nist of their interaction. The system of politeness thus turned on a paradox: each individual was required to please others without appearing to be pleased with him- self, and at the same time was expected to be pleased by others because they too were engaged in the same self-effacing pursuit. The net result was a sort of conspiracy of mutual pleasing in which everyone was both an agent and a recipient; polite sociabil- ity was a collective enterprise in which everyone's pleasure was elicited-and everyone's amour-propre stimulated despite itself-by the intervention of an outside party. One of the most important techniques of polite sociability was a continuous process of observation and adjustment. In order to focus on others and to appear entirely unselfconscious, the individual was required to maintain a perpetual but imperceptible state of awareness, surveying her shifting social circumstances and revising her conduct according to numerous variables, such as the social identity of different interlocutors and the site, time, and purpose of different interactions. Bellegarde emphasized the importance of these patterns of correspondence, or les biensdances: It is necessary to pay close attention to oneself, in order to disen- tangle what is appropriate from what should be avoided. Les bienseances are endless in their extent: sex, age, profession, charac- ter, time, and place impose different obligations, and it is necessary to recognize these differences, and submit to them, if one wishes to fashion oneself to the taste of the world. Whatever merit you may have, if you dispense with an observation of les bienseances, you will be taken for an impolite man who knows not how to live, and who has no awareness of that which is pleasing.40 Behavioral correctness, then, was a relative and continuously shifting condition, de- manding practices of assessment, analysis, and self-surveillance. This had to be ac- complished, however, with apparent naturalness, ease, and spontaneity, for the same system of elite aesthetics that privileged artistic invention over artisanal labor also eschewed any suggestion of laboriousness in social interaction.41 Notions of work were often invoked by writers to warn against conduct that suggested premeditation, effort, or a too-literal application of rules. Antoine de Courtin, in his Nouveau traite de la civilite, criticized those whose behav- ior was "so constrained, so studied and so regulated that they seem to make a trade of them rather than wishing to learn them."42 Bellegarde noted that "[i]t is a great art simply to affect nothing, and to appear natural in everything," and asserted that the broadly cultivated homme de qualite was more socially adept than conduct specialists such as dancing masters, because "those who excell in some Art, and have not the least desire to go beyond the Rules of their profession, appear encumbered and con- strained because they force naturalness."43 The truly accomplished elite individual was not professionally artful but rather naturally artful; the work of leisure must seem not to be work at all. On the other hand, the pleasure and prestige of easy manners emerged partly from a recognition of the challenges they involved. As Nicolas Faret suggested in L'Honnete homme ou l'art de plaire a la Cour, "as every one knows the Difficulty of doing excellent Things, they admire those who do them with Ease."44 433</page><page sequence="20">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 / 4 Here was another paradox at the heart of politeness: individuals judged one another according to an ideal of "naturalness" that could only be achieved through accom- plished performance. Moreover, since every spectator was also an actor, the experi- ence of ease was inevitably informed by the experience of difficulty, however unspo- ken it necessarily remained. In the highly nuanced performance of politeness, one of the most important instruments was the body. Pose, gaze, gesture, and speech were crucial means of producing the signs of attentiveness and ease that were central to elite social representation. But the body signified not only through what it did and said-or what it refrained from doing and saying-but also through the way it looked, through its very presence as a purely abstract, kinetic object moving in space.45 Sarah Cohen has shown that "a social connoisseurship of the body" was fundamental to both the mak- ing and viewing of images and the experience of social spectacle (notably dance) in early eighteenth-century France.46 She traces a "honing of corporeal sensibilities" in which elite individuals developed an acutely observant, highly sophisticated under- standing of the somatic, focusing on the capacity of the body for diverse visual and spatial play as a subject of aesthetic interest in and of itself. This new appreciation of the body as animate form-as a shifting composition of planes and angles, extensions and rotations-informed not only the experience of spectatorship but also the experi- ence of conduct: a more attentive discernment of other bodies was conducive to a greater awareness of one's own body as something to be discerned by others. The foundation and principal manifestation of this newly refined corporeal aesthetic was the art of dance. An essential part of elite social education, dance-like other modes of polite interaction-emphasized an appearance of flow- ing, weightless, effortless ease, and a self-conscious awareness of the body's posture and movement in space. Moreover, Cohen has suggested that dance not only sharp- ened viewers' perceptions of bodies themselves, but also encouraged them to appreci- ate the elegant, invisible patterns traced by dancers' movements as equally aestheti- cally compelling.47 This double reading of dance as both bodily presence and spatial pattern is invoked in a plate from Kellom Tomlinson's 1735 The Art of Dancing (fig. 7): beneath the feet of two figures in exemplary poses is a delicate trail of points and lines that corresponds to their movements. Other pages in this and similar texts depict dance as graphic transcription only, marks inscribed within a square that indicates the shape of a room. This representational practice, new at the beginning of the eigh- teenth century, further suggests that individuals could envision the appearance of their own movements from an external point of view, conceiving conduct as visual and spatial display from the simultaneous perspectives of performer and spectator. Moderate, observant, accommodating, pleasing, natural, and emit- ting the invisible traces of aesthetically significant movements, the polite individual was an amalgam of carefully considered and artfully executed acts. The behavior of bodies, however, was impossible without the concomitant behavior of furniture, so it is time to bring objects back into this discussion. It should be clear by now that ob- jects not only provided the tools for performances of leisured sociability, but also required individuals to exercise the attributes of polite conduct that I have just sum- 434</page><page sequence="21">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure FIGURE 7.

Tables that were tiny, unstable, or intricately structured could only be nego- tiated through physical restraint and light, delicate movements. The complexity and flexibility of copiously accessorized tables de toilette made it possible to adjust the progress of interactions according to different circumstances and relationships, and made interventions seem personal and spontaneous rather than premeditated or pre- scribed. The shapes of desk chairs, day beds, and voyeuses produced bodily positions that appeared relaxed and natural. In short, the practices of containment, adjustment, and apparent ease that were so vital to the construction of social personae were all occasioned by interactions between bodies and objects. Furthermore, we have also seen that the process of engaging furniture strongly emphasized the body's formal attributes-the angle of a leg, the turn of a neck-and produced extended sequences of complex gestural patterns. The pictorializing and performative aspects of object usage strongly suggest that elite individuals brought the same techniques of percep- tion and self-visualization identified by Cohen to the conduct and delectation of what might be called their dances with things. 435</page><page sequence="22">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 But objects did even more than elicit correct conduct and corporeal refinement, for through their very forms and functions they themselves demonstrated the basic attributes of polite cultivation. Like vigilant, other-oriented individuals, ob- jects seemed to anticipate and accommodate flexibly the terms of every situation. When Nicolas Faret enjoined the solicitous interlocutor to "keep so near, as to adjust every Discourse to [the other's] Capacity," he equally might have been describing the way a mobile reading and writing stand with firescreen or a tripartite, adjustable duchesse brisee seemed ever ready to adapt to the changing needs of particular users.48 Moreover, like polite people, objects were agents that highlighted and enhanced the attributes of others in a social system that eschewed any appearance of self-promoting amour-propre. When a canape confidents provided an aestheticizing frame for bod- ies, or when a table de toilette occasioned elegant movements, individuals were ren- dered attractive almost coincidentally; their compelling appearances could be con- strued as the consequences of actions innocently focused elsewhere (on speaking, on searching for a comb), rather than as direct, deliberate exhibitionism. Like good inter- locutors, objects made individuals look and feel like artful protagonists, offering pre- mises that enabled potentially problematic acts of authorship to be executed in the guise of seemingly natural reception and response. Objects, then, were exemplary social actors. Interestingly, some were even named after social types (duchesse, marquise, bergere), or were verb-based nouns suggesting personified action (voyeuse, veilleuse).49 In visual and kinetic terms, too, they often seem to possess anthropomorphic qualities: the swelling bodies of cabinets and the turned-out arms and legs of chairs suggest bodily surfaces and positions, while the smooth, multidimensional sliding, rising, bending, and rotating of complex pieces resemble the fluid yet controlled movements of dancers." And, with their glossy, brightly colored, highly articulated skins of wood veneer, lacquer, and textiles, lav- ishly trimmed with passementerie and metalwork, objects possessed many of the same surface qualities as the richly clothed bodies of their users. Relationships between objects and bodies were like mimetic dialogues between interdependent protagonists operating according to the same criteria. But perhaps the most important analogy between objects and indi- viduals was that their social strategies had the same fundamental basis: the art of pleasing. The engaging manners of objects, like those of polite people, allowed them to shape the form and content of social exchange far more effectively than any overtly difficult or authoritarian presence. The idea that pleasing was not merely enjoyable but in fact tactical was central to the ideology of polite conduct. As Bellegarde ex- plained, "The surest means of possessing minds and enlisting people to do us good turns is to influence them by sweet and insinuating manners, by agreeableness, by solicitousness. Conversely, harshness, impoliteness and brusqueness embitter them and sometimes oblige them to turn against us, whatever good intentions they had of serving us."51 To please, then, was to have power. Furniture pleased by virtue of its beauty, variety, and convenience, and because it pleased it could also influence, incit- ing users to desirable behavior through sweet urging and insinuation. Indeed, objects were potentially more potent and desirable teachers of elite sociability than texts on proper behavior, whose systematically presented precepts often emphasized direction 436</page><page sequence="23">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure more than gratification. Elite cultural aesthetics in the eighteenth century privileged modes of explication characterized by formal diversity and clever conceits, as op- posed to those perceived as monolithic, pedantic, or explicitly didactic. The interde- pendence of instruction and delight was frequently identified as a particularly French preoccupation, and was exemplified by certain textual forms such as fictional letters or dialogues, assorted thoughts (pensees detachees), and novels.52 Thus, Bellegarde was at pains to present his Reflexions sur le ridicule as a lapidary collection of pensees detachees rather than boring "traitez complets" (complete treatises), for "the abrupt and impetuous French spirit loves change and new subjects; long discourses on the same topic bore it, while the hope of seeing new vistas and making new discoveries piques its curiosity."53 Aesthetics, entertainment, and knowledge were inseparable in eighteenth-century France. Information for elite consumers had to be amusingly-one might also say decoratively-packaged, and I would argue that a roomful of artful objects offered at least as many occasions for pleasing education as a library of divert- ing books. In addition to its euphemistic approaches to the dissemination and consumption of ideas, elite culture also valued ephemeral means of defining and trans- mitting its practices. Theorists of politeness often insisted that the best teacher of sociability was society itself; correct behavior was most effectively learned through sustained observation and imitation of exemplary individuals in actual situations. "One can better comprehend society only by observing it," cautioned Pons-Augustin Alletz in his Manuel de l'homme du monde, "those who claim to know it through the aid of books do not know it at all."54 Exposure to polite company, assured Bellegarde, resulted in an almost automatic mimetic response: "One insensibly becomes perme- ated by politeness and urbanity when one often observes polite persons; interaction with those one respects inspires agreeableness, sweetness, and refinement, but they must be observed with attention."55 This kind of experiential learning was exactly what furniture also provided. Consorting attentively with agreeable objects, and al- lowing one's conduct to be inspired and corrected by them, yielded a degree of visual, corporeal, and social virtuosity that could not be gained from texts. Indeed, I would suggest that the proliferation of complex furniture-and therefore complex sociabil- ity-during the eighteenth century was linked to a growing impulse among elites to complicate and privatize the art of conduct, bringing it beyond the level of the textu- ally transmittable at a time when conduct guides were widely available to an expand- ing range of middle-class consumers. Perhaps booby-trapping the interior, so to speak, with objects that could equally induce either elegance or error was a way of raising the stakes in the game of identity formation: if the material signs of status had become all too easy to purchase, it was important that they become not so easy to perform. IV The decorated interior in eighteenth-century France was a veritable machine a loisir, an apparatus that produced performances of sociability in accor- dance with culturally specific ideals of cultivated behavior. It was not a site for the retreat from work and relaxation of rules that inform our own conception of leisure, but rather an arena for a complex and paradoxical enterprise that simultaneously 437</page><page sequence="24">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 required and masked effort, rendered rules natural and pleasing, made acting and viewing interchangeable roles, and became a key means of defining elite cultural real- ity. If we return now to the engraving after Lavreince (fig. 1) intro- duced near the beginning of this essay, the scene should now have a density that was not immediately apparent at first viewing. Indeed, it could be annotated with ac- counts of the diverse origins of decorative elements, the codes that governed even basic acts like walking and talking, and the challenges that furniture posed to convey- ing a graceful appearance. But images like this, together with the glittering remains of actual furnished spaces, have long led historians to assume that elite social activity in the eighteenth century was an easy business. We will only understand this culture when we rethink these kinds of images, and when we recognize the vitally important role that decorative objects played in constructing the look, the experience, and the idea of cultivated ease. In March 1994, The New York Times published an article under the headline "Decoraphobia: When Bare is Better." It described a curious phenom- enon rampant among young, privileged, urban professionals: despite the extensive financial resources and stylistic options available to them for the decoration of their apartments, these individuals prefer to live in virtually empty spaces, white-painted boxes appointed only with the barest essentials. It often seems that despite post- modernism's celebrated rediscovery of such things as complexity, ornament, and plea- sure, our cultural sensibility is still informed by a distinctly modern ambivalence to- ward both decoration and delectation.56 In the elite social world of eighteenth-century France, however, rooms without decoration were rooms without meaning, and plea- sure was a crucial currency whose continuous exchange delineated the contours of social relationships. In this world, as Crebillon's sofa reminds us, "mere decoration" played a speaking part.

The extent of the similarity or differentiation of decorative art consumption among different social groups-and the cultural meanings of that consumption-is a vexed question that I will not attempt to take up here. For the purposes of this essay, I use the term "elite" (rather than "noble" or "aristocratic") to characterize broadly what was in fact a highly nuanced culture of privilege. Further study is needed to understand better how certain consumers might have used luxury consumption to refine, problematize, or even subvert the sign system of status. For evidence of the variety of individuals-including artists, collec- tors, financiers, foreigners, Madame de Pompadour, and Louis XV-who patronized the shop of the same luxury merchant, see Louis Courajod, ed., Livre-Journal de Lazare Duvaux, marchand-bijoutier ordinaire du roy (1873; reprint, Paris: F de Nobele, 1965), vol. 2.

Two recent studies begin to address the need for more contextual, theoretically engaged work: Katie Scott's richly documented The Rococo Interior argues strongly for the interdependence of decora- tion and ideology, but locates meaning primarily in the structures of production and in the figurative content of mural decoration (that is, painting) rather than in furniture or other decorative objects; Leora Auslander, Taste and Power: Furnishing Modern France (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1996) traces the political meanings of furniture from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century, but her treatment of the ancien regime tends to privilege makers over users, is informed by a somewhat simplistic conception of style, and seems to serve primarily as an introduction to and foil for postrevolutionary developments. For important considerations of the cultural meanings of French decorative art after the eighteenth cen- tury, see Debora L. Silverman, Art Nouveau in Fin-de-Siecle France: Politics, Psychology, and Style (Ber- keley: Univ. of California Press, 1989) and Nancy J. Troy, Modernism and the Decorative Arts in France: Art Nouveau to Le Corbusier (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1991). 6. The most extensive single project on the history of early modern consumption is a recent three- volume anthology published by Routledge; especially relevant to my project are John Brewer and Roy Porter, eds., Consumption and the World of Goods (1993) and John Brewer and Ann Bermingham, eds., The Consumption of Culture 1600-1800 (1995). A useful review of the literature on consumption can be found in Brewer and Porter's extensively noted introduction to the 1993 volume. Much of the research on eighteenth-century consumption focuses on England, generally identified as the birthplace of modern consumer culture; see Neil McKendrick, John Brewer, and J. H. Plumb, The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth-Century England (London: Europa, 1982). More work is needed to identify the practices and attitudes that characterized French conceptions of consumption; in addition to the political and economic structures of absolutism, factors worthy of further investigation include French attitudes toward artisanal practice, monetary exchange, and the role of individual taste and social interac- tion in the determination of cultural value. Other suggestive avenues of inquiry-although usually framed in terms of non-European or late modern subjects-are anthropological and sociological considerations of the role of object acquisition and display in the construction of social identity. See Arjun Appadurai, ed., The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986) and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton, The Meaning of Things: Domestic Symbols and the Self (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1981). Such studies, however, tend to be in-</page><page sequence="26">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 32 /4 formed by assumptions about the relationship between people and things that are problematic for the study of preindustrial culture. 7.

The classic survey of the eighteenth-century French interior-and still in many ways the most thought- ful, if not the most sumptuously produced-is Pierre Verlet, The Eighteenth Century in France: Society, Decoration, Furniture (Rutland, Vermont, and Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle, 1967). The three major catego- ries of furniture production were menuiserie (for solid wood objects, such as case furniture and chair frames), ebenisterie (for marquetry and exotic wood or lacquer veneers), and tapisserie (for upholstery).

"Quand une maison est batie, rien n'est fait encore; on n'est pas au quart de la depense; arrivent le menuisier, le tapissier, le peintre, le doreur, le sculpteur, l'eb6niste, etc. II faut ensuite des glaces et poser des sonnettes par-tout; le dedans occupe trois fois plus de tems que la construction de l'hotel; les anti-chambres, les escaliers derobes, les degagemens, les commodites, tout cela est a l'infini." A menuisier made carved wall panels and moldings as well as furniture. 10. An upholstered armchair with a carved and gilded frame, for example, was produced by a menuisier who built and carved the frame, a doreur who gilded it, and a tapissier who upholstered it with fabric woven at a textile manufactory. The more complex the object, the more complex the process of fabrica- tion; a fully accessorized dressing table, for example, veneered and bronze-mounted and fitted with a mirror and assorted objects of porcelain, lacquer, silver, and ivory, could easily require contributions from ten or more workshops, with specific steps performed by different workers within each workshop. The most vivid explication of this artisanal division of labor is the Encyclopedie of Diderot and d'Alembert (1751-77). For detailed discussions of both the guild system and exemptions from it, see Auslander, Taste and Power, 75-98, 110-39, and Scott, The Rococo Interior, 13-77. 11. Pairing examples of eighteenth-century French furniture with their elusive makers has been a pre- occupation of connoisseurs since the nineteenth century, but the use of stamps as evidence of authorship is problematic. Stamping was required only after 1743, it was not required of artisans granted royal exemp- tions, and its observance was sporadically enforced. Furthermore, it was performed more for legal reasons than as a claim of authorship on the part of the artisan, it is a more certain indication of a workshop than of an individual, and it was often placed in a location that was not visually accessible, which suggests to me that it was not central to the eighteenth-century consumer's conception of the significance or value of a piece. On stamping, see Jean-Dominique Augarde, "Histoire et signification de l'estampille des meubles," L'estampille 182 (June 1985): 52-58. 12. This opposition emerged in Renaissance discourses on art and was codified in France during the seventeenth century, when the foundation of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was based explicitly on a desire to distinguish the artist's enterprise from ignoble, guild-based artisanal fabrication. For an overview, see Nikolaus Pevsner, Academies of Art, Past and Present (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1940), 82-114. Selected documents that delineate the academic position are reproduced in Revue Universelle des Arts 3 (1856): 434-52 and 4 (1856): 144-57, 263-76. 13.

Louis-Sebastien Mercier, for example, characterized interaction in an English shop as minimal and pragmatic, whereas in France sociability diffused-and sometimes completely replaced-commerce: "Entrez dans une boutique a Paris: on vous fait asseoir, reverence reciproque, mille propos, en faisant le marche, meme jusqu'a vous entretenir d'affaires de famille, ou de nouvelles publiques; debat, grand d6bat, sur le marche...et I'on se separe souvent, apres beaucoup de dissertations, sans avoir rien fait" (Parallele de Paris et de Londres, ed. Claude Bruneteau and Bernard Cottret [Paris: Didier Erudition, 1982], 144). A well- known image that evokes the French luxury boutique as an arena for elite sociability is the "shop sign" painted by Antoine Watteau for the marchand-mercier Gersaint (Berlin, Schloss Charlottenburg). 15. The most extensive compilation of French furniture typologies is Nicole de Reynies, Le mobilier domestique, 2 vols. (Paris: L'Imprimerie Nationale, 1987).

(Paris: Quantin, 1887-89). On the vocabulary of furniture in the context of the eighteenth-century development of the French language, see Ferdinand Brunot, Histoire de la langue francaise des origines a 1900 (Paris: Armand Colin, 1932), 6:1090-1125. 16.

Car c'est principalement dans 1'Art de distribuer et disposer avec goft les differentes pieces d'un appartement que les Architectes de notre nation se sont distingues...il n'est aucun endroit dans le monde oiu les edifices soient distribues et decores interieurement avec tant d'elegance, de richesse et de commodite qu'ils le sont dans nos palais et nos grands hotels de Paris, aussi que dans les chateaux et les maisons de plaisance des environs." The term commodite is usually translated as "comfort" or (somewhat more accurately) "con- venience," but in eighteenth-century France it carried a more complex range of aesthetic and social nu- ance than any single English word can suggest; thus I prefer to leave it untranslated. 18.

Both the mural articulation and the furniture in this image, in which surfaces are defined primarily through the use of simple geometric shapes, straight lines, right angles, and architectural elements, exem- plify the neoclassical aesthetic that predominated in French interiors of the second half of the eighteenth century, compared to earlier rococo designs that emphasized curvilinear, atectonic forms. Such stylistic differences have traditionally been used to separate discussions of earlier and later eighteenth-century decoration; this essay focuses instead on characteristics that informed spaces and objects throughout the century. 21.

The toilette as a formal social practice combining ritualized dressing with the reception of visitors was codified at the French court during the seventeenth century by Anne of Austria and Louis XIV, and became widespread during the eighteenth century. Further investigation is needed to understand better the relationships between the gender and social status of both protagonist and audience, the diverse formal attributes of toilette ensembles, and the ways in which this ritual was performed and perceived. For an overview of the imagery of the toilette, see Elise Goodman-Soellner, "Boucher's 'Madame de Pompadour at her Toilette'," Simiolus 17 (1987): 41-58.

Austin, whose analysis of language as performance hinges on a conception of "how to do things with words." 29.

See Roubo, L'Art du menuisier en meubles, 609, 614, 637-38. 31. This is vividly expressed by the instructions to ladies for graceful sitting and rising offered by le chevalier de Londeau: "Elle s'approchera du fauteuil qu'on lui presentera, elle placera ses deux talons vis- a-vis l'un de l'autre a trois ou quatre pouces de distance; elle pliera un peu les genoux au moment de s'asseoir en baissant les epaules et en avangant sa poitrine, elle evitera sur-tout le fond et le bord du fauteuil, parce que l'attitude trop au fond ou trop au bord du fauteuil s'opposeroit ia la facilite de se relever, et meme au bon Maintien de tout le corps...Pour se lever avec la meme grace, il faut couler un peu les deux pieds sous soi en les approchant du fauteuil, pour prendre de la force, et eviter les apparences d'un mouvement trop marque; en se preparant ainsi, il faut baisser egalement les epaules en avancant la poitrine, etre ferme des hanches et se lever le corps ferme.

On switching seats during visiting, see Mercier, Tableau de Paris, 4:44-45. For a criticism of the visitor who does not circulate but remains installed in a single chair, see Jean-Baptiste Morvan de Bellegarde, Reflexions sur le ridicule, et sur les moyens de l'eviter (1696), in Oeuvres diverses de M. I'abbe de Bellegarde (Paris: Claude Robustel, 1723), 1:56. 33. See Mark Wigley, "Prosthetic Theory: the Disciplining of Architecture," Assemblage 15 (August 1991): 7-9. Wigley uses this concept, borrowed from the writings of Le Corbusier, to trace corporeal and architectural preoccupations that he views as uniquely modernist; this position, I believe, needs reconsid- eration. 34. On the refiguration of the body by clothing, see Alicia Annas, "The Elegant Art of Movement," in An Elegant Art: Fashion and Fantasy in the Eighteenth Century, ed. Edward Maeder (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1983), 35-58. On clothing in general, see Aileen Ribeiro, The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France, 1750-1820 (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1995); and Daniel Roche, La Culture des apparences. Une histoire du vetement XVIIe-XVIIIe siecle (Paris: Fayard, 1989). The interconnection between furniture and bodily decoration is further suggested by the interchangeable use during the eigh-</page><page sequence="29">HELLMAN / Furniture, Sociability, and Leisure 443 teenth century of the terms meubles (furniture) and bijoux (jewelry) to describe both objects for the interior and personal accessories. Many marchands-merciers sold combinations of spatial and bodily adorn- ments, displaying their array of specialized tables and chairs together with items such as fans, snuffboxes, and walking sticks. 35. The secondary literature on the practices and cultural meanings of politeness in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is excellent and too large to cite here. The classic study is Maurice Magendie, La Politesse mondaine et les theories de l'honnetete en France au XVIIe siecle, 2 vols. (Paris: Felix Alcan, 1925). Two important recent studies are Daniel Gordon, Citizens Without Sovereignty: Equality and Sociability in French Thought, 1670-1789 (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1994) and Lawrence E. Klein, Shaftesbury and the Culture of Politeness: Moral Discourse and Cultural Politics in Early Eigh- teenth-Century England (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1994). See also Dena Goodman's discussion of salon conduct and the persona of the salonniere in The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1994), 99-119. "Politeness" was a complex concept that incorporated differing-and even contradictory-meanings in different social, political, intellectual, and national contexts; Gordon notes the association between politeness and Frenchness (Citizens without Sovereignty, 75-76) and provides a useful survey of "varieties of civility" in France in arenas ranging from the court to the salons (Citizens without Sovereignty, 86-128). For the purposes of this essay, I use the term "polite" to characterize broadly the aesthetic of mondanite (urbane worldliness), a widely practiced mode of elite conduct that was neither as hierarchical and formulaic as official court etiquette nor as radically unmediated as the supposedly more "natural" behavior advocated by social critics like Jean- Jacques Rousseau. 36. Caraccioli, Paris, le modele des nations etrangeres, 84. "II n'est pas donne a tous les hommes d'avoir cet esprit liant et facile, qui gagne la confiance, et qui plait dans tous les pays...Les Europeens, presque tous sur la reserve, ne sont devenus communicatifs, que depuis qu'ils prirent les manieres Frangaises." Some authors even asserted that to be French and ill-mannered was fundamentally unpatri- otic; see Charles-Francois-Nicolas Le Maitre de Claville, Traite du vrai merite de l'homme considere dans tous les ages et dans toutes les conditions, avec des principes d'education propres a former les jeunes gens a la vertu (Paris: Saugrain, 1736), 141-42. 37. Bellegarde, Reflexions sur le ridicule, 8-9. "La politesse est un assemblage de discretion, de civilite, de complaisance, de circonspection, et d'une modestie accompagnee d'un air agreable, qui se repand sur tout ce que l'on dit et sur tout ce que l'on fait." See also Bellegarde, Reflexions sur la politesse des moeurs (1696), in Oeuvres diverses, vol. 2. 38. The following summary of the attributes of the polite individual is based on a variety of eighteenth- century texts, some of which are editions of seventeenth-century works. As Roger Chartier has noted, writings on manners were increasingly directed not at established elites, but at less privileged readers who sought to acquire the behavioral signifiers of status. However, because they so clearly outline the basic rules of cultivated conduct, I use them here to highlight the qualities that were both required for and reinforced by individuals' encounters with furniture. See Roger Chartier, "From Text to Manners, A Con- cept and its Books: Civilite between Aristocratic Distinction and Popular Appropriation," in The Cultural Uses of Print in Early Modern France, trans.

A highly detailed account of the aesthetics and mechanics of bodily deportment is Londeau, Traite de maintien du corps. The body also signified through the way its surface looked as a surface, through attributes and meanings of clothing, makeup, and hairstyle that I do not have room to examine here.

A duchesse was a type of day bed, a marquise was an extra-wide chair, and a bergere (shepherdess) was a chair with upholstered sides. In the case of voyeuse and veilleuse (another kind of day bed), femi- nine suffixes added to the stems of verbs related to vision (voir, to see; veiller, to watch) result in words that not only invoke the acts of spectatorship for which the pieces were used, but in fact make the objects themselves (literally, "seer" and "watcher") seem like spectators. 50. It is perhaps worth noting as well-though anthropomorphically named parts are not unique to French furniture-that objects also have corps (bodies), jambes (legs), pieds (feet), and even joues (cheeks, a reference to the upholstered sides of a chair). 51. Bellegarde, Reflexions sur le ridicule, 35. "Le moien le plus stir pour s'emparer des esprits, et pour engager les gens a nous rendre de bons offices, est de les prevenir par des manieres douces et insinuantes, par des complaisances et par des assiduitez: Au contraire les duretez, I'impolitesse, les brusqueries les aigrissent, et les obligent quelquefois a se declarer contre nous, quelque bonne intention qu'ils aient de nous servir." 52. Formulations of the idea that delightfully conveyed knowledge was a singularly French preoccupa- tion can be found in many writings on art, literature, philosophy, manners, education, and taste. A repre- sentative example is Louis-Antoine Caraccioli, De la gaiete (Frankfurt and Paris: Nyon, 1762), 120-21.
