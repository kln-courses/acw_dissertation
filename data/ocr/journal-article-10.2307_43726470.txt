<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lost in Translation: Did It Matter If Christians "Thanked" God or "Gave God Glory"? JEROME H. NEYREY, S.J. University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, IN 46556 The meaning of words resides in the cultural use of them, not in léxica. Moreover, the greater the chronological distance between the culture of the NT and ours, the more likely the meanings of words will be "lost in translation." The word eùxaptOTelv is a case in point. This verb is universally understood now as "to give thanks," a meaning not common in antiquity. Much is lost in translation if we do not examine this word in its cultural setting, comparing and contrasting it with formal expressions of "praise." Moreover, by "giving thanks" are mortals recip- rocating for favors received from the Immortal One? Is a debt being resolved? "Thanks-giving," finally, is by no means found in all cultures.1 This article is the presidential address delivered at the Seventy-first International Meeting of the Catholic Biblical Association of America, held at Fordham University, Bronx, New York, August 2-5, 2008. 1 Some cultures have no concept of or terms for giving thanks, while in other cultures it is a social faux pas to say "thanks." So an Arab proverb states: "Do not thank me, you will repay me." In India, there exists no expression for "thanks" because beneficial social acts toward another are viewed as the fulfillment of an obligation. If someone gives a gift, the recipient believes that the gift is the result of a previous obligation and therefore is deserved; balanced reciprocity operates. See John J. Pilch, "No Thank You!" TBT 40 (2002) 49-53; H. S. Versnel, "Religious Mentality in Ancient Prayer," in Faith, Hope and Worship: Aspects of Religious Mentality in the Ancient World (ed. H. S. Versnel; Studies in Greek and Roman Religion 2; Leiden: Brill, 1981) 1-64; and Theodor Scher- mann, "Eúxapicrría und EÙxapiatéto in ihrem Bedeutungswandel bis 200 n. Chr.," Philologus 69 (1910) 376. Claus Westermann ( The Praise of God in the Psalms [Richmond: John Knox, 1965] 27) said: "It is clear that the O.T. does not have our independent concept of thanks. The expression of thanks to God is included in praise." 1</page><page sequence="2">2 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 The Greek verb that was eventually interpreted as "to give thanks" became current only in the late Hellenistic period, and then basically in Asia Minor.2 Orig- inally it served as a synonym of "praise."3 As we shall see, recipients of favors in the ancient world understood that the required return was "praise," not "thanks."4 Even in liturgical prayers in the early church, the meaning of £t&gt;xapi&lt;rreiv only slowly metamorphosed into "to express gratitude." But the ancients knew that "praise" was quite a different phenomenon from "giving thanks" or "expressing gratitude." Something gets lost in translation because modern notions of "giving thanks" lack appreciation of "praise," "honor," and "glory," which are the proper cultural context for interpreting even euxcipiaTEtv. In modern usage, subjective "thanks- giving" tends to swallow expressions of public respect and "praise," and it can even assume the importance of being the preferred way of responding to God. This likely results in part from the dominance that the term Eucharist assumed as a metaphor for worship and liturgy. But just the opposite is true in Greek, where "praise" was the genus whose species include honor, glorify, extol, magnify, and so on. Consider the following doxology: Āļiiļv, rļ suXoyia Kai rļ ôóÇa Kai iļ aocpía Kai r| £i&gt;xaPl(ma Kai f| Tīļir) Kai rļ ôi)va(iic; Kai f| taxùç tõ&gt; 0£&lt;ï) rļļiarv elq toùç aidrvaç r a&gt;v alcovcov- aļitļv. Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen. (Rev 7: 12)5 Eúxapiatía is but one of many hues of praise on this palette, and by no means the most significant one. It functions as another item in the sematic word field of "praise," along with "bless," "glorify," and "honor." This distinction tends to be lost in modern translations. Since "to give thanks" is often an infelicitous translation of euxapiatelv in the NT, our task is to learn how to interpret it in terms of its appropriate cultural 2 Robert J. Ledogar (Acknowledgment: Praise-verbs in the Early Greek Anaphora [Rome: Herder, 1968] 105) noted, "The words eùxapicrreïv, EÙxapicrria, eùxâpioToc; do not enter Biblical lit- erature as praise words at all until the first century B.C." 3 George Henry Boobyer ( " Thanksgiving " and the " Glory of God" in Paul [Borna/Leipzig: Robert Noske, 1929] 1-6) is just one of many scholars who consider eùxcipiOTEÎv to be a synonym of verbs such as èÇojioXoYeíaOe, aivelv, ÔoÇáÇeiv, eùXoyeîv, and ūļivelv. See Ledogar, Acknowledg- ment, 57. 4 B. Jacob ("Beiträge zu einer Einleitung in die Psalmen," ZAW 17 [1897] 263-79, here 276) noted: "It is very questionable whether tõdãh ever means thanks, but rather it always means praise, recognition, confession." 5 In the following references one can readily see how interchangeable are "praise," "glory," and "honor," and they frequently appear together: Rom 2:7, 10; Eph 1 : 12, 14; Phil 1 : 1 1 ; 1 Tim 1:17; 6:16; Heb 2:7; 1 Pet 1:7; 2 Pet 1:17; Rev 4:9, 11; 5:12-13; 7:12; 21:6. Not only are "honor" and "praise" sought after by mortals, but they are the unique response to God.</page><page sequence="3">LOST IN TRANSLATION 3 scenario in the ancient world, which consists of three items. First, we must inter- pret £i&gt;xapiaT8lv in terms of "praise" and "honor," the basic cultural values in antiq- uity, which are expressed in the epideictic rhetoric of praise and blame. Honor and praise were the typical ways of acknowledging a person's worth, not so ev'a- piarelv. Because of the dominance of honor and praise, we recognize that the palette of praise contains many synonyms such as "to honor," "to glorify," "to bless," "to extol," and "to acknowledge," but only occasionally is euxapiatelv found with them. For example, Robert J. Ledogar demonstrated this in his survey of "praise- verbs" in the early Greek anaphora. He constantly used the term "lan- guage of praise" to show how interchangeable these verbs are.6 Second, we must examine the phenomena of benefaction and praise, and so consider patron-client relationships between the Immortal One and mortals. Third, we must question whether any reciprocity is expected when benefaction is received. Is there an obli- gation to give anything back to God? These considerations constitute the essential elements of an adequate native scenario for interpreting eùxapiatelv in its culture, rather than in ours. I. Is There a Problem Needing to Be Solved? A. Lost in Translation : Luke 17:11-19 The story of the ten lepers healed by Jesus illustrates the translation problem. Although Jesus sends all of them to the priests for certification of cleanness, only one returns to Jesus "giving glory to God (ôoÇáÇcov tòv 0eóv) with a loud voice" (v. 15). Then he falls at Jesus' feet, ev&gt;xapicrr(I)v avrCb. Jesus comments, "Was no one found to return and give thanks to God (ôouvai ôóÇav rep 0ecp) except this for- eigner?" (v. 18). There is a problem in the RSV translation of this because some- thing significant is lost. Most translations render ôoûvai ôóÇav as "praise"; rarely is it translated as "glorifying" God, with "a loud voice," no less. But because we operate out of an ancient cultural notion of praise and honor, "praise" is an admis- sible synonym, so little is lost in translation. Similarly, translators prefer "praise" to the original "give glory" - again acceptable. But the RSV renders "give glory" in v. 18 by "give thanks," which is an infelicitous rendering of "glory" (or "praise").7 The entire native scenario of "praise" and "honor" is absent. Here and 6 Ledogar {Acknowledgment, 63-88) begins his study of the language of praise in the LXX with a desire to learn what the diverse words of praise have in common; he discovers how inter- changeable they are. The common denominator of all of them is "a public proclamatory character of the praise act" (p. 74). For example, considering ôoÇáÇeiv, he concludes "'Give honor to,' 'ren- der public homage to' remains by far the most frequent Septuagint meaning of ôoÇáÇeiv" (p. 78). 7 This translation error is not exclusive to the RSV; the New Century Version and the Con- temporary English Version, among others, translate the verb in Luke 17: 1 8 as "thank," not "praise" or "give glory to."</page><page sequence="4">4 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71, 2009 elsewhere, Luke regularly indicates that the proper reaction to divine benefaction is to "give glory to God" (ôoÇá(o)v tòv 0eóv). For example, "He received his sight and followed him, glorifying (SoÇáÇojv) God; and all the people when they saw it, gave praise (aivov) to God" (18:43; see 5:25-26; 13:13). In none of these instances do those cured "thank" God, but rather they publicly "praise" and "glorify" God as benefactor. But what of the leper's response to Jesus: eùxapiatcDv autā)? It is sandwiched between two references to "giving glory" to God, which inclines us to render it here as a synonym of praise. Moreover, since nowhere else in Luke is God or Jesus "thanked," this fact further inclines us to render it as "praise." B. Lost in Translation: Tobit 12:6 The problem complexifies when translators replace words clearly from the semantic field of "praise" with "thanks." Something is surely being lost in trans- lation when, for example, we read the RSV rendering of the angel's instructions to Tobit and his son on how to pray. Praise God and give thanks to him; exalt him and give thanks to him It is good to praise God and to exalt his name, worthily declaring the works of God. Do not be slow to give him thanks. (Tob 12:6 RSV) EuXoyelte tòv 0eòv Kal aÚTã) £Ço1ioXoy£îa0£, (i£yaXa)ai&gt;vr|v ôíôote aurā) Kal èÇo(ioXoYeIa0e èvámiov tuxvtídv tõ&gt;v Çcòvtojv 7tepl &lt;í&gt;v £7toír|aev ļi£0' ūļiarv- àya0òv tò £ÙXoyeîv tòv 0£Òv Kal û'1/oûv tò ovovia aÙToO, toùç Xóyoix; Ttov ëpycuv TOÖ 0£OŪ £VTÍ(IÜ)&lt;; Ú7IOÔ£lKVÚOVT£Ç, Kal ļif) ÒKV£ÍT£ £^oļio'oy£la0ai aÙTCÌ). Without the Greek text, one would think that this is a "thanksgiving prayer" because of the triple repetition of "give thanks." But the translator thrice mis- translates the language of "praise" into "thanks": "give thanks to him (èÇofioXo- yeíaOe) . . . give thanks to him (¿^ofioXoyelaOE) . . . give him thanks (¿^oļioXoy8ia0ai)." But there are no words here for "giving thanks," none at all. Something is being lost in this translation.8 If "giving thanks" is totally absent, then what is the prayer's purpose? Tobit and son are instructed to "praise" God in the traditional way of piling up syno- nyms.9 The first term, "bless" (euXoyeiTe tòv 0eòv), is properly rendered as 8 It has long been observed that, in the canonical books of the LXX, euxapiaxelv is not found: "The Hebrew language, like Aramaic, had no word that properly signified 'to thank'" (Ledogar, Acknowledgment, 100). Instead one finds verbs indicating praise in some form: (è7i)aiv£ív, èÇopoXoyelaOe, eùXoyelv, ÔoÇáÇeiv, uļiveīv. It appears that when translating into Greek, the transla- tors of the Bible considered èÇopoXoyeïaÔe to be best suited to render the hiphil of TP and aiveiv for the piel ofV?n. 9 The Greeks even had a name for the amassing of titles and names of honor, 7Toauü) vuoila. Dio Chrysostom states: "The statue is in keeping with all the titles by which Zeus is known. For he alone</page><page sequence="5">LOST IN TRANSLATION 5 "praise." "Acknowledge" (èÇo^oXoyelaOe) is another alternative for "praise." Ordi- narily one might accept "exalt" as a synonym, except that here it waters down "give God majesty " ([ieyaXioairvriv ôîôote), a more dramatic expression of praise. "Acknowledgment" (e^oiioXoyelaSe) appears again, meaning "praise." The state- ment "it is good to praise God and exalt his name" is correct on "praise" (eùXoyeïv rov 0£Òv), but weak on "exalt his name" (ú'|/oüv tò övo^a airroö), for it hides the public character of praise: "to sing a song in cultic setting." " Worthily declaring the works of God" accurately renders the adverb "honorably" (èvTÍfiax;), and the verb "to call attention to" (ímoôeucvúovTeç) expresses "praise." When all of the verbs are correctly understood in terms of "praise," nothing is lost in translation, because all of the verbs in this prayer belong to the semantic word field of praise and honor. The triple substitution of "giving thanks" for "praise" is infelicitous because it does not recognize the native value scenario of praise and honor, and promotes another expression, "give thanks," to prominence. Much indeed is lost in such a translation. C. Found in Translation: Understanding Language In a series of studies, Bruce J. Malina provides the theory for my reading.10 Drawing on studies from sociolinguistics and reading theory, Malina brings to the task of interpreting the NT certain tested insights from reading theory. He makes two significant points: (1) Meaning derives from a social system, not léxica; and (2) reading, to be accurate, must employ culturally appropriate scenarios from that system. First, the meanings people share are rooted in and derive from a social sys- tem. By this is meant (1) knowing the culture, "the accepted ways of interpreting the world and everything in it," and (2) understanding a culture's social structures, "the accepted ways of marrying, having children, working, governing, worshiping and understanding God, and of being a person."11 To be sure, the NT's way of of the gods is entitled 'Father and King,' 'Protector of Cities,' 'God of Friendship,' 'God of Com- radeship,' and also 'Protector of Suppliants,' 'God of Hospitality,' 'Giver of Increase'" (Or. 12.75). Little Artemis sat on her father's lap and asked for a special gift, "Give me many-namedness (7to'uo)vu|iir|v)"; cited by J. M. Bremer," Greek Hymns," in Faith, Hope and Worship (ed. Versnel), 193-215. 10 Bruce J. Malina, "Reading Theory Perspective," in The Social World of Luke- Acts: Models for Interpretation (ed. Jerome H. Neyrey; Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1991) 3-24; and idem, "Inter- pretation: Reading, Abduction, Metaphor," in The Bible and Politics of Exegesis: Essays in Honor of Norman K.

Malina proposes that NT readers adopt "the scenario model," which presupposes that readers have a full and verifiable grasp of how the ancient world works, which they bring to the task of reading. Considerate authors attempt to accommodate their readers by beginning with what readers know and joining it to new, unknown features to be imparted. Considerate read- ers, on the other hand, share already or attempt to share the author's social system and hence scenarios. The problem for modern readers is that not only do they not know the social system of the ŅT world, but they do not know that they do not know it. Hence, they tend to bring to their reading ethnocentric scenarios to inter- pret that ancient world and to think that they are correctly interpreting ancient texts and documents. Considerate readers, then, will approach both the English term "to give thanks" and the Greek one euxapiatelv with suspicion that they might not have equivalent meaning. The social dynamic in antiquity that expressed human responses to the favors of the deity is utterly different from our custom of prayers of thanksgiving. II. Considerate Reading: Learning the Social System Because we take seriously the remarks of linguists on language and reading, we must ask what the social system behind Luke and Tobit was like. What mental pictures of the way their world worked do we need to know to be considerate read- ers? Ideally we would consider three foundational concepts for an adequate sce- nario: (1) patron-client relations between God and mortals; (2) types of reciprocity, to learn if gifts come with strings attached; and (3) appreciation of the paramount value of praise/honor. Appreciation of the cultural value of honor/praise is far and away the most important of these three, so I will concentrate on it and treat the other two briefly in passing, since they are so well known in modern scholarship.12 Since the work of Marshall D. Sahlins, scholars have distinguished three types of reciprocity: generalized, balanced, and negative.13 It is best to consider them as a continuum of reciprocity. At one extreme, the solidarity extreme, is generalized reciprocity (give, do not get), while at the other end, the unsocial extreme, is neg- can families have changed such that men do chores traditionally viewed as belonging to women (cooking, child care) and women work outside the home at jobs traditionally held by men. 12 On benefactor-client relations, see Jerome H. Neyrey, "God, Benefactor and Patron: The Major Cultural Model for Interpreting the Deity in the Greco-Roman World," JSNT 27 (2005) 465- 92. On reciprocity, see Hans van Wees, "The Law of Gratitude: Reciprocity in Anthropological The- ory," in Reciprocity in Ancient Greece (ed. Christopher Gill, Norman Postlethwaite, and Richard Seaford; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998) 13-50. 13 Marshall D. Sahlins, Stone Age Economics (Chicago: Aldine Atherton, 1972) 188-96.</page><page sequence="7">LOST IN TRANSLATION 7 ative reciprocity {get, do not give). In the center is balanced reciprocity (give and get). In patron-client relations between gods and mortals, only generalized and balanced reciprocity concern us. Sahlins's model of reciprocity, moreover, has been successfully used in the analysis of Greek materials,14 of the Hebrew Bible,15 and of early Christianity.16 1 . characteristic: give without expectation of return GENERALIZED 2. forms: child rearing, care of elders reciprocity 3. recipients : parents, children, kin 4. biblical examples: Matt 7:11; Luke 10:33-35 1 . characteristic : tit-for-tat, quid-pro-quo BALANCED 2. forms: barter, assistance agreements, marriage arrangements17 reciprocity 3. recipients: neighbors 4. biblical examples: 1 Cor 9:3-12; Matt 10:10; Luke 10:7 Our interest in reciprocity theory will guide us when we consider what kinds of transactions are occurring when mortals petition or praise the deity, and what debt mortals might incur when they become recipients of divine benefaction. Hardly an abstract question! Was the ancient world even concerned with reciprocity? Is this an inconsid- erate reading of those individuals? Indeed, they understood it and discussed it often. Most discourse on return or recognition of benefaction utilized the term ct^ioißr), which could simply mean the wage that is the proper recompense for labor (Philo Spec. 4.195). Philo used this term also to describe the machinations of a man who gives for the sole purpose of receiving a return of praise: "The givers are seeking the honor and praise as their exchange and look for the repayment of the benefit (a|ioißi1v)" ( Cher. 122), unlike God, who seeks no return ( Cher. 123). But note that "honor and praise" are typical responses to benefaction. Philo himself is clear that humankind cannot and should not make a return to God for the bene- faction of creation: "The work most appropriate to God is conferring benefaction 14 Van Wees, "Law of Gratitude"; Walter Dolan, "Reciprocities in Homer," Classical World 72 (1981) 137-75; and idem, "The Unequal Exchange between Glaucus and Diomedes in Light of the Homeric Gift-Economy," Phoenix 43 (1989) 1-15. 15 Gary Stansell, "The Gift in Ancient Israel," Semeia 87 (2006) 65-90. 16 Bruce J.

Philo regularly uses a|ioißr| to describe the response of people to someone who has ben- efitted them {Mos. 1.58; Joseph 267). But this return (ctļioiprļ) is no "thing," but "honor." Although Philo is but one of many persons discussing exchange/return between God and mortals, his remarks on a[ioißr| indicate that this was a formal topic, a genuine part of his scenario, and representative of other conversations about it. Indeed, God acts with generalized reciprocity to mortals. But the response to God is mostly praise and sometimes a balanced return. A. (t Praise "/" Honor Pivotal Values in Antiquity I take it as proven that honor and praise are pivotal values in the ancient world. To the Greeks, pursuit of honor was the unparalleled motive for action: "Atheni- ans excel all others not so much in singing or in stature or in strength, as in love of honour (&lt;piXoTi|iia), which is the strongest incentive to deeds of honour and renown" (Xenophon Mem. 3.3. 13). 18 Centuries later, Augustine commented on the Roman obsession with praise and renown: "He [God] granted supremacy to men who for the sake of honor, praise and glory served the country in which they were seeking their own glory" {Civ. 5.13). Authors from classical Greece to the late Roman Empire agree on the desirability and centrality of honor. In fact, Paul cel- ebrates the person whose life is dedicated to the pursuit of "honor and glory": "To those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life . . . but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good" (Rom 2:7, 10). The pursuit of it is rewarded with it. When one examines the semantic word field of "praise," one sees clearly how different it is from that of "thanks." Eugene A. Nida and Johannes P. Louw inter- pret words in terms of their semantic domains, and their insights are particularly valuable here. "To praise," which means to publicize the excellence of someone, may be expressed just as well by "to bless," "to glorify," "to magnify," and "to acknowledge," and by nouns such as a "report" spreading about Jesus (Luke 4:14) or a "word" circulating about him (Luke 5:15; 7:17).19 "To thank," on the other hand, refers to an interior feeling that may be expressed as gratitude for something 18 Love of honor, Xenophon said, distinguishes humans from beasts: "In this man differs from other animals - I mean, in this craving for honour. In meat and drink and sleep and sex all creatures alike seem to take pleasure; but love of honour (cpiXoTifiia) is rooted neither in the brute beasts nor in every human being. But they in whom is implanted a passion for honour and praise, these are they who differ most from the beasts of the field, these are accounted men and not mere human beings" (Hier. 7.3). 19 Johannes P. Louw and Eugene A. Nida, Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament Based on Semantic Domains (2nd ed.; New York: United Bible Societies, 1989) 33.354-64.</page><page sequence="9">LOST IN TRANSLATION 9 done for someone.20 Curiously, unlike "praise" and its synonyms, according to Nida and Louw, "to thank" has no cognates or synonyms. Moreover, one might ask, What are the specific nuances of the synonyms of "praise"? What shades of meaning does each have? ('E7t)aiv£îv (BDAG, 357; TDNT 1. 177): to express one's admiration for or approval of a person; praise , approval , recognition : "for the glory and praise of God" (Phil 1:11). ôoÇáÇeiv (BDAG, 257; TDNT 2. 237-53): to influence opinion about another so as to enhance another's reputation; praise, honor, and extol: "give glory to God" (Luke 17:15). èÇonoXoyeíaOcu (BDAG, 708; TDNT 5. 199-215): to acknowledge something in public; acknowledge, profess, praise: ". . . every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" (Phil 2:11). euXoyelv (BDAG, 407-8; TDNT 2. 753): to say something commendatory; to speak well of; praise, extol: "He began to speak, praising God" (Luke 1 :64). tīļiāv (BDAG, 1004-5; TDNT&amp;. 169-80): to set a price on, estimate values of; to show high regard for; honor, revere: ". . . all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father" (John 5:23). u^velv (BDAG, 1027; TDNTS. 489-503): to sing a song in a cultic setting; to sing the praise of: "When they had sung the hymn, they went out" (Mark 14:26). All of these words belong to the semantic domain of "praise," sharing in common a sense of acknowledging worth or awarding public praise and honor for excel- lence. Each, of course, has its own nuance: aivelv expresses admiration and approval; ôoÇáÇeiv attempts to enhance reputation, that is, to bring others to hold the same good idea about someone (2 Cor 4:15; Eph 1:6, 12, 14; 1 Pet 1:7); èÇo(io'oYeIa0ai means publicly to acknowledge someone's worthiness; eùXoyeïv expresses verbal efforts to speak in praise of someone or about him or her; tijiav attests to another's worth, excellence, or importance; and u^ivetv expresses praise, especially in a public setting. What, then, of euxapiareiv? What nuance does it have? euxapiatelv (BDAG, 415-16; TDNT 2. 762): to show that one is under obli- gation to be thankful, to feel obligated to thank; to express appreciation for benefits or blessings; give, render, express thanks. When euxapiarelv appears in a string of words of "praise," it takes on the color- ing of its mates. But on its own as an independent term it does not mean the expres- 20 Ibid., 33.349-53; 25.99-101.</page><page sequence="10">10 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 sion of public worth, honor, or value. Rather, as an interior feeling, it indicates the debt of gratitude for a benefaction given. At the risk of exaggerating the differ- ences between "praise" and "thanks," I cite the comparison made by Claus West- ermann:21 1 . The one praised is elevated; one's 1 . The one thanked remains in place. glory increases by causing others to recognize one's qualities. 2. Praise is directed entirely toward 2. In thanking I express my thanks. 3. Spontaneous exuberance is the core 3. Giving thanks fulfills a duty or of praise; it is joyful. obligation; it is something required. 4. Praise is exclusively public; it is 4. Giving thanks is first private, of no intended to lead others to praise. concern to anyone except those giving thanks and the one being thanked. 5. Praise can never be commanded. 5. Thanks is often a debt or obligation to be fulfilled. Public versus private; extolling virtues and accomplishments versus feeling grat- itude; propaganda for the one praised versus gratitude to a donor - they are intrin- sically different. To sharpen this distinction, I examine the following situations where euxapiarelv would be a culturally unsatisfactory response. Speaking of Philip of Macedonia, Demosthenes said: "Glory is his sole object and ambition; in action and in danger he has elected to suffer whatever may befall him, putting before a life of safety the distinction of achieving what no other king of Macedonia ever achieved" ( 20lynth . 2.15). "Almost everywhere in Greece it is deemed a high hon- our to be proclaimed victor at Olympia" (Cornelius Nepos Preface Great Gener- als of Foreign Nations 7). Finally, those criticized in Matthew seek honor, not gratitude: "And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others" (Matt 6:5; see 23:5-7). Because translators of the biblical texts noted above are not sufficiently appre- ciative of the importance of praise and honor in antiquity, their scenario is deficient on this point. They seem ignorant not only about "praise" (and "honor") but about Aristotle's third type of rhetoric, epideictic. Rhetoricians for centuries provided elaborate rules on how to praise and where to find grounds for praise. To "praise" 21 Westermann, Praise of God in the Psalms, 27. Ledogar {Acknowledgment, 95) says: "We have seen how the verbs aivelv, eùXoyeïv, èÇo|ioA.OYeïa0ai, etc. signify fundamentally a public act of making known the virtues or deeds of another. . . . The verb eùxapiatelv on the contrary is prima- rily an expression of an interior sentiment and only consequently a verb of praise."</page><page sequence="11">LOST IN TRANSLATION 1 1 someone means to honor one, exalt one's name, glorify one, tell aloud one's aperiļ, increase one's fame, acknowledge one's worth, and make much of one. So says Aristotle: Honor is a sign of a reputation for doing good, and benefactors, above all, are justly honored. . . . The components of honor are sacrifices [made to the benefactor after death], memorial inscriptions, receipt of special awards, grant of land, front seats at festivals, burial at public expense, statues, free food in the state dining room and rites of precedence. (Rhet. 1.5.8) I am concerned here to establish the importance of "praise" and "honor" as essen- tial elements of the cultural scenario of Luke.22 Honor and praise are the typical ways of acknowledging a person's worth, not euxapiaxelv. When we compare the reactions cited by Luke in regard to God's benefaction, we never find "give thanks" (see chart on p. 12). "Honor" befits both God and Jesus. What conclusions might we draw from this? No one in Luke ever "thanks" God, but rather extends public "glory," "praise," and acknowledgment of worth, which is the appropriate cultural response to benefaction. Jesus likewise operates in the world of honor and praise, inasmuch as his reputation (i.e., honor) keeps spreading abroad (Luke 5: 15; 7: 17). In 13: 17, even as his opponents are "shamed," he is correspondingly "honored," because the crowds acknowledge his status as a "prophet." But in none of these instances does anyone "thank" him or God, except perhaps in 17:16. These data suggest that only "glory," "praise," and acknowl- edgment of honor are the appropriate responses to both God and Jesus. Because the complete response to God and Jesus is "praise" and "honor," I am persuaded to understand eùxapiaxcov in 17: 16 in terms of public praise, not as private gratitude. All here is "praise." III. Greek Prayer: Praise, Not Thanks J. H. Quincey After studying phrases in Greek drama thought to convey "thanks," Quincey remarks: "If we ask the lexicon the question what was the Greek for 'Thank you,' it will supply us with one verb aivelv [to praise]."23 He talks also about the obli- gation created by receiving a gift and how this is requited. "Greeks saw an obli- gation created by a favor received and sought to discharge it. Since praise was a 22 Not all responses were honor and praise. Versnel ("Religious Mentality in Ancient Prayer," 56-57) describes the commercium quality of benefaction and response: "Man gave and the god had to answer with another gift and vice versa. The commercial nature of the transaction was often pro- saically expressed by calling the favour returned a 'debt' which had to be 'paid.'" As he notes, Apollos demanded his misthos for his oracles, as did Asclepius for cures. See Cicero Off. 1.15.47. 23 J. H.

He contrasts English and Greek responses to benefaction. "The Englishman," he notes, "is content to express his feelings26 ... the Greeks saw an obligation and sought to discharge it," thus rec- ognizing our translation problem: "The difference between their usage and ours is not just a verbal one but reflects a fundamental difference of outlook."27 24 Ibid., 157. 25 Ibid. Quincey cites Plato on this point: Socrates is speaking: "In saying that I do not pay thanks you are mistaken. I pay as much as I am able. And I am able only to bestow praise. For money I lack. But I praise right willingly those who appear to speak well" (Resp. 1.338b). 26 The interior character of "thanks-giving" is evident in the choice of the word "thank" to translate the Greek term. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the root meanings of "thanks- giving" are (1) "thought" (from thanken, Old German danken, and then denken ), (2) favorable thought, and (3) kindly thought toward someone for favors received. Strictly a private affair. 27 Quincey, "Greek Expressions of Thanks," 157.</page><page sequence="13">LOST IN TRANSLATION 1 3 H. S. Versnel In his study of Greek prayer, Versnel notes the surprising scarcity of prayers of gratitude. "True words of thanks are seldom or never to be met with in these inscriptions ... for the Greek archaic period we do not have a single example of an unequivocal word of thanks."28 He concentrates, then, on inscriptions in which he notes the relationship of etyapurru) and ev&gt;xapiaToi)(iev with ancient votive offerings, observing that they appear only in the late Hellenistic period and pri- marily in Asia Minor. Alternately, Versnel examines the way in which Greeks closer to the world of Jesus and Paul made a response for favors received. As he discusses xápiç, he takes seriously the suggestion of Theophrastus that sacrifice is offered to the gods to honor them (ôià Ttfidv), to show appreciation to them (Sta Xápiv), and to petition them (ôià xpeíciv). He argues, moreover, that "there is no compelling reason to read the element of 'thanks' into the term x&lt;*PK - for the return service."29 Versnel concludes that the ancients expressed praise, not thanks. "The term with which the Greek of the classical period expressed his gratitude is not so much a word of the family of x&lt;*pię, as above all (eTr)aivoc;, £7taiveīv."30 Praise meant the acknowledgment and honoring of someone. Theophrastus, then, was correct that sacrifice and prayer are offered first for the sake of honor (praise). Jan Maarten Bremer Bremer begins his study of giving and thanksgiving by citing Euthydemos, a conversation partner of Socrates: "I am discouraged by the thought that no mortal can ever requite the benefits (euspyeaiac;) of the gods with adequate thanksgiving (caíate; xápiaiv a^ieißeaOai)" (Xenophon Mem. 4.3. 15).31 But "apart from the gen- eral expression x&lt;*piv àTtoôoûvai - the Greek texts of the archaic and classical peri- ods contain no technical terms for acts, tokens, rites, or gifts of thanksgiving to the gods."32 When they eventually appear, ei&gt;xapi&lt;raa and euxctpicrreiv appear to be technical terms for public manifestations of praise in honorary decrees.33 Many 28 Versnel, "Religious Mentality in Ancient Prayer," 45. 29 Ibid., 47. 30 Ibid., 50. 31 Philo expresses the same thing: "How must it not be impossible to recompense or to praise as He deserves Him who brought the universe out of non-existence" {Leg. 3.10). 32 Jan Maarten Bremer, "The Reciprocity of Giving and Thanksgiving in Greek Worship," in Reciprocity in Ancient Greece (ed. Gill et al.), 127-38, here 129. Frederick W. Danker ( Benefactor : Epigraphic Study of a Graeco-Roman and New Testa- ment Semantic Field [St. Louis: Clayton, 1982] 95) demonstrates that "honor" is the reward for virtue and achievement. This typical benefactor citation describes the gestures and vocabulary of public praise: "Decree by Sestos in Honor of Menas son of Menes, Envoy, Gymnasiarch, and Super- visor of the Coinage . . . that he receive his award at the hands of the ephoboi and the neoi, and that</page><page sequence="14">14 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 Greeks felt some obligation to make a response (a|ioißr|) to the gods for benefits received, which was generally praise and honor, not thanksgiving. Robert Parker A group of classicists collaborated on a volume on the topic of Reciprocity in Ancient Greece.34 The book includes one chapter on the anthropology of reci- procity35 and two on Greek prayer.36 Parker's study provides a nuanced consider- ation of the term X&lt;*PK- Mortals, he notes, try to bring offerings that are xaptevta to the gods, and they request a return that is itself xapieaaa, with the consequence that the relation is one in which xápitEç are explicitly exchanged. Since the primary meaning of x&lt;*piÇ is "charm, delight," mortals try to bring the gods things in which they take delight, and in turn urge the gods to "rejoice in" the offerings. "A strong social sense," he says, "existed that 'it is always kharis that begets kharis ' or, as the English say, 'one good turn deserves another.'" Xápiç is given to the gods, who are expected to return a xápiç for which mortals in turn return a x&lt;*pię, and so on. Reciprocity and repayment, then, are associated with x^P1^ words; one gift endowed with xápiç will call forth another. "But a kharis even when given in return for a kharis is not in meaning a recompense Xápiç, moreover, does not mean "thanks" here, so much as honor and an effort to please another. Parker concludes that the basic scenario of exchange was that of an unceasing interchange of delight- ful gifts, a kind of charm war. It would appear that gods are obligated to benefac- tion, both now and in the future, just as mortals receiving these benefits must make some response to the gods.37 Fishing for More Often the ancients made a return to a god with the expectation that as a result, the god's benefaction should continue.38 Thus, Josephus says: "Let all acknowl- he receive a golden crown from the people annually at the games held during the national festival, with the herald making proclamations such as follows, "The people crown Menas son of Menes for the arete and goodwill he has displayed toward the people especially in his two terms of exceptional and recognized service ... to set up a bronze statue of him in the gymnasium ... to invite him and his heirs to front seating at all the games sponsored by the people.'" 34 See n. 12 above. 35 See n. 12 above. 36 Robert Parker, "Pleasing Thighs: Reciprocity in Greek Religion," in Reciprocity in Ancient Greece (ed. Gill et al.), 105-26; and Bremer, "Reciprocity of Giving." 37 Parker, "Pleasing Thighs: Reciprocity in Greek Religion," 108-9; quotations from 109. 38 Simon Pulleyn (Prayer in Greek Religion [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997] 54-55) cites this inscription: "Oenobius the herald, in commemoration, set up here this statue to Hermes,</page><page sequence="15">LOST IN TRANSLATION 1 5 edge before God the bounties which he has bestowed . . . thanksgiving is a natu- ral duty and is rendered alike in gratitude for past mercies and to incline the giver to others yet to come " {A.J. 4.8.13 §4.212 [emphasis added]).39 In benefaction inscriptions a benefactor is praised, but with the proviso that praise will continue only as long as the benefaction does. Josephus reports how Athens honored Hyrcanus: Inasmuch as Hyrcanus continued to show goodwill to our people and to manifest the greatest zeal on their behalf, it has been decreed to honor this man with a golden crown, to set up his bronze statue in the precinct of the temple of Demos, and to announce the award of the crown in the theatres at the festivals; the magistrates shall take care that so long as he continues to maintain his good will toward us everything we can devise shall be done to show honour and gratitude to this man. (A.J. 14.8.5 §§152-54 [emphasis added]) What conclusions may we draw from the survey of Greek mentality and prayer? (1) "Praise" was the appropriate response to benefaction; equally, "thanks" was not. (2) Obligation was incurred by receipt of a favor, response to which was praise. (3) There is evidence of the existence of a cycle of gift-response-gift, and so on, indicating notions of balanced reciprocity, a "charm war." (4) There was no technical term for "thanks" yet. Philo, a Considerate Author Philo helps us recover the appropriate scenario for interpreting these topics. He understands God according to the same philosophical revisionism of his time, namely, that God has "no need" of anything and that God acts altruistically to mor- tals. Philo identifies God by many titles and roles that describe the deity as Bene- factor (eÚ£pYéTí1&lt;;), thus invoking a scenario that he is confident his readers will understand.40 Why does God bestow benefits? For Philo, God acts altruistically; it belongs to God to give and not get.41 Philo agrees with the ancient legends "[t]hat returning a favor." He interprets this in terms of reciprocity. "The xápiÇ [favor/gift] felt by Oeno- bius was reciprocated by an offering which would in turn render the god well disposed to help in the future." Balanced reciprocity, it would seem. 39 Bremer ("Reciprocity of Giving," 130-33) provides eight examples of gifts that make the gods indebted to the giver, the most charming one by the emperor Hadrian. He dedicated a portion of the bear he had just killed to Cupid/Eros and told the boy-archer what he should give Hadrian: "In return for this, breathe down to him [Hadrian], through your own temperance, a favor from heavenly Aphrodite." 40 Philo states: "He is Benefactor (eúepYÉTr|&lt;;), he wills only to bestow benefits (tò eùepyeTeiv). . . . "Without intermission God bestows benefits (euepyeTtov)" {Plant. 86-89; see also Opif. 169). In one satire, Lucian presents the gods giving great favors in exchange for trivial gifts: "Nothing that they [the gods] do is done without compensation. They sell men their blessings, and</page><page sequence="16">16 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 it is the most appropriate work of God to confer benefits (eùepYeTeîv)" (Plant. 130), and not to act in terms of balanced reciprocity. God is not, he insists, bar- gaining like some merchant. You will find that all men sell rather than give and that they, who are receiving favors, are purchasing the benefits. For they who give, hoping to receive a requital, such as praise or honour, and seeking for a return of the favor they are conferring under the specious name of a gift, are, in reality, making a bargain. It is usual for those who sell to receive a price in return for what they part with. But God distributes his good things, not like a seller vending his wares at a high price, but he is inclined to make presents of everything and never desire any return. (Cher. 122-23 [emphasis added]) Note the appropriate response to benefaction: praise or honor. Is this a return gift! Philo insists that from God's side mortals have nothing whatsoever to return to God: "It is impossible to show gratitude to God in a genuine manner, by those means which people in general think the only ones, namely offerings and sacri- fices" (Mut. 126). Philo, however, describes the duty of a person who has lived a life free of all hardships and trials: "[He] is, of necessity, bound to requite God . . . with hymns, and songs, and prayers - all which things taken together have received the one comprehensive name of 'praise'" (Spec. 1.224 [emphasis added]). The only response, then, is the coin of the realm, praise. Here is another important piece of the scenario I am constructing: no "thing" is given God; rather, God's graciousness is acknowledged. Mortals "ought" to praise and honor, not thank. One scholar commenting on the meaning of eityapicrria in the first century writes: "The psy- chological pattern underlying the spontaneous 'benediction' is above all that of admiration and joy ; not of gratitude , which remains subordinated, in fact, to the fundamental feeling of admiration , and is therefore secondary."42 "God needs nothing." Philo's notion of God has gone through the acid bath of anti-anthropomorphic thinking. Out go notions that God needs anything. In comes "negative theology," which purified the way mortals think of the Immortal One.43 Philo provides an excellent example of how we should talk about God, itself a piece of the scenario we seek. one can buy from them health, it may be, for a calf, wealth for four oxen, a royal throne for a hun- dred, a safe return from Troy to Pylos for nine bulls, and a fair voyage from Aulis to Troy for a king's daughter! Hecuba, you know, purchased temporary immunity for Troy from Athena for twelve oxen and a frock. One may imagine, too, that they have many things on sale for the price of a cock or a wreath or nothing more than incense" (Sacr. 2). 42 Jean Paul Audet, "Literary Forms and Contents of a Normal Eùxapiaxia in the First Cen- tury," SE 1 (1959) 646 (emphasis added). 43 On "negative theology," see Harry Austryn Wolfson, "Albinus and Plotinus on Divine Attributes," HTR 45 (1952) 1 15-30; idem, "Negative Attributes in the Church Fathers and the Gnos- tic Basilides," HTR 50 (1957) 145-56; Frances M. Young, "The God of the Greeks and the Nature</page><page sequence="17">LOST IN TRANSLATION 1 7 God alone is the giver; we do not give I know that God can be conceived of as "giv- ing" and "bestowing," but "being given" - this I cannot even conceive of .... it is absolutely necessary for the Truly Existing One to be active, not passive. (Det. 161-62) Reciprocity is neither desired or possible. Of interest here is the philosophers' understanding of God as "having no needs" (à7tpoaÔ£i1c;). "God," Philo states, "has bestowed no gift of grace on Him- self, for He does not need it, but He has given the world to the world" ( Deus 107). Repeatedly he affirms that "God needs nothing" {Mos. 1.157; see Cher. 123; Spec. 2. 1 74).44 Thus, when mortals respond to the deity, they honor God and praise God. Because God needs nothing, it behooves mortals not to act in terms of any type of reciprocity, but to glorify the greatness of the Benefactor. God is not receiving a return gift, but mortals are delighted with God's gift and so praise God. Seneca 's Native Reflections: De Beneficiis Seneca discourses at length on patronage and reciprocity. His conscious atten- tion to these topics can help greatly. In De Beneficiis , he provides a native's for- mal exposition of benefactor-client relationships, appropriate reciprocity, and a reformed view of God. Seneca identifies the high god with names expressive of patronage and benefaction: "It will be right for you," he said, "to call him Jupiter Best and Greatest, and the Stayer and Stabilizer" {Ben. 4.7.1), indicating benefac- tions of power and protection. With what kind of reciprocity do the gods give to mortals? Moreover, what kind of response is appropriate for mortals to give in return to the gods? Gods practice altruistic generosity in their benefaction. Speak- ing of gods' gifts of sun, rain, and crops, Seneca states: "They do all these things without reward, without attaining any advantage for themselves ... the gods are ours for nothing!" (4.25.2-3; see 2.3 1 .3). Moreover, he states, "The gods would not bestow the countless gifts that, day and night, they unceasingly pour forth . . . they will give to no man a benefit if their only motive in bestowing it is a regard for of Religious Language," in Early Church Literature and the Classical Intellectual Tradition: In Honorem Robert M. Grant (ed. William R. Schoedel and Robert L. Wilken; Théologie historique 53; Paris: Beauchesne, 1979)45-73. 44 "God needs nothing" became a commonplace in the Greco-Roman world. See Plutarch Stoic, rep. 1052E; and in Hellenistic Judaism, see "God does not want anything" {Let. Aristeas 211); "O Lord of all, who has need of nothing" (2 Macc 14:35-36); and "Not by deeds is it possible for men to return thanks to God, for the Deity stands in need of nothing and is above all such recom- pense" (Josephus A. J. 8.4.3 § 1 1 1). See Philo Deus 107 and Mos. 1 . 1 57. Of particular richness is the remark of Irenaeus: "The prophets indicate that God stood in no need of their slavish obedience. . . . God needed not their oblation, but [demanded it], on account of man himself who offers it. Because God stands in need of nothing . . . reject those things by which sinners imagined they could propitiate God, and show that He does Himself stand in need of nothing {Adv. Haer. 4. 17. 1 [empha- sis added]).</page><page sequence="18">18 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 themselves and their own advantage" (4.3.2). The gods, then, practice generalized reciprocity. Benefaction, moreover, is not commerce: "When a man bestows a ben- efit, what does he aim at? To be of service and to give pleasure to the one to whom he gives!" (2.31.1). If he expects an exchange, "It would have been, not a bene- faction, but a bargaining" (2.3 1 .2). To calculate how one's benefaction will derive the most gain "is not to be a benefactor but a money-lender" (4.3. 3).45 Seneca declares that "God needs nothing!" For example, "God bestows upon us very many and very great benefits, with no thought of any return, since he has no need of having anything bestowed, nor are we capable of bestowing anything on him" (4.9.1). Truly, the gods need nothing: "Their own nature is sufficient to them for all their needs, and renders them fully provided and safe and inviolable" (4.3.2). IV. Considerate Readers of eityap loxeïv/evxap icrría in Early Christianity How, then, shall we interpret eúxapiatelv/euxapiaTÍa?46 Knowing that "praise" is the cultural monarch of responses to heavenly benefactors, let us exam- ine select usages where ei^apicrreīv appears in combination with "praise." A. EvftapiOTeīv and Meals Half of the occurrences of this verb are in the context of meals: (1) the mul- tiplication of loaves (Mark 8:6; Matt 15:36); (2) the Last Supper (Mark 14:22; Matt 26:26; Luke 22: 19; and 1 Cor 1 1 :24), and (3) other meal scenes (Acts 27:35; Rom 14:6; 1 Cor 10:30-31; 1 Tim 4:4-5). In regard to the account of the Last Sup- 45 Seneca plays the role of an idealist here, for many would disagree with him. The majority would understand that all giving is giving for a return; see Arthur Robinson Hands, Charities and Social Aid in Greece and Rome (Aspects of Greek and Roman Life; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1968) 26-48. 46 Scholars all depend on Schermann 's article for their study of the origin and development of eùxapiatéû), a history repeated in Peter T. O'Brien, "Thanksgiving within the Structure of Pauline Theology," in Pauline Studies: Essays Presented to Professor F. F. Bruce on His 70th Birthday (ed. Donald A. Hagner and Murray J. Harris; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980) 50-66. The history goes thus: eúxaPia*r¿a) was absent until the Hellenistic period; in third-century b.c.e. Asia Minor and Egypt it meant the opposite of what we understand today: "to do a good turn, to oblige," a meaning found also in the papyri. Subsequently it takes on the meaning "to be grateful, to give thanks." It is completely absent from the LXX. Shades of meaning appear, such as Josephus's use of it to mean "congratulate": "Archaelus congratulated (eùxapiartov) Herod on his son-in-law's acquittal" (J. W. 1.23.4 §456). But O'Brien concludes with the remark: "It is clear that Pauline thanksgiving approx- imates to what we normally understand by 'praise'" (p. 62).</page><page sequence="19">LOST IN TRANSLATION 1 9 per, two words are used: eüXoyiíaac; over the bread and £i&gt;xaPiaT1íaaÇ over the cup. Are these words synonymous? EùXoyeîv means "to praise" and is considered by many to be a morph of a berakah.47 Joachim Jeremias noted that eùXoyeîv reflects a Semitic way of praising, whereas eù^apiatelv is a more Greek expression of the same social phenomenon.48 In effect, they do not mean different things. Moreover, scholars of liturgy in the early church still favor as an appropriate translation for ei&gt;Xapi(rrr|aa(; "admiration and joy; gratitude remains subordinated to the funda- mental feeling of admiration and is, therefore, secondary."49 B. Epistolary Prayers A second usage is found in the epistolary prayer that begins most Pauline let- ters.50 Only through modern convention that favors "thanksgiving" over "praise" do we label these "thanksgiving" prayers. There are almost as many epistolary prayers that begin with sùXoyriTÓc; (2 Cor 1 :3; Eph 1:3; 1 Pet 1 :3) as there are that use euxapiatelv; and the meaning of £uXoyr|TÓc; is not in doubt. As with the words over the bread and wine, here too, when seen in parallel with eùXoyriTÓc;, ei&gt;xaPi atelv expresses praise of God rather than gratitude. Moreover, in a world where "praise" reigns, it is faithful to the Pauline scenario to understand these prayers as expressions of praise, not unlike the frequent doxologies found in his let- ters (Rom 16:25-27). Similarly, in regard to the words over the bread and wine, when seen in parallel with euXoyr|TÓ&lt;;, eux^purreiv expresses public praise of God rather than personal gratitude. npd)Tov (lèv euyapiaTO) tej) 8ecj) ļiou EuXoyr|TÒc ó 8eòc Kai nerri) p rov ôià IrļaoO Xpiatoti jtepl ttctvtcov Kupíou rļļicov 'Irļaoi) XpiaroO, ó Ttarfip ù|i(ï)v öti f| TTKJTiç uļicov Tcõv oiKTipļicov Kal 0eòc; Ttaarļc; KaTayyeXXeTai èv öXq&gt; tõ&gt; KÓa|i(p. 4 TtapaKXiíaeax;.

Gerald Hawthorne, Ralph Martin, and Daniel Reid; Downers Grove, IL; InterVarsity, 1993] 69) seems to admit that something is lost by translating these prayers as "thanksgiving": "Pauline thanks- giving approximates what we understand by 'praise,' for it is broader than the expression of grati- tude for personal benefits received."</page><page sequence="20">20 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 71,2009 C.

God's excellence is such that God is "worthy" to receive the most precious things mortals can offer: glory, honor, and eucharistia. Euxapiatia, found here in combination with 8oĶ a Kal tÍ[ít], constitutes a hendiadys of three similar expressions of praise. Similarly in Rev 7:12, all the heavenly court - angels, four living things, and the elders - prostrate in worship as they sing: Aļiiļv, rļ £ÛXoyia Kal fļ ÔóÇa Kal rļ aocpía Kal rļ Euxapiatia Kal f| tīļirļ Kal rļ ôúvajiu; Kal f| iaxùç tü) 0£õ&gt; r)| itôv ťu; toùç aid&gt;va&lt;; tarv akóvtov A|ir|v. (Rev 7:12) Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen. The cornucopia of praise - "blessing," "glory," "wisdom," "honor," "power," and "strength" - all acknowledge God's excellence and worth. In this company, £i)XapiQTÍa must be considered in parallel with these other expressions of praise; 51 See Luke 18:11; John 11:41; Acts 28:15; 1 Cor 14:17; 2 Cor 1:11; Col 4:2. 52 Nouns and verbs are strung together in a rhetorical figure of speech called hendiadys : two (or three) words are connected by a conjunction used to express a single notion, such as grace and favor instead of gracious favor. "The kingdom and the power and the glory" (from the Lord's Prayer) extends the principle, transforming the idea of a "glorious, powerful kingdom" into a sequence of three nouns joined by conjunctions.</page><page sequence="21">LOST IN TRANSLATION 21 it is bizarre to think that the angels and the living things giving "thanks" to God. For what? D. Doxologies In doxologies mortals frequently praise God with some form of SóÇa or Ti(ir|, but rarely with euxapicma. In regard to the language of traditional doxologies, Matthew Black considers 1 Chr 29: 10-1 1 a prime example of a doxology consist- ing of two ways of giving God glory: (1) "blessed" (euXoyiyrcK;) and (2) the cele- bration of God's honorable traits ("the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty").53 "Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of Israel Yours are the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty." In the NT, doxolo- gies may be lean ("To him be glory forever" [Rom 11:36]) or fulsome (" To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen" [1 Tim 1:17]) or expansive ("To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen" [Jude 25]). But doxologies are praise, pure and simple, never thanks. What conclusions may we draw from this? First and most important, when eùxapiatelv is found in the company of expressions of praise and honor, the par- allelism suggests that it shares a similar meaning with them, as a hendiadys (Rom 1:21). Second, should it occur in formal doxologies, it is always in company with words from the semantic domain of honor (Rev 4:8-9; 7:12). Third, even in expres- sions such as "Thanks be to God who . . ." (Rom 7:25; 1 Cor 15:57; 2 Cor 2:14; 8:16; 9:15) there is no compelling reason to read this as anything other than pub- lic praise, such as "Blessed be God who . . ." (Luke 1 :68; 2 Cor 1 :3; Eph 1:3; 1 Pet 1:3). Fourth, clearly the pivotal value of "honor" and "praise" continues to domi- nate the discourse about God and enjoys its place as the dominant value in that culture. V. Summary and Perhaps a Conclusion 1 . As we become considerate readers, we recognize the basic cultural ele- ments of the appropriate scenario of the ancient world that are needed to translate words such as ETtaivelv and euxapicrrelv: (1) the foundational nature of "praise" and "honor" in antiquity; (2) benefactor-client relations; and (3) types of reci- procity. The first is most frequently absent in translation. 53 Matthew Black calls attention to the widespread occurrence of doxologies that begin with "Blessed are you . .

The primary and unique response to the deity in the classical world was "praise," "honor," "glory," and their cousins. The experts emphatically state that "thanks" was not. 3. I pointed out earlier, using the template of Westermann, how significantly different are "praise" and "thanks": public extolling of virtues and accomplish- ments versus interior feeling of gratitude; propaganda for the one praised versus gratitude to a donor. 4. Human response to the deity changes as understanding of the God/gods matures. Once, the gods were thought to be susceptible to gifts of sacrifice and praise. In a genuine exchange, mortals gave to the gods, who gave back in return - suggesting a type of balanced reciprocity (recall Lucian's satire). Much later, however, a different theology emerged that took exception to anthropomorphic descriptions of the gods, which scholars label as "negative theology." In this light, God or the gods "need nothing" - no sacrifices, no bribery, no flattery. They them- selves "need nothing"; mortals cannot make any response save that of praise. No reciprocity enters the relationship. 5. As has been noted, euxapioteiv is absent from the LXX and appears only in the late Hellenistic period. When it does appear, it is generally understood as a synonym of praise. When it finally takes on a public expression rooted in gratitude, it certainly does not supplant praise. 6. Returning to Luke, twice God is "given glory," while Jesus is "thanked." So is there a significant difference between these two terms? Understanding them as synonyms of the primary word "praise," I think not. According to Luke, no one "thanked" God or Jesus, but rather praised or glorified them. But to render "give glory" with "thanks," as the RSV does, loses much in translation. 7. In Tobit 12, the Greek verbs whereby mortals pray to God are uniformly from the semantic word field of "praise." All of them publicly acknowledge God's greatness, indicating that the premier response to God is "praise." But the RSV s triple substitution of "give thanks" for words of "praise" suggests that in the trans- lator's eyes these words had an identical meaning, or even a superior one. This is simply wrong. In the few places in the NT where eùxapicrreïv appears alongside verbs of praise, context suggests that it be taken as a synonym of them. 8. God, who gives altruistically, needs nothing. So no type of reciprocity is possible for mortals. God "gives," but does not "barter." Balanced reciprocity is theoretically out of consideration. But we saw data that suggest that the deity gives benefaction with the expectation of return gifts, a "charm war." Moreover, the heart of euxctpiarelv lies in the sense of duty or obligation for the person blessed to repay the deity in some way. Here we find clear traces of balanced reci- procity.54 54 Bonnie MacLachlan {The Age of Grace: Charis in Early Greek Poetry [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993] 7-8) indicates the inherent ambiguity of xápiç in terms of reci-</page><page sequence="23">LOST IN TRANSLATION 23 9. Although it is not an absolute criterion, praise is public, whereas thanks is private. Praise is essentially vocal and spontaneous; it seeks to persuade others to acknowledge the deeds of God. Thanks, however, is a thought within a person; if expressed, it is of no concern to anyone else. The leper gives glory to God, as well as publicly praises Jesus. procity: "The exchange of charis- favors was founded upon a very general psychological phenom- enon, the disposition to return pleasure to someone who has given it. This pleasure exchange was accepted as a serious social convention ... the charis convention amounted to a lex talionis, but of a positive sort. A benefaction called for a suitable return, and reprisals might be taken when the anticipated reciprocity did not occur." She leaves no doubt about her understanding of "Only balanced reciprocity interests us in a study of charis, for it is the only one that is strictly reciprocal."</page></plain_text>
