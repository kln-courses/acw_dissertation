<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 744 Zigarovich’s attention to graves without bodies and her treatment of all writing  as epitaphic provide depth to numerous passages in The Woman in White (1860) in which  tombstones are cleaned, effaced, or re-inscribed, evade the truth, mark empty coffins,  and create or destroy meaning. Zigarovich gives a lapidary rendering of the moment  when, standing next to her own gravestone, Laura Fairlie turns into the “living embodi- ment of the unreadable epitaph” (101). The most stirring and useful parts of this chapter  and the last one, on The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870), involve her research on Collins’s  and Dickens’s instructions to their printers to reproduce epitaphs in their books as they  might appear on engraved tombstones. Zigarovich reproduces these epitaphs, along with,  in the case of Collins, his drawings of them in his manuscript. These empty tombs in  books give weight and meaning to her argument that the “act of writing itself is related to  the act of inscribing a gravestone” (11). In a brilliant move, Zigarovich pictures Collins’s  own marker and his grave, which eerily contains the body of his mistress, whose presence  is not indicated on the tombstone, alongside his own corpse. Her name: Caroline Graves. even though there has been a mountain of scholarship on death and Our  Mutual Friend (1865)—most of which Zigarovich discusses—she manages to add to our  understanding of the ways in which the inability to die in the novel relates to (dis) articulation, to writing on, above, and without bodies. “Death is a fiction for us,” Ziga- rovich remarks, “until we die our own death” (126). In her chapter on Bleak House  (1852–53), she convinces us that esther summerson writes from a “virtually post- mortem position” by enumerating the many ways in which her past is an empty tomb:  one where her mother is supposed to be, but isn’t, where she is supposed to be, but isn’t  (58). Her father is “no body” (Nemo), and the burial of her doll and its mirroring in the  death of Jenny’s unnamed baby with esther’s initialed handkerchief as a kind of marker  make Zigarovich’s figure of the lacking corpse radiate with meaning.  Zigarovich’s examination of words as representations of the irrevocably absent,  of the body lost, bring to mind the preoccupation many Victorians had with present,  actual corpses (which Zigarovich mentions briefly in her introduction). Here, language  breaks up against the stilled, silent body as object, the thing itself without mediation. What  happens to representation then? This takes me back to Charlotte Brontë. As I discuss else- where, the last volume of the manuscript of Shirley is in such an untidy, cut-and-pasted state  that it materializes grief and works as an inscribed, papery cenotaph. Locks of hair were  cut from Anne’s and emily’s corpses and woven together into a bracelet, a necklace, and a  few other pieces of jewelry, as was common practice at the time, and it is likely Charlotte  wore one of these pieces, perhaps even when she sat down to write Villette.

New York: Fordham university Press, 2012, $60.00. In the four essays that make up The Man versus the State (1884), Herbert spencer took  aim at what he saw as the liberty-destroying encroachments upon the life of the British  citizen by an increasingly regulatory state. For the government to abandon its   VICTOrIAN sTuDIes / VOLume 56, NO. 4 </page> <page sequence="2">  745 traditional focus on preserving negative liberty, and take up the mantle of benefactor,  was for spencer to take the first steps down a Hayekian road to serfdom. This emergent  political and conceptual entity—the British counterpart, en germe, to Otto von  Bismarck’s Wohlfahrtsstaat—is the focus of Zarena Aslami’s The Dream Life of Citizens. she  is interested, however, not only in malcontents like spencer (whose classical-liberal  suspicion of government earns him a cameo appearance in her introduction as a minor  villain, a kind of Grover Norquist in side whiskers) but also in those who saw in a  personified state a heroic figure, or a loving, even “erotic” partner (34). Framing her  study as a state-centered analogue to Benedict Anderson’s famous inquiry into the  collective imagination of the nation, Aslami invites the late Victorian Briton onto the  couch to discuss his or her recurrent dream in which the state appears on a white horse.  Her examples of “state fantasy” are drawn from a range of late Victorian novels by  authors who, she contends, “framed the state in affective terms, dramatizing the feel- ings and fantasies of a culture that was increasingly optimistic about the state’s capacity  to intervene on behalf of its citizens” (1). The Dream Life of Citizens begins on the margins of empire, with chapters  focusing respectively on south Africa and Afghanistan. In the first of these, Aslami  reads Olive schreiner’s The Story of an African Farm (1883) as “an origin story for late  Victorian state fantasy” (21). Borrowing from Hannah Arendt’s account of the differ- ences between the French and British modes of imperialism, Aslami discusses the  stranger on horseback who appears to young Waldo (in an emotionally charged  encounter) as an embodiment of the model of “aloof rule” favored by the latter power:  “although a functionary and not seemingly having direct power over Waldo, the strang- er’s relay between arrogance and shame, distance and intimacy, becomes an allegory  for British rule in south Africa, at least over its european settlers” (41). Chapter 2  considers a pair of popular novels—George Alfred Henty’s For Name and Fame (1886)  and Arthur Conan Doyle’s A Study in Scarlet (1887)—alongside a number of nonfic- tional texts in documenting the symbolic construction of “‘Victorian Afghanistan,’ a  complex cluster of images, ideas, and affects that crystallized across the nineteenth  century” (22). Aslami turns in chapter 3 to Thomas Hardy’s The Woodlanders (1887),  compellingly showing the ways in which the novel depicts recent reforms in British  divorce law—specifically the matrimonial Causes Act of 1857, its particulars garbled by  geographical and cultural distance—as registering, in the rustic imagination, as “fanta- sies of the magical powers of the state” (87). Aslami’s discussion of George Gissing’s The  Odd Women (1893)—the subject of chapter 4—grows from a bantering exchange  between rhoda Nunn and everard Barfoot centering upon a possible role for the  modern state in subsidizing matrimony, and widens in scope to argue for Gissing’s elab- oration of “a model of critical consciousness based on novel reading, which comes to  offer British subjects a possible position outside the state” (23). Finally, Aslami considers  sarah Grand’s New Woman novel The Heavenly Twins (1893), reminding the reader that  the paradigmatic scenario anatomized in previous chapters—“the fantasy of the state  as a heroic actor”—remains essentially a fantasy of the patriarchal state, one in which  women are relegated to a second-class mode of “hysterical citizenship” (131). Aslami’s insightful study is, then, impressively far-ranging with respect to  genre; yet at least one omission seems to me significant enough to merit some discus- sion here. The Dream Life of Citizens excludes socialist and utopian fiction such as William  summer 2014 </page> <page sequence="3"> 746 morris’s News from Nowhere (1890) and H. G. Wells’s A Modern Utopia (1905), ostensibly  because such texts “typically do not feature libidinally intense scenes in which charac- ters fantasize about the state as a person who could take care of them” (20); for this and  other reasons they are not true “fantas[ies] of the state as a heroic actor” (21). And yet  Wells’s novel, at least, would seem to fit these criteria quite well; his personified (and  duly capitalized) state is very much a heroic actor in Aslami’s sense, an imagined figure  who “insist[s] upon every citizen being properly housed, well nourished, and in good  health,” when not personally (as it were) lending money to the needy or tearing down  substandard housing with Its mighty, anthropomorphic hands (A Modern Utopia [C.  scribner’s sons, 1905], 138). As for the libidinal, I am confident that a sufficiently kinky  reading of Wells’s novel might easily be elaborated, given the role he envisions for the  state in the marital bed, as well as its facilitation of polyamorous trysts. Perhaps the real  difficulty in including such works lies elsewhere—namely, in a certain generic kinship  or resemblance between utopian fiction and The Dream Life of Citizens itself. In the  book’s coda, Aslami expresses disappointment that, in her view at least, we live in an  age of widespread state pessimism (“It is how we talk about the state now: wearily”). This  is regrettable, she opines in the book’s concluding passage, because such “weari- ness . . . belies an optimism that the state could be able to protect everyone from the  brutalities of capitalism and to achieve social justice. If nations . . . are premised on  exclusion, could the state form be premised on something other than an inclusion/ exclusion model? If the state knows that we love it, can it act responsibly to us and safe- guard our love? After all . . . the state needs the love of its subjects to exist” (162). I myself find the implied exhortation to give the state our “love” rather discon- certing (a half-remembered riff by slavoj Žižek on the recruiting poster featuring uncle  sam as a kind of bloodless, insatiate vampire comes to mind as I write). But even readers  who find nothing objectionable in such a passage may be led to suspect that it may be  Aslami’s own fantasy of the state that is at least partly responsible for limiting the scope of  her study. After all, Wells, too, hated capitalism, sought “social justice” (a phrase he used  in his The Outline of History [1920] and elsewhere), and was “optimistic” about the possibili- ties inherent in a World-state that transcended national boundaries. unfortunately, his  articulated versions of the utopian-statist fantasy are unpalatable today (even A Modern  Utopia, less egregiously odious than its predecessor Anticipations [1901], contains the odd  eugenicist gem: “There is only one sane and logical thing to be done with a really inferior  race, and that is to exterminate it” [337]); moreover, Wells’s later calls, in propria persona,  for “liberal fascism” and “enlightened nazi[sm]” risk calling to mind some of the twen- tieth century’s less savory experiments in state aggrandizement (qtd. in Philip Coupland,  “H.G. Wells’s ‘Liberal Fascism’” Journal of Contemporary History 35 [2000], 542, 549). He is,  in short, a singularly poor advertisement for utopian statism. I have dilated upon this particular omission, then, first of all because to  exclude this important class of texts seems a missed opportunity in a work that has  much to offer scholars of the period; but also because it is difficult to avoid surmising  that the book’s reluctance to scrutinize the “state fantasies” of figures like Wells may  stem in part from a disinclination to historicize its own.
