The band was one of the last groups permanently living in the bush. Although they had contact with Aborigines living on government or mission stations, they still maintained a perfect knowledge of all original techniques and traditions. During a short stay with them, when the men led by Mandarrg built themselves a hut near the expedition camp, I took notice of a number of things, particularly of a technological nature – the building of the hut, the preparation of food, manufacture of stone implements, bark painting, rock painting, making and throwing of spears, hunting with dogs and their relationship to the dogs. This article is a reprint of a previously published article (Jelínek J., 1979: Anthropologie (Brno) 17, 2–3: 307–323).

Though they had contact mushroom-shaped rock, there were traces of fireplaces with Aborigines living on government or mission and a few stone tools were lying at random on the surface stations, and owned a variety of things such as a steel (all of recent blade-type) and above all a great number knife, an axe, tin containers made from cans, pieces of of flakes of all kinds, together with several cores (Figure clothing, etc., they still maintained a perfect knowledge 1). The cores often had a flat ventral side (the original of all primitive techniques and traditions, which they also surface), and flakes had been removed from the dorsal used when necessary. side. These cores were plane-shaped. The second group During a short stay with them, when the men led by of cores was discoidal – these cores have been worked Mandarrg, built themselves a hut near the expedition on both sides. The flakes obtained from them were camp, I took notice of a number of things, particularly usually shorter. It must be added, that the ceiling and of a technological nature – the building of the hut, the walls of the rock overhang were richly decorated with preparation of food, manufacture of stone implements, paintings. There was none of the oldest type of paintings bark painting, rock painting, making and throwing of of dynamic human figures here. On the other hand there spears, hunting with dogs and their relationship to the were several monochrome red animal figures, ancient dogs. anthropomorphic figures with sings of the incipient X-ray style and polychrome figures of primitive style. There were neither developed X-ray style paintings, nor white THE MANUFACTURE OF STONE IMPLEMENTS paintings belonging to the youngest layer. The place seems to have served as workshop for the manufacture Several stone implements, blades and points, all of of tools for many generations. It was used as living site the most recent type, were found in the sand close to the only exceptionally, if at all. Among other things it is hut. Since, as indicated by the remains of fireplaces and rather inaccessible. It is the highest point of the area, and of corroboree bones, Mandarrg had fairly often used the so it is far from water. Nearer to the river there are plenty same camp site in the past, it was difficult to decide of overhanging rocks in more accessible places, more whether the implements had been made by Mandarrg suitable for long-term occupation. himself, or by some one else. Now, if stone implements were at hand, and if they were required, Mandarrg used them for simple tasks. More often, of course, he used the steel knife belonging to his son Bunganyial. Mandarrg's devotion to this son was great, and they were seldom apart. Thus Mandarrg normally could use of the steel knife. In an attempt to find out whether the stone implements used by Mandarrg were merely found or actually made by him, I asked him whether he made such tools. His answer was in the affirmative, and he led us to a large, mushroom-shaped rock formation on the opposite (the left), bank of the river, about 500 metres from our camp. He seemed to know the place well, since he went among the boulders, through a rocky maze, unhesitatingly taking the shortest and the only scalable route. When we started our way up this large rock formation, he indicated an overhanging rock, in whose shelter were hidden three human skulls and several long bones, and said that he had lived here with his group during the last rainy season (1968 to 1969). I asked him if he did not mind that there were skulls in the vicinity. The answer was negative, with the explanation that the FIGURE 1. Upper Cadell River.

He weighed various stones in his hand and then he chose one about twice the size of a man's fist. Then he chose his hand with heavy blows, either in the air (he often suitable raw material. He tested and examined some of knocked it out of his left hand onto the ground), or the bigger discarded cores, as well as stones not yet placing it on the hard base of the rock surface. When worked.

When he of anyone around him nor of the fact that he had cut his managed to separate a suitable piece of raw material of ankle with the sharp edge of the core. After a total of two the required size, he sat down and began to make stone hours of work he put to one side seventeen flakes (Figure blades. He usually worked them on the soft part of his 3).

Another flake lacked the pointed shape of most of the others; it ended in a sharp crosswise edge. Mandarrg described it also as being suitable for a spear point. The truth is however, that in the camp all the blades made by Mandarrg were put to the post supporting the roof and he used them in various ways: as knives for cutting bark and butchering killed animals, as scrapers for making ropes and strings from bark; as drills, for boring small depressions into wood for fire-making with drilling slicks – and finally he used a blade with a crosswise sharp edge as a chisel for making thin bark in preparation for painting (Figure 6). With this stone chisel in his right hand he chopped the outer side of the bark and pulled off the cut fibres with his right hand. The best seventeen blades (with the exception of the above-mentioned chisel) really ended up as spear points. These stone tools were never hafted, they were always held directly in the hand. Most blades and points may be considered as multi-purpose tools, although they serve mostly as spear points and knives. The material used in all cases was heavily silicified fine local sandstone. It must be added that Bunganyial, the son of FIGURE 6. Upper Cadell River. Mandarrg using stone flake as Mandarrg, was also able to make stone tools, though not a chisel to work the eucalyptus bark.

I observed the building of such a hut yield protection against the sun. Several fires were made by the men of Mandarrgs group. Using a digging stick around the hut, as necessary. At night they often lit a fire of about 120 cm long (commonly used by the Aborigines right beside the hut and lay close to it to get some warm. to dig up yam tubers) they first lapped a tree trunk, to Besides this most common type of hut, with a height find out, whether the bark was thick enough.

Then they peeled it or cut off and leaned against a tree trunk, in order lo off with the same stick in as big pieces as possible. In provide temporary shade.

They 100 cm high. These roofs are supported by two vertical cut three posts and for the fourth they used the natural posts forked at their ends. These posts carry the beam fork of a living tree. Two and two posts were connected forming the ridge of the roof (Figure 8). The posts are with a stick; on the framework obtained in this way they braced by oblique stakes always two at the front and two threw the green eucalyptus branches left over from at the back, standing on the ground or resting on other cutting the posts and then placed three pieces of paper forked sticks, usually shorter than the main ones. bark on top of the construction.

In this case two sticks formed the ridge of the roof and there were six oblique stakes, i.e., two for each forked support. The dimensions of the huts varied, apparently according to the number of people they were supposed to accommodate. The length of such a shelter varies from 100 to 400 cm. The fireplaces were scattered around the huts at random, their number ranging from one to four – I never found more than four around one hut. This is quite natural since the Aborigines leave these huts after a time – either when too much rubbish, remnants of food, etc. attracting large numbers of insects, has accumulated around the hut, or when it becomes uncomfortable for other reasons. In such a case they move to other place and build a simple shelter there. Almost all huts have a flat stone for various forms of hammering, smashing or rubbing. There are different kinds of fireplaces. Those in the very vicinity of the hut serve for heating. Usually only wood is used as fuel. The position of the other fireplaces varies; they may be up to 600 cm from the hut. Some of them contain stones about the size of a fist, probably for food cooking; in others there are pieces of termites' nests, keeping hot for a long time, after being burnt. Sometimes there were stones for baking, placed in a slightly dish-shaped hole, around which the earth FIGURE 11. Wilton River. A sunshine protection. This figure was in had been heaped.

The carcass of the of them formed a base, in which a shallow depression animal was carelessly tossed on the fire, or on its edge had been made with a steel knife, a stone point, or with and the meat was eaten only slightly singed, almost a pointed bone; the other piece of wood was then placed completely raw.

The group found its food easily The right-hand front and rear posts and the left-hand enough and none of them was undernourished, though front and rear posts were joined with sticks. Across these 235 </page> <page sequence="10"> Jan Jelínek three further sticks were laid loosely and were covered with pieces of bark. The longest piece of stringy bark formed the central section of the rear wall and was a few centimetres deep in the sand. This piece was bent at right angle to form the central part of the roof as well. Only the inner side of the bark was painted, after completing the construction of the hut. This can be proved by the fact that the paint had run downwards on the vertical part, and also by the fact that on the ceiling the painting was interrupted by the sticks forming the framework of the roof. Besides the piece of stringy bark there were four pieces of paper bark on the roof and the barks were weighted down with nine big stones. Two of them, the flattest ones, bore traces of colour, revealing that they had originally been used for mixing paint. The rear posts were 135 cm high; the front ones measured only 120 cm. The hut was 160 cm wide and was 130 cm deep. Around it there were many traces of human activities. Behind the rear wall there were food remains, about 20 shells of the Unio shellfish. Alongside the hut lay pieces of peeled and rumpled stringy bark strands, evidently prepared for FIGURE 18.

We speak of one occupant – the small dimensions of the hut indicate in all likelihood that there was one; at the most there were two, inhabitants. On the inner side of the bark there are paintings of a kangaroo (Figure 22) and of a supernatural being, a spirit (on the rear wall), and of a goanna (on the ceiling, Figure 23). The most frequently used colours are red (haematite) and white (clay), then yellow (limonite) and some black (diluted charcoal), used for painting the kangaroo's muzzle only. The kangaroo painting is high. The body is in white, the contours and details of the body are in red and yellow lines. It is a large male kangaroo painted in perfect X-ray style. Inside the body are drawn the spine, joints, gullet, heart, lungs, liver and stomach. The head and the ends of the hind legs have been repainted. Drops of white colour clearly showed that the painting had been done in vertical position, i.e., after completing the erection of the hut.

ROCK PAINTING Mandarrg's oldest son Bunganyial painted a white crocodile with eggs inside its body (Figure 42), at the workshop for making stone tools. He started painting from the tail (Figure 43) and then he painted the hind legs (Figure 44), the body in dorsal view, and finally the head (Figure 45), again in lateral view, similarly as the tail. He painted the tail so as to accentuate its characteristic crest. The eggs were in fact unpainted circular rock surfaces inside the white body of the crocodile (Figure 46). Bunganyial kept the white China clay diluted with water and saliva in his mouth. After completing the painting with a chewed strip of stringy bark he sputtered the rest of the paint on his left hand put on the rock. Thus arose a typical white hand stencil. On our question, what it was, Bunganyial explained that it was his hand, since it is his rock, because he painted the crocodile. In fact he marked his property. The white colour used was taken from the nearby billabong, where it formed a layer beneath the water FIGURE 42. Upper Cadell River. Crocodile rock painting in a simple (Figure 47).

The X-ray characters are only rudimentary (e.g., the central longitudinal line in the animal body) and are also quite rare. Most paintings lack any X-ray character. In few cases some engraved lines and simple engraved figures were found. Even these figures appear only exceptionally in the Arnhem Land art. In one superimposed group of paintings an engraved crocodile figure was found. Red colour prevails in all paintings. The white paintings, representing in most of the other galleries the latest art, are quite exceptional here. All these features show that the locality has only a marginal position, compared with other galleries found in north and central Arnhem Land. The third locality we studied comprises three galleries in Bulman Gorge. The first two galleries are right in Bulman Gorge, in the vicinity of the big cave. The oldest paintings here belong to the archaic style; they are in red and picture some characters similar to the other archaic style paintings in Arnhem Land (Brandi 1974, 1978, Chaloupka 1978, Jelínek 1979).
