Gaca Vanderbilt University By the late fouri century, prominent Christian leaders no longer remained content to advocate religious separatism from their polytheistic social environment. Instead, they started making more strenuous efforts in law and in the streets to prohibit Greek and other pagan religious practices in the Roman Empire.' This change in policy and practice was the outcome of historical factors that need better explanation than that of the unavoidable destiny of Christianity. One important aspect of this change, I argue here, is a problematic innovation in the tradition of Hellenistic Jewish and early Chris- tian polemic against polyffieism. The innovation derives from Paul's letter to the Ro- mans and develops through patristic endorsements of Paul's argument. In Rom 1:1S 32 Paul fully reworks the Hellenistic Jewish polemical tradition, even though his argu- ment is not yet recognized today as the distinctive proclamation that it is. Nonetheless, the polemic he wages inRom 1:18-32 is anomalous in the tradition before, during, and for a century after he lived. *I thank Dimitri Gondicas, Alexander Nehamas, and other members of the Princeton Program in Hellenic Studies for facilitating my research on this article. I also am grateful to Jonathan E. Bremer, Robert Drews, and the readers and editors of this journal for their valuable comments and sugges- tions. All translations of Greek and Latin texts in this article are mine, unless otherwise noted. lThis change in policy is reinforced by repressive social mechanisms, such as vandalism against temples and taking away their endowments.

The individual expressions of the polemic vary in rhetorical intensity but advocate the following generic position: ancient Mediterranean polytheism is an immoral delusion rooted in religious ignorance and false notions of deity. Gen- tiles, who are either fools of their own accord or duped by demons, would do well to recognize their folly, part ways with their religious heritage, and join the en- lightenment of biblical monotheism.2 As I demonstrate here, however, this argu- ment represents only one line of the polemical tradition, was originally the most prevalent in early Christianity, and develops in line with Hellenistic Jewish po- lemic, such as Wisdom 13-14. A second and distinct argument in the polemical tradition asserts that the an- cient ancestors of the Greeks, or of the Greeks and other Gentiles, once recognized and yet brazenly abandoned biblical monotheism. Unnamed wise persons are to blame for leading the rebellion. The renegade descendants accordingly must re- awaken and convert back to monotheism in its Christian form. This argument is far more conducive than the first to a stance of intolerance toward Greek and other Gentile religions. Paul in Rom 1 :18-32 is its Elrst and most influential proponent. There is a striking difference between the first argument in its Christian version and the argument motivated by Romans. The first assumes that pagans are genuine 2"Christian apology is the daughter of Jewish apology," Johannes Geffcken, cited with approval in Arthur J. Droge, Homer or Moses? (Tubingen: Mohr/Siebeck, 1989) 8; and see Droge's n. 27 for more scholarly opinions to the same effect. So too Eduard Norden, "Es war althergebrachte Sitte schon vorchristlicher Zeit, den Kampf gegen den Polytheismus mit einer Polemik gegen die Idololatrie zu verbinden" (Agnostos Theos [Leipzig: Teubner, 1913] 12). Similarly, for Jean Danidlou, there is but one "Christian missionary proclamation to the pagan world" worked out in the early apologists, namely, condemnation of myths, philosophical teachings, pagan morals, and religion (Gospel Message and Hellenistic Culture: A History of Early Christian Doctrine before the Council of Nicaea [Philadelphia: Westminster, 1973] 2. 37,16-24 Likewise Johannes Quasten, Patrology (Westminster: Newman,1950-86) 2.8; and A. J. Festugiere as cited by Clarence A. Forbes, Firmicus Maternus (ACW 37; New York: Newman, 1970) 29 n. 121. The misperception of common substance is most striking in direct comparisons made between Rom 1:18-32 and Hellenistic Jewish polemic, such as Wisdom 13-14. Brendan Byrne (Romans [Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1996] 65) writes, "These parallels [between Romans and Wisdom of Solomon] show that in 1:18-32 Paul argues out of a defined tradition in Hellenistic Judaism.... [H]e ... [uses] a conventional polemic against the Gentile world and its idolatry"; James D. G. Dunn (Romans 1-8 [Word Biblical Commen- taries; Dallas: Word, 1988] 61) states, "The argument [in Romans 1:23-27] now becomes almost wholly Jewish by drawing on the standard Jewish polemic against idolatry." See also E. P. Sanders (Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1983] 123): "I think that in Rom 1:18-2:29 Paul takes over to an unusual degree homiletic material from Diaspora Judaism, [and] that he alters it in only unsubstantial ways."</page><page sequence="3">KATHY L. GACA 167 religious outsiders and tries to convince them to recognize the biblical God for the first time through Christianity. The second assumes that some or all pagans are rebellious religious insiders and gives a biblically potent rationale for compelling them to "retum" to Christianity. Paul's argument, as I will show also, is initially a lone voice that does not im- mediately become prevalent. Starting in the later second century, however, Rom 1:18-32 convinces numerous patristic writers from Tatian through Chrysostom and thereby begins to take hold. One main reason for the shift is that some of the early church fathers come to esteem Paul as a theologian of impeccable authority. Their endorsements of Rom 1:18-32 consequently portray Greeks or Greeks and other Gentiles as apostates. Various Greek philosophers, further, come to be iden- tified as the falsely so-called wise men whom Paul blames for leading the rebel- lion against God. This new argument against polytheism reaches a heightened fervor by the late fourth century, when major church fathers such as Athanasius, Augustine, and Chrysostom ardently advocate and elaborate Rom 1 : 18-32. It must remain an open question here whether Rom 1: 18-32 actually motivated the intolerance in late antiquity or only provided a convenient rationale for it. The success of Paul's argument depends on numerous factors, only a few of which I can explore here: the authoritative stature that Rom 1:18-32 gains over time and the parameters of identity given to the allegedly apostate Gentiles and their lead- ers. By contrast, the Elrst line of argument against polytheism, though hardly be- nevolent toward ancient Mediterranean religions, offers neither a formula for sup- pressing religious diversity nor a smear campaign against Greek philosophers. I now explore the first argument against polytheism in Hellenistic Judaism, so that it can then become clear how and why the polemic deriving from Romans does present such a formula and campaign. r The First Argument against Polytheism in Hellenistic Judaism The Hellenistic Jewish argument against polytheism is most thoroughly expli- cated inWis 13:1-14:31.3 Ps.-Solomon maintains that peoples who think that there is a plurality of gods in the physical world are unenlightened about biblical mono- 3Joseph Ziegler, ed., Sapientia Salomonis (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1962).

David Winston (Wisdom of Solomon: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary [Garden City: Doubleday, 1979] 20, 59- 63) prefers to have Ps.-Solomon depend on Philo rather than the reverse and thus is able to suggest that Wisdom dates as late as 37-41 CE. The consensus still stands, I think. Winston's argument would require one to believe that of all writers influenced by Philo (such as Clement and Origen), Ps.-Solomon alone was able to use Philo's distinctive mix of Platonic and bib- lical elements without reflecting any of its Platonic aspects. This mix of elements in Philo's</page><page sequence="4">168 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW theism and have "ignorance" to blame for thinking that there are many gods.4 There is only one god who at least partially transcends the world and is its crafts- man, master, and arranger, in short, its yEvEolapXnS.5 As the multivalence of yEvEvtapXq5 shows, Ps.-Solomon's conception of God is grounded strictly in the biblical tradition. The god who commences the genesis of the physical world is identical with the god who appears at the beginning of Genesis, which itself starts with the phrase EV apXn hence the term yEvEolapXq5 names the god who "in the beginning made heaven and earth." Gentiles who do not recognize the supreme and solitary power of the creator god in Genesis are religious outsiders who fail to grasp the two aspects of Ps.-Solomon's teleological argument for God's existence. First, the world is a magnificently designed and directed work of craftsmanship, so a creator god must have fashioned it with the design in mind.6 Second, the creator god is to be identiEled unconditionally as the God of the Greek Genesis and laws. Pagans in the main are in a state of culpable ignorance because they ac- knowledge neither that the world has one god who crafted it nor that the creator god is the God of Genesis. They worship multiple icons of false gods and thus show that they are completely empty-headed about God.7 Among philosophers, however, the culpability decreases markedly if their cosmologies posit a single creator god. Philosophers with such cosmologies take the first step toward biblical monotheism, or so Ps.-Solomon maintains. They fail to take the second step, how- ever, for God as creator in the philosophical cosmologies is not a solitary deity but a supreme regent among other genuine gods, as is Zeus to the other Olympians.8 Ps.- thought, however, is merged together and unmistakable, rather like an impressionist painting. Ps.-Solomon simply does not show this Philonic technique, while other writers influenced by Philo do. 4Wis 13:1-2. As here, 'ignorance' translates aywcoola, aywola, or other cognate terms in all citations to follow from Hellenistic Jewish and early Christian arguments against polythe- ism. 5WiS 13:3 6Ibid. 1 3:5. 7Ibid. 14:12-14. 8Platonist philosophers make this observation themselves to contest the cogency of the second step in the Hellenistic Jewish and early Christian teleological argument. As Porphyry or a like-minded Platonist philosopher states, "Let us expressly investigate the question con- cerning the monarchy of the sole God and the manifold rule of the revered gods, because you do not even know how to explain the word 'monarchy'. A monarch is not one who exists alone, but is the only one ruling [others].... [Similarly] God would not rightly be called a monarch unless he ruled gods. For this is fitting to the divine grandeur and great heavenly glory" (Apocriticus of Macarius Magnes, 4.20, fr. 75; Adolf von Harnack, Porphyrius "Gegen die Christen " [Berlin: K6nig. Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1916]). Hence "as far as the Platonists are concerned, the monarchy [that is, the supreme sole status] of God is not at all demon- strated" (Theophilus, 2.4; and note Minucius Felix [Octavius 20.2] for popular pagan disbelief in the unicus deus). See further Pierre Courcelle, "Anti-Christian Arguments and Christian</page><page sequence="5">KATHY L. GACA 169 Solomon, accordingly, finds Greek philosophers more commendable than other Gentiles because he interprets their pluralistic monotheism as a step in the nght direction toward biblical monotheism.9 Nonetheless, Gentiles are to blame rela- tive to their degrees of ignorance, for they should have been able to infer biblical monotheism from nature itself without any need for Genesis as commentary. Still, since philosophers have been getting watm in their search for the biblical God, they are not as cold as their compatriots and the stones that they worship. Ps.- Solomon therefore argues that pagan culture is and always has been religiously alien and blind to God's manifest existence. He reinterprets the myriad projects of philosophical monotheism as quests for the biblical God and commends the search. Though as yet unsuccessful, philosophers have at least been groping in the right direction with one eye partly open. Nowhere does Ps.-Solomon contend that any pagans once knew the creator god of Genesis only to be led astray into polytheistic idolaty. Wisdom's argument that Gentiles are theologically ignorant outsiders is in keep- ing with the polemic offered in other Hellenistic Jewish sources. Philo, Josephus, and numerous passages in the Sibylline Oracles likewise maintain that biblical monotheism is obviously embedded in nature, which makes the conspicuous pres- ence of many gods in their society problematic. Given that one god alone, the biblical one, is naturally to be inferred from the world, why have relatively few made the inference and so many done otherwise? The solution of these polemicists Platonism from Arnobius to St. Ambrose," in Arnaldo Momigliano, ed., The Conflict Between Paganism and Christianity in the Fourth Century (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963) 158; and Garth Fowden (Empire to Commonwealth: Consequences of Monotheism in Late Antiquity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993) 5. Consequently, the biblically grounded version of the teleological argument should not continue to be identified with its philosophical counterpart, as it is in the following instances. "The author of Wisdom has here reproduced the teleological and cosmological arguments for the existence of God which had already been elaborated by Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoa" (Winston, Wisdom, 253). "On lisait le meme idee [chez Paul et] . . . chez un Stoicien peripateticien du Ier siecle de notre ere dont l'oeuvre a ete longtemps attribuee a Aristote [in De mundo 6]" (Marie-Joseph Lagrange, St. Paul Spitre aux romains [Paris: Gabalda, 1916] 24). Ambrosiaster provides a valuable corrective to such loose iden- tifications when he writes, "God founded such beautiful stars so that he could be recognized (ut possit agnosci) and be worshipped alone (et solus adorari) as the very great and magnifi- cent creator of them" (Ad rom. 1.18). The second step, ut possit solus adorari, is entirely absent from the pluralistic monotheism of the philosophers, such as Ps.-Aristotle, De mundo 6, who states only that the invisible creator god is visible from the created works themselves (a0EcopTlToS a rrs auTcow TCJW E&gt;pySW oEXpEITal). Winston (Wisdom, 253) provides a valuable list of other Greek and Roman expressions of the teleological argument. The first step of the Jewish teleological argument does not necessarily draw on the Greek philosophical tradition, for the same inchoate idea is in the Septuagint, such as Ps 18:1 LXX: 0l oupaVol slnyouwTal sotaw oEOU, WOI:IV sE XElpSW aUTOU aVaYyEAAEI TO OTEpESpa. 9Wis 13:6-9.</page><page sequence="6">170 HARVARD THEOLOG ICAL REVI EW is to argue likewise that foolish ignorance motivates the Gentiles to have a diver- sity of gods, not to reexamine their own premise. Josephus, reacting to criticisms of Judaism, rounds off his critique of Greek polytheism by wondering, "What is the cause of such great error and absence of regulation about the nature of God?" Unlike Moses, he offers in response, Greek lawgivers simply did not know about God. Solon, Lykurgos, and the like "did not know the true nature of God from the start" when they established Hellenic customs and beliefs. They were "unable to formulate such accurate knowledge." The ignorance of the Greek lawgivers in turn gave free rein to poets, painters, and sculptors, who fashion as gods whatever strikes their creative fancy. There are, however, "Greek philosophers who saw the truth," such as Plato, and they are a noble exception to the norm of Gentile igno- rance. Plato followed the Jews in formulating his "true and fitting opinion about God," which he prudently refrained from trying to share with the populace at large.l° The Greeks are thus well advised to learn better and to honor the biblical God properly, as Plato does.ll Josephus, therefore, agrees with the Hellenistic Jew- ish thesis that Gentile ignorance accounts for the absence of universal belief in the biblical God. Unlike Ps.-Solomon, moreover, he expresses unreserved admiration for Plato and philosophers of like mind, because, in his view, Plato's 0sos is one and the same as the creator god in Genesis. Philo similarly resolves the enigma of polytheism by attributing theological vacuity to Greeks and other Gentiles, and he offers an even stronger version of this argument. The worship of many gods arises from "ignorance" (cxywotcx), "being excessively unlearned" (cxpcx0tcx vTrep«cxARovoa), and from having an "absence of knowledge" (cxveTrz^Tr poouv) about God and how to honor him properly.l2 Poly- theistic people simply "do not see" (pn @XeTrovTeS) the truth of the Hellenistic Jewish teleological argument and instead elevate the world as "artifact over its artificer." Perhaps pagans in the main are incapable of learning about God, in which case they are blind where the ability to discern the true from false theology is located.l3 Alternatively, maybe they are not missing the gene for biblical monothe- ism. Pagans may simply have an incurable lack of interest in the invisible and transcendent God of Genesis, because they find him an improbable cause of the cosmos.l4 If true, then they are shamelessly mad as well as ignorant, for they openly l°For Josephus (ca. 37-100 CE), nearly all philosophers had sound notions of God that they learned from Moses, but they wisely kept such biblical monotheism out of the populace's reach (Ap. 2.168-9, 224). osephus Ap 2 250-54- l2Philo Spec.

GACA 171 prefer phenomena to the invisible God and glory in their own sophistry rather than in genuine wisdom.l5 Furthermore, Gentiles cannot possibly know God and be polytheistic by Philo's Socratic principle that one cannot possibly know the better and do the worse.l6 Therefore they can only be ignorant, given their worship of many deities. Not all pagans, however, are immersed in blind folly. Plato, the Sto- ics, and other philosophers have, with God's help, attained the enlightenment of biblical monotheism, thanks partly to tutelage from Moses.l7 Hence, like Josephus, Philo ignores the difference between pluralistic and biblical monotheism. He freely assimilates the former to the latter and thereby creates a select group of Greek philosophers who know about the biblical God. Aside from this elite, however, Gentiles have always made a muddle of theology. The Sibylline Oracles likewise support the Hellenistic Jewish argument regarding Gentile ignorance. In Sib. Or. 3.8-9 for instance, the prophetic sibyl wonders why Gentile peoples foolishly worship many gods in iconic form rather than the one great god of Genesis. Like Ps.-Solomon, Philo, and Josephus, she attributes the practice to empty-headedness and a lack of education about God's existence (rrcxvTcx . . . Acxov CXWCXI6EUTOV KEVEXpOVa). ae theologically ignorant include Babylonians, Egyptims, Libyans, Persians, Assyrians, Ethiopians, and Romans, to name a few of the peoples she upbraids for their polytheistic folly.l8 In Hellenistic Judaism, therefore, the thesis of Gentile ignorance solves the glaring discrepancy between the theory that biblical monotheism is dictated by nature itself and a social reality ffiat does not fit the para- dign. A number of Greek philosophers are at least on the right tack, and a few of them even receive honorary degrees in biblical monoffieism from Philo and Josephuls. 1111 The Argument against Polytheism in Rom 1: 18-32 Paul in Rom 1:18-32 offers a completely distinct explanation of why some or all polytheistic people in the ancient Mediterranean region worship numerous gods. The people in question are not theologically blind outsiders but something far more reprehensible in biblical terms. They are knowledgeable about God, Paul asserts, yet have become rebels who worship the created world rather than its creator. Hence, the people know but are suppressing their knowledge about God. In Paul's wording, they are blameworthy "suppressors of the truth" about God and as such they "have no defense" for worshiping their ancestral gods.l9 The possible Philo Op. mund. 45; idem Spec.

Paul advocates this new position because he recasts the teleological argument in Hellenistic Judaism into an active revelation from God to the people in question. God showed the people through creation that he is their creator, and the revelation remains part of their awareness in some sense that Paul leaves indeterminate. "That which is knowable about God is obviously in them, for God revealed it to them" (TO yVC)OTOV TOV eEOV faVEpOV EOTIV EV avTols o yap 0sos avTolS EXavEpusEv).20 The content of the revelation is the teleological argument. "God's invisible aspects are visible to the mind's eye through his works since the creation of the cosmos." Nonetheless, the truth- suppressing people have not glorified God or given him thanks even though they are so obliged since they once did recognize him and still know him in some sense. Instead, they actively exchanged biblical monotheism for polytheism under the false pretense of being wise. "They traded the glory of the imperishable God for an image of a perishable human being and of winged, four-footed, and belly-crawling creatures." In so doing "they traded in the truth of God for falsehood.''2l For Paul, therefore, Genesis is so clearly written into nature that the world undeniably beams forth its creator God's existence and his requirement of exclusive worship. The people who have suppressed their recognition of God through polytheistic mores only seem not to know him because they are in deep idolatrous denial. They have been in this blighted condition from the time they exchanged biblical monotheism for polytheistic practices. Ever since their fateful trade-off in deities, moreover, God has been punishing the people by making them deviant in their reasoning and sexual mores. The people have consequently become a society of sophists and sexual deviants, or so Paul contends. Paul's accusation in Rom 1:18-32 has a specific and technical biblical force. He boldly classifies the truth-suppressing polytheists as though they were Israel in apostasy, and not merely generic rebels against God. If, as Paul maintains in Rom 11:25-27, Israel encompasses all humanity, Jew, Gentile, and Christian alike, then the truth-suppressing polytheists are apostate Israel even though they assume this new cultural identity unawares. Paul strenuously reiterates that the people are re- bellious Israel through pointed allusions he makes to the Septuagint of Deuteronomy, Psalms, and Jeremiah. The people's polytheistic customs replicate the Israelites worshiping the golden calf at Horeb. Just as the Israelites "exchanged the glory of God for the image of a calf eating grass and forgot God who saved them" (qAAcxgcxvTo TnV sOtAV aUTSV EV OpOI@pATI po^Xou EO0OVTOS XOpTOV. EUEAG0OVTO TOU eEOU TOU scoCovTos auTous),22 so too have the truth suppressors "exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for an image" (Kal 'AAagav TnV Sogav TOU a+0apTOU oEOU EV 20Rom 1:19. 2lRom 1:23, 25. 22Ps 105: 20-21 LXX.</page><page sequence="9">KATHY L. GACA 173 ouoWcouaTW).23 Moreover, Deut 4:16-18 firmly prohibits Israel from "transgressing the law and making any and every carved image and any likeness, be it male or female, a beast that is on the earth, a winged bird that flies under the sky, or a belly- crawling creature that proceeds along the ground" (ouoWcoua apoEvTKou q 0NAUKOU . , \ , ,, , \ . , \ , , ouoWcoua rravToS KTr VOUS TCoV ovTcov EFt TllS p5, ouoWcoua rravToS OpVEOU FTEpXTOU t , . \ \ , , . , \ . .\ ., , \ o rrETaTaW U rro Tov oupavov ouoWcoua rravtoS EpUETOU, O EpWEt EFt 5 p5). None- theless, the apostate branch of Pauline Israel went ahead and did so. As Rom 1:23 puts it, they exchanged God for "the image and likeness of anthropomorphic, winged, four-footed, and belly-crawling creatures" (ouoWcouaTz ETKOVOS ¢0apTou avopco rrou Ka' rETE TVXV KaW TETparo6uv Ka' EpUETXV). The truth-suppressing people have consequently succumbed to the folly that befalls those who transgress God's will, as Jer 2:F5 and Psalm 93, in the Septuagint, indicate with more phrases that Paul borrows. "They became senseless in their acts of reasoning" (E,uaTatco0qaav EV T0t5 6WaAoylopoWs auTSv) 24 which in turn led them into polytheism and their other aberrant mores. Therefore, the senseless folly (E,uaTatco0nsav) and apostasy that Jer 2:4-5 carefully delimits to "the house of Jacob and the entire fatherland of the house of Israel" Paul transfers with breathtaking ease to polytheistic people in his Christian Israel.25 The truth suppressors must thus be summoned back to Chris- tian monotheism and its moral order, not persuaded to go there for the first time. Given the nature of Paul's accusation, the precise identity of the alleged truth suppressors becomes a pressing question whether they are humanity in its en- tirety or only some people, and if the latter, then who they are. This problem, however, remains an enigma in the text of Romans itself. As Origen astutely notes, Romans especially "uses phrases that are occasionally confused and not well ex- plicated."26 Rom 1:18 is an excellent case in point, for the truth suppressors are 23Rom 1:23. 24Rom 1:21. 25Paul's phrase "They became senseless in their acts of reasoning99 (Epavalco8qaav EV Tols slaAoylapol5 auTcov) echoes both Jer 2:4-5 and Ps 93:11 LXX.

Depending on the interpretive strategy one employs, the people's identity and the related scope of Paul's accusation vary considerably. Two alternatives humanity or Gentiles as a wholexhaust the repertoire of modern commentaries, although both interpreta- tions are open to question. By the broadest theological interpretation, Rom 1:18 delineates the human con- dition and ascribes rebellious sinfulness to everyone. This interpretation presup- poses that Romans is Paul's tract on human sinfulness, which then allows one to infer from the phrase "every irreverence and injustice of people who suppress the truth unjustly" that all people suffer from sin and suppress the truth about God in this rather general sense.27 This inference does not necessarily follow from Paul's wording. First, his concern is apostate idolatry, not generic sinfulness. Second, his statement that there are "people who suppress the truth unjustly" (avopco rrcov TCoV qv aAq0Elav EV aslKia KaTEXOVTCOV) does not commit him to the position that all people are truth suppressors in the manner depicted in Rom 1 :18-32. The univer- sal interpretation is also tenuous on historical grounds, given how openly polythe- istic and icon oriented the people are. Devout Jews and Christians in Paul's day do not fit this cultural description. If they are exempt from Paul's charge, as seems reasonable, then he did not direct his accusation at the entirety of humanity. Alternatively, the truth suppressors are only the Gentile sector of humanity at large, who did use icons in their acts of worship. Although this second interpreta- tion of the people's identity shows a clearer historical grasp of Paul's Mediterra- nean social milieu, nothing in the wording of Rom 1:18 compels this conclusion either. Paul's statement signifies that all Gentiles who are truth suppressors have the cluster of deviant mores he ascribes to them, not necessarily that all Gentiles are such suppressors of truth. These are two different propositions. Only the latter necessarily means that the people in question are all Gentiles, yet Rom 1:18 com- mits only to the former. Hence, a significant third alternative remains viable: by "truth-suppressing people," Paul may be referring to some Gentiles, not all of them. The third alternative, though invisible in modern commentaries, reflects the historically primary one offered in early Greek patristic exegesis: Rom 1:18-32 concerns Greeks either exclusively or in the main, along with their Hellenic cul- ture of philosophy, other erudition, polytheistic icon worship and homoerotic sexual vol. 1 (Freiburg: Herder, 1990). Paul was active as a Christian missionary roughly from 35-60 or perhaps a little later. On the chronology 35-60, see Koester, Early Christianity, 2. 1034. 27For example, James C.

This interpretation, though no more conclusive than the second reading, is an equal contender with it. The suppressors of truth seemed obviously Greek to Paul's earliest exegetes for the following reasons. In Rom 1 :14, the apostle unam- biguously distinguishes between "Greek and barbarian, wise and foolish" Gen- tiles. The Greeks are conceivably "the wise" as opposed to "the foolish" barbarian Gentiles. If true, as the first supporters of the Romans polemic believed, then it is redundant for Paul to belabor the obvious and explicitly name the Greeks again in his description of the so-called erudite culture in Rom 1 :18-32. The stereotypical mores that he targets in this passage indicated clearly enough to them that he had the Greeks exclusively or chiefly in mind. No other culture besides the Greeks so well fits the cluster of traits toward which the apostle directs his ire: anthropomor- phic icons, the prominence of "wise men" (oofoz) whose knowledge stems from dialectical reasoning, and openly homoerotic sexual practices. At any rate Paul's earliest exegetes thought so, regardless of whether anyone would agree with them today@28 One would be imprudent to dismiss the historically primary interpretation as impossible on the grounds that whenever Paul uses the term "Greeks" he always means Gentiles as a whole. No such synonymity holds for the crucial verse in question, Rom 1:14. There Paul directs his Gentile mission to "Greeks and barbar- ians, wise ones and foolish," which clearly differentiates Gentiles into two sepa- rate subgroups, Greek and barbarian Gentiles.29 The remaining phrase in Rom 1:14, 28The prevalence of anthropomorphism in Hellenic religion needs no proof, and zoomorphism also had its place, such as Athena as owl and Zeus as eagle. The Greeks were also well known for their subtle reasoning. "The dreadful thing about the Greeks was that they were so clever, thinking and talking twice as fast as any Roman who confronted them. Brainy Greeks, delight- ing in the exercise of proving a thesis and then, by clever argument, destroying it, were capable of proving that black was white" (J. P. V. D. Balsdon, Romans and Aliens [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1979] 33, with primary evidence 30-54). Interest- ingly, Geffcken (Zwei griechische Apologeten, 59-60) briefly interprets Rom 1:22 just as the Greek patristic writers do, though he does not develop its implications for grasping the dis- tinctive force of Paul's polemic. When discussing the trope of mocking clever Greeks who prove to be theological fools, he includes Rom 1:22 as an example of the trope "which begins with Josephus and continues in the other apologists, who are dealing almost exclusively with Greek culture" (das beginnt mit Josephus und setzt sich bei den anderen Apologeten weiter fort, die ja fast nur mit der hellenischen Kultur zu tun haben). Some of Paul's patristic ex- egetes also presumed that what is gay must be Greek (for example, Chrysostom), as I will show. On the norms behind this association, see Kenneth J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (2d ed.; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989); and William A. Percy, Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1996). 29One wonders how Paul would have gotten around in his travels and readings if he fol- lowed modern exegesis and treated the two cultural designations "Greeks" and "Gentiles" as synonymous. Stanley Stowers explicates Paul's usage thus: "He [Paul] recognizes the domi- nance of Greek culture in the Roman East by interchanging 'gentile' and 'Greek"' (A Reread-</page><page sequence="12">176 HARVARD TH EOLOG ICAL REVI EW "wise ones and foolish," leaves Paul's patristic readers free to identify the Greeks as the wise ones, which they did. On that basis they then interpreted Rom 1: 18-32 as Paul's stunning reversal and expose about Hellenic wisdom and culture. Greek reasoning, far from being genuinely wise, provoked wrongful rebellion against God, remains egregiously misleading, and has thus led Hellenic culture into per- versions. Nonetheless, in the text of Romans itself, the identity of Paul's "truth- suppressing people" remains open-ended, which likely precludes a modern con- sensus about their cultural identity. Be that as it may, the first trend in interpreting Rom 1: 18-32 is the one that matters most historically. Its effects on religious val- ues in late antiquity do not depend on whether it managed to get Paul's meaning right or would win acceptance today. Church fathers who support the Romans polemic first identify the apostate truth suppressors as Greeks exclusively or pri- marily among Gentiles and summon them back to God, as I will show below. Ancient Greek religion has not recovered since.30 Rom 1 :18-32 offers a revolution in religious ideology because Christians who support it in principle must not tolerate the peoples assigned the truth-suppressing role. Polytheistic practices are absolutely forbidden to Israel by biblical law. Re- bellious community members who worship gods other than or in addition to the Lord are brazenly in the wrong. Their practices defile the collective group and put the community at risk of suffering God's wrath. Such wrongdoers must be brought back to God in order to keep the community of believers safe and sound. Jer 2:S ing of Romans [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994] 277). In Paul's era, though,"ERAnvEs and E'0Vn were not interchangeable. The basic distinction between"ERAnvEs and E'0Vn holds true in the Septuagint. In words Paul must have known, Joel 4:2-6 foretells a gathering of a remnant of Gentiles (E'0V) before God, who are accountable for their injustice toward God's people of Israel. These Gentiles include peoples of Tyre, Sidon, Galilee, and "Greeks" ( 'ERARVES). Paul knew this text, because in Rom 10:13 he quotes Joel 3:5 LXX to support his soteriological stance that "everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved." Joel 3:5 LXX is but one verse removed from Joel 4:2-6 LXX. Similarly, Isa 66:18-19 states that there will be a gathering of all "Gentiles and tongues" (E'0Vn Kal yXOOGs) who will discover God' s glory. Some from among this diverse gathering will be sent to "Greece" as well as to other nations. Isa 9:11 and Ezek 27:13 likewise distinguish Greeks from other Gentiles. Glen W. Bowersock (Hellenism in Late Antiquity [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1990] 9-10) further suggests that "the use of Hellenic or Hellenikos in the sense of 'pagan' seems to coincide with the beginning of late antiquity, if we understand that to be the Constantinian age." If his suggestion is right, which remains an open and interesting question, then the modern day view that E'0vn and "ERAPUES are interchangeable in Paul stems from late antique exegesis of Paul. 30Despite the persecution, aspects of Greek religion nonetheless persisted here and there (such as in rural areas and towns) much farther beyond the fourth century than previously thought, for, as MacMullen puts it, "progress toward the extirpation of religious error could only be slow." Other aspects of Greek religion were reshaped for Christian purposes, which helped make the church a more civically oriented religion than it was prior to becoming a social establishment (MacMullen, Christianity and Paganism, 1-73, esp. 24).</page><page sequence="13">KATHY L. GACA 177 S issues one such summons.3l This strict religious code, however, applies only to members and to newcomers who convert and become members. Polytheistic out- siders, however, such as Greeks and other Gentiles, may be fools in terms of Hel- lenistic Jewish polemic, but they are religiously bearable fools, as long as they remain outside the covenant and do not impose polytheistic mores on the histori- cal promised land and temple precinct. If some of the theologically blind Gentiles come to follow the ways of biblical monotheism, all the better. Yet, there is no religious justification or motive for compelling them to convert and become mem- bers. The polemical argument in Romans, however, offers precisely such a justifi- cation because it reclassifies such a vaguely designated group of Gentiles as egre- giously aberrant insiders. To outlaw their deviant polytheism and return the people to God is the stance Paul's adherents must take in order to act on their conception of good faith. Rom 1: 18-32, therefore, presents nothing like a tame replica of the first polemic against polytheism, which criticizes Greeks and other Gentiles for being genuine religious aliens with little or no brain when it comes to thinking about God.32 r The Persistence of the First Argument in Early Christianity Paul's argument does not become influential immediately. It appears nowhere else in the New Testament, apostolic fathers, or the earliest Christian apologists. Apart from Rom 1 :18-32, these Christian arguments against polytheism articulate the older Hellenistic Jewish polemic in a Christian mode. Paul as a character in Acts preaches in Athens that "God set aside the times of ignorance by bringing the news [that is, the Christian gospel] to human beings." Residents of Athens had at most inchoate inklings about God. As shown by their altar to "the unknown God," the inhabitants of Athens "worship in ignorance" the god whose identity Paul knows and is trying to impart for the first time.33 In Eph 4:17-18, similarly, it is "igno- rance" about God that leads "the Gentiles to go about foolish in their mind, dark- 31Other such recalls with violent overtones include Num 25:1-9, 13; 4 Kgs 9:20-26; Isa 3:16-25; and Ezek 23:46-49. 32Scholars who have regarded Rom 1: 18-32 as a thematic replica of Wis 13: 1-14:31 have done so in one of two ways. Wisdom, despite what it says, really agrees with Romans and contends that Gentiles have renegade knowledge about God. Thus C. Larcher (Le livre de la sagesse [3 vols.; Paris: Gabalda, 1985] 3. 752) writes, "En revanche, agnosia [dans Le livre de la sagesse] doit signifier une 'meconnaissance' deliberee et fautive." Alternatively Romans, despite what it says, really concurs with Wisdom and maintains that the truth suppressors are ignorant about God. So Lagrange (Epitre aux Romains, 25), "Encore n' est-il pas necessaire de regarder cette connaissance [in Rom 1:21] comme tres explicite. Paul jusqu'ici a seulement prouve que les paiens auraient pu bien voir; ils ont vu assez pour que l'ignorance qu'il va leur reprocher ne puisse servir d' excuse." 33Acts 17:23, 30.

While Ephesians deplores the unreceptivity of Gentiles, Ignatius celebrates the conversions gained so far. Thanks to Christ, "ignorance has been put to an end" within his religious community.34 Did. 5.2 likewise supports the theory of Gentile ignorance by alluding to Genesis. People who have not yet become Christian "do not know the one who created them." Lastly, the Epistle to Diognetus contends that Gentiles and Jews alike did not know God prior to Christ's coming because Christ's intervention alone makes such knowledge attainable. "Who among human beings knew anything at all about what God is before he [the son of God] came?" All were in the dark hitherto.35 The New Testament and apostolic writings thus explain Gentile polytheism in the same terms that the Hellenistic Jewish polemicists used. Diognetus further extends the ignorance into a broadly non-Christian human condition that encompasses Jew and Gentile alike. The belief that religiously alien ignorance motivates polytheism remains in force among the early Christian apologists Aristides, Justin, Athenagoras, and Theophilus.36 Aristides classifies Gentiles into three leading ethnic divisions of in- creasingly mindless theology. Chaldaeans do not know God, Greeks are even more vacuous, and Egyptians are the most mindless of the three.37 Theophilus emphasizes the folly of the Greeks in particular. Greek writers "neither themselves knew the truth nor turned others to the truth" about God.38 "Let there be light" never illumined them, even though they were acquainted with Genesis, as indicated by their fum- bling attempts to imitate it in Hesiod's Theogony and Plato's 7imaeus. "Although they took their starting points from there [that is, Genesis] in dealing with the cre- ation of the world . . . they did not declare any chance spark worthy of the truth." Even though the poets and philosophers began their cosmologies by reading Gen- esis, the cosmologies they then produced show how poorly they understood and imitated Moses.39 Their inability to understand Moses, though, is understandable, for Greeks in the time of Hesiod and Plato had emerged from illiteracy only in the recent past, unlike the Hebrews.40 Since Hellenic culture was then somewhat new to the alphabet, their cosmogonies did not yet master the Alpha and the Omega. 34Ignatius Eph. 19.3. 35Diogn. 7.2; 8.1-11. 36References to Aristides are to the original Greek fragments from his Apology in Johannes Geffcken, Zwei griechische Apologeten. Aristidess apology, the earliest one extant, dates to the reign of Hadrian (117-138). For Theophilus (fl. ca. 169-185), see Robert M. Grant, Theophilus of Antioch: Ad Autolyoum (Oxford: Clarendon, 1970) ix-x. Athenagoras wrote Legatio ad Graecos between 176 and 180, and probably in 177. For his text consult Geffcken above.

GACA 179 Athenagoras gives the argument about Gentile ignorance its most succinct and lucid explanation. The many (oi rroRRoi) who accuse us [Christians] of atheism do not have the slightest inkling about what God is (ou6' ovap Tl EOTl oEOV EyvcoKoTE5). They are without learning and do not see (apa0ElS Kal a0EXpnTOI) natural and theological reasoning....

Theophilus, instead, tries to correct this loose identification of deities in the Greek cosmogonies with the creator god in Genesis. Justin likewise blames Gentiles for theological ignorance. Human beings have been created with the capacity to know the biblical God, as shown by the teleo- logical argument. Gentiles have never exercised this ability but instead worship multiple gods in the manner of the Greeks, Egyptians, and others.43 Justin, how- ever, finds the gods more culpable than the Gentiles themselves, for he thinks that the gods are deceptive demons who have conspired to keep pagans in the dark. The gods foiled, for instance, Socrates' monotheistic insights. Socrates wisely tried "with true reason and due inquiry . . . to draw people" toward biblical monotheism and "away from their demon gods," only to have the demons brand him an atheist and condemn him to death.44 Except for God's enlightened messenger Socrates, pagans never saw the biblical truth. Failing to see beyond the deceptive demons, they killed the messenger instead. Justin, Aristides, Theophilus, and Athenagoras, therefore, adhere to the polemic against polytheism that was dominant through the mid-second century. Pagans in the ancient Mediterranean world are foolish reli- gious aliens who never knew about God in the past.45 Socrates and Plato, however, the profoundly ancient literacy of the Yahwist creation account, which he explicates in day- by-day detail and praises to the firmament (1.6-7; 2.11-19; 3.9). 4lAthenagoras Legatio 13; 15. 42Ibid. 6. 43Justin I Apol. 28.2-3. 44Ibid. 5.1-9. 45Aristides and Justin even adapt phrasing from Rom 1: 21-23 in support of their argument about Greek and Gentile ignorance about God, "The Greeks, claiming to be wise, proved to be fools" (o, ouv EAArlvEs aofoi AEYOVTES E4val, E"copav0TloaV, Aristides 8.2).

Ps.-Solomon and Theophilus allow for no ex- ceptions. Ps-Solomon places the philosophers one step away from theological truth. Theophilus sees the cosmological poets and philosophers as Hellenic children try- ing too soon to imitate the sublimity of Moses. a The Reception of the Pauline Argument from Tatian through Chrysostom Paul's argument in Rom 1 :18-32 starts to come into its own in Tatian's Oratio ad Graecos. The new polemic thereafter gains the support of church fathers who read Romans in Greek and wrote in Greek themselves, such as Clement of Alexan- dria, Origen, Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzen, and John Chrysostom. The Romans polemic also receives the endorsement of Latin church fathers, such as Lactantius, Augustine, and Ambrosiaster,46 though my concern here is with the patristic writ- 46The bilingual Lactantius identifies the truth-suppressing people as primarily Greek and sec- ondarily as Gentiles. Augustine and Ambrosiaster identify them more generically as Gentiles. Lactantius (ca. 240-320) devotes the seven books of his lengthy Divine Institutes to the second argument that Greeks first committed apostasy from God, invented idolatry, and through this invention dragged Romans and other Gentiles down along with them: "This wickedness arose from the Greeks. Their folly, well versed in speaking proElciency and resourcefulness has it is incred- ible [to say]-- stirred up so many clouds of lies. And so the Romans, admiring them [the Greeks], first adopted their sacred rites and handed them on to all the Gentiles" (Quod malum a Graecis ortum est; quorum levitas instructa dicendi facultate et copia, incredibile est quantas mendaciorum nebulas excitaverit. Itaque [Romani] admirati eos, et susceperunt primi sacra illorum, et universis gentibus tradiderunt) (Inst. 1.15.1v15). Gentiles could be pardoned their polytheistic mores, he adds, if only their religions were based on ignorance rather than, as he believes they are, on the unforgivably suppressed knowledge about God that the Greeks Elrst started. "Nonetheless, pardon could be granted to this impiety of the people, if this error came wholly from ignorance" (Et tamen huic impietati hominum posset venia concedi si omnino ab ignorantia veniret hic error) (2.1.6). Ambrosiaster (fl. ca. 363-384) interprets Rom 1 :18-22 to mean that polytheistic peoples are guilty of treason for denying the truth they recognized and abandoning the law of nature and Moses. "To such an extent were they not ignorant (usque adeo non ignoraverunt) that they confessed there was one principle from which all things in the sky, land, and underground take their beginning . . . knowing even these things, they did not give thanks.... Rightly such people would be condemned for treason (rei maiestati)" ( 1 .18-22). In the recently edited Mayence Sermon 62, Augustine (354- 430) calls upon his brethren to accept Paul' s argument that all pagans are criminals because of their apostasy. "Look, brothers, and understand how the apostle shows that all are criminals (reos). . . Look, brothers, see how Paul does not say that the gentiles do not have truth but does say, 'they suppress truth in iniquity'.... Perhaps one of you would still ask, 'How can those who did not receive God's law have the truth?' .... 'Because that which is known of God is obviously in them. . . . For the apostle did not say, 'They do not know God,' but 'Even though they know God, they have not honored him or given him thanks"' (Mayence Sermon 62.690-97, 730-32; for which see Francois Dolbeau, "Nouveaux sermons de saint Augustin pour la conversion des paiens et donatistes (IV)," Recherches augustiniennes 26 [1992] 69-141). Augustine's zeal for this interpretation of Paul's argument resonates through his wr,itings; see Goulven Madec, "Connaissance de dieu et</page><page sequence="17">KATHY L. GACA 181 ers who wrote in Greek. The latter group, despite their somewhat free-form explications of Rom 1: 18-32, broadcast ideas that are unparalleled in the first tradition: apostates are in fact lurking among the Gentiles; their identity is Hellenic exclusively or primarily; and the Greeks' foolish wisdom reveals it- self most damningly in the philosophers who led the rebellion. Paul's mention of renegade sofoi in Rom 1:22 is what incites the polemicists to travesty phi- losophers as the leaders. Tatian, unlike his former teacher Justin, ardently supports the polemic in Rom 1:18-32. In his Oratio ad Graecos, he identifies the Greeks as the truth suppres- sors and extends Paul's charge of apostasy to include the Olympian gods as well. The teleological revelation in Rom 1:20 and its related accusation anchor Tatian's new faith in "the one sole divine ruler of the universe." "We grasp the unseen nature of his [God's] power through his works" (TnS sUVapEOS aUTOU TO aOpaTOV TOlS rroiqpaol KaTaRap,BavopE0a).47 His description of God's indirectly visible power refers succinctly to Rom 1:20: "His [God's] unseen attributes are visible to the mind's eye through his works since the creation of the world, as well as his eternal power and divine nature, so that they [the truth suppressors] are without \ \ , , , , \ , . . . excuse" Ta yap aopaTa auTou arro KTlOEOS KOOpOU TOlS FOlpaOlV VOOUpEVa Ka0OpaTal, q TE alslOS aUTOU sUVaplS Kal eElOTnS, EiS TO E4Val aUTOUS ava rroRoynTouS). Paul does not go so far as to charge that the Greek gods are also apostates without excuse. Tatian does argue this, however, because he reworks Justin's idea that the gods are deceptive demons. As go the Greeks, so go their wicked gods as apostate demons, not as mere deceivers. Once upon a time, demon angels, "their ringleader Zeus" and "people" (avOpcorrol) committed high treason against God and were expelled from sharing in his presence.48 Although Tatian uses Paul's vague term avOpco rrol to designate the truth suppressors, the people he targets are worshipers of Zeus. Hence, he identifies the apostates as the Hellenic ancestors of his Greek contemporaries. Since that time, the Greeks have led their religious lives as dupes of the rebel Olympian angels, such as Aphrodite, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, and, of course, Zeus.49 Since the gods' "insurrection" (ErravasTaolS),50 God has fallen from the Greeks' historical memory and they action de graces: Essai sur les citations de l'Ep. aux Romains 1,18-25 dans l'oeuvre de Saint Augustin," Recherches augustiniennes 2 [1962] 273-309.

The Greeks and their gods are guilty of the religious practices that they have been committing ever since the gods "threw off the reins" (a¢qvlavavTES) of God.52 Hellenes likewise "have plundered God and dishonor his creation" because they are accomplices of those "brigands of deity," the Olympians who stole bibli- cal monotheism and parceled it out among themselves.S3 Greeks and their gods, therefore, are not ignorant outsiders according to Tatian, but blindly rebellious insiders who sacked their original heritage of Christian monotheism in order to fabricate the spurious polytheism they now wrongly follow. The rebellion against God has tainted the Hellenic culture of philosophy and erudition throughout. As Paul states, the truth-suppressing sofol failed to give God thanks and instead exchanged his truth for their lie of renegade wisdom. Since the wise men are Greeks on Tatian's reading, he proudly denounces the condition of having once been a Greek by education himself.54 Having been saved from Hel- lenic culture, he now writes an expose of philosophy, the height of Greek wisdom. The philosophers who marveled at the sky and its formative principles did not make an incomplete or complete move in the right direction of biblical monothe- ism, as they do in the first polemical tradition. Rather, beginning with Thales they looked up only to fall into the pit of idolatry and other crazed products of philo- sophical thought.55 Heraclitus fittingly died caking himself with his own excre- ment, a medical procedure on a par with his philosophical ideas. Other philoso- phers are similarly vicious fools, including Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno the Stoic.56 Greek philosophers are Tatian's paragon rebels because Paul contends that falsely so-called wise men were the mad inventors of polytheistic icon worship. If Greeks are Paul's apostates, as Tatian believes, then Greek philosophical thought is at the root of the truth-suppressing evil. The sphere of Hellenic wisdom, however, ex- tends beyond philosophy to all branches of Hellenic learning.

His proud stance that he, unlike the Greeks, would rather die than be an ungrateful liar (+EuaTrls axaplaTos; 4.28-29) alludes to Rom 1:21 and 25, where Paul states that the truth suppressors ungratefully failed to give God thanks and instead exchanged God's truth for the lie of polytheism.

Hence the Greeks are unconditionally obligated to return to God, as Tatian, like a preacher, declares to them in the collective first person voice. The search that they must make is an act of "looking again" (ava(TElv) for God, not looking for the first time, because they search for "what we once had and lost, the holy spirit and union with God."s7 Therefore, the seething indignation coursing throughout the Oratio ad Graecos is not, as it has often been judged, an idiosyn- cratic fanaticism grounded in the first polemic that Gentiles are theologically ignorant outsiders. Rather, Tatian's anger breaks through the clouds because the polemic in Romans elicits his lightning against the brazen Greeks.58 Clement of Alexandria, like Tatian, exhorts the Greeks in particular to repent and be saved because he too identifies them as Paul's apostate suppressors of the truth. In his Protrepticus ad Graecos Clement clearly interprets Rom 1:18-32 to mean that Greeks must retrieve themselves from their apostate condition and go back to the Christian mode of biblical monotheism.S9 The holy apostle of the Lord accuses the Greeks (ToiJs E)\)\qvas) by saying that "even though they know God, they have refused to honor him as God or to give him thanks. Instead they became senseless in their acts of reasoning and exchanged the glory of God for an image of a human being, and they worshiped the created world instead of the creator."60 Clement's ' E)\)\PVES are the Greeks, with their Olympian gods, drama, tales, and mystery religions, not Gentiles at large.6l Clement thus sees the icons of the Greek gods not as dumb wood, marble, or bronze shaped by equally dumb makers, which is what the polemicists in the first tradition saw when they viewed them. Rather, he sees sculpted proof that the Greeks rebelliously hold God in egregious disdain. "How are you [Greeks] not irreverent?" Clement presents this rhetorical question after he links Paul's accusation with Gen 1:1. Even though, as Paul states, the 57Ibid. 16.4-6. 58Given the distinctive provocation of Tatian's polemic, it thus becomes eminently clear why "[t]he tone of [Tatian's Oratio ad Graecos] is very different from that of Justin, being a violent diatribe . . . [that] disparages the Greek philosophers [and mythology]" (Danielou, Gospel Message, 14). Similarly Quasten, Patrology, 1. 221. Tatian's anger intensifies in the face of Greeks responding with incredulity and mockery. When Greeks laugh at his thunder- ous declarations rather than running for cover, he warns that he is "the messenger of the truth" (O KnpUt TnS aAq0EiaS) that the Greeks are suppressing.

Clement traces the Greeks' disobedient reverence for the material world back to some pre-Socratic philosophers (such as Thales), whose malady of "senseless wis- dom" (asofoS soxpla) led them to posit material first principles in place of the tran- scendent god of Genesis.63 Clement diagnoses Thales and other pre-Socratics with senseless wisdom because he identiEles their ideas about the nature of the world and immanent deity with the false wisdom Paul condemns in Rom 1:22. "Claiming to be wise, they [the truth suppressors] proved to be fools" and worshiped the created world instead of God. Clement thus urges the Greeks to "abandon the old way of life, which is wicked, full of passion, and godless."64 Since pre-Socratic ideas about material first principles are wickedly forgetful rather than ignorant, leading as he thinks they did to polytheistic icons, the Greeks must undergo recovered memory and consign the pre-Socratics to oblivion. "Let us do away with, let us do away with our forgetfulness about the truth" (Trv 7\il0Tlv ms a7\Tl0Elas)! Similarly the Greeks must "run back" (lTa7\lvSpopinoTlTE) to God in heaven rather than run there for the Elrst time, just as they must seek him anew according to Tatian, for "they abandoned the straight, right path."65 These same allegations also appear in Ps.-Justin.66 To this notable extent, therefore, Clement advocates the innovative patristic view inspired by Romans, and when he advocates it he becomes strident. As Paul divulges, there are apostates in the Gentile world, and the culprits are the Greeks. In light of Rom 1:22, Clement blames the pre-Socratics in particular for dragging Hellenic culture down into polytheistic mores. Tatian, by contrast, blames all Greek philosophers for the foolish wisdom that has led the Greeks into religious deviance. Clement nonetheless vacillates in the Protrepticus on his argument that the Greeks suppressed their knowledge about God. Both polemical traditions compete for his recognition and respect.

In the Cohortatio, "Greeks" (co a\oSpEs"EAAn\*Es) are urged to defect (aTrooTi]\*al) from their wayward ancestral religions and return to primordial Christianity (35.1; 38.1). Similarly De monarchia contends that human nature once knew biblical monotheism as proven by largely forged excerpts of Greek poetry and philosophy only to abandon God for idolatry. Hence Greeks and others must "run back" (Esra\*aSpallEI\o) to their former union with God (1, 6).

GACA 185 two reasons. First, it reflects the mixed signals being brought to Christian polemics by the increasing authority of Paul's argument in Romans. Second, when Clement switches back and supports the first polemic, his disposition toward Greek philosophy improves markedly. This further indicates how the first polemic does not lead to hostility toward Greek philosophy, while that based on Romans does. In the Protrepticus, Clement occasionally reverts to the first argument that the Greeks are theologically foolish out- siders. He states, for instance, that "ignorance" is the underlying origin of Hellenic polytheism and other customs not in keeping with Mosaic law.67 Greeks unfamiliar with Christian monotheism have "ignorance" as their "pardon for the error" of their ancestral ways.68 Clement technically cannot have it both ways. The Greeks are moti- vated to be polytheistic either from ignorance or suppressed knowledge about God, but not both. When Clement maintains the former thesis, however, he adopts a more for- giving stance. Clement in the Protrepticus sirnilarly hesitates about the religious status and worth of Hellenic wisdom. Learned Greeks such as the philosophers, he later states, had inldings about the word of God, but they never fully knew him. Much as they admirably tried to think like Moses, "they did not reach their goal.'s69 This statement follows the first pb lemic as it appears in Ps.-Solomon and Theophilus, not Clement's line about the pre- Socratics' egregiously asofos sof la that he spins from Rom 1:22-23. When he supports the first polemic, moreover, he makes the Greek philosophers as a whole earnest in their worthy quest for the biblical God-and their works recommended reading for Chris- tians. This is his position in the Stromateis, which is frequently cited to show how enlight- ened the church fathers could be toward Greek philosophy. "The philosophical groups [and others] could be shown to have some share in the word of truth, some a considerable amount, others a small segment, as it happens.'° Clement's Protrepticus is, therefore, of two minds about the religious status of the Greeks and the worth of philosophy. In light of Paul, the Hellenes are intolerably rebellious insiders who should repent and condemn their natural philosophers to oblivion. In light of the first polemical tradition, however, the Greeks are forgivably ignorant outsiders who should learn, emulate, and ty to sur- pass the imperfect monotheism and first principles of their philosophers. Clement knows and tries to respect the first tradition, yet he also feels the need to honor "the holy apostle of the Lord" and the growing stature of Paul's divergent argument.7l He prefers to be of two minds in the Protrepticus rather than slight either authority. Clement later grows to favor the first polemic in the Stromuteis. This is what saves him Fom adopting the unre- lenting stance against Hellenism that Tatian takes. 67Clement Prot. 99.2; 108.1-5; see also 23.1. 68Ibid. 1 00.2. 69Ibid. 74.7. 70Clement Strom. 1.57.1-6. 71Clement Prot. 81.2.</page><page sequence="22">186 HARVARD TH EOLOG I CAL R EVI EW Origen, unlike Clement, consistently endorses Paul's idea that there are Gentile truth suppressors.72 Although he too identifies them as Greeks, he does not imag- ine that Hellenic culture as a whole is in rebellion, let alone humanity at large. Rather, as he states in Contra Celsum and his commentary on Romans, God's wrath in Rom 1: 18 strikes only those who are genuinely qualified to be truth sup- pressors: "ira dei nunc revelari dicitur non . . . in omnes homines, sed in illos solos, qui veritatem dei in iniquitate detinent." They belong to the Greek intellectual elite, "those who are wise and learned about this world or philosophers."73 Like Tatian and Clement, Origen locates the rebellion in Greek philosophy, arguing that "Paul, who is a lover of the truth, says about some Greek sages, that they knew God wherein what they say is true . . . and he bears witness that they knew God."74 The Greek sages, however, abandoned God, as Origen further testiEles in light of Roml:19-23. We bear true witness about some Greek philosophers, that they knew God "since God revealed it to them" even though "they did not glorify or give him thanks as God, but became senseless in their reasoning. Claiming to be wise, they proved to be fools, and they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the image of a perishable human being, winged, four-footed, and belly-crawling creatures."75 Since their transgression happened "not in ignorance, but with knowledge about the truth" (non in ignorantia sed in scientia veritatis), they are without excuse, just as Paul states.76As Origen says in Comnz. in Rom. 17.144.&gt;10, Though they knew God from his revelation, they did not honor or give him thanks as was fit, but through the vanity of their own thoughts they sought forms and images in God, wasted God's image on them- selves, and fell into the deep dark depths of stupidity even though they seemed to boast that they were in the light of wisdom. Therefore Paul's "accusation of impiety" (crimen impietatis) has rightly exposed them.77 Origen screens the Greek philosophers to see which ones Paul rightly accuses of suppressing the truth. In his lineup of suspects are all those who have dealt with physics and metaphysics. They are the ones "whose discipline it is to engage in disputations about created things of the world and all things made in it, and then, 720rigen lived ca. 185-253.

For Origen, philosophers with no transcendent god never attained any truth to suppress, as indicated by their wild ideas that God is strictly immanent, physically grounded, and as such susceptible to mutability. Hence their limited thought pertains only to "the wisdom of the cosmos" (oobla Tov KOOpOV) as opposed to that of God (oobla oEOV) beyond the phenomenal world. The Stoics are Origen's primary example of such materialistic philosophers. As their physical logos shows, they shamelessly envisioned God as a material substance subject to change and to corruption.79 Thus the Stoics "were unable to clearly perceive the natural idea about God, which is that God is imper- ishable, simple, uncompounded, and indivisible."80 By the same token, Origen would presumably reverse Tatian's and Clement's condemnation of pre-Socratics such as Thales, for their conceptions of deity are similarly immanent and physical. As far as Origen is concerned, Clement has identified the wrong philosophers as the truth-suppressing culprits and Tatian is far too indiscriminate in condemning all of them. Although many Greek philosophers are called, Origen chooses few to know God. The chosen ones who recognize the one supreme and transcendent God in- clude Plato and the Platonic Socrates.8l These two philosophers correctly teach that God exists in his kingdom of forms. Plato, when he elucidates the primary good, offers the same truth abstrusely as Matthew, John, Psalms, and Isaiah do more simply and accessibly in their insights into the light of the blessed.82 Further- more, God of Genesis in his ultimate being is "colorless, shapeless, impalpable," just as Socrates observes in Phaedr. 247c6-7. Accordingly, philosophers such as Plato and Socrates have known the one and only God beyond the phenomenal world.83 Origen here is expressing the same viewpoint as the one advocated in the first tradition by Philo, Josephus, Athenagoras, and Justin. In light of Rom 1:22-23, however, Origen has grounds to suspect that Plato and Socrates are chief among the philosophers Paul condemns. Upon completing his investigation, he overturns the honor accorded to Plato, Socrates, and like-minded 78Ibid. 17. 142. 19-22. 790rigen Cels. 1.21; see also 3.47. 80Ibid. 4.14; see also 6.71. 8l0rigen simply identified the Platonic Socrates with Socrates the historical figure. Origen's other truth-suppressing philosophers would include Greek thinkers in Numenius's now lost On the Good, a section of which surveyed true Gentile ideas about the bodiless God. Origen approves of Numenius's survey (Cels. 1.15). Heretics are also truth suppressors (Comm. in Rom. 161.23-162.1). 820rigen Cels. 6.5. 83Ibid. 6.19; 6.4.</page><page sequence="24">188 HARVARD TH EOLOG I CAL REVI EW philosophers in the first tradition. By Origen's reading of Paul, God's chosen few philosophers stand accused of exchanging the truth about God for the lie of polytheism. To his dismay, as he combs Plato's dialogues to verify the charge, he catches Plato and Socrates in the act numerous times. Socrates in the Phaedo truly expounds the soul's trials in its ascent toward the biblical God. Then, how- ever, he does just as Paul claims and abandons the truth at the end of the dia- logue, where he drivels deceptively about sacrificing a cock to Asklepios.84 Even worse, the Republic begins with the descent to the Piraeus, where Socrates and Plato commit overt treason against God by attending an inaugural religious fes- tival in honor of Artemis and praying to her.85 Clearly, then, God's few enlight- ened philosophers are brazenly without excuse, for they knowingly promote re- ligious falsehood to the Greeks rather than making their crooked ways straight.86 Their collusion even infects their metaphysical teachings. Plato lapses into idola- trous denial when he states in Tim. 41a6-7 that God is the craftsman and father of the gods.87 Likewise the devil himself, "the prince of this realm," must have driven Plato to write in Phaedr. 250b7-8 that the souls of the purest departed philosophers "are with Zeus, while others are with other divinities (6aipovEs), some with one, others with another." Through such dead giveaways Plato will- fully "corrupted right reverence with idolatry and superstition."88 Origen accord- ingly condemns the Greek philosophers who are honored for their theology in the first polemical tradition, Plato and Socrates foremost. They cease being he- roic pagan visionaries with shining monotheistic insights and instead become glowing fallen angels destined for retribution. "We say that those who have both understood the true things about God and have not exercised a reverence of God worthy of the truth about him are subject to the punishment of sinners."89 There is an element of Greek tragedy here, to see the best of the Christian Platonists surrender Plato and Socrates as religious traitors to Paul the lover of truth. There is also a touch of comedy that was no laughing matter for Origen, worthy as it would be of Aristophanes. Socrates goes down once more, condemned yet again, this time because of the chicken. Athanasius follows and elaborates Rom 1:18-32 with unswerving loyalty in Contra gentes, and he takes it as a major statement about Hellenic and Mediterra- nean culture. He esteems Paul as the "holy interpreter of God's truth, . . . the holy 84Ibid. 6.4. 850rigen identifies Glaukon as Plato, and he similarly identifies the Thracian goddess Bendis as Artemis, whose inaugural ceremony is mentioned in the opening of the Repub- lic. 860rigen Cels. 6.3-4 87Ibid. 6.10. 88Ibid. 8.4; 6.17. 89Ibid. 6.3.</page><page sequence="25">KATHY L.

The apostasy that Paul describes in Romans is a second fall from God. Greeks and other Gentiles are the ones who lapse into natural philosophy and polyffieism, and the Greeks are primarily to blame for fomenting the rebellion and spreading it to other Gentile peoples. In Athanasius's tale, once upon a time sometime after the fall of Adam and Eve and before the coming of Christ- the "people" (avOpcoTrol) of Romans 1:18 regained enough ground in theology that they once again inferred the invisible God from his six-day work of creation. Romans provides all the cru- cial evidence Athanasius needs. "I say this not on my own authority, but on the basis of what I have learned from the men of theology, among whom is Paul, who writes as follows to the Romans, 'God's invisible aspects are visible to the mind's eye through his works since the creation of the cosmos'.''9l Theological progress came naturally to humanity descended from Adam and Eve, for nature by design virtually proclaims Genesis. "Knowledge about revering God and the truth of the universe ... all but shouts every day in the [world's] works.... Creation itself practically cries out and demonstrates its creator and maker, God the ruler of all and father of our Lord Jesus Christ."92 Despite nature's deafening clarity, the "people" once again fell away from God, this time to contrive polytheistic idolatry and its deviant sexual ways, just as Ro- mans states. The first people are the Greeks.93 To underscore the enormity of their religious rebellion, Athanasius reinterprets Wisdom's argument that "the discov- ery of idols is the corruption of life."94 Again, for Ps.-Solomon, the discovery of 90Athanasius Gent. 26.8-9; 35.18-20. Athanasius lived 295-373. For references see Rob- ert w.

The people are 44crazed persons among human beings in the days of old (oi TraAal TCOV avOpcoTrcov TrapafpovEs) whose madness led them to contrive polytheistic mores (8.26-28). The crazed people in question belong to the Gentile sector alone: 44In the preceding part (that is, in Contra gentes) we have narrated sufficiently a few of the many things about the error and superstition of Gentiles (TCOV E0VXV) about idols, such as their original invention of idols (Incarn. l.1-4). Finally, in this Gentile sector, the Greeks are the original inventors of polytheistic idolatry. 4The Greeks cut themselves off from the truth through devising the worship of numerous gods. since then the Greeks have become corrupted sexually and oth- erwise, and other Gentiles have followed suit (ibid. 29.47-8; see also 26.8-19; 29.37-40). According to Athanasius, therefore, the Greeks originally provoked the apostasy among them- selves. Then the rebellion spread to other Gentiles. Greeks are thus primarily to blame for the polytheistic alienation from God, as reported in Rom 1:18-32. 94Athanasius Gent. 9.48; 11.1-3.</page><page sequence="26">190 HARVARD TH EOLOG I CAL REVI EW idols is rooted in religiously alien ignorance or KEvologia. Athanasius recasts this discovery so that it becomes the second deliberate fall from God that Paul narrates in Romans.95 On this occasion, a particularly mad group of Gentiles, the Greeks, suc- cumbed to pleasure in their souls. As a result they once more "forgot the idea and view about God," and then they contrived polytheistic corruption in their collective soul.96 "The soul, teeming with every kind of fleshly appetition . . . finally fashioned in bodily and visible ways God whom it had forgotten in its thought, attributing the name of God to phenomena and glorifying these alone as it wishes and sees as plea- surable."97 With their minds thus darkened,98 the Greeks led other Gentiles into apos- tasy in precisely the manner Paul describes. Their Gentile mind "leapt away from God" into the pltch-dark depths of their own theological devices.99 Hellenic culture is especially to blame among Gentiles because the Greeks first "cut themselves off from the truth" and flagrantly "deny God." Hence, "the Greeks must not make any excuses (pn TrpobaTl(EsOcovav "EARNVES) in defense of worshiping idols." They have only themselves to blame for their indefensible alliance with Zeus, Aphrodite, and other Olympian gods. "If they had consulted the mind of their soul, they would not have fallen entirely headfirst into such practices and denied the true God, the father of Christ," which they manifestly did.l°° Athanasius chiefly blames philosophers with material first principles for lead- ing the Greeks and other Gentiles over the polytheistic edge. He also finds room to blame Plato and Socrates as well in light of Origen's argument. Athanasius groups the natural philosophers together as "falsely so-called sages" (6oKsisobol) be- cause he identifies them as the ones who "became senseless while claiming to be wise" (+aOKOVTES ElVal O°+°i l EpXpaV0qUaV) in Paul's polemic in Rom 1:22. "The falsely so-called sages reject God the father of Jesus Christ, yet they bow down to and deify his creation.''l°l The natural philosophers rejected God by grounding deity strictly in the cosmos, as the Stoics do. "The falsely so-called sages will say that the universe is God . . . [and] is adequate and sufficient unto itself in all re- spects.''l02 This particular conception of deity and the phrasing used to describe it stems from Chrysippus and other Stoics.l03 Athanasius finds it shocking even to ssIbid. 11.2-23; 7-33-36 96Ibid. 8.26-28. 97Ibid. 8.14-18. 98Athanasius uses Pauline imagery about darkened thoughts, minds, and perception in Gent. 7.18-23; 8.33-34; 9.5-6; 9.21-22.

Most drop like the stones they come to worship. Their increasingly corrupt sequence of gods reveals their rela- tive states of theological decline. First comes the worship of the universe, with its stars, planets, and related astral forces, and then gods depicted as ether and air. Pagans at this level, such as the natural philosophers, revere creation and no longer hear nature's outcries about God's transcendence. 105 The majority of pagans plunge even deeper into polymorphous perversity: anthropomorphic icons of men, aniconic stones and wood, crawling creatures, fantastic creatures, icons of sexual desire and pleasure, emperor worship, boy worship by emperors, and lastly immedi- ately before pagans descend into a coma about God the father and son anthropo- morphic icons of women. "If only the madness for idols had stopped with males and did not pitch downward to the point of addressing the divine name to females ! Yes, even women, who cannot be trusted even in public affairs, even women they honor and revere with the glory due God!''l06 Athanasius thus Elnds the Piraeus incident of religious treason especially shocking. When "Socrates and Plato went down to the Piraeus," they were not merely leaders in betraying God, as already shown by Origen. They were also helping inaugurate a festival to honor the lowest of the low, one of those woman gods.l07 Greeks and other Gentiles, since their second fall, are now all in the truth-suppressing condition that Paul delineates. They exchanged their inferential knowledge about God for the retributive condi- tion of polytheism that they pass off as a bona fide religious heritage.'08 Formerly polytheistic Christians, Greek and barbarian alike, therefore must never again fall for Greek philosophical conceptions of deity. They need only look to Paul, as it. It is both nurtured and will grow from itself, with parts transferring into one another" (Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, ed.

Athanasius refuses to envision God in the form of a woman partly because God the father and son faced such powerful competition from cults in honor of feminine deities, such as Demeter the mother and her daughter Persephone in the Eleusinian Mysteries. Among gods "on the female side," he explicitly mentions the Greek gods Demeter, Persephone, Athena, Artemis, Hera, Aphrodite, and the Hellenized Egyptian deity Isis (10.5, 15-16). l08Athanasius both paraphrases and quotes Paul on this point. "They have been abandoned by God's surrendering of them" (TlApa6O0EVTES EV Tw arosTpa+8qval TOV oEOV auTous). So too Paul, as directly quoted by Athanasius: "God handed them over to dishonoring passions" (TlApE6XKEV aUTOUS O oEOS EiS wa0q aTIplaS) (Gent. 19.16-20; Rom 1:26).</page><page sequence="28">192 HARVARD THEOLOG I CAL REVI EW Athanasius does, to learn about the blight that struck them the first time they fell for immanent and pluralistic notions of God. Christians, instead, must always re- member that "the Greeks tell mythology, not theology," just as we see in the web that Athanasius spins from Romans. l09 John Chrysostom outstrips even Athanasius in ardently supporting Rom 1 :18- 32. In his Homilies on the Letter to the Romans,ll° Paul is his definitive theologian. "Let us open our eyes," he writes, "to the light of the apostle's words so as not to proceed in the most impenetrable darkness, for indeed his tongue shone more brightly than the sun.''lll On Chrysostom's reading, Rom 1:18-27 singles out the Greeks alone for being renegades against God. Only in Rom 1:28-32 does Paul broaden his cultural scope with the list of vices pertaining to all Gentiles. "Paul, it seems to me, i$ referring to Greeks" ( 'EARNVES) as the recipients of God's punitive wrath in narrative starting atRom 1:18.ll2 The vice list in Rom 1:28-32 deals more generically with the sins of "other persons" ('ETEpa rrposcoTra), namely, Gentiles (E0m) in addition to the Greeks.ll3 Chrysostom thus explicates Rom 1:18-27 against 'EARNVES in no loose sense of the word.ll4 He means Hellenic culture. As Chrysostom clearly recognizes, apostasy is the formal charge being made in Rom 1: 18-27. Paul accuses the Greeks of "the abandonment of God" (q TOV oEOV EyKaTaREzZls).ll5 This accusation of apostasy is made with Septuagintal phrasing. In key passages of the Greek Bible, the verb EyKaTaREiTrEIv signifies that God's people have abandoned the covenant in order to worship other gods.ll6 According l09Athanasius Gent. 19.34-35. Hence Thomas-Pierre Camelot (Athanase d'Alexandrie, Contre les paiens [Paris: Cerf,1947] 34,136) is mistaken to regard Athanasius's argument as a boring replica of the standard Hellenistic Jewish and early Christian polemic against poly- theism. "Il faut reconnaltre qu'il [Athanase] n'a guere cherche a renouveler une matiere cent fois traitee depuis des siecles . . . des longtemps traditionelle dans le judaisme." ll°References to Chrysostom (b. ca. 349-354, d. 407) are to Homiliae in epistulam ad Romanos. My citation numbers indicate the homily and section number in the readily acces- sible PG 60, followed by the PG section number and more specific marginal letter in the far less accessible Homiliae in epistulam ad Romanos (Oxford: Parker, 1849). Chrysostom Hom. in Rom. preface 1. Ibid. 3.1, 448e. 3Ibid. 5.1, 460b. 114Chrysostom further explicates his position that the accused in Rom 1: 18-27 are Greeks rather than Gentiles at large. For example, God' s revealed wrath in Rom 1: 18 pertains to "the Greek" in Rom 1:18-27 and to "the unfaithful" at large in Rom 1 :28-32 (Hom. in Rom. 3.1, 448b). This phrasing distinguishes Greeks as a subset among the unfaithful Gentiles as a whole. In a more elaborate but substantively similar vein, Chrysostom states that Rom 1: 18- 32 as a whole pertains to "Scythian, barbarian . . . and Greeks" (Hom. in Rom. 3.2,449e). Here, too, the Greeks have to be Greeks and not Gentiles in general. l l5Chrysostom Hom. in Rom . 4.1, 455c. ll6In Deuteronomy, for instance, Moses as the voice of God states that the denizens of Israel "have provoked me with their religiously alien ways; they have embittered me with their abominations.

He eluci- dates Paul's accusation by citing Jer 2:13 to explain Rom 1:21. To Paul's, "though they know God, they have refused to honor him or give him thanks as God," he adds Jeremiah's indictment: "They worshiped idols, just as Jeremiah said in this accusa- tion, 'This people (o Caos oVTos) has done two wicked things. They abandoned (EyKaTERI rrov) me, the fountain of living water, and they dug for themselves broken cisterns'.''ll7 In Chrysostom's mind, however, o Caos ovTos in Jeremiah breaks from its historical grounding (Jews in the late seventh or early sixth century sCE) and incorporates the Greeks. He gains warrant for making the transfer given the cultural identity he gives to Paul's truth-suppressing people. Who are Paul's avOpcoTrol ? They are "this people," the Greeks. Hence, like Jeremiah's audience, so too have the Greeks shamelessly turned away from God the fountain in favor of polytheistic drought. Chrysostom astutely grasps that Paul is making "an enormous accusation" (EyKAqpa pEyloTov),ll8 not some tepid rendition of the Hellenistic Jewish polemic with which the apostle was familiar in the mid-first century. Chrysostom also commends Paul's verbal fire for being well placed under Hellenic culture and leaps ardently to fan the flames. The Greeks are guilty of "abandoning the fear of God," and of "dismissing God" altogether.ll9 To understand the motives for his zeal, we need to explore his understanding of Paul's teleological revelation. Chrysostom urgently endorses Paul's position that the teleological argument is a revelation to all Gentiles, not only to the Greeks. God of Genesis exists, as everyone undeniably knows from the world he designed in six days. All Gentiles know God, therefore, but only the Greeks committed apostasy. Chrysostom emphasizes this point by writing, "How is it clear, Paul, that God implanted knowledge [about himselfl in the Greeks? Because, as Paul says, 'Knowledge of God is manifestly in them'." Chrysostom then urges the apostle to prove the assertion that the Greeks are in rebel- lion. "Paul, get ready and demonstrate that knowledge of God was clearly in them [the Greeks] and that they willingly ran away. How was it clear to them?''l20 As ostensible proof, Chrysostom simply restates Paul's teleological revelation in such a way as to make the Greeks more stupid than barbarians if they deny the veracity of Paul's assertion: Recent innovations have come, which their fathers did not know. You abandoned (EyKaTEXIGES) God who gave birth to you and you forgot God who nurtures you" (Deut 32:16- 18). Jeremiah in the voice of God similarly states, "I will speak to them [the inhabitants of Judah] in condemnation of their wickedness, because they abandoned (EyKavE'XIxrov) me, made sacrifices to alien gods, and bowed low to the works-of their own hands" (Jer 1 :16). Chrysostom's own phrase rl vou eEOU EyKaTaXEI+15 in Hom. in Rom. 4.1, 455c picks up and refers back to his quotation of Jer 2:13 in Hom. in Rom. 3.2, 450b. Chrysostom Hom. in Rom. 3.2, 450b.

Chrysostom thus gives the Greeks one of two choices. They must either admit that they have known God all along, or else they shamefully lose face to the barbarians, who learned about God at the same time as the Greeks. "So then, what will the Greeks say on that day [of judgment], that 'we did not know you, God,' merely because you did not hear a voice from heaven" making the proper announcement?l21 Therefore, "God set forth the cosmos as a form of religious teaching in our midst," so that all Gentiles, Greeks and barbarians alike, know God and are obliged to fear him and follow his laws.l22 Although all Gentiles know God, only the Greeks had the intellectual audacity and innovative spirit to become polytheists. This crucial move in Chrysostom's interpretation turns on Paul's declaration in Rom 1:23, 25 that the truth suppres- sors "traded" (ilARatav) God for idols and thereby "traded in" (pEXatAV) God's truth for a lie. The Greeks "traded" (qARatav) their knowledge of God for polythe- istic ways because of their penchant for intellectual innovation. "They wanted to discover something more, rather than remaining within the ordained limits. In this way they fell away from the limits, for they lusted after new ideas (K0(lVOTOplG)- all such traits are characteristically Greek ones.''123 If only Hellenic culture were not so trendy, the Greeks would never have forsaken the religious fountain of their ancestors, "the one God, the Lord of all, the one who created them from nothing, God with providence and mercy.''124 The religious problem of the Greeks, however, runs far deeper than setting new trends. The Greeks fell into rebellion because of their deep trust in the power of reasoning and the discipline of the mind. "Paul establishes the cause through which they fell into such great folly. They trusted entirely in their acts of reason" (TOlS Coylopols).125 Plato and Socrates, furthermore, are the main philosophers to blame Ibid. 3.2, 449d-e. Ibid. 3. 3, 45 2b . 123Chrysostom here uses the stereotype of Greek intellectuals in Acts 17 to explain why the Greeks exchanged God for false gods. "All the Athenians and foreigners dwelling in their city like nothing more than to say or to listen to something new" (vI KalvovEpov) (Acts 17:21). Homoeroticism as described in Rom 1:26-27 is central among the new ideas for which the Greeks yearned. "Legitimate pleasure is in accordance with nature. But when God abandoned (EyKaTaxiTrn) them [the rebellious Greeks], everything down became up, and up down" (through homoerotic practices) (Hom. in Rom. 4.1, 454d). Chrysostom Hom. in Rom. 3.3, 451c. 125Ibid. 3.2, 450c Here Chrysostom alludes to Paul's statement in Rom 1:21 that the truth suppressors "became senseless in their acts of reasoning" (vols SlaRoylopols).</page><page sequence="31">KATHY L. GACA 195 for stimulating such trust in reason. Like Origen, Chrysostom brandishes the Socratic chicken to silence the view that Greek philosophers are honorably inclined toward biblical monotheism. "This Socrates of yours was the one who ordered that a cock be sacrificed to Asklepios.''126 According to Chrysostom, therefore, only those Greeks, and their philosophers especially, could have invented polytheistic icon worship in flagrant disobedience of God, for only they believed in and fostered human reason. Christians, accordingly, must never again value rationality and its trends more than the recovery of Christian doctrine from their suppressed memory. Reason on its own is insubordinate and leads to many gods. Chrysostom finds the apostasy of the Greeks written right into their language. As Paul rightly detects, the Greeks let slip unawares that they know the biblical God. Whenever they use the word OEoS in the singular or plural, this surface ex- pression reveals their submerged memory of him. "As a sign that they know God (Ei6EVAI TOV oEOV) and are not using this knowledge as they should, Paul brings in this point, that they know gods (TO oEOVS EyVOKEVG1).''127 Whenever the Greeks use the holy word oEOS in the singular or plural, their choice of vocabulry itself con- fesses that there is no God but God, try as they may to pretend otherwise. Chrysostom tells parables to drive home his invective against the apostate Greeks. First, a royal treasurer takes the king's wealth entrusted to him and wastes it on thieves, whores, and magicians.l28 Thus are the Greeks, who have squandered their knowledge of God upon Olympians and other false gods. Second, a king's son dishonors his father and instead keeps company with thieves, murderers, and tomb robbers.l29 Likewise, the Greeks have dishonored God the father and creator through their truth-suppressing innovation of "worshiping the created world" in place of the creator.130 Just as the king leaves his rebellious son in bad company in order to teach him a hard lesson, God has abandoned his Greek children to the lawless and low-life gods of their own devising. The son, of course, must repent and return to his father. So, too, must the Greeks make a Hellenic exodus from their Olympian penal colonies. Chrysostom is not alone in seeing Greek religion as a kind of peni- tentiary. Gregory Nazianzen similarly views Hellenic religion as a penal system brought about by God punishing the truth-suppressing Greeks for their rebellion.l31 l26Chrysostom Alom. in Rom. 3.3, 451d. Chrysostom's strong disdain for Greek philosophy follows from his Pauline polemic against philosophers. He "attacks the philosophers for trying to subvert Christian doctrine," no philosopher more so than Plato (Paul R. Coleman-Norton, "St. Chrysostom and the Greek Philosophers," CP 25 [1930] 305-6, 311). Chrysostom Alom. in Rom. 3.2, 450b-c. Ibid. 3.2, 449b. 9Ibid. 3.3, 452c. 30Ibid. 3.4, 452d-e.

The exact identity of this people remains open-ended in Romans. The church fathers who wrote in Greek, however, identify the truth suppressors as exclusively or primarily Hellenic. This is historically the first of three conflicting ideas about the people's identity. Paul's argument is unusual because he recasts the Hellenistic Jewish teleological argument into an undeniable revelation from God and asserts that the revelation is known to the people in question. He also redefines humanity in general as the new Israel, which he takes as license to transfer Septuagintal passages about rebellious Israel to the allegedly truth-suppressing people. Paul thereby radically reclassifies their polytheistic culture as an unbear- ably apostate one. Before, during, and for a century after Paul lived, the Hellenistic Jewish and early Christian polemicists continued to attribute polytheism to ignorance. They classified Gentiles, including the Greeks, as religious outsiders who neither recog- nized nor had any affiliation with the biblical God, and never did. This argument is revisionist to the extent that it reclassifies natural law in Greek philosophy as Pentateuchal law and interprets the numerous projects of Greek philosophical and other rituals, such as the Eleusinian mysteries and worship of Dionysus, Aphrodite, and Apollo at Delphi (39.4-5). "Just as Paul states," Greek religious practices are "'the recom- pense their practitioners had to take for their error (gXaV)' in their acts of reverence." Hence the practices are "wickedly possessed in all respects," for the participants "were taken down into the worship of idols" ever since "they fell away (axroxrEvElv) from the glory of God." The people too "are an abomination (E6EXUKTOI) because of their error." In fact, "they are even more of an abomination (T6EXUKTOTEpOI) than the worthless nature of the objects they worship since they are even more insensible than the revered objects" (ibid. 39.6). B6E'XUypa iS a technical term in the Septuagint referring to that which is repellent to God and prohibited to his people by his law. Gregory is not merely attacking the outre side of Greek rituals, such as running wild with Dionysus, for seeming indecency is not what provokes him. Gregory is outraged at Greek religion for reasons that would baffle both the Pentheus-minded and the wearers of dappled fawn skins alike: Greek rituals one and all reflect the primordial rebellion and punitive condition of Christian Israel. The Greeks would need catechism in Romans to understand this charge, as Gregory's own homily shows. "Since we did not deem it worthy to keep the law (KaecoS OUK E6OKIpadapEV fuXagAl TnV EVTOV), we were handed over (IrapE6oErpEv) to our self-regulated error (gXaVnS). Since we were led astray, we were dishon- ored through our objects of worship (qTlpad0q"Ev EV O15 EdEad0q"EV) (39.7). Gregory s confession of collective Hellenic guilt reflects point for point Paul's accusation in the third person plural. "Since they [the truth suppressors] did not deem it worthy to keep God in recognition (Kai Kaecos OUK E6oKi padaV TOV eEOV EXE IV EV E GlyV;dE I), God handed them over (IrapE6coKEv auvouS) to a corrupted state of mind" (Rom 1:28), to punitive religious practices in penalty for their error (llXaV), and to the attendant dishonor (avlpa(EsEal) that defiles the body through polytheistic reasoning and homoerotic sexual conduct (Rom 1:24, 26-27).

GACA 197 monotheism as a search for biblical monotheism, with a few lucky hits by Plato, Socrates, and other philosophers. Its revisionism is smaller in scope than Paul's polemic. Proponents of this more original view include Ps.-Solomon, Josephus, Philo, and the Sibyl, the authors of Acts, Ephesians, and the Didache, as well as Aristides, Theophilus, Athenagoras, Justin, and Clement in the Stromateis. Paul's argument in Romans remained uninfluential until the later second cen- tury. Beginning with Tatian's Oratio ad Graecos (ca. 176), various patristic writ- ers start to hoist Paul's argument through their exegesis and unfbrl some of the most striking banners of revisionist history brought to us from antiquity.l32 The Greeks are transformed into apostates who deElle themselves through their philo- sophical reasoning, icon worship, and homoerotic sexual relations. They drag other Gentiles down along with them, according to Athanasius and Lactantius. Hellenic or Gentile culture as a whole consequently needs to be summoned back to God and purified of such practices. Proponents of this argument include Tatian, Clement in sections of the Protrepticus, Ps.-Justin, Origen with regard to particular Greek philosophers, Athanasius, Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen, and John Chrysostom. The different tenor of the two arguments against polytheism shows up espe- cially well in the respective stature each accords to Greek philosophy. In the origi- nal polemical tradition, the outright vilification of philosophers and philosophy is absent. Instead, this tradition expresses admiration for philosophers who have found the biblical God or reasonable disagreement with the Jewish and Christian admir- ers who assert that the Platonic or Stoic God is the same as the God of the Greek Bible. According to Ps.-Solomon and Theophilus, Greek philosophers at least make an effort to attain biblical monotheism, though their handicap of Gentile ignorance proves insurmountable. According to Philo, Josephus, Athenagoras and Justin, phi- losophers of Plato's and Socrates' caliber heroically overcome their Gentile disad- vantage and hobble all the way to the biblical God thanks partly to Moses' tute- lage. Polemicists starting from Rom 1 :18-32, by contrast, are incited and obliged by Paul's argument to attack Greek philosophers and their ideas, for they desig- nate philosophers as the leaders of the cabal seeking to suppress the truth about God. The philosophers they target for blame change like Proteus-all of them, the l32As Glen W. Bowersock vividly states (Fiction as Alistory: Nero to Julian [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994] 1-2), "[T]he second century of our era . . . [was] a world in which the boundaries between creative imagination and willful mendacity, between fiction and lying, often proved impossible to determine.... The problem ... acquired a special urgency [in the second century] because apparent Elctions about both past and present were proliferating at a rate that the classical world had scarcely seen before.... History was being invented all over again; even the mythic past was being rewritten." His comment concerns once local legends about heroes that undergo reshaping and broadening, yet it is eminently apropos for the method used by Paul and his patristic supporters to reinvent the culture of apostate Israel in Greek and Gentile lands.</page><page sequence="34">198 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW pre-Socratics, the Stoics, Plato, Socrates, or some combination thereof. The po- lemicists believe, in response to Rom 1:21-23, that Greek sofol fathered the reli- gious rebellion Paul denounces, which is why Greek philosophers always remain the opponent to wrestle and pin down. The most striking example of the difference between the two arguments is Origen's radical demotion of Plato's and Socrates' stature: They are biblical monotheists, as claimed by Philo and others in the origi- nal argument, but traitors to the cause in light of Romans. Plato and Socrates, even though they knew God, went down to the Piraeus to inaugurate more idolatry. Rom 1 :18-32 is but a page long in the New Testament and is anomalous regard- ing the status of Greek and other polytheistic religions. Nonetheless, unlike the po- lemical tradition that came before it, the Romans inspired polemic produced a heady ideology conducive to helping reshape the MeditexTanean region into a Christian society. Paul's argument prompts the forbidding and outlawing of whatever reli- gions his supporters deem false and whatever customs they find integral to the apos- tasy. Hellenic culture is at the forefront of the patristic invective spearheaded by Romans, along with its customs of Greek philosophy and homoerotic sexual rela- tions. The more Paul becomes Christ's theologian par excellence, Romans his de- finitive tract, and his supporters as prominent as Athanasius, Chrysostom, and Au- gustine, the greater this potential for biblically motivated intolerance becomes. By contrast, the initial polemical tradition regarding ignorant religious outsiders allows Hellenistic Jews and early Christians to disapprove of, yet uneasily tolerate, the reli- gious mores of their pagan neighbors. Mere theological fools and religious aliens may be left to their own rituals and other cultural practices, so long as they do not try to impose them on God's adherents. Pagans might see the light of pure monotheism one day, but the bearers of that light do not have a compelling biblical motive to pursue them and close down their temples, as they do in light of Rom 1:18-32.l33 The increasing authority of the Romans polemic did not, in all likelihood, single- handedly motivate Christian intolerance toward pagan religion in the Roman Em- pire. Further study is consequently needed in order to grasp the complex historical relationship between the rise of this polemic and the social demise of the Greek and other pagan gods. What I have shown in this article is that the Romans po- lemic functions as an apostate conspiracy theory, wildly untrue and potent as such theories characteristically are. The further study to be done should concern pre- cisely how the theory relates to the development of Christian intolerance in the late fourth century. l33Justin's concluding appeal to the Roman senate exemplifies this more tolerant stance. "But if you publicize this treatise, we will make it available to all, so that, if possible, they may change their minds. For this was our sole purpose in composing these words.... We will not pursue the matter further, having done what was in our power, with our prayers that all people everywhere may be found worthy of the truth" (2 Apol 15 2-9).</page></plain_text>
