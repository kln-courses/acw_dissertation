<plain_text><page sequence="1">KATERINA SYNODINOU / IOANNINA The Threats of Physical Abuse of Hera by Zeus in the Iliad The generally hostile and antagonistic relationship between Zeus and Hera in the Iliad is well known and several scholars have advanced various explanations of its character. In this relationship the threats of physical abuse of Hera by Zeus is an important element which has been accepted, it seems, as something taken for granted which does not seem worthy of special explanation or attention. Zeus and Hera, the divine couple itself, respond to it in the same way. My approach, however, will focus on this aspect of their relationship and especially on its effect on Hera. From this point of view I will attempt to throw some light on the marital behaviour of the divine couple, which by extension may, to a degree, qualify certain interpretations of the relationship between Zeus and Hera as a whole. On three occasions Zeus threatens physical punishment of Hera in the Iliad: In A 566ff., when Hera intrudes on Zeus to discover what went on between him and Thetis concerning the (xfjviç of Achilles; in © 401ff., 415ff. (cf. lOff.), when at Hera's instigation Hera and Athene intended to intervene in the battle on behalf of the Achaeans; and in O 14ff. after Zeus' famous deception by his wife. In the cases mentioned above Hera has outwitted or acted against Zeus' will, with the consequence of drawing his wrath on herself. Let us see more closely what happens. In the first instance Hera succeeds in exposing, in front of the other gods, Zeus' inadequacy to conceal his activities from her, in spite of his confidence that he can do so (A 545ff.): Hera knew only too well what went on between him and Thetis and the promise that Achilles' mother had elicited from her husband. As soon as Zeus realized that Hera was challenging his authority his condescending and patronizing attitude towards her gave way to an explosion in his attempt to restore his prestige. In uncompromizing terms he asserts that he will do as he pleases and advises Hera to sit silent and obey him (A 564f.). In order to enforce his commands his ultimate 'persuasive' argument is to resort to threats of physical violence against her (A 566f.)': 1 I quote from the Oxford edition by D. B. Monro - T. W. Allen, 31920.</page><page sequence="2">14 Katerina Synodinou (iT| vu toi où xpavGncocnv öaoi Geoi eîa' èv 'OA.ü|xrc(p àacov îôv0', öte ksv toi âànxovç, xeïpaç ècpelco The prospect of his threats being carried out is confirmed by Hephaestus' recollection of past incidents when he tried to help his mother with the consequence of suffering himself Zeus' violence by being thrown out from the threshold of heaven (A 590f.). In the second case of Hera facing the prospect of maltreatment by her husband she ignores his strong warnings against the gods not to dare intervene in the battle either on behalf of the Trojans or the Danaans (© 5ff.). But despite Zeus' ugly threats coupled with his boasting of his supreme might, Hera does not acquiesce in her husband's command. Unlike the rest of the gods, who remained silent, with the exception of Athene who at last uttered some words of compromise (0 3Iff.), Hera ignores Zeus and displays a remarkable activity: she tries unsuccessfully to persuade Poseidon to intervene on behalf of the Achaeans (© 201 ff.), she prompts Agamemnon to encourage them (0 218), and finally she agitates Athene to engage battle with her against the Trojans (0 350ff.). Predictably, when Zeus saw them in the chariot starting for the battlefield he was enraged and sent Iris to stop them. Once again the father of gods resorts to intimidation in order to enforce his will, the only difference being that now his threats are more concrete and far more frightening than the previous ones (0 402—405): γυιώσω μέν σφωϊν ύφ' αρμασιν ώκέας ϊππους, αύτάς δ' έκ δίφρου βαλέω κατά θ' άρματα αξω· ούδέ κεν ές δεκάτους περιτελλομένους ένιαυτούς ελκε' άπαλθήσεσθον, α κεν μάρπτησι κεραυνός. The last instance of Zeus terrorizing Hera by means of physical violence occurs after her seduction of him. Soon after she had seen, to her pleasure, Poseidon fighting on the battlefield for the Achaeans and she had felt hatred for her husband who was sitting on Ida she conceived the plan to seduce him in order to make him fall asleep so that Poseidon would be undisturbed and more active in his intervention (E 147ff.). To achieve this purpose she employed not only the traditional female 'weapons', making herself beautiful, but she summoned all her contriving and conspiratory talents in order to recruit Aphrodite's and Sleep's help. Hera's plan worked perfectly. As soon as Zeus woke up and saw the Trojans driven to flight and Hector in the plain vomiting blood, his immediate response was to threaten her again (O 16—22):</page><page sequence="3">Physical Abuse of Hera by Zeus in the Iliad 15 ού μάν οίδ' ει αδτε κακορραφίης άλεγεινής πρώτη έπαύρηαι καί σε πληγησιν ίμάσσω. ή ού μέμνη δτε τ' έκρέμω ύψόθεν, έκ δέ ποδοΐιν ακμονας ήκα δύω, περί χερσί δέ δεσμό ν ϊηλα χρύσεον άρρηκτον; σύ δ' èv αιθέρι καί νεφέλησιν έκρέμω· ήλάστεον δέ θεοί κατά μακρόν Όλυμπον, λύσαι δ' ούκ έδύναντο παρασταδόν... This time Zeus, as we see, is not content only to intimidate Hera with beatings. He goes on to remind her of her punishment or rather torture on some other occasion (concerning Heracles) and the gods' inadequacy to rescue her. The recalling of her previous punishment renders realistic his present menaces; any moment they could be fulfilled. The circumstances of Zeus resorting to threats of physical violence suggest certain inferences. Zeus, on his part, certainly has some good reasons to behave towards Hera in this way. She is constantly challenging his authority, as he himself points out to Iris when he sends her to bring his message to Hera and Athene to abandon their plans to assist the Achaeans and to come back to Olympus (© 407f.). She disobeys his commands in order to realize her own policy and designs in regard to the war. In her effort she is intelligent, contriving, persistent, energetic and effective. In fact there seems to be an ascending scale in his threats corresponding to the effectiveness of Hera's schemes: from simple intimidation to lay his hands on her when she showed him up concerning his promise to Thetis, to specific, detailed threats when she started to engage battle with Athene against the Trojans, to the recalling of her real, previous torture by him, when her seduction of him had certain consequences, the flight of the Trojans and the wounding of Hector. Corresponding to the ascending scale of Zeus' terrorism is Hera's response to it; the more formidable menaces she is confronted with, the more submissive she becomes. In the face of Zeus' terrorism the overall characteristic of Hera is paralysing fear which makes her retreat immediately. In the first instance Hera was afraid and sat silent and depressed (A 568f.). The outburst of Zeus not only affected his wife, but troubled the rest of the gods as well (A 570). But this unpleasant state did not last for a long time — as soon as Hephaestus undertook to bring about a reconciliation, Hera accepted smiling a cup of nectar from the hands of her son (A 595f.). Precisely this was the first sign of release of the tension, immediately to be followed by the hearty laughter of the gods as they watched Hephaestus "bustling about the palace" (A 600). It is more, I think, the release of a tense situation that caused the exhilaration of the</page><page sequence="4">16 Katerina Synodinou gods rather than, as has been maintained, the comic spectacle that Hephaestus presented2. At best the lame god provided only the pretext for it. Confirmation of the transient, so to speak, character of the episode is the masterful stroke of the poet who presents Hera at the end of the banquet as going to sleep beside her husband, Zeus ! In the second case the impact of Zeus' intimidation upon Hera appears more drastic. As soon as she gets the message from Iris she retreats at once. And not only that. She renounces in strong terms her protégés and by implication her own efforts and fervent wish to assist them: she will not let herself and Athene fight against Zeus for mortals' sake, let one of them perish and another live, let him (Zeus) decide whatever he wants for Danaans and Trojans, as is fitting (© 427ff.). This striking attitude of Hera contradicts, to say the least, her former mighty efforts to find a way to help the Achaeans. Her initiative and her actions came to an end the moment that Zeus threatened her (and Athene) with violence. The prospect of physical abuse is the ultimate 'argument', it seems, by which every wish, plan or action of Hera is thwarted. No doubt, Zeus himself is quite aware of the effectiveness of its 'persuasive' force, since he does not hesitate to employ it when he is afraid things may get out of control. Indeed he feels so secure that he laughs at his wife and daughter after their unconditional surrender (0 447ff.) and declares openly that he does not take into account Hera's anger at all (0 477ff.). She has nothing to reply to it. Her frustration seems to be taken for granted. But the climax of Hera's submission and humiliation is brought about as a consequence of Zeus' seduction which made possible the temporary setback of the Trojans and Hector's injury. No later had Hera heard her husband shouting once again his threats against her and reminding her of her past torture than she was terrified and went to every length to assure Zeus of her 'innocence': instantly she took a solemn oath that it was not at her bidding that Poseidon assisted the Achaeans (O 4 Iff.). This of course is to some extent true. It was on his own initiative that he got involved in the battle. But what Hera concealed was that she conceived the stratagem of Zeus' deception in order to make it easier for Poseidon to fight for the Achaeans. And no doubt her fervent wish and efforts were directed to that goal, that is to the frustration of Zeus' promise to Thetis. 2 See, for example, W. Schadewaldt, Uiasstudien (Darmstadt 31966), 147; F. Codino, Eiaaycoyfi axàv "0|XT|po, transi. Pep. Bavôràpoç ('A0f)va 1981 [Torino 1965]), 201.</page><page sequence="5">Physical Abuse of Hera by Zeus in the Iliad 17 In order to lend weight to her words she readily invokes the holy name of Earth and Heaven and the water of Styx, Zeus' sacred head and their own marital couch, by which, she dares to say, she would never forswear herself (O 36ff.). The irony of this oath is beyond dispute for anyone who knows Hera's feelings and actions. Like any helpless person who does not hesitate to use any means in order to escape from a difficult situation, Hera not only takes an insincere oath, to say the least, but in addition she tries desperately to appease Zeus. Reversing her own designs she promises her husband to win over to him Poseidon (O 45f.). Confident of his hold over her Zeus does not recoil from sending her as his messenger to Iris and Apollo, whom he will employ in order to countermand the consequences of his seduction (O 53ff.). So she is reduced to no less than an instrument of Zeus; she becomes his servant. Hera then came full circle contributing actively to the fulfilment of Zeus' will, which means the frustration of her own policy. From what we have said it becomes evident that Hera has indeed royal interests and ambitions. She wants to participate in and to shape and direct the course of the war according to her wishes and plans. For that purpose she proves to be resourceful, persistent and active, even though in regard to Zeus' deception her 'weapons' were the traditional female ones of sexual attraction3. But any initiative, activity and strategy of Hera comes to an end as soon as she faces Zeus' threats of physical violence4. It is the limit against which she is measured and found wanting. In face of it she is rendered despondent. She can neither defend herself against it nor defy it. Even less is she ready to suffer its consequences. On the contrary, whenever she is confronted by Zeus, she rushes to abandon and to denounce her own plans and actions. The ultimate alienation is to place herself in Zeus' service in opposition to everything she stands for. In other words in her relationship to her husband Hera appears dependent, submissive, oppressed, frustrated and finally alienated, despite or rather because of her position as Zeus' royal consort, and despite her intellectual and other faculties which she displays when Zeus is not around. Such a paralysing fear of Zeus or rather of Zeus' violence is the pervasive characteristic of the divine couple's relationship. 3 See for example, Κ. J. Atchity, Homer's Iliad (Carbondale 1978), 102; H. Monsacré, Les larmes d'Achille (Paris 1984), 108; S. Said, Sophiste et tyran ou le problème du Prométhée enchaîné (Paris 1985), 235. 4 It has been recognized that one of the foundations of Zeus' power generally rests in his force. See, for example, M. P. Nilsson, The Mycenaean Origin of Greeîc Mythology (New York 1963,11932), 245; A. Severyns, Les Dieux d'Homère (Paris 1966), 4; Said, 238.</page><page sequence="6">18 Katerina Synodinou Once we realize this aspect of their encounters we are in a better position to account for them and furthermore to see under a somewhat different perspective the pertinent interpretations of several scholars. To begin with, in their overall treatment of gods in Homer some critics point out the comic element that permeates the rapport among the gods, which is in general attributed to their anthropomorphic presentation by Homer. Among the episodes referred to for their funny character are those of the quarrel of Zeus and Hera in the first Book and of Zeus' deception5. Within the same frame of gods' anthropomorphic treatment F. Codino considers Zeus' threats excessive, since they are not executed and therefore comic. Generally, in his opinion, because the conflicts between gods do not present any real danger (death — gods are immortal), they degenerate into caricature, they become pettybourgeois family quarrels6. On the other hand some scholars deny an overall comic character to the quarrel of Zeus and Hera and confine it to the last part of the episode which has to do with the intervention of Hephaestus7. Whether or not the conflicts of the divine couple are really amusing is difficult to tell. Evidently the answer is based on, or at the best is influenced by subjective factors, and it has to do with the response of the critics (the reader in general) to them, which in turn depends on their premises in approaching these conflicts. In other words, if one sees fun in the threats of Zeus against his wife and in their impact to her, there is no rational argument in the world to prove otherwise. The only thing beyond dispute, which, I hope, we have established so far, is that at least for Hera herself Zeus' terrorism against her is not funny at all. But, I hasten to add, this does not demonstrate anything for our argument. So the best thing 5 See, for example, C. M. Bowra, Tradition and Design in the Iliad (Oxford 1963, '1930), 222f.; Homer (London 1979, '1972), 111. An extreme view of the comic aspect of the gods in general is taken by J. M. Redfield, Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector (Chicago and London 1975), 76, according to which "the gods of the Iliad are lacking in numen\ they are in fact the chief source of comedy in the poem". A middle position is taken by J. Griffin, Homer on Life and Death (Oxford 1980), 172, 199f., and passim, who in his criticism of J. M. Redfield's view points out the ambivalent status of the gods between sublimity and frivolity and quotes with approval K. Reinhardts coined phrase "a sublime frivolity" for the gods of the Iliad. — See also C. H. Whitman, Hera's Anvils, Harv. St. 74 (1970), 42, who, without denying the "comic" character of the episode of Zeus' deception and of Hera's prospective punishment, suggests that Hera might have been an earth-goddess and that "in describing the method (of Hera's punishment) the poet seems to have used some motifs from a myth of the eternal confrontation of Earth and Sky". 6 Codino, 203, and passim. 7 Schadewaldt, 147; 'OXya Ko|xvr|vou-KaKpi6fi, EysSio Kai ts^vikti tt|ç IXiàôaç (A0t]va, 1970, '1947), 22.</page><page sequence="7">Physical Abuse of Hera by Zeus in the Iliad 19 seems to leave open the question to the discreet disposition of the reader, with the confession that as far as my response is concerned I fail to feel much comedy in the scenes under discussion. Nor is it necessary for Zeus to administer those threats in order to make them 'real', since Hera complies immediately and unconditionally to his will so that his conflict with her is satisfactorily and realistically resolved8. Somewhat related to the above interpretations are the ones advanced by F. Robert, who speaks of "domestic comedy" regarding the relation ship between Zeus and Hera9, and by M. P. Nilsson, who considers that the Ionian minstrels, irreligious as they were, modified the earlier myths, introducing into them a "burlesque" element, thus making, for example, the holy wedding of Zeus and Hera a "rather sensual love affair"10. However, as C. R. Beye rightly observes, what prevails in "Hera's seduction is the slave's winning of the master and Zeus' recital of his amorous conquests is pompous egoism"11. In addition, if we keep in mind Hera's emotional state (she felt hatred for her husband S 158) when she conceived the plan to seduce him and, more important, if we recall the evolution and resolution of the conflicts, we may wonder, along with C. R. Beye, with what sort of "domestic comedy" we have to do or with what sort of "sensual love affair". Elsewhere C. R. Beye gave his own explanation of the conflicts among the gods and more specifically of the ones under discussion. According to him these scenes seem to be a parody of earthly quarrels and by means of those scenes "Homer strives to caricature heroism ... not so much to mock heroic behaviour as to save it" by exposing man's limitations "when gods who are little different from man in these scenes act out his vulnerability"12. Nonetheless, to confine the discussion to the scenes we are interested in, this interpretation does not account for the catalytic impact on Hera of Zeus' terrorism. Parody of the human conflict which ends up with the out and out retreat or rather defeat of the one party involved, the female. Even if we accept that the poet wanted indeed to parody the human dissension of the heroes, still his assumptions in opting to present and solve the heavenly strife the way he does are indicative of some other realities which may have determined his choices. 8 Codino, 204, maintains that the poet introduces Hephaestus into the scene in order to give a "poetical" solution where there could not be a real one which would satisfy rationally the audience. 9 F. Robert, Homère (Paris 1950), 102. 10 Nilsson, 214. 11 C. R. Beye, Male and Female in the Homeric Poems, Ramus 3 (1974), 92. 12 C. R. Beye, The Iliad, the Odyssey and the Epic Tradition (London - Melbourne 1968), 124ff.</page><page sequence="8">20 Katerina Synodinou Furthermore, there are attempts to explain the hostility between the divine couple in terms of rival religious systems, one represented by Hera, the other by Zeus13. Another interpretation suggests that the couple's conflict in connection with Poseidon's plots reflects dynastic quarrels within kingly families on earth14. But, as C. R. Beye has rightly observed, such theories do not illuminate "why the conflict came to be represented by conjugal hostility rather than, say, intense sibling rivalry or some other human relationship"15. The same holds true for K. J. Atchity's view according to which Zeus represents a spirit of order in contrast to his wife's disorderly nature16. In addition, as I have already hinted to, they do not account for the specific means that Zeus employs in order to subdue Hera and for her submission to him, unless we assume that since Zeus 'historically' was the ultimate winner in the divine struggle for power, he is justified to be presented as the absolute master in regard to his conflicts with Hera in the Iliad. Be that as it may, the overall impression one gets from these scenes is not the struggle of two equivalent, so to speak, rivals and the eventual defeat of one of them, but the unconditional surrender of the wife in face of the mere threats of physical abuse by her husband. Such a reality, I am afraid, sets the whole affair in a more conventional and familiar frame, that is within the household of a couple (albeit the royal and divine one par excellence). In such a frame C. R. Beye has rightly, I think, placed the relationship between Zeus and Hera by pointing out that "Hera in fact, because she is a goddess may be the very paradigm wife". Objections however may arise when the same critic, referring to the hostile relationship between the divine couple, mantains that "Hera, for all that she is not number one, exercises obvious control in this situation. This too, is true to what seems to be a psychological fact, that is, that the dependent relationship is also a controlling one"17. Theoretically speaking things may be in general so: that a dependent relationship is also a controlling one. But looking closely at the evidence and more concretely at the impact Zeus' threats have on Hera one could wonder what sort of control under these circumstances Hera exercises. True, Zeus takes account of her, as is shown in his initial reservations about promising to Thetis, which spring from fear of Hera's 13 J. A. K. Thomson, Studies in the Odyssey (Oxford 1914, New York 1966), 153. 14 Nilsson, 248. 15 Beye, Male and Female, 92. 16 Atchity, 101, and passim. 17 Beye, Male and Female, 9If.</page><page sequence="9">Physical Abuse of Hera by Zeus in the Iliad 21 reaction (A 518ff.), and in his wish to win her over to him after his deception and her ostensible acquiescence to his will (O 49ff.). He recognizes she is one of the main obstacles in the realization of his decisions. Nonetheless, at the crucial moment he has the means, as we have seen, to subject her completely and to frustrate her designs and actions. Perhaps it is too trite to say the obvious thing that after all Hera, in spite of her high position in the divine pantheon, is in the scenes under discussion only the oppressed woman who, although not lacking in ambitions and in abilities to carry them out, she has each time to face the violence of her all-powerful husband and to submit to it18. Of course her fault is, we could add, that she has ambitions of her own, plans of her own and is not simply — and ideally — the obedient wife who takes pride in the power of her husband and supports him in his policy, whatever it is19. But it is precisely this reality of Hera's attitude which feeds the other reality of Zeus' attitude towards her as we saw it delineated above. From this point of view it does not make much difference wether we accept C. R. Beye's opinion that whereas "the earthly couples in the Iliad would display the more positive values of the conjugal experience ... the divine couple would show the less attractive, less desirable attributes of a typical marriage"20. Again, by analogy, the female member of the couple will be subjected and submitted to violence. Nor does it help to argue that Zeus threatens physical violence not only against Hera but virtually against everybody, to forestall or subdue opposition from the other gods. This fact is an additional confirmation that Zeus is indeed the absolute master in heaven, even if he has sometimes to face difficulties in imposing and maintaining his authoritarian rule21. From Hera's point of view such a position of her husband makes it even more difficult for her to deal with the situation. On the other hand, although Zeus throws his threats against all and sundry, there is no face to-face confrontation with the other gods (except with Athene in the case we have seen) and consequently there is nothing similar to the evolution and elaboration of the collisions with Hera. All in all, it is evident that 18 See also K. Kerényi, Zeus und Hera: Urbild des Vaters, des Gatten und der Frau (Leiden 1972), 45, who maintains that "Das menschliche Vorbild zu Homers Schilderung ist die einfachste patriarchale Familie, in der der Hausvater, wenn es ihm so beliebt, seine Frau züchtigt". 19 See also W. Burkert, Greek Religion, transi, by John Raffan (Oxford 1985 [Stuttgart 1977]), 132. 20 Beye, Male and Female, 92f. 21 The absolute power of Zeus in general is well established. See, for example, Nilsson, 245f., and passim; Severyns, 4; Said, 235ff., and passim.</page><page sequence="10">22 Katerina Synodinou, Physical Abuse of Hera by Zeus Zeus' treatment of his wife is not in contradiction with the general assumptions of his attitude, deriving from his position as the absolute monarch in heaven. With such a paramount aspect of the relationship between Zeus and Hera, that is the terrorism by physical abuse on the part of the husband and the compliant surrender of the wife, conforms W. Burkert's view according to which "in comparison with the high esteem of her cult Hera seems to suffer something of a loss of status in Homer ,.."22. No doubt, under this perspective, Hera's weakness and dependency in the Iliad becomes all the more striking. On the other hand this same reality makes it easier to assess some of the strong characterizations attributed to Hera, as, for instance, hostility, scheming, frustration, resentment, bitterness, vindictiveness23. It seems difficult to expect something different from someone who is repeatedly humiliated and who not only cannot fulfil her own plans but in addition is forced to renounce them and to act against them24. Obviously Hera has a long way to go before she would be able to stand up to Zeus' violence, thus coming to grips with the main obstacle to the realization of her wishes, which could mean no less than the becoming of her own person. 22 Burkert, 132. 23 W. Th. MacCary, Childlike Achilles: Ontogeny and Phylogeny in the Iliad (New York 1982), 187. See also Beye, The Iliad, the Odyssey and the Epic Tradition, 65. 24 See also Burkert, 133f., who, drawing on the Iliad and other sources as well, points out that the other side of the marital dissension between the divine couple is that Hera in general is "dangerous, malicious, and implacable in her rage".</page></plain_text>
