<plain_text><page sequence="1">128 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW the topography of the cemeteries, or of individual tombs. The absence of contour- lines or spot-heights on the area plan, Fig. 3, is symptomatic - F. could usefully have followed the style of S. Hadjisavvas' Alassa area-plans in RDAC 1986 and 1989. While it is understandable that there are no plans for some of the looted tombs (nine of the 15 were looted or partly disturbed), it is surprising there are no plans of the unpillaged Alassa T5 and its 48 finds or Kandou T 22 and its 145 objects. More attention should be given to stratigraphy, vertical and horizontal, in individual tombs to try to determine whether burials were made simultaneously or successively, and to isolate groups of material within individual tombs, groups which might help discriminate ceramic development within the CA period more subtly. By oversight, 23 of the 26 items found inside the White Painted IV amphora Kandou T22:97 remain unidentified- a golden opportunity for recognizing a neatly closed group is thereby missed. The account of the MC Alassa T1 is similarly incomplete, for none of the 75 finds (including the very remarkable stone stamp-seal pl. XIV. 1) is attributed to any of the three chambers of which, it seems, the tomb consisted. F. dates the whole of this complex to MC II; without knowing what was found with what, it is difficult to know what to make of this material, though, to be sure, nos. 14 and 21, at least, look earlier than MC II. Some minor points - Alassa Tl: 13 is a 'dipper' or 'scoop' rather than a 'ladle'. Can Alassa T1:39 really be called anthropomorphic? The 'lids' of Alassa T4 (la, 5a, 6a) are 'stoppers'. Alassa T5:17, 18 and 24 are not 'carinated' - F.'s use of the term is incorrect elsewhere, too. The bowl type Alassa T5:8, said to be common at Amathus, is similarly common in the Turabi Tekke tombs at Larnaka. Reference is made to the ' great number of sherds' found in the looted tombs Alassa 7 and 10, but no evaluation of this material is made. The sphinx on Alassa 7:1 and the agrimi on Alassa 18: 38 are ' striding', not ' galloping'. The bronze and iron fibula Alassa 13:1 should have been compared to the rather larger Kouklia, Skales T94: 4, and Karageorghis' detailed note on it RDAC (1987), 89 n. 38. Alassa T13:23 (plain 'crater') can have nothing to do with Late Bronze Age craters. Kandou T22:56 and 70 are ' stamnoi' rather than ' dinoi'. The ship said to be engraved on T22:83 (p. 60, fig. 12) needs more support for the identification to be credible. The scale on the photograph of the scarab T22:136 suggests it is 5.0 cms long - the catalogue entry gives 1.5 cms as its length (this piece ought to have been drawn). The stone tools Alassa T18:12 and Kandou T22:86 are more likely to have been left behind by the workmen who cut the tombs than to be grave-gifts. A Bibliography (especially of excavations, etc., in the area of the Kouris dam) and an Index would have been welcome. There are numerous misprints. Langford H. W.

Though such material is quite well represented in the archaeological record from prehistoric times onwards, it became exceptionally abundant in the numerous sanctuaries of the Archaic period, so many of which were prematurely investigated in the last century; virtually every museum and private collection the world over which contains Cypriot objects includes material which illustrates some aspect, at least, of this rich legacy. Hitherto no comprehensive account has been written. Now K. (recently appointed the first Professor of Archaeology in the new University of Cyprus, not long after retiring from his distinguished career as Director of Antiquities) intends, in a series of three volumes of which this is the first, to present a 'catalogue raisonne' of Cypriot coroplastic art. He warns us that, as with his La Ceramique Chypriote de Style Figure (1974), written with J. des Gagniers, there will be only limited commentary, and he intends to leave technical and scientific studies of the material to others in the future. The time is ripe; there have been several important studies on a number of the topics now covered by K., including papers by Annie Caubet and Lucia Vagnetti, the dissertations of D. Bolger (now a SIMA volume) and N. K. Mogelonsky, the monograph by P. Flourentzos, the extensive treatment by D. Morris in his Art of Ancient Cyprus, not to mention the Brussels-Liege-Amsterdam conference of 1989 (F. Vandenabeele and R. Laffineur, edd., Cypriote Terracottas [1991]). Moreover, the recent discoveries at the Chalcolithic site of Kissonerga, Mosphilia, by E. J. Peltenburg and his team (Antiquity 62 [1988], 289-93) have added a new dimension to the study of Chalcolithic modelling. K. himself is ideally qualified to undertake this commitment, with his unrivalled knowledge of the island's archaeology, an exceptionally broad grasp of Museum and private collections in and beyond Cyprus, experience of studying and publishing such material which began with a paper in RDAC 1940-8 (1958), and includes the important volume Vases et Figurines de l'Age du Bronze a Chypre (1976) in collaboration with J. des Gagniers, and the generously acknowledged help of experienced colleagues - Yannis Hadjisavvas, Maria Hadji- kosti, Carolyn Elliot-Xenophontos and Sylvia Tornkvist. The result is a volume of which K. and its publishers, the A. G. Leventis Foundation, may be proud; it will prove an indispensable working tool for Cypriot- and other - prehistorians. In a work of this kind, the reader may hope for comprehensive descriptions of the material set out in a typological evolution whose stages may be checked against the chronological evidence of dated contexts, that it should where possible be interpreted, and its relevance to broader archaeological questions be made clear. In order to have a manageable undertaking, K. concentrates on classification and description, and offers a generous degree of interpretation. He is less concerned with chronological questions and in this, and other respects is evidently writing for a readership already fairly well versed in Cypriot prehistory, for whom it will not be too challenging to date the context of, say, Vounous B, T.145 or Toumba tou Skourou T.1. This volume describes some 600 Chalcolithic, Early and Middle Cypriot (EC, MC) and Late Cypriot (LC) I items, covering roughly 2,000 years from the fourth millennium B.C. until c. 1550 B.C. With the exception of EC-LC I anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases, K. considers all modelling in baked clay, including human and animal figures in the round and in relief, free-standing or affixes, full figures, busts and protomes, groups, genre scenes, models and skeuomorphs. Virtually every piece is illustrated by photographs, and nearly a third (including most of the Chalcolithic material) also has drawings. The reproduction of most photographs is good - many are excellent, but a few, particularly of the ' Scenic Compositions' are not well lighted, and are difficult to understand (e.g. pl. LXV, LXVII, LXXIX). These are, of course,</page><page sequence="3">130 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW particularly difficult subjects. The careful description of each piece (sometimes adopting the exacavator's own account) includes details of provenance, present whereabouts and bibliography. Much of the Chalcolithic material comes from controlled settlement excavation, while the later material, where provenance is known, comes virtually exclusively from tombs. Over 90% of the former has a provenance, less than 50 % of the latter comes from a sure find-spot, and only 35 % from controlled contexts. Distribution is also uneven. 82 Chalcolithic pieces come from nine known find-spots, all in S, SW or W Cyprus; 60 % of them were found at Erimi. The 225 Bronze Age (BA) items from known find-spots come from more than 30 sites spread fairly evenly throughout the island, yet 70% are accounted for by Bellapais, Vounous, Lapithos and Nicosia, Ayia Paraskevi. In some cases, examples of a particular class of object (e.g. Class Bd, Class HB) all come from a single site (in these cases, Lapithos and Vounous, respectively). There are other, more telling differences between the Chalcolithic and the BA material. Discounting the ten Chalcolithic anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases (since these are excluded from the BA material), 94 % of the Chalcolithic modelling comprises human male or female figures in the round. From the BA material, only 36% comprises individual figures 'in the round', and many of these are the highly stylised 'plank-figures' and their kin. The remainder are human or animal vase affixes, elements in scenic compositions like the Vounous ploughing model, relief figures attached to Red Polished and Black Polished vases, models of furniture, weapons, instruments, and skeuomorphs like the (drinking?) horns. K. discusses functions of both major groups as thoroughly as this can be done (note, for example, his very full account of the Chalcolithic seated male figure in the Pierides collection, no. 1). But interpretation is inevitably subjective, and there will never be any certainties; we must hope for more finds like the Kissonerga group which will, at least, help to narrow the range of possibilities. K. has done a great service by giving prominence to the remarkable phenomenon of EC/MC modelling, without exaggerating its aesthetic qualities, or striving too hard after interpretation. The plank figures are an acquired taste, the individual figures in the scenic compositions are jejune, some of the Red Polished and Black Polished vases embellished with human or animal affixes or reliefs verge on the comic, yet, despite all this, it is the coroplasts of the period who have given it its unique quality, its charm and its immediacy. Though we shall never know what the participants in the Vounous 'sanctuary', or the figures on the rim of the Margi bowl are really doing, their very presence helps us to visualise the world they once peopled in a way that nothing else that has survived of theirs can do - they are doubly precious. Some minor points- K. might usefully have included a critical summary of the work of his predecessors, to offer a more definite point of departure for his own. Captions to the plates of Chalcolithic figures include their provenance; what a pity that this information is not given on the plates of BA material. Some plates lack note of scale, in whole or part (e.g. pls. I-III, V, VII). Though the title refers to LC I material, it is not clear what this comprises; here in particular K.'s economy with chronological matters is a disadvantage. p. 32, no. 61: is this really a head? p. 33, no. 65: the painted detail on the photograph, pl. XIV, is missing on the drawing. p. 37, no. 87: better omitted? p. 41: reference to lost wax casting inappropriate. p. 42: is there any proof that it was the workers in stone who were innovative? p. 44: it is risky attaching much weight to the unprovenanced figure believed EC I by Stewart. p. 49: the derivation of the plank- figures from much larger wooden prototypes is most attractive - could EC sculptors have cut out such figures with the tools available? p. 52: more discussion of the different classes' chronology would have been useful. p. 58 Ba 16 = pl. XXII: 3 stands apart from the rest of the</page><page sequence="4">131 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW items in this group. p. 69: fig. 75, if the two sides are compared, seems inaccurate. p. 90: as K. recognizes, Group Bb could easily be subsumed within Group Ba. p. 104: no. 16: difficult to interpret - can this really be a saddle, rather than the riders disliked by K. ? p. 106: the Stewarts thought the two apparently free-standing animals in Vounous T.1 60 had originally been affixes on T.160A: 13 (Vounous 1937-8, 208-9), and therefore contemporary with it. The suggestion that animal figures were 'toys' is unconvincing, and against the thrust of the rest of K.'s argument. p. 107, no. 6 = pl. LIX:5: this is not a 'table', but the base of a 'scenic composition' from which the figures have been broken. ibid, nos. 8-10: these are pottery spoons/ladles, rather than 'models' of such objects. p. 108, no. 14: this object is so unusual that a Cypriot origin must be in doubt. p. 141: K.'s robust identification of the sanctuary identification is surely correct. p. 142: the ploughing model may well be more religious than genre. p. 144: K. must be night to interpret the Kotchati and Kalopsidha models as sanctuaries. p. 175: ' sternum' must be a slip for 'clavicles'. p. 179: is no. 3 a conflation of a male and a female figure, rather than a '... two- headed(?) female'? There is an excellent Bibliography. The Museums'/Collections' Index (pp. 210-12) would have been even more useful (though, inevitably, longer) had it been arranged on a basis of inventory numbers. A List of Plates with page references, or some other device for easier reference between Plates and text, would have been welcome. Langford H. W. CATLING ANCIENT GREEK TOPOGRAPHY W.

Pp. x+228; 10 figures in text, 173 plates (on 89pp.). Amsterdam: J. C. Gieben, 1991. Paper, fl. 160/DM 145. Few, if any, recent scholars have made as great a contribution to the study of Greek topography as W. K. Pritchett. He deserves no small part of the credit for the increasing frequency of publications in this field, a development with which the later volumes of 'SAGT' (hereinafter cited by volume and chapter number) have coincided. To give just two examples of this upswing: there is now a multi-language periodical from Athens, Horos, specifically devoted to epigraphy and topography, while not long ago a conference lasting several days was held in Athens on 'Land routes in Greece from prehistoric to post-Byzantine times'. Earlier numbers of SAGT, appearing roughly in tandem with P.'s volumes entitled The Greek State at War, established the military-historical framework for the series. Volumes i-ii (1965; 1969) were largely devoted to battlefields. After an interval came volume iii (1980), which includes two classic studies, 'Ancient Greek roads' and 'Greek section of Peutinger Table'. From a glance at the contents of volumes iv-v (1982; 1985) and the two new volumes, a number of recurrent themes and favoured geographical areas emerge. Of areas returned to by P. for volumes vi-vii, perhaps the most prominent is northern and eastern Lakonia together with the Thyreatis; new focuses of his interest include Aitolia and Akarnania, and Philip V's campaign ?
