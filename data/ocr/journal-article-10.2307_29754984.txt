<plain_text><page sequence="1">Preliminary Report on the Pre-Buddhist Necropolises in Swat (W. Pakistan) During widespread exploration and research extending over several years throughout the Swat region (W. Pakistan), Professor Giuseppe Tucci, as early as 1958, detected the presence of various necropolises. Owing to a number of features and data they contained it was possible to assign them to a pre-Buddhist age (*). It was indeed a significant dis? covery, for it enabled us to throw light upon hitherto wholly unknown aspects of the protohistory of the N.W.F. region (2). The next step was excavation carried out by the Italian Archaelogical Mission (IsMEO) and developed during a series of campaigns mainly concentrated in three large cemeteries. A first dig was undertaken during the 1961 campaign by Dr. Maurizio Taddei and brought to light a complex of 48 tombs on the slopes of Mount Shar?r? in the valley of the Jambil torrent only a short distance from the centre of Mingora (Butkara II locality). It showed the stratigraphical relationship of the cemetery with remains of a later Buddhist age (3). In the next (1962) campaign excavation was resumed by Dr. Chiara Silvi Antonini at Loebanr I also in the Jambil valley (tombs 1-67), and at Katelai I in the adjacent Saidu valley (tombs 1-45) (4). Investigation of the necropolises went ahead thereafter. In the 1963 season Dr. Editta Castaldi, under the direction of Prof. S. M. Puglisi, further explored Katelai I (tombs 46 80) and in the two following years the present writer was extending excavation at Ka? telai I (tombs 81-237) and Loebanr I (tombs 68-183). The final report on the excavation of the Swat necropolises is at present being com? pleted (5). In this initial survey we shall mainly examine the investigations that I carried out myself during the campaigns of 1964-65. Study of the morphology of tombs and (*) G. Tucci, ?

Regarding typology of grave goods, for comparison and statistical analysis, we have taken into account material coming from the ex? cavations of 1961 and 1962. All material is housed in the headquarters of the Italian Ar? chaeological Mission except for a small part of it on view in the Swat Museum at Saidu Sharif (Swat). Fig. 1 - Loebanr I. Squares excavated during the seasons 1962 (NMM, NMH, NMC, NMN, NMI, NMD, NMO, NMJ, NME, NNK, NNL), 1964 and 1965 (NHX, NHY, NHS, NHZ, NHT, NHO, NNA, NNB, NIU, NIP) 38</page><page sequence="3">LOEBANR I Loebanr I is situated on the slopes of Mount Loe Sar, and here excavation in the 1964 and 1965 campaigns was extended to an area adjacent to the one explored in 1962 (6) (figs. 1, 2, 3, 9). Below a surface layer (stratum ?) the stratigraphy of the site is made up of a layer of grey-black earth (stratum ?) and then of yellow-brown earth of an essentially clayey cha? racter (stratum ?). Stratum ?, which appears in adjacent squares (excavations 1962), is not preserved here. The tomb-cavities show up on the surface of this latter stratum; they can be discerned because of the different colour and compactness of the soil used as a filling. The cavities are rectangular-shaped and generally have a uniform N.-S. orientation; usually, it is the upper cavity which sets the pattern and at the base of this some schist slabs serve as a covering for the narrower opening of the lower cavity. The depth of the upper cavities varies considerably. In view of the state of preserva? tion of the terrain it is not easy to decide whether such variety is due to the original outline of the tombs and state of the terrain, or is to be attributed to the subsequent action of floods. Be that as it may, flooding undoubtedly wrought destruction of which there is abundant evidence: tombs, for example, have been discovered with only the lower cavity remaining and then partly destroyed or missing right down to the base, and isolated slabs used as a covering have been found in a lower part of the cemetery towards the valley. Cavities are cut deeply out of the clayey and compact terrain of which their sides are form? ed: they are bare with no lining of any sort. In the lower cavities sometimes small dry walls were built on two or more sides and consist of stone slabs of uneven shape. In some cases they are diversified by niches housing some of the vases forming the grave furniture. Even if a stratigraphical differentiation is not apparent in these tombs owing to re? moval of the upper level of the cemetery, there are data, however, attesting to a long cycle of life in the necropolis ? in the first place the superimposed tombs. There are several examples of this overlapping at Loebanr I both partial and complete: for instance, tombs no. 69 and no. 116 that were largely formed out of the cavities of tombs no. 99 and no. 117. A small wall enclosing the lower cavity of tomb no. 92 rests on slabs of the covering of tomb no. 137. Then again, tombs no. 87 and 94 are situated side by side in the upper cavity of tomb no. 142 directly above the covering slabs of its lower cavity. As to funerary practices, there are in this area tombs situated one beside the other con? taining semi-charred bones deposited in a jar (26 of them), and inhumation tombs con? taining one or two skeletons (84 of them). The buried persons are always in a crouching position on one side, the head pointing towards the mountain. In single tombs a crouching and leaning on the right side (of which (6) In the 1964 and 1965 campaigns excavation was extended to the following squares (lOX 10 m.): NHZ, NHT, NHO, NHY, NHS, NIP, NIU, NNA, NNB, NHX. 39</page><page sequence="4">there are 30 examples) is much more common than a leaning on the left side (of which there are 4 examples). The finding of tombs in which bones are scattered or collected in disorderly heaps is fairly frequent; there, more than once, we discovered a skeleton still in place near to a second one relegated to a heap in a corner or at the side of the cavity. A wholly exceptional phenomenon was the finding of a skeleton without its skull which had been buried in a small hole at the bottom of the lower cavity (tomb no. 135). Four tombs, furnished with vases, have revealed no trace of bones. KATELAI I During the 1964 and 1965 campaigns digging at Katelai once again covered an area (500 sq. m.) very close to the zones of earlier excavation (7) (figs. 4, 5, 6, 10). Some features of this site are similar to those at Leobanr: the terrain slopes slightly, and the state of tomb preservation increases as we proceed towards the valley bottom. Con? versely, however, tombs are here much more strongly concentrated and the overlaying of tombs is more common ? there are sometimes several one above the other. The stratigraphy is as follows: a surface layer of blackish earth (stratum ?) followed by a layer of grey earth (stratum ?), and thirdly earth which is brown and clayey and con? tains traces of the cemetery (stratum ?). Cavities have a fairly uniform orientation (N.W. - S.E.). Their structure is identical to that of the Loebanr I tombs, but there is one fairly common variation: a thin slab of schist on which the interred person was usually laid (Fig. 4). The size of tombs, however, is somewhat smaller than those of the previous cemetery, even allowing for the frequent recurrence in some sectors of tombs for adolescents (8). As burials were frequent, most of the tombs have only a part of the upper cavity pre? served intact; there are many examples of covering slabs being partially removed owing to subsequent digging of other tombs (figs. 13, 29); and another fairly common occurrence is the finding of truncated skeletons when further cavities have intersected tombs at this level. Among the superimposed tombs that have been detected, the most significant are those falling into two groups. In the first of these tomb no. 120 has been dug out above tombs no. 131 and 132 which in their turn overlie tomb no. 150. When the latter was dug, part of the lower cavity of tomb no. 138 was destroyed. It was, therefore, earlier than all the others (*). In the second group, belonging to another part of the cemetery, the same phenomenon (7) In the 1964 and 1965 campaigns excavation was extended to the following squares (10 X10 m.): PMZ, PMT, PMH, PMI, PHV.

Here the lower cavity has a masonry lining and one of its sides is built on slabs that cover tombs no. 184 and 186 (figs. 15-17). Tomb no. 184 had in its turn cut into part of the lower cavity and the skeleton of tomb no. 179 below which lies tomb no. 204 (10). As far as funerary rites are concerned, the latest excavations at Katelai I repeat by and large the experience already acquired at Loebanr: that is to say, inhumation is far more common than cremation (98 instances as against 29). In the case of single burials bodies are usually leaning on the right side rather than the left (the ration is 31 to 15). The skull is always pointing towards the mountain. As for double burials, these nearly always consist of an undisturbed skeleton accompanied by a second skeleton broken up and heaped in a corner or at the side. There is one instance of triple burial (tomb no. 101). Tombs no. 119, 142 and 211 contained a skeleton in place and undisturbed and be? side it the remains of a half-burnt skeleton gathered into a heap. A similar combination of inhumation and cremation is evident in tomb no. 173 where the ashes were contained in a box-like urn. Sixteen tombs with vases as grave furniture revealed no trace of human bones. MORPHOLOGY OF THE TOMBS As has been evidenced by previous excavations, the graves of Loebanr I and Katelai I show a structure which is basically the same: they consist of an upper cavity rectangular in shape, preserved to different depths, at the bottom of which there was a smaller pit co? vered by schist slabs. The upper cavity is invariably filled with earth abundantly mixed with pebbles and schist fragments; also the lower one is now almost always wholly filled with earth which is uniform in composition and colour as if sifted. However, it must be remarked that, ori? ginally, the lower cavity was occupied by the dead person only. The earth that is found inside it, today, only penetrated there at a later stage through slow infiltration: a number of cracks between the slabs, and the existence of some tombs only partly filled with earth where infiltration is still going on, are evidence of this. As was pointed out, both upper and lower cavities have walls cut out from the bare earth. In the lower ones, sometimes, we find a dry wall-lining made of unevenly shaped stone slabs which covers the two main sides and occasionally all four. The dimensions of these tombs are on the whole fairly constant. What varies above all is the depth of the upper cavity. In fact, some tombs have been discovered where the upper cavity is preserved down to a considerable depth which in one instance was as (10) Depth of the tombs below surface level (bottom of lower cavity): no. 179 - 1.85 m.; no. 178 - 1.80 m.; no. 204 - 1.95 m.; no. 186 - 2.30 m.; no. 184 - 2.50 m. 47</page><page sequence="12">much as 4.30 m. The dimensions of the lower cavities, however, vary less: what dif? ferences exist concern their length, and this depends upon the type of burial. Cavities had to contain a corpse in cases of inhumation and a jar in cases of semi-combustion. Some cremation tombs have a lower cavity which is almost square in plan. The orientation of cavities is generally uniform within the confines of each cemetery (N.-S. at Loebanr; N.W.-S.E. at Katelai) and is connected with the topography of the va? rious sites. For instance, we see that tombs situated on the slopes of hills run longways from hill to valley and are thus clearly seen to fit the shape of the terrain. This disposition shows slight variations only in those tombs that were inserted between earlier ones; that is, when orientation was determined by the space available. The degree of tomb concentration in the two cemeteries is strikingly different. At Loebanr the space between one tomb and another is big enough to ensure that each burial would be complete and undisturbed; at Katelai, tombs are much more thickly concentrated and in one section of excavation 42 tombs exist in an area of no more than 100 sq. me? tres (12). In such conditions, superimposition in various tombs is hardly surprising. Study of these has shown also that their depth compared with the present surface cannot afford a criterion for chronological differentiation. This is proved by numerous instances of tombs being cut into the cavity of another and reaching a greater depth than the latter which is yet clearly the older. FUNERARY RITES In the necropolises of Loebanr I and Katelai I two different forms of funerary rite are evident. There are inhumation tombs with one or two skeletons flanked by cremation tombs where the ashes are mainly contained in large jars. Only in a few sectors of the excavated area involving a limited number of burials, did we find a group of tombs marked by the same ritual. In both cemeteries inhumation tombs far outnumbered cremation tombs. The dead person was always laid with his head pointing towards the mountain; the position was nearly always a crouching one resting on one side very often with a forced con? traction of the lower limbs. When skeletons were anatomically displaced their bones were piled to one side. The few instances of bones scattered higgledy-piggledy in the cavity have revealed clear evidence of tomb violation. In excavating multiple-burial tombs, various elements have emerged to confirm that the site was used in successive stages. This is particularly clear when an undisturbed skeleton is found with another whose bones have been displaced and heaped in a corner. The bones position of the latter often proves that the skeleton was shifted to make room for another. In some cases, however, we cannot dismiss the idea that we may be faced with evidence Katelai, tomb no. 135. The bottom of the lower cavity was situated 6.17 m. below the pre sent surface level. (12) Katelai, square PMH. 48</page><page sequence="13">of secondary burial. Some skeletons, that is to say, ? those whose bones have been dis? turbed ? may have been buried here after being conserved for a long time elsewhere: the existence of tombs (by no means infrequent) containing a single disconnected skeleton could well confirm this hypothesis. This custom may be related to a particular form of ritual of which protohistoric culture affords a variety of instances: the burial of a corpse in two stages (13). A common feature in cremation tombs is the presence of a plentiful residue of charcoal in the earth filling the upper cavity; it has often been found on the covering slabs. In the rite of semi-combustion the bones thus reduced were placed in a container with lid, or more rarely heaped at the bottom of the tomb. Another phenomenon which is not unusual especially at Katelai I, is the discovery of tombs without remains of human bones and containing just a few vases. TYPOLOGY OF GRAVE FURNITURE Grave furniture is largely made up of terracotta vases and objects in copper, bone and stone. Small objects in gold and silver are also found in isolation here and there. Some of the vases are sometimes found in the upper cavity of tombs and generally placed on the slabs serving as a covering. But in the vast majority of cases, these offerings are placed near the skeleton or around the jar holding the ashes. It is difficult to decide if the arrangement of grave goods was governed by precise rules: for vases, which predominate, are scattered all around the cavity, and the infiltration of water, above all, has shifted their position often to a marked extent and they are even to be found at different depths. Nevertheless, it remains a significant fact that the cinerary jars are nearly always si? tuated near the wall on the side towards the mountain; no jar containing human remains has ever been found beside or near the wall on the valley side. The position of some objects is relatively stable. Above the skull or near it (fig. 25) large pins are often found which leads us to conclude that in these circumstances they were used to keep the hair, or clothing around the head in place. Iron weapons usually lie on the dead person's chest or at his side. Anthropomorphic figurines occupied a special posi? tion being placed under the arm-pits or head, or at any rate near the body (fig. 24). The number of offerings making up the grave furniture varies markedly in all the ceme? teries. Some tombs are either devoid of objects or furnished only with one or two small vases; yet beside them are others of similar shape and size containing several dozens of objects. Tomb no. 97 at Loebanr ? one of the richest unearthed so far ? has yielded up 31 vases together with other minor objects. As will be seen from the general list included below, vases and other objects have a (13) E. O. James, Prehistoric Religion, London, 1957; Ital. ed., Milano, 1961, p. 47, pp. 113-115. 49</page><page sequence="14">very varying typology. Our aim in compiling such a list was to distinguish finds according to the nature of their material (ceramic, metal, glass, bone and stone). Then within these various categories we have distinguished diverse classes of objects and the types composing each class. The sign for each type is a capital letter (C, M, G, B, S standing respectively for Ceramics, Metal, Glass, Bone, and Stone) followed by a small letter indicating the class of objects, and then a Roman numeral that distinguishes the types in each class. In noting the recurrence of various types in the tombs, we have also made clear in brackets whether their provenance is Loebanr I, Katelai I, or Butkara II.

THE ASSOCIATIONS OF FINDS The above description of the grave goods affords a good idea of their typology and their distribution among the three necropolises. Investigating further and supplementing our typological picture by a chronological one, we must study the associations between in? dividual types. By extending our analysis to nearly three thousand artifacts from 435 tombs we have plenty of important elements for comparison and judgment. A general and summary idea, but one clearly reflecting the overall picture of the asso? ciations between various types under examination, may be gleaned by the table contained in fig. 8: here the associations between some of the most representative and recurrent types are indicated (15). It becomes fairly clear that the way various types are associated does not depend on mere chance or a fortuitous choice: instead, it reveals an intention to choose well-defined groups of types rather than others. We have been able to perceive that specific associations regarding certain types of vases and objects exist, and different associations are connected with a second or even third group of types. In studying these associative tendencies and distinguishing those groups that are auto? nomous, metal objects indubitably serve to establish a criterion of differentiation. They have been discovered in 152 tombs altogether: 119 of these contained only copper objects, 18 copper and iron objects, and 15 iron objects alone. A glance at the associations bound up with the two most common objects in cop? per and iron (types Ma/II and Mb/I) proves that they were very different. Further con? firmation of this differentiation is obtained by setting on one side all types associated with tombs furnished with copper objects alone, and on the other those types removed from tombs where iron (whether singly or with copper) is a constituent of objects. The result is significant. Out of 78 types of vase previously described, those associated with iron are only 26, and mainly consist of red ware vases with thin sides. (15) The 14 types of fig. 8 include the two most common types in the classes of ceramics a, b, c, d, e; the 3 most common of the large vases; the most common type in metal (both copper and iron); and the urn. 60</page><page sequence="25">TYPES Cg/I Ca/I Ca/II Cc/I Cc/IV Cf/Ia Ma/II Cf/II Cb/I Cb/II Cf/III Cd/I Cd/VIII Mb/I XXXX xxxx xxxx XXXXi 'xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxx: xxxxi xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 30 17 6 5 M 30 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 11 XXXX XXXX XXXx 17 11 1 XXXX XXXX XXXX iXXXX 18 36 35 1 18 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 49 48 36 49 xxxxl xxxx xxxx |XXX&gt; 70 35 48 70 XXXX XXXX xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 16 17 19 16 XXXX, xxxx xxxx xxxx| 15 15 17 15 XXXX xxxx, xxxx xxxx1 16 19 15 16 ixxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx Fig. 8 - Associations of types (pottery and other objects) from Swat graveyards 61</page><page sequence="26">Another very interesting fact is that the difference between vases associated only with copper and those found in the presence of iron is not merely a formal one dependent on shape; it is a truly technical difference also connected with the materials used and the pro? duction process. The first group contains red and grey vases with thick sides made by hand or turned on the slow wheel which are mixed with grey ware of fine paste revealing a sound knowledge of production methods and baking. In the second there are a majority of red vases with thin sides supplemented by a few grey vases with the same characteristics reproducing the same forms as the red ones. The distinctive features of this production are accurate work of wheel-turning, the compactness of the material, and the constant re? currence of carination and corrugation of probable metallic origin. Regarding other components of grave furniture, a significant comparison can be made between the character of objects made of different metals. In tombs where only the pre? sence of copper was found, the principal objects made of this metal are large pins, ear-rings, needles and small knife-blades or small spatulas. In those where iron is also present, grave goods often comprise a fairly striking number of metal objects ? first and foremost, wea? pons (spear-heads, axes and arrow-heads). It should be pointed out, however, that the distinctions so far outlined have made up what is still an incomplete picture of the typological groups characterising the varied fur? niture of tombs. The numerous types associated with copper can, in their turn, be subdivided into three different groups marked by varying degrees of homogeneity and autonomy. Two groups are both characterised by red and grey, thick-sided ware, their main distinguishing components being box-shaped urns and cinerary jars decorated with anthropomorphic motifs respectively. A third group is made up of grey, incised, thin-sided ware; apart from technical differences of production, it has, compared with the other two, a greater variety of form and structure. By contrast, types associated with iron show no internal differentiation; on the whole, they make up a unified and homogeneous group. As for the associations between types belonging to different groups, it should be point? ed out that the two groups of coarse paste ware, both connected with the copper industry, have no associative relation with the types connected with the iron industry. It is the red ware with thin sides that is mainly connected with the latter (16). Likewise, there are hardly any associative relations between types of the group in which urns predominate and the types characterised by grey incised ware. Confirming the autonomy of the four typological groups into which the grave furni (16) The only exception to the consistency of these associations occurred in tomb no. 158 at Katelai where finds in iron and necklace compo? nents elsewhere associated with this metal were found together with two grey vases and a jar nor? mally present in tombs furnished with coarse pot? tery and metallic objects made of copper alone. The case is an interesting one since the tomb is of the double-burial sort, one of the skeletons being heaped in a corner to make room for the second body. A likely hypothesis is that this unusual as? sociation is connected with the different periods in which the tomb was used. It would seem to be confirmed by the respective position of vases and objects in relation to the two dead persons. 62</page><page sequence="27">ture falls, the data concerning the associations between all types previously listed serves to place these in a chronological sequence. Clearly, the groups linked to the copper industry (marked below by the letter A) are earlier than those linked to the iron industry (B), and in terms of their respective associative connexions, the following chronological sequence emerges: 1) Group A/1. Characterised by red and grey ware wtih thick sides and by the box-urns. Metallurgical industry comprises rare finds in copper. Distinctive types: Ca/I, Cc/I, Cc/II, Cc/VI, Cc/IX, Cf/II-a, Gg/I. Found at Katelai. 2) Group A/II. Characterised by red and grey ware with thick sides and cinerary jars decorated with anthropomorphic motifs. Copper industry. Distinctive types: Ca/III, Cc/I, Cc/II, Cc/III, Cc/IV, Cc/V, Cc/VII, Cc/VIII, Cf/I, Cf/I-a, Ch/I, Ma/III. Found at Loebanr, Katelai and in isolation at Butkara. 3) Group A/III. Characterised by grey incised ware with thin sides. Copper industry. Distinctive types: Cb/I, Cb/II, Cb/IV, Cb/V, Cb/VI, Cb/VII, Cb/IX, Cb/XIII, Cb/XIV, Cb/XV, Cb/XVIII, Cf/I, Cf/II, Ma/II, Ma/V. Found at Loebanr, Katelai and Butkara. 4) Group B. Characterised by red and grey ware with thin sides. Copper and iron industry. Distinctive types: Cb/VIII, Cd/I, Cd/II, Cd/III, Cd/IV, Cd/V, Cd/VI, Cd/VII, Cd/VIII, Cd/IX, Cd/X, Cd/XI, Cd/XII, Cd/XIII, Cf/III, Ch/II, Mb/I, Mb/II, Mb/III, Mb/IV, Mb/V, S/II. Found at Loebanr, Katelai and Butkara. CORRELATIONS AND RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY The salient features of these necropolises thrown into relief by our analysis, may briefly be summarised as follows: 1. The tombs are always sunk into the same type of clayey terrain. As the level of the necropolises has been lost, data for a chronological differentiation or a relative chronology are forthcoming when two or more tombs are related because they intersect or overlie each other. 2. Tombs are made up of two cavities: an upper one always filled with earth and also with stones; and a lower one covered by schist slabs which was occupied by the dead person. In some cases the lower cavity is seen to have a dry wall lining containing a few niches. 3. Funeral rites consist of semi-combustion and inhumation. Half-burnt bones were collected in a jar (only rarely are remains piled at the bottom of the tomb); and in inhuma? tion the dead persons were always placed in a crouching position leaning either on their right or left side, their head pointing towards the mountain. In double burial tombs a com? mon phenomenon is the presence of an undisturbed skeleton together with a second that has been displaced and left in a heap. 63</page><page sequence="28">4. Finds reveal the existence of two main metallurgical industries: copper and iron. Pottery of different types is also appaient: grey, red and brown ware of coarse paste, and grey and red ware of fine paste. On a modest scale there is evidence of an industry for the working of bone and semi-precious stones. 5. The distribution of the various types of vases and objects forming the grave fur? niture is not uniform in all the cemeteries. Katelai Fs typological variety is greater than that of Loebanr I and the latter's greater than at Butkara II where fine paste ware abounds but there is a dearth of ware with thick sides. 6. The distribution of the various types of vases and other objects is also very varied in the tombs of the same cemetery. There is, first of all, a differentiation of grave furni? ture in relation to the metallurgical industry which may be represented only by copper objects, by iron and copper objects combined, or by iron objects alone. Bearing in mind these cor? relations, we may identify four different typological groupings that are successive in time. We have, then, called attention to a number of features ? the stratigraphy and struc? ture of the tombs, the rites, typology and distribution of the grave furniture ? and it now behoves us to correlate these various factors so as to present a clear overall picture. Accordingly, a first connexion may be established between the stratigraphy of the tombs and their furniture. Many tombs, in fact, have been discovered that intersect or overlie one another, and the earlier can thus be separated from the later. We have also noted that grave goods may be divided up into four basic typological groups: A/I, A/II, A/M, and B. Let us now examine these groupings in relation to the superimposition of tombs so far indicat? ed. The picture that emerges is the following: Loebanr: Tomb no. 116 (B) above tomb no. 117 (A/M); tomb no. 92 (B) above tomb no. 137 (A/II); tombs no. 87 (A/M) and no. 94 (A/M) above tomb no. 142 (A/II). Katelai: Tomb no. 110 (B) above tomb no. 114 (A/M); tomb no. 118 (A/II) above tomb no. 117 (A/I); tomb no. 119 (A/II) above tomb no. 113 (A/I); tomb no. 120 (B) above tombs no. 131 (A/M), no. 132 (without furniture), no. 150 (A/I) and no, 138 (A/I); tomb no. 131 (A/M) above tomb no. 150 (A/I); tomb no. 133 (A/II) above tomb no. 154 (A/I); tomb no. 123 (A/II) above tombs no. 139 (without furniture) and no. 130 (A/I); tomb no. 178 (B) above tombs no. 184 (A/M), no. 186 (A/I) and no. 205 (A/I); tomb no. 176 (B) above tomb no. 180 (A/M); tomb no. 185 (B) above tomb no. 197 (A/I); tomb no. 189 (B) above tombs no. 190 (A/II) and no. 213 (A/II); tomb no. 231 (A/II) above tomb no. 232 (A/I). The data listed above are particularly significant since they show that tombs furnished with group B types overlie tombs furnished with every other group: tombs with A/M furniture similarly overlie those furnished with A/II and A/I; and lastly, tombs with A/II overlie those with A/I goods. On the strength, then, of the foregoing data, it can be esta? blished that groups A/I, A/II, A/M and B are successive chronologically. A second relationship is that between the structure of the tombs and their furniture. 64</page><page sequence="29">Fig. 9 - Loebanr I.

These tombs are furnished with typologically different goods and do not, therefore, belong to an identical period. It is to be noted, however, that those furnished with types of group A/I (18) and A/II (le) are characterised by a masonry of very unevenly cut slabs and do not form a continuously straight line. The use of material in tombs fur? nished with types of group B (20) is different, for slabs are of uniform size and evenly cut on the whole so as to endow cavities with symmetry and also the niches in the walls. Some quite singular structures in tombs furnished with types of groups A/I and A/II deserve to be mentioned. We are thinking of two Loebanr rombs (21) whose lower cavity is divided crosswise by a wall of stones (fig. 12), and of three Katelai tombs (22) where the covering slabs are pierced by a large round hole (fig. 11). We come now to a third type of relationship ? that between the grave furniture and funerary rites. In tombs furnished with types belonging to groups A/I and A/II cremation clearly prevails over inhumation (there are 24 cases of the first and 14 of the second); yet this si? tuation is reversed in tombs associated with group A/M (94 cases of inhumation and 14 of cremation) and accentuated still further in tombs with group B types (20 inhumation burials and only one cremation). Regarding inhumation, it can be stated that in tombs furnished with types of groups A/I and A/II, only single burials were practised, whether the skeleton is still connected or disturbed. Multiple burials are always related to typological groups A/M and B, the ration between single and multiple burial being almost equal. It can also be remarked that the contracted or forced crouching position of the dead person common in such burials is not evident in tombs furnished with group B types: here the bones of lower limbs indicate a quite normal bending. Turning to cremation, we have seen that this rite entails the presence of large cine? rary jars (the scattering of burnt bones over the bottom of the tomb is rather rare and con? fined to the necropolis of Katelai). In this connexion it is worth noting that the large urn with straight, pierced sides (type Cg/I), conceived of, perhaps, as an imitation of houses is only to be found in tombs furnished with group A/1 types. The concept, however, would seem to persist in tombs furnished with artifacts of group A/II, where the cinerary jars are generally characterised by three holes (a large oval-rectangular one and two smaller, round ones at the sides) which are at times surmounted by an anthropomorphic image in relief (type Cf/I-a). The significance of this will be the object of comment in the final re? port on excavation, since the matter requires deeper research. As an initial working hy (17) Tombs with lower cavity lined with ma? sonry walls: no. 80, no. 85, no. 116, no. 172, no. 183 at Loebanr; no. 105, no. 136, no. 179, no. 187, no. 196 at Katelai.

(22) Katelai, tombs no 83, no. 133, and no. 154. 65</page><page sequence="45">pothesis we suggest that the purpose of these holes in the sides of cinerary vases was to provide a passage for the soul. In this connexion it is germane to recall the discovery at Leobanr of two tombs the lower cavities of which were divided crosswise by a small stone wall containing a tiny rectangular doorway at its base (fig. 12). Similarly, at Katelai, we found three tombs with large round holes in their covering slabs (fig. 11), just above the skull of the dead person or the cinerary jar. In both cemeteries these tombs were furnished with types belonging to groups A/I and A/II. A final comment concerns those tombs where no burial took place, for they are charac? terised only by vases and other objects. These ? there are 17 of them ?are akin to the tombs already referred to: they are always furnished with A/1 and A/II types. The data collected during work of analysis and comparison enable us to piece together a picture of the various features of the necropolises and their chronological development. The following chronological sequence is based on the main distinguishing features: Period I. a) Cremation prevailed over inhumation; use of box-urns; single burial with skeleton left whole or disturbed; contracted crouching position; vase furniture with no trace of burial. b) Copper industry; pottery made up of red and grey ware with thick sides either hand-made or wheel-turned in rudimentary fashion. c) Furniture consisting of typological groups A/I and A/II (23). Period II. a) Inhumation prevailed over cremation; multiple burial with skeleton either left whole or dismembered; contracted crouching position prevailed. b) Copper industry; pottery consisting of wheel-turned grey incised vases of fine paste. c) Furniture made up of typological group A/III. Period III. a) Almost absolute prevalence of inhumation burial over cremation; single and multiple burial with skeleton left whole or dismembered; normal crouching position. b) Copper and iron industry; pottery mainly consisting of wheel-turned red vases of fine paste. c) Furniture made up of typological group B. (23) In view of the fact that both the form of funerary rite and the implements are similar in tombs furnished with typological groups A/1 and A/II, and that these same groups have in common the type recurring most in both (type Cc/I), we felt obliged to consider them equally distinctive of Period I. 66</page><page sequence="46">TYPOLOGICAL COMPARISONS Possible correlations and comparisons between the culture of the Swat necropolises and other proto-historic cultures of the Middle Eastern area will now occupy our attention. Cases of established identity already referred to are concerned, essentially, with grave goods which are numerous and enable many interesting comparisons to be made. Nevertheless, the point must be stressed that owing to the prevailingly typological character of these very comparisons, the common features emerging do not permit direct correlations to be made either on the chronological or the ethnic-cultural level: the very differences existing between the various cultures we are speaking of clearly account for this. Let us begin by studying the large cinerary vases attested in the Swat region in the tombs of Period I. It will be noted that the rectangular urn and simple jar types both of which are characterised by holes and often decorated with carved anthropomorphic reliefs, have many features in common with analogous urns and jars recently discovered in some artificial caves in Palestine (4th millennium B.C.), that are provided with a quadrangular mouth surmounted by markedly protruding noses and large eyes recalling solar symbols (24). Intermediate parallels to this same feature ? between the Near East and Swat ? are at? tested at Khurab, Bampur and Katukan in Persian Makran (25). Turning to the typology of the vases, we note that the most common form among the grave goods of Period I ? the red cup set on a conical pedestal (type Cc/I and Cc/I-a) ? is also found at Tepe Hissar in phases II B (26) and III A (27), at Shah Tepe in phase II A (28), and in the deepest levels at Charsada (29), while a variant of it (type Cc/I-b) is pro? minent in the tombs of Cemetery R 37 at Harappa (30). The bell-shaped vase, also ? it is one of the most elaborate forms of grey and red thick-sided ware (types Ca/III and Cc/V) ? can be recognised fairly clearly in specimens coming from the most recent strata of Gawra (31), Tepe Hissar III B (32) and Mundigak IV (38) and can be identified, too, in a red type associated with the first settlements at Char? sada (34).

It can further be remarked that among Period I vases there is a close resemblance be? tween type Ca/I and vases found at Tepe Hissar III B (3?), at Hasanlu V (37) and Giyan I (38). The growing importance of incised grey pottery, fully attested in Swat in the tombs of Period II, was matched ? for the first time in the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent ? in the Jhangar culture in Sind that can be referred to the end of the second millenium (3*). A distinctive form among Swat grey ware (type Cb/VII) has been reported at Harappa in the intermediate level between Cemeteries R 37 and H (4(J), and at Chanhu-daro II in the Jhukar phase (41). Other forms of grey ware of the same period (types Cb/I, Cb/III, Cb/VI, Cb/VIII, Cb/XV) are attested in central India near the chalcolithic deposit of Navda Toli to which a date between 1200 and 700 B.C. has been provisionally assigned (42). The supremacy achieved by red, thin-sided ware of fine paste is corroborated in Swat in Period III tombs in relation to the diffusion of iron objects. This same transition can be perceived in the last period of the final phase at Tepe Hissar (43): it is marked by the replacement of grey by red ware, while (parallel with the spread of the iron industry) it is variously attested in the most recent phases at Giyan (44), Turang Tepe (45), and Sialk (46). At Charsada, too (4T), monochrome red ware sharply prevailed with a concomitant iron industry from the beginnings of the settlement down to the time when the so-called North? ern Black Polished Ware became prominent (about 550-300 B.C.). The correlations between the pottery industry of this locality and that of the Period III tombs of Swat can mainly be detected in the red cups of carinated profile (type Cd/IX) that at Charsada I are found in levels 47-38 (48). Moreover, in level 39 at Charsada the large red-type vase Cf/III (4S&gt;) is met with; it is almost the sole type of jar found in the Swat Period III tombs, while in earlier periods (?5) M.

At Charsada, however, all the biconical and hour-glass types are missing. These consti? tute the main group of vases in the Swat tombs of Period III and have striking structural affinities with forms found at Tepe Hissar III (51) and Hasanlu IV (52). A feature of undoubted archaic flavour in the final phase of the Swat necropolises is the presence of tiny flat idols fashioned sometimes in the shape of a violin (Type Cg/II) that are strikingly different from the anthropomorphic figurines of Periods I and II (type Cg/I) and instead recall fairly directly Anatolian specimens of the Chalcolithic Age (53). Uncertain as the origin of this production may appear, it seems germane to recall the indirect relations existing between Anatolian cultures of the early Bronze Age (Alishar H?y?k, Alaca H?y?k), and those of the late Bronze Age in north-east Persia (Tepe Hissar, Turang Tepe, Anau, which in the view of some authors would explain the progressive dif? fusion of red monochrome ware and kindred products (54) over the Iranian plateau. Regarding the typology of metal objects, we can note in the first place that the copper pin with a conical head (type Ma/III), associated with Swat Period I tombs, is to be related to a similar type found in the Veri cemeteries (Lenkoran, a region in the Soviet Caucasus) in tombs dating from the late Bronze Age (55). The large copper pin with big disk-head (type Ma/I), found in some tombs of Period II, has also come to light at Tepe Hissar III (56) whither it was probably brought from Koban by way of Luristan (57). The large copper pin, too, with globule surmounted by a small disk-head (type Ma/II), which was widespread in Swat tombs of Period II, is matched in finds at Koban in late Bronze Age tombs (58); while a variant of it with hat-shaped head (type Ma/II-a) is known to have been found at Anau (59), Giyan I (60) and Sialk VI (61). Before concluding this series of typological comparisons, we wish to mention some objects found in isolation in the Swat necropolises and matched by others elsewhere. A square grey bottle mounted on four feet (type Cb/XVI), a counterpart of which has come to light at Tepe Hissar III C (62), at Khurvin (63), and in Cemetery B at Sialk (64). (50) M.

This type of pottery matched to some extent at Sialk (76) and at Shah Tepe (7T) and a good deal in more distant south Russia (79) has been found in isolation in all three pe? riods of the culture of the Swat necropolises. This is a phenomenon of marked significance, for it shows that though this production was essentially alien to what was locally and ha? bitually used, it nevertheless exercised a fairly constant influence upon Swat culture in pre Buddhist times. * vV * The many foregoing comparisons prove that recorded cases of identity extend to dif? ferent cultures occasionally very distant in time, ranging from the third millennium to beyond the middle of the first millenium B.C. As we remarked at the beginning, in view of the essentially typological character of such comparisons, all correlation in terms of ab? solute chronology still seems premature to us. Among the various cross-references remarked upon, however, we think it is right to stress the analogies with pottery removed from the deepest levels at Charsada (6th-4th century B.C.). And the notable number of comparisons and the relatively short distance separating this locality from Swat are not the sole reasons; for the features in common go beyond the moulded form of vases and comprise the colour of the paste, the surface colouring, and at times even certain singular aspects of the firing.

Further indications await the results of anthropological research (determination of the sex, age and racial type of the dead persons\ of analyses throwing light on clothing (carried out on soil samples collected near the skull and pelvis of the buried persons), and tests in search of food remains (carried out on soil samples collected from the bottom of vases placed in the tombs). The latter, indeed, may allow us to trace the principal means of the commu? nity's livelihood ? that is, the prevailing form of its economic activity (79). Giorgio Stacul NOTE.
