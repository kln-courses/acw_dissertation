<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liminality and Incorporation in the Art of the Tlingit Shaman by Aldona Jonaitis TLINGIT SHAMANS, who possessed potent supernatural forces, used many magically powerful artworks during curing ceremonies.They also manipulated other artworks which clearly embodied social order and profane structure. These seemingly contradictory qualities-spir- itual potency and secular structure-are actually complementary ar- tistic aspects that helped facilitate the shaman's curing rituals, which can best be understood as rites of passage. In this paper, we will discuss the art of the Tlingit shaman from the perspective of how certain pieces communicated the sacredness of the liminal phase of the rite of passage, while others conveyed its incorporative phase. Since both the symbolism and the style of these carvings embodied ritual meaning, this paper will analyze the complementary, and often intricately interconnected, iconographic and formal elements of Tlingit shamanic art. The symbolic meaning of four animals depicted on these pieces-land otters, octopus, ravens and killer whales-and of three types of articles- masks, charms and raven rattles-as well as the significance of the style of charms and raven rattles will be related to liminality and incorporation. Liminality and incorporation are, however, specific expressions of the general notions of the sacred and the profane within the Tlingit world view. Thus, before the shaman's artworks can be analyzed iconographically and formally, it will be necessary first to discuss shamanism proper within the context of the Tlingit views on spirituality and secularity. Tlingit shamanism as we shall describe it was practiced during the nineteenth century; most of the artwork we shall analyze was collected at the end of that century.' Tlingit Shamanism The Tlingit shaman of sourtheastern Alaska presented a striking image. In August 1886, an English travel writer, Heywood Seton Karr, observed a Yakutat shaman trying to cure a child who had been accidentally poisoned with arsenic, and described him as follows (Seton-Karr 1887: 128-9): 41</page><page sequence="2">42 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 The interior of the house was lit up by the firelight. The shawaan was seated, naked to the waist, performing incantations and machinations over a sick child, though the child itself was no-where visible. His long hair, always left uncut, was streaming behind him. He was shaking his charms, throwing his body into contortions, uttering shrill cries, hissing and extending his arms, groaning and breathing through his clenched teeth, jerking himself meantime in convulsive starts in cadence to the music. This quote portrays the Tlingit shaman as a bizarre eccentric. Indeed, his appearance was striking, and most unlike the typical Northwest Coast villager. The wild and unkempt shaman never cut his fingernails or his hair, and, when he performed, wore a roughly cut hide apron from which was suspended deer dew claws and puffin bills, a crown of spikes that aggressively projected up towards the heavens, and a necklace of carved and uncarved ivory and bone charms. Sometimes he shook bird-formed rattles, and by doing so, called the spirits to his side. Sometimes he donned a series of masks, transforming into an assortment of supernatural beings. Although the Tlingit shaman looked distinctly different from his fellow villagers, who always appeared with neatly cut hair and elegantly refined costumes, it would be quite wrong to conclude that he was a misfit or a social outcast, for, in actuality, the shaman was an esteemed and valued member of the community who enjoyed a status equal to that of the aristocrats who headed the most prestigious lineages in the village. Shamans and nobles both ensured the continuation of life: the nobles, by exerting secular power, controlled the daily activities of the villagers; the shaman, by displaying spiritual powers, controlled the witches and other malevolents who caused disease, death, bad weather and warfare. Thus, despite his unusual appearance, the Tlingit shaman was an extremely important member of his village and per- formed a role that complemented that of the secular leaders. One thing especially connected the shaman and the elite, namely, their use of artworks to enhance their respective positions. To com- municate their high status the nobility displayed images of crests, which were animals that symbolized their clans. Crests appeared all over: men wore Chilkat blankets decorated with highly abstract crest emblems, and wooden hats modeled with naturalistic crest animals; screens (fig. 10) and posts inside communal houses contained painted and sculpted crests; even storage boxes, food dishes and spoons were replete with these clan symbols. These crest images had little, if any, religious content. In contrast to the profane nature of crests, shamans carved and wore objects decorated with images of their supernatural spirit helpers, called yek, which could appear in the form of either</page><page sequence="3">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 43 animals or humans. Yek decorated all sorts of shamanic paraphernalia, such as masks, rattles and charms, and, because they themselves had supernatural power, enhanced the spiritual potency of the objects upon which they appeared. The shaman's splendid array of magical art functioned to ensure the success of his therapeutic rituals. It did so, however, by an interesting process which included the conveying of magical, otherwordly qualities inherent in the objects and profane qualities similar to those of crest art. It is necessary now to review several aspects of the Tlingit world- view which are relevant to this interpretation of Tlingit shamanic art. By analyzing Tlingit ethnographies and myths, it becomes clear that these people perceived a difference between the world of the village and the world of nature beyond the village.2 The village, governed by social rules and led by the elite nobility, was the concrete embod- iment of the structured, profane arena of human order. Each traditional Tlingit village consisted of a neat row of well-constructed houses, positioned according to the relative statuses of their inhabitants. The village plan, with the houses of the elite clustered in the center and those of the less prestigious inhabitants positioned on the periphery, presented an image of Tlingit social structure, with its hierarchical ordering of clans and individuals. By its very organization, planned and executed by humans, the village was a clear statement of human control over a portion of the Tlingit environment. In contrast, the Tlingit did not control at all the natural areas around their villages. Each Tlingit village faced water-either a river, an inlet or an ocean bay-and was flanked on its sides and back by dense forest and towering mountains. These high, craggy, virtually impassable mountains, mys- terious, decaying, overgrown forests, and lonely, desolate waters, were the wild and dangerous abodes of spirits. Malevolent supernaturals, particularly witches, who caused disease and death, resided in these natural areas, as did vek, the shaman's spirit helpers: The village was safe and structured, whereas the world beyond the village was full of potent supernaturals. The Tlingit theory of disease and, as we shall see, the efficacy of therapeutic art, relates directly to this secular/village: sacred/nature dichotomy. A healthy individual was one who lived, contentedly and well functioning, in the structured, profane and, especially, safe, world of the village. He or she became sick when a witch took something from him or her, perhaps some hair or nail clippings, a piece of torn, discarded clothing, or a morsel of uneaten food, and transported it into the wild and dangerous forest area. When part of a victim of witchcraft was removed from the village and transported to the forest area, he or she became ill.3 To cure this patient, the shaman had to</page><page sequence="4">44 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 engage in a variety of practices. Sometimes he cured the bewitched victim by simply shaking his body, singing, dancing and brandishing sacred artworks; these physical displays were frequently sufficient to subdue the witch and force him to release his hold on the patient. At other times, the shaman had to resort to more drastic therapies, which consisted of identifying and torturing the witch. Among the Tlingit, witches were members of the realm of nature who, however, assumed the form of villagers. Although these witches sometimes displayed abnormal behavior such as propensity to incest, only a shaman could identify a witch with any certainty. At a witch-identifying ritual, the shaman dressed up in full regalia and entered a house full of all the village residents. After entering into a trance, the shaman went to each person and finally pointed to the witch amongst them. If the witch, at that point, confessed to having performed sorcery, and returned the hair or nail clippings, torn clothing or uneaten food to the victim, the sick person quickly recovered. In effect, part of the victim was returned from nature to society. If, however, the accused individual denied having performed witchcraft, then he was bound with his hands behind his back, deprived of food and water, and sometimes beaten until he confessed. If the witch still refused to admit what he had done, he was allowed to starve to death or was placed on the shore at the limit of the low tide and drowned as the water rose. Certain rattles (fig. 1) depict the scene of a shaman torturing a witch on the back of oyster catcher birds. This description of a shamanic cure deals with what the shaman actually did to the witch but explains neither how the shaman mustered up power sufficient to overcome the witch, nor the mechanism by which the patient actually became well. Donald Sandner (1978) has suggested that shamanism is a process of healing, in which the shaman manipulates certain symbols to effect a cure. To understand the symbolic aspect of Tlingit healing, we must go beyond the simple narrative of what the shaman did and analyze the symbolic meaning of his activities. The method by which we shall do this is an analysis of the various types of objects manipulated by the shaman during his healing rituals. We shall see those artworks very clearly express the symbolic process of shamanic therapy: certain artworks provide the shaman with magical power from the world of nature, while others, embodying the structure of the profane world, ensure the recovery of the patient. To understand how this is done, we must analyze the structure of the shaman's curing ritual, since his artwork functions symbolically during that ritual process. When the Tlingit shaman had to cure a bewitched individual, he left the safe, structured village in which he resided, and entered into</page><page sequence="5">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 45 the domain of the supernatural, the area in which witches and other malevolent creatures lived. Even if, during a curing seance, the shaman seemed to stay in one place, he symbolically transported himself, often in trance state, to that "other" world. His passage into and out of the world beyond the village, like any passage into and out of the sacred, was accompanied by symbols of the three phases of the rite of passage that Arnold van Gennep (1960) many years ago identified: separation, liminality and incorporation. When illness made it nec- essary for the Tlingit shaman to venture into the natural world, he did not simply leave his community, and then return, for that would have been enormously dangerous. Instead, he underwent a transitional ritual in which he eased out of the profane social state during a rite of separation, existed for a time in the supernatural liminal state, and then safely settled back into his social group during the incor- porative phase. The shaman's ritual of separation occured when he removed his normal, everyday clothing and donned his distinctive and different costume, replete with charms, rattles and crowns. The middle phase of this rite was that of liminality. For the sha- manic passage into the supernatural, this was the experience of pro- found spiritual potency. Although van Gennep concerned himself only slightly with this intermediate phase, Victor Turner has written about it extensively. The supernatural conditions are defined by Turner in terms of opposition to secularity. In The Ritual Process (1969:91), he offers a valuable description of liminality by proposing a series of characteristics that are opposed to or even reversals of secular char- acteristics. These pairs, with the first element being liminal, the second being secular, include: transition/state; totality/partiality; homogeneity/ heterogeneity; absence of status/status; unclear sexual differences/ clear sexual differences; sacredness/secularity; continuous reference to mystical powers/intermittent reference to mystical powers. When the Tlingit shaman passed through the phase of liminality, he acted not like a man but instead like a spirit, his personality was no longer human but instead merged with his yek, his perception of reality was not "normal" but instead was "altered."4 He was no longer a member of structured profane society but was instead temporarily integrated into the world of the sacred. As Turner has shown, liminality is a profoundly powerful condition; the Tlingit shaman's liminality provided him with the power to combat and overcome the witches who caused disease and death. As we shall see shortly, many artworks displayed by the Tlingit shaman communicated this powerful liminality. After experiencing the intense spirituality of liminality, the Tlingit shaman had to return to his group." The process of incorporation, usually manifested in Tlingit shamanism by manipulation of symbols</page><page sequence="6">46 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 associated with secularity and structure, did not simply ensure the shaman of a safe return to his community, for it also functioned to reintegrate the patient into his social group. Several scholars, including Levi-Strauss (1963), who analyzed the rituals of various Native Amer- ican shamans, Turner (1968) who wrote on African Ndembu doctors, Sandner (1978), who investigated Navajo medicine men and Douglas (1976), who discussed shamanism from a theoretical perspective, have described how one of the primary responsibilities of symbolic healers is to reintegrate their patients, whose illnesses have alienated them from their communities, back to their social groups. In order to rein- tegrate these patients, the shaman must manipulate commonly ac- cepted symbols of order which he then imposes on them. The symbols of order projected over the Tlingit patient, which provide him with a mechanism to return to good health, are a display of artworks which communicate the safe and structured world of human organization. Before we proceed to analyze Tlingit shamanic art from this per- spective of liminality and incorporation, we must briefly provide some background on how men became shamans among the Tlingit. The selection and initiation process of a Tlingit shaman is, itself, a rite of passage. One did not decide to become a shaman, but had first to be selected by spirits and then be properly initiated by them during an expedition into the sacred realm of the forest. Since shamanism among the Tlingit was usually inherited, the individual so chosen was normally the son or nephew of another shaman. Spirits could indicate their choice by appearing in a future shaman's dream, or they could cause severe illness which was cured only when he accepted his calling. If a young man so selected tried to refuse, the spirits followed him and harassed him mercilessly until he submitted to their wishes. Before he could become a practicing shaman, the recently selected novice had to go on a vision quest during which he acquired super- natural power that would make him an accomplished shaman. This quest was an eight-day expedition into the woods or onto a deserted beach during which the novice ate nothing and only drank salt water. In order, therefore, for the Tlingit shaman to acquire power, he had to leave his structured profane village and become a member of the wild domain of the sacred. The shaman's departure from his community was an act of separation, and his temporary residence in the woods or beach, a passage through liminality. As he sat, isolated and hungry, a series of animals came to him, protruded their tongues at him, spun several times and then fell dead at his feet. These strangely behaving animals were actually the sources of the novice's shamanic powers, for they embodied the sacred yek, potent spirit helpers that could</page><page sequence="7">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 47 appear in either human or animal form. The locus of their powers was their protruding tongues, which the shaman excised and kept as potent charms. After he returned to his village at the end of his eight- day expedition, he had an artist carve and paint images of those animals he had encountered on his magical implements.6 Before a shaman could actually practice, he had to have a public initiation in his village. This event took place in a large communal house before all assembled villagers who sang, beat drums and danced. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of the shaman and his sacred paraphernalia. The magical artworks came first, lowered dramatically through the smoke hole in the center of the roof. Then, suddenly the shaman appeared, plunging towards the fire, falling unconscious on the ground, contorting his body convulsively. He then picked up his sacred artworks, displaying the array of yek he possessed. This public initiation complemented the shaman's isolated vision quest, for the expedition into the woods signified his venture into liminality and consequent connection with the spiritual world, while the public demonstration before the lay community signified his reincorporation into this social group and reinforced his affiliation with the structured realm of the village. Although his vision quest confirmed the shaman's comfort in the world of witches and yek-a world he would soon have to return to during a curing ritual-his public initiation indicated his membership in his secular community and functioned to assure its members' health and welfare. Tlingit shamans owned many pieces of art, all of which were quite powerful. However, some had strong symbolic references to the liminality of the spiritual world, while others had ties to the rein- corporative structure of society. The former provided the shaman with power, the latter offered his patient a structure into which he or she could reintegrate. Liminality and incorporation is evident in the types of animals chosen to be yek, the actual types of artworks manipulated by shamans, and the style of those pieces. Shamanic Animals Land Otters and Octopus Although all yek on Tlingit shamanic art were sacred, some animals were particularly potent. The most powerful shamanic spirit helpers were the land otter and the octopus, or devilfish, which were said to embody the spiritual force of shamanism more profoundly than any other yek. Both of these creatures are very much animals of the wild domain of nature and as such, can be thought of as liminal. Land otters appear on more shamanic artworks than any other single yek (Jonaitis 1978). On the mask in fig. 2, land otters crouch</page><page sequence="8">48 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 on an anthropomorphic spirit's chin, cheeks and brow. The uppermost pair of land otters flank a wolf that emerges aggressively from the spirit's brow. A land otter also appears on the chest of the tortured witch perched on the back of the oyster catcher rattle in fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a complicated charm depicting a land otter. Why was this relatively small mink-like mammal, a harmless enough creature to all except the fish it ate, such an important and frequently-represented yek? The answer lies in the Tlingit perception of this animal, or should we say, this monster, since the land otter was not a typical animal at all, but instead a werewolf-like hybrid of human and animal. The Tlingit believed that anyone who drowned did not really die but instead turned slowly into a land otter; hair began growing all over his body, his arms shortened into land otter paws, a small tail started to grow, and then he ran wild in the world of the forest and the river. It could at will transform back to human form. When any Tlingit encountered a land otter, he became terrified, for what he saw was not merely an animal, but really a transformed human, who would try to drown any other human it met in order to turn him into a land otter.7 Land otters also had great powers over natural phenomena, for they caused stormy weather, created lethal avalanches and toppled the tallest trees, and caused horrible skin diseases, severe mental illnesses, and death. Worse, as the intimate physical relationship manifested in the oyster catcher rattle reveals, land otters were close allies of witches. The other potent spirit helper of the shaman was the octopus or devilfish (Jonaitis 1980). Although octopus sometimes appear as com- plete creatures, as is the case in the charm in fig. 4, they often appear simply as a series of tentacles or even, as is the case in the oyster catcher rattle in fig. 1, a row of suckers. Like the land otter, the octopus was thought of as a vicious monster, capable of destroying entire villages at will and causing personal harm to individuals. And, like the land otter, the octopus was intimately associated with the witch. The octopus was a most unusual creature: its eight-armed body shaped was unlike that of any other animal of the sea, it could transform its color and surface texture at will, and it could inflict a painful, venomous bite from its bird-beak-like mouth. It is not surprising that the Tlingit would credit an anomolous creature like the octopus with great super- natural powers. Both land otters and octopus were beings of the wild world beyond the village: the land otter lived in the forests and rivers, while the octopus resided in the sea. By controlling these two animals of the natural world surrounding the village, the Tlingit shaman could have within himself some of its powers. In addition, by possessing yek that were associated with witches, the shaman could divert their negative</page><page sequence="9">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 49 force into positive acts. Because both animals can transform-the land otter can change at will into a human, while the octopus can alter its color and texture-they also can be thought of as liminal. Land otters and octopus, therefore, lived almost entirely in the world of nature, possessed powers that the shaman could find very useful, and symbolized liminality. Ravens and Killer Whales While magical power was invested in land otters and octopus social order was inherent in certain other animals, particularly ravens and killer whales. We mentioned earlier that certain animals appeared as crest emblems of social units; as such, they are clear symbols of secular order. Although land otters and octopus, quite appropriately, almost never appear on Tlingit secular art as crests, ravens and killer whales are commonly seen as clan emblems. Thus, when these two animals are illustrated as yek, they allude not only to the shaman's experiences in the world of the spirit, but also to the order of the human domain. In other words, when an animal that appears regularly in a secular context appears in a sacred context, it brings with it some of its secular, structured associations. I would argue that when the Tlingit shaman displayed an image of a raven or killer whale, he created a visual symbol of the safe, profane human world-the world into which the patient could reintegrate. Although we might associate the killer whale (fig. 5) with ferocity and danger, the Tlingit believed that this sea mammal was a friend of man and helped him hunt other sea animals. According to myth, the killer whale was not originally a creature of the sea; indeed, it was not even originally a being of nature. Legend has it that a carver first modelled a killer whale out of red cedar and then put it into the water. This man-made animal then proceeded to help its creator by killing in revenge his evil and nasty brothers-in-law. After performing this service, the killer whale swam away to live forever in the sea as a helper of man. Myths about the raven also describe his importance to humans. Although this bird did not actually create the world, he transformed it from its original form to the shape it has today. For example, he formed mountains and oceans from a primeval mass. At one time people had no fresh water to drink, since the evil petrel kept it hoarded up in his house. Raven, seeing that humans needed water to survive, stole it from the petrel and gave it to man. Likewise, raven liberated the sun, moon and stars from a box so that humans could see. Although the raven was also known to act selfishly, piggishly and cruelly, he</page><page sequence="10">50 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 remained always intimately connected to humans. The Tlingit credit him with having established much of human culture, including house- building, myth-telling, and even shamanism. When the Tlingit shaman displayed artworks, such as the raven charm in fig. 6, that depicted this bird, he declared his closeness with the profane world and its orderly structure. The Tlingit shaman possessed some animals which myth and legends described as powerful and of the world beyond the village, and other animals that sometimes appear as crests, which seem far more closely affiliated with humans, since stories about them describe their friendships to men. All four animals discussed here have, by virtue of being yek, spiritual power; however, the Tlingit credit certain animals, specifically the land otter and octopus, with especially intense power. Other relatively less potent animals, like the killer whale and raven, have a connection to the secular world which offers the shaman a symbol of structure which facilitates the reintegration of his patient back to his group. Shamanic Artworks Masks and Charms Certain animals provided the shaman with especially intense powers; certain types of artworks did the same. Two of the most magical artworks owned by the Tlingit shaman were masks and charms. Perhaps the most valuable of these was the mask (fig. 2), which allowed the shaman symbolically to leave his village and enter the world of the supernatural; more than any other article, the mask allowed the shaman transit into liminality. Shamans owned an assortment of masks, each of which represented different yek under his command. During a healing seance, he put one mask onto his face, transforming into the yek it depicted. Then he took it off, put another one on, transforming into a different yek. This went on until he transformed into all the yek at his disposal. In an article on Tlingit shaman's masks (Jonaitis 1982), I describe the masking scenario of a shaman who owned eight masks: a wolf, kingfisher, hawk, old woman, young man, spirit with octopus, shaman with land otter and octopus, and warrior. When the shaman entered the house of a sick individual, he was dressed like others in his community and was quite obviously a member of their social group. Then he donned his first mask, turning into a wolf. Then he turned, in sequence, into the other spirits depicted on his collection of masks. This process of donning a series of masks and transforming sequentially into yek was a process by which the shaman left secular society and entered the liminal world of the spirit.</page><page sequence="11">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 51 When the Tlingit shaman entered the house, he was a member of a profane society. Then he transformed into several animals, an old woman, and several young males. During the process, he disre- garded the rules of social order which governed his group, by becoming several different beings of different ages living in different locales. By becoming both male and female, he confused the differentiation between the sexes; by becoming both animal and human he confounded the distinction between nature and culture; by becoming both old and young, he blurred linear time. As he donned more and more of his masks, he successively obscured the distinctions and definitions that were the foundation of social order. By the end of his masking ritual, he had experienced transition, achieved totality by virtue of having become everything and blurred definitions between them, and lost all social and sexual status; in other words, he passed into liminality. Tlingit masking rituals provided shamans with enormous supernatural power which was probably due to the fact that masks could project the shaman beyond the world of structure into the realm of the super natural. Another item of shamanic paraphernalia that was especially valuable was the charm. Although the documentation on charms is scantier than it is on masks, it appears that when a shaman wanted his yek to surround him during a seance, he would hold up his charms which then became filled with the spiritual essence of the yek depicted on each. A shaman's charm was a unique work of art, unlike all other charms, because its imagery was the artistic rendition of the individual shaman's encounters with spirits he became while in a trance. Perhaps because they were illustrations of visionary experiences, shaman's charms have a dreamlike, mystical quality. Figures on charms flow into one another, transform abruptly into completely other creatures, interact with one another in fantastic ways. Let us look for a moment at the land otter charm in fig. 3. While much non-shamanic crest art of the Tlingit is rigidly symmetrical (fig. 10) this charm is distinctively assymmetrical. The land otter has a large head with a protruding tongue extending over his forehead. Nestled in his mouth, perhaps being ingested, perhaps being spewed forth, is a crouching, anthro- pomorphic skeletal figure. As one looks to the tail area, one is surprised by the appearance of a bird-like head in place of a tail. Even more perplexing is the rear leg of the land otter which seems to be the foreleg of the avian tail-being. Clearly, normal profane logic is dis- regarded in the creation of this charm, with its assymmetric repre- sentation of transformation, and illogical organization of images. The</page><page sequence="12">52 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 world of social structure is orderly and organized; this charm, with its lack of orderliness and organization, is a reflection of the supernatural world. Raven Rattles Only shamans could own charms and wear decorated masks,8 perhaps because they were magical artworks of the spiritual domain. Interestingly, the Tlingit shaman also owned other artworks which they shared with the laiety, the most distinctive being the raven (fig. 7). This bird-shaped instrument was so commonly associated with the elite that some Tlingit called it a "chief's rattle" (Swanton 1980:453). It was also found among other Northwest Coast groups; indeed, the Tsimshian are credited with its invention. Such an object, usually associated with the nobility, can be thought of, like the image of the raven itself, as a symbol of profane order. When the shaman carried the raven rattle, he expressed a connection with secular society, and could impose its structure over his patient during the process of therapy. Another element of society's structure is inherent in the arrange ment of images on the raven rattle. As we mentioned above, charms were all unique illustrations of different visions; in contrast, the form of the raven itself and the arrangement of figures on its back are extremely regular. Almost all raven rattles depict on the back of a very conventionalized raven, a reclining man, connected to a frog or a bird by a protruding tongue. The remarkable regularity of these instruments communicates a kind of regimentation and orderliness quite different from the freedom of composition on the charm. The order of the human world is similarly founded in regimentation and consistency very different from the freedom and individualism of the supernatural domain. In the secular sphere, individualistic behavior is suspect; indeed, if a man disregards too many social rules, he will be branded a witch. The proper behavior of the individual in society is conformity to its mores. The raven rattle, with its analogous con- formity of composition, communicates this significant aspect of Tlingit social order. Mary Douglas (1973:49-5 1) has, in an analysis of cultural expressions of social structure, proposed that consistency, regimen- tation, and subordination of the individual to the group are all char- acteristics of profane structure. The conventionalized, uniform raven rattle, by following rules that are analogous to social rules, can be thought of as a manifestation of secularity, and by extension, of in corporation.</page><page sequence="13">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 53 Formality and Informality We tend to associate Northwest Coast art with elegance and re- finement, for certainly, most examples of sculpture and painting pub- lished in books on Northwest Coast culture are masterpieces of this sophisticated and complex style. It would be very wrong, however, to assume that all Tlingit shamanic artworks are gorgeous examples of "formline" style, a term coined by Bill Holm in his significant analysis of Northwest Coast style (1965). Indeed, while most Tlingit shamans owned some artworks, such as the charm in fig. 8, that adhered to all the conventions of the style, they also often possessed other, such as the Janus-faced killer whale charm in fig. 9, that rejected most of those conventions. Let us call this particular contrast in style "formal" (artwork that adheres to conventions), and "informal" (art- work that rejects conventions). To understand the symbolic significance of informality and formality in Tlingit shamanic art, we must again return to the Tlingit perception of the world. As we discussed in relation to the raven rattle, the profane, orderly world of the village is subject to rules and regulations that assure safe existence for its inhabitants. Within the village numerous rules have been established which govern the creation of artworks. Although this is not the place for a detailed analysis of Northwest Coast formal conventions it is necessary briefly to analyze the style of a typical Tlingit painting that adheres to these artistic rules. The screen in fig. 10 was originally placed at the rear of a communal house of a lineage in Angoon. It displays definite symmetry, has delicately applied paint, and is characterized by the exquisite, calligraphic-like swelling and narrowing bands, called formlines, that surround the design elements. The artist who created this masterwork was trained in an elaborate set of design principles which he was expected to follow carefully. Excessive creativity and personal expression were severely limited, while brilliance in the application of these design principles was enthusiastically applauded. The rules and regulations that governed social behavior were analogous to the rules and regulations that gov- erned the creation of art; thus, artworks that adhered to secular, formal conventions can be thought of as embodying the principles of social structure. The world of nature beyond the orderly line of houses which constitutes a village was, in contrast, a wild and unstructured place. Certainly one could argue that some kind of logical organization of the liminal arena existed, but it would certainly not have been the same as that of the village. Indeed, if we are to accept Durkheim's</page><page sequence="14">54 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 (1915) and Mauss' (1972) theories that the sacred is conceptualized as the reversal of the profane, the structure of the Tlingit world of nature was the opposite of that of the village. To extend this concept to art, we can propose that those objects which ignored or rejected the Tlingit formal, conventional stylistic principles-namely, those pieces which are comparatively informal-are manifestations of the world beyond structure, the realm of nature (Jonaitis 1983). The two charms we are discussing are examples of this formal/ informal contrast. The killer whale charm (fig. 9) is roughly incised and very simply ornamented, while the animal charm (fig. 10) displays elegant formline bands around the mouth and eyes, and has subtle, gentle transitions of relief planes between the various bands. Detailed, precise cross-hatching gives a gentle shading utterly absent in the killer whale piece. The Northwest Coast artist typically paid a great deal of attention to the eyes. On the animal charm, the eye is a delicate oval. The plane of the eye itself is accentuated by an incised oval, and is separated from the rest of the face by a beautifully sculpted channel which sets it off from the formline band surrounding it. How different is the eye of the killer whale charm, an unmodulated circle with a dot in its center and two lines extending out from either side. The animal charm, because it adheres to the socially-sanctioned principles of Northwest Coast style can be thought of as conveying concepts of secular order and thus as a symbol of incorporation. The killer whale piece, in contrast, because it almost purposefully seems to be rejecting those rules, seem unsophisticated, unrefined and even undisciplined. It clearly belongs to the realm of the supernatural. Thus, like the animals depicted on Tlingit shamanic art, and the types of objects used by the shaman, the very stylistic qualities of artworks com- municate either liminality or incorporation. Conclusion The Tlingit shaman's principle responsibility was to protect his villagers from witches and other malevolent supernaturals. Since he was the only individual in his community capable of interacting on an equal basis with these creatures of the world beyond the village, he must be seen as a powerful supernatural individual in his own right. He was surrounded by an aura of spiritual power, and his art- works-all of them-had magical strength. Thus, any shamanic ob- jects-a mask, charm, or rattle, decorated with a land otter, octopus, raven or killer whale, executed in formal or informal style, was a sacred implement. The process of shamanic therapy was, however, a rite of passage for both the shaman and his patient into and back out of the world</page><page sequence="15">JONAITIS: THE ART OF THE TLINGIT SHAMAN 55 of the spirit. This symbolic venture from social order to liminality back to social order was accompanied by artworks which symbolized either the magic power of the spiritual realm or the order and safety of the human arena. In many cases, individual artworks embraced both facets of the healing rite of passage: the raven and two killer whale charms convey liminality in that they are magical objects, but communicate incorporation in that they depict yek that also appear as crests; the killer whale in fig. 8 is also incorporative because its style is so informal; the mask (fig. 2) is liminal since it represents the magical land otters, but incorporative because it also depicts a wolf, which is a major crest animal, and it has been carved magnificently, according to Northwest Coast formal conventions. When we first look at complete assortments of Tlingit shamanic paraphernalia we see a mind-boggling amalgamation of rather dis- similar objects. The dissimilarity of these objects actually functions to reflect the opposition between nature and culture, and to enable the shaman symbolically to cure his patient. Although we can no longer share Heywood Seton-Karr's extraordinary experience of ob- serving a Tlingit shaman performing, we can still reflect in awe and appreciation, on the superb artworks the shaman owned and used, artworks that symbolized on the one hand magical potency and the power of the natural world, and on the other hand, secular order and the structure of the village. We can still appreciate in Tlingit shamanic art these two complementary aspects of the healing process. NOTES 1. See Jonaitis 1981 for an extensive theoretical discussion of how artworks can symbolize the phases of a rite of passage into and out of spirituality. 2. The information upon which this paper is based comes from the following sources: Emmons n.d. A, n.d. B. n.d. C, de Laguna 1972, Oberg 1973, Krause 1956, Olson 1967, Swanton 1908, 1909. 3. For descriptions of shamanic cures, see Krause 1956:200-3, Swanton 1980:464, Olson 1967:112-15, de Laguna 1972:708-15. 4. One of the characteristics of shamanism is the alteration of consciousness. Silverman (1967) and Peters and Price-Williams (1980) offer psychological explanations for this mental change. Others, like Mandell (1979) and Reichell-Dolmatoff (1964) ascribe it to changes in the brain chemistry. This question of the shaman's altered state of consciousness and its causes is by no means settled. 5. Shamans and witches of the Tlingit share certain characteristics: both travel with ease into the world beyond the village; both transform readily into animals; both have supernatural powers. The principal difference between the two has to do with the group's perceptions of each: a witch is an utterly despised, antisocial being while the shaman is a highly-respected important member of the community. It is therefore most important for the Tlingit shaman, after venturing into the world of the spirit, to</page><page sequence="16">56 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1983 return safely to the group to which he belongs. See Swanton 1980:469-72, Olson 1967:116- 17, de Laguna 1972:728-43. 6. Some shamanic artworks are handed down from generation to generation to be used by shamans in the same lineage; others, however, are newly created after the shaman's vision quest (Emmons n.d.A, n.d.B, n.d.C). 7. The Tlingit, like so many Native Americans, believe that in mythic times, animals could transform readily into human form. However, only land otters retained that ability into "modern" times Emmons n.d.A, n.d.B, n.d.C). 8. Although some undecorated masks were worn at potlatches, they were by no means as common in the secular context as they were in the sacred sphere (de Laguna 1972:823). FIGURES 1. Oyster catcher rattle. Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology, Leningrad. Photo after Siebert and Foreman (1967). The body of this rattle represents the oyster catcher, a shorebird of Alaska. In lieu of a tail is the head of a mountain goat whose tongue protrudes over its forehead to form a platform upon which squats a witch. A shaman is torturing this witch, from whose chest is emerging a land otter. 2. Mask. American Museum of Natural History, New York City. Photo courtesy of the Museum. The face of this mask is that of a shaman. Emerging from his forehead is a wolf; crouching on his brow, cheeks and chin are six land otters. 3. Charm. Museum of the American Indian, New York City. Photo courtesy of the Museum. The body of this charm represents a land otter. Nestled in its mouth is a crouching, profile, skeletal human. Instead of a tail is a bird-like face. 4. Charm. Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum, Seattle. Photo author. This charm represents an octopus with a bird-like face. 5. Charm. American Museum of Natural History. Photo courtesy of the Museum. This charm represents a killer whale with a small torso of an anthropomorphic being in its dorsal fin. 6. Charm. Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. Photo author. This ivory charm, inlaid with abalone shell, represents the head and neck of the raven. 7. Raven rattles. American Museum of Natural History. Photo courtesy of the Museum. The upper rattle was owned by a shaman, whereas the lower one was owned by a layman. Both rattles are strikingly similar in their composition: each depicts a broad-billed raven; each has a long-billed bird at its tail facing a reclining man; each has beings connected by tongues. This comparison highlights the similarity between secular and sacred raven rattles. 8. Charm. American Museum of Natural History. Photo M. Petroske. This ex- quisitely-carved charm depicts an animal. 9. Charm. American Museum of Natural History. Photo courtesy of the Museum. This crudely-carved charm depicts a Janus-faced killer whale. 10.
