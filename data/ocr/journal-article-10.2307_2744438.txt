There are, however, a number of methodological and substantive issues which may undermine her argument that a transformation in representations of women from genetrix to mater reflects an emerging patriarchal order concomitant with increased social stratification. Methodologically it can be argued that there is no nec- essary correlation between the representation of women as child-bearers or as child-rearers, on the one hand, and the status of women as independently in control of themselves and their bodies or as subservient to domi- nant males, on the other. While all images undoubtedly carried overt or covert messages of some kind, the spe- cific symbolism imputed to the different forms of female figure cannot be justified, especially in the light of the more substantive and specific issues listed below: I. The essential interpretation of contrasting levels of social organisation in later prehistoric Cyprus is far from established. The views of Manning (I993) and Knapp (1993) notwithstanding, a strong case can be made for a relatively egalitarian social system in the Early and Mid- dle Bronze Age (e.g., Frankel I993) no more and perhaps even less complex than societies of the Late Chalco- lithic. Early and Middle Bronze Age Cypriot society need have been no less "communal" than that of earlier pe- riods. 2. The emphasis on flat, rectangular "plank idols" de- tracts from the significance of the numerous other terra- cotta models of the Early and Middle Bronze Age. These show women engaged in a wide variety of tasks, some more domestic or industrial, others, almost certainly, of formal ritual. Women cannot be seen as iconographi- cally (hence symbolically) relegated to the single role of mother. 3. Even if plank-shaped figurines are regarded as privi- leged symbolic representations of women, it is impor- tant to note that the majority, whether free-standing or attached to vessels, do not carry infants. An argument for an overriding association of these figures with woman as mater is therefore hard to sustain. In addition it should be noted that the basic style and technique would make biological depiction of pregnancy impos- sible. 5. Bolger regards the Bronze Age figures as more stan- dardised than the Chalcolithic ones, with the implica- tion that this reflects a particular categorization of women. While measures of homogeneity and diversity are especially difficult when dealing with artefacts of different materials and styles, to my Bronze Age eye there appears to be no less and possibly even more uni- formity among the Chalcolithic cruciform figures. 6. The unique set of figurines from Kissonerga, includ- ing one in the act of giving birth, may lend substance to the broader interpretation of other Chalcolithic figu- rines, both of clay and stone, as linked to pregnancy (and even, by extension, "birthing rituals"), but the sugges- tion that there are no Early or Middle Bronze Age depic- tions of pregnancy is false. The well-known bowl from Marki in the Pierides Collection (Karageorghis I99I:I20, pIs. 28, 79) explicitly depicts pregnancy and childbirth in a context that can be seen as showing a full cycle from conception onward (other male/female couples such as those seen on this bowl are also known). Childbirth cannot be regarded as a closed or excluding act. 7. The discussion of provenance is something of a red herring. Certainly the exact find-spot from which many "plank idols" come is not known, but there is little doubt that they were found in tombs. Their context of final deposition is not problematic. While full prove- nance would allow regional and chronological analyses and a better assessment of their frequency, it would probably not assist in developing a better understanding of their function. 8. Not all "plank idols" come from funerary deposits. Several are known from settlements (e.g., Frankel and Webb I993:58, fig. 9, pl. 3), although none as de facto refuse or as specific deposits such as that of the Chalco- lithic set from Kissonerga. At least one example from the settlement at Marki was broken and mended in an- tiquity before being discarded (Mogelonsky i988:287, fig. 25). These figurines therefore functioned in both set- tlement and funerary contexts, were sometimes re- paired, and were commonly discarded as normal refuse when broken. What they represented and how they were used or perceived are totally unknown. The transition in the mid- to late 3d millennium B.C. from the Chalcolithic to the very different material, technological, and symbolic world of the Bronze Age has always been a matter of considerable debate. It may have been heavily influenced by migration or colonisation from Anatolia (Frankel, Eslick, and Webb i995). One component of the new order was a different depiction of the human form, not only iconographically but also in terms of techniques, materials, styles, and, quite proba- bly, function. These all militate against any simple com- parison of symbolic meanings and ascribed gender roles and status. Tempting though it may be to read the ori- gins of patriarchy into the Bronze Age, this will require a far more developed body of theory and a more compre- hensive understanding of the entire range of material and its social and depositional context.</page><page sequence="2">Volume 38, Number i, February 1997 1 85 Reply DIANE L. BOLGER University of Maryland, European Division, Gruenebergweg 8i, 60322 Frankfurt, Germany. I5 VII 96 The main objective of my report was the engendering of Cypriot anthropomorphic figurines by viewing them in their changing social, political, and economic settings. Concepts such as "male," "female," and "motherhood" are social constructs whose meanings vary through time and across space; therefore, an interpretation of "moth- erhood" from the evidence of the Cypriot plank figu- rines can be arrived at only through an understanding of the cultural framework in which they were made and used. Although it is true that motherhood per se cannot be equated with low female status, I have argued that in the context of the prestate cultures of the Cypriot Bronze Age mother figurines communicated powerful social messages concerning the restriction and control of female sexuality. In societies lacking class structures or centralized political institutions, autonomous local groups provide the settings for economic production and exchange and for control over land and resources. Prior to the emergence of the state, such control is normally exercised by kinship structures which seek to restrict access to economic resources through the construction and enforcement of cultural rules concerning marriage, fertility, and paternity. As Frankel says, more settlement evidence is needed from the Early and Middle Bronze Ages to explore these questions fully. However, the evidence already at hand (including some settlement evidence, a rich variety of coroplastic art depicting scenes from everyday life, and extensive evidence from the large funerary complexes along the north coast) strongly suggests higher levels of social organization and hierarchy at that time. While Early and Middle Bronze Age settlements were indeed "communally based," their surplus economies (involv- ing intensified agriculture, the use of the plow and trac- tion animals, and increasing complexity in the labor force as the result of the secondary-products revolution and accelerated levels of metallurgical production in- cluding the first weapons) rendered them far less egali- tarian than the simple agricultural communities of the Chalcolithic period. A growing number of Cypriot ar- chaeologists now accept the concept of "levels of com- plexity" prior to the rise of state society during the Late Bronze Age, and indeed a full appreciation of the ways in which the latter developed demands that we transcend simplistic binary categories such as egalitarian/complex or communal/state. I shall be exploring these and re- lated questions in greater detail in a forthcoming book on gender and society in prehistoric Cyprus. Regarding my use and interpretation of the figurines themselves, Frankel misconstrues several key points. The fact that only a small percentage of the Cypriot plank figurines show women holding infants is irrele- vant. The point here is that postpartum motherhood is the only aspect of fertility displayed on the plank figu- rines, and that aspect of fertility had not been a focal point of the birthing figurines of the Chalcolithic period. The latter depict various stages of pregnancy and partu- rition and with regard to female roles in childbearing are thus less uniform and standardized than their Bronze Age successors. The only real exception, and the one which Frankel has taken note of, is not a figurine but a scenic composition on a bowl from Marki now in the Pierides Museum, Larnaca. This example supports rather than contradicts my thesis, however, since the life-cycle stages of the female depicted here (marriage, pregnancy, birth, motherhood) culminate in mother- hood. The engendered subtext of this scene is the social trajectory a woman was expected to follow in order to be regarded as a full-fledged member of society. This "cultural blueprint" is striking and suggests a dynamic/ didactic rather than merely a static/reflective function for this vessel, a kind of "media image" whose purpose may have been to counter and control the perceived dan- gers of unguarded female fertility. Such ideological so- cial messages are entirely absent among the female fig- urines of the Chalcolithic period. It is unfortunate that contextual evidence is lacking for much of the Early and Middle Bronze Age coroplastic material, but I disagree with Frankel that it would add little to the discussion. In the first place, there is more to context than provenance or general context types (i.e., funerary vs. settlement). The entire discussion of gender roles in the Bronze Age, in fact, would be deeply en- riched if we had access to specific contextual associa- tions. With whom were these objects associated? With what other kinds of objects or nonartifactual material did they occur? And what percentages of burials or buildings contained them? In other words, did the acqui- sition and use of figurines involve ritual behaviors en- gaged in by particular kin, gender, or age groups, or did all members of society have the right to use them? The answers to these and similar questions would contribute greatly to our understanding of the social context of rit- ual as well as to a discussion of gender constructs during the Cypriot Bronze Age. To that end, it is hoped that excavations such as those currently being undertaken by Frankel and Webb at Marki-Alonia might furnish spe- cific details of the uses of figurines in nonfunerary con- texts. Such evidence would serve at the very least as important comparative material for the nonfunerary rit- ual deposit from Kissonerga whose contextual evidence, albeit unique for Chalcolithic Cyprus, has contributed so much to our understanding of ritual behavior in the centuries before the Bronze Age.
