<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sutra of Maggots and Blowflies S allie Tisdale The great entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre covered his desk with the carcasses of birds and snakes, opened the window, and waited. He didn't have to wait long. From the time I was quite young, I loved cold-blooded creatures. I had to be taught not to pick things up in the woods: To me it was all good, all worth examination, from beetles to mushrooms to toads. I was stealthy, and in the thistle-ridden fields near my house, I caught many blue-belly lizards to keep as pets. My father built a cage for them, a wonderful wood-and-screen contraption that smelled of pine and grass and reptile. I kept garter snakes and frogs and chameleons too. Once, someone gave me a baby alligator. I had several praying mantises, and built them elaborate branch houses in the cage, and fed them crickets. I don't know where this came from, my appetite for the alien,- it feels like an old question, long and mysterious. My study of living things, part inquiry and part the urge to possess, became inevitably a study of prédation and decay. I had to feed my pets, and most preferred live food. The mantises always died, their seasons short. The chameleons died, too delicate for my care. The alligator died. I tried to embalm it, with limited success—just good enough for an excellent presentation at show-and-tell. When one of my turtles died, my brother and I buried it in my mother's rose bed to see if we could get an empty turtle shell, which would be quite a good thing to have. When we dug it up a few weeks later, there was almost nothing left—an outcome I had not anticipated, and one that left me with a strange, disturbed feeling. The earth was more fierce than I had guessed. In time I became specifically interested in human bodies, how they worked and how they got sick and what they looked like when they died. This did not pacify my mother, who worried aloud about my ghoulish preoccupations. I did enjoy the distress I could cause by something as simple as bringing an embalmed baby alligator to</page><page sequence="2">Sallie Tisdale school in a jar. But I was also—and for a long time I could not have explained why it was of a piece with my impassioned studies—ex quisitely sensitive to the world's harsh rules. I regretted each cricket. An animal dead by the side of the road could bring me to tears, and I cried for each dead lizard, each mantis. A triad, each leg bearing weight: sensitivity, love, and logic. The weight on each leg shifts over time: now, a penetrating awareness of the cruelty seemingly built into the world's bones. Now, a colder logic, an awareness of the forces that balance systems at the cost of individuals. At times in brief pure blinks of my mind's eye, a love painful in its intensity, an un alloyed love. I love the tender, pale blossoms opening now on the cherry tree in my yard, the sudden pound of lush raindrops from the empty sky: Each thing I see is a luminous form in a sparkling world. Such love is a kind of grace; enshrined in it, all is right with the world. It is a little touch of madness, this kind of love—raw and driving. Some years ago, I began to study the small things in the forest that I didn't understand, moving from the lovely and lethal amanita mushrooms to the stony, invincible lichens to the water skippers coasting lightly across the little creeks. I began to study insects espe cially and then flies in particular. Flies are so present and innumerable that it is hard to see their presence clearly, hard to believe in their measure. There are around 120,000 species of flies, depending on who's counting, and they have many names: bee flies, cactus flies, papaya flies, warble flies, brine flies, nimble flies, biting midges, green midges, gall midges, moun tain midges, dixid midges, solitary midges, net-winged midges, phan tom midges—so called because the larvae are transparent and seem to disappear in water. Studying flies, my head begins to spin with suborders and divisions, tribes and clades, and the wild implications of the Latin names: Psychodidae and Sarcophagidae and Calliphora vomitoria. The Order Diptera is old, as are most insects; it was well estab lished by the Jurassic Era, 210 million years ago.1 (Unlike all other insects, flies do not have four wings. Diptera comes from the word di for two and ptera for wings.) Fly biology is a vast and changing 'We are one kingdom with flies: Animali, and then we diverge. (You can remember the taxonomic series of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genera, species with an appropriate mnemonic: Keep Pots Clean; Oui Food Gets Spoiled. ) Flies are found in the Phylum Arthropoda: exoskeletons, jointed legs, and segmented bodies, a group that includes crabs, centipedes, and spiders as well. The flies are in the Subphylum</page><page sequence="3">Sallie Tisdale field. New species and subspecies of flies are always being discov ered. Familiar species are found in new locations; variants between species are analyzed in new or more subtle ways, and so the taxo nomic distinctions between flies are always being revised. But in the general term, flies are defined by their single set of wings, legless larvae, and mouthparts designed for biting, sucking, or lapping. Inside these templates, there is stupefying variation. They are di vided into families, genera, and species by the varied location of veins in the wings, their color, body size, type of mouthpart, the number of stages of larval development, the type and separation of eyes, antennal structure, the arrangement and number of bristles on the body, the length of the legs, and habitat—differences controversial and infinitesimally detailed. We often know them as the most common and familiar things, as single things: individual flies rescued or swatted, struggling in webs, crawling dizzily across cold windowpanes on a milky October day. One finds flies in odd places, but so often they are not a surprise even in surprising locations—in the laundry basket or buzzing inside the medicine cabinet, or caught unaware in the wash water. Almost every fly you catch in your house will be a housefly, one of the fam ily Muscidae, chubby and vigilant flies that can birth a dozen gener ations every summer. (Houseflies are found in virtually every place on earth save for Antarctica and a few isolated islets.) Sometimes we know them as plagues: I've been battered by biting flies in forests, near mangrove and in sand, flies the size of pinheads in clouds so thick I couldn't walk twenty feet without getting a crop of angry red bites on every inch of exposed skin. These are the ones we call punkies or gnats or no-see-ums, the fly family known as Ceratopogonidae. There are more than four thousand species of them—tiny, almost invisible flies with stinging bites, inexplicable dots of pain. The Encyclopaedia Britannica says simply, "It is not possible to discuss all dipteran habitats." Flies live in the air and the soil and under water and inside the stems and leaves of plants. They live high in the mountains, in sand and snow, tide pools and lakes, sulfur springs and salt lagoons. The brine fly lives in the thermal springs of Yellowstone at temperatures up to 43 degrees Celsius. There are Mandibulata, which means mandibles on the second segment past the mouth open ing, and just imagine that. We are not in Kansas anymore. Class Insecta means a body is divided into head, abdomen, and thorax. The insects from here on out—beetles, fleas, ants, scorpions, walking sticks, and many other types—are entirely separate orders. 10</page><page sequence="4">Sallie Tisdale flies in the volcanic hot springs of Iceland and New Zealand living at even higher temperatures. Certain flies handle extreme cold easily too, blessed with a kind of antifreeze and other strange gifts. The wingless snow fly lives underground in burrows, and wanders across the white fields during the day—wee black spots walking briskly along in the afternoon. The Himalayan glacier midge prefers tem peratures around the freezing point, but has been seen active at minus 16 degrees Celsius. (When placed in a hand, it becomes agi tated and then faints from heat.) One carnivorous fly lays its eggs in pools of seeping petroleum, where the larvae live until maturity. One wingless fly lives inside spiders. Certain flies can live in vinegar. There are flies munching contently on spoiled vegetables. When we eat them by accident, they just ride the peristaltic wave on through, exiting in our feces and moving along. The single pair of wings that is crucial to the identity of flies may be very small or startlingly large or vestigial, may lie open or closed, look scaly, milky, beribboned with black veins, smoky or transpar ent. Instead of a second set of wings, flies have small bony structures called halteres. They are mobile gyroscopes for flight, beating in time but out of sync with the wings, twisting with every change of direc tion, to keep the fly from tumbling. Most are astonishing flyers, able to move in three dimensions at speeds hard to measure. Some can hover motionless and fly backward or forward or sideways like helicopters. (Flower flies, which look alarmingly like wasps but are harmless, will hover in front of your face, appearing to gaze directly into your eyes.) Midges beat their wings more than a thousand times per second; this is too fast for nerve impulses and instead involves a mysterious muscular trigger effect. A fruit fly can stay aloft for an entire afternoon, burning ten percent of its body weight every hour. There are clumsy flies: The march fly travels laboriously only a few feet off the ground, and so is continuous fodder for car radiators, march flies are often seen banging into people and bushes, and even the walls of buildings. Soldier flies can fly, but don't very often; they sit for long periods of time on leaves or flowers. Other species prefer to walk or run, sometimes on the surface of water,- the louse fly, often wingless, walks sideways, like a crab. John Clare wrote of flies that "they look like things of mind or fairies." There are flies so small they can barely be seen by human eyes; others are as wide and long as a man's hand. Their bodies may be lime green or shiny blue, glowing black, metallic or dull yellow, pearly white, leathery, variegated in browns, matted with dust. A 11</page><page sequence="5">Sallie Tisdale few are flecked with iridescent gold and silver. They are squat or slender or wasp waisted. Their legs may be very long and fine or stubby, delicate as a web or stout and strong. Fly genitalia, one text notes, are "extremely polymorphous." Some flies have beards or even furry coats made of bristles; others seem hairless. The hover flies mimic bees and wasps, growing yellow-brown bristly hair like the fur of a bumblebee or striped like yellow jackets. The tangle-veined fly, which is parasitic on grasshoppers, has a loud, bee-like buzz. A fly's antennae may be akin to knobs or threads or whips or feathers or pencilline brushes. Insects do not breathe exactly,- they perform gas exchange in a different way from mammals, through tubes called spiracles. Their larvae breathe in many ways, through gills and snorkels, or by taking up the oxygen stored in plant roots and stems. Spiracles show up just about anywhere: beside the head, in the belly, in a maggot's anus. What great variety they have! When Augustine argued that the fly is also made by God, he spoke of "such towering magnitude in this tininess." The family Nycteribiidae, the bat ticks, are true flies but look like spiders without heads. They live only in the fur of bats, sucking bat blood, hanging on with claws. Exposed, the stunted bugs run rapidly across the bat's fur before disappearing underneath. But the family Tipulidae, the crane flies, fill your palm. They look like giant tapered mosquitoes, with very long, slender, spiderlike legs, three eyes, and big veiny wings that may span three inches. They do not bite. These are the ballerinas of the flies, delicate and graceful. Male crane flies form mating swarms that dance above treetops at sundown, or flow over pastures in a cloud, pushed by the breeze. So one fly seeks light and heat; another avoids both. One is a veg etarian—another a terror. They flit like tiny shadows in the night skies, crawl across the windowpane and out of the drain and into the garbage and into our eyes. Sometimes flies migrate out to sea far from anything human, flitting across the white-capped waves of the ever-moving sea for miles, for days. The fly is grotesque and frail and lovely and vigorous, quivering, shivering, lapping, flitting, jerking, sucking, panting: Theirs is an exotic genius, a design of brilliant sim plicity and bewildering complexity at once. I study flies; I am stunned by them. I love them, with a fleeting love—with the triad: love, logic, sensitivity. Did you notice how calmly I noted that there is a fly that lives inside spiders? Another that is parasitic on grasshoppers? This is a humming, buzzing world; we live in the midst of the ceaseless murmur of lives, a world of 12</page><page sequence="6">S allie Tisdale Strange things whispering the poems of old Buddhas. The world's constant rustling is like the rubbing of velvet between distracted fingers; it can drive one mad. Beside the cherry tree, under that bright sky, lives the sheep bot fly. It enters a sheep's nostrils, where it gives birth to live young. The maggots crawl up the nasal passages into the sinuses, where they feed until they are grown—a process that lasts nearly a year. The sheep's nose runs with pus; it shakes its head at this odd itch, shakes and rubs its nose into the ground, grits its teeth, jumps about, growing ever weaker. The condition is sometimes called the blind staggers. One day the sheep gives a great sneeze, and out shoot mature sheep bot flies. They are ready to mate and make more babies. It is right here with flies that I face a direct and potent challenge: What do I really believe? What do I believe about beauty and the ulti mate goodness of this world? Jean-Henri Fahre lays out his corpses by the open window. A few days later, he writes, "Let us overcome our repugnance and give a glance inside." Then he lifts the bodies, counting the flies that have come, the eggs they lay, the larvae that form "... a surging mass of swarming sterns and pointed heads, which emerge, wriggle, and dive in again. It suggests a seething billow." He adds, as an aside, "It turns one's stomach." He examines and measures and counts, and then gently places a few hundred eggs in a test tube with a piece of meat squeezed dry. A few days later, he pours off the liquescent remnants of the once-hard flesh, which "flows in every direction like an icicle placed before the fire." He measures it, and keeps careful notes. "It is horrible," he adds, "most horrible." I have been a Buddhist for more than twenty-five years, since I was a young woman. My avid urge to understand bodies didn't stop at the bodies themselves,-1 sought for a way to think about the fact of life, the deepest query. Buddhism in its heart is an answer to our ques tions about suffering and loss, a response to the inexplicable,- it is a way to live with life. Its explanations, its particular vocabulary and shorthand, its gentle pressures—they have been with me throughout my adult life; they are part of my language, my thought, my view. Buddhism saved my life and controlled it,- it has been liberation and censure at once. Buddhism is blunt about suffering, its causes and its cures. The Buddha taught that nothing is permanent. He taught this in a great many ways, but most of what he said came down to this: Things change. Change hurts; change cannot be avoided. "All compounded 13</page><page sequence="7">Sallie Tisdale things are subject to dissolution"—this formula is basic Buddhist doctrine, it is pounded into us by the canon, by the masters, by our daily lives. It means all things are compounded and will dissolve, which means I am compounded and I will dissolve. This is not something I readily accept, and yet I am continually bombarded with the evidence. I longed to know this, this fact of life, this answer— that we are put together from other things and will be taken apart and those other things and those things we become will in turn be taken apart and built anew—that there is nothing known that escapes this fate. When one of his disciples struggled with lust or felt pride in his youth or strength, the Buddha recommended that the follower go to the charnel ground, and meditate on a corpse—on its blossoming into something new. We feel pain because things change. We feel joy for the same rea son. But suffering is not simply pain: It is our peculiar punishment that we know things change and we want this to be otherwise. We want to hang on to what is going away, keep our conditions as they are, people as they are, ourselves as we are. In Buddhist terms this is variously called thirst or desire or attachment or clinging. It means that we hold on to the hope that something will remain, even as it all slides away like sand in running water, like water from our hands. Knowing the answer does not stop the question from being asked. Desire is not always about holding something close; it has a shad ow, the urge to push things away. Buddhists usually call this aver sion—the desire for the extinction of something, for separation from it. The original Pâli word for aversion, dosa, is various and shaded, translated sometimes as anger or hatred, sometimes as denial, as pro jection, aggression, repulsion, and now and then as disgust or revul sion or distortion. Aversion has as much force and fascination as the positive desires we know. It may be simply a reflexive flinch, a duck ing for cover,- it may be much stronger. Like desire, aversion is a many-colored thing, flavored by circumstances. It is a kind of cling ing—clinging to the hope of something other than this. When I began to study flies, I couldn't seem to stop. Fahre wrote, "To know their habits long haunted my mind." I think of the vio lence with which we describe such prurient obsessions—we say we cannot tear our eyes away. My eyes are glued to flies and it is as though they are stitched open against my will. I feel revulsion, I flinch, I turn away, I duck for cover. I get squeamish, which is a rare feeling for me. But I also feel curiosity and admiration and a kind of awe. The buzz of a fly's blurred wings is one of the myriad ways 14</page><page sequence="8">Sallie Tisdale the world speaks to us; it is one of the ways speech is freed from our ideas. I feel that if I could listen, if I could just listen without reacting, without judgment or preference or opinion—without reach ing for a dream of how things might be otherwise—there is some thing I would understand that I have yet to know. Compassion in all its flavors is woven through the enormous canon of Buddhist thought. Its root meaning is "to suffer with." We are able to feel compassion toward those beings who look like us and those who are most familiar. (These are not the same thing; dissim ilar creatures can be deeply familiar, as we know from our time spent with dogs, with horses—even lizards.) At what point do we extend this circle past what is known, past what looks like us? At what point do we suffer with what is completely strange? And how far must that circle extend before it includes the sheep bot fly? This mix of push and pull I feel when I look at insects is akin to the way the tongue longs for an acquired taste. The first time one tastes certain complex flavors they are unpleasant, even offensive. But in time it is that very flavor, its complexity—the bitterness or acidity mingling with other layers—that brings you back. Whether it is wine or chili powder or natto—a Japanese delicacy of soybeans bound into a sticky, cobwebbed mold—one returns in part because of the difficulty. We are sharply, pleasantly excited by the nearness of rejection, by skirting along the edge of things, the dank and sour things that instinct reads as dangerous. These shadings of flavor ever so briefly evoke poison and rot—the urine scent of beer, the linger ing oily bitterness of coffee, the rank tang of certain cheeses (and I will return to cheese; it factors here). There is a brief shrinking away, perhaps very brief, minuscule, but there nonetheless. This is a little bit of what I feel toward flies. Let us give a glance inside—a glance, a gasp, a shiver, the briefest reactivity: and then another look, a bit sideways though it may be, and then another. Then there follows the need to look: interest turning into inquiry into passion: the desire to know, to see, and something more, some thing crucial—the need to bear it, to be able to bear it, to be able to look as closely and thoroughly as I can. Flies have long been considered the shells and familiars of gods, witches, and demons. They are associated with reincarnation, im mortality, and sorcery. They are so unutterably strange, all swarming and speed and single-mindedness, and they cannot be avoided. I really 15</page><page sequence="9">Sallie Tisdale mean that; we eat flies every day.2 The FDA permits thirty-five fruit fly eggs in every eight ounces of golden raisins, up to twenty maggots "of any size" in a hundred grams of canned mushrooms, and a fair number of both eggs and maggots in tomato products. Last night's mushroom pizza? A womb of flies. Flies sense the world in every way, its faintest textures: minuscule currents of shifting air, the vibration of a bird's approaching wings, the scent of decaying flowers or a mouse's corpse a half mile away. Some flies have a complex and unique ear, a flexible tympanal mem brane in a complex structure behind the neck. A few parasitic flies listen for the distinct sound of their selected prey; one imagines a head carefully cocked. They taste and smell in ways far more subtle than ours. There is no profound difference between the two senses anyway; both are a way of identifying chemicals, defining them, discriminating. They sense the sex pheromones released so hopefully by their prey, and follow,- they smell the prey's feces, its breath, or the small damage done by other hunting insects. Biting flies are sensitive to stress chemicals, including the higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted when mammals exert themselves. The black flies respond directly to the scent of human sweat. Many flies have taste and smell receptors on their complex mouthparts, their antennae, the delicate legs, and fine-clawed feet. Walking, they sample the coming meal; instantly, the proboscis unwinds. Flies are sensitive to minute differences in the world's chemistry, and its surprising similarities: One of the par asitic Lucilia flies is attracted, according to one text, to "wild pars nips and fresh meat." One molecule attracts the male to the female, another causes the male's ritual courtship flight; a third causes the female to relax and hold still. Their world is a superdimensional 2Consider the cheese skipper, a kind of black fly found all over the world. They are so called in part because they skip, or leap, when disturbed; they curl up, grabbing the tail with the hooked mouth, tense, and then let go—springing like a coil, fast and hard. Cheese skippers are attracted to meat, cheese, and corpses, which develop a cheesy smell at a certain stage when butyric acid is present. Their family name, Piophilia, means milk loving. The larvae can be eaten accidentally, and may survive ingestion and burrow into the gut. One imagines the little thing shrugging its nonexistent shoulders and changing course. When the larvae infest a hard cheese like pecorino, they decompose the fats until the cheese turns creamy and pink, at which point the Italians call it casu marzu, "rotten cheese." Gourmets like it, and will blend casu maizu into a paste to spread on bread. Most people try to remove the maggots first. Selling this cheese is illegal in Italy, because even shredded maggot parts are danger ous—all those hooks. But not everyone does this. Some consider the maggots part of the delicacy—an aphrodisiac, or a peculiarly nutritious food. 16</page><page sequence="10">Sallie Tisdale pheromonal architecture, a mingled and vaporous mist multiplied by sight and sound and space. Consider the compound eye, common to all insects, variously evolved in flies. A fly's eyes may be huge: the eyes of horse flies are bulging black caps filling the face. Other flies may have tiny eyes, and some flies have no eyes at all. (The pyrgotid flies have strangely shaped heads that protrude in front of their eyes, an evolutionary development hard to comprehend.) The eye may be flat or bulging, round or triangular in shape, shining like jewels. A deer fly's eyes are brightly colored, green or gold with patterns and zigzags. Tachinid flies have reddish eyes; dance flies have orange ones. Each facet of a compound eye is held at a unique angle, independent of all the others. They are capable of differentiating between the wavelengths of light and can distinguish the angle at which sunlight falls, allow ing them to navigate off the surface of water. A fly has a thousand eyes, four thousand eyes, side by side without gap. The fly cannot focus on a single form, but sees each form from many angles at once. Each single thing is multiplied, the object broken like a mirror into shards, into shocks of light, and remade like water into a single lake, a prism, a drop of dew. Flies eat blood and meat and feces and other insects and each other, but also pollen, nectar, algae, decaying seaweed, and fungi. Bulb fly maggots are tiny dilettantes, seeking only the inner tissue of hya cinth, tulip, narcissus, and lily bulbs. Fruit fly maggots are picky: One species eats walnut husks, another eats cherries. Pomace flies live on rotting fruit, but they don't eat the fruit; they eat the yeast that grows on rotting fruit. (This is a brief world indeed; a new gen eration is born every ten days or so.) Flies bite, suck, slice, lap. Bee lice live in the mouths of bees, eat ing nectar. Stiletto fly larvae sometimes live in wool blankets and decaying wood. Among the black flies, which plague cattle, each species specializes in a cow part—one sucks blood from cows' bel lies, one from cows' ears, and so on. The flat-footed flies, which run in a zigzag pattern across plants, include a variety called smoke flies; they are attracted to fires and eat the burned wood afterward. Eye gnats are drawn to tears, sweat flies to sweat, face flies to eyes and noses. Flies hurt us, but only in passing; sleeping sickness, malaria, yel low fever, river blindness: mere accidents. The sheep bot fly can live in many places, including human eyes if eyes are more convenient than the sheep—but it prefers the sheep. We are simply more food, 17</page><page sequence="11">Sallie Tisdale more warm and meaty beings among endless beings. But what food!—palaces of muscle and blood, rich and fertile fields. I read otherwise sober and mechanical descriptions of flies, and trip over the anthropomorphic complaint. Both Pliny and Plutarch complained that flies were impossible to train and domesticate. Among modern thinkers, one fly is "good" and the other is "bad," one is a "pest" and another a "bane" and another a "benefit." The tachinid flies are parasitic on destructive caterpillars, and snipe flies eat aphids, so they are described with kind words. Their prédation does us good, but all prédation does something good and not just the predator. Prédation makes way. It makes room. Even entomologists hate flies, on principle. Edwin Way Teale, who wrote of the natural world his entire life with reverence and cheer, hated the housefly. He obsessed over the number and variety of bac teria, fungi, viruses, and parasites they carried from place to place, and finally seems to have simply flung his hands into the air and given up, declaring the housefly "an insect villain with hardly a drop of redeeming virtue." Leland Howard, a USDA entomologist, wrote an encyclopedic account of insects in 1904 that is still quoted today. He called the harmless saltwater flies "sordid little flies," and the wingless bird tick "apparently too lazy to fly." Of the bluebottle, which sometimes has parasitic mites, he wrote, "It is comforting to think that the house-fly has these parasites which torment him so. Such retribution is just." Humans are a nightmare,- we tear the earth apart. We trepan moun tains and pour them into rivers, take the soil apart down to its atoms, sully the sea, shred our world like giant pigs rutting after truffles. We poison our nest and each other and ourselves. We eat everything, simply everything, but we turn away from flies. The circles of compassion can suddenly expand. Federico Garcia Lorca wrote that he rescued flies caught at a window; they reminded him of "people / in chains." And of course I've done the same. I often do—catch flies and crickets and spiders and let them go, careful of their frailty. This brief moment of the widening circle; it is easily challenged by the maggot, by the swarm. The larvae of the fungus gnat sometimes travel in great masses, for reasons no one can guess—huge groups called worm snakes piled several deep, squirm ing along about an inch a minute. I know why Beelzebub is Lord of the Flies; is there any other god who would slouch so towards Bethlehem? I long sometimes for a compound eye. It is a tenet of my religious 18</page><page sequence="12">Sallie Tisdale practice, an ever-present thorn, to remember that my point of view, that any point of view, is merely a point. My eyes cannot see a landscape, let alone a world. But how we judge things has everything to do with where we stand. Can I learn to see a form from many angles at once? Can I see other beings, this moment, my mistakes, my words, like this? Can I know multiplicity as a single thing? So many flies: Mydas flies, sewage flies, robust bot flies, gout flies, scavenger flies, snipe flies. Big-headed flies, thick-headed flies, pic ture-winged flies, stilt-legged flies, spear-winged flies, banana-stalk flies, flower-loving flies, stalk-eyed flies, flat-footed flies, pointed winged flies, hump-backed flies. The literature of Zen Buddhism is thick with nature—nature images, metaphors, puzzles, and questions, but mostly the calm and serene inhuman world of clouds, seeds, spring shoots, meadow grasses, and ponds, the moon and the mountain and the wave and the plum blos som. (Kobayashi Issa, an eighteenth-century Buddhist haiku master, wrote: "Where there are humans / there are flies / and Buddhas." But he is talking, I think, rather more about humans than flies.) Such images are used as metaphors for all kinds of Buddhist concepts, but they are partly an effort to convey how Zen Buddhism describes reality itself, the world. Hongzhi, a great Zen master of China, de scribed it as "sky and water merging in autumn"—a vast, shifting, unbounded world. Central to Zen Buddhism is a belief in busshö, usually translated from the Japanese as Buddha Nature. (In English we like to capital ize words like buddha and nature, to distinguish subtly different ideas with the same sound. Today, glancing inside the seething bil low of life, it seems to me an impotent fist shaking at the greatness of what we try to say with the words. But I will follow the rule.) Busshö is shorthand for something that requires quite a few words to explain—or it is already one too many words for what can't be explained in words. Buddhism is founded on the idea that all things are impermanent, that nothing has a fixed self-nature that passes through time unchanged. Change is not an aspect of the matrix but the matrix itself. It is because no one thing is permanent that we are not separated from anything—not bounded, not contained. All beings are constantly appearing, constantly springing into existence, hurtling out of themselves, of what they were, what preceded. Buddha Nature is—what? Original nature. Perfect nature—the substrate or 19</page><page sequence="13">S allie Tisdale source of all things. But it is not God, it is not ether, it is not simply a womb that gives birth. It is all things; it is that which manifests as things—as the world—as people, rocks, stars, dewdrops, flies—all beings, all forms, all existent things. All existence. What do I know about Buddha Nature, anyway? I can't even tell you what it is—and Buddha Nature isn't an "it" and it isn't really an "is" either,- not a quality attached to anything or a state of being or a space in which things exist; Buddha Nature as I understand it— there's that "it" again—is this, this, this, here, this minuscule and gargantuan and muscular relational and organic now, the luminosity of the sparkling world, the vast inevitability of loss, and not that exactly either. I use that phrase, Buddha Nature, even as it fills my mouth with ash, to mean all those things and more—relation, as pects, moments, qualities, acts, aeons, and bodies—and I use it in a positive way, with pleasure, with outright joy, to mean that all of us—those of us who think we are something unique and those who never think about it, and all those creatures who don't do what I might call thinking but are yet alive, and all those things we bang up against and assume aren't alive at all—are in some way kin, in some way both source and effect, eternally and continually and without hesitation, spontaneously and instantaneously and infinitely giving birth to ourselves, spilling out of nothing into nothing, with great vigor—leaping, sliding, appearing, disappearing into and out of a lack of solidness, into and out of the nonexistence of permanent nature, and that because this is the law—the muscle, the hinge—of reality— it's good. It's all right. Everything is all right. Everything is all right. The female horsefly favors large warm blooded animals. They see quite well and will fly around their prey just out of reach, finally biting one's back or leg. (As is true with many other biting flies, including mosquitoes, only the females bite. The males live on plant pollen and juices. It so happens as well that the males live brief lives while the females live the whole long, hot summer. The story is told that the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4 because the horseflies in Philadelphia were intoler able that year, and the delegates called for an early vote so they could get out of town.) The "phlebotomus" insects, as they are called, have anticoagulant in their saliva,- after a bite, the blood continues to run, sometimes dangerously so. (To be precise, the horsefly slices rather than bites; its mouthparts are like tiny knives.) In their turn, horse flies are eaten by robber flies, who capture them on the wing and then find a convenient twig to rest on while sucking them dry. 20</page><page sequence="14">Sallie Tisdale Robber flies are sometimes called bee killers; they prize honeybees and will watch them from the shadows while the bees gather pollen, then suddenly dart out and seize one from behind, so it can't sting. They drain the bee dry and drop its empty shell; below a familiar perch, the bodies slowly pile up. The cluster fly lays its children inside earthworms. If you crush a cluster fly, it smells like honey. The female thick-headed fly hangs around flowers, drinking nec tar, like a bully at a bar. She waits for a bee or wasp and when one comes close, she grabs it. The bee seems not to care, does not resist, while she deposits an egg before letting go. The bee flies away, the larva hatches, and burrows within. The larva eats the bee slowly until it dies, then falls to the ground within the bee's body and bur rows underground to pupate. Flies are holometabolous, meaning the young undergoes a complete metamorphism into the adult form, into a completely different form. The pupa is the quiescent phase between, and may last days or weeks or even longer. The pupae of flies are not protected by cocoons like those of butterflies; they sim ply harden, or build a shell from soil or spit. Some flies make a pupar ium from their own skin. Eat the bee, crawl underground, sleep the winter through, and emerge as a fly, seeking bees. That is the cycle, the great web of its life, round and round. Pyrgotid flies do the same thing to May beetles, except that instead of burrowing into the ground, they live in the empty beetle shell over the winter. Flesh flies live under the skin of a turtle and in the stom ach of frogs. The sheep bot fly—I have described this creature al ready. But there is also a bot fly that infests rabbits, and a bot fly that lives in horses' throats, a bot fly that favors horses' noses, and an other bot fly that prefers horses' tongues. There are bot flies specific to kangaroos, camels, warthogs, zebras, and elephants. The human bot fly, transmitted by mosquitoes, is cosmopolitan in its tastes; besides people, it infects dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, cattle, and sheep. One of the drawbacks of a long Buddhist practice is that one some times has the urge to present one's self as more composed than one actually is. (Let's be clear here; I mean me.) Emotional equanimity is a Buddhist virtue, a reflection of one's ability to accept reality and a sign that one is not contributing to the heat of suffering in the world by resisting that reality. That this equanimity is a real thing to me, a true tranquillity found through steady practice, is beside the point. My tranquillity may be real but it is not immune to conditions; it is no more permanent or unchanging than my skin. At times there is a 21</page><page sequence="15">Sallie Tisdale loud voice inside me, complaining indignantly: Explain this! Someone please explain this. In my dreams, I could not make Apocephalus peigandei. It is named after Theodore Pergande, a renowned entomologist of the lat ter nineteenth century who was particularly interested in aphids and ants. He was observing carpenter ants one day when he saw the heads of the ants begin to fall off one at a time. When he investigated, he found what has become known colloquially as the ant-decapitat ing fly. The mature fly lays eggs on an ant's neck. The larvae hatch and then bore into the ant's head, eating it from the inside. Eating, the larva grows, slowly killing the ant, which apparently expires just as its head pops off. But as many of us wish we could do, it does not leave its childhood home behind. Instead, the little vermin remains inside for a while, and if you look closely that is what you will see: ants' heads, walking around, filled with the children of flies. A Buddhist practice requires rigorous self-disclosure—mostly to one's own self—and a kind of undefended willingness to be present in one's own crappy life as it is. This means noticing how often we tell lies about ourselves. I lie about many things, to myself and oth ers. I lie about the way that triad on which I balance tilts: sensitiv ity, logic, love. It limps at times, or I find myself one-legged, just plain falling down. I am not always at home in this world, not always relaxed, not always in love with this great big Buddha-Nature-ridden place. The Tachinidae is one of the largest, most selective, and success ful fly families. "Ingenious," says one entomologist, for how they have solved the problems of their peculiar niche—"respiration in particular," since it is tricky to breathe inside things. Tachinid larvae are pure parasites, infesting virtually every kind of insect. One type lays its eggs on the leaves preferred by a certain caterpillar,- the cater pillar eats the eggs, and the larvae hatch inside—born, as it were, at the buffet table. Another chooses crickets and katydids. The female fly can hear the precise frequency of the cricket chirp. (She can also hear, though the calls are many times higher, the ultrasound calls of the insectivorous bats she wants to avoid.) She follows the chirp carefully through a mechanism. When she locates the host, she lays her live babies beside or on them. They burrow in and eat selective ly to keep the host alive as long as possible. Caught in a certain light, tachinid flies glow, their wings like violet veils, ovaline eyes the burnt orange of sunset. I sit in the dark summer night, pleasantly melancholy, listening to crickets and 22</page><page sequence="16">Sallie Tisdale contemplating busshö in a pulsing world. I can pretend to have this settled. I can pretend to not mind. Certain gall midges are parasitic on themselves: The larvae hatch inside the mother and eat her from the inside out. I am appalled, even as I recognize the marvelous efficiency. Then I turn away from my own appalled thoughts. I am practicing acceptance. I bow. I tell myself it is a kind of compassion. It is sacrifice. (As though I under stand that in some way.) The horsefly bites a horse, and the blood runs, and before the wound even closes the face fly creeps in and settles down to stay. The human bot fly captures a bloodsucker, such as a mosquito, and lays eggs on its body—just enough that the mosquito can still move freely. Then the mosquito finds a host and lands. The heat of the host causes the bot fly larvae to hatch; they slide off to the host's skin, down a follicle of hair, and in, another accidental gift. The larvae live just under the skin. They form a breathing hole with their hooks, keeping it open by digging constantly. This is called myiasis, flies developing in living flesh. (Many fly families indulge,- the human bot fly is just one.) The maggots live under the skin until they are about an inch long. One observer of the condition wrote that myiasis causes "intense discomfort or pain," which is not a surprise. But the maggots are never still; he adds that people also complain of "the dis quieting feeling of never being alone." A person with myiasis must be patient; it is damaging to try to remove tiny larvae. One treatment is suffocation: coating the open ings with paraffin or nail polish or turpentine, or lathering on chlo roform dissolved in vegetable oil. One of the most effective methods for removing them is to lay strips of raw bacon across the wound; the larvae come running. Squirming, rather, in their roiling, systaltic wave. Oh, well—parasitism is routine in the insect world. Can we call it cruel, this life governed by instinct? Consider this: Two flies glued down by their wings to a table, for convenience. A drop of paraffin is carefully poured on their backs and then scooped out into a crater. Each fly's thorax is opened into the crater with a tiny scalpel, expos ing the muscle. Saline is dropped into the craters for moisture. The flies are then rotated and joined, back to back, the paraffin gently sealed with a hot needle to form a double fly. This new kind of fly can walk, sort of, each taking a turn riding the other piggyback—or it can be neatly glued to a stick. For convenience. Now the scientist has a wonderful thing, a little monster with which to study many 23</page><page sequence="17">Sallie Tisdale things: metabolism, hunger, dehydration, decay. Explain that. The larva grows, then settles into pupation. After time, after a mountain of time, the maggot disappears, the cask opens, and a fly emerges. It is fully mature; it will grow no more. The larvae of black flies are aquatic; the matured fly secretes a bubble of air and rises in it like an astronaut to its new life in the air, bursting out of the bubble at the surface. One observer said that a sudden hatching of black flies leaves the water "in great numbers with such force and velocity" that it seemed as though they were being "shot out of a gun." In contrast, the net-winged midge makes a submarine, a stiff case that floats to the surface, where it bursts open; the adults rise from their boats as delicate as mist. At first it is a wrinkled and empty fly bag, without color or strength. The new being takes a great gulp of air and expands, incalculably vast and whole, the actualiza tion of fly. So many flies: tabanid flies, green bottle flies, bronze dump flies, stilt-legged flies, bush flies, stable flies, louse flies, frit flies, dung flies, rust flies, elk flies, seaweed flies, rust flies, scavenger flies, gadflies, skipper flies, soldier flies, Hessian flies, Richard flies, light flies, stone flies, sand flies, grass flies, eye gnats, wood gnats. A myriad mosquitoes. There is something so simple and clear about the speech of flies,- if I knew fly words, what would be clarified in my own? I study how flies use the world—how they make something of it that wasn't there before. They liquefy the dead, they slurp up the world, inhal ing the bodies of others. They shoot out of lakes and the ground and out of bodies, joyous, filled with air. If I believe—and today, I think I do—that every being is Buddha Nature, that there is no place Buddhas cannot or will not go, then I must give a glance inside. I don't know what a Buddha is. One fly, its passing hum, this we know—but they mob up, don't they, into masses of flies, into rivers and mountains of life, crawling and skipping and vibrating without rest, working at disintegration and change. Phantom midges form such enormous swarms they have been mistaken for smoke plumes, humming with such force that, in the words of one observer, they sound "like a distant water fall." Many fly swarms are birth explosions; others are orgies. Male 24</page><page sequence="18">Sallie Tisdale dance flies join in huge mating swarms, graceful ellipses that flow up and down across meadows and gardens. They make frothy structures called nuptial balloons to carry on their abdomens for attracting females. Some species put seeds or algae in their balloons; others go straight for dead bugs—the bigger, the better, as far as the female is concerned. (Female dance flies routinely eat during sex—maybe from the nuptial balloon they have accepted as part of the bargain, but often, they eat another fly.) One type of dance fly uses only saliva and air, creating a lather of emptiness; as they dance, the empty bubbles glitter like lights. Long-legged flies do their mating dance in slow motion, their rhythms complex and mysterious,- they wave black and white leg scales back and forth in front of the female like a vaudeville stripper waves her fans. Pomace flies have tufts of dark hair on their legs called sex combs, with which they hold the female still during mat ing. The male penetrates from behind, the female spasmodically jerking in response. Already mated females are unreceptive; they curl their abdomens under, fly away, or kick at males. The impregnated female seeks a nest. A few flies give live birth, and a few incubate their young. The tsetse fly, keds, and bat flies all hatch within their mother and are fed with something akin to a milk gland until they are ready to pupate, at which point they are finally expelled. But most flies lay eggs—a single egg, or hundreds, or thousands. She has a telescoping ovipositor, fine and small, which emerges from her abdomen and gropes its way inside—into the soft spaces, in the dark. Flies lay their eggs in the roots and stems of plants, in fruit, in the algae of a still pond, in shit, in hair and hide, in the bodies of other insects, the stomachs of cows, the dirty hunks of wool around the anus of sheep, in the pus of an infected wound. (The preference of many carnivorous species is the corpse.) Blowflies deposit eggs in the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, vagina, and anus. Female flies are choosy; many have taste buds on the ovipositor to help them pick the best location—each fly to its own place. Insistent and shy, the ovipositor worms its way down: into garbage and wounds, into the rotten flecks of meat on the floor of a slaughter house, into stagnant water, between the membranous layers of a corpse, between fibers of living muscle, on the umbilical cord of newborn fawns—into "any convenient cavity," says the Britan nica—and deposits tiny eggs shimmery and damp, masses of them. She is careful not to crowd them, filling first one newly made womb, and then another and another. A day later, she dies. 25</page><page sequence="19">Sallie Tisdale Horrible. Most horrible. Larvae are the unfinished fly,- they are like letters not yet making a word. Maggots are the simplest of larvae,- they are the ur-fly, the refined essence of the fly, the marvelously simplified fly—its tem plate, a profoundly primitive thing. Many maggots have no head, consisting only of a body and a mouth filled with hooks. They move by wavelets of muscular contraction and relaxation, grasping with the mouth hooks and other hooks along their sides. They can roll and spring and slide. After they hatch, they eat and grow. This process may be slow or fast. The chironomid midge larva in West Africa grows in spurts, dry ing out and reviving through extreme temperature variations and waves of drought and rain. When it is almost completely desiccated, it enters into a condition called cryptobiosis—still alive but with no signs of metabolism. Sprinkled with water, it wakes up, takes a meal, and starts growing again until the next dry spell. Blue bottle flies require an almost totally humid atmosphere—something a corpse can easily provide in most cases—and in good conditions, hatch almost as soon as they are laid. They begin to eat, and never stop. I am being literal: They never stop. (Trashmen call maggots "disco rice" for the way they wiggle through the waste.) If undis turbed, a maggot will eat without ceasing until it is grown. There is a distinct advantage to maggots having anal spiracles; there is no need to stop eating in order to breathe. Aristotle, like many others for most of history, believed that some flies "are not derived from living parentage, but are generated spon taneously ... in decaying mud or dung; others in timber." They sim ply appear all at once from manure and corpses, with no sign of having been born. How else to explain this locomotion, this primor dial fecundity? Maggots can reduce the weight of a human body by fifty percent in a few weeks. In the decomposing of a body, there are several waves of insects, each colonizing in its turn in a strict sequence. The first wave is blowflies and houseflies of certain species; they begin to arrive within minutes of death. Their bodies are beautiful, glasslike in shimmering greens and blues, their eyes a deep, warm red. They glisten, tremble, and the larvae hatch and eat. They are ingenious little maggots. A dead body is in fact alive, a busy place full of activ ity—so much that the body seems to move of its own accord from their motion. The sound of all this movement, all this life, writes one entomologist, is "reminiscent of gently frying fat." 26</page><page sequence="20">Sallie Tisdale In time, other species of blowflies and houseflies arrive. The corpse begins to blacken, soften. (Corpses at this stage are called "wet carrion" by biologists.) The meat on which the maggots feed begins to liquefy and runs like melting butter. This is the fluid Fahre contemplated in quiet shock. "We here witness the transfusion of one animal into another," he wrote. If the maggots fail to move in time, they drown in the broth of the corpse they are eating. By the time these larvae have fallen off into the soil to pupate, a third wave of flies arrives—fruit flies and drone flies and others, flies that prefer the liquids. Toward the end, the cheese skipper appears, drawn to the smell, and carefully cleans the bones of the remnants of tendons and connective tissue. I contemplate my ordinary, imperfect, beloved body. I contemplate the bodies of my beloveds: individual, singular, unique, irreplaceable people, their skin and eyes and mouths and hands. I consider their skin riddled and bristling with that seething billow, I consider the digestion of their eyes and the liquefaction of those hands, my hands, my eyes—the evolution of the person into the thing, into wet carrion and eventually into a puddle, into soil, into earth, and flies. And it will come, whether I tum away or not. We are nothing more than a collection of parts, and each part a col lection of smaller parts, and smaller, the things we love and all we cherish conglomerates of tiny blocks. The blocks are built up; they will be taken apart the same way; we are nothing more. (And yet we are something more,- this is one of the mysteries, I know. I cannot point to it, hold it, name it, except in the limited and awkward ways I have already tried. But there is something more, and it is the total ity of this nothing more.) Flies are wholehearted things, leading wholehearted lives. They understand dissolution, and by understanding I mean they live it. The parts are separated, they become something new. Pouring one's life into compoundedness without resistance, living by means of compoundedness and its subsequent falling apart—this is the wis dom of the creatures of the earth, the ones besides us, the ones who don't fight it. Because the human heart is devoted to compounded things and tries to hold them still, our hearts break. (One more thing to dissolve.) How can we know their lives? How can we understand the spongy proboscis, softly padded, with its small rasping teeth? What better vision of the fullness of birth and the fullness of death than the maggot and the fly? A legless, headless, gill-breathing vermiform, giving way to the complete stillness of the pupa, and 27</page><page sequence="21">Sallie Tisdale emerging as a land-based flyer—each stage utterly unlike the others, with nothing remaining of what was before. In their turn, maggots and flies help us along in our own fullness of birth and death, until what we were is completely changed. Decomposed, recomposed, compounded, dissolved, disappearing, reappearing—a piece from here and a fleck from there, a taste of this karma, a speck of that memory, this carbon atom, that bit of water, a little protein, a pinch of pain: until a new body and a new life are made from pieces of the past. The wee bit they claim, can you begrudge it? Dissolved, our flesh is their water, and they lap us up. "Placed in her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are one and all alike," wrote Fahre. "There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours: equality in the presence of the maggot." What lucky flies smelled the flowery scent of the Buddha's death, and came—flowing through the air like a river in the sky, a river of flies! What lucky maggots were born in his body, in the moist heat of the afternoon while the disciples still mourned! The maggots and blowflies are the words of the old Buddhas, singing of the vast texture of things, a lullaby of birth and death. They came and turned him into juice and soil, the Buddha flowing gloriously like cream into the ground. After a night of more routinely menacing scenes—an insecurely locked door, a strange man in a wig—I woke in the early morning from a brief, vivid dream. There had been a series of burning rooms, and finally a room completely engulfed in flames. I saw several peo ple walking calmly through the room, untouched, smiling. I woke as one turned and looked at me, and said, "I can't tell you how safe I feel in this house." One of the most famous parables of Buddhism is that of the burn ing house. The story is told by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra. A man's children are trapped in a burning house, and won't leave when he calls them. In order to get them out, safe and free, he promises carts full of treasure, great treasure. Finally, tempted, they come out, and are saved. Fire is change, loss, the impossibility of hold ing on; fire is also the burning, ceaseless desire we feel to hold on to that which can't be held. The house is burning, and we stupidly stand there, refusing to leave—until we are tempted by the promise of treasure—the precious jewels of the Dharma, the practice, the Buddha himself. 28</page><page sequence="22">S allie Tisdale Right here, what do I believe? I do believe in perfection, right here—and not just perfection existing in the midst of decay, but decay as a kind of perfection. I believe in beauty, especially in the moments when one least seeks it—not just the dewdrop, the grass, but beauty in the shuffling of papers on the desk in the little cubicle thick with the snuffles of the sweaty man a few inches away. Beauty in the rattle of the bus sliding halfway into the crosswalk right beside you. Beauty in the liquid aswim with maggots. In everything, in any thing. I can believe this, without in any way really understanding. Even after I have my answer, the question is always being asked. When I begin to truly accept myself as a flit, a bubble, a pile of blocks tilting over, my precious me as a passing sigh in the oceanic cosmos of change—when I accept this moment passing completely away into the next without recourse—when I begin to accept that its very fragility and perishing nature is the beauty in life, then I begin to find safety inside a burning house. I don't need to escape if I know how to live inside it. Not needing to escape, I no longer feel tempted, no longer need promises or rewards. I just walk through it, aware of fire. The north woods in summer smell like blackberry jam, and in the pockets of sun the tiny midges dance in the heat-sweetened air. They are drunk with it, galloping round and round as their lives leak quickly away. They are points of light in the light. 29</page></plain_text>
