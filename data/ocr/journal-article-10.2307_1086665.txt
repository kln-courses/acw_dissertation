<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS THE THEOLOGY OF THE EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHERS. BY WERNER JAEGER, being the Gifford Lectures delivered at St. Andrews, 1936. Oxford: Clarendon Press. First edition 1947, second edition 1948. Pp. 259. ($3.50) When Professor Jaeger applies his vast learning to the investigation of any phase of Greek philosophy, it goes without saying that the result must command the most serious attention and respect. Scholars whose special concern is with the pre-Socratic philosophers, as well as a wider public with a general interest in philosophy, will be grateful for this volume of Gifford Lectures on The Theology of the Early Greek Phil- osophers, both for the author's fresh approach to the problems in the main body of the text, and for the discussions of points of detail and of the literature of the subject in the valuable terminal notes which com- prise nearly a third of the book. In a short notice it is obviously im- possible either to do full justice to the merits or to offer adequate criticism of the weaknesses of this closely-knit work of interpretation, which deals with source material both fragmentary and obscure. All that can be done is to indicate its aim and method and to select one or two points for comment by way of illustration. Jaeger has set himself a two-fold task: (1) to elucidate and give due emphasis to the theological aspect of the thought of the pre-Socratics; and (2) to illustrate the mutual influences one on the other of this philosophical theology and of the mythopoeic imagination of the early epic and didactic poets, particularly of the writers of theogonies. The positivistic interpretation of scholars such as Burnet stressed the em- pirical and scientific aspects of early Greek thought, while neglecting or minimizing its theological aspect. Other scholars, such as K. Joiel, have held that all Greek cosmological speculation had its origin in Orphism and mysticism. Avoiding both these extremes, Jaeger sets early Greek theology squarely in its proper context of genuinely philosophical specu- lation. Herein lies the greatest value of his work. Theology, of course, as we are properly warned, is to be understood not in its more restricted and modern, but in its wider and Greek, sense as "rational insight into the nature of reality." This imposes a methodological difficulty which Jaeger recognizes, but which, in the nature of the case, he can hardly surmount. In the early period theology cannot be clearly distinguished from physics or from ontology. Accordingly, when Jaeger indicates his intention of investigating the impact "which the new and revolutionizing ideas which these early Greek thinkers developed about the nature of the universe upon their conception of what they in a new sense called God or the Divine," the statement comes perilously close to being a tautology, since what these thinkers meant by God and the Divine 36</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 37 "in a new sense" is precisely the nature of the universe disclosed by their rational insight. As a classical philologist Jaeger disavows all dogmatic philosophical bias, and confines himself to tracing the history of the problems which constitute natural theology, "on the basis of careful philological analysis." His work exhibits both the excellences and the limitations of this method. The fragments are treated with a sensitiveness to their diction and style, and an awareness of the significance of their literary form, which have been all too rare in previous works on the subject in English. Jaeger draws attention, for example, to the hymnodic style of the fragment of Anaximander and of certain passages of Anaxagoras, and (in a long and important note on rT Oeiov) traces in illuminating fashion Anaximander's influence on the language and thought of later writers through Aristotle to the Hellenistic philosophers. If the epic of Parmenides is credited with a poetic quality which is hard to discover in it, and if its proem is perhaps overweighted with significance, Parmenides' debt to Hesiod is convincingly demonstrated. Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Empedocles appear not as mere names to which certain doctrines are attached, but as vivid personalities with a sense of mission legitimately to be described as prophetic. It is perhaps inevitable that any attempt to deal systematically with the pre-Socrates should incur charges of straining the evidence and of making categorical assertions where only tentative hypotheses are justified. At too many points Jaeger is obnoxious to this criticism. One example must suffice by way of illustration. Reiterating his view expressed in Paideia I (p. 159), Jaeger rejects (p. 35 and note, p. 207) Diels' trans- lation of Anaximander's KarT 7yv To0 xpbovu 7rlnw. The meaning is not, he thinks, "according to the ordering of time" (nach der Zeit Anordnung) but "according to time's decree." rdSL, says Jaeger, means decree, ordi- nance, in the language of the law-courts. The judge r7aLErr 6bK7)v or ~?iLav or O6varov. Since, according to Anaximander, things pay a ri0Ls for their datLKLa, "7TLSHL must have the meaning 'ordinance' and cannot mean 'order'." Solon's expression Yvin %p xpo6vo is adduced in support. Is not 'must' too strong a word here? The interpretation is possible, certainly, but whether or not a relation between the thought and language of Solon and of Anaximander may be taken for granted, the immediate context does not appear to support Jaeger's rendering. The suggestion of volun- tarism and of anthropomorphism in 'decree' does not naturally follow or develop the notion expressed in the earlier words of the fragment (if, indeed they are Anaximander's) of a necessary process or order. ri v t6 7 yveaLsi Eare Lro OcaL, Kai 7rV c/opav is ra7a7a "'yvYOaE KLara r6 Xpiov. When Jaeger uses this interpretation, which to say the least is debatable, as evidence for the view that social and political justice was thought of as based on "an effective norm inherent in reality itself," one may well ask</page><page sequence="3">38 THE PHOENIX whether he has not been led to reverse the historical order of ideas, and whether the "effective norm in reality" was not, on the contrary, a projection of the norms of society into the order of nature. (Jaeger himself has claimed [Paideia 1. 161] that this 'projection' was first made by Anaximander.) And when he goes further to assert that "to Anaxi- mander everything that happens in the natural world is rational through and through," one can only protest the need for a modicum of philosophic caution. In general perhaps, it may be said that Jaeger shows a dispo- sition to find too much of later thought in the pre-Socratics, and hardly makes due allowance for the fact that the terms of their philosophical vocabulary are still fraught with the associations of popular speech, and that we cannot be sure that in their poetical or aphoristic expression they connote what they do at the more conceptual level of Platonic and Aristotelian thought. In this connection doubt may also be expressed whether Jaeger, in developing Aristotle's admission of "philosophizing" in the first "theologians," does not credit Homer and Hesiod with more "philosophizing" than they did or would have wished to do. To see in Hesiod's series of divine procreations "a type of causal thinking un- mistakably rational" is surely to make too much of a rudimentary observation of the facts of life! Similarly Jaeger's interesting treatment of the notion of soul in Homer assumes in the poet a degree of logically coherent and systematic thinking scarcely to be attributed to him. It cannot be said that the book "reads well." Far too often the writing is marred by a looseness and turgidity of expression which excite in the uncharitable the suspicion that the thought itself is at these points lacking in precision. How much of this is to be charged to the translator and how much is in the original German text, this reviewer, not having seen the latter, cannot say. Certainly the style of the translation is often cumbersome, and sometimes tasteless. Whatever defects the translator of such a book finds in his original, he should not permit himself to repro- duce them in such writing as is to be found, for example, at the opening of Chapter IV. It is doubtless true, as F. H. Bradley once remarked, that the English language is a soil rich with the loam of decayed meta- phors. But even in English there are limits to the liberties which may be taken with them. If one presumes too much on the decomposition, the dead may, as in these pages, be startled into grotesque and unwelcome life. But it would be ungrateful as well as unjust to end this review on a derogatory note. Every competent scholar in the field would acknowledge that Jaeger's book is a most valuable, and henceforth indispensable, work of historical and philological research. But it is more than that. If philosophy cannot be divorced from the history of philosophy, the reverse is also true. Unless, in accordance with certain views currently held, the possibility of metaphysics is in principle to be denied, and the</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 39 quest of Greek philosophical theology for "rational insight into the nature of reality" dismissed as an ignis fatuus, Jaeger's historical and philological researches must be considered to have their own importance for philosophy as a notable contribution to our understanding of this insight.
