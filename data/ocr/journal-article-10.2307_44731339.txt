ABSTRACT The measurement of angular rotation has many applications in crash testing, particularly in tracking the motion of crash dummies. There are currently a few devices for determining angular rotation. These include accelerometer arrays, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sensors, potentiometers, and high speed films. However, there are problems associated with all of these methods. Systron Donner has developed a new device called a "Quartz Rate Sensor" or "QRS". The QRS utilizes a piezoelectric chip which produces a DC voltage proportional to the rate of rotation of the sensor about its sensitive axis. Angular displacement can then be determined from a simple integration. Results of preliminary tests performed at The U.S. Department of Transportation's Vehicle Research and Test Center suggest that the QRS' s yield very accurate results. BACKGROUND The need to measure the angular displacement of an ATD has become increasingly vital to injury assessment. Traditional injury assessment techniques tend to rely on translational head acceleration, engineering quantity effectively measurable by translational accelerometers. However, modern injury assessment techniques are based more on angular quantities rather than translational, and the instrumentation required to measure these quantities is not as readily available. A study was conducted by Viano and Arepally (16) to consider the adequacy of injury criteria and tolerance levels specified by FMVSS 208, the standard that measures the safety performance of restraint systems and supplements. They suggested that additional criteria be added to the standard to represent fundamentally important aspects of a vehicle occupant's kinematic response. These additional criteria include: the change in torso angle (used to evaluate injury to the rib cage), rotation and rebound of the chest and Jacqueline Marshall Ford Motor Co. Dennis A. Guenther The Ohio State Univ. pelvis (necessary to study the effects of submarining), and the bending of the neck. Submarining occurs when the pelvis of a belted passenger slides underneath the lap belt, causing the load of the impact to fall across the abdomen instead of the hips. This phenomena, which may result in serious injury, is not accounted for in traditional injury assessment techniques. Both Freeman and Bacon (4) and Viano and Arepally (16) agree that monitoring pelvis angle may provide a means of quantifying submarining. Freeman and Bacon, using a three- dimensional high speed video system to measure occupant motion, performed extensive tests to evaluate how changes in seat belt anchorage and seat adjustments affected whether or not submarining occurred. The measurement of angular displacement is also necessary for predicting neck injury. The widely used Mertz and Patrick neck injury criteria relates neck injury to the bending moment of the head developed about the occipital condyle and the angle of the neck at the first thoracic vertebra. This quantity could be evaluated using an existing upper neck load cell along with angular displacement data. An additional neck injury assessment technique, created by Gadd, relies on the angle between vertebra to determine an injury threshold. This criterion could be evaluated directly with angular displacement measurement (12). A new ATD device, the Cervical Omni-Directional Bending Apparatus (COBRA), was recently evaluated at the Vehicle Research and Test Center. The COBRA, which fits inside the neck of an ATD, is designed to characterize the shape response of the neck to an impact. The angle of the head relative to the top of the neck, however, must be determined through additional angular motion sensors to completely define the motion of the head/neck complex. An additional potential need for accurate angular displacement data may be for brain injury evaluation. Brain injury is traditionally predicted from head acceleration data. Many researchers believe that injury to brain tissue is more closely related to the relative displacement between the brain and the skull than it is to head acceleration. A brain compliance model is under investigation at General Motors to assess brain injury risks in the Hybrid III ATD. This model consists of a lumped-mass model of a brain attached to the skull with a series of springs and dampers (15). If this brain 1936</page><page sequence="2">compliance model becomes available, the displacement of the brain mass and the skull could be compared to develop a new brain injury criterion. While the need for measuring angular displacement accurately has been well established, the means for doing so has not. There are currently a few devices used to determine angular displacement. These include accelerometer arrays, high speed films, potentiometers, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sensors. All of these methods are evaluated in (7). A new angular velocity sensor manufactured by Systron Donner, the "Quartz Rate Sensor", is included in this paper. Perhaps the most widely used method of determining angular displacement is the linear accelerometer array. These exist in a variety of configurations which differ mainly in the placement and number of redundant accelerometers used. At least nine linear accelerometers must be used to obtain angular motion in three dimensions. Viano (15) cites several potential causes of error in the angular acceleration data. These include transverse (cross-axis) sensitivity, mismatch of accelerometer pairs, misalignment of accelerometer pairs, signal noise, and numerical analysis. When angular acceleration is integrated to obtain angular velocity, then integrated again to obtain angular displacement, the error is compounded. Angular accelerometers do exist, but they are much less common than the linear accelerometers. The angular devices are seldom used because they are notorious for producing very noisy signals. High speed film or video provides another means of measuring angular displacement. This system uses a video camera or cameras capable of high resolution at minuscule time intervals to track specific targets. The film is then digitized to obtain the displacement of the targets. A primary problem with the use of film occurs when the camera's view of the moving target is obstructed by flailing dummy arms, air bags, or the automotive structure. A second problem occurs when the target is not perpendicular to the line of sight of the camera. Rotary potentiometers provide a direct measurement of angular displacement, and are generally believed to be very accurate. NHTSA commonly uses angular pots for calibrating ATD's. The primary deficiencies of potentiometers are their size and mounting restrictions. The pots can not be mounted inside a dummy because they must be rigidly attached to two members experiencing relative displacement. Pots mounted on the outside of an ATD can not be used in most crash tests because they will be damaged by any direct impact to the sensor. In addition, the rotary poť s ability to withstand deflection at high accelerations is limited. A relatively new angular velocity sensor, the MHD, has been used in recent years. Several organizations, including the NHTSA, the Naval Biodynamics Lab, Systems Research Laboratories and the Biodynamics and Biocommunications Division at Wright Patterson Air Force Base have evaluated the sensor in detail. While the sensor's packaging and post-processing requirements seem appealing, all evaluations have shown considerable error in many instances which has not yet been explained. In addition, many researchers express uncertainty over the post- processing requirements. The QRS relies on piezoelectricity to determine angular velocity. A block diagram of the QRS is illustrated in Figure 1 . The double-ended tuning fork and its supporting structure are all fabricated chemically from a single wafer of monocrystalline piezoelectric quartz. Two drive tines are Figure 1 Quartz Rate Sensor Block Diagram (modified from Systron Donner, 1994) 1937</page><page sequence="3">driven at a precise amplitude by an oscillator circuit. This amplitude causes the tines to move toward and away from each other at a high frequency. Each tine has a Coriolis force acting on it of: F = 2 mú)¡ x Vr (1) where m is the mass of the tine, (Di is the input angular rate, and Vr is the instantaneous radial velocity. The Coriolis forces resulting from the drive tines act perpendicular to the plane of the fork assembly in opposite directions. This produces an oscillating torque proportional to the input rotational rate. The pickup tines respond to the oscillating torque by moving towards and away from the plane of the fork, producing a signal at the pickup amplifier. This signal is amplified and then demodulated into a DC signal, which is proportional to the angular velocity of the sensor. The use of a single piece of piezoelectric quartz simplifies the sensor, resulting in excellent stability. The QRS will produce an output signal only in response to angular motion about the tuning fork's axis of symmetry. This results in a very low cross-axis sensitivity. Sy stron Donner reports that the device has no cross-axis sensitivity. METHODS Test Procedure Low-frequency testing was performed using the pendulum impact simulator at VRTC. The pendulum, shown in Figure 2, is typically fitted with a head and neck at its base. The pendulum can then be raised to specific heights and dropped. As the pendulum reaches the vertical position, it impacts a fixed block of aluminum honeycomb. The impact of the pendulum with the honeycomb simulates a step input similar to that of an actual crash. The honeycomb also acts to reduce rebounding and vibration of the pendulum upon impact. Measurement techniques evaluated during this test include the QRS, the MHD sensor, and a 2-accelerometer array. The dummy head/neck configuration typically used on the end of the pendulum was replaced by a steel block. The block was carefully machined to allow proper positioning of each sensor. After the sensors were attached, the block was rigidly mounted to the base of the pendulum. The QRS sensors were first secured on a T-shaped QRS tri-axial mounting block recommended by Systron Donner. The mounting block was then bolted to the bottom of the test fixture block so that each sensor's sensitive axis was correctly aligned. Only the data from the sensor measuring velocity about the y-axis were used in this test, with the y-axis being lateral, the z-axis vertical and the x-axis longitudinal. The QRS 's measuring velocity about the x-axis was included to study cross-axis sensitivity. The MHD used in this test was an ARS-09 model in the tri-axial cube configuration. This cube is designed to be directly mounted ,to the flat surface of the block. Four holes were carefully machined to provide proper alignment. The tri-axial cube contains three sensors such that it is capable of measuring velocity about all three axes. However, the velocity about the y-axis was the only that sensor that was wired. Figure 2 Pendulum Impact Simulator Test Results Displacement data from the linear accelerometers produced very poor results. It was determined that the operating range of the sensors was too high for the conditions experienced in this testing series, and the measured signals were of the same order of magnitude as the noise. Although accelerometers with more appropriate specifications are available on the market, they were not available at VRTC at the time the testing took place. The item of primary interest in most crash tests is the peak value of the quantity being measured, whether it be acceleration, velocity, force or displacement. Because the peak displacement values are known for this particular test series, it was not necessary to calculate theoretically exact angular displacement curves. The initial and final values and the general shape of the curves are known. The angular position curve should start 1938</page><page sequence="4">from zero degrees, increase parabolically, and reach the drop angle at impact. For clarity, one representative displacement plot for each drop angle is included in this section. The plots obtained from the full test series are included in Reference 7. Figure 3 illustrates the displacement obtained from the QRS and MHD sensor when the pendulum was released from a 30° incline. Displacement at drop angles of 75°, 90°, and 110° are given in Reference 7. The results from the QRS appear superior to the results from the MHD sensor. In each case, the QRS data exhibit the expected shape for the drop. The curve shows that the pendulum bounces back slightly at impact and rests near the expected angle. The MHD data exhibit a somewhat similar shape, but consistently exhibit displacement data that is higher than the actual value.

The table shows that the QRS exhibited an error of less than 2% for all of the tests run. The MHD, however, produced errors no better than 5.37%, and as high as 10.71%. Discussion of Low-Frequency Test Results The results of this test series indicate that the QRS is a viable alternative to traditional angular measurement sensors in the low-frequency environment. The calculated error of between 0.45% and 1.98% is acceptable for the vast majority of crash test applications. Additionally, the post- processing required to achieve displacement from the raw data was much simpler than that required for the other two methods evaluated here. One disadvantage of the QRS is its size. It is much larger than the accelerometęrs tested, and slightly larger than the MHD sensors tested. The T-shaped block required to mount the sensor adds to the bulk of the instrumentation. For most applications, the QRS and its mounting kit are sufficiently compact. However, some applications may have space or weight limitations that may prevent its use. Figure 4 illustrates a size comparison between the tri-axial QRS, MHD, and accelerometer instrumentation. Note that the QRS and MHD configurations shown here are sufficient to measure rotation in three dimensions. Three additional accelerometer cubes, with a total of six additional accelerometer s , would be necessary for three-dimensional calculations. The MHD sensor did not achieve impressive results in this test series. Large error values were calculated for the entire range of drop angles. An additional disadvantage is the cumbersome post-processing required by the compensating routine. Head/Neck Pendulum Testing Without Forehead Impact A Hybrid III head and neck were rigidly attached, upside down, to the end of the pendulum arm. Figure 5 illustrates this configuration. The pendulum is released from a preset drop angle and impacts the aluminum honeycomb when vertical. As the pendulum arm impacts the honeycomb, the head and neck rotate freely about the base of the pendulum. Measurement techniques evaluated during this series include the QRS, the MHD sensor, an accelerometer array, rotary potentiometers, and high-speed video. Figure 6 illustrates the mounting of the head instrumentation. This special edition Hybrid III head is designed to accommodate four precisely machined and positioned accelerometer mounting blocks which allow easy instrumentation of a nine- accelerometer array. Endevco 7264 linear accelerometers were mounted at the eg on the x- and z-axes, and at the top of the head on the x-axis. Also included in the head was a GSE three-axis neck transducer, designed specifically to fit in the base of the Hybrid III skull. This transducer measures Figure 4 Size Comparison of Various Sensors 1940</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5 Hybrid III Head and Neck Attached to Pendulum Figure 6 Internal Head Instrumentation (modified from Denton) 1941</page><page sequence="7">forces in the x- and z-axes, and the moment about the y-axis. VRTC technicians created a special fixture for this test by modifying a Systron Donner tri-axis mounting bracket. A single ARS-01 MHD sensor and a QRS1 1-03600- 100 were mounted to the fixture, and the fixture was mounted to the base of the inner skull. The fixture was carefully created such that each sensor's sensitive axis would be fixed along the appropriate axis. Assuming the dummy skull undergoes rigid-body motion, all points on the skull will experience equivalent rotational velocity and acceleration. It was therefore unnecessary for the sensitive axes of the rotational sensors to align with the head eg. Additionally, potentiometers were mounted to the outside of the head/neck assembly. Figure 7 illustrates this configuration. Tabs were welded to both the outside of the skull at the head eg and to the base of the neck. These tabs anchored each rotary pot. A linear sliding potentiometer was attached between the two so that the head potentiometer measured the head angle relative to the neck angle. The linear pot was used for a convenient sliding axis; linear data were not necessary for angular calculations. The tests were recorded with a nac high-speed video system. An endevco 2262-200 accelerometer measured the rotation of the pendulum arm. Test data were recorded using the VRTC 's DSP Technologies data acquisition system with all circuit parameters as specified by the sensor manufactures. Data were sampled at a rate of 10 kHz. All sensor data were filtered to 1650 Hz in accordance with SAE Class 1000. To obtain varying impact velocities, the pendulum Figure 7 Potentiometer Mounting was dropped from heights of 60°, 90°, and 110°, with 90° being a drop from the horizontal position. Two trials were conducted at each height to ensure repeatability. Test Results and Discussion A major obstacle in the analysis of these test results is the lack of exact theoretical data by which to gage the performance each measurement method. A theoretical simulation with sufficient accuracy would be quite complex and beyond the scope of this study. It was therefore decided to gage each method's performance against the result from the potentiometer instrumentation. NHTSA accepts potentiometers as a legitimate method for ATD calibration. When used within their specifications, rotary potentiometers produce very accurate results. In addition, potentiometers take a direct measurement of angular displacement so that error is not introduced from any post-processing requirements. The plots obtained for the full test series are included in Reference 7. Figure 8 illustrates the displacement of the head eg after the honeycomb impact when the pendulum was dropped from 60°. One may note several interesting trends in the plotted data. The QRS data follow the potentiometer data very closely in both shape and magnitude. The video data also adhere well with the pot data, but the curve is quite choppy. This choppiness is due mostly to limitations on the resolution of the digitizing process. The accelerometer data are very close to the potentiometer curve up until the maximum displacement. After this point, however, the curve begins to taper off. This occurrence is not unexpected since the accelerometer data undergoes multiple integrations. Because integration is a cumulative process, it is likely that the error will increase as time increases. The compensated MHD data appear to follow the shape initially, but then taper off before the peak is reached. Although this test is shorter than the specified time for which compensation is required, using the compensating routine on the data did improve the results. However, the peak results are still low in all cases. The difference seems to become worse as time progresses. Table 2 shows a compilation of the peak displacement values calculated from each measurement method along with the percent difference as compared to the potentiometer data. This table also demonstrates some interesting trends. While the difference in the QRS data is generally small, the value increases as the drop angle increases. The MHD data exhibit differences as large as 7.27%. The differences in the MHD data decrease as drop angle increases. Both the accelerometer array data and the video data exhibit small differences for all drop heights. A power spectral density (PSD) analysis was performed on each test in this series to determine the frequency content of each signal. Figure 9 illustrates the power spectrum for a pendulum test dropped from 110°. PSD plots (see Ref. 7) illustrate the relative quantity of a signal that exists at a particular frequency. Peaks on the PSD plot occur at the dominant frequency or frequencies which 1942</page><page sequence="8">Figure 8 Rotation Measurements for Head/Neck Pendulum Drop from 60° Table 2 Peak Displacement Values for Head/Neck Pendulum Test Series Test Drop Potenti- QRS Difference MHD Difference Acceler- Difference Video Difference Number Height ometers (%) (%) ometers (%} (%) 019 60° 49,39 48.99 0,81 45.80 7,27 47.16 4.51 50.21 1,66 Õ2Õ 60° WÜM 5086 t~05 47J9 WT 50Ī6 2ÂÎ 5Z2Õ ĪM 02Ī 90° WAS êãõõ zñ 6Ī53 543 6588 193 71ÏÏ3 Ķ&amp;T* Õ22 90° 6&amp;Ï2 70TTÕ 2L9Ì 6448 534 664Õ 2J2 ! 7Ť53 500 023 ĪĪČF 7ĪM 7Í24 4^23 65Ö9 441 7ZÎ5 129 75Ī2 546 024 TĪO^ 7185 74.53 3.73 6536 4M 7ZÎ6 043 7554 544 are in a particular signal. The value of power magnitude is a relative number and can not be compared directly from test to test. The PSD results are very similar for all drop heights. The PSD plots show that most of each signal is concentrated around 4 and 5 Hz. There is no significant frequency content above 7 Hz, and essentially zero content exists above 20 or 30 Hz. In this particular head/neck application, the QRS appears to perform well. Results from all six tests agree with the potentiometer results within 4.23%. Additionally, a single integration of the test data provided the displacement results. The reasons for the percent differences increasing slightly as the drop angle increases have not been determined. The PSD analysis demonstrates that all of the tests were run well within the frequency range of the QRS sensor. It is possible that the difference is due to higher inaccuracy in the potentiometers in this range. However, the slight increase is not significant enough here to cause alarm. Although we were able to mount the QRS sensors in the Hybrid III head, the physical characteristics of the QRS are less than ideal for this application. Measuring the rotation about all three axes would require the use of three QRS's mounted on a tri-axial mounting kit. By itself, the kit fits fairly easily inside the skull with some minor modifications to the existing hardware. However, the kit takes up most of the skull's space, making it difficult to include other instrumentation in the head. A more significant problem may be that the total weight of three QRS's and the mounting kit is 320 grams (11.3 ounces) before cabling is added. ATD heads are precisely constructed and calibrated to model representative human weights and eg locations. Heavy instrumentation in the head alters both the weight and eg location. Most ATD heads have ballast which can be moved, added and subtracted to adjust for the weight and eg 1943</page><page sequence="9">~ -x iď ~ 2.5ļ : - ; ; i i ; : : i : - i : ; : : : : ¡ : - : : i : : ; :i : - i M Nili Mli! 1 1 IIIIIĒSSi!!

This modification may or may not be a problem, depending on the nature of the test being performed. Somewhat larger discrepancies were noted between the MHD and potentiometer measurements. These discrepancies ranged from 4.41% to 7.27%. These results are surprisingly poor based on several other publications (11, 13, 6, 18) which reported moderately better results in similar experiments. None of the publications detail the post- processing of MHD data, including whether or not a compensating routine was used, and what variable inputs may have been used. The Laughlin and Willems reports compared angular velocity measurements, not displacement, to angular velocity calculated from accelerometer arrays. The error may be smaller in the velocity measurement, and then magnified when the data are integrated to obtain displacement. ATA has rated the bandwidth for the ARS-01 model used for this test at 0.3 to 1000 Hz. All significant frequency content was found from PSD analysis to be within this range. It is conceivable that the performance of the MHD sensor declines towards the low end of its bandwidth. For the tests discussed here, the peak displacement value occurred sooner than 100 milliseconds. It was assumed that the compensating routine would not improve results because of this short duration. However, the routine did improve results significantly. This is most likely due to the fact that the MHD sensor is in motion for several hundred milliseconds while the pendulum is falling. This motion occurs before the initial test event, the honeycomb impact, occurs. Any pre-event motion must be added to the test duration when making decisions regarding use of the compensating routine. The MHD sensor has some advantages over other methods. When the compensating routine used in the low- frequency test series is not needed, displacement results are obtained by a simple integration. Also, at 200 grams (7.05 ounces), a tri-axial MHD cube is lighter than the QRS and less likely to significantly affect the eg location in the head. Finally, unlike the QRS's, the MHD sensors can be used singly without the mounting cube, making them much more compact in applications requiring measurement about a single axis. The peak displacement values calculated from the accelerometer data agreed fairly well with the potentiometer data. Discrepancies ranged from 0.43% to 4.51 %. These differences are within the allowable range for most crash test applications. However, the trend of the accelerometer data to increasingly stray from the pot data as the test progresses should be mentioned. In tests of a longer duration, the accelerometers will produce poorer results because of the accumulating integration error. One reason accelerometer arrays are so commonly used for head instrumentation is because the mounting fixtures and related hardware are readily available. The Hybrid III head, as well as most ATD components, is available with built-in accelerometer mounting utility. Although the number of sensors required is high, the mounting hardware usually does not have to be created or modified. The high-speed video results are reasonably good. Peak displacement differences range from 1.56% to 5.88%. The video curves tend to follow the potentiometer curves throughout the duration of the test. However, in these particular tests the head motion was constrained on the X-Z plane. The video targets were not prone to a parallax effect nearly as much as they would be on an unbelted ATD in an automobile crash. In addition, this test was set up so that no obstructions were present, although they may necessarily appear in other tests. As mentioned earlier, this test series presented an ideal environment for potentiometer usage. The type of destructive modification necessary to affix potentiometers to 1944</page><page sequence="10">the ATD is not always acceptable. Nor is the obtrusiveness of the configuration tolerable in all experiments. These limitations are particularly true in crash and sled tests. The mechanism used here measures rotation about the y-axis only. If measurement of rotation about any other axis were required, finding points to anchor the rotary pots to would be much more complex. A potentiometer configuration that measures rotation about all three axes simultaneously would be extremely complex and obtrusive. Head/Neck Pendulum Testing with Direct Forehead Impact This test series is very similar to the head/neck pendulum testing previously described. The difference is that after the initial honeycomb impact, the head swings around and strikes a steering wheel. The steering wheel was instrumented with a six-axis load cell. Only three of the axes were recorded for this test: the normal and tangential force, and the moment about the y-axis. A special fixture, illustrated by Figure 10, was designed to attach the steering wheel to the load cell and hold the wheel at an adjustable distance from the head. The steering wheel force data were collected to determine how the instruments respond when impact to a rigid object occurs in a crash or sled test, such as to the steering wheel or A-pillar. The pendulum impact simulator and the Hybrid III head and neck are identical to that discussed previously. As before, measurement techniques evaluated during this series include the QRS, the MHD sensor, rotary potentiometers, and high-speed video. Accelerometer data was not collected from this test due to channel limitations. The data acquisition process is also identical to the process described previously. Two pendulum drops were conducted at 60°, and three were conducted at 90°. Higher drops were not Figure 10 Steering Wheel Impact Simulator attempted for fear of damaging the ATD head and its instrumentation during the steering wheel impact. Test Results and Discussion As in the previous test, results from this test series are compared against the results from the potentiometer instrumentation. Since the results vary from test to test, even when the tests were conducted at the same pendulum drop angle, all five of the tests in this series are included and discussed in this section. Figure 1 1 illustrates the head displacement after the honeycomb impact for test 004, which represent a drop angle of 60°. Figures 12 illustrates the head displacement for test 007, which was a pendulum drop from 90°. Table 3 explicates the peak displacement values calculated from each measurement method along with the percent difference as compared to the potentiometer data. Greater variation exists in this test series than in the previous two. The QRS agrees well in both shape and magnitude for all tests except Number 007. For this particular test, the QRS measures 9.48% higher than the potentiometers. The MHD shows percent differences ranging from 3.10% to 9.59%. The video results demonstrate significant differences, as high as 29.25%. The video data is also very choppy. There is probably significant error in the high-speed video data. As the forehead hit the steering wheel, one of the digitized targets became difficult to track. This is particularly true at the peak displacement which occurs during the steering wheel impact. A power spectral density (PSD) analysis was performed on each test in this series to determine the frequency content of each signal. Figure 13 illustrates the power spectrum for pendulum tests dropped from 60°. The PSD results are very similar for both drop heights. The PSD plots show that all of the signals exhibit peaks at 5 Hz. There is no significant frequency content above 7 Hz, and essentially zero content exists above 20 Hz or below 2 Hz. Size, weight, and post-processing considerations are identical here to those in the previous test, and will not be repeated here. However, the performance characteristics will be discussed in detail. There is significant variability in the peak displacement between the first pendulum test from 90° and the third 90° test. The same steering wheel was used for all the tests in this series. It is very likely that the first 90° test, number 007, hit the steering wheel hard enough to deform the wheel and change its stiffness. In the second test, the forehead hit a softened wheel and was able to travel further. This effect was even more significant on the third test. The QRS appears to perform well in all of the trials except Test Number 007. Tests 004, 006, 008, and 009 exhibit differences between 2.33% and 4.49%, and follow the shape of the potentiometer curve throughout its range of motion. It is unclear why the result of test 007 is so poor compared to the other tests. The PSD analysis of the entire test series shows no significant difference between the frequency concentration in this particular test and the rest of the test series. 1945</page><page sequence="11">Figure 11 Rotation Measurement for 60° Drop, Test Number 004 Figure 12 Rotation Measurement for 90° Drop, Test Number 007 The MHD data were examined in their compensated and uncompensated forms, and again compensation improved the data. Therefore, the compensated data are presented here. The discrepancies found for tests 004 and 006 were relatively small. The discrepancies were a bit higher for tests 007 through 009. The video data here showed very poor results. Following any one of the displacement curves, one notices a large deviation from the potentiometer data right around the peak. This deviation decreases after the peak and then seems to catch back up several seconds after the peak. Apparently, the digitizer loses the target as the forehead strikes the steering wheel and then finds it again after the head rebounds.

CONCLUSION Evaluation of Measurement Techniques Five different measurement techniques were evaluated for this study. These techniques include direct measurement from rotary potentiometers, digitized video analysis, and indirect measurements from QRS's, MHD sensors, and translational accelerometers. Each technique has unique characteristics which make them suitable for different applications. Quartz Rate Sensor Evaluation The QRS has proven to be a viable alternative for measuring displacement in many typical ATD tests. Test results indicate that the QRS provides accurate results in both low and medium frequency environments. Unlike some other methods, only one sensor is required to measure rotation about each axis, which simplifies the test configuration and data acquisition. There are some characteristics which may make the QRS undesirable for a particular test. Sy stron Donner specifies the QRS's bandwidth as "greater than 60 Hz", with a -3 dB point at 75 Hz. Signals from tests such as direct windshield impacts, which may contain frequency content above 60 Hz, should not be recorded with this sensor. Tests with strict weight limitations may not allow the 320 gram sensor. Additionally, the size of the QRS limits it to use in the larger body components such as the skull, chest, or pelvis. Ideal applications for the QRS include measurement of the angle of the chest and pelvis. The QRS is also suitable 1947</page><page sequence="13">for head measurements in low and medium frequency tests. The QRS is also ideal when one needs to reduce the number of data channels required due to limited channel availability. MHD Sensor Evaluation The MHD has limited uses in ATD applications. The MHD showed decent accuracy in the both of the head/neck tests, but is marginal for the low frequency pendulum block test. There is the possibility of additional "user error" in MHD test results because of potential misuse of the ill-defined compensating routine. The primary advantage of the MHD is that it has very high frequency capabilities, much higher than the QRS' s or potentiometers. Like the QRS, only one MHD sensor is required for obtaining data about each axis. For measurements in three dimensions, the MHD is available in a compact tri-axial cube. Ideal applications for the MHD include any measurement of motion which contains extremely high frequencies for which more accurate sensors are not available. These applications may include examination of some non-biofidelic responses in an ATD. Accelerometer Evaluation Accelerometers have long been used for ATD response measurements. The data presented in this study show good accuracy from the accelerometers in the medium frequency range. Because accelerometers have been widely used in the past, the fixtures required to mount them are already in place inside many ATD components. This availability makes them convenient to use. In addition, an accelerometer can be added by drilling two small holes, which can be considered a minimal alteration to the dummy. The use of translational accelerometers to measure angular rotation also has some drawbacks. Typically nine accelerometers are used to measure rotation about three axes. The MHD and QRS methods require only three sensors. With many data acquisition systems, accelerometer usage will limit the number of channels available for other purposes. The post-processing required to obtain rotational displacement need also be mentioned. The multiple integration process accumulates error in the displacement data. Longer tests will continue to accumulate error as the test progresses. Accelerometer arrays are ideal for measuring angular rotation when a test requires the array for other purposes such as acceleration data. For an application such as this, no additional instrumentation would then be required for the displacement calculation. Tests in which excessive instrumentation is not an issue could make use of an accelerometer array. Rotary Potentiometer Evaluation Rotary potentiometers do provide accurate results, but their mounting requirements restrict their use significantly. Obtaining rotation about a single axis requires two potentiometers to be rigidly attached to the ATD with a sliding axis between the two. This configuration must be mounted externally on the ATD. Necessary modifications usually require permanent alteration of the ATD component. The sensors and their sliding member can not be subjected to any direct impact. Therefore, potentiometer use is restricted to tests in which motion is very constrained. Ideal uses for rotary potentiometers include constrained tests such as the head/neck pendulum tests, as described in this study. High-Speed Video Evaluation High-speed video is very useful in ATD testing, but should not be used as a primary means of obtaining angular displacement data. The video's accuracy ranged from excellent to terrible in the medium frequency tests. When used in ideal settings with optimum lighting with motion constrained on a small single plane, the video is very accurate. However, few applications are this ideal. Many potential problems may arise from video analysis, including the parallax effect described earlier and obstructed views of targets. The resolution of the digitizing process is also limited, which results in choppy data. Despite its limitations for providing accurate displacement data, high-speed video is a very useful tool. The digitizing process is simple and inexpensive, and provides a quick ballpark check on other data. More importantly, video provides a visual record of a test. When oddities surface in sensor data, video data can provide important clues about their origin. For instance, unusual data spikes or broken body components may be the result of an unexpected collision between a body part and a test fixture or another body part.
