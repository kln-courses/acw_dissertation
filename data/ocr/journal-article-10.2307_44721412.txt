<plain_text><page sequence="1">740117 Sensitivity Study of Occupant Response in Simulated Crash Environment Stanley H. Backaitis National Highway Traffic Safety Administration DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS, and particularly after the issuance of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, a controversy arose over the questions of repeatability and hu- manlike performance of the crash test dummy in a crash environment. In numerous conferences and other technical meetings, in responses to the federal government docket for occupant crash protection, and in a number of test dummy evaluations, the question was addressed, a substantial volume of related data was generated, and in general the issue became nearly polarized. The question was extended to include the concepts of simplicity and repeatability, or realism, com- plexity, and potential lack of reproducibility (1)*. McAdams, in his study for the U.S. Department of Transportation (2), addressed these topics to some extent and concluded that repeatability and realism are essentially contradicting each other, and both must be reconciled. In theory, there is no reason why a complex dummy, which is ideally perfect, cannot be as repeatable as an extremely sim- ple dummy in an ideal test environment. Ideally, the more complex dummy, which simulates the human skeleton, mass distribution, and other physical properties, is just as repeat- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. able and provides considerably more kinematic realism than an oversimplification. This can be shown very vividly with computer models, such as the action of a two-mass occupant simulation system versus eight-mass (Fig. 1). The eight-mass model certainly has more realistic kinematic action (Fig. 2): it loads the restraint system to nearly the same magnitudes and time phasing as that experienced in a simulated sled crash and it is capable of intercepting and evaluating the vehicle's interior surfaces. In comparison, the two-mass system, which has a mass distribution identical to the eight-mass model but has all of the joints, except for the hip, locked rigidly, over- loads the lap and the shoulder belts during the forward colli- sion by more than 50% (Table 1). Subsequently, the shoulder belt becomes unloaded while the lap belt remains overloaded. The two-mass simulation translates considerably different amounts at the hip and at the chest, and in the end, it nearly submarines during rebound. The two-mass model is simply not adequate for even a reasonable evaluation of occupant pro- tection systems in a crash environment. On the other hand, the eight-mass mathematical occupant model appears to be reasonably suitable to evaluate many occupant parameters and those of the crash environment in which the simulation is em- ployed. The ability of the mathematical model to reproduce without variance identical test results is ideal for the study of ABSTRACT . The sensitivity of response of crash victim simulation was investigated using a two-dimensional, mathematical eight-mass model. The model was exercised in the forward collision mode in a three-point restraint system using a trapezoidal forc- ing function. Mass and inertia parameters of the occupant simulation, its setup, and the restraint and environment sys- tems were evaluated individually and as groups, in terms of their effects on the occupant's head and chest acceleration. The study also investigates and rates the effects of shape and time duration of the forcing function upon the response of the occupant. 563</page><page sequence="2">564 S. H. BACKAITIS Fig. 1 - Occupant dynamics in two-dimensional simulation subsystem parameter relationships and of their relative im- portance in the complete operating system. OBJECTIVES This study was undertaken to: 1 . Evaluate the sensitivity of the occupant's responses to his physical parameters in one restraint mode. 2. Evaluate the sensitivity of the occupant's responses due to his initial positioning and sensor location. 3. Evaluate the sensitivity of the occupant's responses in terms of external contact parameters, such as the restraint system, seat, and other contact surface characteristics. 4. Evaluate the sensitivity of the occupant's responses due to interaction of occupant, setup, and external contact group parameters. 5. Evaluate the sensitivity of the occupant's responses in terms of impact pulse shape characteristics and pulse duration variations. The study was limited to the response sensitivity evaluation of a simulated occupant in a three-point restraint system using a two-dimensional, eight-mass model mainly because of the relative simplicity of simulation and ease of defining its char- acteristics and because the restraint system elongation ex- ceeds local deflections of the occupant segments by a large margin. Because of the limitations of the two-dimensional model, it is realized that the data generated in this study are some- what limited and must be used with caution and substantial subjective judgment. There is no question, however, about the model's repeatability, since one may run the same model over and over again with always the same results. Departure from this ideal into real-world testing brings about many problems. Considerable effort was expended during the past few years to show how unrepeatable the dummy is on one hand (3); on the other hand, much work was performed to determine whether or not the system can be made significantly more repeatable (4-6). The question of repeatability and realism is difficult to resolve experimentally because it is nearly im- possible to provide perfect test conditions, to record the measurements with a perfectly repeatable data acquisition system, and to build a perfect dummy without manufactur- ing tolerances. Such tasks, however, can be accomplished with relative ease through mathematical modeling. It is hoped that sensitivity trends established in this study will provide a more thorough understanding of the relative importance of each element in the crash test system and that it will provide a basis for improvement of repeatability and reproducibility of test results and of understanding the variance that remains.</page><page sequence="3">SENSITIVITY STUDY OF OCCUPANT RESPONSE 565 Fig. 2 - Comparison of occupant dynamics in two-dimensional simulation and actual experiment Table 1 - Comparison of Significant Occupant Response Lap Belt Shoulder Belt Experimental Experimental Two-Mass Eight-Mass Hybrid II No. Two-Mass Eight-Mass Hybrid II No. Model Model 955 Model Model 955 Max belt loadings, lb 2980 1950 1820 2320 1900 1450 Max horizontal hip translation, in 12.9 10.2 «11.0 Hip angle change, deg 24.0 8.0 «11.0 Head rotation, deg -0.0 63.0 «77.0 Head translation, in 10.1 14.3 «15.0</page><page sequence="4">566 S.

Availability of time limited the scope of this study primarily to the evaluation of parameters in the for- ward-collision mode in the three-point restraint system in general and to the first collision of the occupant in particular. The study does not take into account the occupant's sensitiv- ity during the second collision. Its consideration would have confused rather than clarified the picture. It was felt that the rebound phase is of only marginal importance in the overall crash-survivability picture and therefore should not be given much attention. The need for selective judgments was stressed by McAdams in his paper (8): "one must be very selective by which measures the repeatability or sensitivity of the total system is to be evaluated." What is the criterion by which judgments about the system may be made? Current practice to evaluate dummy perfor- mance is highly varied. In certain cases, dummy accelerations are the criterion, in others, the head severity index (HSI) or the head injury criteria (HIC) is the measure. Some researchers use the belt-loading-time relationships as a useful measure. With respect to the latter, no useful correlation has been found between occupant load-up of the belt system and the re- spective accelerations of the various body segments, and no significant trends were noticed in belt loading when rather sig- nificant occupant and forcing function parameter variations were employed. The use of HSI and HIC for the measurement of performance variability was not found useful for this pur- pose because they tend to exaggerate artificially larger dif- ferences between performance levels and minimize the smaller ones. Other techniques, such as averaging of the running mean, tend to hide significant aspects of the occupant's performance, and thus a measurement of sensitivity which is averaged becomes rather meaningless. It was found, with reservations, that the best comparator of occupant response sensitivity is the peak resultant acceleration of the head and of the chest- disregarding, for the sake of simplicity, any rela- tionships with respect to time duration or to the time at which the peak occurs. No attempt is being made in this study to weight the selected measures artificially, because the point of immediate interest is the absolute sensitivity of the simulation per se and nothing else. The sensitivity of the simulated test dummy for the pur- pose of this study is being defined as a percent ratio between the deviation from the peak measured value of a particular test and the peak value of the base run. It is hoped that this measure will provide the researcher, the user, and the de- signer with some tangible feel for the relative importance of the various occupant characteristics, the occupant's setup, the restraint system, and the forcing function parameters on the performance of the occupant in the crash environment. It is felt that general trends established in this study will be of similar significance for cadavers and volunteers. MODEL DESCRIPTION The model used for this study has physical and performance characteristics shown in Table 2 and the Appendix. It repre- sents, essentially, the Hybrid II test dummy, 164 lb in mass, as detailed in MVSS Regulation Part 572 (9). The individual body segments are rigid, and no attempt was made to incor- porate or transpose any local flexibilities of the dummy com- ponents to the characteristics of the restraints and/ or contact surfaces. Prior to initiating the sensitivity study, the model's response was compared for equivalency of kinematic excursion</page><page sequence="5">SENSITIVITY STUDY OF OCCUPANT RESPONSE 567 Table 2 - Crash Simulation Program 1 A 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 0.0 2 B 2.0410 0.5400 2.9960 0.4360 0.4740 0.6090 2.6230 2.3970 3 C 960.0000 960.0000 200000.0000 960.0000 230.0000 120.0000 180.0000 0.0 4 D 4.4800 5.7500 12.5900 7.6900 11.5600 10.7500 16.5000 16.1250 5 E 0.0500 0.0470 0.1080 0.0290 0.0250 0.0250 0.0910 0.0500 6 F 3.7600 0.0 3.7600 4.0000 1.2500 2.0000 2.1800 3.7500 7 G 21000.0000 20000.0000 20000.0000 20000.0000 5240.0000 7000.0000 7000.0000 0.0 8 H 60.0000 15.0000 20.0000 20.0000 20000.0000 20000.0000 20000.0000 20000.0000 9 I 150.0000 22.5000 22.5000 70.0000 195.0000 130.0000 120.0000 0.0 10 J 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 0.0 11 K 2.7500 3.1900 5.1700 5.3000 4.8200 7.5000 7.5000 10.1350 12 L 103.0000 103.0000 103.0000 75.0000 -77.0000 0.0 6.0000 -33.0000 13 M 0.0 2.0000 0.0 145.0000 7.170 6.0000 5.0000 1.0000 14 N 1.0000 92.0000 0.1000 0.3400 37.2100 5.3100 1.5700 13.0000 15 O 12.1000 13.5000 16.8000 2.5500 50.0000 0.0005 2.0000 1000.0000 16 P 1.0000 0.3150 1.0000 50.0000 0.0 625.0000 -12.0000 -12.0000 17 P 2.0000 0.3150 1.0000 77.0000 0.5000 350.0000 0.0 0.0 18 P 3.0000 0.3150 1.0000 -39.0000 0.5000 350.0000 0.0 0.0 19 Q 1.0000 0.5000 0.0780 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 20 Q 2.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 21 Q 3.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 22 R 2.0000 528.0000 528.0000 3.0000 0.0050 0.2000 5.0000 1.0000 23 S 0.0 45.0000 0.5000 0.5000 45.0000 -10.0000 0.1000 3.0000 24 T 0.0 0.0 800.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 25 U 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 26 S 1.0000 40.0000 0.0100 0.9500 -3.0000 -0.5000 0.1000 283.0000 27 T 1.0000 0.0 800.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 28 U 1.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 29 S 8.0000 36.0000 05000 0.5000 18.5000 10.0000 0.1000 135.0000 30 T 8.0000 0.0 800.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 31 U 8.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 32 U 2.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 33 U 3.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 34 U 4.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 35 U 5.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 36 U 6.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 37 U 7.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 38 U 9.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 39 V 1.0000 1.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 40 V 1.0000 1.0000 0.0200 -9650.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 41 V 1.0000 1.0000 0.0547 -9650.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 42 V 1.0000 1.0000 0.0747 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 43 V 1.0000 1.0000 2.0000 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 44 Z 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 NS = 11 1=1 3344445788 A=11312341608 and load-time relationships with actual test runs of the Hybrid II dummy (Figs. 2, 4, and 5).

Head-sensitive parameters were subsequently grouped, and group sensitivity was established by selecting in the group all of the parameters that minimize or maximize the head response. In addition, the minimum-maximum groups were further combined to establish the system's sensitivity. The parameter groups that make up the system's sensitivity were added as follows: 1. M&amp;I + JTS. 2. (M&amp;I + JTS) + SU. 3. (M&amp;I + JTS) + SU + (R&amp;E). In order to have a more realistic perspective of what hap- pens in the real world, the occupant, its setup, and restraint and environment groups were also examined at the extremes of their commercial design tolerances and compared against the sensitivity of the basic occupant in terms of head and chest responses. Furthermore, the forcing function param- eters were evaluated against the forcing function that pro- duces the lowest occupant response in terms of peak head and chest accelerations. The comparison matrix also includes an evaluation of system sensitivity relative to pulse length. The pulse shapes studied are as follows: 1. Square wave. 2. Trapezoidal. 3. Sinusoidal. 4. Triangular symmetrical. 5. Triangular ramp-down. 6. Triangular ramp-up. No attempt is made to rationalize the chain of events and the associated mechanics that cause certain levels of sensitiv- ity. This investigation is intended only to establish the rela- tive importance and the interrelation of the various occupant,</page><page sequence="8">570 S. H.

TEST RESULTS MASS AND INERTIA (M &amp; I) CHANGES - Fig. 7 shows the effects of varying ±10% the mass and inertia of the head, the torso, the legs, and the arms on the acceleration magnitudes of the head and the chest. The chest acceleration values are, in general, considerably less sensitive to mass and inertia varia- tions than those of the head. The increases and decreases of the head M&amp;I cause the head acceleration to decrease, although not by the same proportions. The decrease in the torso and arms M&amp;I causes the head acceleration to increase, and an increase in their M&amp;I decreases the head response. The increase or decrease in the legs M&amp;I causes similar changes in the head acceleration. Decreases in the head, torso, and arms M&amp;I increases chest acceleration and only legs show a decreasing effect. The study of cumulative effects on the head response shows that the head M&amp;I accounts for the largest portion of the total sensitivity in the minus direction, and the legs account for nearly all of the change in the positive direction. SENSITIVITY OF HEAD AND CHEST ACCELERATIONS DUE TO SHOULDER, NECK, LUMBAR SPINE, H-POINT, AND KNEE JOINTS (JTS) STIFFNESS VARIATIONS - Fig. 8 shows the effects of joint stiffnesses upon the head and chest accelerations as multiples of the normal 1 g joint-setting or equivalent torque resistance for the particular joint. In the order of importance relative to head accelerations, the neck stiffness provides the most sensitivity, while the knees and shoulders are least effective (less than 1%). Lumbar spine is the next most sensitive joint, followed by the hip joint. The neck and the lumbar joint stiffness affects the head acceleration by an inverse ratio, whereas the hip stiffness affects the response by a direct ratio. Except for the neck, the effects of other oc- cupant joints upon chest acceleration are of minor significance, with the lumbar spine and the hip joints being slightly more important than the shoulder and the knee joints (less than 1%). The cumulative performance of the head is being controlled mainly by the neck in the negative direction and by the lumbar spine and the neck in the positive direction. ORIENTATION EFFECTS OF HEAD, TORSO, UPPER LEGS, LOWER LEGS, AND ACCELEROMETER LOCA- TION - Head orientation with respect to the horizontal (shown in Fig. 9) has the effect of decreasing its acceleration as the head is inclined forward from 75 deg initial orientation from the horizontal reference to 70 deg. The head acceleration in- creases only slightly when the SI centerline of the head ap- proaches the vertical position. The chest acceleration at 75 deg of head inclination reaches the lowest value of sensitivity and varies at approximately the same rate of change as the head is moved to either side of the initial orientation. The torso inclination toward the rear increases both the head and the chest accelerations and reduces them as the torso S I centerline is oriented toward the vertical. The upper leg inclination reduction has minor effects upon the head ac-</page><page sequence="9">SENSITIVITY STUDY OF OCCUPANT RESPONSE 571 +10 Ü ~ í i 8 Bļ g i a - ■ - I 1 i 2 LUMBAR HIP SHOULDER KNEE i £ w 2 LUMBAR HIP SHOULDER KNEE £ Z vi ¿ Z S Ž ^ 2 -*&gt;. ¿ ź CO y $ g ¿ y I $ ?

I Fig. 10 - Head and chest acceleration sensitivity due to restraint system and environment changes celeration, but rather significant effects on the chest. In- creases in the inclination angle have only nominal effects on the chest and the head. Lower leg orientation has minimal ef- fects on head accelerations, but rather significant effects on the chest when the leg inclination is increased from 33 to 38 deg with respect to the horizontal reference. The head ac- celeration response is extremely sensitive to the head acceler- ometer location. It indicates that variation in location of 1 in will change the results by over 20%, whereas the chest accel- erometer positioning effects are only one-fourth as sensitive for the measurement of chest accelerations. Cumulative effects study of head response sensitivity shows that the accelerometer positioning in the head is of major im- portance, with the torso, the upper and lower legs, and the head orientation effects being of relatively minor significance. RESTRAINT SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL EF- FECTS UPON OCCUPANT RESPONSE SENSITIVITY - Belt stiffness effects appear in Fig. 10 to be more significant at lower belt rates than at higher ones for both the head and chest accelerations, although the chest in general is more af- fected than the head. Energy-absorption effects of belts are of only moderate significance for head and chest accelerations similar to those exhibited by seat stiffness and seat friction. Seat friction, however, is of significant importance during the rebound phase (not part of this study). Belt slack is of little significance for head sensitivity, but it increases the magnitude of the chest response by nearly 8% when the slack is increased just by 1/2 in. Energy -absorption characteristics of the toe- board rank second in significance relative to the head response. Cumulative effects show that belt stiffness control is of major importance on head acceleration. Energy-absorption characteristics of the toe-board and of the belts, while of some significance, are only of secondary importance. CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF PARAMETER GROUPS - The cumulative effects of the four groups on the head accelera- tion were evaluated in the following order: 1. M&amp;I + JTS. 2. (M&amp;I + JTS) + SU. 3. (M&amp;I + JTS) + SU + (R&amp;E). Fig. 1 1 shows how the various cumulative effects of para- meter groups progressively change the acceleration magnitude of the head in the increasing and decreasing modes under the influence of excessive parameter variance.

Fig. 13 shows cumulative mini- mum-maximum effects upon the response of thełiead and chest for the three groups. Table 3 identifies the parameters studied and shows the ranges of the deviations employed. Maximum Part 572 dummy head acceleration variance be- cause of cumulative occupant tolerance effects (M&amp;I + JTS) is less than ±5%. The addition of the worst possible stack-up of SU tolerances, which were given reasonable liberal allowances, raises the cumulative total [(M&amp;I + JTS) + SU] to ±9%. The cumulative total of the head response for the entire system, which includes the occupant, the environment, and restraint system effects [(M&amp;I + JTS) + SU + (R&amp;E)] , is slightly less than +14 and - 10%. The chest response is affected by the M&amp;I + JTS parameters groups more in the increasing mode (+7%) than in the decreasing mode (-4%). The addition of the SU parameter group lowers the chest response to a total of -5% at minimum stack-up of tolerances, and it increases to + 12% at maximum tolerance accumulation. The restraints and the environment (R&amp;E) group has practically no effect on the chest response in the decreasing mode and only one additional percentage point in the increasing mode. SENSITIVITY OF HEAD AND CHEST ACCELERATIONS DUE TO SLED DECELERATION - Pulse Characteristics - A total of six forcing function pulse shapes were studied for effects upon head-chest accelerations, each at three levels of duration simulating essentially the com- pact, the intermediate, and the large car crash pulse lengths, and each representing 30 mph crashes. The square-wave simu- lation was performed with an onset and dropoff to and from the maximum g level, respectively, for 1 ms duration. Simi- larly, the onset and dropoff to and from the peak acceleration for a triangular shaped ramp-up or ramp-down pulse, respec- tively, were also kept at 1 ms. The trapezoidal pulse for 60 ms has an onset and dropoff of 10 ms, and for 100 and 140 ms pulse durations, they are 20 and 30 ms, respectively. Table 4 shows head and chest acceleration sensitivity due to sled deceleration pulse variations. The triangular ramp-up waveform produces the lowest head and chest peak accelera- tions for all three pulse durations and is used herewith as a baseline for comparison.

The chest acceleration variance is maximized (+100%) by the sym- metrical triangular pulse and it is minimized by the triangular ramp-down pulse at 44%. OVERVIEW OF OVERALL OCCUPANT SENSITIVITY - Occupant Parameters - As a group, the more important oc- cupant parameters that affect the sensitivity of occupant re- sponse are, in order of importance, as follows: 1. Head: (a) Neck stiffness. (b) Head M&amp;I. (c) Torso M&amp;I. (d) Legs M&amp;I. (e) Lumbar stiffness. (f) Arms M&amp;I. (g) Hip stiffness. 2. Chest: (a) Neck stiffness. (b) Torso M&amp;I. (c) Head M&amp;I. (d) Legs M&amp;I. (e) Lumbar stiffness. (f) Arms M&amp;I. (g) Hip stiffness. Segment Orientation and Accelerometer Location Param- eters - The occupant's accelerations are affected by acceler- ometer positioning tolerances and by the orientation of occu- pant segments, whićh are listed in the order of importance, as follows: 1. Head: (a) Head accelerometer location. (b) Torso orientation. (c) Head and lower leg orientation. (d) Upper leg orientation. 2. Chest: (a) Lower leg orientation. (b) Upper leg orientation. (c) Head and torso orientation. (d) Chest accelerometer location. Restraint System and Environment Parameters - The head and chest accelerations are affected by variances of the re- straint and environmental parameters, listed in the order of importance, as follows: 1. Head: (a) Belt stiffness. (b) Energy absorption of the toe-board. (c) Energy absorption of belts. (d) Shoulder belt slack. (e). Seat stiffness. 2. Chest: (a) Belt stiffness. (b) Shoulder belt slack. (c) Energy absorption of belts and of the toe-board. (d) Seat friction. SENSITIVITY OF PARAMETER GROUPS - In the M&amp;I and JTS group, the head response of the Regulation Part 572 dummy is fairly well balanced between the minimum and the maximum tolerance stack-ups. The chest accelerations appear to be slightly more sensitive in the increasing mode than in the . decreasing. The setup tolerance group, when added to the M&amp;I and JTS group, appears to favor the increase of head and chest response. The addition of the restraints and environ- ment group has significant effects upon head accelerations, but it has practically no effect upon the chest response. OCCUPANT'S RESPONSE SENSITIVITY DUE TO PULSE SHAPE AND PULSE DURATION - The lowest occupant re- sponse in terms of peak g levels for the head and chest is being experienced with the triangular ramp-up pulse for the three particular pulse durations studied. This pulse shape, however, produces the most sensitivity to head acceleration variations due to changes in pulse duration. The sinusoidal pulse produces the highest chest accelerations for the 140 ms pulse duration, whereas the trapezoidal and the symmetrical triangle wave- forms give the highest response with the 100 and 60 ms pulse durations, respectively. The lowest head sensitivity due to pulse duration variance is produced by the triangular ramp- down pulse. The highest chest sensitivity for the 140 ms pulse duration is produced by the square wave pulse, and by the symmetrical triangle for the 100 and 60 ms durations. The highest chest sensitivity due to pulse duration variance is encountered with the symmetrical triangle pulse shape and the lowest with the triangular ramp-down pulse configuration. CONCLUSIONS 1 . The response of the crash victim in the three-point belt restraint and no contact mode is sensitive to variations in occu- pant mass and inertia distribution, joint stiffness, segment</page><page sequence="15">SENSITIVITY STUDY OF OCCUPANT RESPONSE 577 orientation, measuring sensor location, restraint and environ- mental factors, and forcing function characteristics. 2. In the mäss and moment of inertia parameter group, the control of the head, torso, and leg parameters is of significant importance for the attainment of low crash victim sensitivity. 3. In the joint stiffness group, the control of the neck and of the lumbar spine is of significant importance, with the shoulders and knees being of lesser effectiveness. 4. In the segment orientation and acce 1er omete r position- ing group, the head is mostly affected by the head acceler- ometer location and torso positioning, whereas the chest ac- celerations are mostly affected by the orientation of upper and lower legs. 5. The head acceleration sensitivity is highly affected by belt stiffness properties and by the energy -absorbing charac- teristics of the toe-board. The chest acceleration is also sensi- tive to belt stiffness properties and to increases in belt slack. 6. Seat stiffness and seat friction appear to have little ef- fect on head and chest accelerations during the first collision mode. However, the occupant kinematics, the head accelera- tions to a considerable extent, and to a lesser extent the chest response are significantly affected during the rebound mode by seat friction. 7. Part 572 test dummy appears to be well controlled and reasonably well balanced within the mass and inertia and the joint stiffness factors studied for sensitivity in the positive and negative directions. 8. The assumed setup and accelerometer location toler- ance, which is considered commercially reasonable, appears to favor primarily the increase of accelerations by approximately similar levels as that produced by the M&amp;I group. This, per General Motors study (6), may be further reduced by employ- ing elaborate occupant orientation and setup techniques. 9. The assumed commercial variance for belt stiffness and for toe-board energy absorption ranges, whose effects on dummy response are smaller than those produced by the M&amp;I and SU groups, could be further improved with closer control of vehicle manufacturing tolerances and tighter control of safety belt properties. 10. The occupant's response is highly influenced by the shape of the forcing function's pulse and by its duration. The triangular ramp-up pulse shape appears to be the best for keep- ing down the acceleration magnitudes of the occupant; how- ever, it is most sensitive to repeatability of the head response if the stability of the pulse duration is in question. The tri- angular ramp-up and ramp-down pulses are best for the con- trol of chest acceleration magnitude as well as repeatability, whereas the symmetrical triangle and the square wave shapes yield the largest dispersions and the highest magnitudes. 1 1 . No relationship has been established between occu- pant's inertial response in terms of acceleration-time history and the magnitude of belt loading. 12. The two-mass articulated simulation appears to be, within the framework of this study, unsuitable for the evalua- tion of occupant protection systems in the automotive crash environment.
