Reviewed by RALPH ALTMAN University of California, Los Angeles The author intended this book as a study of the Tiwi tribe of Melville Island, Aus- tralia, "made through the medium of their art, their myths, and their ceremonies." He calls it a preliminary study, and it must be evaluated as such. It is a welcome and valu- able contribution, particularly as a collection of a large body of myths, descriptions of ceremonies, and a vast number of photos of Tiwi arts, including the dance. It is im- portant for everybody concerned with Australian anthropology or primitive arts and will be indispensable for future research. But it is not a "study" of the tribe, nor of any one facet of its culture. Mountford stresses fundamental differences between Tiwi and Australian mainland cultures (although admitting on the last page that he may have exaggerated them). He explains them as the result of insular isolation of the Tiwi. His suggestion that some distinct elements in their beliefs might "represent those of one of the aboriginal migra- tions to Australia" (p. 178) makes one miss a statement about the physical anthro- pology of these people. It is regrettable in general that the author fails to introduce his specific research by a sketch of the people and their land, society and, particularly, the degree of their acculturation. Burial ceremonies are represented as the most important complex in Tiwi ceremon- ial life, overshadowing another which involves initiations and different grades, rain magic, supernatural spirits, and a species of yams. But only a hazy picture could be drawn of the latter, for it appears to be largely a matter of the past; some of the data recorded were gained from reconstructions staged at the author's request. Did it always play such a relatively minor role as he seems to imply? The present degree of elaboration of the burial complex does seem unparalleled in Australia. Its description fills nearly one-third of the book and is extremely interesting. Remarkable wood-sculptures, poly- chromed poles, and anthropomorphic statuettes are used in it which invite comparison with East Arnhemland sculpture. Yet little attempt was made to establish a basis for such comparison by analysis of the styles of sculptures, regardless of their function. The author seems tentatively inclined to regard Tiwi and mainland sculpture as dis- parate. The discussion of their common or different origin, their autochthonous or in- trusive nature, raises many questions. The reviewer is unable to regard the alleged Malayan origin of Arnhemland sculpture as proven fact. He disagrees with Mount- ford's statement that "the Malaggan burial ornaments of New Ireland" are "the only examples of burial posts outside of Australia . . . that are in any way comparable in function to those on Melville Island" (p. 109). The function of these columnar carvings from Northern New Ireland has nothing to do with burial. Even those living trees which are customarily marked at burials in the Central Darling River area (Western New South Wales) might be referred to as burial posts with greater justification. And the function of some of the sculptures (conjoined with ritual sham attacks) of the Asmat of Southwest Dutch New Guinea appears to have more in common with that of Tiwi posts. The author implies that the sole function of these posts is to please and distract the ghost of the dead, which the living try to elude by the application of face paint. Did the author grasp the full significance of ritual and ritual object? His own observations raise doubts in such simple explanations. They seem inadequate in view of the mourners embracing the poles; of their sticking heads or arms through openings in fenestrated</page><page sequence="2">1156 American Anthropologist [61, 1959] poles; of the fact that carving, painting, erecting must be done by people not closely related to the dead but identified with spirits of the dead (p. 32 footnote). Moreover, it seems hard to believe so much communal effort should be mobilized for the sole purpose of propitiating one dead individual. Poles as well as bark containers and separate sheets of bark are covered with similar painted designs. This similarity is explained as the effect of the paramount posi- tion of the burial ceremony, but such a statement reveals misconceptions about the nature of style. The similarity noted must be understood as effect of style, i.e., of the one mode of visual expression which, among the Tiwi, overrides differences in function and in the media used. To what extent this is really the case has not been examined, how- ever. Style is of little concern to the author. His interest in art seems focused on its in- terpretation in terms of subject-matter depicted. Instead of analyzing the style, he states Tiwi art (meaning painting) is "formalized" and its interpretation requires the artist's explanation, in contrast to the "representational," "decorative" art of the ad- jacent mainland as typified by bark and rock paintings of Oenpelli. (There is no men- tion of presence or absence of rock paintings on Melville Island.) The term "formalized" seems inappropriate in this context; a representational image can be as formalized as a geometric pattern. It would have been more meaningful to say that Tiwi, in contrast to Oenpelli, artists predominantly combine into patterns those design elements which appear to us to be nonrepresentational, and only rarely incorporate life forms. The majority of patterns tend to occupy the entire area available to the artist. The effect thus created is highly "decorative," and this term seems to fit Tiwi art better than Oenpelli. Further, a few Oenpelli bark paintings are just as nonrepresentational as Tiwi paintings; some of the apparently representational ones are basically as unintellig- ible to the uninitiated beholder as are those of the Tiwi, particularly where X-ray de- sign is combined with, or replaced by, unnaturalistic patterns. No doubt there are fundamental differences between Oenpelli and Tiwi styles of painting, but they seem hardly more basic than those existing between Oenpelli and Northeast Arnhemland style, or between either of these and the Wondjina style of the Kimberleys. Tiwi in- sularity alone does not explain the unique character of Tiwi art. Moreover, Tiwi and mainland arts, especially Northeastern Arnhemland arts, seem to share more char- acteristics than comparison with Oenpelli style alone indicates. However, it seems to the reviewer fruitless to think in terms of style comparison before style analysis has es- tablished criteria for such a comparison. So far one can only voice vague impressions. One is impressed by the combined use of straight-lined and curvilinear design elements, of amoeboid color areas and relatively naturalistic imagery. The latter resembles some Central Australian pictographs. The use of broad bands of color and relatively large color areas in some paintings recalls Northwestern Queensland style. One wonders whether such apparent design relationship might be associated with a genetic relation- ship of the inhabitants of the two areas. The lack of a definition of Tiwi style is further regrettable in view of the fact that the paintings are not reproduced in color, that their dimensions are not given, and that the captions fail to differentiate paintings on sheets of bark and on bark containers. According to Mountford, "under normal tribal conditions ... it is in the carving and painting of the elaborate burial poles and the ceremonial spears, coupled with the deco- rating of the large bark baskets, that the aborigines of Melville Island find an outlet for their artistic efforts" (p. 19). Yet about two-thirds of the illustrations show bark paint- ings and most of them are not on containers. It is not explained what is meant by "normal" tribal conditions. It says the Tiwi painted the walls of their bark shelters. Do</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1157 any of the paintings shown come from shelters? Were some or all made at the author's suggestion? Nothing is said about the function of bark paintings other than those on baskets. One group of illustrations is classified as secular paintings. Are the others, the majority, religious? The author expresses the hope that others will continue his work among the Tiwi, and his material suggests many lines for future inquiry. For example, names and photos of three of the painters are given, but information about their life and personality is needed; such data should be relevant in a partly acculturated society. How many other artists' work is shown? The study of individual creativity within traditional arts will be helped by including the artist's name in the captions. Mountford records interesting observations on this subject. Do the illustrations convey a typical cross-section of Tiwi painting today, insofar as style and subject matter are concerned? It is interesting to know how consistent an artist's interpretation of his own work is, how he would respond to it at a given time after he gave his initial explanation. How do Tiwi ignorant of the artist's explanation react to a painting? Publication of a large number of paintings together with the interpretation of their subject matter is among the great merits of the book. Unfortunately, no serious attempt has yet been made to approach the tantalizing problem of relations between form and symbolic content. Most paintings shown deal with creation myths and totemic ances- tors. They tell no story, depict no action, but, for example, symbolize the topography of a totem center. It is the myth itself-and not its pictorial representation-which ex- plains topography as effect or as site of mythical events. Action is symbolized by its effects or by objects used in such action (e.g. pl. 2-B, weapons) or by ubiquitous tracks (ibid.). The body of myths is represented as a collection of episodes, united by the facts that they took place within a definite period and that the actors were linked by kinship. Myths validate Tiwi ritual and ceremonies. Yet the author represents them as if they had no actuality for the Tiwi. Mythical times seem a closed chapter, unrelated to current life. There is no inkling of the timeless quality of an "eternal dreamtime" as described from some areas of Australia. There is no hint of the people's identification with totemic ancestors or of any ceremonial reliving of the events reenacted. Concepts one might paraphrase as "reincarnation" seem nonexistent. Occasionally one cncounters a vague suggestion of the existence of a concept of an eternal life force (p. 41, footnote; p. 120, et al.). One is tempted to attribute symbolic value to the fact that the first men- tion of this concept is relegated to a brief footnote: one can not escape feeling that the author mistook the recording of myths and the pageantry of ceremonialism for a study of the underlying philosophy. The author's method, approach, evaluation of data are open to much criticism. But this review cannot do justice to the wealth of new material which this provocative and stimulating book embodies.
