<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pursuing Revision in Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" Nancy Moore Goslee Like Intellectual Beauty, the elusive and barely humanized power evoked in Shelley's 1816 "Hymn," Liberty in his 1820 ode has almost no physical or anthropomorphic characteristics even when she is reported present. Though both personifications are rhetorical figures, abstract words describing concepts but brought alive as individual human fig- ures, this lack of visual representation is particularly striking in the ode. One of Shelley's purposes in the "Hymn," after all, was to show how inadequate are human beliefs that the "names" of "God and ghost and heaven" are actual transcendent forces to whom we can relinquish re- sponsibility for our world. Though Intellectual Beauty may be such a transcendent power, our very uncertainty about its manifestations in this world prevents us from idolizing it. Yet the difficult, almost para- doxical history of liberty (with a lowercased Z) over the preceding three decades involved not just the acting out of revolutionary freedom but the concrete representation of Liberty as a human figure, usually a woman, surrounded by emblems of her power. If James Thomson in the mid-eighteenth century could repudiate the Phrygian cap once worn by freed Roman slaves to declare his goddess wreathed in British oak leaves, Shelley in 1820 works against a far stronger array of public im- ages: the "bonnets rouges" were worn or held by countless figures of Liberty in cartoon, statue, and procession during the French Revolu- tion.1 Though the height of this public, visual representation occurred in the early 1790s, we might expect Shelley to revive those images of Lib- erty as he writes to support the outbreak of rebellion in Spain that Jan- uary. Yet he does not. Instead, he uses visual images and other allusions drawn from classical myths to humanize and make more complex the allegorical personification of "Liberty." He then controls the ambiguous, alien power of those myths- a power associated with female energies- by reminding us that he writes allegory, that Liberty is a word, and a word we have responsibility for as individuals and as soci- eties. His allegorization, then, is no easy slide into conventional eigh- teenth-century phrasing but a deliberate choice.2 This choice emerges as Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 36, No. 2, Summer 1994 © 1994 by the University of Texas Press, P.O. Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="2">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 167 a dramatic "plot" of the published 1820 text, but it is a plot we might well miss without looking at his manuscript drafts of the poem. As he writes, he discovers this allegorical turn. In Festivals and the French Revolution, Mona Ozouf describes the use of allegorical personification in the Revolutionary processions as both a making present of virtues and ideals to evoke the support of the people and also a distancing of that presence, by placards with abstract labels and emblems, to control communal enthusiasm.3 Her analysis agrees with Stephen Knapp's suggestion that allegorical personification be- comes effective because it represents the "fanatic" in a safely archaic form- semi-mythic, semi-incarnate, yet reducible to a word. Another suggestion that Knapp makes would seem less adaptable to a visual, public procession or tableau: he argues that the astonishing uneasiness with which critics responded to Milton's Sin and Death, allegorical fig- ures in a mimetic epic, comes from the fear that if words can become personal agents, then personal agents such as God might also be dis- solved into words.4 Yet though this threat of contamination is perhaps stronger in a verbal text, it also emerges in the visual and verbal allego- ries of the French processions. When Reason appears not as a larger- than-life figure of plaster but as an actual woman, and an actress at that, the living figure seems to undermine or contaminate her abstract "meaning" because she is living, because she is an actress, and perhaps most important because she is a woman. Because Liberty, some observ- ers complained, is emotional, volatile, and nurturing, it is appropriately represented by a woman, whether plaster or flesh- but Reason, a tradi- tionally male virtue, deserves better.5 Once the allegory came more alive, the audience wanted the figure to be a more "natural" or moti- vated sign, even a synecdoche, and was less able to tolerate any distance between sign and signifier. This gap between what is being represented and the representation becomes, in Paul de Man's theory of allegory, the authentic recognition of temporality- and thus of our destiny as mortal beings. Thus by means of its very fictionality, its arbitrary connections, allegory becomes more honest to the human condition than is the Coleridgean symbol, with its synecdochic, motivated link between immanent and transcen- dent realms.6 This recognition or turn toward temporality, however, is not a turn toward specific ongoing political and cultural history, so much as a turn toward individual, yet universal, conditions of life. Thus, de Man's theory of allegory does not seem to describe exactly what Shelley does in this very public, historical ode, nor, however, does the theory of personification that Clifford Siskin develops to challenge de Man's. Social and political changes, he argues, alter the use of rhetorical figures, which in turn define the supposedly personal changes of an</page><page sequence="3">168 Nancy Moore Goslee individual poet. Siskin argues not for a rhetoric of temporality but a tem- porality of rhetoric. Personification from the mid to the end of the eigh- teenth century shows a kind of collective personhood, reflecting the social and historical moment, while those from Wordsworth and other Romantics represent a private self, but a self also constructed by the so- ciety.7 Yet if Siskin's theory rightly points to a more collective, communal function for rhetoric, Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" challenges his chronol- ogy for this change. The questions raised by these theories, however- Ozouf's, Knapp's, de Man's, and Siskin's- can help us read the particular history of Shelley's highly individual composing process, a process through which he comes to represent glimpses of a figure of Lib- erty through Western history. As we trace his development of the "Ode" in Bodleian MS. Shelley adds, e.6, we can distinguish, I think, five stages before the version printed in the 1820 volume.8 These are not separate, full drafts, but rather five steps in his sense of the poem's shape and direction. If we look at the small parchment-covered notebook in which Shelley drafted the "Ode to Liberty," we can see, first, a rough sketch of celebratory lines welcoming a new spirit (14^16), a sketch probably written in fall 1819, and then, once Shelley has turned the notebook around and begun to write on what had been the blank verso pages, a long, almost unin- terrupted struggle to write the ode that responds to the Spanish rebel- lion of January 1820. Each stanza has at least two successive, heavily emended drafts, and some many more. I see three stages in this long sequential draft. In the first, beginning on page 147r, he drafts and re- drafts the stanzas that eventually become 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, and then 5. Be- ginning with a Hobbesian state of nature, he eventually proposes Athens as a model, in its interdependent development of liberty and the arts, for all later civilizations. Before writing stanza 7, he apparently in- tended to turn straight to Spain and England as new habitations - receptive or no- for Liberty. But just before what is now stanza 7, he crosses out the phrase "Look England" and turns to Rome. He does so, I think, because he recognizes at this point that he can adapt and subvert the genre of the Whig progress poem, by tracing the "westering" of Lib- erty through history and across Europe.9 At stanza 13, he reaches En- gland, Spain, and the present moment in Liberty's westward journey, where rebellions have just broken out, then turns to Germany and Italy, where they should do so. He thus completes the "progress" model and what I call stage 3. As if questioning those earlier models and their com- munal images of Liberty, the fourth stage of the poem shows an in- creased self-consciousness about icons, idols, and names. From his draft of stanza 15, where this new stage begins, through rejected drafts of stanza 18, this process eventually enables him to draft a belated repre-</page><page sequence="4">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 169 sentation of the French Revolution and of Napoleon that becomes stanza 12 in the published version. Stage 5 exists only as a gap between e. 6 and this final version. The manuscript is missing three significant, if brief, sections: a complete version of the final stanza and two images that il- lustrate the extreme negative and positive images of Liberty acting in history: the fascinating image of Liberty's agency as Praxitelean sculptor in stanza 5 and the figure of Napoleon in stanza 12 as the "bewildered Anarch of thine [Liberty's] own powers." The Harvard fair copy note- book for the 1820 volume, I should note, includes only the first two stan- zas of "Liberty."10 In this paper, I shall look very briefly at Shelley's changes in stanzas 3 and 15 and then consider the most direct and the most ambiguous rep- resentation of Liberty, a recognition of "progress" in the pivotal stanza 7 that rests upon an archaic and terrifying female role. Stanzas 3 and 15 both describe societies dominated by political and religious tyranny. In the third, a Hobbesian society just past a brutish state of nature submits to agents of total power: "Tyranny," with a capital Γ, and his "Sister- pest," organized religion. Though this society exists before Liberty's manifestation in Athens, her progress westward and to the present re- veals only the same oppression by "king" and "priest." Shelley's at- tempts to describe the "Sister-pest" in stanza 3 move from mythic monstrousness to a cooler allegory; similarly, his attacks on king and priest in stanza 15 move from actual rulers to a recognition that these titles are only words from which belief may be withdrawn. From his first draft of stanza 3, Shelley borrows a Wordsworthian line about individual crisis and makes it social. In Resolution and lndq)endence, the speaker asks whether the manic creativity of Chatterton or Burns ends in "despondency &amp; madness" because "By our own spirits are we deified."11 On page 145r Shelley's ink draft over pencil seems to apply "deified" to "the pavilion / Of the sun's fire," then cancels that version of nature worship and writes on the next line, "And their own passions having deified." Though he also cancels this line, its Wordsworthian yet communal, even Durkheimian, projection of deity leads him to revise his characterization of religion, the "Sister pest" of tyranny, in his next several drafts of the stanza. On the next page, below some lines in ink from the Phaedo concerning the fate of souls after death, a line continues in the same pencil that he had used at the top and bottom of page 145r: "But Harpies." He then wrote in ink, "Were each a tamo harpy." Revising in ink over pencil, Shelley develops three variants of the harpy polluting a feast as a figure for the "Sister-pest." Though this invective of obscenity, darkness, and destruction seems appropriate enough for his intentions, he moves from these mythic semiwomen to a slightly more naturalistic and less</page><page sequence="5">170 Nanq/ Moore Goslee misogynist version: "from furious [?b - ] blackened birds / Shook dark- ness on / Its shadows on the world ..." (144r). The next draft of stanza 3 does not occur until page 133r, after Shelley has bogged down in a third draft of stanza 4. In both this and the next draft of stanza 3, he makes the image even less direct: from harpy to bird to wings: "Shepherds whose kind is gold &amp; tears &amp; blood / Drove / Un- der the shadow of her pinions wide / Anarchs &amp; Priests, who feed on gold &amp;." On page 132r, the next version, his fifth, is even more abstract: on other hearts sat deified The sister-Pest, congregator of slaves Ana For Priests &amp; Anarchs under her wings [?wide] Feeding on what pollutes their gold &amp; blood Drove thy [? - d] herds of men from side [to] side This version on page 132r, the final one we have in MS, is very close to the published version: For thou wert not; but o'er the populous solitude, Like one fierce cloud over a waste of waves Hung tyranny; beneath, sate deified The sister-pest, congregator of slaves; Into the shadow of her pinions wide Anarchs and priests, who feed on gold and blood Till with the stain their inmost souls are dyed, Drove the astonished herds of men from every side. (Unes 38-45) Instead of the "obscene" harpy, half-woman, half-bird, is a parody of several Miltonic personifications and images: Chaos and Night, Sin and Death, and even more outrageously, the paraclete, who dovelike broods over Milton's abyss. This figure of religion presides over an antimass of gold and blood. If we lose both the specific Wordsworthian allusion of individual human responsibility for deification and the specific classical allusion of the harpy as monstrous, we gain a more coolly abstract ac- count of how idols are constructed or concepts "deified." The image of the monstrous woman will appear in the less obscene but still terrifying representations of Liberty herself, which he begins drafting a few pages later. A sketch of a small tree marks the top of page 128r, perhaps drawn as Shelley decides how to describe Liberty after her Athenian perfection. He first writes, in the same ink as the sketch and the preceding page's version of stanza 6, "Look England"- an apt admonition for the pur-</page><page sequence="6">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 171 pose of his whole poem- but then crosses it out and writes below, "Then Rome stopt [or possibly 'crept'] forth was. . . ."At this point, his third major reconception of the poem begins, as he cast it into the genre of the progress poem, the march or "westering" of Liberty from ancient times to modern, from Eastern to Western Europe. Whether intention- ally or not, he has already challenged a fundamental premise both of the Whig progress poem and of its predecessor, the classical Renaissance Astraea myth. In both of these, the harmony of a golden age is symbol- ized by the presence of a goddess- Astraea or Justice in the earlier myth, Liberty in Thomson's and Collins's odes, and Poesy in Gray's. In the stanzas that develop this history of Liberty's erratic progress (7-12), Shelley alludes to both of these myths but employs them critically. Most important, he changes Liberty herself from an offended virgin too pure for this corrupt world to a threatening yet nurturing mother, a figure as- sociated with myths of women who break free from a controlling male gaze to assert a revolutionary violence. Like Blake, whose "westering" description of the progress of poesy in the Poetical Sketches Geoffrey Hartman describes as Dionysian (199), Shelley questions the appeal to a classical order and to "progress." Both the Astraea myth and the Whig progress poem find in present circumstances and present rulers a con- gratulatory hope for the future. Shelley too finds hope, but in the aboli- tion, not the praise, of present rulers. Thus representing a ruling deity, even of Liberty, is- to borrow W. J. T. Mitchell's terms- both an icono- logical and an ideological problem for him.12 In the progress poem, the two extremes of a triumphal progress and a pilgrim's progress, one highly public and political, the other very private and spiritual, are balanced, if not quite fused. As Wallace Jackson sug- gests about Gray's "Progress of Poesy," the "westering" course of a per- sonified spirit gives momentum to static emblem or pageant but also raises questions about changes over time both for whole cultures and for individuals whose lives may be bounded by the setting sun.13 Offsetting the threat of death is the apparently transcendent if often invisible sta- bility of the spirit or idea, a word as ideal. In Thomson's Liberty and in Collins's two progress poems, the "Ode to Liberty" and "Ode to Sim- plicity," this stability is represented but also challenged through a series of sculptural metaphors. In Collins's revisions of "Simplicity" and in Gray's "Progress," sculptural object yields to creative process, to liminal stages before the shaping of voice, hand, or vision, and thus to a more private, individual perspective that can also represent a turn from law to ecstasy, from Zeus to Dionysus.14 By changing "Rome stept forth" to "Rome was" in his first draft of stanza 7 Shelley makes the city a more passive figure. In a more shock- ing change, he evokes the sculpture that has since the Renaissance</page><page sequence="7">172 Nancy Moore Goslee imaged the city's mythic origins and then reverses its images by substi- tuting another, more threatening myth. Addressing Liberty, he drafts two versions of the end of the first line: "from thy / thier immortal bo- som," then, above that line, "from thy breast Divinest." Then he begins again: "From thy deep bosom fairest / Even like a wolf-cub By / from a Dorian Cadmean Maenad / She drew the milk of greatness" (e. 6, p. 128r). The Roman myth of the wolf who nurses Romulus and Remus, represented in the Capitoline sculpture by the Etruscan wolf and her Re- naissance twins, is transformed to a human mother nursing wolf cubs.15 Shelley's image comes from Euripides' Bacchae, a line from which he quotes in Greek and then labels and cancels in English- "See the Bacchae"- at the bottom of his notebook page.16 Spying on the maenads, Pentheus' messengers report such a scene. Because that re- port leads to Pentheus' own fascinated spying and then to his destruc- tion, seeing this wild nursing mother carries great danger- though a danger controlled, to some extent, by Shelley's placing the mythic figure of the maenad in a simile. The nurslings, however, are not contained by the simile, as Greece, the older child, is not yet weaned. Two variants of the third line read "though thine oldest son" and, just below, "Ionian child." Then, in the next line, he writes, "From that Ether Elysian food was yet unweaned." "Oldest son" recalls the Roman twins Romulus and Remus but is inappropriate because Shelley has already character- ized Rome as "she"; "Ionian child" was apparently prompted by the "Dorian" mother to suggest a primitive origin and an Athenian devel- opment, but "Cadmean" makes the allusion to The Bacchae and its prim- itive violence about origins far more powerful. In ironic contrast to the "Elysian food" offered by this mother, Rome's people enact the "fear- ful" or "savage," if noble, patriotism supported by maternal love: "And in thy smile, &amp; by thy side / Saintly Camillus lived and calm firm Atilius died." Atilius is the Regulus whose death by a torturing Carthaginian sun was painted by Turner.17 Paradoxically, as Liberty becomes palpa- ble, more physically present, her dangerous ambiguity also becomes stronger. Yet as Rome changes, the mythic identity of Liberty changes as well: the city becomes corrupt, and Liberty becomes, in her leaving, a Vestal virgin associated with the virgin Justice, Astraea. She thus becomes a cooler and less dangerous mythic figure than the one suggested by the simile of the wolf-nursing maenad. This inconsistency of character de- velopment sharply reminds us that Liberty is not a character but a rhe- torical figure, even in this stanza where her concrete presence seems most fully developed. In Shelley's two drafts of the Vestal section of the stanza- roughly its last seven lines- he points up this shift from human to rhetorical figure by revising both syntax and visual image toward in-</page><page sequence="8">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 173 creasing abstraction. At the bottom of page 128r, Liberty sees and hears the destruction of the Roman republic: sawest But when thou didst behold the nations burn &amp; bleed And thy And heard their screams and saw the And saw thy Athen- the golden the spoil lightness Of [?earth] Thou didst desert with spirit winged speed many The senate of the tyrants Her active perception and judgment disappear, however, in Shelley's re- vision on the next page (127r). He first writes, "When when thy robe skirt feet of"; these relatively concrete visual images that define Liberty as an objectively seen living woman also disappear, however, as he re- vises the line: But when thy sons would stain thy vestal whiteness Prophanod with gold/gift thy Capitoloan throne With gold &amp; blood &amp; lust &amp; gold The widowed Earth wept tears of blood - thy throne Fell Tears of blood fell- &amp; gold prophaned thy throne. As Shelley makes "whiteness" a quality floating free of "skirt" or "robe"- and of course rhyming with "lightness," already inserted in the draft on the preceding page- "Vestal whiteness" becomes more nearly a moral quality that defines the concept of Liberty. Its abstract- ness also draws the other substantives, "gold &amp; blood," from concrete objects into heraldic or emblematic colors. By the published version, Shelley has removed the blood, as well. Not only is it more vividly phys- ical, but its association with "staining" the vestal's white robe might re- introduce the primitive sexuality and violence evoked by the maenad- mother. Yet the next manifestation of Liberty fuses the alien, militant, and an- tipatriarchal power of the maenad with the pure, evasive, tutelary deity of the vestal. On page 124r, Liberty reappears to wreak vengeance on the "multitudinous anarchy" of the tyrants who hold back the Renais- sance: Huntress of whoso Thou Huntress, [?outsking] the</page><page sequence="9">174 Nancy Moore Goslee swifter With Thou Huntress mightier than the Moon! thou Terror brighter world's [?farthes] Of the earths [?canceled word, unreadable] wolves! Comparing Liberty to Diana, huntress and moon goddess, Shelley then identifies her as "Englands . . . Vestal Queen."18 The wolves suggest both the hounds who destroy the spying Actaeon when Diana changes him into a stag and here, because they too are victims of Diana, Actaeon himself. Not only are Actaeon and Pentheus cousins, and thus cousins also to Dionysus, but they are both witnesses who transgress the wil- derness borders within which women have themselves transgressed male social limitations on their behavior. Both, too, are torn apart in punishment in a version of the Dionysian sparagmos. Shelley's image of Liberty in stanza 5 as a sculptor of Athenian art (a passage added be- tween the adds. e. 6 drafts and the 1820 text) may well develop out of Collins's elision of Rome and Liberty as a fallen, fragmented statue to be given new breath by later artists; this passage makes Liberty far more powerful and the artist far more endangered. Those who come too close to Liberty's uncivilized origins may betray her powers to transform civ- ilization.19 More precisely, the sight of Liberty as object of Pentheus' or Actaeon's fascinated but resisting gaze may lead to two opposing dan- gers: one, that of seeing and being overwhelmed by the primal energy Shelley also represents in this poem and in Prometheus Unbound as vol- canic and imageless; and the other, that of converting sight to icon or statue. Shelley's representation of Liberty strives to avoid representation or to make its process opaque enough for us to recognize the gap be- tween force and figure, idea and emblematic or visual representation. If stanza 13 employs the material conditions that deny liberty to En- glish workers, conditions that use the images of Thomson's poem to contradict his view of Whig progress,20 stanzas 15 and 16 offer a fasci- nating example of how the material conditions used in the composing process can generate not only metaphor but also critical thinking about metaphor. On page 118r, after completing a long rough draft of stanza 14, Shelley writes with a disintegrating pen point so worn that it looks like a bad paintbrush- and this condition may lead to his metaphor, "And him [the King] they blot irrte upon the page of time / Into a legend. ..." On page 108r, after skipping over drafts of "Poor Richard" and several sketches, he begins again, with another point, and at first abandons his image of the blot: "O that the free would stamp the impious name / Of king into the ear* dust, or write it there." Then as he continues with his earlier line, even this better pen makes an ink blot when he writes his</page><page sequence="10">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 175 first word, "That." So he continues, "That this blot upon the page of fame / Were left-. . . path." Then he hesitates again. He has begun an image of a path at the top of the page, above the blot, and struggles for several half-lines below the blot to clarify his figure of a name inscribed, then erased, in sand. A look at his own handwriting may have led to the metaphor of the snake's path and then to a further metaphor for the snake: "Fivil [for fills?] with sand- ο cut that the gordian word / Ο cut that gordian name / Even as a snake's path- Erases- , . . . and his way none may find-." A few lines further, he appeals to Liberty or "the free" to "Lift thy victory flashing sword / And cut the snaky knot of this foul gordian word." Ironically, it is the conqueror and king Alexander who in legend cuts through the Gordian knot. This knot "binds . . . The rods asces &amp; the rods which owe mankind." The 1820 version has "axes," but the image is the same- the fasces, symbol of Roman authority. In a further irony, the French revo- lutionary processions organized by David used the fasces to claim the virtuous, pure strength of the Roman republic. For the modern reader, of course, Mussolini's fascism has corrupted the image or at least the word. Shelley argues that "the name sound [of King] has poison- Tis the sperm" of life's evils, and with a further serpent or phallic image he asks Liberty, like an avenging Christ, "To set thine armed heel on this reluctant worm." Here the snakes are associated not with maenads, as in much classical art, nor with the medusa, a phallic woman who terri- fies and destroys male observers, but with the binding customs and be- liefs associated with the word "king." One wonders whether the sound patterns of "gorgon" and "gordian" play into this tangle of associations and images. This self-consciousness about the power of words, spoken or written, carries over to what will eventually become stanza 16, an attack on "the pale name of priest." The draft of stanza 16, however, comes six pages later, after drafts of the published stanza 17 and several versions of what will eventually, after many transformations, become stanza 18. Using Christian terminology, stanza 17 questions the making of all deities that take on life separate from man's "own firm high will"; for man himself "has enthroned the oppression &amp; the oppressor" (e. 6 and 1820). On page 105r, writing with a finer point, Shelley begins four pages of drafts for stanza 18- twice as many as usual. These drafts are the most icono- graphie images of Liberty in the notebook, and they appear just before the end of his draft- in other words, just before the earlier, very rough version of stanza 12. As he reworks stanza 12 (after stopping work in this notebook), he also rejects the image of Liberty as sculpted object to be worshiped. If he were constructing an alternate image of deity, an</page><page sequence="11">176 Nancy Moore Goslee antideity, in these drafts of stanza 18 he may have decided that any im- age endangers human freedom and autonomy. The image he begins with seems to grow out of the spirits of Earth and Moon in Act IV of Prometheus Unbound and to point toward both witch and hermaphrodite in The Witch of Atlas, the poem that follows "Liberty" in this notebook. Shelley's personification statue is ambiguous even in his first draft (on page 105r): inmost [?pathless] A cavern man's wandring spirit Within thy tomple of the mind of man Enthroned There sits an Idol, so intensely fair the which That every the such adventurous thought that Worships- and its kneeling. . . . By printing "image" for "idol" (610), Hutchinson considerably dilutes the dangers of this figure. Four or five further canceled lines on this page describe "its vest" as "dyed in . . . moonlight," and its eyes, though "deep &amp; dark," reflect something "white and cold." Shelley first crowns this neuter figure in pine, but replaces the Dionysian image with "grass." On page 104r, the deep eyes, usually a positive image, are still further qualified by frozen, sculptural images: Cold still As snowy Image clothed, as thin Moonlight in vestal white May clothe a vapour . . . . . . 'Tis a shape of it is pale as snow Its wings are folded oer its eyes. On the next page, Shelley organizes the paradox between warm eyes and "a cold still image . . . silent &amp; pale as snow." Finally, at the bottom of the page, the image of Ezekiel's chariot becomes more explicit, as he changes to ink, with a wings-over-eyes seraph image. Yet this epiphany, like Ezekiel's vision, offers a chariot but no clearly delineated figure within it. This strange, icy figure within the mind may represent the temptation to construct such idols even out of Liberty. Significantly, his</page><page sequence="12">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 177 draft of the last lines of stanza 18 on page lOlr attempts finally to define Liberty as a word: "O Liberty -if forthat such could be thy name / Wert thou disjoined from" a set of other barely personified nouns of qualities: "Blind Love, / White Faith! Equal Justice, &amp; the Fame ... of eldest Of what has been- and Hope of what will be. ..." Significantly, too, he returns after this passage to balance his attack upon the "name of King" with one upon "that name of Priest." If humans could cast off belief in that name, perhaps human thinking could free itself from the tyranny of words. His passage of a judgment day of thoughts, as if risen free of cor- rupting body words, points ahead to the last passages of The Triumph of Life, though in the later poem it is individual people who shed their pro- jection, their self-created idol masks. Here, as in the preface to Prometheus and in the Defence, words and thoughts are not essentially connected: that essentialism is a form of idolatry.21 With this limitation upon the overordered, overpersuasive power of words, Shelley is free to confront the two strongest examples of anarchy in his poem: the primal horde chaos of animal and human warfare that completes stanza 2 (on page 99r), and the failure of the French Revolu- tion in stanza 12. This draft of stanza 12 is still very rough, and it does not yet contain the central line about Napoleon. As if Shelley, who has had no trouble representing the French Revo- lution in earlier works, has come to share some of Wordsworth's hesita- tion, he delays talking directly about this anarchic outburst of Liberty- and of the personified figures of Liberty whose plaster forms followed the processional routes to the Champs de Mars.22 When he does so, on page 98, the draft in e. 6 is in quite a different pen from that of the pre- ceding pages. Not until the published version, moreover, do we see two crucial images that repeat the ambiguous images of the maenad earlier in the poem. The first of these is Dionysian: How like Bacchanals of blood Round France, the ghastly vintage, stood Destruction's sceptred slaves, and Folly's mitred brood! The second follows from this, describing Napoleon as "The Anarch of thine own bewildered powers"- that is, of Liberty's powers. Shelley's attack on "sceptred slaves" and "Mitred brood" suggests that he makes the forces of earlier tyranny stand, like the Aeneid's gods around Troy, around the apocalyptic winepress of the Terror- but his image of Napo- leon as sharing Liberty's powers links tyranny and a dark, distorted form of liberty again together, in anarchy. On the other hand, in this final compositional stage before publication, he also adds to the stanza</page><page sequence="13">178 Nanq/ Moore Goslee praising Athens the image of Liberty as a sculptor, controlling the im- ages and icons of her own ambiguous power. After the preliminary version of stanza 12, his draft ends. The next page contains a very rough draft of "To a Skylark" -in this context, even more clearly than in the order of the published volume, a longing to es- cape from history's "before and after" into the pure joy of the bird's song. To use the language of "The Cloud," also drafted in Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 6, Shelley "unbuilds . . . again" the sculptural idol of Liberty as a hypostasized mythic deity. Sustaining the idea of an active force or even a conscious agency, he nevertheless insists that such lib- erty is an idea and thus that its agency be claimed by his readers. As we, like his contemporary audience, read the completed poem, we become drawn into the exhilarating progress of Liberty's power. Yet just as the almost autonomous intentionality of that personification- its fanatic will or maenadlike compulsion- becomes stronger, Shelley insists that the figure is only rhetorical and thus subject to our thoughts. Following de Man, Stephen Knapp argues that this turn or collapse toward rhetoric is built into the figure of personification but becomes a source of partic- ular anxiety from the late seventeenth century onward, as deity and word prove all too interchangeable.23 From his composing of Queen Mab onward, Shelley uses both his mythmaking power to create "idols" and his skeptical rhetoric to control the idols of his own and, more often, of society's creation. In an 11 June 1811 letter, for example, he declares that God is a personification created by human fancy. By 1820 his draft notebooks record an acute awareness of both stages- the waxing from word to mythic figure (usually a goddess) and waning to word again. In this flickering pantheon, Liberty is unusual because she is Shelley's own deity and that of his political peers, not a tyrant inherited from others. Thus the processes of his wary celebration become all the more worth watching. To speak more generally about the drafts, we can say that Shelley's notebooks record the traces of changes both in the shaping of visual and rhetorical figures and in the interdependent shaping of genre. Through an avowedly circular process, we can attempt to argue for the dating of passages and works by looking at these differences in figurative lan- guage and genre that we interpret as changes in meaning, and to argue for meaning and realized intention by looking at temporal sequence.25 Thus, even though de Man claims that the material traces of writing cre- ate an opacity, a randomness that "continually exceeds" the "represen- tative function" of the language, we can see in Bodleian MS. adds. e. 6 that a random ink blot or the mark of a thick pen point is read, inter- preted, and made into metaphor in a following draft. In phrasing strik- ingly appropriate for my discussion of the figure of personification,</page><page sequence="14">Shelley's "Ode to Liberty" 179 Frances Ferguson writes about de Man's reading of Rousseau, "the de Manian textual turn . . . insists that language disarticulates bodies- prevents individual humans from being able to present their thoughts as the inner contents of their bodies to others in apprehensible form- because language has a body of its own."26 Yet her metaphors suggest a way of reading these drafts not to deny the author's subjectivity but to affirm it- to affirm, at least, moments of determining meaning through the changes on the material, marked page. Such a turn on the "de Man- ian turn" would make his universal claims about the opacity and thus the undirected play of meaning in language's signifiers more specific to the processes of drafting and thus closely tied to a subject's intention. Like Knapp's, this turn would historicize the subject's consciousness as it is reflected through his revisions of material conditions. Once reinter- preted, those conditions, pen points and ink blots, might then signify the malleability of larger material conditions. In the "Ode to Liberty," as I have suggested, this process becomes even more self-reflexively thematic than usual, both because the central figure is an allegorical personification, an articulated body of inner thoughts, and because that figure represents Liberty. To return to Clifford Siskin's concerns, what are the relationships between the universal, ab- stract word "Liberty," the various inherited representations of the vi- sual, human-shaped, and mythologized figure, the public genre and voice of the progress ode, the collective, public recognition of individual and subjective freedom, and a specific poet's confident yet self-critical representation or even, paradoxically, mastery of these conflicts?27 Though the 1820 volume in which the ode is published might seem far more idealist and visionary than the unpublished political allegories of the preceding fall such as The Mask of Anarchy, "Lines Written During the Castlereagh Administration," or "A New National Anthem," Scrivener and Fraistat have shown how carefully Shelley organizes the published volume to continue encouraging a practical hope for reform among his readers.28 What might seem like the easy idealism of a Platonic Liberty is, more accurately, a radical nominalism that recognizes both the poet's and the readers' aspirations toward a Greek ideal and the dangers of idolizing such belief. Further, through its revision of public iconography and literary conventions, that nominalism can attempt to connect indi- vidual and social aspirations.29 Finally, the ode's model of a temporal "progress" that also creates an audience's progressive recognition of Liberty as idea offers a way to connect what William Ulmer describes as the chiasmic gap between visionary idealism and practical politics.30 At the risk of both overallegorizing and oversimplifying the allegorical personifications of the ode, we might say that the material excess and hence "free" undecidability of its figurative language is a form of anarchy,</page><page sequence="15">180 Nancy Moore Goslee and the historical determinisms reflected in the hierarchical language and structures of power and praise a form of tyranny.31 In de Man's reading, the "free play" of signifiers is itself a form of determinism or tyranny because it exists in all language and hinders all meaning. In my reading of the drafts, such "free play," if at first a submission to a kind of material determinism, becomes conscious and deliberate during the author's rereading and revision of his own drafts. By embodying and then disembodying Liberty first in the free and in some sense subjective play of his drafts and then by incorporating this subjective play within the triumphant public, formal structures of the completed "progress" ode, Shelley manifests his private liberty of intention as a shared civic ideal to be realized in the material conditions of actual life. Thus the drafting process, the central rhetorical figure, and the theme of this ode all illuminate or interpret one another. Not all of Shelley's drafts offer such mutual illumination precisely because his drafts prove so respon- sive to the varying pressures and freedoms- I might say pressures that become freedoms- of occasion, theme, and genre, as well as figure, sound, and ink blot. Yet the hermeneutics of "Liberty's" process- of Shelley's reading and of our own- offer a model for interpreting those tyrannical and anarchic- yet liberating- forces.
