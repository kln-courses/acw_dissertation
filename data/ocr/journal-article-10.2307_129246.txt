Karlinsky explicates, even if very briefly, the complex sexual entanglements of the Merezhkovskii threesome and foursome. He offers us a clearer picture of their sexual preferences than we have had up till now and retrieves the sexual background for certain events of momentous cultural import. It is in- teresting to consider the implications of Diaghilev's turning to ballet and music after suffering the blow of Filosofov's loss to the Merezhkovskiis or to see the Religious Philosophical Meetings as the result of their power struggle for Filosofov. (Karlinsky inaccurately calls these Meetings the Religious Philosophical Society, which was a later assembly initiated by Berdiaev to discuss religious issues.) This kind of cultural criticism can be overdone, but its neglect has been detrimental to Russian literary history and criticism. Karlinsky is correct in referring to Gippius' androgyny as her final solution. Yet it did not really answer any questions for her and ultimately perpetuated her confusion by providing a spiritual explanation for her sexual needs. It is in this context that she found homosexuals more attractive than other men. Zlobin's own views come out more clearly in the chapters on evil and the devil, whose significance in Gippius' life and works he overrates. Maybe she communicated with the devil as did Vladimir Soloviev, but this fact did not determine her world outlook. Zlobin presents his own Dostoevskian epistem- ology of evil, which he may have initially borrowed from Gippius but then developed into a total philosophy. His messianic tone attests to it. The Gnostic teachings of Origen, for example, appear in her cosmogony but should be seen only as a possible alternative she considered rather than her final doctrine. The same is true of her supposed equation of God and the devil. I would question specifically Zlobin's close reading of the famous devil cycle, in which mysteriously he finds references to the October Revolution and its demonic henchmen. He Iowers the poet's demonology to the level of crass anticommunist statement which reflects his 6migr6 politics rather than hers. This is not to say that Gippius was not uncompromising and compre- hensive in her anticommunism. Like the rest of the book, however, these sections contain valuable documentary information and occasional insights into her metaphysics. The translation is accurate and reads well and is a welcome addition to the slowly accumulating Gippiusiana of the last decade. Particularly successful are many of the translations of her poetry, which is still in search of an Eng- lish edition. OLGA MATICH University of Southern California WOODWARD, JAMES B. Ivan Bunin: A Study of His Fiction. Chapel Hill: Uni- versity of North Carolina Press, 1980. xii, 275 pp. $17.50. James Woodward does a commendable job of discussing the basics of Bunin's conception of life, "the conflicting emotional impulses that underlie the entire development of his art- . . . tendencies toward self-detachment from life in all its futility and horror and self-abandonment to its sensual de-</page><page sequence="2">The Russian Review lights." But as much of what he says about Bunin's world view is already established in the critical tradition, Professor Woodward's strongest contri- butions lie in his insights into Bunin's narrative method and the composition of his stories. Especially well done is the treatment of the inadequacies of Bunin's fragmentary composition in the early stories and of narrative retarda- tion in the Dark Alleys collection. Despite my overall favorable impression of this book, I tend to disagree with some of the critical judgments. It is true that "the concept of individual freedom has no place in Bunin's view of life," and I cannot see how Mitia (Mitia's Love) is an exception to this statement; certainly he is not the Promethean figure that Professor Woodward suggests he is. Sometimes over- emphasis on composition may lead the critic astray. For example, he con- siders the structure of The Dreams of Change to be superior to that of Brothers and The Cup of Life but does not treat what is surely more important: the weakness of the story primarily because its lofty philosophical message is presented through the viewpoint of a drunken anthropomorphic dog. One also finds hard to accept the negative evaluation (partially on grounds of composition) of what are two of Bunin's more powerful works, The Son and The Case of Lieutenant Elagin. When Woodward extends the concept of "degeneracy," which he treats well in chapter 6 ("Urban and Western De- generacy"), to the theme of love (chapter 7), the analogy is forced. In Bunin's view human beings have been controlled from time out of mind by instinctual sexuality. But the word "degeneracy" implies that there was some different human condition from which we have now degenerated; the con- cept of "inherent degeneracy" seems specious or paradoxical. Finally, Professor Woodward may be going too far when he remarks that Bunin "has claims to be recognized as perhaps the greatest Russian prose writer of the twentieth century." Despite his many insights into narrative method and structure, the critic does not choose to deal with a central issue in regard to Bunin's prose style. Rhythmic, ornate poetic prose has been out of fashion for some time in Western literature, and one often feels that Bunin's adjective-crammed prose, what Nabokov called his "parchovaia proza," is a bit too exotic and over-lavish. This is not to say that Bunin did not ever succeed with such a style; stories such as Light Breathing, The Gram- mar of Love, and Temir-Aksak-Khan are masterpieces. One also cannot agree that "the reputation of Bunin . . . probably stands higher now than ever be- fore." Certainly it does stand high among Russians, whose literary tradition and temperament somehow make them more receptive to lavishness and ornateness of rhythmic effect in prose, but in my opinion Bunin's reputation in Western literature is quite low at the present time, perhaps much lower than he deserves. Professor Woodward's excellent bibliography includes most of the im- portant articles and books on Bunin in Russian and English.

Swans of Other Worlds: Kazimir Malevich and the Origins of Abstraction in Russia. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research Press, 1979. x, 147 pp. $23.95. This study is an interesting account of Russian avant-garde artistic ac- tivities and movements from 1908 to 1915, and of the diverse theoretical origins of Kazimir Malevich's idea of Suprematism. Professor Douglas points out the importance of Nikolai Kulbin's publications and exhibits of Impres- sionist painters, including the exhibits of Vladimir Izdebskii, among others, in the general formation of avant-garde principles: the "search for essence and the effective use in art of the human psyche," and also the role of the "irrational and the absurd." Avant-garde artists were primarily oriented to psychological impact and "sensation." They believed that new artistic forms, with emphasis on the alogical and the grotesque would arouse a "futuristic" consciousness. Art would reveal the new possibilities of man's psychological conquest of the universe. Professor Douglas discusses the highly fruitful cooperation between Malevich and Kruchenykh, who emerges as a major figure in the book. It appears that Kruchenykh's notion of "transrational language" had a decisive influence on Malevich, who extended that notion to painting. Professor Douglas devotes a chapter, perhaps the best in the book, to their opera, Victory Over the Sun, for which Malevich designed the sets and costumes and Kruchenykh wrote the libretto. Professor Douglas observes that the opera was "an attempt to shock everyone, even the Futurists themselves, into a new consciousness. Victory Over the Sun swamped the senses and saturated the intellect with irreducible objects in order to stimulate the viewer to another level of intuitive and emotional understanding of reality." The last two chapters concern the various influences on Malevich's art and theory of Suprematism. Professor Douglas regards the Italian Futurists (Severini and Boccioni), Henri Bergson, Matiushin and Kulbin, among others, as the major influences on Malevich. I found these chapters to be problematic and often unconvincing. For example, the similarities between Severini's and Malevich's paintings do not necessarily indicate the influence of the former on the latter. Professor Douglas remarks that some of Malevich's "drawings . . . were closely related to Italian Futurist work and were the experiments which provided Malevich with essential concepts and the visual vocabulary for an eventual entry into abstraction." That Malevich "may have seen" Severini's work does not imply direct influence. The same can be said for Henri Bergson, whom Malevich apparently never read, although his major works had been translated into Russian by the middle of 1914. But, as Pro- fessor Douglas indicates, Bergson's notion of "intuition and analysis, time 227</page></plain_text>
