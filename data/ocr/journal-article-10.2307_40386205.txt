<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS By H. Spiegel (Continued from Volume VIII, No. 2) 6. Uli Figures Uli figures belong to a special group of the carved-in-the-round figures, not peg- based. They are very heavy, monumental carvings of anthropomorphic beings of ferocious appearance. As far as one knows, they all come from the hilly inland districts of northern New Ireland and were regarded as specially mysterious and associated with a cult of which very little is known. They were not discarded after the ceremonies, as the Malanggan carvings, but were kept in specially-built small round huts, and used again in the following years at celebrations of extremely secret rites, in which women were not allowed to take part. The Australian Museum possesses two Uli figures and, as far as I could find out from specimens in other collections, they are all of the same type with few variations, mostly concerning the position of the arms. (See D. R. Moore, 1968.) E24808 comes from Siara (Central-west Coast) and E20016 from Central New Ireland. They are all very heavily built and seem to be hermaphrodites with prominent penis and large round female breasts. The heads of such figures are large and all of similar type, namely, showing a bearded face of symmetric proportions, a large bent nose of triangular shape, the eyes deep-set and emphasized by a circle of dark paint pro- longed by a line joining on to the beard surrounding the chin. The mouth is straight and full of teeth, and on top of the head there is always a comb-shaped crest, sitting on the tripartite special hair-do. The torso is cylinder-shaped with short, slightly bent legs and heavy feet. The arms are either given in the usual position held in front of the abdomen, or in a special way bent backwards from the shoulders, with under-arms raised behind the ears. Two small figures of similar type as the Uli figures are sometimes seen beside the head of the main figure. (See W. Schmalenbach, 1956 : Taf. 22b.) Sometimes a small figure is placed between the legs of the Uli figure under the penis (see D. Fraser, 1962 : ill. 94). The head of the Uli figure is mostly light-coloured, the shoulders, breast and genitalia are painted red, and dark spots are placed on flanks and legs. The body of the figure is surrounded by a kind of framework of tendrils, reaching downwards from the elbows to the feet, and also forming a kind of belt in the front. A special ornament, consisting of triangles, based point to base, is carved mostly on to the vertical part of the framework connecting the chin to the belt (see D. Fraser, 1962 : ill. 94 ; W. Schmalenbach, 1956 : Taf. 22a, b ; J. Guiart, 1963 : ill. 295). Some of the figures seem to wear kind of knee-length trousers and a short jacket and ornamental rings on the joints of the hands and feet.</page><page sequence="2">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 195 These last-mentioned characteristics and the backwards bent arms, as well as the crouching figure between the feet of the Uli figure, seem to have inspired D. Fraser (1962 : 177) in his assumption that the Indian Garuda figure, appearing in Indonesia, was the prototype of the Uli figures. G. Peekel (1929 : 1015), however, thinks that these peculiar carvings are connected with the moon cult. He mentions as one of the criteria for this hypothesis the word " ulin " which is the term for moon in New Ireland. He also considers that the bi-sexuality of the figures conforms with identi- fication of the moon sometimes as a man, sometimes as a woman. A Krämer. (1925 : 61) maintains that Uli figures are fertiligy symbols and as those are bi-sexual. He further sees the Uli figures related to the rainmaker figures, which appear as males as well as females. (Krämer also mentions bi-sexual rainmaker figures, which however are unknown to me.) A relationship between Uli and rainmaker figures is observed on p. 198 of this study when that rarely seen ornament of chevrons in a row - that are common to both species - was mentioned. G. Willitsch (1935 · 33$) also sees the Uli figures as moon symbols and refers to the connection between rain, fertility and the moon. Others see them as ancestor figures from primeval times. Whilst one of the characteristics of New Ireland carvings is the great variety present in any artefact showing the same basic motif, the Uli figures show very little variety. They are a group separated from the rest of the art production of New Ireland generally by their uniformity, their powerful sinister appearance, the general use of white paint for their faces, the special head-gear, and hair-do the type of head with the concave-shaped face, similar to some of the New Guiñean (Sepik) masks, and the large, prominent chin, and the absence of attributes. The framework of tendrils (if one can call them tendrils) is used in a simplified way, restricted to two special patterns, one a floral pattern, the other a rarely seen pattern on New Ireland carvings, consisting of a sort of triangles, put point to base in a vertical way. This, however, is the main decorative motif of the Buka ceremonial paddles and is less frequently used in north-east New Guinea and in the west and east Carolines.10 7. Painted and Carved Ornaments The painted decoration on carvings from New Ireland plays an important part in the effect these have on the spectator. They seem to reflect also the degree of artistry and inventiveness shown by their creator. Simpler carvings often show a much less sophisticated decoration of painted motifs than the more elaborate ones. So it seems that both crafts worked hand in hand, and were probably done by the same craftsman. If a decline is observed in the technique of carving, then it is also surely seen in the painted decoration. On the other hand, such sophisticated carvings as the small board from the Queensland Museum, E4518, shows a rich fantasy in the variety of carved motifs, matched also by the delicacy and colourfulness of the painted ornaments. 10 On E524, Rainmaker's head-gear, and on a mask in Dr. Pubi.

Black and white are set in juxta- position in an asymmetric way, mostly showing one eye surrounded by white paint, extending over the nose in a diagonal direction, or accentuating the nose by painted lines, extending across the face of a rainmaker and other figures. There are special ornaments, chessboard or diamond pattern in black, white and red, used for the decoration of the forehead, imitating the forehead bands, which were worn by men and women. Hardly any more elaborate figure exists which is not represented with a belt, either painted only, or carved in bas-relief and painted. Sometimes indication of garments is also given (see H. Spiegel, 1969). Mostly chessboard patterns are used in black and white, red and black, or red and white, or diamond patterns in different colours. The latter is also used to indicate scales on a fish-head emanating from the mouth of the very important mask E564. On that mask straffings, hatchings and cross-hatchings can also be observed to fill in empty space on the surfaces of the mask. This mask is also a very good example to show the special painted fill-work connected with this type of owl masks : the banana-shaped interconnected forms to fill a square space with a circular centre. The necessarily occurring pendantifs in the four corners are always filled with the more or less recognizable derivations of stylized fish. (The latter are well described by A. B. Meyer (1900 : Taf. XIII, text on p. 31). Explanation of Figure i Top row, reading from left to right, 1-4 : Four motifs from D.

These are also frequently seen on palm-leaf paintings from the Washkuk spirit house, on carvings and shields from the same district (Gardi and Bühler, 1958 : 77-81). Saw teeth, or small triangles in rows, as well as zig-zag lines are often used. Triangles in various shapes, used in rows like chevrons, put point to base, pointing upwards or downwards, are mostly seen on Uli figures and rainmakers, and on boards from the Queensland Museum (4518, 524 and E20016). There are special ways of using triangular shapes with truncated points and fringed base as borders on asymmetrical memorial boards, showing birds, from Simberi Island, in open-work, also on kap kaps from New Ireland, and, further afield, on a war canoe from Rubiana, Solomon Islands, in the Australian Museum.11 The value of framing and the use of borders were well understood and frequently used in connection with certain ornaments, especially from Tabar Island. The bodies of birds are examples of this kind of decoration. They are shield-like in shape, with a raised median ridge, a framing double line, surrounded by a leaf-like border (see E3327, and on the Dresden boat figures). Framing is also used on earpieces. There exist special patterns to represent feathers ; consisting of an oblong fish- like shape with a triangular head and long pointed tail end. These shapes may be painted only or carved in bas-relief and painted, mostly in white with black median stripe or black with a white stripe. (E3321, E3327, A14220.) This kind of feather representation is mostly seen on the birds from the memorial boards and also on the large birds sitting on the heads of post figures. Another special ornament, occurring only very rarely as far as I know, is seen on the thighs and legs of two of the post figures from the British Museum, 28-2 and 28 »g, and on the bodies of birds that these figures carry in front of their chest. This pattern consists of a black vertical stem with cross bars, surrounded by white lines on a red background. It is also framed by white lines and neatly executed, so that the white linear pattern dominates. The same ornament exists also on the two extraordinary posts from the Queensland Museum, E4521 (Plate I (a)) and E4519, where it decorates the middle axle, forming the backbone, so to speak, of these carvings. Here the ornament shows the same colours, but it is not so well done as the ones on the much more sophisticated figures from the British Museum. In the same sketchy way this ornament is also seen on an open-work board, E768, from Tabar Island. Here it forms part of the painted decoration of a pig-head and is also applied to vertical bands beside the central figure of an owl. It is not framed but painted in parallel rows in alternative colours of red and black. The same ornament appears also on post E3321, on the flanks of the large red fish on top of the owl-faced head, and this post, too, originates from Tabar Island. On this evidence it seems certain that this cross-bar ornament is, so to say, the signature of one of the most important 11 See H. Spiegel, 1967, pp. 65, on Chevron patterns from the Ceremonial paddles from Buka</page><page sequence="6">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 199 Tabax carvers. He might also be the creator of the two extraordinary posts from the Queensland Museum, but I am not sure, however, that the two figures from the British Museum were made by the same man. All these figures were collected before 1890. Next is a group of ornaments which are more frequently executed in bas-relief and open-work carving than in painting. I think that these imitate naturalistic branches and leaves in a stylized geometric way, to fit into a given framework, such as is seen on earpieces and on side panels on memorial boards. As the memorial boards often show birds as the main subject, the ornament may be a representation of their natural environment. As mentioned previously, ornaments play a more important role than humans and animals, as whole side panels are filled with them, whilst the representation of figures and animals is restricted to the centre part (Figure 1, 5, 6). These floral ornaments are mostly presented the same way ; there is always a middle stem or ridge from which symmetrical pointed leaves emanate in a rather geometrical manner. Sometimes the leaves are more pointed, as in the earpieces on mask E547 and E570, where they might imitate palm leaves, or they might only adorn one side of the stem, while the other side of this stem is filled with dînèrent shapes (board E772). This is the case when the ornament is meant to fill the given space of side panels on memorial boards such as E31179, or when used to fill any given space, like the fins of the large carved fish, E28777, where it also occurs. G. Peekel (1929 : 1027), describing such a fish, calls it the " Moonfish ", and describes the fins as symbolizing the light emanating from the moon. He also sees the symbol of light in earpieces. How far he is right in this assumption, I don't know, but it seems to be a fact that the memorial boards, with the side-panels filled with sun and moon symbols, are certainly connected with the cult of these celestial bodies, and they too, often show the floral ornaments in addition (Figure 1, 8, 9, 11). As painted ornament or in bas-relief and painted, the branch-like ornament is given on the woman post figure 84-7-28-2, Plate I (c), and in bas-relief on the breast of the woman giving birth, from the Australian Museum, E597. In both cases it consists of two curved branches emanating between the breasts and pointing towards the shoulders, showing a white circle (kap kap ?) in the resulting space between the branches. Similar painted borders are seen on the front of spirit houses in Ulapur, North Maprik (Gardi and Bühler, 1958 : 105-7). There exist also some central ornaments which might have a floral origin, but it is hard to decide whether in these cases it is a derivation from an eye ornament, so frequently used, or whether a flower might have inspired the artist. Probably both sources have influenced the creators of such motifs. There is a good survey of these motifs in A. B. Meyer (1900, Taf. XIII, with text on p. 31). He seen the eye motif further developed to independent forms and also the derivations from floral origins. I would add to this that a symbolic meaning as well is attached to centric motifs and that the four- or six-petalled flower on boards connected with the sun and moon cult is important in this respect (Fig. 1. 8, 9, 10), E24263, E1194, E4518,</page><page sequence="7">200 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS E4522, and board with geometric ornamentation (no number). The same motif with either four or six petals appears often on earpieces, mostly painted white (masks E569, E564, A14323 and Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. II/3, from Fisher Island). Star-like motifs with 7-10 points occur on the bodies of birds forming parts of carvings from Ulapur, North Maprik (see Gardi and Bühler, 1958 : 126-138). As a mere decoration, the motif appears arranged in rows of small four-petalled oblong flowers on board E768 and as a single motif on the forehead and cheeks of masks and figures (Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. II/2 and Taf. XI/5.) Figures and boards from Cape Sass (N.E. Coast of New Ireland) frequently show rows of small white circles on a dark background (Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XI/3 and 6, and Taf. XIV/3), whilst small white dots as fillwork may point to Simberi Islands (Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XIV/i and J. Guiart, 1963 : Fig. 284). Whilst we could see many connections with New Guinea in posts and figures (Maprik, Middle Sepik, E61937, E49750) there exist hardly any with Papua. There are, however, some connections in the field of ornaments : the ornamental branches that we saw in open-work on bird memorial boards and earpieces and painted on female figures, occur almost in identical shape on so-called " Hutmasken ", i.e. hat masks made from bark cloth from the Gulf of Papua district (see Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. ΧΑ/3) where from a red middle ridge black palm-leaf-like shapes emanate in a symmetrical pattern on a white ground. There is also the same way of surrounding the design with white lines as we saw it on the ornaments with the cross-bars on the figures of the British Museum 28-2 and 28-9, and on the Queensland Museum posts, E4521 and E4519. Colours Colours are predominantly red, black and white, and each of these colours might serve as background colour, thus giving the object its dominating colour effect, but yellow and blue do occur occasionally. Red is used as background colour of the large post E3321, and black for the more delicately carved post E518, E521. White is predominant with Uli figures, especially on the faces, and yellow fibres give the crested helmet masks a lighter appearance. Yellow, according to C. A. Schmitz (1962 : 17), is the colour of cultic cannibalism. A little blue and yellow are sometimes also used on these masks, and blue is seen on the delicate memorial board from the Queensland Museum, E4518, and on the body of the man in the crab mouth on memorial board E31179. Snakes are invariably represented in black or in black and white segments. Birds on boards are predominantly red and so are the large carved fishes. Birds on earpieces show white tail feathers with a black or red head (E569, E564). Yellow or white is used for the big tusks on fish and pig heads. To conclude the chapter on ornaments, it is well to say that painted ornaments play a definite part in the art production of New Ireland, whilst carved ornaments are part of the carvings, like the side-panel of memorial boards filled with</page><page sequence="8">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 201 ornaments, or ear- and nosepieces of masks and post figures. Carved ornaments are an integral part of figure composition in most cases. In some cases the carved figure, or the pig- or fish-heads, are so hidden behind a network of ornamental tendrils, birds and fishes, that these features which are, after all, the purpose (content) of the carvings, are difficult to recognize, e.g. on the tall posts E766 and E767 and E3333 from Tabar Island. Curvilinear as well as rectilinear ornaments are used, also framing and borders, but the lack of concentric patterns and spirals is remarkable. Colours and shapes are the most important factors in the appearance of New Ireland art, and painted ornaments are often used to dehumanize the anthropomorph features and to fill empty spaces or to imitate actual decorations, such as belts, fore- head bands, foot- and arm-rings and kap-kaps. Colours are used to emphasize darkness and light in a symbolic sense. 7. Summary of Part I In masks, posts and Uli figures, human and anthropomorph features have naturally taken the most important place in representation. However, we see that on boards and bas-reliefs the animal world takes over, and humans and spirits play a minor part, although they are not entirely omitted. To summarize the first part one could say that, with all the variety of shapes and forms of anthropomorph features, four types can be identified as the most important : 1. The aggressive, animal-like open-work face without the chin of the helmet masks which we often find on the figures of posts, with and without the helmet. These - to my mind - mean to represent the spirits of the dead, or evil spirits. It is characteristic for them to show all the attributes connected with supernatural beings, such as snakes, birds and fishes, forming a kind of network around the body and which at times are hardly visible behind all the by-work, 84 -7-28 «2-84 -7-28 -4 (Plate I (c)). They also show big boar-tusks, large teeth, sometimes a lolling tongue, and vivid ornaments painted all over the surface. Hair is represented in various ways of all sorts of material. 2. The second type of face is characterized by the mask-like expression of the owl- or t'ao-t'ieh face, described before. It carries mostly ear-, nose- and mouth- pieces, and is the least human and the most fantatsic of the four types. Used on masks or posts and peg-based figures, it also shows the abovementioned characteristic attributes, and the head is often surmounted by a special type of horns or ears (E563 and E3484). A small or very wide mouth, no chin, and eyes set in diagonally into the square space representing one-half of the face, divided by a median ridge from the other half, are also characteristic for this type. Large circular or peg-eyes are common for owl-mask faces too. 3. The third type is the most human-like face, the least distorted, found on the complicated maina masks, the Dresden boat figures and on the post figure E3327,</page><page sequence="9">202 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS and on most of the figures which I consider to be altogether human (as E582 and E583 and E600). Also the woman giving birth, E597, and some of the over- modelled faces like the drummer, 1927, 10*189 from the British Museum, and others These faces are carved from solid wood, mostly painted dark-brown or black, they sometimes show over-modelled features, such as lips or noses formed from beeswax or resin. The hair-do consists mostly of a rattan frame covered with fibres, or the head is covered with human hair, twisted fibres, sponge material and the like (see Dr. Pubi. XIII, Taf. Χ/3, 4). The eyes are mostly deep-set under a straight forehead- line, often decorated with a painted forehead-band, in imitation of the one worn by the natives, and the eyes consist almost exclusively of turbo-shell covers and are set in a white ground, which gives them a very vivid and rather natural appearance. Noses are mostly wide and curved, with distinct nostrils. The mouth is mostly wide, showing teeth, or more naturalistic, as with the drummer from the British Museum or the head mentioned above from the Dr. Pubi. XIII, Taf. X/3. Ears are always represented as ending in a loop. Heads with faces of regular, rather naturalistic, features, carved from solid wood, are also seen on the human figures on boards. These are mostly represented with over-large heads, carved separately and provided with a peg to be fitted into a hole on the body. They mostly show very rigid features, a straight forehead-line with eyes as half-circles underneath, very little chin, wide noses and a mouth full of teeth. The hair-do varies greatly, sometimes little sticks are used, sometimes fibres of different colours, and some of the heads show the crested hair-do of the helmet masks, carved in wood. Masks E548, E547 also show more human features. 4. The fourth type of face is the face of the Uli figures, discussed previously. There are hardly any variations in this type, only in the way they are painted and in some other, less significant, details concerning mouths, teeth or ears. I would like to mention another type of face, namely, the very small heads on carved boards and made from resin or beeswax of a dark colour. They are often shown in a peculiar way, namely, raised in a right angle from the neck, facing upwards. Examples in the Queensland Museum, E4518, and in the National Gallery of Victoria. Similar heads are also found on shields from New Guinea. I might also mention five faces here that do not fit into any of the four categories, but are much simpler. They are E25499, purchased in 1869, a mask of extraordinary expression, mask E548 and A18924, and a figure E3481. It is possible that they represent earlier types. Most figures show a proportioned neck ; shoulders are mostly separated from the body by ornaments and form a distinctive part. The bodies - as a rule - are given in a naturalistic way with short, slightly bent legs and feet with indications of toes. Arms are mostly rendered too long or too thin, but with well-executed hands and fingers, sometimes showing a very long thumb. The position of the arms depends on the design ; the hands mostly hold on to some rod or tendrils or fish or birds in front of the abdomen in a symmetrical composition. But there are exceptions,</page><page sequence="10">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 203 like the woman on the fish-head, holding her breasts, or asymmetric compositions like the woman in E882, holding one breast in the right hand and helping the child emerge from her womb with her left hand. Other asymmetric compositions are shown in the Dresden Boat figures, where each of the four figures holds a paddle in the extended right hand, and also in the four upright figures from the Stuttgart Boat, who extend their right arm, and a figure from the British Museum, 84 »7-28· 9. The drummer and a figure in the fish-mouth (Hamburg Museum) have their arms raised to their ears. The women's breasts are represented longish, pointed and projecting (see figure of rainmaker, E524, woman giving birth, woman with mask on top, E3330, woman riding on fish from Basel Museum in J. Guiart, 1963). The male organ is represented in a naturalistic way (E599, E583, Uli figure E1193). The rarely-occurring small anthropomorphic beings, represented in a crouching position, as on the remarkable post E4521 (Plate I (a)) from the Queensland Museum, and on post E1191, and on three almost identical posts from the Australian Museum, E1186/7, 8, and a similar being on a carved board, illustrated in Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XII/2 from Fisher (Simberi) Island, are quite exceptional, but they, too, seem to be typified. Art production in New Ireland is rather uniform in the three divisions we could establish : masks, figures and posts, and boards. They all show the same symbolic transformation of anthropomorphic beings, the same underlying formalistic principles, the same style elements but a different thematic content. A. Buehler (1958 : 76) says : " Handed down religious ideas and traditional expressive forms together give paintings (and carvings) their content, their motifs and their style ". A symmetric, static attitude is observed in most carvings and even in the asymmetric bird memorial boards, the eye of the bird is almost in the centre and lines, curves and colours are evently distributed. The main figure of the bird, how- ever, is carved in bas-relief, elevated from the background, and forms a wavy line, taking the eye of the observer from one end of the board to the other (see Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XIII/i, 2, 3 and A14220). Outlines follow the shape of the log from which the figures and posts are carved, and are only broken by ear-, nose- and mouthpieces, which are separately carved and inserted with various head-dresses, horns and feathers, especially on masks. Masks show a great variety of motifs connected with all kinds of materials and certainly give their makers the widest range of creative activity and an outlet for their nightmarish fantasy. Thus we can see that with all the freedom for detail and the tendency to use any material available, in principle neither the style nor the motifs have undergone any change in the (short) period of which we are conscious. It seems more probable that such rich centres of Malanggan carvings as the Simberi and Tabar Islands have produced more gifted artists, a greater sophistication and elegance in execution and more artistic compositions and designs than other more primitive local carvers. The only more unusual compositions are the Queensland Museum post E4521 and E4524, and the open-work board E24263, as far as I know. Of the more primitive</page><page sequence="11">204 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS types, I would consider the posts E3329-31 (Plate I (b)), showing female figures with masks on top of their heads, as outstanding. Conclusion To what extent does the art production of New Ireland reveal the character of its creators and their surroundings ? What do the carvings tell us of their past, traditions, myths and origin ? These are the problems to be discussed in this chapter. The northern part of New Ireland, where the Malanggan cult is practised, is a narrow homogeneous stretch of land. There is almost no " Hinterland " besides the narrow coastal plains, only a chain of hills running parallel to the coastline in the centre of the island. It is quite unlike New Guinea, where, with its highlands, steep mountain ridges, secluded valleys and river systems, refuge was provided for the tribes retreating before invading hordes. In the secluded settlements a great variety of art styles could develop, or survive, independent of each other. This was not the case in New Ireland, and, like the nature of its surroundings, the art production of northern New Ireland is homogeneous, in so far as no great differences in style can be found in carvings from the east or the west coast and the adjacent islands of Tabar and Simberi. It is more a question of technical skill and sophistication, so characteristic for the carvers originating in the last-mentioned island groups. The inhabitants are a very complex mixture of all the different Melanesian tribes, and their art production shows many features from various sources combined in their motifs and symbols. Although nature in New Ireland is bountiful and without dangerous volcanoes and dramatic landscapes, violent storms and tidal waves do occur, and tropical illnesses strike down people in the prime of life. Adrienne L. Käppier (1963 : 119, 125) says : " The violence of nature, sudden sickness, are forces that need appeasing and are mixed in native minds with supernatural ideas ". Death is one of the most mysterious aspects of life, and those peoples have made their peace with it. Through Malanggan a man not only gains prestige for himself serving his mortal life, but he is assured that his death will be properly mourned, his spirit will go to the world of the dead, and that he will maintain a connection with his people after his death. A. L. Käppier (1963: 120) sees "two dominant art styles in Melanesia: the expressionistic, where the appeal is to the emotions, which are heightened by exaggerated forms and colours, and the formalistic, where the appeal is to the eye because of a controlled form ". There is no doubt that New Ireland art belongs to the expressionistic style, and that there in is compressed the native artists' feelings of fear and danger, of magic and religious rituals, of his ideas of appeasement of nature's forces which he can't understand. The Malanggan carvings also show his relationship to death and the ancestors, whose help he hopes to secure. The important Malanggan celebrations comprise all these elements and also the passing on of traditions, the distribution of wealth and the acquisition of prestige. In several instances I could point out a relationship with the Maprik style of the region north of the middle Sepik, and what Bühler, (1958 : 122) says about the repre-</page><page sequence="12">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 205 sentation of birds and other animals in the carvings of the Maprik people is also valid for the New Ireland Malanggan carvings : " Totemistic concepts and the beliefs in supernatural beings in animal disguise form the foundation of the thematic ". Hornbills and parrots, frigate birds and a kind of kingfisher, duck-like birds and roosters turn up most frequently, either sitting on the head of the figure or mask, or as the main motifs on bird memorial boards. These birds seem to be connected in a mystical relationship as totem emblems to some of the clans. In some parts of the Bismarck Archipelago there exist only two totem groups, the one belonging to the fish-eagle, the other to the sea-eagle, but in the northern part of New Ireland and the Tabar and Simberi Islands several (at most ten) are known to exist. They include also the birds mentioned above as well as butterflies, flying foxes, marsupials and specific trees. The totem groups are further subdivided into clans, which are considered very closely interrelated, especially in the northern and middle part of New Ireland and the Tabar Islands, where the Malanggan cult is most developed. These clans are also related with a special part of the land, a bay, a reef or a part of the sea, where only the members of these specific clans are allowed to operate. Frequently the beliefs exist that in these places a specific animal lives, mostly a shark, a pig or a snake, which is described as Masalai. These Masalai animals are thought of as protectors of the members of the clan to which they belong, but hostile to others (A. Bühler, 1948 : pp. 164-167, and F. D. McCarthy, 1945 : 399). Frequently rem- nants of the cremated dead were buried at those Masalai places, either on land or sea. In Tabar and north New Ireland it is also believed that in the Masalai places a mysterious being dwells, a kind of second ego of each human being, the gas or gais. It can take any disguise and it dies with the human being to which it belongs. In connection with these beliefs and traditions it is understandable why, besides the various totem birds, sharks and various fishes, pigs (heads) and snakes are represented in Malanggan carvings. Could it be the fight between the protective animals and the hostile ones, the fight between the friendly and the evil spirits in disguise that is represented in the carvings ? The bird holding a shark-like fish with its claws and biting its fin, the whole group mounted in the mouth of a shark on top of an owl-face post and the projected tongue of the owl-face being attacked by another bird (E3321). Or on another post a bird is seen in front of the chest of a figure holding on to an upside-down bird attacking the head of another bird, being bitten by a shark-like fish. Birds being attacked by snakes (PL III (a), E1194, E49724) on tura memorial boards, snakes biting the chin of a masked female post figure (E3330). Birds attacking the eye-like centre on a board (E24263). A bird holding a black snake with its claws and beak (A14220). A rooster-like bird holding a black-and-white snake in its beak on an earpiece (E63150) and so on. Is it the fight between good and evil, light and dark, man against nature ? What about the figures, male and female, standing in or on a fish-head, or a whole fish ? (Plate I (c), 84-7- 28-2, 28-4, 28-9, 28-1.) Are they being protected or swallowed up ? There are, however, posts and figures where no such fights are given - as on the two similar posts from the Queensland Museum E4519, and on E4521 (Plate I (a)), o</page><page sequence="13">2o6 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS where the black snake, crossing the face, bites a fish at the base of the post as a minor detail only. Often the fight is only given in the network surrounding the main figures of a post as on the tall posts from the Australian Museum, E767, E766. Other posts where no attacking birds are given are represented in Dr. Pubi. X, Taf. XL/2, 4, 5, 6. Nor are these seen on figures E583, E582, E597, and others from the Australian Museum. There is another group of carvings without fighting animals. These are the boards which represent a human figure in the middle panel, and moon and sun symbols on the side panels (Fig. I, 6-11). . One explanation of the motif of the attacking birds, fishes and snakes forming a network around the anthropomorphic beings on posts and figures, as well as the figures with the totem birds on top of the head protecting its clan members, is that they represent man in his fight against everyday enemies and difficulties in his life on earth, whilst the boards with the displayed figure in the centre panel and the moon and sun symbols on the side panels express the relationship with the conflicting elements and the supernatural forces. To underline the significance of the middle figure a star design is given on both hands, the chest and on the crescent he is standing on, in the board from the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. On the similar, more crudely executed board, illustrated by T. Bodrogi (1959 : p. 22, and ill. 95), the central figure has a kap kap design on his chest. Carved moon and painted sun-eye motifs are seen on the side panels. On the interesting board from the Queensland Museum, E4518, the squatting, displayed figure with raised arms and backwards-tilted black resin head shows a vertical row of chevrons on his body, and chevrons are seen on the large black snakes forming the framework of the previously discussed boards. These central figures also show a kind of jacket or flying ribs, similar to those seen on the Uli figures, which are connected with the moon cult, and they, too, show the chevron pattern in a prominent way. In contrast to the tripartite celestial boards are those which show no division ; they are frieze-like and seem to have a similar symbolic meaning. They, too, are symmetrically composed and show a variety of motifs. E3326, seems to me to be a later misunderstood version of the celestial boards. In the centre it shows the large bust of a man holding a snake in each hand, and a naturalistic rooster fitted with real feathers and the snake in its beak, besides a man on each end of the board squatting or sitting in a crescent-shaped boat holding a paddle in his hands. That a boat is meant in this case and also on another board from the Vienna Völkerkunde Museum - and not the moon crescent - is indicated by the man standing on the crescent and also holding a paddle in his hands. There is another board in the Vienna V.K. Museum, where a man standing on a crescent holds on to the framework of the board, and a bird is seen on each side panel. Then we also have the boards from the Queensland University Museum (Fig. 1.6, 7, 10), where a man in the centre stands on a crescent- shape, holding on to a large black snake winding its way from one side of the board to the other, with two more personalities standing on it, and some eye or star motifs in between (E3349). Another board from the Queensland Museum (E4522) shows a</page><page sequence="14">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 207 bird attacking an eye-sun motif. The board's ends are filled with pig-heads and there are numerous other examples of boards showing a fish or pig-head at the ends (E3322, E24263) combining attacking birds and eye-sun motifs. What is the meaning of fish- or pig-heads on boards and posts in New Ireland imagery ? What is the meaning of birds and snakes ? Special sharks, pigs and snakes, besides totem birds, are thought of as protectors : Masalai. Are these the ones represented on posts and boards fighting the evil forces ? It is quite clear that a community of inhabitants of the coastal plains makes much use of fish as the most important source of food, and that therefore fish or fish-motifs are widely used in their art production. In a later period (about 6500 years ago) pigs were introduced in the Melanesian region and these have supplemented, and probably altered, the food situation. Besides many representations of naturalistically shaped fishes, there are also a great number of a-naturalistic, stylized representations and ornaments to be found, which are clearly abstractions of naturalistic fishes. There are, however, no stylizations of pig-heads and these are always represented in a natural way. This fact seems to me to indicate that fishes are the older motif. Fish-heads on boards and the large carved fishes are fitted with boar tusks which symbolize a combination of the most characteristic features of both species : their usefulness as a source of food and their protective powers in special cases, their fierceness in frightening the enemy (boar tusk are very highly estimated as ornaments, and are seen on a great number of masks and figures, either projecting from the mouth or fitted through the nose). They are meant to endow the wearer with the strength and courage of the boar and also to frighten the onlookers at the ceremonies. It seems also to be a fact that fish-heads and pig-heads are interchangeable, meaning that both have the same symbolic meaning and both evoke a similar reaction in the people they are meant to impress. How has this change come about - one could ask - and I think the answer lies in the myths of Melanesia. Myths are accounts of real happenings very far removed from the present but still lingering in the minds of the people, and kept alive by oral transmission - says Robert Graves. C. A. Schmitz (i960 : 273) reports and interprets a myth that is widely known all over Melanesia, from the Madang and Iatmuel district and the Sepik and Ramu Rivers to the Rai Coast, and from the Markham River district and Tami Islands to the Sulka, from the Bola and Nakanai districts of New Britain to the Admiralty Islands, Nissan, Buka and New Ireland. Only the details of the myth differ in the various parts of Melanesia where the myth is found ; the main features are always the same. Here is a short outline of the myth as C. A. Schmitz (i960 : 273) records it : at a very early period of primordeal times when heaven and earth were not clearly defined, and the gods lived in both spheres, the people on earth were subjected to severe troubles by a giant in the shape of a boar who killed and ate up all the people he could get hold of. So the people decided to leave the earth and they took to their boats, leaving behind one old woman. This</page><page sequence="15">2θ8 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS old woman lived hidden in a cave and eventually gave birth - in a magical way - to twin boys. They had to be very careful not to attract the attention of the giant ; they did not dare to light a fire as they were afraid the smoke might betray them, and they lived on vegetables and plants the old woman had planted. As the boys grew up they learned to fight, and, one day, seeking out the giant, killed him in a long protracted fight. The good news spread and the people who had fled came back and a great victory celebration took place. The body of the giant was cut up and eaten by the people, together with lots of pig meat. The boys got married and their wives gave birth to daughters only, who became the forebears of the matnlinear clans. In some of the myths the giant is described as a monster with large claws and boar tusks, as the son of a pig, the lord of pigs, the lord of the hunters, the lord of the sky. From all this it is clear that he belonged to the male deities who were thought to inhabit heaven, whilst the old woman, planting vegetables and giving birth in a miraculous way to twin boys, is the Earth Mother, the goddess of fertility, who taught her sons to cultivate the gardens. The boys - in some of the myths - are said to be a left-hander and a right-hander, which is also interesting because left- handedness is connected with the female principle and only by the combined efforts of the male and female principle could the fight be won. An interesting phase is indi- cated in the way the old woman gives birth to the twins ; never is a real father mentioned, but sometimes it is said that she had been pregnant and was therefore left behind. Sometimes it is mentioned that she copulated with a banana (Buka), with a bird (New Ireland), she cut her hand with a taro leaf and the boys emerged from the shed blood (Admiralty Islands). This seems to indicate the period when the role of the father was not known in procreation, the time of matriarchy. It is also significant that the boys' wives produced daughters only. Another very important factor is the victory celebration at which the body of the monster was eaten, together with masses of pig-meat, by the victors. This is in accordance with cultic cannibalism, which was widely spread in Melanesia, and the gradual replacement of the human victim by pig-meat. To me the myth suggests the victory of a matrilinear society over the invading harassing forces of a patrilinear hunter people, who might have brought the pig into the food-gathering and early planters' society inhabiting New Guinea and the adjacent islands. Traces of the matrilinear order are still to be found in New Ireland, where the children follow the totem of the mother, and the brothers of the wife and her father have to arrange for the Malanggan celebrations (Bühler, 1948 : 63-64). C. A. Schmitz (i960 : 407-425) suggests three periods in which immigration to the New Guiñean and the Melanesian regions took place : Culture A. when, at the end of the fourth glacial period, people from the north invaded on foot the Indonesian and New Guiñean region by the still existing land bridges. Not much is known about these peoples, but C. A. Schmitz could still find traces of them in the Huon Peninsula, and his publication "Wantoat" gives an account of his findings.</page><page sequence="16">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 209 However, one of the myths that Schmitz (1963 : 241) reports from Wentoat Valley, belonging to Culture A about the cassowary and the pigeon, exists in a different version also in New Ireland. (See R. Parkinson, 1907 : 695, and G. Peekel, 1927 : 26.) We are more concerned here with the following invasion by a maritime neolithic planters' culture, which is identical with Schmitz's " Culture Β ". These peoples came in two invading groups ; the older consisted of a dark-skinned Melanide people, the younger of Mongoloid, light-skinned ones. It seems that these two groups had a uniform basic religious structure and spoke a related language, now called the Pre-Austronesian language. The mixing of these two groups seems to have taken place on the north and east coast of New Guinea from where it spread to the south- eastern parts of Melanesia. The carriers of this culture were a seafaring people with matrilinear structure and cannibalistic tendencies. A third group of migrants also came from the north, by boats, and can be traced by their myths on the islands of Siassi and Tami and later on in the Markham River region, from where they spread to some parts of New Britain and New Ireland (Culture C). Schmitz distinguishes between myths concerned with cosmogony and anthro- pogany and myths explaining the origin of special plants and tools. In a homogeneous cultural region there is a connection between the three phases explaining the " Creation " - says Schmitz. The myth of the killing of the giant, or monster, is clearly connected with the creation of man, as the sons of the old woman marry the daughters of the returning people, and their offspring are the progenitors of the human race. But to make life on earth safe, the giant had to be killed and his body eaten by the victors. This seems to be the basis of cultic cannibalism. In order to survive, the enemy has to be killed and his body eaten and, through this re-enacting of the creation myth, the survival of the people is assured (Schmitz, 1961 : 15). We can now see the importance of the pig in Melanesian society. It was the attribute of the god of heaven, a symbol for his super-human powers. The giant's great boar tusks are worn by the victors in a symbolic gesture ; these symbols now belong to the man who had the courage and strength to kill the enemy. The vast rituals surrounding the cannibalistic act are significant for the important role of this drama of survival. It seems that some of the imagery of the Sepik River region and of New Ireland goes back to this phase of the mythical past. (See masks with boar tusks and figures standing on boars' heads : E569, E547, E4521, E3479). Bird Memorial Boards The role of men and women in the myths of Melanesia is also very interesting. A woman frequently gives birth to a son in the shape of a pig, or she can transform herself into a pig. Whilst men can do the same, they can also take on the disguise of a snake, a bird, a fish or a tree. In a dualistic cosmogony that followed a parti- linear system, the sun is always considered a male god, corresponding with C. A. Schmitz's " Culture C ", when another change took place in Melanesian society. A. Bühler (1962 : 76) also adopts Schmitz's concept of three different waves of</page><page sequence="17">210 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS migration with different concepts of cosmogonie and anthropogonic principles, as expressed in the myths of " Kilibob and Manub " which are found in New Guinea and New Ireland as well. The third migration consisted of a maritime planter figure, in which the tilling of the soil and fishing were equally important. Bühler continues : " The creation is frequently represented as a splendid epic, and is genealogically related to the historical past, especially to the process of settlement. In the beginning was the creative force, which is rarely conceived of as impersonal, but more frequently asa" tree of creation " (tree of life) or even as a personified supreme deity. The male principle and celestial power is represented by two hostile brothers, one of whom - inventive and enterprizing - creates the land from the sands of the primeval sea, while wandering about the face of the earth, either alone or with the help of companions. To him therefore belong the country-folk, birds, quadrupeds and especi- ally the dog ; he may appear in the disguise of a dog. He is also closely related to the sun, fire, boat-building, wood-carving and other cultural achievements. The elder brother, on the other hand, is typically conservative. Both figures are comple- mentary, polarités of the celestial male principle. Man issued forth from the union of the younger celestial brother with the terrestial woman, and it is she who created the most important cultivated plants, especially yams. She is often represented as a turtle and the elder brother as a fish. These myths, too, have been expressed in art and in the form of animals and human figures/' We have now heard of three different cultures connected with three consecutive waves of migration in New Ireland. The first does not concern us here as it seems to have left few traces in New Ireland carvings, except for the painted ornaments which show affinities with Papuan ornaments, but we can recognize traces of the second wave quite clearly. Schmitz (i960 : 424) says of the third wave (which is identical with his " Culture C ") : " While Culture Β certainly belongs to the belt of tropical planting cultures, this southern wave of Austronesian speaking peoples seems to belong to a northerly (perhaps circum polaris) religion. Typical parallels, especially of the cosmogonie concepts, are to be found in Northern Siberia, as well as in North America ". This reference to Siberia I consider most important, as, in my view, it explains another feature of New Ireland carvings, which cannot be ex- plained otherwise. On page 154 I mentioned the asymmetric carvings of bird memorial boards, which form a special group in New Ireland's art production. They all seem to be concerned with one theme only, the fight between a bird and a snake, i.e., the representation of heaven and earth, of light and dark, of good and evil. (We must remember that in the myth of Manub, the younger of the brothers is connected with birds, in that he often took the disguise of a bird, that he represents the celestial male principle, whilst the snake is connected with the earth and later on with evil spirits.) A similar theme is very often found in the Scytho-Siberian-Altai region, consisting of the famous motif of the fighting animals, " der Tierkampf ", expressed in the representatives of the region of their origin. This theme is found in Central Asia in innumerable examples, in all kinds of materials, such as wood, bronze, gold, leather, application and so forth. The animals range from lions and</page><page sequence="18">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 211 tigers fighting the bull, the reindeer or the stag, to griffins attacking a similar range of animals. All these scenes are composed asymmetrically (PL III (b), (c)) ; they are very often rendered in open-work and bas-relief, exactly as our bird boards are composed, and their ideaological content seems to be identical, too.12 The asymmetric composition of the New Ireland bird boards is the more surprising com- pared to otherwise strictly symmetric compositions, such as vertical posts and hori- zontal boards and friezes, almost to the last detail, whilst here we are confronted not only with an asymmetric design, but also the contours of the board show a different layout ; one half mostly follows the sweep of the bird's tail-feathers, whilst the other part is filled with the snake's body or floral ornaments (see J. Guiart, 1963 : Fig. 284, and Linton and Wingart, 1946 : p. 160). A displayed anthropomorphic or animal figure is often given at one end (E14220, Guiart, 1963 : 284). Other bird boards, which I call the " heraldic bird boards " (Fig. I.5), are symmetrically composed with a large a-naturalistic bird with snake in beak in the centre. Two symmetrical side-panels are filled with geometrical floral motifs. The bird is the exponent of the male heaven with the branches of the " tree of life " or " tree of creation ", another motif from Asia, on both sides (A. Bühler, 1963 : 76). The magnificent asymmetric bird board from the Basel Museum, illustrated by J. Guiart, 1963, Fig. 284 - mentioned above - also seems to depict the " tree of life " in the centre. It is not astonishing to find Siberian motifs and themes in Melanesian art ; the connecting link is Shang and Early Chou art, whose influence is noticeable in Indonesia and Malaysia as well as in Polynesia. R. von Heine-Geldern, 1966, in a Note on Relationship between the arts styles of the Maori and of Ancient China (pp. 5°~"52&gt; 53, 63, 65) points out the many instances where his so-called " Old Pacific Style ", i.e., O.P. is found in the island world of Sumatra, Borneo, the Sepik River area of New Guinea and New Ireland, and its relationship to Permian and Siberian bronzes. D. Fraser, in his study of " Early Chinese Art and the Pacific Basin ", 1967, also points out more specifically eleven motifs from the Shang and Chou period for which he could trace parallels in Sumatra, Borneo, the Sepik River, especially the Iatmul region, New Ireland and New Zealand, the New Caledonian Islands, Hawaii and Easter Island and Mexico. (We are not concerned here with the relations of these motifs with the American North-east Coast and the Mexican regions.) This study shows that the parallels are not isolated or sporadic instances, but that clusters of examples are to be found which also point out the route that carriers of this kind of art production have taken before reaching New Ireland. It is of interest to note that the Iatmul region, the Maprik and Middle Speik regions are the foremost recipients of this art style, and these are the ones to show parallels with New Ireland artefacts - as pointed out before. From the list of eleven motifs given by D. Fraser, the numbers 1, 4, 9, 10 interest us most : 1. Long Tongue Motif, which we can see on so many masks and posts. «K. Jettmar: 1966.</page><page sequence="19">212 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MANALGGAN CARVINGS 4. The Monster Mask Headgear, seen on the post figures (PI. I (b), E3329, E3330, E3331). 9. Displayed Flanked Figures, seen on memorial board from Queensland Museum, E4518, and others (Fig. I.3, 7, 11). 10. Sisiutl Motif refers to an image of two diverging profile monster-heads, joined together by a straight (or curved) member, in the centre of which a fontral monster face or displayed figure appears. D. Fraser, in his excellent study of " The Heraldic Woman ", 1966, has traced the motif of the displayed, flanked figure (Point 9) quite clearly in New Ireland and also point 10, the Sisiutl motif (Fig. I.4, pl. II (b)), and most of the boards ending in fish- or pig-heads). I add to this list the t'ao-t'ieh proper, the monster face in two parts, jointed together by a median ridge, which has its parallel in the New Ireland " owl-masks " and for which I could not find any explanation previously, but in this connection seems to fit in perfectly. All this is formidable evidence, which to my mind leaves no doubt about the origin of the different motifs in New Ireland art, and also explains the great variety in shapes, forms and content of New Ireland art. This island is only very small com- pared with other art centres (and Malanggan art exists only in the northern and middle part of the island and in the adjacent islands of Tabar and Simberi), and it seems quite improbable that this small community should have produced such a rich and complex output on its own account. Coastal districts and river estuaries mostly have the richer output of artefacts, due to influences from outside and contacts with different ethnic groups. We now come to the discussion of the last remaining group of boards, those showing sun and moon symbols and often a (displayed) figure in the middle panel. D. Fraser (1965 : 469) says, " Traits in any given culture are not all of the same place or age of origin ". This is also very true of New Ireland art, in which we can see the layers of three different cultural strata so far. We will now deal with artefacts which belong to a trend much more recent than the ones previously discussed ; as a matter of fact, if we are to believe G. Peekel, a missionary who lived in New Ireland for 27 years at the beginning of this century, were still in existence in the islands, only superseded by ancestor worship and memorial (Malanggan) cult. It is the sun and moon cult which is, according to Peekel, the main thematic source of the impersonal Malanggan carvings, namely of the boards, which I call the " celestials ". The myths connected with the sun and moon cult belong to a more sophisticated society, one no longer preoccupied with problems of origin and cosmogony, but well established in a patrilinear order, where male and female members of the community had their traditional place. As said before, whilst posts and boards had as content man's relationship to the powers connected with his earthly life, the boards with sun and moon symbols show his relationship to the celestial bodies : the sun, the moon, the stars. In this connection it is very interesting to look up the myth of Lunganga</page><page sequence="20">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS. PLATE III (a) Board with snake biting bird, E1194. Australian Museum. (b) Plaque with fighting animals. Eremitage, Leningrad. (c) Wolf fighting with snake. Eremitage, Leningrad.</page><page sequence="21">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 213 which A. Kraemer (1925 : 42) and G. Peekel (1926 : 818) report from Lamakot, a village on the north-east coast of New Ireland : a giant pig, called Lunganga, killed many inhabitants from the hillside villages on the west coast of New Ireland. It then crossed to the east coast to the villages of Hamba and Lasu, killing many people there. Afterwards he went to the south, following the coast line, and later to the north again. The people fled in terror to Tabar, and only a crippled woman was left behind on the Isle of Jenusa where she lived in a cave on the beach. One day a bird, Sili, sat on her lap and she became pregnant and in a short while gave birth to twin boys, who quickly grew up. Lunganga still ran up and down the coast from south to north, followed by the dog, Bumelemele. In Panagunda the dog overtook the pig which turned and ran back northwards to Lasu again where the twins stood waiting for it. They fought the pig and killed it and all the people came back from Tabar.13 The two victorious boys, however, left Lasu and wandered by a subterranean passageway to Lemau on the west coast. Well, this story is not new ; it is the old story of the Lord of the Pigs being killed by the twins, born in a magical way to the old woman left behind when all the in- habitants had fled in terror of the monster. But this time it is interpreted by G. Peekel as the myth of the Full Moon causing the stars (the people) to disappear from the sky when the moon is at the zenith. The stars disappear, in the direction from west to east, towards Tabar. When Lunganga is killed the moon disappears ; it is the time of the New Moon and the stars, the inhabitants, return when the sky is dark. This interpretation has been challenged, especially by C. A. Schmitz and also Peekel's further preoccupation with the moon cult, which the latter sees repre- sented in the memorial boards and many of the human figures. More research is needed to clarify the position but I doubt whether this is still possible under the present circumstances of progressive destruction of the original setup. A fact is that numerous figures show sun and moon symbols, and the Uli figures from the hill- sides of the middle part of New Ireland were definitely connected with this cult. (In this region, large sun symbols made from rattan and barkcloth were still found at the beginning of this century, and a very fine example is preserved in the Linden Museum in Stuttgart.) Linton and Wingert (1946 : 163) also report : " New Ireland Malanggans commemorated mythological ancestors such as the sun and the moon, long-dead relatives and the recent dead who were the immediate reason for the ceremony. Innumerable sun and moon symbols occur on all the objects. The moon is symbolized by a boar's head or tusks, by snake, fish and bird forms, by clam shells and by white striations about the eyes of a figure ; the sun, by the head of a bird and by ray discs, while a representation of the circular breast ornament (kap kap) was a symbol of the sun in some areas and the moon in others." There is another interesting aspect in interpreting the moon crescent so frequently seen on memorial boards. It appears sometimes as a boat with a human being standing in it, carrying a paddle in his hands, so that there can be no doubt as to its 18 A similar story is told by H. Powdermaker, 1933, from Lesu.</page><page sequence="22">214 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS identity when the crescent appears again in other examples. This is the case with two small boards from the Vienna Völkerkunde Museum, where in one case the middle panel is filled with a displayed human being squatting on a crescent, and a bird on each side panel, and the other board representing a human figure holding a paddle and standing in a crescent-shaped boat with the side panels filled with geometric ornaments. In the same way, on a board from the Australian Museum, E3326 (PL II (b) and Fig. I, 6, 7), we find the bust of a man holding a snake in each hand, flanked on each side by a rooster and a figure with paddle in hands, squatting in a crescent-shaped boat.14 The transcendental meaning in these memorial boards, however, might be the idea of transforming the moon crescent into the boat carrying the soul of the dead to the land of his ancestors. The disappearance of the moon after being reduced to a crescent and its reappearance in the sky has always been linked with death and rebirth. This underlying idea might also apply to the Dresden and Stuttgart boats, which, to my mind, are not only the memorial carvings to commemorate the event of the fishermen's death, but also of the soul-boat returning the dead to the mythical place of their origin. The idea of the soul-boat is a very widely spread and ancient one ; the same idea is expressed to prominently in the decoration of the Dong-son drums, featuring the funeral procession of decorated boats, plumed warriors and dancers. The influence of the Dong-son culture is quite prominent in New Guinea, but does not seem to have reached New Ireland in the field of decoration. The idea of the boat burial, however, is known all over the northern part of Melanesia and the central districts of New Guinea.15 Ceremonial Boats In the Asmat region of West-Irian, we find boat presentations on the bis poles, erected in honour of the victims of violent death, and also the uramun. The latter is a boat-shaped decoration from a men's house in Manowee, now in the Tropen Institut in Amsterdam (inv. No. 2316/59) and another ceremonial prow from Komor, Asmat region, now in the collection of the Museum v. Land-en Volkerehunde, Rotterdam (inv. No. 48040). Both are slim, long carvings (181 cm. and 256 cm. respectively), representing boats, richly decorated in open-work in the typical style of that district and filled with queer figures. The smaller boat from Manowee contains two figures with heads bent forward and arms holding on to the planks of the boat and insect-like bodies. The larger boat shows four pairs of such figures and two single figures on the bow. Another boat shows bird-like creatures in the same position. The meaning of these carvings is not clear, as very little is known about the Asmat people. S. Koijman, however, writes in his introduction to the catalogue of the Exhibition of Papuan Art in the RIJKS-Museum in Amsterdam, in June-September, 1966, on 14 See also my article in Mankind, Vol. 6, No. 10, 1967 : 510, on the symbolic meaning of the crescent and: Soul-boats in Melanesia, A.P.A.O., 1971. 16 H. Spiegel, 1971 : 34.</page><page sequence="23">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 215 p. 54 : " In this watery, swampy country in which it is only possible to move about over rivers and water arms, the boat is an indispensable element, not only in daily life, but also in rituals. The " bis " pole is in essence a boat. One of the ceremonial objects with a pronounced boat-form is the spirit canoe or " uramun " - many metres long, with prow and stern decorated like those of the great war-canoes. The sitting figures in the boat, all in the attitude of great tension, represent bird-like beings ; there are also " uramun " with rows of forward-crouching human figures. Like those on the bis poles, these figures represent the spirits of men and women who met a violent death (in head-hunting mostly). In a ritual in which the uramun plays the central role, the living take leave of these spirits of the dead. Again like the " bis ", the " uramun " is also associated with the renewal of life as well as death. They are indispensable attributes of the initiation of boys ". In some spirit boats we find turtle-like creatures and it is explained that turtles are a symbol of fertility on account of the great amount of eggs they produce.16 From West-Irian comes also a crescent-shaped carving with a stylized human being standing on it with legs apart (illustrated by Linton and Wingert (1946 : p. 135) from Dorei Bay, Dutch New Guinea) subtitled " Carving Representing the Moon ". This example will take us back to my previously expressed idea that the boat has some connection not only with death, but also with the moon, as we could see in the New Ireland memorial boards. Further to the east of New Guinea, in the Sepik region, many more carvings of this kind are found. The Queensland University collection possesses a carving from a men's house, boat-shaped, with a crouching duck-like bird on prow and stern, and six triangular points, decorated with an eye motif (see H. Spiegel, 1971 : ill. Fig. I.5, 7164). This example probably comes from the Middle Sepik. Two other examples of boat-shaped carvings ending in bird's heads and showing a human head or figure and triangular points on each side, also from the Sepik region, are illustrated by O. Reche (1913 : Taf. XXVI/3 and Fig. 1. 12). With the bird-head decoration on stern and bow, we are again reminded of the Dong- Son funeral barges.17 But the human head or whole figure, sometimes flanked by triangular points standing on the inside of the crescent-shaped base, also shows affinities to the controversial group of " Suspension Hooks ", which include such a wide variety of shapes. Some of these so-called " hooks " show the hook in shape of a wide crescent and, standing on it, a male or female figure of large size (H. Damm, 1964 : PI. II and VI). I wonder if this species of carvings has a closer relationship to the abovementioned group of crescent-shaped, boat-like funeral barges or moon representations than to hooks proper. And one should keep in mind that a close connection exists between head-hunting, hooks for the suspension of skulls and death, the funeral boat and the soul-boat carrying the spirits of the deceased to the land of the ancestors. 16 See also M. C. Rockefeller and A. H. Gerbrands : The Asmat of New Guinea, Museum of Primitive Art, New York, 1967. 17 A more recent example is seen on the so-called " Schiffstüchern , woven textiles from Kroe, South Sumatra, with representations of boats with stylized bird-heads, used in funeral rites. (See Basel Völkerkunde Museum : Indonesia, Fig. 2, and A. Steinmann, 1937.</page><page sequence="24">2i6 SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS I wish also to draw attention to the fact that there exists a close connection between food-bowls from the Asmat district (M. Rockefeller and A. A. Gerbrands, 1967, ill. p. 292/B, p. 293/E and G, and Cat. of Papuan Art, S. Koijman, 1966, ill. p. 29, and S. Koijman : Lake Sentani, 1959) and the very similar wooden bowl from Lake Sentani (see J. Guiart, 1964, ill. 131 and 132), not only in shape but also in the ornamentic, showing Dong-Son's curves. It is a known fact that on Lake Sentani bronze objects from Dong-Son had been found and that this district had been famous for its ornamentic, with its flat, band-like " S "-curves and spirals combined with stylized forms of praying mantis (see J. Guiart, 1964, ill. 136, design from a ritual tapa). Further to the east, in the Trobriand Islands, we find a similar flat decoration on dance-shields, canoe prows and lime spatulas. There is also the same kind of middle division on ornamented planes as in the Sentani decoration, consisting of a zig-zag band, also characteristic of New Guiñean carvings in general. Then we find the squatting figure, chin in hands, on lime spatulas, seen in profile, which we can so frequently see in Asmat art. From the Trobriand Islands also come a number of funeral boats, or ceremonial boats, filled with creatures of which it is hard to say whether they are humans or animals. The Australian Museum possesses a long narrow boat, E27468, 49 cm. long, with ten such figures in it, peg-based and inserted in special rimmed holes. From the Trobriand Islands to New Ireland is only a short distance, and it is there that we find, similar to Asmat, the very elaborate boats with four, respectively ten figures. The older one in the Dresden Museum shows the more simply constructed boat, with only a bird's head on each side - at the stern and bow - connected by a band and four very intricately carved anthropomorphic figures with paddles in hand, inserted in holes by means of pegs. The boat from the Linden Museum in Stuttgart, carved in 1902 in Parui village, shows a very richly ornamented hull, consisting on the one side of a human head in the centre, and on each side pairs of opposing birds attacking a vertical zig-zsg snake. The ends of the boats are carved in the shape of fish-heads with boar tusks, as we see them so frequently on ceremonial boards. The sitting figures are carved in one piece with the boat, like the figures in the Asmat boats, and the standing figures are inserted in holes by pegs The decorative frieze on the Stuttgart boat is very similar in style to friezes on " Männertüchern " (Men's scarves) from East Sumba (Indonesia), illustrated by A. Schmitz, (1964 : ill. 4), where on a woven material - used at funerals by men - three friezes of opposing pairs of stags, horses, and birds, respectively, are seen. (The birds are almost identical with the decorations on the Stuttgart boat, allowing for the difference in material and technique.) It could thus be shown that the links between Dong-Son bronze art and New Ireland carvings are closer in space and time than I had previously assumed, and that Indonesian influence, through the medium of textiles and bark-painting from the Dajaks (see A. Schmitz (1964 : ill. 3)) - which go back to that important exponent of a Chinese source (even to the framing ornaments on the " Schiffstüchern ") - and</page><page sequence="25">SOME ASPECTS OF NEW IRELAND MALANGGAN CARVINGS 217 show the direct decendence from Dong-Son drums - axe clearly established, not only in the underlying idea of the soul-boat, but also in actual decoration, style and content. It should be mentioned that the Asmat boats as well as the Trobriand and New Ireland boats contain ten figures. That the idea of the soul-boat was well established in China is shown by the description of the funeral mound of the mighty Chinese Emperor, Shih Huang Ti, (255-206 b.c.) who built the Great Wall. Ac- cording to the ancient Chinese, the emperor had planned his Eternal Home himself, and it contained a huge relief map in bronze of Shih Huang Ti's empire. The great rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow, were also represented by channels twelve feet deep, filled with quicksilver. And a boat-shaped sarcophagus containing the body of the Emperor floated on one of these rivers. Other sources say that the boat- shaped sarcophagus floated on a quicksilver lake.18 In summing up, I cite Professor A. A. Gerbrands (1967 : p. 39), for what he said about Asmat art could equally well be applied to New Ireland Malanggan carvings : " The art of Asmat is like a picture-book in which the basic elements of Asmat thought and beliefs are depicted in signs and symbols." Unfortunately we cannot as yet read all of them, but I believe we can understand quite a number of them, giving us a picture of the evolution of Malanggan Ceremonial Carvings. With the help of " Comparative Art History and Diffusionism ", I could clearly demonstrate how these complex artefacts, with their wealth of motifs, have developed throughout the centuries by keeping up old traditions and assimilating new thoughts brought by consecutive waves of immigrants. Many motifs are still unexplained, as we only know about the most important immigrations, but minor groups of settlers, probably from the north and south, might have reached New Ireland in times unknown, and left their imprints on New Ireland's carvers, ever-ready to accept new ideas, linking them with most of the artistic centres of New Guinea and, further to the west, with ideas from China and Indonesia, and the different island groups of the Pacific. 18 As quoted by Leonard Cottrell : " The Tiger of Chin ", 1962 : 174, from W.
