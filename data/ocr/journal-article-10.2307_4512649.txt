The characteristics of ambient light specific to habitat and background determine which aspects of conspicuousness are maximized. Transmission noise is any alteration of the signal that causes equivocation in the receiver. Signals must be designed to maximize spectral reflectivity in translucent media (such as fog, mist, or turbid water) or optimize the spatial arrangement of sender and receiver in opaque media (such as vegetated hab- itats). The conflict between concealment (e.g., from predators) vs. conspicuousness (e.g., to mates) may be resolved by efficient timing, changing the background, and general orientation of the sender with respect to the receiver. The relationship between the referent, the optical signal and the information it carries is discussed in Chapter 8. Hailman analyzes optical signals by using semantics and the indexic, iconic and symbolic information they carry, syntactics and the relations of signals to each other, and pragmatics as the evolutionary consequences of the signaling process. He classifies the types of animal behavior (agonistic, reproductive, and cooperative) and attempts to define the signal-characteristics of each type. Optical Signals concludes with a return to the 4 classes of behavioral determinants and a review of the problems in analyzing optical signals that emerged from Hailman's liter- ature search. Students of animal behavior who wish to ascribe "cause" to observed social behavior of animals are urged to read this book. A good methodical analysis of animal behavior should involve rigorous consideration of the biotic and abiotic components of that animal's experience. Hailman provides us with a useful guide and reference for analyzing the characteristics of optical signals.-Lise A. Hanners. 82. Greenshanks. D. Nethersole-Thompson and M. Nethersole-Thompson. 1979. Buteo Books, Vermillon, South Dakota. 275p. $27.50.-Desmond and Maimie Nethersole- Thompson achieve a rare blend of poetry and natural history. Their opening chapters evoke the harsh splendor of the Scottish moors, the exquisite beauty of the Greenshanks (Tringa nebularia), the joy, excitement, and frustration inherent in field work. These chapters dwell on the emotional satisfaction that is the field biologist's greatest reward, a point rarely evident in the scientific literature and still less often conveyed by under- graduate texts. With chapter 5 the emphasis shifts into a more scientific vein, but throughout the book the Nethersole-Thompsons convey an intense joy in the Greenshanks and all that is associated with them. Chapter 5 emphasizes individual variability by relating anecdotes from Desmond's 45 y of watching Greenshanks. Variability is an important biological principal, but the em- phasis it receives throughout Greenshanks may be excessive. Generalizations about the species' behavior, ecology, and population dynamics are possible and many generalizations are drawn, but become lost in the ensuing discussion of exceptions and anecdotes. More balance between generalization and anecdote is needed. Population dynamics are described in chapter 6 for the Sutherland and Spey Valley populations studied by the Nethersole-Thompsons and are described for the species gen- erally in chapter 17. The potential role of territory in population dynamics, discussed in chapters 6 and 8, is unclear. In some years there are floaters despite the fact that appar- ently suitable habitat is unoccupied. In other years floaters are absent and territorial males are unable to attract mates despite persistent display. The discussion of these matters is excellent and well supported with quantitative detail and anecdotes. The analysis of vocalizations (chap. 7) is simply outstanding. Vocalizations are named onomatopoetically and grouped functionally. The description of each vocalization is ac- companied by a sonogram that greatly enhances the verbal description. However there are some annoying problems, anthropomorphism beyond the bounds of poetic license, lack of quantitative detail on the use of the calls, and occasional loose reasoning such as when the authors suggest that the hen individually recognizes the cock merely because she looks up when he calls while flying overhead. She may, but she may look up in response to any sound overhead. Nonetheless the chapter contains much new material, is detailed, and most points are well documented.</page><page sequence="2">176] Recent Literature J. Field Ornithol. Spring 1981 Greenshanks use courting territories, where former mates may reunite, nesting ter- ritories, feeding territories on which the adults forage, and chick territories to which the chicks are led 24 h or less after hatching. Chapter 8 on territory is primarily descriptive and a fine source of data on territorial uses. The description of courtship in chapter 9 lacks quantitative detail and fails to separate action patterns. It is not among the informative chapters. Nest site selection, construction and structure of the nest are discussed in detail. Sites are remarkably consistent with a hen often choosing precisely the same nest site in suc- cessive years. Even different hens on the same territory in different years often chose the exact same nest site! The cock guards the hen while she lays the first egg but is less solicitous with each succeeding egg of the 3-4 egg clutch. The eggs of each hen have a characteristic and consistent color and pattern, although there is a tendency toward duller eggs with in- creasing age. The incubation pattern develops gradually during egg laying with the cock usually taking the night shift and the hen the day. Exchanges at the nest occur in the early morning and again in the early evening. From initial cracking of the shell to emergence of the chick there may be as much as 172 h. I confess to skepticism, as that time period constitutes about 30% of the incubation period. Prior to hatching, the chicks interact vocally with each other and the parents, an observation that offers exciting possibilities for ontogenetic study. Excellent comparative data on eggshell removal are presented. As expected (Tinbergen et al., Behaviour 19:74-117, 1962; Burtt, Wilson Bull. 84:492, 1972), Greenshanks remove or eat the shells almost immediately after hatching. Parents guard the chicks for at least 25-31 d, the cock usually remaining with the chicks longer than the hen. Diet and foraging behavior are discussed in chapter 14 where there is an excellent dietary analysis based on regurgitated pellets. However, the chapter is qualitative in its approach, although it raises many possibilities for quantitative ecological study. Predation on Greenshanks is discussed in the following chapter which includes discussion of nest destruction by red deer and sheep. Chapter 16, by D. A. Ratcliffe, is an analysis of the Scottish breeding habitat of the Greenshank, both its present breeding habitat and probable changes in habitat occupancy since the last glaciation. The last chapter is a summary of the book and a plea for comparative work on the Greater Yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca). The appendices that follow are filled with detailed information. I found the discussion of ecto- and endoparasites the most exciting as the information is all too rarely found in ornithological works. The book is attractively illustrated with black-and-white drawings and color plates by Donald Watson in addition to some very fine photographs by a variety of photographers. The data tables are amassed at the end of the book, an editorial decision that I found extremely annoying as one had to refer back and forth during reading. Inexplicably some tables were labelled figures and included in the text. Despite these minor problems Des- mond and Maimie Nethersole-Thompson have produced a monumental study, elegantly written, that will be a source of inspiration and ideas for future field biologists. Greenshanks belongs on the same shelf with Lack's The Life of the Robin, within every ornithologist's easy reach.-Edward H. Burtt, Jr. 83. Migrations of Birds of Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, Gaviiformes-Cico- niiformes. V. A. Ostapenko (ed.). Nauka Press, Moscow. (In Russian)-The book opens with an overview of bird-banding in Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Balkan Peninsula. The remainder of the book deals with the migratory patterns, deduced from banding records, of Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes, Procellari- iformes, Pelecaniformes, and Ciconiiformes. The contributions of the many authors are organized by species within each order and by geographic region (e.g., Far East, USSR, Balkans) for species with multiple contributions. Although a fundamentally regional work, there is much general information on migration patterns and the literature citations reflect a high level of individual scholarship.-Edward H. Burtt, Jr.</page></plain_text>
