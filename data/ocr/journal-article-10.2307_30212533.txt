<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Michael Rossetti and the Shelley Renaissance By HARRIS CHEWNING HE Shelley renaissance of the eighteen-seventies is an occurrence well known to students of nineteenth-century literature. During that decade and the years following, Shelley scholars became intensely active and produced a flood of editions, biographies, and critical studies, clarifying the text, enlarging the canon, and extending the world's knowledge of the poet. Among these prolific Shelleyans a leading figure, whom present-day students tend unjustly to neglect, was William Michael Rossetti. Be- sides being a pioneer editor, he made substantial contributions to the biography and interpretation of the poet and stimulated the activity of other important Shelley scholars. By 1870, when he produced his first edition of Shelley, Rossetti had already become well known in the world of letters. As a member of the youthful Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood he had edited its journal, The Germ, in 185o, and later he had written art criticism for various periodicals. In 1866 he had courageously taken up the cudgels for Swin- burne in a little volume defending the much-denounced Poems and Ballads. And when the first British edition of Walt Whitman's poems appeared in 1868, Rossetti was its editor, stoutly affirming the greatness of the daring new American poet. From boyhood William Rossetti and his brother, the poet-painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, had been enthusiastic admirers of the poetry of Shelley. Recalling experiences of his own fifteenth year William wrote: "I regard the reading and re-reading of Shelley, which began in the summer of i 844, as an epoch in my life. I revelled in his glorious idealism; and got confirmed in those general tendencies of opinion, on matters of faith and polity, to which I was already drifting."1 1. W. M. Rossetti, Some Reminiscences of William Michael Rossetti (London, 19go6), I, 57-58--hereafter cited as Reminiscences.</page><page sequence="2">82 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL From time to time William continued to read Shelley's poetry, though his interest in it lagged somewhat in the eighteen-fifties when he was preoccupied with the Pre-Raphaelites and art reviewing. Then in 1861 William Bell Scott gave him a copy of one of Mrs. Shelley's editions of the poems, and Rossetti "gave them a diligent re-perusal, viewing them with less immature eyes." He made notes in the volume and became interested in problems of correct text.2 In the spring of i868 he published in Notes and Queries a series of articles pointing out the need for a re-editing of Mrs. Shelley's 1853 edition of the poems.3 Rossetti emphasized (page 302) that changes of text should be "limited to tracing out and rectifying errors committed by Shelley's printers, or here and there a hasty slip of his own pen- not anything that he advisedly wrote and let stand." A number of spe- cific emendations were proposed. These articles attracted the attention of J. Bertram Payne, of the firm of E. Moxon, Son, 8c Co., which then held the copyright to Shelley's works. In April Payne employed Rossetti to prepare a new edition of the poems, annotate them, and write a prefatory memoir of the poet.4 Rossetti set to work with great zest; in his diary he noted: "Of all lit- erary work, this is the very one I would have chosen for myself."5 In preparing to write the memoir he studied the published bio- graphical materials on Shelley, chief among which were the writings of Hogg, Lady Shelley, Trelawny, and Medwin. Rossetti sought to bring the existing information into better order and to add to it what new data he could find. At the same time he sought all available aid in establishing the text. A number of his literary friends came to his aid with suggestions and bits of material. The most distinguished of these helpers were Robert Browning, who gave him some information about Harriet's letters to Shelley," and Swinburne, who found for Rossetti a copy of Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson and gave him advice about emendations throughout Shelley's poems-advice which Rossetti did not completely heed, for he found Swinburne much more cautious than he about making conjectural changes.7 At this time Rossetti renewed his acquaintance with Captain Ed- ward John Trelawny, whom he had met in 1843. When Rossetti visited him in 1869 Trelawny responded generously by giving him verbally 2. Ruskin: Rossetti: Preraphaelitism, ed. W. M. Rossetti (London, 1899), p. 274. 3. Notes and Queries, 4th ser.

One of these was Mathilde Blind (he calls her "a wild Shelley enthusiast"), to whom Swinburne introduced him; Rossetti enjoyed talking over biographical points with her, and after his edition appeared she wrote an important review of it.lo Another new friend was Richard Garnett, an official in the British Museum, who in 1862 had published Relics of Shelley. His relationship with Rossetti was pleasant and non- competitive, and he made available for the edition some unpublished manuscripts, including parts of Charles the First, and other materials. He also obtained for Rossetti some information from documents in the possession of Sir Percy and Lady Shelley, with whom Garnett had long been on friendly terms but with whom Rossetti did not wish to deal directly lest he be obligated to comply with their wishes.1' The completed edition, in two volumes, was published early in January, 1870.12 It attracted a great deal of attention, for it was the first critical edition of Shelley that had ever appeared and its Memoir was a new biography of the poet. Mathilde Blind reviewed it in the West- minster Review,'3 and Professor Thomas S. Baynes of St. Andrews Uni- versity criticized it for the Edinburgh Review;'4 both of them pointed out defects but praised Rossetti's work as a whole. An old enemy of the Rossettis, Robert Buchanan, soon to become embroiled with them in the "Fleshly School" controversy, attacked William's edition viciously in the Athenaeum.'5 Swinburne, a close friend of William Rossetti, also wrote a critique (later published in his Essays and Studies) of the edi- 8.

Many of these are fragments and many are juvenilia; none are of major importance. Perhaps the most valu- able was the large part of Charles the First from the Shelley manuscript lent by Garnett. Except for Buchanan, who called the new material "abortive efforts," the critics recognized its value to students of Shelley's development. Miss Blind, however, said of Rossetti's inclusion of cer- tain fragments: "It is a pity he has thus rescued them from the oblivion they so richly deserve."7 Rossetti in his preface (I, xiii, xiv) stated his own view: much of the juvenile and fragmentary material was "poorish sort of stuff" if not "absolute and heinous rubbish," but "it interests me as being Shelley's, and ought in my opinion to interest everybody to whom the later developments of that astonishing mind are dear." In preparing his edition Rossetti collated Mrs. Shelley's text with the original printed texts of the poems, and in a few cases he was able to extend his collation to manuscript versions. His avowed policy (I, xvi) was "to follow the readings of the original editions, unless some strong presumption should arise that these readings are erroneous, and those of subsequent editions correct." When uncertain, he followed his own taste. He altered the original punctuation and indentation as he saw fit to achieve "correctness" and clarity. Notes at the backs of the volumes indicate all conjectural emenda- tions-"modifications of the text which rest on my own authority" (I, xvii)-and some (not all) alterations of original readings on authority of manuscripts or later readings; they do not show changes of original punctuation and spelling. Concerning his emendations he states that it has been his "clear duty and prerogative" to set right "absolutely wrong" grammar, rhym- ing, and meter (I, xv-xvi). The notes indicate that he sometimes also took it upon himself to correct "absolutely wrong" meaning or sense. Most of the grammatical emendations are made to obtain agree- ment. Rossetti is disturbed by Shelley's failure to use the -st ending in verbs after thou, and he often makes such changes as hath to hast and drew to drewst. To his credit, however, he does not touch "Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety" but leaves the "grammatical laxity" knew, lest he spoil "the sound of the lovely line" (II, 569). Rossetti makes only a few emendations for rhyme, though he sug- 16. A. C. Swinburne, "Notes on the Text of Shelley," in The Complete Works of Algernon Charles Swinburne, Bonchurch ed.

XXXVIII, 85.</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM MICHAEL ROSSETTI AND THE SHELLEY RENAISSANCE 85 gests others in his notes and expresses annoyance at Shelley's license in using identical rhymes and near-rhymes. The most daring of his emen- dations are his corrections of meter. He asserts that many of Shelley's metrical irregularities are due to carelessness and that an editor may restore the poet's intention. Rossetti therefore frequently regularizes a line by altering, adding, or deleting a word. For instance, in "A La- ment" the line "Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar" is shorter than the corresponding lines; therefore Rossetti inserts autumn after summer (II, 573). Of this piece of tampering Swinburne wrote: "Upon this incredible outrage I really dare not trust myself to comment."'s Rossetti's emendations for meaning are guesses, based upon the con- text, as to what the poet intended to write in certain passages which the editor finds unsatisfactory in sense. Some of these corrections are quite plausible. In the notes to Queen Mab one of Shelley's sentences reads: "Their degree of conviction must certainly be very strong: it cannot arise from conviction." Rossetti alters the second conviction to reason- ing (I, 473), and later editors, Dowden, Woodberry, and Hutchinson, have accepted this emendation as rectifying a misprint. In other cases, however, Rossetti becomes intolerably presumptuous, as when he changes unbodied joy in "To a Skylark" to embodied joy. This emenda- tion evoked not only the fury of Swinburne but also the protest of Pro- fessor Baynes, and surely multitudes of other readers who did not ex- press themselves in print must have been likewise annoyed. Contemporary critics took Rossetti severely to task for his high- handed tampering with the original texts. Swinburne, whose reaction has already been indicated, stated that "the very slightest change of reading ... ought never to be offered without necessity" and that "there is no man living . .. who might be trusted to correct the meter of Shel- ley."'s Buchanan summed up Rossetti's corrections as "untrustworthy." Miss Blind, who had obtained access to certain manuscripts of Shelley which Rossetti had not seen, demonstrated that in those poems whose text could be checked by comparison Rossetti was usually right in emendations based on collation and wrong in those based on conjecture. Of the more scientific and conservative editors who followed Ros- setti and produced more creditable texts than his, several have com- mented on the 1870 volumes. Harry Buxton Forman, whose edition appeared in 1876, speaks respectfully of Rossetti's position as a critic and feels obligated to annotate his own chief disageements with the 1870 text, but he shows throughout his work a distrust of Rossetti's emendations.2 Roger Ingpen, in the Julian edition of 1926-1930 (I, ix), 18.

In the preface to the Ox- ford edition of Shelley's poems (London, 1904) Thomas Hutchinson states succinctly (page vi) the essential fault of the 1870 text: "Mr. Ros- setti pushed revision beyond the bounds of prudence." Rossetti's text, then, was more provocative than meritorious. His Memoir of Shelley, however, occupying 150 pages at the beginning of the first volume of the 1870 edition, was a valuable contribution to biography. Among Victorian literary men Rossetti was peculiarly well fitted to write a life of Shelley. Like the poet, he was an ardent political liberal. He could view Shelley's moral conduct from a non-Victorian stand- point, for he was long accustomed to the Bohemian living of his brother Dante Gabriel. Further, William Rossetti was an openly avowed ag- nostic in religion and felt no need to apologize for Shelley's attitudes toward established creeds. And he had unbounded sympathy and ad- miration for the poetry of Shelley, whom he considered "the greatest English poet since Milton, or possibly since Shakespeare."21 Rossetti strove to present without bias the facts of Shelley's life. "I dont want to whitewash Shelley at all," he wrote to Garnett, "being perfectly content with him as he stands."22 He disliked including in- formation that might offend living relatives and associates of the poet, but he felt that truth was the first consideration. In a letter to William Allingham he said, "I think that to give the world a correct idea of the character of so great a man as Shelley is-if the two things clash-an object of greater moment than the feelings of worthy living persons."23 Rossetti's Memoir is a concise and orderly bringing-together of pre- viously published information about the poet, and it also contains the moderate amount of new data that Rossetti had been able to turn up. It is well documented, and, where evidence is lacking or dubious, Ros- setti calls attention to the difficulty. Often he indicates the grain of salt with which the assertions of earlier biographers must be taken. In dealing with the difficult episodes of the separation of Shelley and Harriet and of Harriet's suicide, he carefully excludes rumor or brands it as such and sums up the known facts (so far as they are at his disposal) without prejudice, presenting the actions of Shelley, Harriet, and Mary sympathetically, trying to show each person's point of view. As he comes in his narrative to the composition of each of Shelley's chief works, Rossetti briefly criticizes it. The latter part of the Memoir is loosely constructed of odds and ends-excerpts from Shelley's letters, anecdotes, critical estimates by various writers, a brief analysis of Shel- 21.

In general, the Memoir met with approval from the public. Brown- ing, who had aided Rossetti in his research, wrote in January 1870: "I have just been reading Shelley's 'Life' as Rossetti tells it, and when I think how utterly different was the fancy I had of him forty years ago from the facts as they front one to-day, I can only avoid despising my- self by remembering that I judged in pure ignorance and according to the testimony of untruthful friends."24 Swinburne, who had also helped Rossetti but had dealt severely with his emendations, said that the biog- rapher "has lightened the darkness that perplexed us at so many turns of a labyrinth which others had done their best to darken; he has de- livered all students from the bondage of Medwin and Hogg."25 A more unbiased critic, Baynes, commended the Memoir as a "clear and read- able narrative" written in "a spirit of candour and impartiality";26 and Miss Blind called it a more nearly complete biography of Shelley than any previous work. Buchanan accused Rossetti of inadequate informa- tion, poor style, and deliberate falsehood, but his hostile and prejudiced judgment represented only a small minority. The Memoir of Shelley, though superseded long ago by more de- tailed biographies based on materials not available to Rossetti, has con- tinued to be respected. Edward Dowden, who in 1886 published a two- volume biography of the poet, acknowledged in his preface the value to him of the earlier memoir. Roger Ingpen, editor of Shelley's letters and co-editor of the Julian edition of the poet's works, wrote in 1909 that Rossetti's Memoir was "packed with valuable criticism of the poet's life, and has for forty years remained an authority."27 The most dis- tinguished recent biographer of Shelley, Newman Ivey White, called Rossetti's work "valuable."28 And in 1950 Bennett Weaver, in a discus- sion of Shelley research up to that time, praised Rossetti's Memoir for its scrupulous truthfulness and pointed out its continuing usefulness to twentieth-century scholars.29 Besides presenting a text of Shelley's poetry and a biography of the poet, Rossetti included in the Memoir and the notes a considerable quantity of criticism, both of individual poems and of Shelley's work as a whole. He dismisses most of the juvenilia as "rubbish," though he admires Queen Mab for its declamatory fervor and sonorous blank 24. Letter of Browning, quoted by T. J.

The first of Shelley's poems that shows the poet's adult powers, Rossetti thinks, is Alastor, which he con- siders more mature than Keats's Endymion. He finds The Revolt of Islam to be rich in "gorgeous ideality" and "passionate rush of inven- tion" but not quite a great poem, for it lacks "consummate interest to the heart" (I, cii). Shelley "became a citizen of eternity," Rossetti be- lieves, with Julian and Maddalo, which, with its "perfect limpidity of mind and word," ranks (with Prometheus Unbound and The Cenci) as one of Shelley's three greatest long poems (I, cvii, cviii). At the summit of Shelley's achievement and of all modern English poetry Rossetti places Prometheus Unbound-"the ideal poem of per- petual and triumphant progression," which "embodies, in forms of truly ecstatic beauty, the dominant passion of the dominant intellects of the age" (I, cxxii). His admiration of The Cenci is almost as great; he calls it "the noblest English tragedy of modern times" (I, cxxii). He speaks of Epipsychidion as a "subtle and astonishing poem" but doubts "whether it is quite a justifiable sort of poem to write," since it is so intangible and enigmatic (I, cxxviii-cxxix). He ranks it below The Witch of Atlas, which he considers "consummate in imagination and workmanship" (I, cxxxi). Adonais is praised less warmly; it has a "won- derful flow of poetry" but has less "poetical invention" than Shelley's other great poems (I, cxxxii). Among the short poems, Rossetti accords first place to the "Ode to the West Wind" (I, cvii, note). In his comments upon the poet's work as a whole (I, cix), Rossetti stresses the range and variety of Shelley's powers and enumerates seven "lines of poetic faculty" of which he was a master; these (in Rossetti's terminology) are the ideal, the tragic, the poetic-familiar, the lyric, the grotesque, poetic translation, and the didactic-declamatory. Rossetti points out, however, that the poet lacks skill in sustained narrative and that in certain poems there is "a peccant element of unrealism, a slippery hold upon the human." The quality of Shelley that pleases Rossetti most is his idealism, especially its application to ideas of political and religious freedom and of potential humanitarian progress. The critic admires the poet's intel- lectual vigor and imaginative reach and enjoys searching out the mean- ing of such a difficult poem as Prometheus. But he objects when Shel- ley fails to make his thoughts communicable; even in Prometheus "supersubtleties of thought" are a blemish, and Epipsychidion is the less commendable because it is too puzzling and obscure (I, cxxii, note, and cxxix). Though his Victorian notions of correctness make him pro- test occasionally about Shelley's laxities in rhyme and meter, Rossetti is usually responsive to Shelley's lyrical power-which he thinks of as a</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM MICHAEL ROSSEFTTI AND THE SHELLEY RENAISSANCE 89 combination of emotional fervor and musical beauty-and his en- thusiasm is never greater than when he speaks of "the rolling river of great sound and lyrical rapture" and the "brimming and bubbling foun- tain of freshness and music" (I, cxxi, cxxviii). Whatever were the merits of Rossetti's 1870 edition of Shelley, it gave a great impetus to Shelley scholarship. It provoked the brilliant reviews by Miss Blind and Baynes, which contained important contri- butions to Shelley criticism and to knowledge of the poet's text. The controversies over Rossetti's emendations stimulated interest in the problems involved and prepared the way for better critical texts which were soon forthcoming, notably Forman's in 1876, 1882, and 1892, Dowden's in 1890, and Rossetti's own revision of 1878. The Memoir raised questions about Shelley's life which encouraged new research, of which Dowden's excellent biography of 1886 was one result. During the decade beginning in 1870o Rossetti worked busily at further Shelley studies. He developed new friends among fellow Shelleyans and persons who had first-hand information about the poet. His acquaintance with Dowden began in February 1870 when Dowden wrote him a letter about Whitman,30 and, as in the case of Garnett, the friendship of the two Shelley scholars resulted not in competition but in interchange of material and help. About 1876 Rossetti met H. Bux- ton Forman, who was bringing out his rival edition of Shelley; the two editors made an agreement, to which their publishers assented, that each could use any material copyrighted by the other.3' Other new acquaintances of Rossetti in this decade included Mrs. Hogg (formerly Jane Williams), whom he met through Trelawny in March 1871, and Jane Clairmont, whom he visited at Florence in June 1873.32 Various writings on Shelley came from Rossetti's pen during these years. In July 1870 Moxon published an unannotated one-volume edi- tion of Rossetti's Shelley, for which the editor wrote a condensation of his Memoir to serve as introduction. During the same year Rossetti dis- covered some documents concerning Shelley's political activities in 1812-1813, along with two uncollected works of the poet: a poem, "The Devil's Walk," and a "seditious" prose work, "Declaration of Rights." These findings were presented in the Fortnightly Review in January 1871.83 In other articles Rossetti discussed Shelley's interest in the Irish patriot Peter Finnerty34 and approved the theory that the Don Juan was rammed by another vessel.35 Also, having become known as an authority on Shelley, he reviewed a number of new books concerning the poet. 30.

On March 15, 1875, he spoke to a large audience at the Masonic Hall, Birmingham, and later he used the same material in lectures given at Newcastle-on-Tyne. These lectures, with the title "Shelley's Life and Writings," were published in the University Magazine of Dublin in 1878 (I, 138-155 and 262-277). They are written in a pleasant popular style. The first tells the story of the poet's life, and the second gives the lecturer's estimate of Shelley's poetry and discusses the poet's character and opinions. Rossetti's comments on individual poems are similar to his remarks in the Memoir, but his general appraisal of the poet is more clearly stated than before. The chief defects of Shelley's poetry he sums up as "sentiment running into sentimentalism; ideal excess, tenuity, and vagueness; indifference in most cases to the actualities of life, and to a definite, spirit-stirring exhibition of the passions; and want of firm, decisive narrative power." Turning to the poet's merits Rossetti says that "the most essential distinction of Shelley's poetry" is "Imagination combined with Speculation, and both taking the form of Beauty." He points out the poet's emotional sensitiveness, his re- sponse to the beauty of external nature, and his bringing into poetry "the ideas of the future" (pages 266-269). Shelley's work, Rossetti be- lieves, has in it "more that we can at once love and approve" than has the work of any other poet of recent times (page 272). The new Shelley material that he and others were bringing to light, as well as the stimulating criticism that his 1870 volumes had drawn forth, made Rossetti welcome an opportunity to prepare a revised edi- tion for Moxon. He was at work on it by 1876, devoting even greater care to the revision than to the original work. Early in 1878 the new edition, in three volumes and with larger and more readable type, was published."3 It contained a few additions to the poetical corpus; these included some pieces from Forman's edition and "The Devil's Walk," which Rossetti had discovered in 1870. The text of the 1878 edition shows many alterations of the 1870 text and is much more conservative, often reverting to readings ac- cepted before 1870. Rossetti says in his preface (I, xvi): "In the present re-issue, 1878, I have been still more chary of introducing conjectural emendations into the text; partly through my own augmenting sense of their riskiness, partly because critics of the edition of 187o (some of them deserving and receiving my high regard) have objected, in princi- ple or in detail, to various things which I then conceived myself to be justified in doing." He used the authoritative readings presented in Miss Blind's review to rectify errors of 1870 in the poems to which they 36.

The two conjectural emendations that had given most offense -embodied joy in "To a Skylark" and the insertion of autumn in "A Lament"-were both retracted. In some instances, however, Rossetti clung resolutely to his earlier emendations despite competent criticism; for example, W. WV. Skeat informed him that such a "grammatical" correction as thou drew to thou drewst was unnecessary since the ancestral Anglo-Saxon form did not have the -st ending in strong verbs, but Rossetti, replying that the proper nineteenth-century form was what he sought, kept his emendation (I, xv, note). By and large, how- ever, because of the additional knowledge and better judgment which Rossetti had acquired in eight years of further study, the revised text is a great improvement. A conspicuous change in the Memoir of the 1878 edition is the omission of any mention of the liaison of Jane Clairmont and Byron. In the 1870 edition (I, lxxviii, note) Rossetti had said: "Statements about Miss Clairmont ... are inserted in this memoir for two reasons- because they are a substantial part of Shelley's biography, and because they are already printed in more books than one, so that their suppres- sion here would serve no real purpose of delicate reticence." But Rossetti met Miss Clairmont in 1873, and when later she requested him to omit certain passages from the revised Memoir, he consented. The 1878 edition says in a note (I, 54): "The name of Miss Clairmont occurs in the sequel of this Memoir seldomer perhaps than some readers might expect. She is still living, and settled in Florence." When the Memoir was reprinted by the Shelley Society as a separate volume in 1886, after Miss Clairmont's death, Rossetti included in his preface (p. iv) this explanation: "Now that Miss Clairmont is dead-she died on 19 March 1879-it may be permissible to say that, in the first form of my Memoir of Shelley, 1870, I gave various details bearing upon the fact of her being the mother of Byron's natural daughter Allegra; but, when the second form of the Memoir was on the eve of publication in 1878, Miss Clairmont asked me to omit any such details. I at once complied." New information added to the 1878 Memoir includes some new data which had appeared in 1873 in D. F. MacCarthy's Shelley's Early Life, plus Rossetti's own findings which he had published in periodicals since 1870. It is not surprising that the 1878 edition received comparatively little attention in the reviews, for it was at least the fourth edition of Shelley within eight years. An anonymous reviewer in the Athenaeum (April 27, 1878) noted its superiority to the 1870 work and stated that he preferred it to Forman's volumes.

"Mr. Forman's," he said, "will be more ap- preciated by students and specialists, but Mr. Rossetti's by the general reader." Rossetti did not attempt a further revision of his edition after 1878, though he edited A donais as a separate volume in 1891. A project to which Rossetti devoted a great deal of attention be- tween 1872 and 1879 was his compilation of autobiographical writings of Shelley. He assembled "all the accessible letters of Shelley, . . . with all the passages in his poetry and prose which relate distinctly to him- self."38 To these materials, which Rossetti arranged in chronological order and annotated, he gave the title "Cor Cordium." Unfortunately he was never able to find a publisher for them, the main obstacle ap- parently being the copyright difficulties involved. The compilation was not without usefulness, however, for Dowden borrowed it while work- ing on his biography of Shelley and found it valuable.39 Of the several periodical articles which Rossetti published in the late seventies and the eighties, one of the most important was his review in 1885 of John Cordy Jeaffreson's The Real Shelley. This book, a clever debunking biography, had infuriated many Shelleyans, especially since it came out at a time when interest in the poet and admiration of his work were high. In a just and moderate criticism Rossetti states that Jeaffreson's aim was to "strip Shelley, and exhibit him to the astonished hero-worshipper as a very sorry manikin." Though acknowledging the author's merits of scholarship, clarity, and persuasiveness, the reviewer asserts that Jeaffreson has omitted or falsified essential facts in "tarring and feathering a supreme poet and an idealistic reformer, in a world where such personages are the reverse of plentiful."40 When the Shelley Society was founded in 1886 through the efforts of Dr. F. J. Furnivall, Rossetti was appointed "Chairman of Committee" and held that position (equivalent to presidency) until the society was dissolved in 1895. Thus he was a leader in the organization's activities to foster knowledge and appreciation of the poet and to publish useful Shelleyan materials. On December 15, 1886, he delivered to the society a lecture entitled "Shelley's Prometheus Unbound. A Study of its Meaning and Personages,"4' and on November 9, 1887, and January 11, 1888, he gave the two parts of a second lecture, "Shelley's Prometheus Unbound Considered as a Poem."42 These addresses form a continuous discussion and were published by the society in 1888. In 1869 Rossetti had remarked in his diary that "Prometheus is the 38. Reminiscences, II, 386. 39. Reminiscences, II, 387; Gohdes and Baum, pp. 113-114; Garnett, p. 8x. 4o. W. M.

However, they are not chiefly panegyri- cal but rather analytical and interpretive. He identifies Prometheus as "the Mind of Man," Asia as Nature, Demogorgon as Eternity, and Jupiter as "Fortune, or the Vicissitude of the World" and also "an anthropomorphic Deity" (pages 61-69). The allegory of the entire poem is then interpreted in detail (pages 139-14o) as the story of the human mind being freed from the conception of an anthropomorphic God and purging itself of hatred so that an ideal age of enlightenment and virtue may ensue. In analyzing Prometheus and showing the relationship among its parts Rossetti argues (pages 157-166) that Act IV is not an anticlimax but a superb "hymn of deliverance and progression" developing from the principles presented in Acts I-III. The poem as a whole, he finds, has a sublimity comparable to that of Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy. In reply to readers who consider Prometheus too shadowy and rhapsodic Rossetti says (pages 173-174) that to make it more severe and concentrated would "turn a clarion into a lullaby." The poem's "galaxy of beauties and splendours of ideal invention and suggestion" sprang from Shelley's unique powers and are perfectly suited to his subject. Because of their illumination of Prometheus as a vehicle of thought, Rossetti's lectures have become classic among criticisms of the poem. Later critics have praised them and found them useful. In 1924 Olwen Ward Campbell wrote: "The lectures on Prometheus delivered by W. M. Rossetti to the Shelley Society, develop a sound and thoughtful criticism of the play, though somewhat over-elaborate, and they are informed with a fine enthusiasm.""44 Floyd Stovall in 1931 referred to Rossetti's lectures as one of the two "best known and most available, perhaps most authoritative" of all interpretations of the poem.45 In Carlos Baker's recent interpretive work, Shelley's Major Poetry (Prince- ton, 1948), Rossetti is cited (page 1 12, note) as one of three chief earlier commentators on Prometheus. The lectures, then, are enough in them- selves to place Rossetti among the distinguished critics of Shelley. Among the other publications of the Shelley Society was a reprint of Rossetti's Memoir of Shelley, issued in 1886 as a separate volume with a "fresh preface" calling attention to new data correcting and amplifying the material in the 1878 version. A particularly successful piece of writing which Rossetti produced during the eighties was his essay "Shelley" for the Ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica." This article, which appeared in 1886, was 43. Rossetti Papers, p. 383. 44. Shelley and the Unromantics (New York, 1924), p. 203, note. 45. Desire and Restraint in Shelley (Dur- ham, N.

It is better written than these earlier works, being more fluent in style, better organized, and more mature in thought. It shows its author's mastery and assimilation of the Shelleyan knowledge with which he had been occupied for nearly twenty years, and it reveals the full ripening of his judgments on Shelley's poetry. There are no noteworthy innovations in biographical data, and the critical opinions expressed are in general like Rossetti's earlier ones, though some are more penetrating and more forcefully expressed in the new essay, as in the following passage (pages 793-794): "The Witch of Atlas (1820) is the most perfect among all Shelley's longer poems, though it is neither the deepest nor the most interesting. It may be rated as a pure exercise of roving imagination-guided, however, by an intense sense of beauty, and by the author's exceeding fineness of nature .. The 'witch' of this subtle and magical invention seems to represent that faculty which we term 'the fancy'; using this assumption as a clue, we find plenty of meaning in the poem, but necessarily it is a fanciful or volatile meaning." Rossetti's article has continued to be used in later editions of the Britannica. In the Eleventh edition it is reprinted without change ex- cept for the insertion of a few minor factual points and the bringing up-to-date of its bibliography. For the Fourteenth it was revised by Roger Ingpen, but it is still sufficiently Rossetti's work to be signed "W. M. R. and R. I." The last major task of Rossetti's Shelley scholarship was his editing of A donais for the Clarendon Press Series.47 His little volume, published in 1891, contains the text of the poem and materials for studying it- brief biographies of Shelley and Keats, an account of the composition of the poem, an exposition of its meaning, and translations of pertinent passages from Bion and Moschus. Rossetti's explication of the poem is meticulous, orderly, and clear. He praises its artistry and its thought, especially the denunciation of the critics, the stanzas about the moun- tain shepherds, and "the solemn and majestic conclusion." He does not, however, rank it as one of Shelley's greatest poems (page vii): "In point of absolute intrinsic beauty and achievement, and of the qualities most especially characteristic of its author, it is not superior, or indeed is but barely equal, to some of his other compositions. To take, for instance, two poems not very different in length from Adonais-The Witch of Atlas is more original, and Epipsychidion more abstract in ideal." The volume was well received by the public, so that in the following year the 47.

He did so, assisted by A. O. Prickard, a classical scholar of New College, Oxford, and the revised volume appeared in 1903. Rossetti's career as an active, publishing Shelley scholar extended over a period of thirty-five years-from his Notes and Queries articles on Shelley's text in 1868 to his revised edition of Adonais in 1903. Dur- ing those years he had perhaps contributed as much as any other one person to the enormous advance of Shelley scholarship that had taken place in England. His two critical editions of Shelley's poems are not now regarded as superior texts, nor do they deserve to be. Rossetti had a great reverence for Shelley's poetry and a sincere desire to restore its text to what the poet intended to let stand. But, in preparing his 1870 volume, he lacked much of the manuscript material that later came to light, and his cor- rection of punctuation, grammar, rhyme, meter, and sense of original readings-however well intentioned and ingenious it may have been- was unscientific and at times highhanded. His revision of 1878, with its more conservative text, shows his development in editorial judgment and ability to use new data and benefit by criticism, but it is still not reliable. Nevertheless, these editions have their place in the develop- ment of the Shelley text, for they launched the task of critical editing of the poet and their very blunders were a stimulus to later editors. To Shelley biography Rossetti contributed an orderly synthesizing of earlier materials and the addition of data from his own researches. His candid, yet sympathetic presentation of the poet gives his biographi- cal work a distinctive value. The three forms of his Memoir-those of 1870, 1878, and 1886-show a steady progression in accuracy and ful- ness as Rossetti learned more and more about Shelley's life, and the Encyclopaedia Britannica article of 1886 shows his biographical achieve- ment at its best. In his criticism of Shelley Rossetti performed both the evaluative and the interpretive functions of the critic. His preferences among the major works are of interest as the opinions of a devoted Shelley scholar, though they met with much disagreement in his time and would do so now. His choice of Prometheus Unbound as Shelley's masterpiece is a standard judgment; his relatively low regard for Adonais is not. His high ranking of Julian and Maddalo and The Witch of Atlas is con- troversial indeed. But the verdicts of a critic are less important than the principles behind them. Rossetti's appraisals of Shelley's poems are often expressed in terms of exuberant praise, but he cannot be dismissed as merely an impres- sionistic critic giving vent to his own subjective reactions. His critical passages show him seeking out specific qualities-good or bad-of the</page><page sequence="16">96 KEATS-SHELLEY JOURNAL poem at hand and basing his evaluation on these. And he maintained a good balance between considerations of form and considerations of content. As a critic of Shelley, Rossetti was most facile and effective when his attention was focussed upon the poet's ideas. His criticism is therefore most valuable when it is interpretive. He was an intelligent and pene- trating reader of the poems, and his expositions of their meaning are, as a rule, orderly, consistent, and enlightening. His lectures on Pro- metheus, his annotation of Adonais, and his briefer interpretive state- ments-such as those on The Witch of Atlas-are his most valuable pieces of Shelley criticism. It is unfortunate for later students of the poet that Rossetti did not undertake more such interpretive works. As a pioneer editor, a conscientious biographer, an illuminating critic, and a devoted ally of the other great Shelleyans of his time, Wil- liam Michael Rossetti played a major role in the Shelley renaissance of the seventies and eighties. In the history of Shelley scholarship his name deserves to be remembered and honored. Queens College Charlotte, North Carolina</page></plain_text>
