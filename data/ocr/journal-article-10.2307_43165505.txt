SELSAM Author TO needs WRITE to know about science, science to for know children children, an and author to needs to know science, to know children, and to know how to write - particularly to understand how to communicate with them on their level. Children are curious and ask questions. This is also a characteristic of most scientists at work. The question many younger children ask is often "What is it?" Once they have found out, they lose interest and forget. I have learned not to tell children the name of an object, no matter how familiar. I say, "Let's find out." I en- courage them to do something with the object found which would maintain their interest and heighten their observations. But knowledge gathered from observation alone is not enough. And a good science book is not just a collection of facts. A writer cannot just say, "Here is an exciting thing. See how a caterpillar spins a cocoon." The role of the writer is to write the book so a child can feel he is participating in an observation. It should send him out to look for his own caterpillars. Children are excellent observers, and if they are given a chance to look at things themselves, they will begin to appre- This article has been drawn from two previously published pieces by the author.

When I started to write Play With Vines, I felt exactly the way Darwin did about his book, Climbing Plants. He said he found himself so fascinated and perplexed by the revolving movements of tendrils and stems that he secured seeds of many climbing plants and studied the whole subject. Scientific books should, wherever possible, make sim- ple observations lead to other questions that can be answered by simple experiments. Watching a twining morning glory vine move around in a circle is exciting . . . but what about the amount of time it requires? Does the amount of light have anything to do with it? What about other vines? The purpose of science books should not be to fill a child's head with facts but to give him some idea of the great advances in science made by the linking of many observable facts into fundamental concepts. Good science books should certainly avoid incorrect concepts such as teleology, which explains everything in nature in terms of purpose. Statements like, "birds suddenly leave one locality and fly hundreds of miles to another place so that they will have food and a warmer climate in the new location" seem to close off all further inquiry. A scientific presentation of migration gives the facts as known to date from observation and experimentation, gives the best theories available, and shows what areas are still to be explored. Another common and equally incorrect concept is anthropomorphism, which sees everything in nature from a human point of view. Modern psychology stops this trend by trying to find out how the animal's mind works by studying its behavior. The study of animal behavior is fascinating enough by itself without being beclouded with an approach that ascribes human char- acteristics. The question of accuracy with regard to matters of APRIL 1973 19</page><page sequence="2">fact in a science book is less important than the goals above. As Eva Gordon said, "Accuracy means also a willingness to say, 'I don't know,' and in general, avoid- ance of sweeping statements and sparing use of such words as 'all,' 'every,' and 'always.' "* Good science books should communicate some of the excitement of discovery - and the triumph that goes with the solution of scientific problems. Books about science should help young people to see that our human goals must be shaped by science and that science must be enriched by human hopes and ideals. Science books can help to develop the idea that science is not mere knowledge of things independent of our human purposes or merely a means of giving us material comforts and gadgets, but is part of the fabric of our lives. The methods of science can be used to create rational atti- tudes free of superstition and prejudice. * Gordon, Eva, "Reviewing and Selecting Nature Tools for Children."
