<plain_text><page sequence="1">Potters and Paintresses. Women Designers in the Pottery Industry 1870-1955 CHERYL BUCKLEY. The Women's Press, 1990. 184 pp., 94 illus. ?16.95 paper. ISBN 07043 4211 1. Any serious attempt to chart the history and achievements of the pioneering women designers in the pottery indus- try is to be applauded, but this is by no means the limit to the brief which Cheryl Buckley has defined. She also intends to explain 'why and how women designed rather than ... what they designed', within the framework of design history, a 'relatively recent academic discipline', already flawed, it seems, by the ramifications of 'patri- archical assumptions that serve to devalue, marginalise and exclude women's contribution to design'. She would appear to have set herself an awesome task. It is open to question whether the time is yet ripe for an in-depth investi- gation such as Ms. Buckley advocates when the facts are still far from com- plete. There is little point in chewing over the why and how when the who and when as well as the what, in many cases, have still to be established. She is, perhaps, rather too swift to dismiss published monographs, notably those by Peter Rose on Hannah Barlow (1985), Bernard Bumpus on Charlotte Rhead (1987) and Ann Eatwell on Susie Cooper (1987) as being by and for pottery collectors and museum curators, by implication superficial in their treat- ment. Despite these books, retrospect- ive exhibitions of the work of Clarice Cliff (Brighton, 1972) and Susie Cooper (V&amp;A and Stoke-on-Trent, 1987), and the broadcasting of the popular Chan- nel 4 series Pottery Ladies (1985), there is still much work to be done before overall assessments such as Ms. Buckley attempts can be made. There is, as yet, no serious critical biography of Clarice Cliff. The status of the 'applied' or 'decor- ative' arts is another vexed question raised by Ms. Buckley and linked by her with the subjugation of women; inferior art, one infers, was deemed to be better suited to the inferior sex. Not since the medieval period have all the arts enjoyed equal prestige, employed, as they then were, to the greater glory of God. At a later date, the fine arts of painting and sculpture were divided from design and the functional arts allied to architecture which included furniture design, metalwork, ceramics, glass, textiles, and the arts of the book. None of these is an inherently female activity and the author should make clear that those she lists were those considered most suitable for a women to practice at home during the Victorian period. The period in question coincides with the emergence of the designer in industry, a role which had not existed, as such, before Christopher Dresser. Those designers flourished who made the most of the opportunities offered by changes in technology and adapted most successfully to the economic restrictions imposed. It is notable that in a relatively short time-span, so many women took up the challenge and achieved such success as designers, particularly in the Potteries, where the odds seem to have been stacked against them. Cheryl Buckley is at her most per- suasive when describing the appalling conditions endured by women during the mid-nineteenth century in *the Staffordshire potteries, where they made up a substantial, and increasing sector of the work force. Although nominally restricted to aspects of the work considered appropriate to their sex, namely the repetitive application of detailed surface decoration, they were nevertheless exploited in the more physically strenuous tasks of the slip house and potting shop. They were employed in these capacities because they were cheap labour; from 1836 to 1947, in spite of temporary advances earned during two world wars, women were consistently paid little over half men's wages for similar work. In addition, men treated them with mistrust, understandable when they appeared to threaten men's jobs during times of recession. There was also a certain amount of immoral behaviour recorded where men and women worked together, of which women were generally the victims, and bastardy was a common occurrence. Women were also particularly vulnerable to industrial diseases such as lead poisoning and pneumoconiosis. They were ineligible for membership and therefore the protection of craft unions and were denied access to the opportunities for education which could have assisted their careers. The slow but persistent struggle for improved working condi- tions for all and some measure of equality with the male workforce is soundly researched and well docu- mented. The question of biology, raised fre- quently by the author, is not, of course, limited to open prejudice in the work- place. Ms. Buckley subscribes to Griselda Pollock's definition of patri- archy as a deep-rooted 'web of psycho- social relationships', more subtle and insidious than the 'static, oppressive domination of one sex over another'. In the pottery industry this is probably most simply demonstrated by the language used to ascribe feminine qualities, skills, and weaknesses to the products of women pottery designers. Such language is most often found in the trade journals which are, ironically, some of the few publications to mention many of the lesser known figures. Ms. Buckley takes issue with the stereotypic qualities assigned to the methods and motifs employed by women decorators. She states of Hannah Barlow's sgraffito Journal of Design History Vol. 3 Nos. 2-3 ? 1990 The Design History Society 0952-4649/90 $3.00 197</page><page sequence="2">work applied to Doulton stoneware, 'her depictions of animals were rarely sentimental and there are no examples in her work of animals taking on human characteristics', which is more than can be said for the work of George Tin- worth, her eccentric colleague at Doulton, famous for his whimsical and anthropomorphic mouse and frog tableaux. Hannah Barlow was, of course, one of the many female employees of Henry Doulton, who were moved, in 1882, to present him with a commemorative volume in gratitude for the opportun- ities he had afforded them. Is pater- nalism perhaps the acceptable face of patriarchy? The issue is raised again in the role played by Gordon Mitchell Forsyth, the magus of the mid- twentieth century pottery industry. The careers of almost all the designers considered by Ms. Buckley were affected by his influence or advice. He taught Jessie van Hallen, Freda Beard- more, Clarice Cliff, Susie Cooper, and Peggy Davies, and helped to place many others with firms. Some of the factors relating to the lives and work of twentieth-century women designers are indisputably bio- logical. The careers of the majority were cut short by marriage and child-rearing so that it is remarkable that their work is known at all. Star Wedgwood worked at Wedgwood only from about 1930-7, Anne Potts at Bullers from 1935-9, and Jean Cowper from 1937-9. If such women returned to pottery design after their children were grown, it was often to teach. Jessie van Hallen, on the other hand, only began working at Wades after the births of her children, and the birth of a son in 1943 did not prevent Susie Cooper from relaunching her business in 1945. This she did only with the support of her husband, Cecil Barker, as business partner, a not uncommon practice. The husband of Peggy Davies, a designer for Doulton, 'took a year off from teaching to under- take a pottery management course in order to help her career'. Best known and most controversial among the designers considered by Ms. Buckley is Clarice Cliff, whose bright coloured, hand-painted designs applied to earthenware vessels in 'modern' geometric shapes proved as popular with the antique trade in the 1970S and i98os as they had when they were launched upon an unsuspecting public in the late 1920S. The products of her studio, the Newport Pottery, at A. J. Wilkinson's, showed only a superficial grasp of the contemporary French designs on which they were based. Many of her shapes were impractical; solid triangular handles on teapots became too hot to hold and the corners of rectangular plates were easily chipped. She borrowed forms from metalwork by Jean Tetard, published in Mobilier et Decoration, and pattern designs from book illustrations, the pochoir prints of Benedictus and carpets by da Silva Bruhns. Much work has still to be done to separate her ideas for decoration from those of the more talented paintresses who worked for her. Clarice Cliff's greatest skills lay in the promotion and marketing of her wares and her sound understanding of public taste. Whether or not she was a good designer is unproven. There can be no disputing the achievements of Susie Cooper. Albeit blessed with the advantages of an enlightened, middle-class background, against all advice she founded and managed her own company at a time of recession, designing successful shapes as well as decoration that was easy for her paintresses to apply. When eco- nomic strictures made hand-painting impractical she moved effortlessly to the application of inspired lithographic prints. She believed passionately in the promotion of good design and her integrity was rewarded as early as 1940 when she was made a Royal Designer for Industry. Despite the eloquence of Ms. Buckley's argument that prejudice against Clarice Cliff is based on class snobbery there is no comparison between her and Susie Cooper as designers. Cliff was an impresario, orchestrating and promoting the ideas of others while Cooper was an inno- vator who excelled in all aspects of her industry. She transcended the achieve- ments of the men at Wedgwood with whom the author equates her; Keith Murray, a free-lance designer limited to shape and glazes, Eric Ravilious who originated only designs for prints and Victor Skellern, the Arts Director, not the Managing Director, of his firm. Cheryl Buckley has condensed a great deal of research into a well-organized book of modest length. She is forthright in stating her theories and views even when the facts would appear to con- tradict them. She presents a great deal of original material gleaned at first hand from interviews with living designers. It is a shame that the list of designers could not have been more compre- hensive to include, for instance, Stella Crofts and Gwendolyn Parnell who worked for Royal Worcester. There are a number of editorial or typographical errors which irritate, particularly in designers' names; acknowledgement at the beginning should presumably be to Agnete, not Anita Hoy, Mabel Lucie Attwell has two 't's, and the Marseilles factory was run, not by the Vauve, but by the Veuve (widow) Perrin, like the great champagne vineyard of Clicquot. More serious, in view of Ms. Buckley's allegations of class prejudice, are care- less, contradictory statements such as, 'Millie Taplin was one of the few working-class women to become a professional designer in the pottery industry. . .' (p. ioo), and 'Middle-class women in particular attended art school, studied in Paris ... Susie Cooper, Charlotte Rhead and Millie Taplin are all evidence of this ... (p. 162). Silly mistakes and mean black and white illustrations, crammed several to a page, make this otherwise very worthy book seem rather poor quality for its price (?16.50), given that the previous publication to which the author contributed, A View from the Interior, edited by Attfield and Kirkham (1989), of larger format with the same number of pages of plates, also published by the Women's Press, cost only ?8.95.
