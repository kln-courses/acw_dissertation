<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHOFAR 5 3 FALL 1985 "A NARRATIVE OF RAIN" The Flood: Genesis 6:5-9:29 by Jan Wojcik God again appears troubled about the way human beings have turned out, and uncertain what to do about them. First he says he's going to destroy everything; but he arranges to have a rem- nant saved; then he finds that that remnant turns out to bear spores of all that God found distressing before the flood. Noah gets drunk and angry with one of his sons whom he curses. His sons found families that eventually branch into peoples who found cities that will disgust God again: Babel, Nineveh, Sodom and Gomorrah, among others. We find the same uncertain affection for the nature that God had made and declared "good." He includes animals in the race of men when he first expresses his disgust: "This race of men whom I have created, I will wipe them off the face of the earth -- man and beast, reptiles and birds," although it is never clear just how the animals have offended him particularly. Perhaps he simply wants to destroy everything and anything that humans could take pleasure in. Taking away the animals takes away the image of God given to humans: "to rule over the things of the earth." Perhaps God just can't make up his mind whether it was a good idea or not to have made a universe to exist in some way independently of himself. In either case, his anger with the unpredictable is again tempered. He orders mating pairs of every bird, animal and reptile saved. When the ark comes to rest on dry land again he re-establishes the same order in creation he set up the first time. To Noah he says all living things "are given into your hands. Every creature that lives and moves shall be food for you; I give you them all, as once I gave you all green plants" (9:3). The story portrays God's feelings as being as temperamental as the changing seasons. Winter is his frown, Spring his smile. Nature and human nature respond to him as the climate to the changing tilt of the earth's axis. When presumably seeds of the old plants survived by floating in the ark of their own husks, they each symbolize the whole ark of the animals and humans as similarly a seed of Eden, bound to bear the same fruit again and again, but for the moment after the flood burgeoning with a fresh green sprout. Even thistles look good in the Spring before the gardener has to bend down in the heat and start hoeing them out. The rainbow is an apt symbol of the covenant God makes with nature. It's made of water vapor, the same stuff of the seas and clouds. The link it forms is ephemeral, wavering, and beautiful while it lasts. When it appears the storm is past, the violence spent, both sky and earth relax and collect themselves.</page><page sequence="2">SHOFAR 54 FALL 1985 The prose of this story sounds something like the rain of the storm itself. Hard rain, even when it begins to swell up in pools and flooding, is still always awesome and beautiful. It clears the air; it falls rhythmically, varying the intensity of the drumming, as the wind, its storm companion, shifts. The sound it makes is hypnotizing: varied slightly every moment, the sound steadily remains the same. The rhythmic effects in the narrative result from the editing together and combining this time the two separate versions of the one story. Instead of fol- lowing one another like distinct variations on a theme, the ver- sions run after each other like motifs in a fugue. The account begins describing God's disgust in three verses saying approximately the same thing: Now God saw that the whole world was corrupt and full of violence. In his sight the world had become corrupted, for all men had lived corrupt lives on earth. God said to Noah, "The loathsomeness of all mankind has become plain to me, for through them the earth is full of violence." (6:11-14) According to modern scholarship (see background notes) the Priestly writer wrote this; the ritualistic sounding repetitions are characteristic of the style we also find in the first creation account. But the same effect results when we place together lines alternately attributed to both the Yahwist and Priestly writer: I intend to bring the waters of the flood over the earth (P-6:17); In seven days' time I will send rain over the earth (J- 7 : 4) ; And so, to escape the waters of the flood, Noah went into the ark with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives (P-7:6-7); Towards the end of seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth (J- 7: 10); the flood continued upon the earth for forty days (P- 7 : 17) . The editing catches the flavor and tone of the Priestly style and causes it to dominate the account. This is not a narrative in a hurry to get someplace. The story savors its own words in the telling, rolling them over and over the tongue of its narrator. Sounds echo in the reader's inner ear. This is a narrative of rain, and of a God as majestic as the storm. Perhaps part of the hold on the Western imagination this story has had comes from its sounding so well. But the editing catches the Yahwist image of God as well: God as a tentative, gusty wind. At one point God tells Noah to take "living creatures . . ., two of each kind" with him (P-6:19), at another, "take with you seven pairs, male and female, of all</page><page sequence="3">SHOFAR 55 FALL 1985 beasts that are not clean" (J-7:2-3). According to the Yahwist, the rain falls 40 days, and the flood lasts 61 days; to the Priestly writer, the rain falls 40 days and the flood lasts a year and ten days. The uncertainty of numbers reflects the uncertainty of divine thinking. Curiously, the narrative stitching creates a portrait of God as now being simultaneously majestic and tentative; the composite picture of the two Genesis creation accounts becomes a complex picture. This God has emotions ranging from pride to disgust with what he's done, and an anger always checked by a hesitancy to punish his creation too severely. However human- like God was before the Hebrews began to tell their stories about him, willy-nilly he grows more human as he shares billing with human characters he finds both irascible and irresistable . The narrative voice in this scene becomes more articulated than it has been in previous stories. It is as if, along with the first fully integrated story, the voice is given to speak with a more confident sense of identity. The narrator looks un- flinchingly into God's mind at the beginning of the story: "When the LORD saw that man had done much evil on earth . . . , he was sorry that he had made man. ..." (6:5-8). Later the voice notes that "God thought of Noah and all the wild animals. ..." The voice hovers in the background at the end, noting and report- ing what only an intimate of God's could see: his contentedly enjoying the smell of Noah's roasting sacrificial animals. Where the first promise of good will God gave out loud directly to Noah (6:18), now after the flood he speaks only for the intimate ear of the narrator and those readers whom the voice lets in on the scene: "Never again will I curse the ground because of man. ..." (8:21). The narrator's role as a messenger or go-between appears more settled. His intimate report of God's promise for the future is the first clear example of biblical prophetic narrative -- the mode that has been developing since the narrator first reported God's unseen past actions at the beginning of creation and noted the future consequences of the first human sin. But the narrative voice still somehow emanates from the mind of God. It shares uncertainty most notably in the story of 9:18- 29. Noah lies drunk; Ham, always mentioned second in the list of Noah's sons, is now said to be the "youngest." He sees his father naked and tells his brothers about it. His brothers cover up their father, who, upon awakening, curses Canaan, Ham's son. It isn't clear in the story why Ham's son is cursed, or indeed, what it is that Ham has done. There has been no mention in the Bible to this point of any ritual responsibility sons have to a naked father. Noah's reaction remains opaque, the narrative unclarity an analogy for God's own uncertainty about what he has wrought with the making of the beginning of human history. For all their independence, something still links authorial mind and narrative voice, just as something links God and humans in the same story.</page><page sequence="4">SHOFAR 56 FALL 1985 BACKGROUND ï The division o£ versions is thought generally to run as fol- lows: The Yahwist is responsible for 7:15, 7, 16b, 8-10, 12, 17b, 22-23; 8:6a, 2b, 3a, 6b, 8-12, 13b, 20. The Priestly writer re- sponsible for 6:9-22; 7:6, 11, 13-16b, 17a, 18-21, 24; 8;l-2a, 3b, 4-5, 7, 13a, 15-19. von Rad finds the whole flood story a unity: "The biblical story of the flood as it now exists is an ingenius interweaving of the two sources J and P" (Gerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commen- tary [SCM Press: London, 1976), p. 119. But he still thinks it necessary to separate the traditions to "penetrate the thought more precisely" (p. 119). For example, when he isolates the Yah- wist version, it begins (with the material now at 7:1) with Noah being told to go into the ark before he's told about the flood. This von Rad takes to be a test of faith like Abraham had to en- dure. Assuredly the disrupted text does imply what von Rad says; but the text, undisrupted, does not. 6:5-8 von Rad comments that in these lines "for the first time the narrator himself speaks completely on his own" (p. 116). 6:15 The measurements would be approximately 440' x 73' x 44'. See A. Heidel , The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels (1946), p. 236. 6:17 Mabbul means not flood but the "heavenly ocean" that spills through the windows of the sky. For the Priestly writer the whole cosmos becomes disrupted and chaotic. 7:5 The depreciation of unclean animals reflects an early Yahwist faith's struggle with ancient animal cults who worshipped these animals (von Rad, p. 120). 8:21-22 God's "smelling" the soothing odor of Noah's sacri- fice is an anthropomorphism firmly established in the Gilgamesh Epic that the Yahwist was not troubled enough by "to erase" (von Rad, p. 122). One reason theYahwist might have left it in is that the Hebrew expression reah hannihoan forms an assonance with noah. 9:8-17 "A covenent (berit) is meant to clarify an intricate or opaque legal situation between two groups or individuals in that it puts the relationship of the partners on a new legal basis" (von Rad, p. 133). 10:18-29 Speiser lists the unanswerable questions in this puzzling narrative as, why is Canaan, Ham's son cursed and not Ham; why is Ham called the youngest son in v. 24 when in all the lists he is mentioned second. Modern scholarship, he says, specu- lates that perhaps there was another tradition drawn on here where Ham was the youngest, and his son Canaan did some foul deed not mentioned here (E.A. Speiser, Genesis: The Anchor Bible [Garden City, New York, 1964]). * * *</page></plain_text>
