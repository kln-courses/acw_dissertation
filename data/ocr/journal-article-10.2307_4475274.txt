<plain_text><page sequence="1">VENUS AND THE CABBAGE The views and opinions which in the course of the last century and a half historians and critics of Roman religion have held about the origins of the Venus-cult in Rome are, as one might expect, symptomatic of a succession of fashions and phases and theories about ancient religion generally. F. LAJARD published his book Recherches sur le culte, les symboles, les attributs et les mo- numents figur's de Vnus en Orient et en Occident (I837), when comparative, or perhaps better, 'synthesizing' religion was in its prime, and it was believed that the fundamentals of religious development were the same throughout the Mediterranean basin, giving rise to purely regional differences; that Venus was simply a Roman Astarte. Twenty-one years later, on the other side of the Rhine, PRELLER published his Romische Mythologie, a work informed by the all-pervading notion that ancient gods were in origin nature-symbols. Reaction against these naturalizing and synthesizing tendencies finally ex- pressed itself authoritatively when MOMMSEN'S pupil G. WISSOWA produced his Religion und Kultus der Romer in I902 (second edition I9I2). WIssowA was chiefly concerned to separate off the foreign elements in Roman religion and to analyse the remaining, genuinely native, concepts. Now, since I950, there has been a slight swing-back of the pendulum, and some of what WISSOWA claimed as indigenous Italian elements have been subjected to an attempt to</page><page sequence="2">Venus and the Cabbage 449 reclaim them, not for the Mediterranean in general, but for Greece in particular. In the specific case of the origins of the Venus-cult, R. SCHILLING, La Religion Romaine de Venus, I954 and CARL KOCH, Religio: Studien zu Kult und Glau- ben der Romer, I960, especially ch. 3 Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der r6mischen Venus-Verehrung = Hermes 83, I955, pp. I sqq., have undermined the whole structure of WIssowA's view by asserting that its peculiar features were to be found in Greece from where, like so much else, they must have come. In fact, a student of Roman religion thirty years ago could have a very clear and satisfying picture of the beginnings of Venus-worship. He would already have discovered in WILAMOWITZ, Der Glaube der Hellenen, I93I, I, p. 96, a categorical denial, couched in the strongest terms, that Aphrodite in Greek cult ever had anything to do with vegetative life in nature. Turning toWissowA, RuK2 pp. 288 sqq. or to RoSCHER, M. L., I937, s.V. Venus, col. i88 sq., where he says substantially the same, he would discover that the name Venus was apparently first applied to the charm and blossom of nature, then to the goddess who controlled them, who, in the practical Roman mind was specifically ordained as protectress of gardens and vegetable-growing'; but that the sub- sequent broadening of the name's application to grace and beauty in general was effected by the infiltrating figure of the Greek Aphrodite. The two pro- nouncements of MOMMSEN'S son-in-law and MOMMSEN'S pupil combined into a harmonious whole to form the view still generally accepted, popularized in introductory handbooks such as V. BASANOFF'S, Les Dieux des Romains, I942, PP. I34 sqq., and H. J. RoSE's, Ancient Roman Religion, I948, P. 93. The student of today, however, is confronted with completely different assertions. If he consults KOCH (op. cit. esp. pp. 48 sq.) and SCHILLING (op. cit. pp.I3 sqq.), he will discover that Venus as connected with the charms of nature was not an indigenous, purely Italian concept, but was derived from one aspect of the cult of Aphrodite which did regard her as a vegetative lifeforce. Such a reversal of judgement so eminent is astonishing and surely warrants a closer examination of the evidence. It will be convenient at the outset to review the evidence on which Wis- SOWA's view was based, and to offer some comments on it. (i) C.I.L. IV 2776: an inscription engraved on a vessel found at Pompeii: presta mi sinceru(m), sic te amet que custodit ortu(m) Venus, 'offer me pure wine (sub. vinum), so may Venus, who protects the garden, love you'. The handle terminates in the head of a bearded old man, identified by SCHILLING (op. cit. pp. i6-I7) with Priapus. If the reading mi is correct and the vessel is a wine- jar, the request must be addressed to the vine-gardener and wine-storer (on a small vineyard, of course, one and the same man); if the reading is not correct (i. e. if the painter has illiterately written mi for me, cf. vas sincerum Hor. 1 A view already to be found in E. AUST, Religion der Romer, I899, pp. I44 sq. Hermes 91,4 29</page><page sequence="3">450 P. T. EDEN Sat. I, 3, 56, Epp. I, 2, 54) and the meaning is 'keep me clean.. .', one can deduce no more than that the request may be addressed to a gardener. The vessel is dated to the late Republican period, by when its area of provenance, Campania, had a long tradition of Greek influence; as evidence for the origins of the Venus-cult, therefore, it is quite indecisive because the inscription may echo a much later view. (ii) A fragment of Naevius (ed. E. V. MARMORALE, 2nd ed. I950, pp. 228-9) Cocus edit Nefitunum Cererem ....... et Venerem expertam Volcanum, Liberumque obsorbuit pariter. Paulus, Excerpta Festi p. 5I L.: Cocum et pistorem apud antiquos eundem fuisse accepimus. Naevius: Cocus, inquit, edit Neptunum, Venerem, Cererem. Significat per Cererem panem, per Neptunum pisces, per Venerem holera. (Sub- stantially the same occurs in other glossaries cited by MARMORALE). There can be little doubt that Naevius intended the words Venerem ex- pertam Volcanum as a double-entendre: on one level, an allusion to the marital relations of the pair (his punishment of her adultery with Mars?) - indeed this may be the main 'comic' point of the phrase. But it must also, necessarily, be capable of being understood at the same level as the surrounding context. Naevius's lines have a paratragic (or paraepic) ring: in dignified poetry the equation Ceres _ 'corn' or 'bread', Volcanus -'fire', Liber - 'wine', must already have been quite familiar; Neptunus ='fish' rather than 'water' is unusual but reasonable. But what of Venus ='vegetables'? It is difficult to believe that Festus's express statement is based merely on the deduction that after subtracting fish and bread from the poor Italian's meatless diet only vegetables remain. It is even more difficult to believe that Naevius intended or expected his audience to make such a deduction. WACKERNAGEL, Vor- lesungen fiber Syntax II, I928, p. 63 says of the fragment 'einiges hievon ist komische Improvisation'. SCHILLING, OP. cit. pp. I7-I8, develops this into 'loin d'avoir une valeur permanente, l'assimilation Venus-legumes est un trait fugitif, jailli dans le feu de l'improvisation' (cf. KOCH, OP. cit. p. 49). Thrown in the fire indeed, if the audience had no chance of understanding it, and an incredible coincidence if Naevius accidentally hit on an idea of this kind supplied by independent evidence. Only two alternatives remain: that Naevius himself was the originator of the equation, which subsequently became well- established (which is surely highly improbable), or that he and the audience already had some basis, however slender, for making the identification. (iii) Pliny, N. H. I9, 50: ... hortoque et foro tantum contra invidentium effascinationes dicari videmus in remedio saturica signa, quamquam hortos tutelae Veneris adsignante Plauto. Saturica signa, of course, means statues of Priapus, the usual protecting deity of gardens. Foro presumably refers especial- ly to the forum olitorium (cf. Varro, L. L. 5, I46, Livy 2I, 62, 4).</page><page sequence="4">Venus and the Cabbage 45I In all probability the citation from Plautus is a translation of a Greek original, or at any rate an adaptation of a Greek idea, but even this cannot be entirely certain. Pliny's remark in its context is an irrelevant piece of literary learning, but it shows that he clearly regarded the ascription of gardens to the protection of Venus as exceptional. (iv) Varro, L. L. 6, 20: Vinalia rustica dicuntur ante diem XII(II) Kalen- das Septembres, quod tum Veneri dedicata aedes et horti ei deae dicantur ac tum sunt feriati holitores. There is no good reason to disbelieve Varro's statement that the igth August (Julian calendar) was the day on which gardens were dedicated to Venus and vegetable-growers kept holiday. A 'festival' of vegetable-growers suggests the corporate action of a guild, however loosely organized, and this, as Kurt LATTE, Romische Religionsgeschichte, p. I87, points out, is unlikely to have come into existence at any early date. The temple of Venus Obsequens near the Circus Maximus, the oldest dateable Roman temple to Venus, had been begun by Quintus Fabius Gurges in 295 B.C. out of funds provided by erring matronae - a fairly certain in- dication that the goddess's title Obsequens has reference to relations between the sexes. Its dedication day was the i9th August, the feast day of the Vinalia rustica (which could, however, originally have had nothing to do with Venus- pace Varro, cited below-, because unlike her it figures in the oldest calendars). (iv) Varro, R.R. I, i, i6: Item adveneror Minervam et Venerem quarum unius procuratio oliveti, alterius hortorum; quo nomine rustica Vinalia instituta. Little need be said about this passage except that Minerva's protection of the olive clearly rests on her identification with Athene, and so Venus here may be a hellenized Aphrodite-Venus (pace WISSOWA, Hermes I9I7, PP. 97 sqq.). The tentative inferences I have drawn may be summarized as follows. (A) It is likely that during the lifetime of Naevius there existed in the po- pular mind some connection between Venus and vegetables; (B) the fragment of Plautus, the statement of Varro in the proem to the Res Rustica, and the inscription all suggest with varying degrees of strength, that the office of Venus as protectress of gardens was a Greek concept, familiar in Rome at least as early as Plautus; (C) Varro, L.L. 6, 20, links the two ideas of gardens and vegetables and associates them both with Venus in reference to practices which can hardly be of any ancient date. The evidence is not strong enough to support WISSowA's view, and an unbiased critic is likely to accept the destructive arguments convincingly put forward by SCHILLING, OP. cit. pp. I4 sqq. If WIssowA s view is incorrect, and Venus's connection with vegetation was not a native Italian concept, then obviously it must have been imported. Kurt LATTE, Op. cit. p. I87, accept- ing WILAMOWITZ's denial of any such Greek concept, tentatively suggests that it may have reached Rome with the arrival of Venus Erycina from Sicily, 29*</page><page sequence="5">452 P. T. EDEN where the cult of Aphrodite on Mount Eryx was early exposed to assimilation with the Carthaginian goddess Tanit. Obscurum per obscutrius. S. WEINSTOCK in his review of LATTE'S work rightly casts doubt on the value of this sugges- tion, J.R.S. 5I, I96I, P. 208 . . . eVenus's guardianship of horticulture for which LATTE has no satisfactory explanation'. The alternative is to attack WILAMOWITZ, and this is the course taken by SCHILLING and KOCH, whose evidence and conclusions must now in turn be examined. SCHILLING's arguments are as follows, op. cit. pp. i8 sqq.: from Alexandrian times the cult of Priapus, the object of special attention in Lampsacus on the Hellespont, spread into Italy via Campania from the third century B. C. onwards, and brought with it the mythological association of Priapus with Aphrodite. This is a legitimate conclusion from the statements of Pausanias 9, 3I, 2, Servius auctus ad Georg. 4, iii, and Diodorus Siculus 4, 6, i, who all attest that Priapus was regarded as the son of Aphrodite and Dionysus (or Venus and Liber). The earliest authority is the last, Diodorus (first century B. C.), and he ascribes this myth to 'the ancients': ,mvOo2oyovo3v oVv ot na,Aao HQt'a7xov vlOv /ZdV Edvat JtovV'aov xal' 'Ageo6tTig, n'OavCb; -v)v yeveortv Ta-trvv 8 qyo'6svor -o'g y&amp; o'vO brag qvcrtx6Jg brer6afakt neog r&amp;g adeo6tortaxa&amp;g r1ovag. The evidence of a vase from Cales of the third or second century B.C. showing Pan and Cupid, under the eyes of Aphrodite, wrestling near a figure of Priapus, makes possible more precise dating. Other vases too associate Priapus and Aphrodite. SCHILLING infers that the inseparable attribute of Priapus, his patronage of the fertility of vines and gardens, transferred itself to Aphro- dite. It is impossible to deny that such a transference may have taken place, but it is significant that all the evidence cited above nowhere mentions or hints at any vegetative connection of either deity. In fact the most natural inference from the evidence is that their association is a very secondary, late, and ra- tionalizing connection, made when the original or early significance of their respective cults had been forgotten (an inference corroborated by the whole tenour of Diodorus's explanation cited above). The traditional form of statues of Priapus and his patronage of gardens point to an early belief in the intimate relationship of human (animal) and vegetable reproduction which can be easily paralleled from other primitive cultures'. But such primitive ideas had long since been lost sight of, or had at any rate been reduced to insignificance, by the time the Alexandrian rationalizers of mythology occupied themselves with establishing relationships between gods I J. G. FRAZER, The Golden Bough, Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild I, pp. 5 sqq., cites an interesting example of sympathetic magic operating in a reverse direction, from vegetable life to human life, in the use of a winnowing-fan as a cradle, attested in Asia as well as Europe.</page><page sequence="6">Venus and the Cabbage 453 of a purely anthropomorphic kind. The figures on the Cales vase, Pan and Priapus (saturica signa cf. Pliny N. H. I9, 50, quoted above, p. 450) on the one side, and Aphrodite and Cupid on the other, owe their commingling to their common participation in ideas of human procreation. A later stage of reassociation, of the kind SCHILLING suggests, may have taken place, but there is no evidence to suggest it did. SCHILLING, however, uses his conclusion to explain the joint priesthoods of Ceres and Venus attested by various inscriptions, op. cit. p. 20, and continues 'cet aspect de fecondite vegetale est en effet attest6e dans le culte grec d'Aphro- dite: il a ete mieux mis en lumiere depuis les travaux recents de LUDWIG DEUBNER' (sc. Attische Feste, I932, pp. 9 sqq.). There follows a description of the festival of the dQQqo'QoL based on DEUBNER, but arriving at a very different conclusion. SCHILLING and DEUBNER both believe that the purpose of the mysterious rites of this festival was to promote the fertility of the crops. The a'Q?qra tea', as is clear from Schol. Lucian S. 276,I3 RABE, were phallic symbols: these are stated by Pausanias I, 27, 3 to have been provided by the priestess of Athena Polias on the Acropolis, and taken to the enclosure of 'Ao9Qo6tiT V x7/Cotg by an underground passage. There they were deposited to be impregnated with life-giving virtue emanating, according to SCHILLING, from the goddess Aphrodite herself. This, in his view, confirms her connection with 'fecondite vegetale'. As has already been pointed out, there is nothing surprising about such a primitive association of ideas of human and vegetable reproduction. It is however surely significant that what Aphrodite blesses are exclusively symbols of the former (nothing is said about the latter), which, if DEUBNER'S theory is correct, have power over vegetable life only by virtue of a belief in sympathetic magic. In any case, DEUBNER himself drew a different conclusion from his interpretation of the festival (op. cit. I5): 'Die geheimen Begehungen der Arrephoren zeigen uns Athena als die Beschiitzerin der menschlichen und vegetativen Fruchtbarkeit. Es ist jene Seite der G6ttin, die in ihrem altesten, matronalen, thronenden Typus zum Ausdruck gelangt'. SCHILLING also accepts as "a peu pres certain' (p. 2I) the localisation of a shrine to 'Ageo8tTRi e'v Xqnotg by Oscar BRONEER (Hesperia I, I932, PP. 3I sqq., Eros and Aphrodite on the North Slope of the Acropolis in Athens). But the existence of such a cult at the precipitous cleft indicated (a site presumably as unsuitable for a garden in antiquity as it undoubtedly is now) is not certain, depending as it does ultimately only on two inscriptions found there, one beginning Tt 'Eeoort h E soeole, the other bearing nothing more than the letters A0PO. BRONEER'S emphasis on the vegetative connection of this joint cult is directed not to Aphrodite but to Eros; '. . . the Eros in our inscrip- tion was doubtless worshipped as a god of vegetation, and with him Aphrodite, called Aphrodite 8v X77otg, would fittingly be associated' (one might well ask at this point if there were any gods in the Greek pantheon not connected</page><page sequence="7">454 P. T. EDEN with vegetation), although he had previously said 'The worship of Aphrodite in the Gardens, i. e. as a vegetation divinity, was widespread'. He cites various authorities for this assertion, the earliest, as one might have expected, being PRELLER-ROBERT, Griechische Mythologie , I894, PP. 358 sqq. '. The theory of Greek gods as personifications of natural forces, extremely valuable as it is, ceases to be helpful if applied indiscriminately to quite different layers of Greek culture and religion. KOCH's argument (op. cit. pp. 48 sqq.) relating to the 'vegetative' aspect of the Aphrodite cult is more compressed and must be carefully examined. He begins by saying 'DaB3 die Liebesg6ttin in Griechenland vielerorts (not so many) 8v xIpotg verehrt wurde, ist haufig bezeugt' (which is undeniable2). 'Diese Garten waren groBenteils Gemtiseanpflanzungen' (an entirely un- justified and unsupported generalization); 'auch fur die athenischen der Gottin hat man diese Art der Verwendung als die urspungliche vermutet' (vermutet, yes, although OLCK, RE Art. Gartenbau 783, to whom KOCH refers, while allowing that the xinot in the Ilissos valley may have served the (early) community's requirements in the way of flowers and vegetables, adds that they also probably became pleasure-gardens (later). 'Auch wenn wir nicht eine inschriftliche Bezeugung besaB3en, diirften wir den SchluB wagen, daB die Pachter solcher Garten-in der Mehrzahl holitores (why?)-die Aphrodite verehrten und bestimmte Opfer ihr darzubringen hatten. Aber eine Urkunde aus Kos erwahnt das Aphroditeopfer 'der Pachter der heiligen Garten' aus- drucklich.' This inscription from Cos is to be found in M. P. NILSSON, Grie- chische Feste, I906, P. 379. In its entirety it gives a view of the background of the cult of Aphrodite at Halasarna on Cos, where it was discovered, which is substantially different from what KOCH leads one to expect from his partial quotation of it, and lends little support to his assertion. The full text of it is as follows (from PATON and HICKS, Inscriptions of Cos, Nr. 369): Ov'rco o i]- e[qe]vb roil 'Andr&amp;)oA vog ?v Tcot z[4yvl T6t H1ava]jso[t r&amp;t] iflU6zat alya Tit 'Aqeob4t[at &amp;or 6ea]XFdv st'xoat xal rit e'varat roil [avrovi ,u'vo6] atya a&amp;7o TOV 't'ov %at' (t)a2&lt;a&gt;t6ta T[8'TTaea]. btayeaqo'VTO r TO' vwxolat TCO[t adet 1 PRELLER-ROBERT'S use as evidence of some attributes of Aphrodite such as exa.7rog is rightly qualified by JEBB-PEARSON on Soph. frg. 847. 2 KOCH refers the reader (p. 48, note i) to E. LANGLOTZ, Aphrodite in den Garten, I954, a monograph chiefly devoted to examining representations in art of what LANGLOTZ identifies as the cult of Aphrodite Ev irotg x?7laoi. From about 430 B. C. vase-painters represent Aphrodite in a garden on a hillock. His first example (an aryballos, BM E 697. FR 78,2) may be taken as typical and representative: the goddess (her name, APPOAITH, above her head) sits on a hillock with flowers growing on it and trees on either side of it. This basic theme recurs with insignificant modifications and leads LANGLOTZ to identify Aphrodite Iv xol; %'nroi with the 'sitting Aphrodite' type in Greco-Roman art. Recogni- sably edible plants and vegetable-growers play no part in representations of this type, although flowers, plants and trees do appear with varying degrees of stylization.</page><page sequence="8">Venus and the Cabbage 455 net]a,uevcot rav tieexv'vvav ev -r-t 1[ xV[l c---] ot xa alA a; beaxya; 8'X0(l ccraTe Ov'[ev trdt 'A]qQo6tiTat alya- Ovtw 68' Xal O6 lse); ro[i 'A;rd2]A2vo; Tat EdVacit aiya koT baQXydv d7[xoct].

Let the officials in charge of the temple fabric pay another twenty drachmas in the month - - - to the man who is at any time the purchaser of the priesthood, so that he sacrifices a goat to Aphrodite. And let the priest of Apollo also sacrifice a goat on the twentieth (bought) out of twenty drachmas. And let those who have contracted for the upkeep of the holy gardens and the baths also sacrifice, each of them a kid (bought) out of fifteen drachmas#. vamolat is the Doric form of vEwwolat, officials in charge of the temple fabric (LSJ 9). From what is said about them one may deduce that they have some kind of financial control; it is they who are likely to have contracted with one specific individual for the priesthood, and with several individuals for the upkeep of the holy gardens and the baths. The contractors' income will have come from the fee they charged for admission to the baths and perhaps also to the holy gardens. Nothing in the inscription suggests that the yUe4ut- aOw,&amp;Vot were holitores, and it seems improbable in the last degree that holy gardens were rented to raise a crop of vegetables, or that the baths existed for the benefit of soil-covered kitchen-gardeners. The situation lying behind the inscription seems, on the contrary, to belong to one of the acknowledgedly civilized aspects of Greek culture rather than to its equally acknowledged retention of some very early and primitive ideas. As at Arsinoe near Paphos (see Strabo cited below, P.455), there may originally have been a woodland glade which was in part at least improved by the hand of man and cultivated to form a 'garden' (perhaps 'park' would be a better translation) -it is at any rate prima facie unlikely that an infertile spot would have been chosen; here, after bathing, the townsfolk of Halasarna could enjoy a stroll and relax. The charm of the place and the traditional occupations of strolling leisure made the choice of patron deity certain. In other words, Aphrodite's connec- tion with such a locality can be explained perfectly satisfactorily with reference to her anthropomorphic attributes, without having recourse to any unsubstan- tiated (and therefore a priori) theory about her connection with vegetation. And the same holds good for other localities where Aphrodite was wor- shipped ?V M77Ol;: at a place called Arsinoe near Paphos on Cyprus (Strabo I4,683 xat aAAry 'Aeawvo'2, 65uoaiw Co'aoelzov Exovaa xat leQOv xat Vlaog- Ytxeov 6' a6ro -ci OaAd'-T?7; xat q hIeoxrnnt;); and at Athens in a district known as the K~rrot, probably situated in the Ilissos valley (Pausanias i, I9, 2</page><page sequence="9">456 P. T. EDEN Pliny N. H. 36, i6). These gardens are surely likely to have contained not cabbages and cauliflowers, but the roses and myrtles with which Aphrodite was usually worshipped, as was the Venus (=Aphrodite) of the Porta Collina (cf. Ovid, Fasti 4, 869-870, and cf. I35-I38), whose temple was surrounded at a later date by the horti Sallustianil. This examination of the evidence adduced by SCHILLING and KOCH seems to make it insufficient to establish any view which maintains that the concept of Aphrodite as a vegetation-deity was even present, let alone uppermost, in her cult 8v x4irotg. Flowers and plants in their ornamental, decorative, aesthetic aspect naturally come to be associated with love and its goddess, and gardens containing them are fit places for her worship. This originally Greek idea may lie behind all those pieces of evidence used by WISSOWA classified under (B) above (p. 45I). But this still leaves us with Venus's connec- tion with olera and olitores-quite a different matter-unexplained. I believe that a possible explanation is to be sought in the circumstances of Venus's arrival in Rome-but in a particular quite different from the features which usually attract attention. However much Greek ideas of the various aspects and powers of Aphrodite had already infiltrated and adhered to the originally Roman complex venus-venia-venero(r), there can be no doubt that an enormous impetus was given to the identification of the two goddesses by the introduction into Rome of the cult of Aphrodite of Eryx: the lecti- sternium of 2I7 B. C. after the disaster at Lake Trasimene, and the dedication of the temple of Venus Erycina in 2I5 B. C. Mount Eryx, in north-western Sicily, the highest mountain on the island after Etna, held on its summit a sanctuary of Aphrodite which, according to Polybius I, 55, 7-9, was the richest and most magnificent in Sicily; from here the cult had already made its way to Campania and perhaps further north (cf. LATTE, OP. cit. p. I85, n. 4), and may have been introduced in a rather disguised form even into Latium by the Etruscans (cf. SCHILLING, op. cit. pp. 8o, 246). During the First Punic War, however, after a great deal of local fighting, the mountain was captured by L. Junius in 248 B. C., and the sanctuary on its citadel (although not the town of Eryx lower down) was held continuously by the Romans from that date. This is not the place to examine the repercussions which this event had on the legends of Aphrodite Aineias and the details of Aeneas's nset'n2ovq 1 No composite parallel to this Coan cult seems to have existed in Rome, but the 4uE/uuO,cOcvot recall the aeditui of the horti Sallustiani, which were certainly a pleasure- garden and park and had nothing to do with olitores (for other such Lustgarten see OLCK, RE Art. Gartenbau 827, 831: allusion is made to one at Crotona-enclosing a temple of Aphrodite-by Petronius I26, I2; 127, 8; I28, 4). Aphrodite's connection with baths (for which see S. EITREM, C. R. 37, I923, P. 15) recalls the worship of Fortuna Virilis in the guise of Venus by plebeian women in the men's baths on Ist April (cf. WARDE FOWLER, Roman Festivals, 68 sq.).</page><page sequence="10">Venus and the Cabbage 457 of the Mediterranean. Suffice it to say that the story of Rome's foundation from Troy and Aeneas's goddess mother combined with the opulence and fame of the temple and the joy of the military success to make a great impression on the Roman mind. So the command of the Sibylline Books, consulted in a time of great national fear and crisis at the instigation of Q. Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the grandson of the dedicator of the temple of Venus Obsequens, cf. above p. 45I), that, amongst other things '... . aedes Veneri Erycinae ... vovendas esse' (Livy 22, 9, io), occasions less surprise than it otherwise might. Fabius, in his capacity as dictator, duly vowed the temple on the 23rd April 2I7 B. C., the day of the Vinalia priora. One can imagine the popular excitement which must have been roused as the new temple slowly rose on the Capitol, near the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and in the very place most hallowed by the traditions of the state religion. Speculation about the new goddess, so magnificently welcomed, must have been rife: veterans of the First Punic War who had campaigned in Sicily (including Naevius?) would recall many strange and exotic features of her cult there due to Phoeni- cian influence: naturalisation as a Roman, of course, entailed the loss of many of these (although at her later temple outside the Porta Collina, i.e. extra pomerium-dedicated i8I B. C.-she recovered rather more licence). Never- theless a goddess known to have patronized migrating doves and temple prostitution must have been something of a distasteful enigma to the con- temporaries of Fabius Maximus, even though the original Roman Venus seems to have been a fairly amorphous deity capable of acquiring a surprising range of attributes whose connection with her was by no means obvious at first sight, eventually producing one of the most multiform and many-sided series of cults in the Roman pantheon. Venus's original powers seem to have been extended largely by the fondness of the Romans for folk-etymology, and by the prevalence of the religious idea nomen-omen which sanctioned any identifications made in this way. One of the earliest victims of Venus's assimilative power was none other than Libitina, the goddess of funerals and undertakers. Varro, L. L. 6, 47 says: ab lubendo libido, libidinosus ac Venus Libentina et Libitina. This is not an original etymo- logy of his own; the identification was already known to the age of Calpurnius Piso the historian (frg. I4 PETER = Dion. Hal. 4, 15, 5) and no doubt goes back much further, for a temple of Venus was built in the grove of Libitina hardly later than 300 B. C. (cf. KoCH Op. cit. p. 43). Pliny's chapter on the history of the myrtle (N. H. I5, II9-I2I) gives two other victims: Cloacina, the goddess of sewers '. . . in eo loco quo nunc signa Veneris Cluacinae habet: cluere enim antiqui purgare dicebant', and Murcia, who had lost whatever origi- nal characteristics she miay have had, and had her name mutilated in the process, in order to become 'Venus of the Myrtles': '. . . quin et ara vetus fuit Veneri Myrteae, quam nunc Murciam vocant'. Pliny of course has reversed the</page><page sequence="11">458 P. T. EDEN, Venus and the Cabbage historical order of events - but his remark shows that the name of Murcia at any rate continued to exist. In all probability it was the myrtle-wreath which Aphrodite brought with her from Eryx which so completely overshadow- ed the native deity'. Two facts about the Erycine goddess are unlikely to have escaped popular notice and remark. First, the dedicatory inscription on her new temple, and epigraphic references to her generally, are almost certain to have contained her name in an abbreviated form, just as the pre-Julian calender of Antium under 23rd April has Vener(i) Eruc(inae), and the denarii struck by C. Con- sidius Nonianus about 6o B. C. bear simply the letters ERUC (cf. SCHILLING, op. cit. pp. 249 and 235 with note 4); secondly, Erucina could be the adjectival form not only of Eryx but also of eruca (cf. e.g. ricinus&gt; rica): adjectives of this termination are frequent in plebeian Latin and have given rise to numerous names of divinities (e.g. Libitina) (cf. F. T. COOPER, Word Formation in the Roman Sermo Plebeius, I895, PP. I39 sqq. and esp.I4I). Quantities of vowels and syllables, of course, never stood in the way of any Roman popular etymologist. It is not improbable that the combination of an ill-defined and assimilative Venus with a strange and exotic Aphrodite may well have prepared the way in the popular mind for the conjecture that the new goddess's title had some- thing to do with one of the best known varieties of vegetable, the (brassica) eruca of the cabbage family (it does not grow in northern Europe, but is variously translated by English scholars as 'colewort' or 'rocket', and by German scholars as 'weisser Senf'). If this were so, the development of Venus's patronage to olera in general and olitores would be virtually inevitable. But does anything in Roman cult or culture suggest that any such con- nection between the goddess of love and the eruca was thought to exist? There is in fact abundant evidence to show that the relationship between Venus and the cabbage was at least as intimate as that between any other deity and any other vegetable. For the reputation enjoyed by the eruca as an aphrodisiac is widely attested: it is repeatedly referred to as salax (Priap. 5I, 20, Colum. IO, 372, Ovid. R. A. 799, and [with bulbi] Mart. 3, 75, 3), and its stimulating properties are frequently mentioned (Moret. 86, Priap. 46, 8; 47, 6; Colum. IO, IO9, Pliny, N. H. IO, I82; I4, I54; Juv. 9, I34-I34A rHoUSMAN] and schol. ad loc.; Marcell. med. 33, 50). (The circumstances of the first reference are specially interesting: the poor smallholder Simylus collects the ingredients for his moretum from his garden (no doubt protected by a rough wood figure of Priapus-custos es pauperis horti Ecl. 7. 34) which also grows intibaque et Venerem revocans eruca morantem). 1 Aphrodite's myrtle was also the cause of Venus's assimilation of ovatio (cf. ROHDE, RE Art. Ovatio I897), which may have contributed as much as the memory and hope of military victory to the cult of Venus Victrix in Capitolio (C.I.L.I2 p. 33I) perhaps = Venus Capitolina (MOMMSEN ad loc.) = Venus Erycina.</page><page sequence="12">HERMANN TRXNKLE, Elegisches in Ovids Metamorphosen 459 The point behind Naevius's joke, and the informal festival of the olitores may therefore rest on nothing more than a typically popular Roman love of word-play, which, originating from popular speculation, naturally found no place either in the official state cult, or in the works of theologians, antiquaries, or educated poets like Vergil and Columella, who know only of Priapus as patron-god of horticulture.
