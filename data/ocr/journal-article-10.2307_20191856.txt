<plain_text><page sequence="1">207 Dedication of a Statue for the Egyptian God Tithoes This Egyptian monument was re-discovered in a storeroom at Cornell University. The present edition corrects the physical description of the stone in previous publications and provides new readings of his torical and religious significance, including potential evidence for a sanctuary of Osiris, Tithoes, and Ammon in the area between Coptos and Shenhur. Two joining fragments of a limestone stele, broken on the right; near the bottom the set line is plainly visible in front and the rough-picked back. Evi dently found midway between Coptos and Apollonopolis Parva. Stored once at the Lansing Collection in Cairo (as re ported by Seymour de Ricci, see A.

Kuniholm. Perhaps it belonged to the Goldwin Smith Museum of Casts, but there is no record of its acquisition. E. Bernand, p. 50, connects the inscription with the Brooklyn Mu seum of Art: "Copie de Ch. Edwin Wilbour au Brooklyn Museum." There is no evidence, however, that the document was ever in the Brooklyn Museum; it is not mentioned in S. Tracy &amp; J. Bodel, Greek and Latin Inscriptions in the USA (1997) or K. Herbert, Greek and Latin Inscriptions in the Brooklyn Museum (1972). A. Bernand, p. 230, notes that Charles Edwin Wil bour made, apparently in Egypt, an unpublished copy of the text, preserved in the archive of Seymour de Ricci at the "Insti tut de Papyrologie de la Sorbonne." 3 The square brackets indicate editions not based on autopsy.</page><page sequence="2">208 N.

"For the permanence and the eternal victory of our lords the Emperors Severus, Antoninus, and Geta, PU, Augusti, and of Iulia Domna, mater castrorum, and of their family, when Subatianus was pre fect of Egypt and Iulius Iulianus egregius epistrategos, the statue of our lord Tithoes was dedicated by [...], son of Tbesis, archiereus of the great(est) gods Ofsiris], Tithoes, and Ammon, for the good, [dur ing the magistracy or under the supervision] of the veteran Sarapion, in the 18th year, the 20-29th day of the month Pharmouthi." Epigraphical Commentary The letters, consistent with a third-century date, are clear, somewhat discrepant in size, with lunate shapes consistently employed. Traces of red paint are discernible. 4 last preserved letter: left vertical. 5 'Aie?^cc] might make the line too long, but is a likely conjecture. The damage at the end of the line, where the name of Subatianus starts, looks like an erasure. 8 [A]NAPEAC lapis; last preserved letter: trace of a curve. 9 last preserved letter: clear omicron. Wilbour read a sigma, but the shape and size of the letter match those of most other omicrons in the text, usually smaller than the sigmas. The point where the stone breaks off is a little beyond the middle of the circle, thus showing a bit of its right half. 10 last preserved letter: left vertical. 11 o?ETpavtou: clear rho. 12 The lacuna at the beginning may not have contained a letter. As the break at the end comes immediately after kappa, the date may have had an additional letter. Date The reference to Septimius Severus, Caracalla and Geta indicates a date before February 211, the time of Severus' death (cf. D. Kienast, R?mische Kaisertabelle [1996] 156-157). The eighteenth regnal year must be based on his reign. As he became emperor in June 193, the second year of his reign would be counted in Egypt from 29 August 193. Thus the eighteenth would commence on 29 August (= 1 Thoth). 20 Pharmouthi would be 15 April 210, but since the date is not fully preserved, any of the fol lowing nine days is also possible. Commentary 1. The phrase i&gt;TC?p ?ianovfjc occurs elsewhere in Egypt, e.g. IGRR 1062 and 1181; so does UTc?p a?cov?oi) v?kt|c, e.g. IGRR 1256, OGIS 678. The formula often appears in the variant im?p v?kt|c Kai a?cov?o\) ?iajuovfjc, the latter part of which?a?cov?ou oiajiiovfic?is a rather frequent expression in Roman Imperial documents. 2. Since this monument was inscribed during the reign of Septimius Severus, his name ought to ap pear as well. C?our|p[oi)] then must refer to him, and not to Caracalla; hence the Kai. This form of their names occurs frequently in papyri; for inscriptional evidence, cf., e.g., IGRR 380, 1066. 5. Subatianus Aquila was prefect of Egypt from 205/6 to at least 23 July 210. See G. Bastianini, ZPE 17 (1975) 263-328; ibid. 38 (1980) 75-89; M. Vandoni, Gli epistrategi neVEgitto Greco-Romano</page><page sequence="3">Dedication of a Statue for the Egypian God Tithoes 209 (1970) 37. C[o\)?aTiavS&gt; Aku?xx] might be a bit too long, but is much more frequently attested than the simple Subatianus, which, to our knowledge, occurs only in PSI9, no. 1052. 6. In the list of epistrategoi of the Thebaid compiled by J.D. Thomas, The Epistrategos in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt II (1982) 187 and 198-199, the only one suitable to this document is no. 30, Iulius Iulianus, whom Thomas would date to the late second/early third century (before 212?); cf. P. Oxy. Ill 448. Thomas distinguishes between him and the homonymous epistrategos of the Heptanomia, attested in PSI XII 1248 (235 AD). The two epistrategoi are not differentiated in PIR21 362. On the use of KpcxTicToc, the Greek equivalent to Latin egregius, for epistrategoi, see Thomas, 44-47. Since the end of the first century AD the title vir egregius was regularly applied to officials of the equestrian rank, and widely used in Egypt, "where all the important posts were held by ?quit?s''' (J. Oliver, The Civic Tradi tion and Roman Athens [1983] 126). 7-8. Accepting the reading on the stone as ['A]v?p?ac would make it difficult, if not impossible, to construe the second half of this text. Therefore Cagnat and Jouguet's emendation, ?v?picxc, imposes it self. The orthographical error is trivial, cf. the spelling ocv?pEavTcxpia, attested in papyri (F. Gignac, A Grammar of the Greek Papyri of the Roman and Byzantine Periods I [1976] 252) and the spelling of the name Av?p?ac as Av?piac attested in numerous documents. The use of the word av?piac (instead of ayaA,|ia) is untypical for a statue of a divinity, as A. Ber nand notes. Olaf E. Kaper, The Egyptian God Tutu (2003) 358, note 32, provides an example for a cult statue denoted as av?piac, P. Oxy. XLIX 3473, which has ?v?pidvTEc Atco?Axdvoc, and argues that the use of this word "does not necessarily indicate that it showed the god in human form." However, in our inscription the term may have been used to indicate an anthropomorphic statue, since the three temples in the region of Coptos with images of Tithoes show him in human form, unlike his usual appearance as a sphinx (Kaper, p. 132). The most detailed discussion of Tithoes (Tutu), an apotropaic divinity, often represented as a sphinx, and very popular in Roman Egypt, is provided by Kaper (cf. also D. Frankfurter, Religion in Roman Egypt [1998] 115-116; A. Bernand, op. cit., 234-237; LIMC VIII. 1.32-34). J. Yoyette, BIFAR 55 (1955) 135-138, takes this god to be the personified Lock, and relates the deity to the tradition that Isis, when in Coptos she learned of the death of Osiris, cut off a lock of her hair (Plut., De hide 14): rnv 8' ?kiv a?c0o|i?vr|v KE?pacOai (lev ?vTa?Oa tcov Tc?,oKa|ic?v Eva Kai Tc?v0i|iov cto?t^v avaXa?Eiv, OTcou xr\ tco?,?i |LiE%pi v?v ovojia KoTCTcb.4 Although this episode's value as evidence is controversial, there is no doubt that Tutu, addressed as "the great god residing in Coptos, master of all lands" (Kaper, R-24) was especially honored there. Kaper, pp. 132-136, discusses the evidence for his cult in the re gion of Coptos, and especially the three temples that depicted Tutu in their reliefs. The provenance of the present inscription adds to the connection between Coptos and Tithoes, whose cult is also attested in an important monument from Coptos, A. Bernand, op. cit., no. 83 (Kaper, no. S-l). It represents a rec tangular stele of the Roman period, with an elaborate relief of Tutu as a sphinx, and an inscription on the base, referring to a cultic society (synodos) of Tithoes, as well as to his archiereus. The document calls Tithoes 0?oc Ajijucovioc, thus suggesting that Tithoes and Ammon were related in cult, as is appar ent also from line 10 of the present document. They were also depicted together, see Kaper, no. S-56 (cf. infra, ad line 9). 9. The more frequent genitive of the feminine name T?^cic is T?r|cioc, well attested in Egypt. T?rj c?coc occurs in Sammelbuch I 1183. Listing the mother's instead of the father's name is a common phenomenon in Egyptian documents. 4 See also H. Youtie's discussion of documentary evidence for the cult of "Isis of the hair" in ?Icic Tpi%cbuxxToc", HTR 39 (1946) 165-67 (Youtie, Scriptiunculae I (1973) 483-85). J.G. Griffiths, however, (Plutarch's De hide et Osiride, Cam bridge, 1970, 314-315) points out that the cutting of the lock was not an Egyptian, but a Greek tradition. Yet, as he discusses in detail, Isis had a prominent cult in Coptos, with various references to her hair.</page><page sequence="4">210 N. Dimitrova-K. Clinton The omicron, omitted by previous editors,5 must be the beginning of a deity's name. Osiris makes good sense, especially in view of the Isis episode quoted above and the lack of suitable alternatives. 'O[dp?coc vel -cipi?oc Kai] seems syntactically preferable than the simple 'O[cip?coc vel -cipi?oc], and is certainly possible, though perhaps a bit too long, since it would make the line consist of 33/34 letters. The number of letters per line is ca. 30; it ranges between 27 (line 4) and 34 (line 5, if we accept the restoration C[oi)?aTiavn 'Aku?xx]). An association, though not a clear cultic connection, between Osiris and Tutu is found in art: at least 2 (and perhaps 3) monuments show them together, see Kaper, nos. S-2?, S-54, S-56 (for a discussion of Osiris in the latter see p. 111). As mentioned above, S-56 shows also Ammon alongside Tutu. This stele was found at Behbeit el-Hagar, parallel to Coptos in terms of its religion, as emphasized by Kaper re garding the liaison between Ammon and Tutu (p. Ill, with note 20; p. 136). Moreover, the temple in Shenhur, located in the region of Coptos, halfway between Coptos and Thebes, portrays, among other gods, Osiris and Ammon on its northern wall, and Tutu on the eastern wall (Kaper, pp. 132-133). If the restoration of the name of Osiris is correct, as seems likely, then this would provide the first documen tary example of Osiris, Ammon, and Tutu's joint worship in the region of Coptos. Kaper, p. 136, argues, on the basis of the present inscription, that the joint priesthood of Ammon and Tithoes suggests the ex istence of a separate shrine for Amon and Tutu in the area between Shenhur and Coptos at the end of the second century A.D. The new reading at the end of line 9, however, would refer to a separate shrine and high priest of Osiris (probably), Tutu, and Ammon. 10. Tithoes and Ammon are frequently called "great" or "greatest" gods, hence the restoration; cf. Kaper, M-15, R-24, S-l, S-63; Bernand, Fayoum II no. 124; idem, Akoris nos. 2, 7, etc. 11-12. The veteran Sarapion was either a magistrate on duty, as assumed in previous editions, or assisted in some capacity and perhaps oversaw the operation. ?TU|Li?^r|T?X)]lovTOc is possible; and so is [apx]ovTOc, suggested by A. Bernand, but it should be divided [ap]l[%]ovToc, since at most one letter can fit at the beginning of line 12. Cornell University Nora Dimitrova Kevin Clinton 5 Wilbour's copy has a lunate sigma at the end, which can be interpreted as a broken omicron. Sayce notes two missing letters, but all following editors have printed nothing.</page></plain_text>
