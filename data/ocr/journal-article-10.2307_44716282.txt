Clemens Anatomisches Institut der Freien Universität Berlin K. Burow Institut für Kraftfahrzeuge der Technischen Universität Berlin THE VULNERABILITY of cervical-spine trauma increases in traffic accidents. Until now a large number of researchers have reported their results in the field of spinal trauma, in particular "whiplash injury." The analysis of these injuries is very difficult as there are no sufficient biomechanical data avail- able. We have therefore developed a special testing device that allows execution of simulations of vehicle accidents with human torsos in order to estimate the necessary biomechanical information. This investigation should give us better knowledge of the dynamic response of the head-neck system, and we tried to find the physiological limits of the material that led to light injuries, severe traumas, or even fatal injuries. During our experiments, we had some doubts about the exact head weights of dummies in the literature, because the definition of them was not precise and seemed to us high in comparison with the head weights of men. We therefore carried out further investigations to estimate the head weights of adult men (1)*. The resulting fact was that the average weight of the head of an adult male ranges from 3800-4100 g. There is a distinct difference of 1000 g between the weights of the dummy head and the actual head of adult men. Naturally, this fact has to be considered in research with dummies. The torsos of older people were used in this investigation. In practice, there are quite a number of old people, as drivers, as passengers, and as pedestrians, represented in traffic, and they are naturally involved in traffic accidents. For a more general interpretation of the results, one has to consider the findings of Marotzky (2, 3) concerning the isometric measure- ments of the forces at the head-neck system with living younger and older people (Figs. 1 and 2).

ABSTRACT This paper discusses the results of simulated head-on and rear-front vehicle crashes employing 53 human torsos. Mea- surements of deceleration of the head were taken, and the resulting injuries were noted. The most common and serious injury was to the cervical spine at the sixth vertebra. It is suggested that vehicle restraint systems be developed to avoid such injury, such as safety belts that would limit anteflexion of the head, airbags for head-on crash protection, and seat backs with integrated headrests to support the head at the e.g. 2779</page><page sequence="2">2780 H.

Upper cervical spine: base of the skull, atlas, axis, and intervertebral disc between C2 and C3. 2. Middle cervical spine: vertebrae C3 and C4, intervertebral discs C3/C4 and C4/C5. 3. Lower cervical spine: vertebrae C5, C6, and C7, inter- vertebral discs C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/C1. CRASH SIMULATOR FOR HEAD-NECK INVESTIGATIONS TESTING OBJECTS - The objects tested were a small number of complete human torsos, but mostly muscle-bone- tissue préparâtes (Fig. 3). In all cases, the objects (a total of 53) were fresh unembalmed cadavers. The tests were carried out one or two days after death, always after rigor mortis set in. Half of them were females and half males, the ages being 50-90 years, the average age about 70 years. If possible, a strap with accelerometers was fixed at the head (the same device had been used in sled tests with volunteers Fig. 3 - Rear view of mounted torso with fixations and accelerometer carrier plate on head conducted at the Institute of Automobile Engineering); if not possible, the skull of the préparâtes was removed, except the skull base on which a spherical wooden measuring head with accelerometers was mounted (Fig. 4). The test objects were separated at the 10th thoracic vertebra from the lower part of the body so they could be mounted to a rigid plate in order to avoid uncontrolled movements of the lumbar spine and the pelvis. Thus, the test conditions became more reproducible and were concentrated on the head-neck system. Before and after the tests, an extended x-ray control was conducted. After the tests the torsos were examined macro- scopically and dissected, and the results were recorded photographically. TEST EQUIPMENT - The test equipment consists of two upright standing iron box sections on which T-shaped beams are welded, which comprise the rail assemblies. On these T-sections runs a 50 X 50 cm sled supported and guided by</page><page sequence="3">INJURY MECHANISMS OF CERVICAL SPINE 278 1 Fig. 4 - Carrier plate with accelerometers and spherically shaped human head Fig. 5 - Test equipment with sled and measuring instruments eight nylon wheels. The sled can be lifted by means of a rope to the defined height and is released by a cable (Fig. 5). The maximum fall height is 3.40 m with a resulting speed of 8 m/s. Because of the minimal friction (about ION), the fall can be regarded as a free one. The sled is decelerated by deforming steel sheets, so the stopping distance and the deceleration can be chosen in a wide range; the maximum stopping distance is 0.55 m. The alloy plate that carries the test objects can be mounted on the sled in various positions to vary the impact direction. At the beginning of the test, the head is held in normal posi- tion and simultaneously released with the sled in order not to interfere with the head movement. The forward flexion (anteflexion) has been limited by a "styropor" block simulat- ing the chin striking the chest. The following quantities were measured as a function of time by accelerometers and motion pictures. 1. bs(t) - deceleration of the sled. 2. bkc(t) - cranial (vertical) deceleration of the head. 3. bkf(t) - facial (horizontal) deceleration of the head. 4. a(t) - rotation of the head at first cervical vertebra. 5. ā (t) - rotational deceleration of the head. 6. a (t) - inclination angle of the torso to the vertical line. 7. v§(t) - impact speed of the sled (calculated from fall height). 8. bres(t) - resulting deceleration of the head (calculated from bkc and bkf). The data were guided by cables to strain-gage measuring bridges and registered by oscillograph. After that the data were stored via line-follower on computer magnetic tape for easier analysis. Motion pictures were taken with 64-250 frames/s.</page><page sequence="4">2782 H. J. CLEMENS AND K.

Torso with great inclination and less flexion of neck (test 20, test speed vs = 8.05 m/s) ANTEFLEXION AT FRONTAL CAR CRASHES (TESTS 7-26) The movements of the car occupant during a car crash depend upon the design of the compartment and the built-in restraint systems. The lap and shoulder safety belt nowadays is the best restraint system (4), but its value is limited with higher-impact speeds by compression fractures at the chest, clavical fractures, and also whiplash injuries of the cervical column (extended anteflexion with following retroflexion). The typical motions and loads were simulated in a test series. Test speed for all tests was vs = 8 m/s (26 ft/s). The decelera- tion distance and limitation of anteflexion angle was varied. MOTION SEQUENCE ANALYSIS - The motion sequence of the forced anteflexion has been described in the literature (5, 6) as a primary main translation with following rotation plus translation. Rotation comprises two main axes: the first at the base of the cranium (at C 1 ) and the second at the sixth cervical vertebra (C6). The limitation of this motion in nature is the bounce of the chin to the thorax in the tests by striking the styropor block. Fig. 6 shows the deceleration as a function of time for a typical test. The analysis of the deceleration-time functions of the head results in two phases, in which two distinct maxima of the deceleration were marked. The first phase of motion is caused only by slipping of one vertebra on the other. There is no doubt that, in general, the amplitudes of cervical column motions of older people will be less due to the degeneration of vertebrae with age. Figs. 7-10 show the motion pictures of the tests.</page><page sequence="6">2784 H. J. CLEMENS AND K. BUROW Fig. 9 - Whiplash by retroflexion without headrest; flexion of neck around backrest (test 31, test speed = 6.3 m/s) The increase of the cranial head deceleration starts 6-10 ms after beginning of the sled deceleration (Fig. 6); that is, up to this moment, the head moves by reason of elasticities in the body mainly straight ahead and not being decelerated. There- after, the head moves undecelerated rotationally until the horizontal head deceleration rises. The horizontal deceleration in any case starts after the vertical one, whereby the average time difference is 10 ms. The influence of the inclination of the torso on the motion sequence of rotation and translation phase cannot be explained through the diagram, even if such a supposition were well founded. During the following phase I, the head is decelerated only by means of the friction between the vertebrae and by extension of the muscles and tissues. Seventy to eighty milliseconds after the impact, a minimum of the head deceleration can be seen corresponding to a head angle of approximately a = 45 deg. The so-called phase II describes the bounce of the torso's head on the breast (styropor blocks). According to the type of bounce, different types of movements (for example, retroflexion of the neck) will take place, sometimes hardly comparable to the natural occurrence, and it is hard to control this movement with this test device. Therefore, the exact analysis of this phase had to be postponed. In the tests, the maximum angle of anteflexion is 90 deg (Fig. 11). Tarriere and Sapin state 76 deg for anteflexion in tests with volunteers, but they also cite other literature with 130 deg for anteflexion and 150 deg for retroflexion. An extensive retroflexion with angles up to 110 deg follows the anteflexion. It still has to be ascertained how much this extension corresponds to that in reality. In sled tests with volunteers (7-9) at test speeds up to 8 m/s, this heavy retro- flexion could not be observed, but on the other hand, it</page><page sequence="7">INJURY MECHANISMS OF CERVICAL SPINE 2785 Fig. 10 - Whiplash by retroflexion with headrest (test 43, test speed = 7.0 m/s) Fig. 1 1 - Time function of head rotation and torso inclination for anteflexion</page><page sequence="8">2786 H. J. CLEMENS AND K. BUROW Fig. 12 - Time functions of test data for anteflexion with great torso inclination Fig. 13 - Max head deceleration as function of sled deceleration for anteflexion corresponds with the results of numerous dummy tests with lap and shoulder safety belts, in which the neck moments and forces were often found greater in the phase of retroflexion than in anteflexion. Fundamentally, these great angles of retroflexion can result, and this has been proved by the tests of Hinz (10). Decelera- tions during this phase II are obviously lower than in the anteflexion phase, but the kinds of injuries during this phase lead to the conclusion that this phase is the more serious one. ANALYSIS OF HIGH-SPEED PICTURES - Besides the above-mentioned sequence of two phases, the analysis of the motion pictures shows two different types of reaction of the torsos during the impact that also may be observed in a car crash with vehicle occupants. Type A shows that the torso remains upright in the originally fixed attitude (Fig. 12). The shoulder part of the torso moves forward in the direction of the motion as a result of the body's elasticity. During this phase, the head moves un- decelerated in the same direction, and this is noticed in the absence of cranial head deceleration (Fig. 6). The point of the maximum inclination of the thorax indicates the beginning of the neck's flexion and the rotation of the head. The flexion of the neck mainly occurs in the region of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, whereas rotation of the head takes place at CI. This observation justifies the use of a model for simulation that consists of an elastic bar with joints at CI and C6 or C7. In type B, the sternum is more or less fractured (Fig. 13). This results in a greater forward inclination of the torso and could be described as a rotation around the lowest existing vertebra (TH 10 for the test objects). This effect makes a shorter phase of translation compared with type A, and a significant extension of the neck, which means a minor flexion (Fig. 12). Compared with real vehicle accidents, type A corresponds to an occupant rigidly fixed with lap and shoulder belts without an energy-absorber. Type B may be regarded as the flexion at the lumbar spine for a car occupant who is secured by a lap belt only or additionally with a shoulder belt with an energy- absorber. In both cases, the loads on the cervical column may differ. IMPACT LOADS - Figs. 13 and 14 show the maximum values of measured decelerations as a function of the maximum sled deceleration for both phase I and II.

An increase of sled deceleration results in an increasing</page><page sequence="9">INJURY MECHANISMS OF CERVICAL SPINE 2787 Fig. 14 - Resulting head decelerations and Gadd-SI for anteflexion Fig. 15 - Time delays of head deceleration after impact horizontal head deceleration, whereas such a dependency cannot be stated for the vertical head deceleration. During phase I, the horizontal deceleration is approximately 15 g. Only by extension of the tissues and other components of the neck, can the head be decelerated in such an extension. This seems to be a relatively high value compared with the 2-3 g deceleration said to be the maximum value during neck retroflexion. The vertical load represents the tension in the longitudinal axis of the cervical column. Cranial (vertical) acceleration has an average value of 40-50 g. With a head mass of approxi- mately 4000 g (without cervical spine), this results in a trac- tion force at CI of 1600-2000 N (350-440 lb). There is no clear statement about fatality of those forces; we have ob- served several ring fractures at the cranium in our investiga- tions. They could have had their origin in the impact on the styropor block. However, in test 15, there had been registered a complete separation of the head with ring fracture, doubt- less during phase I (b^ = 37 g, b^.^ = 40 g). Consequently, this ring fracture can only be considered as a fracture by traction. Additionally, the Gadd Severity Index (SI) has been de- termined from the resulting head deceleration By definition, it is valid for the impact against a plane, unyielding surface. But nevertheless it is sometimes erroneously used in literature for evaluation with indirect traumatization of the head-neck system (safety belts, airbag). The results of our tests give two cases with an SI - 1000 but below the limit of 1200, which is given for resulting head decelerations. How- ever, most SI values are 500-700, corresponding with severe injuries of the cervical column. This documents that the SI should only be used the way it has been defined, but not for indirect traumatization of the head-neck system. This statement even does not lose its value by the fact that single structures in vivo have a greater loading capacity than in cadavers. VULNERABILITY (TABLES 1 AND 2) - During the sling motions forward (anteflexion at frontal impacts) with follow- ing retroflexion, there are fissures or ruptures of the inter- vertebral discs, the anterior and posterior longitudinal liga- ments, the flava ligaments, and the joint capsules and fractures (Table 1). The lightest injury has been the isolated fissure or rupture of the intervertebral discs, the most severe one a complete avulsion of the head. Damages of the intervertebral discs were found in 80%, followed by fractures (75%), rup- tures of the joint capsules (50%), ruptures of the ligamental</page><page sequence="10">2788 H. J.

The accident injuries at frontal impact (sling motion for- ward) are concentrated on the lower cervical spine (46.7%), especially at C5/C6. The upper cervical spine follows with 21.2%, especially at C1/C2. The middle cervical spine is affected within 14.1%. The issued insults are classified after the modified Automobile Crash Injury Research (ACIR) scale (1 1-15) as dangerous (degree 3), and in most of the cases as fatal (degree 4). A lower limit of maximum load causing no injuries could not be found in this investigation.

It is considered very serious for the crash victim. Therefore, there has been another test series carried out with and without headrests. TESTS WITHOUT HEADREST (TESTS 29-40, 46-49) - Simulating the retroflexion in front-rear crashes, 16 tests were carried out without any headrest. A steel backrest with foam upholstery was mounted to support the torsos. It was ad- justable in vertical and longitudinal direction and was fixed so that the torso was pressed slightly against the rest, and the shoulder agreed in height with the backrest. However, for several very small torsos, the height of the backrest was about 5 cm over shoulder height. Except with the backrest, the torsos were only fixated by x-shaped shoulder belts to the mounting plate, where there was no fixation of the breast- bone and vertebral column. Test speed varied within 19-25 km/h, whereby decelerations of the sled were 13-16 g. MOTION SEQUENCE - Fig. 9 shows a typical sequence of a test without a headrest; corresponding deceleration-time functions can be seen in Fig. 16. Analysis of both gives the following kinematics of whiplash. After impact, there is a relatively long period of translation for the whole torso, caused by the compressibility of the upholstery of the backrest and the torso itself. As the back of the torso is decelerated first, a relative movement between head and torso results. The motion pictures clearly show the flexion of the neck in the lower regions of the cervical column, whereas a rotation of the head cannot be seen. This period of translation movement lasts for about 30-40 ms and leads to the rotation of the head, whose axis is at first at C6</page><page sequence="12">2790 H. J. CLEMENS AND K. BUROW Fig. 17 - Max head deceleration for retroflexion as function of sled deceleration Fig. 18 - Time function of head rotation for retroflexion (as seen on the pictures) together with the axis of the neck's flexion. Facial decelerations in this period are of minor value except tests 33 and 40, which have to be analyzed more exactly later on (Fig. 17). The maximum of the vertical (cranial) head deceleration is about 70-80 ms after impact, due to a head angle of about a = 40-45 deg. Even during this period, there is no horizontal deceleration worth mentioning. Typical time functions of head angles are shown in Fig. 18. Compared with the time functions of the anteflexion, there is a later but more rapid rise of the head angle for retroflexion with the result that the maximum of head angles is reached at the same time after the impact's beginning. At the end of the retroflexion, after the bounce of the cranium on the backside of the backrest, the maximum head angle is about 110 deg from normal head position (Fig. 14). Now the reversal of the head-neck flexion happens. With no temporal independence to the neck's flexion, the decompres- sion phase of the thorax and of the backrest occurs, which means the thorax springs back before the head angle reaches its maximum. The swinging back of the head in its normal position is a relatively slow and steady motion; the head swings forward by anteflexion with a maximum position at 250 ms after beginning of impact with an angle of about 45 deg. The motion ends with a damped oscillation. IMPACT LOADS - Regarding the time functions of the decelerations (Fig. 17), the most interesting is the lack of greater horizontal (facial) deceleration during the retroflexion phase. Most values are even negative, meaning the head is accelerated in cranial direction with maximum values of 1-6 g. The positive deceleration values of the other tests also show peaks of 1-6 g. With an average total head weight of 3200-4000 g, there is only by extension of tissues and muscles a restraint force of 40-250 N (9-55 lb). These values correspond with data mentioned in the literature. Because of the low test speeds, there are less centrifugal forces, and the maximum of cranial deceleration is 20-36 g depending upon the test velocity. Greater horizontal (facial) decelerations are measured while the head bounces on the upholstery. Vertical (cranial) de- celeration is relatively low during this period. Acceleration is not significant while swinging back to normal position and the following anteflexion. VULNERABILITY - Fissues or ruptures of the interverte- bral discs, injuries of the ligaments, ruptures of the joint capsules, and fractures occur during sling motion backward (Tables 4-6).

Damage of the intervertebral discs was found in 90% fol- lowed by ruptures of the ligamentum longitudinalis anterior (80%), ruptures of the joint capsules (40%), fractures of the bones (30%), and ruptures of the ligamenta flava (10%) and ligamentum longitudinalis posterior (10%). The following fractures were noted: fractures of the vertebral bodies (pos- terior part) three times, those of the processus of the spine one time (dislocated). All injuries are classified according the modified ACIR scale as dangerous (degree 3), and in some cases as fatal (degree 4). The accident injuries during front-rear impacts (slingback) are mainly concentrated on the lower cervical spine, espe- cially at C5/C6 and C6/C7. In the middle cervical spine, only ruptures of the intervertebral discs could be found, while the upper cervical spine was hardly affected- except for two rup- tures of the joint capsules and one luxation. In an additional series of tests (tests 37, 39, 40, 47, 48), testing speed was reduced from 25 km/h (25 ft/s) to 19-20 km/h (19-20 ft/s). The sled deceleration dropped from 16 to 13-15 g (for further technical details, see Table 6). In this set, none of the objects were injured in the region of the cervical column. So an exact limit of vulnerability was found. TESTS WITH HEADREST (RETROFLEXION) (TESTS 4145) To compare the above while using a headrest, five additional tests were carried out. The headrest was made from a 25 X 5 cm planed board upholstered with 4 cm foam rubber. The headrest was adjustable in vertical and horizontal directions in order to get a "normal" head position and to support the head's e.g. to avoid any movements by an eccentric support. The test speed now was 25 km/h in order to compare the re- sults with those of the tests without headrests, where fatal in- juries could be observed.

This translation is in the thoracic region more than in the head region, while there is a difference between deformations of the backrest and upholstery of the headrest. This initiates a relative motion between the head and thorax, which results in a slight anteflexion of the neck. There is some head deceleration at the beginning, about 5-8 ms after impact, and vertical deceleration rises about 5 ms before the horizontal. Time functions are shown in Fig. 19.</page><page sequence="15">INJURY MECHANISMS OF CERVICAL SPINE 2793 First by the above-mentioned relative motion, then by an eccentric support of the head, a momentum with C 1 as center of rotation is caused. It can then be seen in some tests that the unsupported cervical column is bent like an elastic bar under load, initiating a rotation of the head. The rapid rise of the horizontal deceleration is remarkable, increasing propor- tionally to the deceleration of the sled from 20 to 40 g. A second motion period follows the elastic deformations, while the thorax and the head are displaced forward. The mo- tions of the trunk and head do not run synchronously. The decelerations during this period are low (maximum 2-3 g). The neck incurs a slow anteflexion and then falls back on the headrest. Compared with the tests without a headrest, all de- celerations really are lower and not dangerous. No injuries were found. CONCLUSIONS The vulnerability of a motion segment by indirect force ac- tion (whiplash injuries) follows a definite mechanism (13-24). There is a fundamental difference between injuries by ante- flexion and those by retroflexion. A certain combination of injuries allows a discussion of the degree of damage and its mechanism. Therefore, authors have tried to find a classifica- tion of injuries of the head-neck system (13-16, 25, 26). Under certain circumstances, those classifications might be applied in cases with direct force action to the head-neck sys- tem, providing that the head and the neck can move unhind- ered and that the direction of force is not too cephalocaudal. INJURY DEGREE I - The first degree of injuries is marked through isolated intervertebral disc injuries without contem- poraneous injuries of the ligaments and bones. This is valid for the mechanism of anteflexion as well as of retroflexion. Also, lateral fissures of the intervertebral discs toward the nucleus pulposus and total cross ruptures could be found. These fissures are not to be confused with natural degeneration of the intervertebral discs. Bleeding and clear structure sep- arations marked the difference in anatomical preparations. Anteflexion and retroflexion injuries differ in the direction of vulnerability. The incomplete fissures lie on different sides. By anteflexion, the incomplete fissures of the intervertebral discs appear dorsal from the nucleus pulposus, while by retro- flexion, they appear ventral of them. The injuries always oc- cur on this side of intervertebral discs, which suffer from the higher traction load; that is, on the higher end of the wedge. It is uncertain whether the fissure arises from the nucleus pulposus or the annulus fibrosus. However, it seems more possible that the longitudinal load at the border of the inter- vertebral discs is not as high as the pressure on the jelly nucle- us. Therefore, it results in an explosion of the annulus fibro- sus from the inside (27-30). A lateral prolapse beside the intact ligaments is possible, but was not observed. A prolapse can narrow the vertebral chan- nel if the dorsal part of the intervertebral disc is ruptured. Furthermore, nerve compressions are possible. These trauma- tizations are therefore termed dangerous. Also, there is an in- jury of one or more intervertebral discs possible. During in- tensive anteflexion, one can find the injury center at C5/C6 followed by C6/C7; during retroflexion at C6/C7. INJURY DEGREE II - The anteflexion mechanism is charac- terized by a high load of the dorsal ligaments because of an extreme separation from the spines and vertebral arches (31). Besides the damage to intervertebral discs, we find ruptures of the interspinal ligament, the flava ligaments, and the joint capsules, but no rupture of the posterior longitudinal liga- ment. In this stage, we see single bone fractures (articular processes, vertebral arch, transverse processes). A reversible translatory slipping of the cranial vertebral body (subluxation) is possible and probable (32). The center of in- juries lies at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. During an extreme retroflexion, we regularly find an injury (fissure or rupture) of the anterior longitudinal ligament besides the damage to the intervertebral discs. Damage to bones such as teardrop fractures, separations at the top of vertebrae, or rup- tures of joint capsules are also possible in the context of rup- tures of ligaments. They mostly are at C6/C7 or C5/C6. INJURY DEGREE III - During anteflexion, it can now be theoretically expected that ruptures of the ligamentum longi- tudinalis posterior will occur. However, our experimental findings show in this phase a rupture of the anterior longitu- dinal ligament. This might have been explained by the presence of elastic fibers in the ligamentum longitudinalis posterior (33), and this fact would also explain a higher resistance of this ligament against tension. Following biomechanics, the rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament is only possible after reverse of the maximum anteflexion to the initial position. We therefore estimate this point as the critical phase for this event. Luxa- tions in the small vertebral joints, ruptures of the joint cap- sules, teardrop fractures, and fractures of the articular and transversal processes are as regular as fractures of the vertebral bodies and arches. The center of injuries is situated in the lower cervical spine near the sixth cervical vertebra. The number of injured intervertebral discs increases. Ring fractures of the os occipitale around the foramen occipitale by traction forces will happen. The vulnerability in the region of C1/C2 increases. During retroflexion, the posterior longitudinal ligament will detach from the backside of the vertebral body, but a rupture of this ligament is very rare. A fracture of the spine, the arch, or the articular process and a fracture of the backside of the vertebra in this phase is very plausible due to the extreme flexibility. Once more, the center of injury is near the sixth cervical vertebra. The number of injured intervertebral discs also increases. INJURY DEGREE IV - In both cases (anteflexion and retroflexion), this stage corresponds with the complete disconnection of the neck. Again, it is remarkable that the posterior longitudinal ligament has seldom been ruptured. There is usually a detachment of the ligament from the back- side of the vertebral body. With a maximum of anteflexion, total avulsion of the head is possible (23, 24). TECHNICAL CONSEQUENCES - The analysis of the kinematics of the head-neck system confirmed the motion</page><page sequence="16">2794 H. J. CLEMENS AND K. BUROW sequence described in the literature- a pure translation of head and neck at first is followed by a rotation of the head with its axis at CI , the neck bending like a bar with joints at CI and C6. The concentration of the impact injuries around C6, however, leads to the conclusion that the instantaneous center lies in this sector and not at C7, as previously presumed. This makes correction of the models for mathematical simulation necessary. The resultant head decelerations and SI are below the limits demanded until now, even for those tests with fatal injuries. This means that these tolerance limits for direct impact loads are not valid for indirect forces on the head. In this case, the forces and moments acting directly within the cervical column (traction and shear forces) have to be measured or calculated. In the first phase of flexion, the head was decelerated with an average value of 1 5 g, which means that the structures of the neck can endure a restraint force of 600-700 N (130- 155 lb). Traction fractures and even a totally disrupted cervical column above CI resulted from traction forces of 1600-2200 N (350-500 lb). The tests make clear that whiplash injuries are dangerous in frontal car crashes even with safety belts. The safety belts have to be improved to get a symmetrical support of the crash victim in order to avoid combined loads by torsion and flexion. To reduce anteflexion of the neck, the safety belts have to be improved by installment of shock absorbers to get a well- defined displacement of the upper trunk. Thereby the flexion of the lumbar spine has to be limited; otherwise, the analog in- juries would appear in this part of the vertebral column. For higher velocities, restraint systems have to be developed that have an additional support for the head (for example, the head belt in the Sigma racing car study) or that avoid flexion of the neck by support on a great area (airbag). From the fact that injuries occur at the frontal tissues of the cervical column in anteflexion, there is a further demand for a headrest to avoid retroflexion, which seems also to be the more critical phase in frontal impacts. The tests for retroflexion confirmed that the passive restraint forces by elongation of the muscle and tissue systems are extraordinarily low. The horizontal decelerations in the flexion phase have a maximum value of 6 g. That means that for a head mass of 3.2-4 kg and an additional weight of 0.8-1 .0 kg for the cervical column, a restraint force of 25-30 kp (50-70 lb) can be brought up. The measured deceleration demonstrates that the traction and shear forces are the dangerous limitations for the cervical column instead of the deceleration at the head. From the test results, it can be seen that front-end crashes with impact speeds of 25 km/h and acceleration of 15 g can lead to dangerous and fatal injuries of the cervical spine. These can be absolutely avoided by a suitable headrest. The analysis of the motion sequence assists the demand for headrests that support the head in its e.g. On the other hand, the neck should also be supported to avoid the flexion of the neck between the headrest and backrest, especially for long necks (2, 3). This support can be reached by a suitable shape of headrest (such as in the Saab) or by its integration into the backrest. SUMMARY Simulated vehicle crashes (head-on and rear-front crashes) were carried out with 53 male and female free-falling human torsos of various ages. Measurements were taken on the translational and rotational decelerations of the torsos heads as well as of test speed and sled deceleration. Precise con- trols of the torsos were made by x-rays before as well as after the impacts. After the experiments, each torso was inspected macroscopically and dissected. In most cases, frozen sections a few millimetres in thickness were made. Pictures of the impact injuries were taken by photography and x-rays, and the findings were correlated with the technical data recorded by oscillographs. The sagittal rotation during anteflexion took place in the lower part of the cervical spine at the sixth vertebra; rotation of the head was at CI . In these areas, the injuries are con- centrated that have to be regarded as dangerous, mostly even as fatal, according to the ACIR injury scale. The sagittal rotation during retroflexion also took place in the lower part of the cervical spine at C6. All injuries that could be found in the retroflexion tests without head- rests (dangerous to fatal) could totally be avoided by mounting a headrest at the height of the head's e.g. The morphological findings demand the construction of vehicle occupant restraint systems that minimize flexion of the cervical spine to a tolerable degree, safety belts with a force limitation that allows a defined displacement of the upper torso in order to limit anteflexion of the head, an airbag for head-on crashes, and seat backs with integrated headrests that are high enough to support the head right at the e.g. Our model description (8) that says that the neck can be regarded as an elastic bar with joints at C6 and CI has been verified by the analysis of the technical and biological data. The measured loads of the anteflexion tests cannot be regarded as tolerance limits since none of the torsos tested sustained no injuries. The measured loads of the retroflexion tests can be re- garded as well-defined tolerance limits since there were two groups of tests with only slightly differing impact conditions. In one group, injuries appeared in each case, whereas in the other group not one was found (with tolerance limits of: speed difference &lt; 25 km/h, body deceleration &lt; 15 g). Further statements on the forces within the cervical spine as a reaction to the measured head decelerations cannot be made at present. This will be done with the help of an analog simulation by a mathematical model. REFERENCES 1 . H. J. Clemens, "Das Kopfgewicht des Menschen, ein biomechanisches Problem." Arch, orthop.
