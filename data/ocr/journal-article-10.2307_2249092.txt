The psychologist can ' analyse out' his 'sensations' only for this reason, viz., because the sensation-qualities of objects are not practical cues, and " there is no sort of behaviour which is demanded by blue objects, or by objects which feel ' cold' or taste 'sour'." However in perception " the properties of the complex are not conceivable as resultants or products of the joint activity of the constituent sensations," and " no scientific doctrine was more futile or barren of results than this doctrine that the percept is a complex of sensations ". The truth is that 'sensation' is " nothing rnore nor less than an hypostatized quality," and that " the same objective stimuli are being responded to differently" when we perceive or analyse out sensations. Moreover all responses are never to a single stimulus but always to a situation. These results have an important bearing on the notions of psychological 'analysis' and in- trospection, and on the problem of meaning.] P. Hughes. 'The Two Poles of the Philosophical Sphere.'

Hence " economic~ laws are statements, not of what men plan, nor even of what they desire, to do, but of what actually happens as the result of their actions ". But "the economic relation is being constantly transformed in the direction of moral obligation by the simple fact of consciousness of the relation. Here, too, " when we discover a law of human nature, we are, by the very fact of discovery, placed in a position to say whether the law is to, contirnue to prevail-the dominion of the law is dissolved by the con- sciousness of the law ". This is strikingly illustrated by the discovery of the Malthusian law of population which " began to lose its force as soon as it was formulated and precisely as the result of being formulated."J F.

"But the mathematician is not a fatalist, and his procedure has the elemnent of safety that if he does not like the conclusions, he is at liberty to change the assumptions." It is then shown that relativity rests on the assumption that " the observed. velocity of light is always constant, independent of the motion of the observer and the source of light ". This is of course arbitrary, but it entails a change in the meaning of 'miles' and 'second' in the formula. for the velocity of light, which " do not have their old meaning if one is, in motion, but return to it if one returns to rest".] E.

Barclay. 'The Hague Court of Arbitration.' [Since 'to sneer at . . . international law generally because the most terrible war the world has ever seen has broken out in spite of it is just about as reasonable as to sneer at . . . the science of building generally because an earthquake has destroyed some of man's finest work,' the author proposes 'to assert the unqualified conservation and operativeness of International Law, of Arbitration as established by the Hague conven- tions and by treaties between and with our allies and with neutrals, and of the Hague Court, just as they stood before the war, in spite of viola- tions on all hands by belligerents of almost every rule which had been laid down by Statesmen and Jurists for the humanising, so far as it can be made humane, of so insensate a survival of barbarism as war.' The point of the article seems to be expressed by the author's words: ' In none of the wars which have been waged since the Hague Court was instituted, has there been any possibility of recourse to it. It is and remains a Court for the determination of cases in which there are disputed questions of right and damages, questions in which rules of law and justice are applicable, and in which the parties seek, in good faith, an 25</page><page sequence="6">378 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. honest solution. And in spite of all the wars which have disgraced the present generation of mankind, its power, utility, and authority, as at present constituted, stand undiminished.' Finally, the author expresses some pious lhopes of the evolution, ' out of the Hague Court and its further developinents, of some super-judicial institution,' and so on. 'Yet we must not let ourselves be deluded by any extravagant hopes.' Possibly the reviewer may be allowed to remark that the science of building seems to have a much closer connexion with earthquakes than the author thinks the Hague Court has with war: it would seem to be more to the point to say that to sneer at the Hague Court would be just about as sensible as to sneer at a well-conducted and useful cookery class for not departing from its proper sphere so far as to prevent earthquakes happen- ing. It is surely part of the business of the science of building to take possible earthquakes into account, at least in t-hose countries in which they are likely to happen; although the science of building is not meant to prevent earthquakes. But for our purposes of illustration it should be noticed that cookery classes are meant neither to prevent earthquakes nor to preserve our property and lives from destruction by them; just as the Hague Court presumably is not meant either to prevent such wars as this nor to prevent destruction by war.] A. Galante. ' La Chiesa e le Chiese nella guerra attuale.' [The present war is not only a conflict of arms, but also a conflict of minds and of consciences. The religious consciences of belligerents have not been able to stand firm againat political and national currents ; the Churches of the various belligerent States all accept the war.

Endeavour to prove thoroughly that the two grounds on which belligerents have generally sought to defend or excuse their violations of International Law are military necessity and reprisals. 'A meaning has been Oiven to these two familiar terms by the belligerents which, if admitted, would involve the total collapse of International Law as removing the very foundations on which it is built.' The author thinks that 'it is not per- Ulissible to doubt that' International Law will survive the war, but that 'if it is to have any real authority and secure observance of its mandates it must obtain some sort of sanction. How is this to be obtained? It can of course be so only by general agreement among nations . . .' And so on. Quite good, especially the last part.] Book Reviews. Review of Reviews. Chronicle.

[Criticism of Pierre Duhem's thesis that the new ideas which Leonardo spread about so widely by his notes were not unknown to his successors: stolen by many authors, these ideas inspired the writings of the thieves on statics and dynamics during the whole of the sixteenth century and thus influenced the seventeenth. Favaro gives reasons for not believing either in a regular diffusion of Leonardo's manuscripts or in the existence of a 'Vincian Academy'; but does not wish absolutely to exclude the possibility that certain learned men of the sixteenth century might have seen some of Leonardo's manuscripts when they were dispersed long after their author's death, and might have published some of Leonardo's discoveries as their own. In this article the autbor gives a detailed examination of possible influence in the cases of Galileo and his School, and Benedetto Castelli in particular, and proves that they were not open to the charge of plagiarism. The author adds that the publication of the Opere of Galileo in the National Edition (edited by Favaro himself), that was accompanied by all Galileo's fragments, which often clearly show the evolution of Galileo's thought, furnishes an indirect proof of the originality of his work.

[The theory of quanta is an attempt to get out of the difficulty, with the least possible damage; into which we have been led by an apparently rigorous application of a collection of mechanical or physical principles universally admitted hitherto. Mathematically speaking, the only essential change introduced by Planck into the analysis of his precursors was to substitute, for an integral which becomes infinite, a discontinuous sum of elements grouped in such a way that it remains finite. When this substitution is made, nothing more is changed, and the principles of mechanics and physics are applied. '. . . Theories pass but facts remain. The facts that a theory has once connected are connected for ever, and this con- nexion serves to test the new and more perfect theory, which the progress of the sciences substitutes for the superannuated ones that have become too narrow.'] W. Bechterew. 'La localisation des psycho-reflexes dans l'ecorce cerebrale.,' [In the author's La psychologie objective (Paris, 1913), he concluded that the psychical or rather neuro-psychical activity of men and animals is nothing else than the aggregate 'of associated reflexes which are established in them by education and experience, and, according to circumstances, are found in the state of inhibition or re- viviscence. The impulses which give rise to the reproduction of these reflexes are associated in the cerebral cortex. The author then passes to the problem of the localisation of these associated reflexes in the brain. For the primitive division of the cortex into sensitive, motor, and psychi- cal centres, the author substitutes another: into sensori-motor regions possessing also psychical functions. Each of these regions serves for the establishment of associated reflexes in connexion with the others, and principally with the region of the musculo-cutaneous sense by which are established the more distant reflexes such as those of iocomotion and those which answer to the general needs of tho organism.] Sir A. Hopkinson. 'the Sanction in International Law.' ['The idea of framing a complete International Code, attempting in minute detail, by elaborate provisions, to regulate the rights of nations in peace and in war, has utterly broken down.... To be of any value International Law must be capable of development and adaptation to new conditions. . . The deeper question is whether serious disputes between nations are to be settled regularly by law, and by some tribunal, or by resort to arms, and whether any power will ever exist which will prevent a great military nation not only setting itself deliberately above all conventions, all rules of received International Law, but also flagrantly outraging every sentiment of humanity, denying by its acts the very idea of Justice. . . Without going to war the neutral nations by joint action might have used a sanction to enforce some regard for nieutral rights, imposed a penalty on their flagrant violation, which might prevent future outrages. While a single German soldier remains in Belgium with the acquiescence of neutral Powers it is useless to talk of the reian of Inter- national Law.'] A. Pillet. 'Le probleme de la guerre.'

Once again the German lesson will have taught this truth to Europe.

[First refers to articles by Rignano and Peano in Scientia for January, February, March, and September, 1915. 'The proper reply to Rignano seems to be that, until comparatively lately, symbolism in mathematics and the algebra of logic had the sole aim of helping reasoning by giving a fairly thorough analysis of reasoning and a condensed form to the analysed reasoning, which should, by suggesting to us analogies in familiar branches of algebra, make mechanical the process of following the thread of deduction; but that, on the other hand, a great part of what modern mathematical logic does is to increase our subtlety by emphasising differences in concepts and reasonings instead of analogies.' The ideas of Leibniz on the nature of symbolism, the early symbolic logicians, the work of Peano, Frege, Russel], and Whitehead is shortly described in the articles; but the part of most philosophical interest is in the first section. It is a confusion of thought that has led many to believe that mathematical logic seeks to displace the free spirit of discovery or inven- tion in mathematics. Mathematics uses a form of 'economy of thought ': 'In our efforts to extend the dominion of science we find it necessary to arrange so that those trains of reasoning which have been already per- formed and which require no special talent to repeat, but merely memory, should be reproducible without any mental effort, so that we may reserve all our mental energy to subjugate the many new and difficult problems we meet. It must be remembered that the intellectual intuition which perceives the truth of logical laws in their simple but absolutely universal form is unable, owing to our limitations in memory and visual- ising power, to perceive the same truths in more complicated forms.' This ' economy of thought' is a maxim for the process of discovery, and has no logical connexion with what is discovered. 'What we discover is truth: how we discover it is a matter of psychology. . . . The concep- tions of logicians or mathematicians are tools which are useful for approximate descriptions of the changeless world of truth, but they are formed by us. Concepts, on the other hand, are, in my use of the term, the entities of which conceptions are the-often blurred-images in our minds. Thus the words " definite integral of a function" denote a con- cept of which the conceptions of Leibniz, Bernoulli, Euler, Cauchy, Riemann, Darboux, Jordan, and Lebesgue were mental images that got nearer and nearer the reality. Concepts are the combinations which are the subjects of definitions in mathematical logic. Definitions are theo- retically superfluous, and the only trace left in them of the importance of the corresponding conceptions is that, when we have discovered-and we have logical criteria for telling us when we have done this-and expressed a concept, we can express more shortly' certain truths. Again; 'it is as important to distinguish between conception and concept as it is to distinguish between sensation and sense-datnm.' It seems to the reviewer that the illustration of the distinction between concepts and conceptions is not quite happy: Riemann's definite integral is a logical definition of a concept, Lebesgue's integral is not more logically precise</page><page sequence="10">382 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. but simply more general. A better illustration would be that of the different meanings which 'continuity' has had. There is a criticism of what might seem to be Russell and Whitehead's idea that 'importance' is a logical notion, and of Frege's and these writers' introduction of the psychological principle of ' assertion'. ' Since probably every inventory of the logical world that-we shall ever make will be infected by psycho- logy, the history of. science is not superfluous even to the logicians.'] H. von Zeipel. 'Etoiles et molecules.' [Invisible molecules and the suns of the heavens both obey the same laws of dynamics and probability. Stars are the molecules of the universe. Exposition of some of the most remarkable analogies between the phenomena in these two domains. A long and interesting article, with some striking stellar photographs.] B. Pirotta. ' L'origine di nuove specie secondo la teoria dell' incrocio.' [Exposition of I. P. Lotsy's (critic of H. de Vries) theory of crossing to explain the origin of new species; there is no critical examination of the theory.] Ch. Gide. ' La Quadruple Entente .6conomique.' [A very thorough examination of the programme of the quadruple economic Entente. It is interesting to notice that, quite by the way, it is mentioned that the article was written as far back as, July 29, 1915.[ J. E. G. de Montmorency. 'International Law after the War.' ['The influence of German materialism had shown itself in many directions in the decade preceding the war, but in no direction was this subtle and malign influence more dangerously manifested than in the region of law.' Examination of the German position with regard to law. Theory and principles of International Law, and application to the position after the war. 'When the peoples of the world realise the fundamental necessity of a Union which will not only preserve peace, but will facilitate trade, enlarge the confines of science, art, and religion, and stamp a new morality on the individual as well as on the nations, then the Entente will be followed by formal Union.'] Book Reviews. [The books on economics that are reviewed are R. Auspitz and R. Lieben's Recherches sur la thgorie du prix (Paris, 1914, French translation), F. Oppenheimer's L'economie pure et 1'economie politique (Paris, 1914, French translation), J. Singer's Der Laicd der Monopole: Amerika oder Deutschland? (Berlin, 1913), and R.

It will be seen that Scientia continues its interesting and important pro- gramme of scientific synthesis. Vol. xxi., March, 1917. G. Milhaud. 'Descartes et Bacon.' [In spite of the essential opposition between these two thinkers which we are now inclined at onlce to put into words, Descartes does not seem to have been conscious of any opposition. We have, then, to explain the fact that the polemic of Bacon against any method a priori did, not rouse Descartes. Indeed it seems either that Descartes had with Bacon more in common than we believe, or that he did not feel how far he was from him. There was, in fact, a great deal in common between the intentions of the two which might possibly have brought Descartes closer to Bacon; and, further, the rules for reaching the truth given by Descartes do not really differ as much as one is in- clined to believe at first from the rules of Bacon. And all this is quite apart from such common points as the exclusion from physics of final causes and a fundamental mechanistic theory. However, it is truie that Descartes gave the most important part in knowledge to the ' pure intui- tion ' which directly seizes the truth, while Bacon certainly condemned all 'anticipations of the mind' throughout his writings. If Bacon had lived longer, he would doubtless have put forth all his energies to combat the intuitive method of Descartes.] M. Cantone. 'Sull, odierno in- dirizs6 degli studi fisici.' [A very interesting and broad survey of the</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHICAL 'PERIODICALS. 383 present tendency of physics. 'These studies were suggested by a reason- able scepticism as to the conservation of the matter of which a body is made up, and still more as to the invariability of its volume. We cannot deny, in fact, that chemical processes or mechanical actions or even a very feeble evaporation may alter the constitution of a body; but further, it is to be feared still more that gradual variations in the volume of a solid take place owing to a secular thermo-elastic change.'] I2. Rabaud. 'La vie et la mort des especes. Premiere Partie: La theorie classique des moyens de defense.,' [The classical theory of 'means of defence' is anthropomorphic: life, it holds, is an incessant conflict of beings with each other and against their environments, and, since the various species to which the beings belong do not disappear, the individuals-must pos- sess efficacious means of defence. In another article the author will examine why it is that the enormous destructions of individuals do not have as a result a destruction of species.] E. R. A. Seligman. 'The Economic Prospects of the United States after the War.' [' The economic conditions of the United States after the war will differ in important respects from what existed previously; and these changed conditions, whicb will force the United States out of its shell of isolation, are pregnant of large political possibilities to not a few of the European nations.'] V. Carpi. 'La durata della guerra.' ['It is not the old principles that have been overtaken, but the fact is that the applications of these principles is being made in a larger and more complex medium, and thus more time is necessary. The war of the present time does not consist merely in the meeting in battle of soldiers and cannons, but it- is the highest and most genuine expression of all civil forces.'] Book Reviews. [The reviews of books on questions on economics are of E. Salvi's Storia del diritto di propriieta (Milano, 1915); A. Segre's Manuale di Storiia del commercio (Torino, 1915); E. Ciccotti's Vecchi e nuovi orizzonti della Numismatica e funzione dellta moneta nel mondo antico (Milano, 1915).] Review of Reviews.

PSYCHOLOGIE. Bd. lxxvi. Heft 1 u. 2. H. Henning. 'Der Geruch,, IV.' [Smell is determined by the way in which the osmo- phores are grouped about the osmogenic radical or nucleus; the six psychological classes correspond, in fact, with six typical configurations of the molecule, and transitional odours with mixed configurations. The author further discusses the minimum perceptibile, the measurement of olfactory sensation (methods and instruments), thle process of excitation by way of the olfactory mueosa, the smell of aquatic animals, the alleged degeneration of the sense in man, the aesthetics of smell, etc. A mono- graph is promised for the near future.] Literaturbericht.

The writer begins with topogenic sensory elements which, under the mechanism of recognition, become individual (not yet logical) signs. The continuity of space perception, and the relations of quantity and similarity exhibited by special perceptions, are referred to processes of apperceptive and associative fusion and of attentional and partitive dissociation, themselves touched off by the spatial distribution of stimuli.] U. Heymans. 'In Sachen des psychischen Monismus. Iv. Dualistischer und monistischer Psychismus.'

[An appreciation of Hughlings Jackson, who anticipated Poppelreuter's view of the isolated sensation, and the biological theory of perception represented by Wertheimer and Koffka. An illustration from pathology is afforded by the 'phantom' persisteilce of an amputated limb; Head's schemna is an application of Jackson's principles.] Literaturbericht.</page></plain_text>
