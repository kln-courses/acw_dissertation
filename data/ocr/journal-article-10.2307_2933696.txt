Mary Shelley once observed that her husband "deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics"; he decided in favor of poetry. Karen Weisman thinks that Shelley's choice was a mistake. She argues that although he re- mained dedicated all his life to the pursuit of metaphysical truth, Shel- ley was continually checked by the inadequacy of figurative discourse to satisfy his transcendent needs. In consequence, his poetry is marked by doubt, anxiety, and guilt even as it persists in a quest for a mode of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 235 fiction-making that can move beyond the unstable world of time to convey a metaphysical ultimate. Weisman's is an original and challenging book. In it she explores the Kantian problematic of the relation between Being and Knowing, which is, of course, a central concern of the British Romantic poets. Shelley is well known for reformulating this issue as a dialectic be- tween skepticism and desire, and Weisman shrewdly examines the interplay of both these moments in his poetry to call into question the extravagant claims of Romantic expressive theory for poetry as a way of knowing. Her originality lies in the critical vocabulary she creates to elucidate the Kantian tension in Shelley's poetry, a vocabulary in which "the ineffable" designates an ultimate metaphysical reality that is beyond words and "the quotidian" designates the phenomenal real- ity of everyday experience that supplies the metaphors through which Shelley seeks transcendence. This terminology allows Weisman to stake out a critical position on Shelley that she distinguishes from deconstruction insofar as it "claim[s] for him entirely different motiva- tions, metaphysical conceptions, and concluding anxieties" (p. i6o). She thus challenges the prevailing view of Shelley among American critics by stressing the persistence of his desire for the apprehension of truth; by dwelling on his continued failure to achieve this goal, she in turn challenges her reader to defend the value of poetic language. It is in charting Shelley's shifting allegiances to the quotidian and to the ineffable that Weisman makes her most important contribution. She very deftly shows how Shelley's creative development is driven forward by his search for an adequate fiction, but she always alerts us to the risks he runs in trying to find words to express his sense of the ultimate. As early as Queen Mab Shelley launches an attack on those who guess at divine truths by means of anthropomorphic fictions that harden into an oppressive orthodoxy, only to find that he cannot so easily dispose of an old set of fictions without resorting to new fictions to take their place. Even revealing his own fictions as consciously constructed-as he does in the Hymn to Intellectual Beauty and Mont Blanc-will not save him, for the very act of figuration itself entails a substitution of finite, this-worldly objects for infinite, other-worldly truths. Sadly, he can pursue the latter only at the expense of the former. Weisman cogently maintains that "Shelley throughout his ca- reer will struggle to reconcile the contrary claims of imagination (and imagination's manifestations in the necessary fictions of poetry) to the quotidian world from which poetry derives its metaphors and concrete images" (p. 38). This sort of appropriation of the natural to serve the supernatural is at the heart of the young poet's dilemma in Alastor,</page><page sequence="3">236 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE where violating the bounds of the temporal incurs immense personal cost. And such cost Shelley would continue to pay right through Epipsychidion to Adonais and The Triumph of Life. Weisman is quite con- vincing in her treatment of Shelley's last poem as a replay of the im- passe encountered in his earlier works. While it is hard to argue against her that Shelley was never finally able to move beyond this impasse, it is equally difficult to accept her view of Shelley as a monodic poet trapped by the inadequacy of language in every single poem he wrote. For Shelley is, if anything, a polyphonic poet, and it is only by attending to his many voices (besides the angst-ridden one) and to his many moods that he can be appreciated. This is not to deny that there is anxiety and melancholy in Shelley's poetry, but it is to decenter them. A hint at a different focus is given at the outset of Weisman's chapter on Prometheus Unbound when she describes this work as a text in which "Shelley achieves full understanding of the resistance of certain poetic thoughts to discursive language" (p. 8i). The notion that "poetic" thoughts could exist prior to verbal articulation is promising, for it suggests nonverbal dimensions to Shelley's poetic intelligence. But the idea that what is "poetic" can only be expressed in "discursive lan- guage" effectively cancels any value that can be attached to feeling, music, or kinesthetic movement in Shelley's verse and reduces the language of poetry to sequential argument and reasoning. It is no wonder, then, that Weisman places her emphasis on silence rather than sound in Prometheus Unbound, and she denies that there are any "heard voices" in the poem while insisting that "the reader is 'witness' only to the written language" (pp. 86-87). Her bleak impression that "we are merely readers who cannot partake of the action and who cannot hear the voices" (p. 1 1 1) might benefit from the simple expedient of reading the poem out loud. The discovery that the deep truth is imageless does not mean that Shelley's voices must always collapse into silence, as Weisman repeat- edly claims (pp. 95, 167). Nor does the fact that "his poetry actualizes desire for apprehension of truth" (p. 159-and fails in that aim) mean that this was the only desire Shelley articulated through figurative language. An equally strong desire was his wish for a better world, and it is symptomatic of Weisman's exclusive focus on metaphysics in this book that she totally marginalizes Shelley's political verse. There is no doubt in her mind of "the inefficacy of art which is aware of its own failures"; a conviction of the inadequacy of language, we are told, "clearly shows [Shelley's] conscious separation of visionary poetry from political efficacy, or even political savvy" (p. 98). Weisman never men- tions the Ode to the West Wind and barely alludes to The Mask of Anarchy;</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 237 yet these poems were indeed efficacious when they found readers among nineteenth-century workers and inmates of twentieth-century prison camps. It turns out that Weisman's attempt to dissociate her critique of Shelley from that of deconstruction is a distinction without a differ- ence. The frustrated and disappointed Shelley she gives us is barely distinguishable from de Man's. But this particular performance of Shel- ley's text may be endemic only to our particular moment in Western history. Shelley has been performed differently in the past, and he is being read today quite differently outside of America and Europe. Historicizing the reception of Shelley's text may yet be a mode of resistance to the privileging of our own postmodern gloom. RONALD TETREAULT Dalhousie University</page></plain_text>
