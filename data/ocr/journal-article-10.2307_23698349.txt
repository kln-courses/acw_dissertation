<plain_text><page sequence="1">Suicides, Jean Baechler, translated from the French by Barry Cooper, Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1979. Pp. 474. £17.50. Death Wishes? H. G. Morgan, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons, 1979. Pp. 172. £10.00. There has been no diminution in interest in the phenomena of suicide and attempted suicide in recent years. Indeed, books and articles proliferate—some times to the confusion of those who would wish to understand the problem better. It is with some ambivalence therefore that one accedes to a request to review two further additions to this growing literature. In the event, such a cautionary 'stance' was happily unjustified. Both volumes, in their different ways, not only add to our understanding, but are fortuitously complementary to one another in that they help to build bridges between the more narrowly defined clinical approach and that which might best be described as the anthropomorphic. Baechler, by training and inclination a social philosopher, has set out to review the subject of suicide in its broadest possible context. In order to execute his survey he reveals himself to be something of a polymath; the breadth of his analysis, for the most part, in no way suffers from the superficiality that might have shown itself in the work of a less able scholar. Central to his theme is the notion that 'suicide ... is a positive act that a human being undertakes to solve an existential problem . . .' (p. 225). Within this central theme, Baechler pursues what are best described as three major sub-themes. The first concerns the 'plurality and heterogenity of suicide', the second concerns itself with 'suicide populations' and the third is the notion that suicide must be seen against the background of man's life as a many faceted and continuing struggle. Having developed this overall schema (which, of necessity I have over-simplified con siderably), Baechler exemplifies it through the use of an ingenious eleven-fold</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 4O5 classification—grouped to form four broader categories: flight, grief, punishment (escapist suicides); crime, revenge, blackmail, appeal (aggressive suicides); sacri fice, transfiguration (ablative suicides); ordeal, game (ludic suicides). In order to propound and 'flesh out' his classificatory framework, Baechler draws his case examples from a vast illustrative literature including mythology, anthropology, novels and clinical and statistical surveys. He acknowledges his own lack of direct clinical experience, but in many respects this adds to rather than detracting from his more objective phenomenological viewpoint. Baechler's interest in suicidal behaviour developed in almost serendipitous fashion out of his more far-ranging concern about the problems facing contemporary civilisation. (He is the author of Revolution, 1976, and The Origins of Capitalism, 1976). Herein lies the possible cause of one of the book's few faults. Originally conceived and executed as a much longer work, its preparation for an English market has meant the loss of some twenty-five percent of its original length; this has resulted inevitably in some lack of balance in some places. In the main, however, the translator has (as far as my limited French allows), done a commendable job. Occasionally, the need to find English equivalents for French terms has resulted in one or two infelicities. For example, lithium carbonate becomes (I think erroneously), lithium gluconate and psychopathy is confused in translation with psychopathology. The section in the book dealing with 'The Psychiatric Context' is perhaps for this reason the least satisfactory in my view. It is at this point that readers would do well to turn to Professor Morgan's succinct clinical account of suicidal behaviour. Although written from an essentially clinical perspective, this book addresses itself more generally to the problems of suicide and non-fatal self-harm. Judicious use of case histories fills out on the more general data and these are complemented by a description of the author's own research work in Bristol. Although social workers and other non medically qualified personnel will find the guide-lines for the assessment of suicidal risk and for prevention (Chapters 7 and 13) of use, it is my view that the book's value would have been enhanced if these aspects had been elaborated upon. In some places in the book Professor Morgan may be assuming on the part of 'lay' readers a greater acquaintance with technical terms than they are likely to possess. (As for example at page 43 where trigeminal nerve root section is not defined and at page 141 where specific and technical physical treatments are described.) Alas, in common with many others. Professor Morgan fails to recognise that probation officers are social workers, treating them as separate beings. The simple expedient of inserting the words local authority in front of social worker could make the distinction clear. However, these are minor criticisms in a book which I found both intellectually satisfying and of immediate practical use. Taken together, these two books make significant contributions to the growing literature of suicidology. I doubt whether many social workers will be able to buy them in these difficult times, but I hope that they will be regarded as priority acquisitions by libraries.
