<plain_text><page sequence="1">Was Charles I a Tyrant? by R. W. K. Hinton I CHARLES I was charged in the indictment before the High Court of Justice, at the trial before his execution, with enter- taining "a wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlim- ited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will." To this end he had "traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present parliament." It is usual to scoff at this. How could a king commit treason? Indeed he could not. Yet if he had set out to make himself a tyrant this was a grave offense which, though unknown to English law courts, had often been accounted in po- litical theory as deserving death. The issue of treason is therefore without importance: however bad in law, there was certainly no lesser charge on which to bring a king to execution. The important question concerns tyranny. Tyranny was the only offense for which political theory in the early moder period justified resistance. No political theory held that misgovernment in the moder meaning of the word justified it; and kings were allowed to make errors of judgment much more readily than are the governments of today. Charles I made mis- takes that modern public opinion would never forgive in a president or prime minister. But not for this was he resisted. What kings were strictly forbidden was to subvert the frame of the constitution. Only in doing this they became tyrants. In England tyrannicide was never respectable and therefore the fatal word in the indict- ment had to be treason, but equally the content of the treason could only be tyranny. It is easy to make too much of the formal illegality of the trial, for it was far less illegal than it need have been. The king could have been poisoned or killed while trying to escape, he could have been tried in camera, false reports of the trial could have been pub- lished, and in the end he could have been executed-if not secretly, which would have allowed it to be said that he still lived-at least in a manner that concealed his dignity of bearing. In fact the court was set up by the highest public authority, the trial was pub- 69</page><page sequence="2">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS lic, and the execution was performed in due form. There is no need to argue that the trial was "fair," because he was obviously condemned before it began. Yet the business was carried out in as proper a manner as the circumstances permitted. The authori- ties behaved as if they had nothing to hide and as if they expected the charge to carry moral conviction if not legal. They permitted criticism to appear in print without purging the critics. In this they were wise. The bulk of the people did not like the execution but found that they could stomach it. It had been made to appear as an act of justice and they took it so. It was not murder but tyrannicide. Tyranny was no new accusation evolved in the heat of the civil war. It had been the burden of charges against the king's evil counsellors at the very beginning of the Long Parliament, before the appeal to arms, when the Commons were united in resistance. People did not therefore accept the king's fate simply out of weari- ness with war or because their judgments had become distorted by passion. II The most formal definition of tyranny in the English tongue during Charles I's reign was contained in Jean Bodin's Six Books of a Commonweal, published in an English translation by Richard Knolles in 1606. Bodin divided monarchies into three classes: 1. "Lawful or royal" monarchies, "where the subjects obey the laws of the monarch, and the monarch the laws of nature, the subjects enjoying their natural liberty and the propriety of their goods." 2. "Lordly" monarchies, "where the prince is become lord of the goods and persons of his subjects, by law of arms and lawful war; governing them as the master of a family doth his slaves." 3. "Tyrannical" monarchies, "where the prince contemning the laws of nature and nations, imperiously abuseth the persons of his free born subjects, and their goods as his own." The lawful or royal monarch and the lordly monarch were alike legitimate, according to the constitution of their realms. Only the tyrannical monarch was illegitimate. Lordly monarchy was created by force of arms, that is by conquest. If a lawful monarch tried to make himself lordly in his own realm he could only suc- 70</page><page sequence="3">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? ceed in creating tyranny. Bodin believed that the progress of civ- ilization tended to transform lordly monarchs into lawful ones and that the only lordly monarchs at present remaining were in eastern Europe and Asia. England was one of the lawful monarchies. By virtue of these definitions it was open to Bodin's English readers to put Charles I among the tyrants. He had abused the persons of his free born subjects by putting them in prison without trial and had taken their goods without their consent: they had lost their natural liberty and the propriety of their goods. The outstanding examples are impositions on merchandise, ship money, and the imprisonment of the five knights per speciale mandatum regis, but others less conspicuous had affected, it is not too much to say, every man in the country. We may think of the monopolies. The effect of monopolies was disputable but the nature of them was plain. They were cases where the king had taken a commodity or a service that was originally in the propriety of the subjects, had made it his own, and had delegated it to a deputy. When the king commanded that nobody was to make soap except those licensed by his special grant and that nobody was to sell soap unless marked with a mark to be applied only by those licensed by a second grant; and when these people had power to break into private houses and destroy the householder's goods; and finally when some old soap- makers who would not conform were heavily fined and imprisoned at the instance of the licensees in the Court of Star Chamber; this was clearly a case where the king had abused the persons of his free-born subjects and their goods as his own. To one who saw the situation in this light it was quite beside the point when Charles claimed that he had legal precedents for his actions, because in the nature of the case this was only to be expected. It was implied from the start in Bodin's definition of monarchy. The sign of a monarch was "to give laws to all his subjects in general, and to every one of them in particular . . . without consent of any other greater, equal, or lesser than himself," and this was as true in a lawful monarchy as in a lordly one. We are not distinguishing between strong monarchs and weak ones, for the weak ones have already been discarded by Bodin as not monarchs at all: we are distinguishing between strong monarchs who use their power in a lawful way and strong monarchs who use it in a lordly way. It would therefore be very surprising if the 71</page><page sequence="4">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS laws given in a lawful monarchy contained no precedents for lord- liness and it was natural that the process towards lordliness should take place principally in the courts of law. Of course the attempt could be assisted outside the courts and acts of force and fraud were to be looked for, among which Bodin's English readers could count the billeting of troops, the removal of judges, the lapse of parliaments; but the central process was a legal one of necessity. The fact that it was legal could not make it lawful. A follower of Bodin would not have been impressed by the fact that judges sanc- tioned impositions, ship money and imprisonment per speciale mandatum regis in courts of common law. This argument for the irrelevance of legal decisions does not depend only on Bodin's actual words but follows, after his distinc- tion between lawful and lordly monarchies, from the obvious facts -so obvious that he himself did not speak of them-that law per- vaded every aspect of political life and that nations were too big for it to be swept away at a stroke. The Machiavellian coup d'etat was not possible in the large Western states. For this reason the proposition carries a further implication, namely, that the process to lordliness, besides being legal, was necessarily gradual. This gradualness is important, because it meant that relatively minor things would achieve a greater significance than they may seem to have deserved: a penny tax or an unhappy phrase in a law dictionary were enough to rouse passions. In England we can actually see this happening; and on at least one occasion the House of Commons took trouble to explain to the king that their strong line in defense of liberty was not the result of present oppressions so much as of fears for the future. In the parliament of 1610 the Commons informed the King, as to Bate's case about impositions, that "a general consent is had that the reasons of that judgment may be extended much farther, even to the utter ruin of the an- cient liberty of this kingdom and of your subjects' right of propri- ety in their lands and goods." Their petition of grievances ended with a protest against a tax on Sunderland coal shipped to London, "which imposition is not only grievous for the present . . . but dangerous also for the future, considering that the reason of this precedent may be extended to all the commodities of this kingdom." For "among many resemblances which are observed to be between the natural and politic bodies, there is none more apt and natural 72</page><page sequence="5">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? than this, that the diseases of both do not at one instance com- monly seize upon all parts: but beginning in some one part, do by tract of time, and by degrees, get possession of the whole, unless by applying of wholesome and proper remedies in due time they may be prevented; which, as it is in many things very visible, so it is in nothing more apparent than in this matter of impositions."l III It is idle to estimate the "influence" of Bodin in England. (The English translation went to only one edition.) Obviously the Eng- lish were not simply his disciples and had political ideas of their own. These are best looked for outside the field of constitutional controversy in places where they may be taken to have met with general acceptance. In the seventeenth century a lively curiosity about foreign countries was fed by a stream of travels, histories and general accounts, and it is here rather than in the controversies about English affairs that we observe most clearly the Englishman's broad views and basic assumptions. Let us examine the literature on the empire of the Turks. The books show such a striking con- sensus of opinion that they cannot fail to represent very deep- seated ideas. According to Bodin the Turkish and Muscovite empires were lordly, indeed the only lordly monarchies in Europe. In the Eng- lish literature, on the other hand, the Great Turk was always called a tyrant and his empire a tyranny. But this was not because the English recognized different characteristics in it from Bodin. The outstanding feature of the English literature is the character of the Great Turk as "lord of the goods and persons of his subjects," gov- erning them "as the master of a family doth his slaves," and yet at the same time according to the law and custom of the land. The Englishman's tyrant was therefore the same person as Bodin's lordly monarch, and in order to judge how nearly Charles I came to being a tyrant we should understand what was commonly said about the Great Turk. Richard Knolles-Bodin's translator, and author of the best history of the Turks-said: "The Ottoman government mere tyran- 1The Parliament of 1610 is discussed, and these opinions are cited more fully, in my article, "Government and Liberty under James I," The Cambridge Historical Journal, XI (1953), 48 ff. 73</page><page sequence="6">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS nical." "The Ottoman government in this his so great empire is altogether like the government of the master over his slave, indeed mere tyrannical: for the great Sultan is so absolute a lord of all things within the compass of his empire, that all his subjects and people, be they never so great, do call themselves his slaves, and not his subjects: neither hath any man power over himself, much less is he lord of the house wherein he dwelleth, or of the land which he tilleth.... Neither is any man in that empire so great ... as that he can assure himself of his life, much less of his present for- tune or state, longer than it pleaseth the Sultan. In which so abso- lute a sovereignty (by any free born people not to be endured) the great tyrant preserveth himself by two most especial means...." "In brief, an easy thing it is for the great tyrant to find occasion for him at his pleasure to take away any man's life, together with his wealth be it never so great: so that he cannot well be said to lack money so long as any of his subjects hath it."2 The Grand Turk's bloody tyranny was the most conspicuous feature of the Ottoman empire, and was continually dinned into English minds by travel-books and histories. George Sandy's Rela- tion of a Journey begun 1610 shows a picture on the title-page of "Achmet sive Tyrannus"; his hands grasp an orb and a yoke, he tramples on a book, and the scales of justice lie damaged at his feet. Fynes Moryson-an academic man, a fellow of a famous Cambridge college, with some knowledge of the civil law, who had travelled in Turkey and professed to write from first-hand experi- ence-declares that "the form of the Ottoman empire is merely absolute, and in the highest degree tyrannical using all his subjects as born slaves." "The greatest of all hold life and goods at the emperor's pleasure, upon an hour's warning, among whom happy are the lean, for the fat are still drawn to the shambles." Fynes Moryson was interested in the Turks' laws of inheritance. He found them simple. "For unmovable goods: the emperor's soldiers have none, nor yet his great officers, being all captives or tributary chil- dren. And howsoever the emperor subduing any province divided it into timars or farms, giving them . . . upon conditions to the chief men of his army, yet they hold them only for life, or at his 2 Richard Knolles, A Brief Discourse of the Greatness of the Turkish Em- pire, appended to his General History of the Turks (London, 1603). I have used the fourth edition, 1631. 74</page><page sequence="7">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? pleasure. ... For movable goods: the great men of the army gather huge treasure by extortion but the emperor commonly strangles them, and takes all their goods."3 Peter Heylyn in Microcosmus mentions the smallness of the Grand Turk's ordinary revenue-a common point-and explains it in the usual fashion, namely by the largeness of his extraordinary revenue. "The money received [in ordinary revenue] is ... but fifteen millions of sultanies, which is nothing in respect of so great an empire: the chief reason whereof is the tyrannical government of the Turk, which dehorteth men from tillage, merchandise, and other improvements of their estates, as knowing all their gettings to lie in the Grand Signeur's mercy. His extraordinary revenue is uncredible: for . . no man is master of his own wealth farther than stands with the Emperor's liking. So that his great bassas are but as sponges to suck up riches, till their coffers swell, and then to be squeezed into his treasury."4 The Turkish tyranny ran from top to bottom. "Now next to their wives," says George Sandys, "we may speak of their slaves: for little difference is made between them." With tyranny went physical cruelty and what the civilized Eng- lish regarded as sheer barbarity. There is no hint of the possibility of enlightened or benevolent despotism. The English even appear to have disapproved of the rarity of theft and assault among the Turks, as if these things were signs of liberty; they describe the bastinado, impalement and other terrible deaths, and imply that overharsh punishments are worse than crime. They also disapprove of the swiftness of procedure in Turkish courts of law, refusing to recognize that the outcome is justice. Thus Fynes Moryson: "The strict observance of laws among the Turks is worthily called tyran- ny ... since that which is just must be done justly. Whereof there is no practice in this empire."5 One soon wearies of the unconcealed plagiarism of these ac- cusations, and the more so when they turn up again in accounts of Russia, of which we may content ourselves with Peter Heylyn's 3 From the proposed continuation of Fynes Moryson's Itinerary (London, 1617), which has been published in part by Charles Hughes as Shakespeare's Europe (London, 1903), pp. 11-12, 39, 66. 4Heylyn, Microcosmus (Oxford, 1625), p. 605.

When one had said this one had said all.6 Such was tyranny. There is no need to state that these practices were regarded as contrary in every point to the practice of Eng- land, for the writers were obviously describing what was outlandish and strange, not what was familiar, in the belief that accounts of unfamiliar things broadened the reader's mind. One writer put it bluntly as follows. "Hereby wives may learn to love their husbands, when they shall read in what slavery women live in other countries . . and what liberty and freedom they themselves enjoy. Hereby servants may be taught to be faithful and dutiful to their masters, when they shall read of the brutish and barbarous inhumanity in other countries of masters towards their servants." As for the po- litical moral-"Hereby subjects may learn to love, honor, and obey their good and gracious king, when they shall read of the tyrannous government of other countries, and of the merciful government of theirs."7 One sees what a disastrous overturning of the commonwealth was thought to be involved by any motion in England towards a Turkish tyranny. However lawful in Turkey, nothing could be less so in England. This is the English, not the Turkish court; Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds, But Harry Harry. Had Charles I really made himself an Amurath by 1640? Clearly not-or it would have been too late to resist. He was accused only of the design. Whether the English positively compared their king to the Grand Turk is not easily determined, because it was too dangerous a comparison to be made in public. But foreign examples of a less damaging nature were used not infrequently. A converse argument on the king's side was that to abridge his pow- 6 Microcosmus, 1625, pp. 340-341. 7Theophilus Lavender, The Travels of Certain Englishmen (London, 1609), preface. 76</page><page sequence="9">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? ers would make him no more than a Duke of Venice. A play pub- lished in 1642 compared Charles I with the Shah of Persia, who was another lordly monarch or tyrant. "The most interesting fea- ture of the play," says Mr. Chew, "is the presence of pointedly topical allusions to contemporary English affairs. ... In his charac- terization of the Caliph ... the dramatist obviously has Archbishop Laud in mind. Even more specific is a brief episode which, found in the quarto of 1642, is significantly omitted from the edition of 1668 when it would have offended Charles II." The Shah was ordering supplies for his forces. A minister reported that the treas- ury was empty. The Shah replied: "Talk to me not of treasures or exchequers. Send for five hundred of the wealthiest burghers; their shops and ships are my exchequers." A courtier observed: "'Twere better you could say their hearts."8 IV As to their own constitution, the English recognized that the king was absolute but maintained that he ruled for the good of the commonwealth. We must fasten on this idea of commonwealth. The word denoted a body of people united by a common interest, in this case the whole body of the realm united for their own pres- ervation and welfare. The word was in increasingly common use in the sixteenth century and was probably contemporary with the New Monarchy, as Edmund Dudley's Tree of Commonwealth shows. If it should be thought that the ideas of commonwealth and of absolute monarchy made awkward fellows, a glance at the world of nature shows that they were not. The best seventeenth-century book on bee-keeping was Charles Butler's Feminine Monarchy. The life of bees is governed by the laws of nature. The community is a commonwealth. The bees work in their various ways for its welfare and preservation. They obey, feed, follow, protect and cherish a monarch. (At that time the queen was thought to play a more active part in the hive than she does.) Her commands are no less in accord with the law of nature than is the obedience of her subjects. The commonwealth perishes in her absence and she commands for its good. Bees love order, must be ruled, cannot 8S. C. Chew, The Crescent and the Rose (New York, 1937), p. 511. 77</page><page sequence="10">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS abide more than a single authority. Charles Butler calls the queen absolute. "The bees abhor as well polyarchy as anarchy, God having shewed in them unto men an express pattern of A PERFECT MONARCHY, THE MOST NATURAL AND ABSOLUTE FORM OF GOVERN- MENT."6 We are left in no doubt that Butler supposed this to be the form of government in England. The queen could not be called a tyrant, since she commanded for the general good, not her own; her commands, being natural, could not be arbitrary; she did not make her subjects' goods her own or them her slaves. Sir Thomas Elyot had noticed the same parallel at the very height of the Tudor absolutism. "In a little beast," he says, "which of all other is most to be marvelled at, I mean the bee, is left to man by nature, as it seemeth, a perpetual figure of a just governance or rule: who hath among them one principal bee for their governor, who excelleth all other in greatness.... I suppose who seriously beholdeth this example, and hath any commendable wit, shall thereof gather much matter to the forming of a public weal." Public weals were to him, like commonweals to others, states in which kings "nothing do acquire ... for their own neces- sities, but do employ all the powers of their wits and their diligence to the only preservation of other their inferiors."l0 In those days "unnatural" was a term of violent abuse and everything that was founded in nature was bound to be right. In human life marriage was natural and it was often said figuratively that the prince married the commonwealth. This did not debar the prince from being absolute, even when he was a woman and was therefore represented as the wife. There is a striking example in William Birch's Song Between the Queen's Majesty and Eng- land, where the accession of Queen Elizabeth is celebrated as a pastoral courtship. England sings boldly that "I am thy lover fair, hath chose thee to mine heir.... Therefore come away, make no delay! Sweet Bessy, give me thy hand." The Queen replies: "Here is my hand, my dear lover England, I am thine with both 9 Charles Butler, The Feminine Monarchy: or the History of Bees (various editions, 1609 to 1634), chap. 1. 10 Sir Thomas Elyot, The Governor, ed. Croft (1880), pp. 6-7, 12-13. Elyot disapproved of the term commonweal because to him it implied common ownership, but it was often used without this meaning. He did not notice that bees have common ownership. Charles Butler knew this, but did not let it affect his analogy. 78</page><page sequence="11">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? mind and heart, for ever to endure, thou mayest be sure, until death us two do part." But later comes an assertion of the Queen's absolute majesty. I trust all faithful hearts Will play true subjects' parts, Knowing me their true Queen and heir by right, And that much the rather For love of my father, That worthy prince King Henry th'eight.11 Doubtless the image came easier to a king than to a queen, and James I said "I am the husband and the whole isle is my lawful wife." He had recently written that as King of Scotland he was "master over every person that inhabiteth the same, having power over the life and death of every one of them."12 This last his Eng- lish subjects never accepted, but that he regarded himself as their husband would not have seemed provocative. Marriage was a vol- untary union and wives had power. Marriage appropriately represented the relation of king and commonwealth in at least two aspects. As in marriage the true interest of each party is to care for the other, so in a kingdom it is the true interest of the king and the commonwealth. On the king's side his best strength and only true greatness lay in the love and prosperity of his subjects, and on the subjects' side their true interest lay in an absolute monarchy, because strong single rulers best maintained harmony within the commonwealth and its power abroad. The New Monarchies were founded on this premise; and it is no idle rhetoric when princes asked to be loved and trusted and when subjects proclaimed undying loyalty in the very act of sticking up for their rights; while one of the most dangerous ac- cusations against monopolists and evil counsellors was that they deflected the subjects' love. Love once lost is hard to recover. In the early modern period kings relied on love in default of force of arms. It was therefore rightly held that the relation between a 11 Quoted from M. C. Bradbrook, The Queen's Garland (Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1953), pp. 59-60. 12 Speech at the opening of parliament, 1604. The True Law of Free Monarchies, published 1598. 79</page><page sequence="12">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS king and his subjects ought to be intimate and unimpeded, and that anyone who made bad blood between them was a traitor. It was also understood that people sometimes failed to appreciate where their true interest lay, and discord was thought to proceed ultimately from misinformation and errors of judgment. The early modem thinker, recognizing that men and princes were proud and women and multitudes fickle, was highly sensitive to signs of dis- cord. But as in marriage there was no divorce, so in a kingdom the reciprocal obligations of ruler and ruled were indissoluble "until death us two do part." No external arbiter could decide disputes or cut the knot, and internal quarrels had to be settled domestically. And here a further comparison seems relevant. As in English com- mon law the wife's personality was so merged into the husband's that she could not proceed against him, so in the kingdom all the law was the king's and he could therefore do no wrong. In both cases one of the parties enjoyed a legal predominance which was somewhat at variance with broader but no less valid principles of morality and nature. In the end then, love failing, the only rule was conscience. The mutual interest of ruler and ruled is the subject of other familiar analogies. When the prince is described as the keystone of an arch, it means that he will fall to the ground without his sub- jects' support just as they cannot stand without the special function performed by him. All play their parts and the only difference is that the prince's part is peculiar to himself. The same inference follows when the commonwealth is imagined as a human body of which the head represents the prince. I think we can see why the early modem period was so fond of political analogies. Only partly were they useful tools to gain the understanding of common people living close to the soil. In addition, they enabled writers to express the inmost indisputable thoughts on which everyone was fundamentally agreed, without raising actual questions of obedience and loyalty which were bound to lead to controversy. The frequency of their use, therefore, may be taken as a sign of the inherent dilemma in English political thought: not of its absence. It is sometimes said that the early modem period had no proper political theory because it only had theories of society, not of the state. But I think we must allow that there was a theory of the 80</page><page sequence="13">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? commonwealth and that it was founded on the ideas just described. It was cast (with an apparent but deceptive informality) in a tele- ological and anthropomorphic mould, but it tackled the eternal issues of political life. It may be said that it did not tackle them successfully. Today's political theory makes all roads lead to one center and all forces tend to one result, whereas early moder thinkers were content to imagine what looks dangerously like a tug-of-war-on one side the king, on the other side the subjects, two distinct but inseparable personalities like Siamese twins who might or might not wish to do the same thing at the same moment. Starting from the basic position that the true interests of king and people were identical, the early moder writers in Europe found it more appropriate to advocate good counsel, self-restraint, mercy and other virtuous qualities than to invent institutions incorporat- ing checks and balances, went to more trouble in explaining what a king ought not to do than in devising machinery for preventing him, and took a moral line where a moder writer would prefer something closer to practical politics. A theory which produces tyrannicide as the only ultimate answer to a wicked king can be called, with some justification, bankrupt; and it is understandable that in our present European tradition the early modem period should be a forgotten age, compared with the feudal period whose ideas are easily appreciated and with the later modern period whose ideas are like our own. In favor of early modern political theory it must be said that it truly represented the facts of political life at a time when nations were demanding government on a wider scale than before, and when kings did govern best and had to be allowed great power which it was obviously very difficult to ensure their not abusing. Where it embraced apparent incompatibilities without reconciling them this is at least better than if it had reconciled them; and where it refused to gloss over the everlasting tension between liberty and authority this seems no defect. In this light its ideas seem better described as naked than as bankrupt. But whether or not they composed a real theory, and whether the theory was sound or valueless, the ideas were as widely held as they were realistic and they recognized a dilemma that actually existed. No clearer illustration can be found than in the writing of Sir John Eliot. He energetically upheld the cause of liberty in the 81</page><page sequence="14">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS House of Commons and was thrice imprisoned by the king, in 1626 after referring to the Marquess of Buckingham as Sejanus, in 1627 after refusing to contribute to a forced loan, and in 1629 after the violent episode in the House of Commons when, the speaker being held in his chair by force, the House voted Eliot's three famous resolutions against innovation in religion and taxation without con- sent. He died in the Tower in 1632. His friends wished to carry the body home but Charles vindictively refused, and he was buried without honor in the parish where he died. During his stay in the Tower he wrote on political and moral philosophy. He does not appear to have written so as to curry favor, but in an attempt to resolve theoretically the political difficulties that had brought him where he was. When, therefore, a man with such a history magni- fies the power of the prince and says little or nothing about the power of parliament, this is a fact of great significance. In many passages he followed and quoted Bodin, but his work has not an air of slavish imitation. For our present purpose four of its char- acteristics stand out above the rest.13 First, note Eliot's extended and sophisticated use of analogy. Kings are like shepherds, commonwealths like sheep, kings are like physicians, commonwealths like patients, kings are like tutors, com- monwealths like pupils, kings are like pilots, commonwealths like ships. These similes occupy a central place in the argument and are developed with a wealth of detail, as if Eliot found the political relationship too difficult to describe more directly. They convey that the king's duty is the care of the commonwealth. Which party is superior to the other? The similes show that the question ought to be irrelevant, as indeed Eliot is at pains to point out. It is clear that he expects his readers to be familiar with them. Further, Eliot's monarch is very absolute. He is responsible for all government and cannot share the responsibility: sovereignty is indivisible. The scope of government at the same time is cast very wide, even to include "the operation of all good, which indus- try or wisdom shall invent, for the benefit and commodity of the kingdom ... all things exotic or innate, objects to art or industry, 13 De lure Majestatis and The Monarchy of Man were edited by Grosart in 1879 and 1882. I have discussed Eliot more fully in Cambridge Historical Journal, XI (1953). He has been unjustly neglected by writers on political thought, probably because he shares to the full the supposed defects of Bodin. 82</page><page sequence="15">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? for the strengthening or enriching of the state, which want that motion to themselves." This makes the monarch almost modem in his functions. He is no sleeping partner or passive umpire but (as the analogies implied) a positive leader and guide. Eliot there- fore makes him a legislator. As to positive laws he "hath supreme power, and is umpire and lord of his own actions, to alter them upon good occasion of state," and even as to divine and natural laws "a prince may declare them, and with due weighing of the circumstances apply them to the diversity of facts with equity, for varietas circumstantiarum variat ... ius." This is pure Bodin and in a good parliament man remarkable. Eliot refuses to assign sov- ereignty with all these legislative powers to the parliament. How- ever, it is typical. Only in the course of the civil wars, when par- liament had in fact shown that it could legislate on its own, was it first suggested that sovereignty could reside in an institution com- posed of more than one man. For the moment the House of Com- mons was thought to be a place where grievances were represented to the king and where the nation made grants to him, rather than a seat of legislation. Again, Eliot recognizes the peril of factious opposition. He goes so far as to recognize that some opposition is inevitable. Where shall we find a prince, he asks, "which offend not in something, doth not something which may be wrested to be against duty and fidelity? Let there arise some ambitious minion ... or some enemy of the public peace: or the people itself naturally mutable, unfaith- ful and a foe to sovereignty: let these clamor that the king hath committed felony, violated his oath, hath offered injury to one, hath neglected to defend another, etc. And in so large a field of accusations, there will never want cause to depose their king." We ask then whether, according to Eliot, it is ever lawful to depose a king. This question he does not answer, for he is not trying to justify rebellion. But he is quite clear that a king can do wrong. This is the fourth characteristic. He states repeatedly that a king does wrong when he acts other than for the good of the commonwealth. The criterion by which a king's actions are to be judged lawful or unlawful is nothing but the public good. It is practically impossible for him to exceed his powers, they are so absolute, and the restraint lies not in the extent of his authority 83</page><page sequence="16">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS but in the use he makes of it. This was implied in the analogies. Shepherds, pilots, tutors, physicians have their authority by virtue of their office, which is the care of their charges: and so have kings whose office is the care of the commonwealth. Thus the king may alter laws "upon good occasion of state." "In abrogating laws he must proceed with good conscience, for the evident utility of the commonwealth." "If the law tend to the good of the state, he must be so far from altering it, that if it were not made, he is bound to make it." These ideas seem to embody fundamental propositions on which all men-the king included-were agreed. It may be asked what the common good was, how the evident utility of the common- wealth was to be identified. Eliot does not say. At this point the theory is vague and opinions began to divide. Fortunately the question need not be asked. It is sufficient for us to know what was the common bad. The answer is simple. Anything approach- ing a Turkish tyranny or Bodin's lordly monarchy was bad. This was not simply because it meant altering the existing constitution (which the king and everybody would have condemned out of hand) but because it involved on the practical side a degradation and loss of material prosperity among the people. We have seen that the English were unable to conceive of any benevolence in tyranny. They were sure that lordliness in a monarch discouraged wealth because no man would bother to be industrious when he could call nothing his own. There was no tillage, no merchandise, no improvement of estates, among the Turks. Tyranny therefore was against the commonwealth not hypothetically or probably or because people were intellectually conservative, but in the most direct and literal fashion imaginable. The commonwealth largely existed for the common wealth. It did not exist for the king's wealth or a few individuals'. This belief gave meaning and potency to the common old distinction emphasized by Bodin, repeated by Eliot and made familiar by Professor Mcllwain, that to kings be- longed government, to subjects property. Charles I had strangled no bashaws but he had imprisoned his subjects without trial, and this for no other cause than that they would not give him money, that they would not be sponges. In all the monopolies likewise he had made the subjects' goods his own. 84</page><page sequence="17">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? The king himself could hardly have denied that these actions had a tendency to lordliness, though he would have protested that he did not mean to carry the tendency to extremes and that he in- tended only the good of the commonwealth. He claimed, how- ever, that his actions were lawful because the law of the land per- mitted them. This claim does not hold water. V When Richard Knolles published his translation of Bodin's Six Books of a Commonweal he told his English readers that "if beside the divers forms of commonweals, and such other worthy matter as is here by the author set down, you wish also to see by what laws and customs they have been governed ... I ... refer you unto the reading of the common law of this realm, which without all doubt in the ancient purity thereof, for religious sincerity, wisdom, power and equal upright justice, excelleth all the laws of men that ever yet were made." And yet common law courts allowed the king to do things that were tyrannous. It used to be said that the judges were corrupt. We are told that this is a whiggish view and that their judgments were good law. Professor McIlwain shows where they found that law-in the deep well of the gubernaculum whence the strong English king- ship could draw power after power. The defendants were far from denying that the powers existed but were able to believe that they were being misapplied, and therefore (for all their respect for the common law) the judgments in the king's favor did not convince them that his actions were lawful. Nor should they convince his- torians. The king held the initiative and had the choice of ground: when his lawyers produced a case the defendants had to answer within the king's terms of reference and the judges were bound to find according to the case stated: in short the king's case can never appear to better advantage than in the courts. When historians go to the courts (and the legal proceedings are much more acces- sible than the proceedings of parliament) they place themselves, like the judges and the defendants, in the king's power from the start. I am trying to suggest that the courts are not the only or the best place on which to base a judgment of the constitutional issue of the seventeenth century. The legal argument against the king was largely founded on 85</page><page sequence="18">THE REVIEW OF POLITICS the law behind the law. Common law judges knew not this law, and it is for this reason that they could hardly have decided other than they did-they were not a supreme court for the interpreta- tion of the constitution. Yet there was such a law. Not that "fun- damental law" had legal validity or indeed a pedigree. The fact is rather that by general consent the common law, though perfect, was not wholly adequate. It was essentially blind. It was just but not the whole of justice. There was also equity. There was the indispensable royal prerogative of mercy, the power to dispense with the rigor of the law when it was too harsh. The king's mercy was a necessary corollary of his justice, mercy was one of the stand- ard royal virtues, kings were as much bound to show clemency and mercy on some occasions as they were to be severe and terrible on others. How much more, then, were they to be careful of their grounds in bringing cases. In reality nothing is more whiggish and anachronistic than to assume that legal powers and precedents necessarily made a good case. We take this to be so today (though some exceptions are being noticed lately in England) because legislation is a continuous process and bad law is our own fault. It was not so in former days. The most prized of all moral qualities in the early moder period was moderation: moderation meant the not pushing of other qualities, though good ones, to extremes: in law it meant the not drawing precedents, though good ones, to their full extent. The idea that everything should be taken to its logical extreme is not found in the early modem period, either in its every-day con- versation or its political theory. Of course the king had precedents and of course the tyrannous acts were legal: it was only to be expected. Political thought recog- nized, as we saw, that this was in the nature of the case. Legality notwithstanding, they were wrong. He was none the less a tyrant because the law showed the way. The theorists with their reiter- ated and much-criticized moral restraints only gave formal ex- pression to a general opinion. Bodin typically pointed out that true greatness in a great man was to behave justly even when it was not illegal to behave unjustly.14 Eliot affirmed openly that many things were unjust though according to law, and insisted that the 14 Six Books of a Commonweal, book 1, chap. 8. 86</page><page sequence="19">WAS CHARLES I A TYRANT? 87 difference between a lawful king and a tyrant is that a true king "will not do what he may."16 When therefore Charles I did only what the law allowed, this does not mean that he acted correctly, and when his actions approached lordliness this justified the im- putation of a design to be a tyrant. 15 De Jure Majestatis, pp. 90-91.</page></plain_text>
