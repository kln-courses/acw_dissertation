Parallels for these two small figurines, measuring 5-6 cm, come from late 18th Dynasty Amarna.79 A similar monkey depiction from Egypt, dated to the late 18th dynasty, is considered a luxury item: made of green stone, it was used as Ornament on an oint ment bowl (Fig. 20).80 Another parallel from Egypt has cultic connotations: it is a bronze statuette (the size of an amulet) with gold inlays, also dated to the 18th Dynasty, depicting a monkey with his arms raised in what may be a prayer to the sun (Fig. 21).81 The role of monkey représentations in Myce naean culture is uncertain, but the scarcity of this imagery suggests that it was brought to Mycenae F'g- 20 EgyPf Schlögl 1978, 165 in the form of luxury goods, rather than as objects bearing religious significance.
