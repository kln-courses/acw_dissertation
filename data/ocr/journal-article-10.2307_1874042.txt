<plain_text><page sequence="1">970 Reviews of Books Hraban's work as well as the limitations of his range. According to Wolfgang Haubrichs, Otfried of Weissenburg, author of an influential gospel har- mony, took his cue from Hraban in biblical exegesis but not in choosing to translate the gospels into the vernacular. Gaugolf Schrimpf demonstrates con- vincingly (though others have made the point be- fore) that Hraban, who merits a footnote in the history of Christian doctrine because of his role in the controversy over predestination, misinterpreted Gottschalk's rather enlightened and socially useful position. Raymund Kottje examines Hraban's inter- est in problems and sources of the law and finds it inspired by pastoral concerns; though not a mere compiler, Hraban was not a great canonist. Howev- er, his own legislative activity as archbishop of Mainz, during the last eight years of his life, dis- cussed here by Wilfried Hartmann, reveals common sense as well as a determined will to reform his church. These essays reflect their origin as papers pre- sented by working specialists to others of the same kind. They vary in degree of significance for an understanding of the Carolingian scholar but collec- tively provide us with a clear notion of where scholarship on Hraban stands now and what prob- lems of his work and influence remain to be ex- plored. BERNHARD W. SCHOLZ Seton Hall University PAULINE MOFFITT WATTS. Nicolaus Cusanus: A Fif- teenth-Century Vision of Man. (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, number 30.) Leiden: E. J. Brill. 1982. Pp. 248, f 78. Until relatively recently Nicholaus Cusanus has been the Melchizedek of the history of Christian thought-without parentage and with only a few contested paternities. Giordano Bruno seems to have inherited the same blood type, but fatherhood of Kant's noumenal and phenomenal world seems a long shot, with many more likely sires. With Pauline Moffitt Watts's Nicholaus Cusanus: A Fifteenth-Century Vision of Man we have an attempt to see Cusanus resolutely in the context of the spiritual and intellectual problems of late medieval and Ren- aissance culture. More specifically, Watts attempts to trace his conception of human nature and its capaci- ties to his assimilation and transformation of the four great traditions of his age: scholasticism, hu- manism, Platonism, and mysticism. It is a task that cried out to be done, and it is done here with exemplary success. As examples of con- nections between Cusanus and these traditions the following, in particular, should be noted. Cusanus's principle that "there is no proportion between the finite and the infinite" paralleled the nominalist dialectics of the potentia Dei absoluta and the potentia Dei ordinata. But Cusanus went beyond the scholas- tics in setting up more radical grounds for the absolute freedom and transcendence of God. The study sparkles in its delineation of this Ger- man Hercules's connections with Italian humanists: Toscanelli, Cesarini, Bracciolini, Traversari, Lorenzo Valla, and others. Cusanus's significant humanist associations paid rich dividends in bring- ing to his learning and library the new fifteenth- century translations of Plato and the Platonic tradi- tion. He appropriated the Platonic dialectic of unity and plurality while rejecting the existence of inter- mediaries or agents between God and the creation. Here Watts gives due attention to Cusanus's twelfth- century Platonic sources, in particular Thierry of Chartres. The transmutation of mysticism is exam- ined in conjunction with Cusanus's application of images of light and sight in two later writings, the De visione Dei and the De Beryllo. The study represents a careful analysis of each of Nicholaus Cusanus's major works, beginning with the De docta ignorantia (1440) and ending with the De apice theoriae, written a few months before his death in 1464. Cusanus's vision of man, the universe, and God has most commonly been seen in terms of a funda- mental breakthrough or reorientation, attested by the author himself, achieved in the De docta ignoran- tia. Through her Gesamtwerk approach, tracing the major themes and developments in five main chap- ter-studies, Watts is able to show not only the formidable disjunction of man from creator and natural world but also the transcending principle Cusanus evolved from the four great traditions he transmuted: he found the ultimate creative force in the human mind itself, created in the image and likeness of the divine mind. So Watts traces an affirmative anthropomorphic principle, anchored in an exploration of Genesis 1: 26, which counteracted the impersonal disjunctive metaphysic that dominat- ed Cusanus's earlier thinking. Man in his unique cosmic freedom created a world of conjectures, a world of objects, and a world of play that proved his creation in God's image and likeness. Here the author is even able to trace a convincing link to Pico's affirmation of freedom and dignity. No dulce loquentem this, but a happy conjunction with Charles Trinkaus's In Our Image and Likeness, with the humanity and divinity in Italian humanist thought. ERNEST B.

Pp. xxi, 209. $29.50.</page><page sequence="2">Modern Europe 971 Peter Partner's best-known books hitherto have dealt with Rome and the papacy in central Italy. Now he has aimed his pen at the downfall of the military order of the Knights Templar, in which the papacy played merely a supporting role, and at the postmedieval mythology that grew up around the Templars, a development in which the papacy found no role at all. The first part of The Murdered Magicians deals with the history of the suppression of the Templar Order and analyzes the complex historiography that has grown up around it. The discussion is intelligent and well informed, but not startlingly novel. Partner has no new thesis to expound, no innovative expla- nation to propose for the Templars' much-contro- verted downfall. By and large he subscribes to Heinrich Finke's conclusions on the matter, which is to say that he accepts the more-or-less conventional view that has dominated Templar historiography since the beginning of this century. Partner is prop- erly skeptical of the more extreme efforts to excul- pate the Templars totally from the charges against them; he likewise rejects the simplistic interpretation that Philip the Fair set out to get the Templars solely because he wanted to grab their assets. Although Partner's treatment of the suppression of the Tem- plars proposes no new interpretation and furnishes no new evidence, his brief account is perceptive and gracefully written. This makes it a useful, though scarcely earth-shattering, addition to the English literature on the topic. The second part of The Murdered Magicians ven- tures into more exotic territory-the legends, myths, and ghost stories that grew up about the Templars after their order's demise. The Templars may have been, by and large, a rather stodgy, unimaginative, self-centered lot while their order existed; Partner thinks, on the whole, that they were, and he is probably right. After they had ceased to exist, the imagination, and sometimes the sheer lunacy, of later generations supplied the Tem- plars with a romantic luster that reality notably lacked. Henry Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim turned the Templars into magicians in his De occulta philosophia, first published in 1531, and from that point on there was no stopping them. The subse- quent history of the Templars' reincarnation in various guises, most notably as a branch of the Masonic movement, is a fascinating study in the history of fantasy and fraud. Partner tells this tale with relish. He is considerably indebted, to be sure, to the researches of Le Forestier, Chevalier, and other earlier explorers of these labyrinths. But Partner's account has its own value as a worthwhile specimen of lively and intelligent intellectual history. JAMES A. BRUNDAGE University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee MODERN EUROPE P. J. MARSHALL and GLYNDWR WILLIAMS. The Great Map of Mankind: Perceptions of New Worlds in the Age of Enlightenment. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1982. Pp. 314. $22.50. One of the great themes of modern European intellectual history is the impact on the Western mind of new contacts and a new knowledge of unfamiliar cultures, especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As Europeans discovered the non-Western world a variety of responses proved possible. New knowledge could result in either greater understanding or greater incompre- hension; it could encourage a profound relativism or it could reassure Europeans in the superiority of their own values. In fact, it seems to have done something of all these things and simultaneously, although P. J. Marshall and Glyndwr Williams argue that by 1800, despite much new information, it was largely incomprehension and superiority that pre- dominated in England. They see the net result of increased contact in the development of a view that furnished a preparation and justification for nine- teenth-century imperialism. To be sure, the authors, both of whom have written previously on imperial themes, are no sim- ple reductionists. They allow that scholars and men of affairs have often had different motives and interests and that the development of "assumed" knowledge and the growth of imperial power were not simply interconnected and coordinate. They have tried to describe an interaction that extended over two centuries. In the first half of the book they tell of the English encounter with the higher civiliza- tions of Asia, from the Near East to India, China, and Japan; in the second, they show how England reacted to new knowledge of the simpler peoples of America, Africa, and the Pacific Ocean. In each part, there is some sense of a development of ideas from an utter to a relative incomprehension, from awe and admiration to a growing disenchantment and feelings of superiority. Exceptions are admitted only to prove the rule. The value of the attempt lies in its scope, which is wide, and its documentation, which is up-to-date. Even so, concentration on England is awkward, since so much of the information and attitudes of the English were shaped by the work of other Europeans; and the documentation, which takes account of much recent scholarship, is concentrated largely on well-known books. Much of the informa- tion and many of the quotations seem to derive from secondary accounts. The authors know and use some general works of intellectual history, like Lovejoy and Manuel, but this is not their forte. Like many others who have turned back to the eigh-</page></plain_text>
