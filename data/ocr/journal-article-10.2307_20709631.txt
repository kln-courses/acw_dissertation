<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Who cares about chickens having sex anyway?": Problems with sex education in the 1980's by Jean Levit?n In 1984 one sex educator who had never taught in the public schools and one an thropologist who had taught in the public schools but was new to the field of sex education joined forces to become the "team" responsible for evaluating the fam ily living/sex education program (FL/SE) for the New York City public school sys tem. The goals of the program, designed for students in grades K-12, are to assist pupils in developing attitudes which are necessary for them to become effective members of the family and society; pro vide information which can be used as a basis for responsible decision-making; help pupils understand the physiological changes that occur during their periods of growth and development; and help pupils develop a personal code of values that will enhance their self-esteem and serve as a guide for responsible behavior. Compared to other curricular programs whose goals may be specific and easily measured, the goals for the FL/SE program are very broad, not easily measured, and their accomplishment requires many years to achieve. Many of the issues in the program I am discussing are similar to those of most sex education programs. Family life/sex edu cation programs tend to have humanistic goals and are designed to be offered over a period of years, providing students with opportunities to learn about themselves and explore relevant issues that are deemed by educators to be "developmentally appro priate." Because of the nature of the con tent, FL/SE programs compete with fam ily, church, peers, and the media as sources of information for students. Curricula for FL/SE are scrutinized by educators, parents, religious leaders, and politicians to a degree seldom applied to other academic disciplines. Extraordinary efforts are usually made to ensure that a wide range of interest groups are satisfied with the curriculum content. Despite such efforts, great energy is usually required to appease the vocal minority opposed to FL/ SE who argue that sex education does not belong in the schools; it is their contention that parents should teach their children about sexuality. Students, on the other hand, generally report that accurate and compre hensive information and open dialogue about sexual issues is not available in their homes. The same arguments have been battled now for decades, and only a few regions in the United States have mandated sex education programs. In evaluating FL/SE programs, commu nities often expect that the problems of early onset of sexual activity, teen preg nancy, and high rates of sexually transmit ted diseases will be reduced. Critics sel dom note that these concerns grow from deep social problems which a single pro gram cannot cure. Further, researcher should ideally be able to examine changes in student knowledge, attitudes, and be havior over a long period of time, but the evaluation of the New York program took place at the conclusion of each school year and was limited to examining student gains in knowledge and change in attitudes after a brief exposure to the FL/SE program. Program Background The New York City school system is governed by one centralized Board of Education, yet the elementary and junior high schools are grouped into numerous school districts, each with its own school board and superintendent. The high schools function more independently than the dis tricts. In terms of the FL/SE program, all rely on the help of one centralized office responsible for facilitating program im plementation. This office provides presen tations to school boards, teacher and ad ministrator training, parent orientation and FL/SE content workshops, and it serves as a resource for teaching materials and strate gies useful in the classroom. The FL/SE program was first developed in the late 1960's, a time often credited as the period of a "sexual revolution." During the mid-1970's, the city experienced se vere financial problems, leading to cuts in the educational budget. As is often the case, because such programs are viewed as less essential than traditional academic areas, these budget cuts put the sex educa tion program in jeopardy. The FL/SE pro gram was reduced in many districts and totally eliminated in others. The minimal FL/SE content offered to junior high and senior high school students existed because of a longstanding state mandate for health education in the 8th and 11th grades. In the late 1970's, as more money be came available, it became possible to re vise the curriculum and institut? plans to re-introduce FL/SE in all grades K-12. The revised curriculum represented an attempt to provide FL/SE content in a comprehen sive, sequenced manner. An older version of the curriculum was revised by health education professionals and subsequently reviewed by representatives from the schools, parent groups, clergy, and health I agencies. Whether or not to offer the cur 23</page><page sequence="2">riculum was left to individual school dis tricts. The central board of education hoped that with adequate community preparation?i.e., an understanding of the goals and content of the program and an agreement that parents could have their children abstain from participation where objections existed?all school districts would be involved with the FL/SE pro gram by the end of a three-year period ending in 1987. In addition to substantial efforts made by the central board of educa tion to sell the program to the school dis tricts, a coalition of clergy, educators, and agencies concerned with children's health and welfare worked to gain local support. By the end of the 1986-87 school year, however, a number of districts had made little progress in bringing the program to their children. This resistance, coupled with the push to educate children about AIDS (a distinct effort but clearly related), resulted in the central board of education deciding to mandate FL/SE for all schools begin ning in the fall of 1987. In 1984, with the commitment by eleven school districts and the majority of the high schools to implement the revised curricu lum, the Board of Education initiated a massive teacher training program. Only those teachers who participated in the thirty hour training program were to be permitted to teach in ?he classroom. The training program was designed for volunteer teach ers to attend a summer workshop of twenty four hours, and later in the school year after a few months of teaching to complete the last six hours of the program. Keeping in mind that the FL/SE program was to be in all schools throughout the system, this commitment to teacher preparation was enormous. As a consequence, the training involved bringing 600-800 teachers to gether in one setting. An auditorium was sued for large group meetings, and class rooms were used for small group work shops of 30-40 teachers. The enormity of training required by the school system, along with budgetary and staffing con straints, prohibited using a more ideal train ing format. The training program included the dis tribution of the curriculum; didactic pres entations on such issues as anatomy and physiology, puberty, sexually transmitted diseases, and child abuse; the opportunity to review new films to be used in the class room; small group discussions on teachers' attitudes, reactions, and concerns; and as signments that had participating teachers develop and present lesson plans for their classes. The training was designed by pro ? essional health educators within the Board ? of Education and presented with the sup- j port of outside professionals in the field as well as experienced teachers within the school system. During a three-and-a-half-year period, | over three thousand teachers and adminis- j trators received training. The Board of j Education's optimal plan calls for having at least three trained teachers in each ele mentary school and five at each junior high; it is unlikely that such a goal can be reached, however, without additional money being allocated for training. Both teachers and trainers have been paid for their participation, and the city has allo cated only so much funding for training. With the health curriculum well-en trenched in the eleventh grade, high schools seem to have an adequate distribution of trained teachers. Specific requests for ad vanced training have been made and ad dressed on a small scale. Future problems may arise for the high schools, however, if the FL/SE curriculum is moved from the eleventh grade to the ninth grade. Student attrition has been cited as a major concern of the school system, yet ironically keep ing those students in school poses practical problems. In terms of FL/SE, if the curricu lum were to be moved to lower grades, more trained teachers would be needed to serve a greater student population. The Evaluation At the time of writing this article, we are in the process of conducting our fourth evaluation of the FL/SE program. Student testing has remained a critical part of the evaluation plan and is done using a pretest/ post-test format; because of the nature of the curriculum, there has never been a control group used as part of the research design. In various years we have surveyed teachers who have been formally trained to teach the curriculum about the quality of the training and their sense of the impact of the program on their students. We have surveyed parents to learn their views of the impact of the program on their children. We consistently interview district and school personnel about the implementa tion of the program. Whatremains the most personally rewarding, yet due to budgetary factors is limited, has been to visit schools and observe the program being carried out in the classroom. Some of our most emotionally-charged findings have not reached the written page because of their not being "representative" of the whole. Placing a statistic on certain experiences tied to the curriculum is often impossible. There is no way to quantify the words of a mother in the South Bronx about the curriculum's impact on her abil ity to talk with a son extremely distraught over the murder of his brother. As evaluators of the FL/SE program, we were to be objective and neither argue with nor support people we interviewed. The results of interviews, surveys, and student achievement tests indicated that the pro gram was succeeding. Students reported that they valued the opportunity to learn about themselves and discuss sexual is sues. Teachers reported that their students were learning new information, were bet ter able to share their thoughts, were treat ing others whose opinions differed from their own with greater tolerance, and felt freer to seek out adults for advice. School administrators reported that few if any parents had complained about the program at their school. We also became aware, however, of the difficulties inherent in implementation of sensitive curricula. There were religious groups opposed to the content and struc ture of the program who often attempted to prevent its being initiated. There were prob lems in finding the time and resources to develop the program within the school day, even where institutional support was in great evidence. There were communities where improving student literacy had to take precedence over offering a program that could enhance student self-esteem and perhaps help reduce teen pregnancy. There was the need to provide training and re sources to all teachers. And there was the need to reassure those who clung to the erroneous belief that talking honestly and forthrightly with students about sexual is sues encouraged them to become sexually active. Criticism of the placement of FL/SE content by grade level occurred as we more closely looked at test results from the fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades. While gains in student achievement were statistically sig nificant, pretest scores for knowledge re vealed that students already knew much of the information that was to be presented. A common complaint often voiced by younger students, "Who cares about chickens hav ing sex anyway?" reflected their desire for a more relevant program. The curriculum approach to discussing families by first examining animals was ill-received, as students recognized the need to be more direct. One elementary school teacher shared her frustration at having to deal with three pregnant sixth graders while being advised by the curriculum on how to sensi tively teach about menstruation. 24</page><page sequence="3">Finally, the FL/SE program has had to respond to the national attention being given to AIDS education. Fear of AIDS can have a negative effect on being able to teach about sexuality in the wholesome and posi tive light. Additionally, there is an interest ing conflict arising for those who recog nize the need to teach children about AIDS prevention, yet would prefer that birth control and homosexuality not be discussed in FL/SE programs. Our purpose at this point is to highlight two particular areas of concern we have with the program we evaluated?the abil ity of religious groups to interfere with the implementation of a program in the public school setting, and the heterosexist bias of the curriculum itself. Neither of these is sues were addressed in the evaluations we conducted. Religious opposition was de scribed by program administrators, but their main concern was how to work around it. We had had no involvement with the revi sion of the curriculum and therefore could not have any input toward ensuring that heterosexism was minimized. We both have little patience with male-dominated reli gious orthodoxies, sexism, and homopho bic reactions. Nonetheless, over time we came to appreciate the obstacles of pro gram implementation, witnessed the dedi cation of those working to put the program into the schools, and came to realize that what we wanted would unfortunately be viewed as too radical in the environment we were studying. Program Implementation Part of our job as evaluators was to be able to describe the various ways districts implemented the curriculum and what obstacles had to be overcome. Both sup port for and opposition to the program came from various religious groups. On a citywide basis, the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Jewish community had been vocal in opposing implementation of the curriculum. Each attacked the content of the program and argued that the school's agenda opposed family rights and respon sibilities and the role of religious institu tions. They further felt that the model of the nuclear family was not being taught as the norm, and while recognizing that many types of families "unfortunately" exist in the city, they insisted that the nuclear fam ily was the right and appropriate model to aspire to. On the other hand, tremendous religious community support was available from a religious coalition which actively worked with the Campaign Coalition for FL/SE. The Campaign Coalition organized to marshall support for the program and 3 worked to insure its implementation. The religious coalition represented priests, prot estant ministers, and rabbis who not only lent their support to the program but worked with their constituencies to help get the program into the schools. We also found conflict of opinion within the Black Muslim community. We inter viewed two Black Muslim mothers who were very supportive of the curriculum, and extremely active in getting the pro gram into their community's schools. Their particular concern was that the concept of the extended family be fully respected. Their definition of mother and father, for example, is not tied to biological parent hood nor nuclear family contexts. In an other district, despite high teen pregnancy rates in the area, some members of the Black Muslim community were strongly opposed to the curriculum being introduced in their schools. The irony when we examine the nega tive influence of religious groups is that the curriculum teaches respect for all religions and encourages students to talk with par ents and clergy about their beliefs. The FL/ SE program was designed to bridge school, family, and religion by encouraging stu dents to communicate with their family and clergy. Nonetheless, the vocal minor ity politically could not be ignored. Further frustrating was the fact that the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Jews in opposi tion were exercising power in a situation where their children were often not a part of the public school system. In an effort to include the community's concerns and reactions to the curriculum, districtwide and local school advisory councils were designed as an integral part of the implementation process. The coun cils would meet regularly to review and comment on materials used in the schools. In addition, parent workshops were offered citywide to orient parents to the goals of the program and to help train them to be come better parent educators. Aware that the majority of parents were in support of the program, the Board of Education was able to override opposition and mandate the program for all students, starting in the fall of 1987. With the mandate in place, new tactics had to be devised by the opposition to interfere with implementation. The Church 25</page><page sequence="4">played a role in diverting Board of Educa tion energy from helping new districts get the program into their schools to reviewing the content of all the books and resources for teachers provided in the curriculum. A furor began in the fall of 1987, when abook with a 1977 copyright was criticized for stating that anal intercourse could be expe rienced with no risk to health. That the curriculum's comprehensive bibliography included well-respected references, some of whose publication dates preceded the AIDS crisis, was of little interest to the opposition. Critics were able to use that one section of one book to marshall an attack on the whole curriculum, suggesting that other references could be providing misinformation. Instead of publishing an addendum to the curriculum bibliography advising teachers that some of the material might be out-of-date, particularly in light of new information on AIDS, the Board of Education pledged to review all materials provided on the teacher resource list. This project took the better part of a year and disrupted the work of two curriculum coor dinators and additional staff whose ener gies would have been much better directed toward curriculum implementation. Curriculum Concerns As stated in its introduction, the revised curriculum is intended to meet the chang ing needs of students in a time of rapid social change "through updated content, an examination of current societal and cul tural attitudes, and suggestions for improved classroom methodology to encourage the development of decision-making skills." From the beginning of the implementation effort, it was made clear by the central Board of Education that "various school communities will select content, activities, and materials from within the curriculum that are consistent with local need and atti tudes." The curriculum is organized for pre kindergarten to grade two, grades three and four, grades five and six, junior high school, and high school. Key concepts are pro vided for each grade category, along with recommended teaching strategies and sug gested resources. The elementary grades j introduce the concepts of families, friend- ? ship, sexual abuse, and puberty. Adoles cence, puberty, sexual health, responsibili ties associated with reproduction, and sex ual abuse are covered at the junior high school level. High school content expands on the physical aspects of puberty along with the psychosocial aspects, sexual health issues, sexual assault, and throughout an emphasis on decision-making and taking responsibility for behavior. One area of concern to us is the hcter osexist bias throughout the curriculum, j Historically, homosexuality has always ! been a controversial topic within sex edu cation programs. In the face of the religious opposition we have previously described I to the FL/SE program, it was especially controversial. Further confounding its pres entation has been the public's level of misinformation and reaction the the AIDS crisis. Homosexuality is first introduced as part of the junior high curriculum. The heter osexist perspective, however, is established at the elementary level by virtue of laying the whole foundation for talking about sex on the family. For example, the concept that "a man and a woman who love each other often marry and form a family" sets the stage for the heterosexual couple as the representation of love and family. Students are later taught that "in order for family life to continue, living things must mate and reproduce." The early grades use both chicken and fish families as a way to teach about the family. (This anthropomorphic approach is of questionable validity, yet commonly used as a "safe" way to intro duce family concepts.) It is sufficiently absurd to teach about animal families when human families are really the topic at hand, but at the same time, the groundwork is laid for posing reproduction as the sole accept able reason for having sex, with the impli cation that sex for non-procreative reasons is 'unnatural." Obviously, American cul ture accepts the concept that "natural sex" is that which could lead to procreation; thus teaching the truth that most sexual behavior is recreational in purpose would generally be thought of as too controver sial. The definition of family is broadened at the fifth-sixth grade level to "members of a household often unrelated who share re sponsibilities." This effort by the curricu lum to include every conceivable group in its definition of a family became the focus of conservative objection to the teaching of the family. Such a definition was intended by the designers of the curriculum to pro tect the self-esteem of each child by insur ing that each could feel a part of a family, regardless of family structure. There re mains, however, serious question as to whether teachers would convey acceptance of a gay household. Homosexuality is first presented explic itly at the junior-high level as part of teach ing that "puberty is a time of many changes." One statement for discussion to help stu dents understand feelings that accompany changes during puberty is "some boys and girls have close friendships with members of the same sex at a time when they are learning about relationships with the oppo site sex. These friendships may have an element of sexual experience in them but should not be confused with homosexual ity." In a program whose most successful feature has been providing a forum for youngsters to discuss pertinent issues, this approach fails miserably for gay youth. Discussion is shut down by such state ments, which suggest to the gay student that he or she is just going through a phase, not to be confused with homosexuality. By implication, homosexuality is negative and problematic. Homosexuals are defined as "individu als who have sexual experiences primarily with other individuals of the same sex. Homosexuals have no particular set of characteristics and therefore cannot be identified by body build, behavior, choice of profession, or hobbies. Teachers should be aware that students sometimes label their peers because their choice of activi ties may not fall within their sex roles as defined by society." The curriculum seems to be concerned with unfairly labelling adolescents as "homosexual" because of their activities, rather than focusing on the more serious issue of homophobia. Obviously, a curriculum that focuses on decision-making about dating, reproduc tion, marriage, etc. from a heterosexist perspective circumvents the needs of gay students through omission. This perspec tive defines such issues in terms of the male/female couple, and neglects the needs of gay and lesbian students. Amore radical perspective would not only discuss gay couples but would address the perspective that some choose the gay lifestyle as a reaction to the oppression of the "straight" world. Concluding Thoughts Today students live in an environment inundated with sexually explicit movies, videos, and television along with erotic images used to advertise all sorts of pro ducts. They are frequently confronted with sexual abuse; over one million teen preg nancies per year; high rates of sexually transmitted diseases; and AIDS, which can kill them because of their sexual behaviors. In this context, we find it inconceivable that any group could question the need for a comprehensive FL/SE program in the schools. We hold to the perspective that know ledge leads to more informed decision making and that students have the need and right to learn about themselves and to ex 26</page><page sequence="5">amine the impact that their sexuality has on their lives. The public schools remain an important forum for that learning, one that can address sexual issues in a comprehen sive manner along with all the learning that takes place in the home. The question remains, however, as to the quality of FL/SE programs and their overall impact on students. We have criti cized the program of one of the largest school systems in the country, yet it must be noted that there remain few places where FL/SE is well entrenched in the public schools. Getting a program started is diffi cult, but once started great things can hap pen. Effective leadership is needed to en sure that vocal minorities do not interfere with the wishes of the majority. Effective training is needed to ensure that teachers recognize their heterosexist biases and provide all students with an understanding of various sexual lifestyles. Resource lists can be inclusive enough so that all students know where they can turn for more infor mation and advice. It is disconcerting to admit that progress in the field of sex education has been so slow. Professionals are engaging in the same arguments with the opposition that were raised twenty or more years ago. Teen preg nancy rates and AIDS threaten to blur the fact that sexuality is a beautiful part of our being. When all is said and done, educators would do well to listen to the students themselves, who consistently report valu ing a program that helps them with the struggle of coming to terms with who they are.
