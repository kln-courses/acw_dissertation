Garland and Thomas C. Van Humbeck TES Ltd. Ottawa, Canada ABSTRACT Abdominal injury to automobile occupants can be caused by the lap portion of the belt restraint if it is not well deployed below the wearer's iliac spines. A new test device, capable of providing a quantitative measure of lap belt fit is described. Based on the stand- ard 3 dimensional "H-point machine", the device has been validated with a large number of oc- cupants seated in a wide variety of contemporary passenger cars. Procedures for employing the device are presented. ABDOMINAL INJURIES to restrained occupants of automobiles in collisions are not frequent. When they do occur however, they are often severe (1- 4)*. The mechanism by which such injuries are attributed to the lap portion of the restraint belt system is either submarining (5-8) or, simply inadvertant initial placement of the belt over the anterior superior iliac spine(s) (ASIS) (9). In a study of twenty-five abdominally in- jured front seat occupants, poor initial belt deployment around the wearer's lap was judged to be the primary reason for belt impingement on the abdomen (10). In a study of the inter-relationship between occupant parameters (anthropometrics, weight, clothing, etc.) and vehicle parameters (seat back angle, belt anchorage location, floor pan shape, dash configuration, etc.), it was sug- gested that conditions that provide good initial belt fit in the pelvic region would likely re- duce, to a great extent, any significant pos- sibility of submarining (11). *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper Thus to be able to measure in a reliable fashion the likely fit of the lap portion of a belt restraint becomes a worthwhile objective. DESIGN CONCEPTS The purpose of the Belt Configuration Test Device (BTD) is to enable the measurement of the absolute pelvic belt fit of any vehicle seat/belt system. The fit is determined by the position of the belt relative to the ASIS. This poses a problem because of the infinite number of human pelvic shapes and respective ASIS loca- tions. The device must therefore rate a specific vehicle seat/belt system for a portion of the population which fall within certain "normal" limits. With the above in mind, the following design strategies were developed: (1) utilize existing anthropomorphic test devices (ATD's) , (2) design and build a device which represents a human shape from mid-thigh to mid-abdomen in 2 or 3 dimensions, (3) use actual humans of specified shapes, and, (4) modify a three dimensional H-point machine such that it incorporates a pelvic shape and ASIS. An inspection of the contemporary ATD's revealed that their pelvic area do not resemble that of a human. Thus, to incorporate ASIS into an ATD would be of little use. The pelvic area would require complete reconstruction which would be complex and possibly reduce the overall usefulness of the ATD for other types of work. The design of a device from basic anthro- pometric considerations could have been executed in either 2 or 3 dimensions. A 2 dimensional device would be used on the left and right sides of the seat separately and would likely evaluate the seat/belt system by geometrical methods.

NEWMAN, ET AL. could include factors such as seat shape, com- pressibility, location, angle, seatbelt an- chorage locations, belt angles, etc. A 3 dimen- sional device designed specifically for belt fit evaluation seemed ideal, however, there is a lack of anthropometric data available for re- creation of specific 3 dimensional human shapes with ASIS. The use of live humans to test seat belt fit would seem to be valid. If a seat/belt system was a good fit for 5th and 95th percentile males and females, then it is probable that the system would also fit the general population as well. However, the 5th and 95th percentiles would have to refer to the ASIS locations and some pelvic area anthropometric factor. Unfortunately, there is insufficient data for selection of these specific humans and, even if there were, there would be obvious problems encountered in using living, hence changing, shapes for the design of seat/belt systems by numerous vehicle manufactu- rers. The 3 dimensional H-point machine is common- ly accepted and used by vehicle manufacturers for defining and measuring seating parameters. Its shape, weight and centre of gravity are such that it adequately represents the deflected seat contours of adult males and provides seat pene- tration equivalent to a 167 lb. male. A stan- dard H-point machine is shown in Figure 1 • Figure 1 : 3-Dimensional H-Point Machine When properly installed according to the SAE practice (12) it provides consistent positioning in any seating system. It was felt that the most promising design concept was to utilize an H- point machine and design different pelvic shapes/ASIS as add-on devices for use in belt fit measurements. The pelvic area modifications, when removed, would also permit normal operation and use of the H-point machine for other prog- rams. LAP FORM DEVELOPMENT In order to design the BTD, it was necessary to gather anthropometric data dealing with the pelvic area. This would then be used to deter- mine what is "normal" and what is "extreme" based on the general population. Large quantities of data were collected, however, none was found to be specific enough in the area of the pelvis, shape of the seat and back, or locations of the ASIS in the seated position. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has just completed the first 3 dimensionally accurate representation of a mid size U.S. male driver (13). No similar work has been completed for any other size or sex of U.S. driver or passenger. This situation exemplified the lack of currently available data. There was also an extreme shortage of data for Canadians and the measurements for different nationalities are widely varied. The greatest abundance of data was for U.S. military person- nel and this information is not expected to be representative of the Canadian passenger population. Using all applicable data found for Canadian, British and U.S. military or civilian people, the ranges of thigh, stomach, pelvic and ASIS measurements were broadly established for use in the design of the BTD. PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS To provide a "lap" for the H-point machine required modification to certain parts of the machine as well as the creation of a molded 3 dimensional form characterizing that area of the body. Various molding techniques were reviewed including those used in the production of pros- thetic devices. Eventually, a suitable method (employing San-Splint XR manufactured by Smith and Nephew Inc.) was developed and a variety of actual human shapes (of different sizes in various seating positions) was produced. Each form was produced by draping a heated sheet of this material over the subjects lap. Following detailed consideration of a number of subject variables (sex, age, size, posture, etc.) and vehicle variables (seat adjustability, cushion stiffness, seat back angle), it was finally decided to produce a single lap form from a Canadian male subject whose weight and height approximated that of the 50 percentile</page><page sequence="3">BELT CONFIGURATION TEST DEVICE 2.1107 Canadian adult (14). The mold was produced with the subject sitting in the passenger side of the bench seat in the mid-position of a late model North American automobile. The final form is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Final Lap Form It was determined that the hip angle quad- rant, buttock weights, back angle quadrant, back angle level and headroom probe would interfere with any lap form, as would the standard seat pan. Since the design strategy was to retain the capability of a normal H-point machine opera- tion, these components were removed and new components were fabricated to support the back pan and to locate the buttock weights. The modi- fied seat pan is illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3: Standard and Modified Seat Pan Initially hardware was fabricated with 3 dimensional adjustability to support the various pelvic shapes. The adjustability was incorpo- rated to aid in positioning of the pelvic molds and to facilitate adjustment of the molds to determine the optimum position for pelvic belt fit measurement. Finally, a fixed set of hardware was estab- lished and the Belt Configuration Test Device (BTD) was thus created. The complete collection of parts to convert an H-point machine to a BTD is shown in Figure 4. The fully assembled BTD is shown in Figure 5. Figure 4: Parts Required for H-Point Machine Conversion Figure 5: Belt Configuration Test Device Assembly</page><page sequence="4">2.1108 J. A* NEWMAN, ET AL* The BTD can be easily dismantled and the necessary components combined with those pre- viously removed, including the standard seat pan, and then be reassembled into a functional H-point machine. The BTD provides the same cen- tre of gravity location and mass as the H-point machine. TEST DEVICE EVALUATION In order to properly evaluate the performan- ce of the BTD with the average mold configuration, a test program was conducted which involved six human subjects and twelve vehicle configurations. The subjects were selec- ted to provide a reasonable representation of the Canadian adult population. (See Table 1). TABLE Is SUBJECT DESCRIPTIONS Code Sex Height (cm) Weight (cm) Age A M 172.7 81.6 22 B M 165.1 63.5 22 C M 186.7 97.5 19 D M 172.7 68.0 35 E M 185.4 74.8 24 F F 165.1 52.2 23 Some of this work was conducted on the occupant seating simulator shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Occupant Seating Simulator Once the BTD is correctly positioned in the seat, the seat belt system is attached and the lap belt allowed to fall across the pelvic shape. The torso belt is then pulled manually with an appropriate force to "snug up" the belt system. The torso belt should be pulled at approximately the same angle as it would be by an average sized seated occupant. The BTD has scales marked on the moulded pelvic surface in a longitudinal direction, relative to the thighs, through the left and right ASIS. The scales are marked in 0.5 cm increments, negative and positive, above and below the ASIS, respectively. With the belt properly positioned and snugged up on the pelvic shape, the belt fit measurement is simply the position of the top edge of the belt on the scale. The total belt fit score is a summation of four averaged measurements of the belt position on the left and right side of the pelvic shape with the BTD positioned in both the fully rear- ward and forward seating positions. Therefore, to obtain a total belt score for a vehicle, twelve independent measurements are required. The approximate time to complete a full series of belt fit measurements, with the BTD, is normally 10-15 minutes. The belt fit scores were obtained for the left and right side of the BTD and each subject, when properly positioned in the front and rear seating positions of each vehicle. The scores were measured three times each, since it had been previously determined that human subjects were not as repeatable as the BTD. The results of the BTD performance evalua- tion program are illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7: Comparison of Final BTD Configuration to Human Subjects The results show clearly that the average mold configuration of the BTD indicates a simi- lar trend in vehicle ranking as the average of the human subjects. The average total belt</page><page sequence="5">BELT CONFIGURATION TEST DEVICE 2.1109 score of all subjects for all vehicles was -1.57 cm, which compares to -3.39 cm for the BTD. The maximum error between the BTD and the average of the human subjects was -4.3 cm for vehicle #4. The average error, for all vehicles tested, was found to be -1 .82 cm. These errors are related to the total belt fit score which includes scores on the left and right sides for the front and rear seating positions. Therefore, the average expected error on any one measurement using the BTD, is -0.46 cm which is less than the measurement repeatability for human subjects of 0.60 cm. A further improvement can be obtained by relocating the ASIS on the mold surface and/or by slightly repositioning the mold on the BTD. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the average human scores and the corrected BTD scores. Figure 8: Comparison of Corrected BTD Belt Fit Scores to Human Subjects TEST METHOD In order to use the BTD to correctly eva- luate the pelvic belt fit of any vehicle, a proper test method was required. As with any test method, it was desired that it be simple, fast and repeatable. The entire method must be carried out six times in order to obtain three sets of scores for the front and rear seating positions. This was found to be necessary since the repeatabili- ty of the BTD was determined to be * 0.21 cm, on average for any one measurement, and three trials provided an average result with satisfac- tory error. Since the BTD is simply a modified H-point machine, the standard installation procedures outlined in SAE J826 (12) were utilized. These procedures are simple, and take little time to execute, once a person becomes familiar with them. The back and hip angles which are some- times required, or desired, are normally measur- ed with the angle quadrants on the H-point machine. These are removed on the BTD. How- ever, if required, these angles can be easily measured with an inclinometer. The SAE procedures do not contain explicit instructions for installing the device in the right front passenger seat. The procedures for the other front seats were used with the thigh and leg segments adjusted to the 10th percentile settings. These settings were selected to en- sure that the BTD could be installed in the most forward seating position of most vehicles with- out interference between the dash panel and knees. The feet and legs are positioned in a natural fashion, with the feet as far forward as possible to reduce the thigh angle. This was found to produce more repeatable results. The entire procedure is identical for the fully forward and rearward positions of the right front seat. The procedure must be re- peated in order to obtain three sets of scores. The measurements should be taken in the rearmost position first, then alternately from forward to rearward until the last set of scores is ob- tained in the most forward seating position. DEVELOPMENT OF ACCEPTABLE BELT FIT SCORES The purpose of the BTD is to evaluate the pelvic belt fit of any passenger vehicle by obtaining the total belt fit score as outlined in the previous section. This score must then be compared to some standard in order to deter- mine whether or not the fit is acceptable. An acceptable pelvic belt fit could be de- fined as one in which the entire adult passenger population would obtain an average total belt fit score of no less than -10 cm when slouching. This simply means that when slouched, the sub- jects would, on average, obtain a score of -2.5 cm for both sides and in the front and rear seating positions. This would place the centre lap line of the pelvic belt directly over the ASIS, since belt widths are approximately 5 cm. A belt fit of this nature can be considered to be a lenient criterion. It has been previously determined that the BTD produces total belt fit scores which are approximately 1.8 cm lower than those obtained by a sample of human subjects. Also, the over- all effect of slouching was a reduction in the total belt fit score of 9.8 cm. Therefore, to ensure a satisfactory fit, based on the lenient criteria and incorporating the BTD/human offset and the effect of slouching, a vehicle must obtain a minimum total belt fit score of -2 cm (-10 +9.8 -1.8) when evaluated with the BTD. The strict criterion for pelvic fit is that the top edge of the belt always lies on or below the ASIS. An acceptable belt fit, based on the strict criteria, would thus be one in which the entire adult passenger population would obtain an average total belt fit score of zero when slouched. This type of fit, when evaluated with</page><page sequence="6">2.1110 J. A. NEWMAN, ET AL. the BTD would require a score of +8 cm. This score, as with the lenient criteria score, in- cludes the effect of slouching and the BTD/human offset. A test program was conducted with the BTD to evaluate the pelvic belt fit of a large sample of vehicles. A total of 62 belt configurations were evaluated: 53 actual vehicles, 4 simulated vehicles with normal and modified belt anchorage locations, and one with its anchorages re- located. A typical set-up is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9: Typical BTD Test Set-Up The results are plotted in Figure 10 in descending order of belt fit. The lower curve represents the total belt scores obtained by the 53 actual vehicles and the normal belt configu- rations of the 4 simulated vehicles. The upper curve is the total belt scores obtained by the 4 simulated vehicles and one actual vehicle with a belt anchorages relocated to provide better pelvic fit. Figure 10 clearly illustrates the variations in pelvic belt fit among standard vehicles and the improvements which can be made by anchorage relocation. However, it should be noted that in order to provide the optimum pelvic belt fit for the full travel of the seat, the anchorages must be attached to, or move with, the seat so that the anchorage locations remain constant with respect to the seated occupant. Vehicles #1, 2 and 13 have the inboard belt anchorage attached to the seat and the effect is obvious from the results for vehicles #1 and 2. Vehicle #13 scored lower than vehicles #1 and 2, however, this is likely due to seat/interior design and outboard anchorage location. American vehicles having seat/interior design similar to vehicle #13, but without a seat-attached inboard ancho- rage, scored considerably lower. Figure 10 also illustrates the scores of the vehicles tested compared to the acceptable belt fit scores developed for the lenient and strict criteria. No vehicle or modified belt configuration scored on, or above the +8 cm strict criteria. This indicates that the average effect of slouching is too great and cannot be compensated for by belt geometry alone. Improvements in seat and interior design could reduce the effect of slouching such that the strict criterion score could be lowered. Figure 10: Total Belt Fit Scores of a Sample of Vehicles Some of the vehicles evaluated may actually score better than the strict criterion requirement if tested with certain subjects, and if their seat/interior design is beneficial in reducing the effect of slouching. However, the test procedure and strict criteria score were developed for the BTD and incorporate average effects indicated by samples of subjects and vehicles. This lack of absolute representation of human belt fit is inherent in the BTD design and test method. It should be noted that the opposite of the above could easily occur, which balances out the inaccuracies when viewing the usefullness of the BTD on a broader scale. The belt configurations with relocated anchorages, and the top five vehicles all scored on, or above, the lenient criterion acceptable belt fit score. The remainder of vehicles evaluated require some attention to their belt and/or seat/interior designs in order to raise their scores above the minimum requirement. SUMMARY Lap belt fit, which if improper can lead to abdominal injury in the event of collision, can now be quantified. A belt configuration test device, based on the standard H-point machine, has been developed. The BTD allows belt fit scores to be measured and compared to belt fit</page><page sequence="7">BELT CONFIGURATION TEST DEVICE 2.1111 criteria. Increased belt fit scores lead to a higher probability that the lap belt will be safely deployed below the wearer's iliac spines.
