The naive view of taxes is to see them as the device governments use to get the money to pay their living expenses. They are to a considerable extent that; but they are both less and more than that. Antiquity and immediacy concur to bring about that way of looking at them. Their function as a source of supply for the upkeep of kings marks both our ancestral histories. In England, the very origin of parliaments was intimately linked with the association of votes or grants of supply with petitions for royal assent to laws redressing grievances. In France, the introduction of tax farmers as entrepreneurial intermediaries between the royal revenue consumers and the producing populace was a main contributing cause to the revolution. The particulars of the historic con- nection are forgotten. The centuries-long conditioning to connect taxes and the material needs of governments persists. It is compounded for each taxpayer by his own interface with tax collection. We feel directly the transfer from our purses to that of the government. Our experience is that almost all that comes to us as income flows out in payment of personal or business expenses.

Inexact analogy and inherited thought patterns thus combine to divert attention from dis- crepancies between taxes and disbursements for government operations. For one thing, governments get money from other sources. One - borrowing - is perhaps only an apparent exception. Save for the catastrophe of repudiation, it isjust a time shift. Repayment must eventu- ally be made from funds obtained as a transferee in some capacity from the private sector with taxes the major transfer mechanism.1 But a significant supplement comes to the government as purveyor of various sorts of benefits - natural resources, goods, services, privileges. How to classify payment for things the law imposes on the payors deserves and will receive further consideration. One who seeks any of these for which a money charge is made pays not taxes but a price, whatever the formal terminology employed.2 Sales of crown lands, fares on public transportation systems, university tuition fees, are familiar traditional illustrations of a range of instances expanding with the proliferation of crown corporations and other forms of government enterprise. Charges of this kind seldom pay the full cost of the service which must depend on additions made on grounds of public policy from true tax funds. Yet, substantial in the aggregate, their existence forbids equating tax receipts with what is available for meeting government expenses. To such items, constitutional provisions dealing with taxation have therefore no applica- tion. Their constitutional position rests instead on whether the benefits purchased are of a kind which it is for the grantor government to be supplying under its grants of substantive competence.3 Much more important than non-tax contributions to government sup- ply are the non-income-generating aspects of taxation. These are of two orders. Measures enacted disguised as taxation may be tailored to burden and discourage disfavoured activities, with money really no object. Others may have fiscal consequences as the primary objective, not as providing the sinews of government but for controlling the general functioning of the economy. These radically different types call for separate comment. Customs duties although taxes have been recognized alike in Canada,4 1 Borrowing can also be used as a control mechanism for the general level of economic activity; see infra, at 296-7. 2 See A.-G.

What weight will be given the regulatory nature of a law cloaked as a tax is obscure in other contexts. There has been a disposition to condemn provincial7 or states measures of that kind as trespasses on areas of federal regulatory competence.9 Where federal statutes purporting to be tax laws are involved the record is less clear. An early inclination to recognize the reality of impermissible regu- lation behind the mask of taxation seems to have been abandoned. Letting the federal government strike at conduct within its regulatory compe- tence through a crippling tax rather than in some other way involves only a choice of means. But reliance on approval of that as authorizing whole- sale disregard of the true thrust of the legislation slurs over that critical consideration. Precedent does not call for blindness to the statute's character nor does principle. The axiom that the motives of the legislature are political in character hence not proper forjudicial examination, it has been argued, excludes any reference to effects and confines attention to the act's expressed command as the sole criterion of its nature.'0 The axiom one accepts. But motive is not the same as intent. While courts should refrain from querying the policies a legislature sees fit to pursue, they cannot, where a constitution specifies legislative competence, prop- erly refrain from examining whether those policy choices relate to matters belonging to the enacting legislature. Discretion about how to act is not discretion about what to act upon. Court scrutiny of the former is im- proper, of the latter a duty. All unpleasant consequences tend to discourage. Tax liability is an unpleasant consequence. Every situation which attracts a tax is to a degree discouraged. With some the discouragement bears no comparison with the attractiveness of the occasioning circumstance. Such include the re- ceipt of income, the ownership of property or its taking as a gift or from a decedent. But, where the alternatives are less lopsided, the deterrent potential of the tax liability becomes important. Its relative weight is always the question. Only if on balance it is so burdensome that it may be assumed few will care to incur it should it be condemned as being some- 5 A.-G.

But, where it is, the gist of the legislation is repression rather than taxation. Perhaps as good a test as any is to ask whether, the less the revenue collected, the more the statute's purpose will have been attained. The tax then is only a means to an end. To allow the means to justify a forbidden end is to abdicate judicial responsibility to guard the constitutionally established allocation of regulatory authority, not an inquiry into motives or policy. The proposed draft emphasizes at both the federal and the provincial levels that the taxing authority is to be used for money-raising and not for regulatory purposes. It does so by framing the power as one for 'the raising of money' in a particular way, namely, by taxation. Thus it departs from the Australian formula vesting parliament with the power of 'taxa- tion' simpliciter.11 It departs even more widely from the us constitution's bestowal of congressional power 'to lay and collect taxes ...' with its appen- dant 'to ... provide for the ... general welfare of the United States,'12 a phrase whose long-argued ambiguity finally has been resolved in favour of using it as an opening for federal interposition in internal state policies. It conforms instead to the pattern in the BNA Act,13 stressing the raising of revenue rather thanjust taxation. Its reiteration should jolt the courts out of the general neglect of that pattern. This does not deny that appropriate regulation can be packaged in the form of a tax. It should however be recognized and appraised for its regulatory substance and not for its form. One can tax by taxing. One can regulate by taxing. Only the former is comprehended by this grant. That is not a restriction to raising sums for meeting the expenses of government within the fields assigned. As appears elsewhere,b one main grant of law-making power to the central government is with respect to 'the structure and functioning of the economy.' Economists, while dis- agreeing about the independent efficacy and the mechanics of application of fiscal measures, are in general agreement that they are an important weapon in the arsenal of control over the general level of economic activity. Regarding inflation and depression as linked with the amount of funds available to the private sector, they see increases or decreases in them as influencing investment and spending decisions to the end of attaining or maintaining the level desired. Currency issue and the crea- 11 Section 55 ('Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provisions therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect'), apparently concerned with this problem, has been effectively eviscerated: see Nott Bros &amp; Co Ltd v Barkley (1925) 36 C.L.R. 20; Wynes, supra, chapter 2, note 5o, at 189. 12 Article I, s 8, cl 1 13 Ss91(3), 92(2) b The proposal with respect to the federal power of economic regulation was to be developed in succeeding chapters. The grant of power is set out supra, at 262.</page><page sequence="5">CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER FOR CANADA 297 tion of public debt are ways of feeding funds into the private sector, taxes a way of withdrawing them from it. Use for that purpose is regulation indeed but regulation within a field of competence assigned to the federal government. Admittedly withdrawal from the private sector will not occur if money is simply recycled through provincial expenditures to the private sector by the annual flow-through of all excess funds through the Canadian Equali- zation Council to the provinces.14 But the council in its allocations may be expected to take into account not only the provinces' current costs of current operations but their burden of indebtedness on past borrowings. To the extent that tax receipts are used to repay and retire existing obligations of government, federal or provincial, they can be deflationary. Moreover, even used for current programs, diversion to regional pockets, where human or other resources are unemployed or underemployed for lack of purchasing power from those where the opposite situation exists, ought not to modify substantially the utility of the tax as a regulator of over-all Canadian economic activity. Deflationary consequences are not relevant where the private sector is already starved for funds. The opera- tions of the council have primarily to do with spending not taxing and will be discussed more fully in that connection; but it does have a supporting role, which should be noted, in the use of taxes as a regulator of the level economic activity. The point is that for any substantive power entrusted to parliament the federal government should be able to use taxes as an instrument of regulation - but not for anything left to the provinces. What is unique about its use in this context is that the aim is the raising of revenue,just as with true taxes, but raising it to shift resources from the private sector, not to provide for expenses. The provinces too may employ taxation as the operating mechanism within their range of regulatory competence. So in what follows about the structuring of taxing power, it is not intended to foreclose inquiry into whether the taxing power is being exercised for permissible ends as elsewhere defined by the constitution. That is a preliminary requirement. The tax provisions are intended to operate in that setting. A viable federal system demands that each level of government possess its own power to tax. The central authority cannot have handouts. A major defect in the articles of confederation was felt to be the dependence of the Continental Congress on requisitions to the states to obtain supply. Even the European Economic Community has found it necessary to make a limited and timid 14 See infra, at 338-63.</page><page sequence="6">298 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL beginning to authorizing taxation by the central body - without of course derogating from national authority to tax in any way not creating trade barriers between members. Conversely where local taxing powers rest on statutory grant and not constitutional entitlement, the quality of discretionary use does not signify a federal relationship. Indeed delegation implies subordination and ne- gates the non-hierarchical status of governments which is the essence of that relationship.'5 Municipalities and specialized local authorities have traditionally and commonly been vested with some measure of tax au- tonomy. So have the regional regimes sometimes established in unitary states as decentralizing adaptations responding to local situations and sentiments.'6 The source, not the existence or extent, of the authority is critical. It is fully consistent with the federal principle for one level to undertake to opt to stay out of an area of jointly possessed taxing author- ity,'7 but not for it to be subject to being put out. Either may as part of the constitutional scheme be kept out of some of the taxable universe. In fact that is an ordinary feature of federal con- stitutions. All of them speak to the power to tax. All vest a taxing power in the central parliament. With but a single exception's they undertake some specification of the extent of authority to tax. Beyond that there is no uniformity of prescription. The principles of some measure of reciprocal immunity from each other's taxes"9 and of shielding the flow of inter- provincial and foreign commerce from the barrier potential inherent in provincial taxation20 are widely accepted; but in concrete expression they take different shapes, reflecting the different approaches to structuring the tax clauses in the constitutions. Otherwise there is the utmost variety. The differences may, however, be classified into two types. One relates to the way the constitution ex- presses limitations on the taxing power, the other to what level of govern- ment it concerns itself with. Limitations have been established sometimes by a formula, sometimes by a catalogue, or the two in combination. The formula technique stand- 15 Hodge v The Queen (1883) 9 App. Cas. 1 17 16 Eg, in Italy, where art i 19 of the constitution provides that the regions may levy their own taxes. 17 As provided in the Canadian federal-provincial tax rental agreements; see infra, at 324. 18 The Communist bloc countries describing themselves as federations - the USSR and Yugoslavia - which use a different mechanism than taxation for apportioning re- sources between the union and republic governments 19 See infra, at 307-12. 20 See infra, at 303-5.</page><page sequence="7">CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER FOR CANADA 299 ing alone is employed in Canada,21 the United States22 and Argentina,23 and is primarily relied on in Mexico.24 The procedure of cataloguing particular objects of taxation is slightly commoner. Sometimes federal and provincial lists mutually exclusive are appended as schedules.25 Rather more often the constitution embodies a specification of taxable matters exclusive or concurrent as the case may be.26 Viewed as a group, the lists are a mixed bag. The items included, in response to special situations of time and place one may surmise, appear partly to reflect some judgment about access to adequate resources for the recipient government but usually, insofar as they involve excise taxes which they generally do, about the appropriate location of regulatory authority. In any event they form a jumble of particulars to which tax measures must conform to be valid. Some countries which catalogue also state supple- mental principles; thus, in Brazil federal taxes must be uniform through- out the nation27 and in Venezuela, progressive rates are to be a princi- ple.28 Australia is unique in expressing no limitations either categorical or descriptive on its grant of taxing authority.29 All deal with the federal taxing power. Ordinarily only it has attracted attention in those constitutions which define the characteristics of au- thorized taxes instead of setting out lists of taxable subjects.30 Except for exclusions noted earlier31 regarding reciprocal immunities and impedi- ments to the free flow of trade, provincial taxing power is left implicit and its ambit at large. But all the constitutions which allocate tax subjects set 21 See the BNA Act, s 92(2) 22 See us Constitution, art I, s 8, cl i ('All Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.'); art I, s 9, cl 4 ('No capitation, or other direct tax shall be levied, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.'). 23 See Constitution of Argentina, art 67(2) (congress may levy 'direct taxes for a specified time and proportionately equal throughout the national territory, whenever the de- fense, security and the general welfare of the State so require'). 24 See Constitution of Mexico, art 73 (vii) (congress may 'levy the taxes necessary to cover the budget'). To this is joined a power to tax foreign commerce, government conces- sions, and natural resources (art 73 (xxix)). 25 Eg, Constitution of India, Seventh Schedule; Federal Constitution of Malaysia, Ninth Schedule 26 See Constitution of Brazil, c v; Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, art 105; Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, passim; Constitution of the Republic of Venezuela, arts 17, 18, 136(8), 137. 27 Constitution of Brazil, art 20 28 Constitution of the Republic of Venezuela, art 223 29 Other than the requirement that they 'not ... discriminate between states or parts of states': Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, s 5 (ii) 30 Those of Argentina, Australia, Mexico, and the United States 31 Supra, at 298</page><page sequence="8">300 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL bounds on what the member governments may tax, although Switzerland does so only by forbidding them to tax any of the range of subjects mentioned in article 41A. Canada is exceptional. While the BNA Act employs a formula and not a list, its constraint applies only to the provinces whose taxes must be 'direct ... within the Province in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial Purposes'32 while parliament may 'rais[e] money by any mode or system of Taxation.'33 In thus exposing provincial but not federal taxes to challenge as improper in kind, it goes beyond even those regimes which distribute fields of taxation between the two levels34 and still further beyond all those which like it undertake a generic limitation. Although the existence of its own taxing authority for each level is critical for federalism, a constitution goes far enough when it creates it for the common government and recognizes it either implicitly or still better by express confirmation for the members. The statement in any way of limitations, beyond those inherent in its really being a tax and in its not impinging on the functioning of the system to achieve a common purpose, only invites confusion and, in countries where statutes must survive judi- cial scrutiny for constitutionality, litigation. Regulatory powers without fixed boundaries would expose the citizen to a call for compliance with discordant directives or at the very least to wasteful duplication of en- forcement programs; tax overlaps have no such consequence. If different authorities elect to tax an identical subject the 'taxes may co-exist and be enforced without clashing'35 each reaping its part of the taxpayer's hold- ings without getting in the other's way. Attempts to parcel out the fields have all resulted in either piecemeal reallocation or a mishmash of court interpretations. The former has characterized constitutions which use the listing proce- dure. Central governments that are authorized to shift items out of the provincial list by legislative or constituent action36 use that power freely to whittle down inconvenient reservations to the provinces, at times 'in a more or less casual manner without reference to the Cabinets or legisla- tures of the States concerned.'37 32 S92(2) 33 S 91(3) 34 Some constitutions, eg those of Brazil (c v) and India (art. 248(2)), extend the federal taxing authority to any field not specified, but even they leave it open to question a federal law on the ground that it falls within the provincial list. 35 See the remarks of Lord Macmillan in Forbes v A.-G.

The classic example is the directness limitation under section 92(2) of the BNA Act, a provision which presents other difficulties of interpretation as well.39 The refinement which forbids sales taxes while accepting their Siamese twin, use taxes, exalts form over substance. Value-added taxes are clearly out of bounds under the formula - but why should a province not be allowed to choose that method of taxing? Two explanations suggest themselves, although none has to my knowl- edge been articulated, for so complicating the powers to tax with qualifications on its exercise. Both are misconceived attempts to deal with things functionally associated with but not an integral element of taxation. More sensitive than the courts to tax incidence as an instrument for stimulating or discouraging activity, the constitutional texts undertake a generally similar division of tax and of regulatory competence between the levels. That is more conspicuously the case where lists are sent out. They tend to specify for the provinces matters with a strong local flavour and for the federal authority those impinging on unified policy. Indeed there is a trace of this in the treatment of customs duties. Universally they are reserved to parliament - even in Australia40 where the tax power is otherwise unqualified. Once the choice is made which matters fall within which level's appropriate domain it is natural enough to seek to secure that level's quiet enjoyment of the field. The awkward indirectness of tax lumping is, however, ill-suited to that end. The proper approach is a realistic distinction of true taxes from regulatory measures wearing a tax mask. The latter should be sustained only if within the regulatory com- petence of the enacting government. True taxes on the other hand almost by definition will have no chilling effect on conduct. Their utility as as evidenced by the Swiss experience. There, where constitutional amendments must be approved by referendum, sweeping transfers out of the cantonal list have twice been rejected: see Aubert, supra, chapter 2, note 3, at 283-6. 38 The most notable example is amendment xvi to the us Constitution, overcoming the decision in Pollock v Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Co (1845) 157 U.s. 429, that the federal income tax involved there was a direct tax and, not being apportioned among the states, was unconstitutional. 39 The materials will be found in Laskin's Canadian Constitutional Law, supra, chapter 2, note 34, at 643-99. Identical language used in South Africa to define the taxing powers of provincial councils (see Union of South Africa Act 1909, s 85(i)) has been applied in an apparently contrary sense to that accepted in Canada (see Comm'rfor Inland Revenue v Royal Exchange Assurance Co [1925] A.D. 222; Clarke &amp; Co v De Waal N.O. [1922] A.D. 264), although both countries purport to acceptJohn Stuart Mill's test of directness as primary. 40 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, s 90</page><page sequence="10">302 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL revenue sources presupposes that the taxed activity continues to flourish. Classification which echoes regulatory considerations is beside the mark for pure money-gathering measures. It serves only to impose artificial rigidities frustrating and teasing normally resources-hungry govern- ments. The other plausible explanation of the restrictions placed on taxes is the circumstance that they are the prime means for financing the operations of government. With spending following getting, they are thought of as reciprocals. It is widely accepted, particularly in countries like Canada and the United States which used formula limitations, that the constitutional framers sought to estimate the amounts that would be needed for each level to meet its assigned responsibilities and to provide it with tax (and other) resources adequate for that purpose. This overlooked the non- revenue raising uses of taxation. More importantly, it projected both expenses and tax yields on the assumed continuance of conditions exist- ing at the time the constitution was framed. But both have changed and are bound to change in unforeseeable ways. With spending just as with regulatory authority, effective constitutional controls need to address themselves to the issue direct rather than treating it as a side effect of tax competence. It is therefore proposed to unfetter the taxing power recognized as belonging to both the federation and the members on the same general basis.41 The broad range allowed the dominion under the BNA Act should be open to the provinces save for customs duties. The language suggested is modelled on that now found in section 91(3). The position would then in effect be the same as that in Australia. A difference in the phraseology proposed emphasizes, however, that the provisions authorize only true 41 Cf Final Report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada ( 1972), at 48: RECOMMENDATIONS 54 Generally speaking and subject to recommendation 55 we endorse the principle that the Federal and Provincial Governments should have access to all fields of taxation. However, in order to bring about a division of revenues that may accurately reflect the priorities of each government, there should be Federal-Provincial consul- tations to determine the most equitable means of apportioning joint fields of taxation in the light of: A the projected responsibilities of each level of government in the immediate future; B the anticipated increases in their respective expenditures; c economic and administrative limitations, such as preserving sufficient leverage for the Federal Government, by means of its taxation system, to discharge effectively its function of managing the economy. 55 Provincial Legislatures should have the right to impose indirect taxes provided that they do not impede interprovincial or international trade and do not fall on persons resident in other Provinces. These limitations could be satisfied by tax collec- tion through an interprovincial or Federal Provincial collection agency, or by tax collection agreements.</page><page sequence="11">CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER FOR CANADA 303 tax measures as distinguished from regulatory legislation which must find its justification in other grants. Where Australia vests parliament with the power of 'taxation,' the proposed draft stresses 'the raising of revenue,' with taxation a subsidiary means to that end. In so doing, it only repeats the terms of section 91(3). True, they have been ignored. Blindness to them ought not to be repeated. There is no more excuse for erasing them by inattention than for bypassing any other provision of the constitution. Given the weight which they invite, they direct attention to the require- ment that only genuine tax legislation can pass muster under these grants. Confinement of the tax power to its proper content does not eliminate the need for serious attention to the matters to which it has been instru- mental - regulation and spending. For the former, that calls only for circumspection in recognizing a drtournement de pouvoir and in determin- ing, if regulation is indeed involved, to what legislature the relevant regulatory competence belongs. For the latter special arrangements must be designed to replace the haphazard empirical practices that have de- veloped in the absence of clear definition. Before entering on a consid- eration of such arrangements, however, let me deal with a brace of limitations on the taxing power itself which it seems desirable to retain. As was noted earlier, all existing federations confine the imposition of duties on imports to the federal legislative to the exclusion of the mem- bers. In those which follow the listing technique this is done by their mention in the federal list42 or by hiving them off from a concurrent list in an exclusive federal list.43 In those which leave tax fields generally or provincial tax fields specifically unlisted, the same result is attained by provisions variously formulated which predicate the existence of federal and negative provincial authority. Inter se exactions of a like character are also forbidden. Their dual fiscal and commercial nature has led to treating the prohibition sometimes in connection with the taxing sections of the constitution44 and sometimes from the viewpoint of internal freedom of trade.45 Australia with its requirement that '[o]n the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, 42 Eg, Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, art 73 43 Eg, BNA Act, s 122; Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, ss 86, go; Constitution of Mexico, arts 73 (xxxx), 17; us Constitution, art I, s 8, cl 1, s 1o, cl 2 (such duties not to be laid 'without the consent of Congress,' which has not in practice been given, and to be subject to 'the Revision and Control of the Congress'; amendment xxI has however apparently removed the constraints in the one instance of importation of intoxicating liquors: see State Board of Equalization v Young's Market Co (1936) 299 U.S. 59.) 44 Eg, Constitution of Mexico, art 1 17; Constitution of Argentina, arts io8, 67(1) 45 In Switzerland the immunity from such taxes would seem more properly to be based on art 31, stipulating freedom of trade throughout the Confederation except as au- thorized by the Federal Constitution, than on art 28 making customs a federal matter.</page><page sequence="12">304 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL commerce, and intercourse among the States ... shall be absolutely free'46 and Canada, in providing that '[a]ll Articles of the Growth, Produce or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall ... be admitted free into each of the other Provinces'47 take the latter approach. In the United States, the text of the constitution says nothing explicitly to the point, what with the Supreme Court's shrinkage of 'imports' in article I, clause 1o, to mean only goods brought in from outside.48 Nevertheless, '[i]mports and duties are placed beyond the power of a state, without the mention of an exception, by the provision committing commerce of that order to the powers of the Congress.'49 All three congruent confederations thus focus on the free flow of internal trade rather than on customs being a species of tax. Their inherent operation as trade barriers dictates the existence and extent of the limits on the availability of international and interprovincial customs duties. To allow the provinces to exact either would be to create a loophole for regulating commercial activity which it is generally accepted should be immune from their control. The reasons for immunity are not quite the same for interprovincial as for international commerce. A necessary quality of even the most pallid confederation is equal receptiveness by each member to goods coming from any other as for local ones. Indeed still looser associations sometimes have that objective. The European Economic Community, herein suggested with some additions as the general blueprint for a new constitution, has as a leading principle 'the elimination as between Member States of customs duties and of quantitative restrictions in regard to the importation and exportation of goods, as well as all other measures with equivalent effect.'50 They were prohibited51 with a grace period for their elimination which was in fact accelerated by the member states.52 A blend of economic and political considerations supports free move- ment between members. From the economic point of view, a major inducement for coming together is the belief that an enlarged market will benefit both sellers and buyers, the one by making possible economies of scale and more efficient investment decisions, the other by the benefits to be expected from the increase in competing suppliers. Politically, provin- cially imposed exactions would lead to friction and retaliation, federal ones could fairly be seen as cheating the members of a principal material 46 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, s 92 47 BNA Act, s 121 48 See Hooven &amp; Allison Co v Evatt (1945) 324 U.s. 652. 49 See Baldwin v G.A.F.

For either level to tax the movement of goods between members would disrupt the common commitment to market reciprocity. The United States by narrowly reading 'imports' has perhaps opened the way for federal internal customs duties (without so far travelling it); if it is the commerce clause that constrains the states, the reference of internal customs to it rather than to taxation suggests that the uniformity limitation established for federal indirect taxation has no bearing and hence exposes the states to the discrimination possible in the plenary discretion under the commerce clause.53 Congress, it may be said, would never do it; but many measures long supposed to be just as alien to congressional decision have been adopted and sustained. By their provi- sions foreclosing any such possibility, Australia and Canada have acted prudently. That should continue. The Australian formula is preferable. It condemns barriers to both entry and exit while Canada deals only with free admission. Foreign commerce is different. Here too customs duties are entangled with commercial regulation. However, unlike internal customs they do not prejudice the access of the production of any province to the market in any other province, with the consequent risk of domestic discord. What- ever the level, protection will operate only against foreigners. Any ad- vantage will extend equally to the same produce of all provinces. The reasons for forbidding internal customs therefore do not apply. Rather the vice lies in breaching the necessarily unitary control of the central government over external relations. That requirement which dictates withholding power from the provinces permits and even presumes its existence in parliament. Clearly it may be and visibly has been exercised so as to produce or aggravate regional economic disparities. But commercial regulation generally, notjust the tariff, has been misused thus. The perils and the benefits of federal control attach to all alike. The critical feature of import duties is their function as a bargaining chip in external affairs. The considerations that support giving competence there to parliament inter- sect with those assigning trade regulation to it. Federal systems without exception reflect this. They all vest in the central legislature authority here while denying it to the members and usually denying to both authority to subject interprovincial transactions to customs duties. No departure from that widely accepted pattern is proposed. However, a special provision, elsewhere set out,54 undertakes to cancel to some degree the capacity of customs duties for prejudicing provinces or regions. Export duties are not the mirror image they seem to be. Addressed to 53 Cf New England Divisions Case (1923), 261 U.s. 184. 54 See the discussion of the role of the Canadian Equalization Council, infra, at 338-63- The proceeds of customs duties would form part of a fund for distribution to the provinces.</page><page sequence="14">306 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL goods moving out of the country, they do, like import duties, implicate both external affairs and commercial regulation. Federal competence would seem proper just as it is for the latter. Indeed it is sometimes expressly recognized."5 The United States, how- ever, in terms forbids them.56 Neither Australia nor Canada does. With economies largely dependent as both have been on exportation of pri- mary products, neither has seen much occasion to discourage it by im- posing them. In principle, parliament's power seems to rest here on the same grounds as that over import duties. The capacity for selective appli- cation prejudicing a province or region which led to the us prohibition57 clearly exists but the two are just alike in that respect. The us example, withdrawing one option for regulating international trade in one special way, is an aberration which should not be followed. Should provincial export duties be permitted? Applicable only to things moving out of Canada, what with the constitutional guarantee of inter- provincial free trade, they would not threaten harmonious relations between the members. Still they would have elements of regulation of external commerce, something which is not a provincial function. That would likely be only a side effect. The primary objective would be stimu- lation of domestic enterprise by establishing a split-level price scale for local resources."8 With industrial development and the incident increase of employment opportunity a proper subject for provincial action, export duties designed to that end, while they would be, as argued earlier, regulatory and not truly fiscal measures, would be regulations of a matter within provincial competence. Viewed formally as taxes, they like other taxes should be equally available to the provinces and the central govern- ment. Viewed substantially as regulations, they would embody policies validly provincial. In contrast with customs on imports, as to which dis- couragement of external trade is the critical prerequisite and domestic impact a collateral contingent hope, export duties are only auxiliary to the achievement of an internal program, which would be pursued without them but which they may be thought to further. The proposed restriction on the provinces is therefore confined to customs on imports only. This represents a clear departure from existing practice. The us con- stitution forbids state duties without congressional assent and even then subject to qualifications on a parity for import and export, except that the 55 Eg, Constitution of Mexico, art 73 (xxix); Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confedera- tion, art 28; Constitution of India, schedule 7, list 1, item 83. 56 us constitution, art I, s 9, cl 5 ('No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.') 57 See Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States ofAmerica (2d ed 1 829), at 1 1 5- i6. 58 Because of the interprovincial free trade guarantee, the more favourable terms would be available to industry wherever located in Canada.</page><page sequence="15">CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER FOR CANADA 307 latter are permitted for those 'absolutely necessary for executing inspec- tion laws.'59 Australia speaks more obliquely, making 'the power of Par- liament to impose duties of customs ... exclusive.'60 In Canada, a textual basis is wholly lacking unless a hint of one is to be found in transitional permissions;61 but the limitation to 'direct taxation' has been invoked to ban such duties.62 The practice seems to reflect only an undeliberated assimilation of import and export duties. It should be discarded, given the difference between them. Admittedly, provincial export duties would impinge on external com- merce. Regulation of that is for the central, not the member governments. This creates no real dilemma with the assumed continuance of the con- stitutional principles now familiar as the aspect doctrine and, modified in a manner not here relevant, paramountcy. As measures for the promo- tion of industrial activity, they would be within provincial legislative competence. Yet parliament could make whatever laws about external commerce it chooses and risks no loss of its options in dealing with international relations. Any laws made by parliament would, on para- mountcy principles, suspend the operation of incompatible provincial measures. If none are made, why should provincial discretion be cur- tailed? The accommodations needed to respect the status of non-hierarchical authorities present in the same territory occur in many contexts. Even in the tax area, they are not confined to the components of federations. There are analogies for instance, in medieval church-state relations63 and in the rules of international law about state-owned property. The root sentiments there operative probably support its having been taken for granted that some measure of reciprocal tax immunity be extended. There seems to have been no systematic exposition of the reasons. Perhaps the minor amounts initially involved relative to the total available tax sources made the costs of concession seem less than those of maintaining a bone of contention between fairly matched power centres which had to coexist. Between monarchs of newly emerging nation states, feelings of professional courtesy may have combined with recognizing the possibility of a return in kind to establish diplomatic practice. When federal states came to be formed and their constitutions written, these 59 Art I, s 1o, cl 2 60 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, s 9o.

The theory of dual sovereignty on which the us constitution was based would suggest that the states and the union each treat the other much as either would treat any outside sovereign.64 In Canada and Australia, the crown remained the single sovereign but the freedom from local taxation which inhered to it before the conferring of dominion status continued as a crown attribute at each level. In each case history supplies the reasonable justification which nobody bothered to articulate. The best argument for a modicum of abstention, it may be argued, is precisely the fact that it has encountered no argument. Canada and Australia wrote the principle into their constitutions. The phrasing differs slightly. In the former, 'No Lands or Property belonging to Canada or to any Province shall be liable to Taxation.'65 In the latter, 'A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Common- wealth ... impose any tax of any kind on property belonging to the Commonwealth nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property belonging to a State.'66 The us constitution is silent on the point. The articles of confederation had provided that 'no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any state, on the property of the United States or either of them'67 and, with the Continental Congress having no power to tax, the exemption was effectively reciprocal. There was no equivalent in the successor constitu- tion. Nor was the dropping of it put in issue. It was not an item in any of the numerous accompanying proposals for amendment made in connec- tion with state ratifications.Judicial construction restored the immunity of federal property from state taxes.68 The converse has never come up for decision. Because of the impracticability of apportionment, required for direct taxes, there has been no federal property taxation. There are dicta intimating that, should the occasion arise, state property could not be subjected to it.69 Yet neither the textual nor the doctrinal shields protect fully against taxation by the other level. They affect only property taxation. Their scope is thus more limited than that of some other federal constitutions, such as the Brazilian provi- sion that 'The Union, the States, and the Municipalities are forbidden ... 64 See New York v U.S. (1946) 326 U.s. 572, at 587 (per Stone cj), 594-5 (per Douglasj). 65 BNAAct, s 125 66 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, si 114 67 Art Iv, cl I 68 Clallam County v U.S. (1923) 263 u.s. 341 ; Van Brocklin v Tennessee (1886) 117 U.s. 151 69 New York v U.S., supra note 64.</page><page sequence="17">CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER FOR CANADA 309 (c) to tax income, goods or services of each other.'70 The special situation of customs duties, demandable from states or provinces not as taxes but as commercial regulations, has been noted." Sales and use taxes where a government is the seller or user, death duties on bequests to it, stamp duties on conveyances by or to it, levies imposed on activity involved in its execution of the laws, income taxes on government businesses have in- vited claims to exemption. Clearly none comes within the general under- standing of a property tax. In the United States, an abundant jurispru- dence has sheltered the federal government from most72 but not all73 such state taxes but has subjected the states to most74 but not all75 similar federal taxes. The meagre Australian authority holding states liable to a federal payroll tax76 and the commonwealth to a state stamp duty on land transfers77 seems more to equate the position of the two levels. No Cana- dian authority squarely in point has been discovered.78 The significance of the textual shield for property is probably not so much the immunization of property it directly decrees as its grounding negative implication as to other taxes. The considerations that induce the widespread exemption of property of religious and eleemosynary organi- zations, fortified by those noted as arising from the concepts of dual sovereignty and of succession to the imperial crown, could have been expected to relieve the property owned by each level of the burden of taxation as they have in fact relieved it with or without mention. The value of property publicly owned moreover is a small fraction of the aggregate of property values. In situations where it is significant, the governmental owner often relinquishes its favoured position by agreeing to compensa- tory payments. In recognizing the special status of such property, there is no important impairment of the tax base. That is less true of some of the other forms of taxation. With the 70 Art 32 71 Supra, notes 4-6 and accompanying text 72 See Schwartz, American Constitutional Law (1955), at 179-81. 73 States may impose inheritance taxes upon bequests to the federal government: U.S. v Perkins (1896) 163 u.s. 625- 74 Eg, New York v U.S., supra note 24; South Carolina v U.S. (1905) 109 U.s. 437 75 Ambrossini v U.S. (1902) 187 U.s. 1 76 Victoria v The Commonwealth (1971) 122 C.L.R. 353 77 The Commonwealth v New South Wales (1918) 25 C.L.R. 325; but cf Re Gardner (1919) 15 Tas.

The justices treated the claim for repayment as an authorized tariff item and not as a tax claim by the company, with only one judge dealing in passing with the operation of s 125-</page><page sequence="18">310 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAWJOURNAL increased volume of government borrowings, tax exemption of their obligations is being challenged by economists as distorting investment decisions and by non-economists as a tax escape valve for wealth. The spread of government activity into businesses formerly left to private enterprise diverts income flows which would have been exposed to in- come taxation. The historic pattern of tax exemption is not directly relevant to either case. The search for new revenue sources leads to analogizing these important items to comparable ones in the private sector with which they compete. No clear principle has yet emerged. What vague indications there are rather suggest that the presence of an express exempting clause decreases the range of exemption outside the property context. In the United States, where the constitution is silent and all depends on implication, the notion grows that federal taxation spares state activities as a matter of legislative grace rather than of constitutional compulsion. That the converse is not true is based on the inadequate ground of paramountcy - inadequate in that paramountcy operates as regards reg- ulatory and not fiscal measures. As with foreign sovereign immunity, the law seems to be groping toward a necessarily nebulous distinction between functions properly governmental and those of an entrepreneurial character, with the implied immunity of states from federal taxes confined to the former. In Australia's leading case,'" different emphases by different justices spawned a litter of statements which are all in accord but do not greatly enlighten. The tax there in issue not being a property tax was not in violation of any 'express provision' of the constitution80 and the general proposition that the states have a constitutional protection against the exercise of the taxing power cannot be accepted.81 On the other hand, 'section 1 14 is not an exhaustive statement of the protection' of one level from another's taxes;82 there is room for constitutional implication of other exemptions.83 A commonwealth tax on the revenue of a state was proposed as within the implied immunity.84 More generally, a criterion was mentioned, reminiscent of though perhaps somewhat weaker than the us view of exemption for the state's essential functions,85 not unlike the Canadian doctrine guarding dominion companies against sterilization 79 Victoria v The Commonwealth, supra note 76 80 Ibid, at 369 (per Barwick cj) 81 Ibid, at 409 (per Walshj) 82 Ibid, at 393 (per Menziesj) 83 Ibid, at 404 (per Windeyerj) 84 Ibid 85 Ibid, at 392-3 (per Menziesj) (laws which 'operate to interfere with the performance by the State of its constitutional functions')</page><page sequence="19">CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER FOR CANADA 311 or destruction of their powers and capacities86 which was indeed expressly adduced as an analogy.87 All that can safely be concluded is that the Australian clause has left room for implication of some additional im- munity but an immunity certainly no broader and perhaps somewhat narrower than that existing under the silent us constitution. Finally, in Canada, there is only the obiter observation, 'il y a une exception toutefois. C'est celle de l'article 125 ... mais cette exception mime implique a mon sens le droit reciproque de taxer par ailleurs la Couronne.'88 If mention of exemption has any effect, it seems to restrict its range, a result consistent with the underlying logic ofexpressio unius. Such possibil- ity of further implication as the commonwealth opinions admit seems surely no broader and maybe a bit narrower than that under the hazy us judicial construct. It would no doubt be possible to incorporate a blanket reciprocal immunity. But that would be imprudent if investment tax shelters are to be avoided or sprawling government entrepreneurship is apprehended. The insertion of an express provision seems desirable, with the hope that it would operate in the manner suggested in Australia. With government property and only government property exempt from taxation, a preliminary question will always be which government's rules shall govern the determination of whether the kind of relation existing with the assessed parcel shall be classified as a property interest. Under present Canadian law, 'property (and civil rights)' is generally a matter for provincial qualification.89 'The Public (i.e. federal) (Debt and) Property' is however an exception.90 Except for money disbursements, no change in this respect is proposed. Hence in the first instance the federal government and the provinces would each decide that question by its own rules and through its own organs. Any challenge to that decision would go to the tribunal created to deal with jurisdictional conflicts between the two levels of government. A difference between the Australian and the Canadian provisions calls for comment. Under the former, only cross-level property taxation is forbidden. Under the latter, the exempt quality inheres in the property. Thus taxation by sibling states or provinces comes within the Canadian but not the Australian ban. The United States, where the whole matter rests on implication, echoes Australia in holding property of one state which is located in another taxable by the latter. 86 See Great West Saddlery Co v The King [1921] 2 A.C. 9 1 87 Victoria v The Commonwealth, supra note 76, at 398 (per Windeyerj) 88 R v Bell Telephone Co, supra note 78, at 2 lo (per Letourneauj) 89 But cfJohnson v A.-G.

The other by discriminating im- plies that the autonomous status of the central government is of greater dignity than that of the members.
