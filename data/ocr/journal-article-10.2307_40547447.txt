<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory: The Origin of Society and of Guilt BY LARRY DAVID NACHMAN So thoroughly has psychoanalysis, the method and its findings, captured the contemporary imagination and insinuated itself into many branches of inquiry, that it takes a special effort to remind oneself that psychoanalysis is less than a century old and that it was only in the years immediately preceding the First World War that it expanded beyond its original exclusively clinical focus to a concern with the social life of man. We have since then seen the creation of new sub-disciplines and new political theories, so that psychoanalysis has become, even more so than forty years ago when W.H. Auden coined the phrase, "a whole climate of opinion." It is no wonder that those who think and write seriously about society and politics should draw upon this wealth of concepts and analytical tools. But psychoanalysis is more than a method and a special terminology. It is also a theory about the nature of the human individual; a theory of considerable complexity which is rich in implications. I should like in this paper to suggest a framework in which the question of the relationship between psychoanalysis and social theory may become less diffuse and more focused. We may begin with Rousseau and one or two related writers. In his Confessions, Rousseau remarked that the core of his theory of human nature and politics was the conviction "that everything was rooted in politics and that, whatever might be attempted, no people would ever be other than the nature of the government made them."1 This assertion of the priority of politics in human life is the first principle of all modern leftist thought. Its appearance marks the termination of the Christian worldview which denied the claim that man, the creature of God, has * I wish to thank Robert Boyers for the extensive critical assistance he gave me in the preparation of this work. 1 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Confessions, Penguin Books, 1953.</page><page sequence="2">66 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN the power to alter human nature. As long as Christianity dominated thought, neither the good nor the evil in man could totally be ascribed to the quality of social institutions. Nor could the Christian, who bore moral obligations to God, ever accept unconditionally the moral authority of the state. The secularization of thought and institutions was the historical pre-condition of Rousseau's dictum. In the absence of God, man now inhabited a moral universe in which he alone dwelt. The explanation of the humanity of man was to be found in social and political institutions. This position, as further developed by Hegel, Marx and the French sociologists, has persisted as one of the basic models by which modern man organizes his thought about the world; i.e., the social and political constitute the basic reality of human life. The principal mode of investigating man is history or sociology. An alternative and competing secular account of the nature of man was developed in the nineteenth century. Schopenhauer may be taken as a representative of this newer position. The history of the human race, the many varying forms of human life in different countries and centuries, all this is only the accidental form of the phenomenon of the Idea.2 What is primary is the subjective life of man which is a function of a human nature admitting no fundamental change. Man is what he always was and will ever be. The institutions of society and politics are the transitory and unessential products of the human personality. This philosophy often develops out of a direct attack on the Rousseauian position. Schopenhauer, as well as Kierkegaard, explicitly opposed Hegel's historical view of the human being. This subjectivist philosophy which takes the self as its starting-point may be regarded as an attempt to rescue the values inherent in the Christian idea of the soul from a philosophy which regards the human being as a mere creature of society. This position, as further developed by Nietzsche and the existentialists, provides us with the other model of the reality of human life. The principal mode of investigating man is psychology. The presence of these opposing worldviews raises important substantive and methodological questions. Is the starting-point for the study of man to be the human individual or the social and political structure? Is the human being purely a product of society or is society 2 Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Falcon's Wing Press, Colorado 1958, Vol. 1, p. 182.</page><page sequence="3">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 67 itself a reflection of the human personality? These alternatives are stated starkly as either-or, for indeed they have appeared so for many of the major thinkers of the modern secular age. Psychoanalytic theory introduced a major new account of the human individual. It is not surprising that there would come a time when it would be forced to address the philosophic issues raised by the secularization of modern life. The question of the relationship of psychoanalysis and social theory is the methodological counterpart to the question of the relationship of the individual and society. It was Freud, of course, who led the way in the examination of this relationship. Just as Freud remains the point of departure for all subsequent work on psychoanalytic theory, his own particular resolution of the implications of psychoanalysis for social theory has continued to influence those who subsequently have attempted to grapple with these issues. In 1912 and 1913, Freud published the four essays which he called, collectively, Totem and Taboo, and it is this work primarily that we must first examine. To do so is to discover that the positions taken by Freud become more intelligible when they are seen as responses to questions which were thrust upon him and which he felt he could not ignore. A study of Totem and Taboo and of its intellectual background will confront social and historical issues, some of which appear remote from Freud's original preoccupations. Totem and Taboo is a depiction of the origins of social life. Freud - as well as Jung and Durkheim who will appear prominently in these pages - turned to the study of primitive cultures not because of the intrinsic interest of such cultures but because he believed that he could resolve some basic questions concerning the nature of man by an examination of the origins of major features of human life. Freud investigated the early history of man because he suspected that the study of the beginnings of things would disclose something significant about the abiding roots of human existence, something fundamental and permanently important about the nature of man. In his excursion into 'anthropology', Freud, of course, concentrated on those matters which psychoanalysis had revealed to be decisive for the life of the individual. In the first three of the Totem and Taboo essays, he argued that the most primitive forms of society, morals, and religion, the totemic systems and the taboos, were all based on an unexpressed goal of avoiding incest. The basic structures of organized human life were revealed to lie in the same ambivalence</page><page sequence="4">68 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN of contending forces which had produced the Oedipus conflict in the individual. The investigation of the earliest strata of human history therefore led back to the identical material upon which psychoanalytic theory had been built. But now Freud had to face a problem which he could ignore only so long as he limited himself to the psychology of individuals. In the last of the Totem and Taboo essays, he turned to the question of the origin of the prohibition against incest. Until now, he could take for granted the existence of strong prohibitions against incest which came into conflict with the child's natural incestuous desires. Such prohibitions were manifestly present in his society. However, when he turned his attention to the foundations of social life, the incest prohibition necessarily became problematical. If the elementary forms of social life were erected as barriers against incest, then one may reasonably ask why primitive man felt so strong a need for prohibition and for its vigorous enforcement. If any issue may be considered to stand as a focal point of Freud's thought, it is this one. Psychoanalysis had disclosed that the human personality emerged from a conflict between the infantile desire for the mother, with its corollary wish to slay and replace the father, and a repression of the very consciousness of these desires. For Freud, "the doctrine of repression is the foundation stone upon which the whole structure of psychoanalysis rests."3 The conflict which gives rise to repression is not just any of the conceivable conflicts which can arise as the child's wishes are contradicted by the prohibitions imposed by adults. Why did the Oedipal situation take on the character of the conclusive and determining event in psychic life? Why does this one situation constellate around itself the varied and divergent trends of the inner life of the developing child? These questions which appear to belong to individual rather than social psychology point us back to the origins of the incest taboo. Although it is decisive in the life of every individual, how it assumed its strength and importance cannot be discovered by an analysis of an individual, for whom the taboo is a datum of life. Freud was drawn irresistibly backwards in time in order to find the first step in the process which produced homo neuroticus. There were two explanations of the origin of the horror of incest which Freud immediately rejected. The first was that the ban on 3 S.E. - The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Edited and translated by James Strachey, London: Hogarth Press, 1953 - . S.E., Vol. XIV, p. 16.</page><page sequence="5">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 69 incest was the result of a rational discovery of the deleterious consequences of inbreeding. The incest taboo, Freud believed, predated the domestication of animals and the acquisition of knowledge about breeding. Moreover, the capacity and willingness to forego current pleasure for the sake of a future goal was beyond the power of early man. The second explanation for the prohibition was that it reflected an innate repugnance to incest. Freud denied the existence of such an instinctual aversion. His own work in psychoanalysis had, of course, disclosed to him that the earliest object-choice of the child was, in fact, a parent or parent-surrogate. Freud borrowed a point raised by James Frazer, to wit, if there is a strong instinctual aversion, its very strength would suffice to prevent incest, it would not need to be supported by social controls. These two explanations are paradigms of types of social thought which Freud would never find plausible or acceptable. Freud could never agree that the rules and morality which govern the life of man in society were the result of rational discoveries which directed man to a better life. In society as in the life of the individual, Freud believed that reason, in itself, could never be decisive. Reason alone could not master the power of instinctual drives. Nor could he entertain that other possibility, that morality reflected instinctual trends in the human mind. For him, it was always the case that morality opposed the instincts. The controls which society had established were controls on the instincts; the stronger the controls, the stronger the instincts. Freud then offered his own strange and puzzling solution to the problem of the origin of the incest taboo. He presented his now familiar account of the primal horde and the primal slaying. Originally, the human being had no organized social life and lived in family hordes dominated by the fierce rule of the father, who owned all the goods and monopolized all the women. His sons one day banded together and slew him. Afterwards, they were remorseful, for they had in fact loved their father; but as long as he was alive their love for him was masked and concealed by the hatred they felt for the dreaded tyrant. The brothers re-established the rules laid down by the father but now these rules were not maintained merely by external force. The code of the father was internalized and this internalization was the birth of conscience, the origin of society, religion, morality and of guilt.4 4 S.E., XIII, pp. 141-142.</page><page sequence="6">70 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN This construction has often been criticized. Anthropologists, like A.L. Kroeber,6 have insisted that these 'events' are completely unsubstantiated. There simply is no evidence of such a state of man and of such an occurrence. At most, its validity lies in its being a psychological parable of conflicts which are universal in nature. But Freud denied that his account was no more than fable. He insisted on the historicity of the primal crime. At the very end of Totem and Taboo, Freud wondered whether the primal crime was not an actual event but a fantasy, the guilt a consequence of a wish rather than a deed. But he did not permit himself this way out. Totem and Taboo closes with these lines: Primitive men ... are uninhibited; thought passes directly into action. With them it is rather the deed that is a substitute for the thought. And that is why, without laying claim to any finality of judgment, I think that in the case before us, it may be safely assumed that, 'In the beginning was the Deed.'6 Apart from the factual flimsiness of Freud's construction, there are also grounds for questioning Freud's version of the first principles of morality. Philip Rieff has suggested that there is something arbitrary about taking patricide to be the first crime, the first act about which men felt guilt.7 He has pointed out that frequently fratricide, as in Genesis and Hamlet, is presented as the archetypical crime and could as easily have served as the starting- point of moral inquiry. I would suggest an additional line of criticism. In Freud, the incest prohibition is directed against the child and has as its aim the control of the child's sexual desire for the parent of the opposite sex. Patricide, in wish or act, thus becomes the means of overthrowing this control. But even if we accept the centrality and universality of the incest prohibition, we may still wonder why it is perceived as an instrument to control the child. The child in his weakness is all too easily controlled. It may well be - at least it is as plausible as Freud's version - that the incest taboo came into being to protect the vulnerable child from the sexual advances of the 5 A.L.

Inc., New York, 1959, p. 214 ff.</page><page sequence="7">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 71 parent. If so, then this first principle of morality would involve an act of self-denial for the good of another (the child) and the good of society (the provision of a continuity of generations of providers for the new born). It is therefore possible to take the same starting-point as Freud, the proposition that the incest prohibition is the first moral rule, and come to drastically different conclusions about the implications of the 'creation' of morality. Freud himself found that there was an inherent difficulty in his depiction of the aftermath of the primal crime. He had discovered the origin of guilt in the brothers' remorse. But how had that guilt been handed down to successive generations? What is the common ground of that original guilt and the guilt which is now the inheritance of all mankind? Why should an event lost in the pre-history of man be effective in the present? Freud knew that he had to resolve these questions. I have supposed that the sense of guilt for an action has persisted for many thousands of years and has remained operative in generations which can have had no knowledge of that action.8 How is a sense of guilt transmitted? Until this moment in the unfolding of Freud's thought, the development of the sense of guilt had been a critical stage in the life history of every individual. The origin of guilt lay in a situation, the complex triangular relationships of father, mother, and child. Guilt was universal and inescapable because this situation was inevitable for every child born of woman and man. But now Freud had averred that guilt had a historical beginning. There was a time before guilt. Although Freud did not make it explicit, the conclusion is undeniable: the brothers who enacted the primal slaying and subsequently 'invented' guilt had grown to manhood without ever experiencing the sorrows of the Oedipus conflict. The patricides oddly enough provide us with a counter-example for the proposition that the Oedipus conflict is the universal outcome of a universal situation. Their example tantalizingly opens up the question of the possibility of an escape from this primary conflict. The primal crime had introduced a new and decisive element in human life. 8 S.E., xiii, p. 158.</page><page sequence="8">72 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN The earliest moral precepts and restrictions in primitive society have been explained by us as reactions to a deed which gave those who performed it the concept of a 'crime'. They felt remorse for the deed and decided that it should never be repeated and its performance should bring no advantages. This creative sense of guilt still persists among us.9 The historical events which Freud depicted in his account of the foundation of human society, thus, constitute not merely a new form of external relations among men but a revolution in the emotional life of the human being. In pre-literate societies, there are generally two modes of transmission of the cultural heritage: the institutions and rituals of the society and oral traditions. Freud made use of both of these modes. He characterized the totem meal as "mankind's earliest feast" which was a "repetition and commemoration" of that grizzly meal of the patricides who fed on their father's corpse.10 The ritual of the totem meal recapitulates and keeps alive the memory of the guilty deed. The myths and legends which Freud adduced throughout his work were similarly shown to have as their latent content, memories of the nucleus of the archetypical story. However, for reasons which will soon become clear, Freud did not content himself with these modes of transmission. Towards the end of Totem and Taboo, Freud pushed on to new ground. I have taken as the basis of my whole position the existence of a collective mind in which mental processes occur just as they do in the mind of an individual. ... 1 have supposed that an emotional process, such as might have developed in generations of sons who were ill-treated by their father, has extended to new generations which were exempt from such treatment for the very reason that their father had been eliminated. . . . Unless psychic processes were continued from one generation to another, if each generation were obliged to acquire its attitude to life anew, there would be no progress in this field and next to no development. ... A part of the problem seems to be met by the inheritance of psychic dispositions, which, however, need to be 9 Ibid., p. 159. 10 Ibid., p. 142.</page><page sequence="9">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 73 given some sort of impetus in the life of the individual before they can be roused into actual operation.11 This is the earliest reference to what Freud would come to call the "archaic heritage", the notion that Freud stubbornly maintained henceforth that there existed biologically inherited memories. James Strachey, the editor of the Standard Edition of Freud's work, has, in a note, provided a survey of the use of the idea in Freud's writings. He believes that the idea was developed during the 'Wolf-man' analysis which was conducted at the time of the writing of Totem and Taboo. Strachey produces extensive references to the term and the thought behind it which demonstrate that this was not an occasional idea of Freud but one to which he repeatedly returned.12 Ernest Jones, who was usually eager to defend any position taken by Freud, showed a certain amount of exasperation with the 'archaic heritage.' It is not easy to account for the fixity with which Freud held this opinion and the determination with which he ignored all the biological evidence to the contrary. Jones, however, regarded this whole line of thought as "incidental to his work" and, therefore, its presence did not compromise any major Freudian tenet.13 It is a common response to this peculiar Freudian doctrine to dismiss it as false but unimportant. Jerome Neu, in a careful study of Totem and Taboo, insisted that "the postulation of the inheritance of acquired characteristics seems not only implausible but unnecessarily cumbrous."14 Not that Freud's doctrine did not have its followers. Theodore Reik, who remained an orthodox Freudian, reasserted the 'archaic heritage' as late as 1954 in his Myth and Guilt.15 But Paul Roazen speaks for most of those who have studied Freud when he conveys a sense that it is almost unsporting to attack Freud on so weak a point. "One could, if one wanted to throw stones, have a field day with Freud's Lamarckianism."16 11 Ibid., pp. 157-158. 12 S.E., XXIII, p. 102n. 13 Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, Basic Books, Inc.

Philip Rieff, one of the most enlightening, penetrating and suggestive of all those who have written about Freud, has taken inherited memory more seriously than most commentators. He saw that it is the device by which Freud resolves the problem of the transmission of tradition. Rieff noted the appearance of similar ideas in other psychoanalytic theories and remarked that "the connection between psychoanalysis and Lamarckianism cannot be overemphasized."17 It may be noted how frequently the term 'Lamarckianism' appears in connection with the archaic heritage. It is a somewhat misleading term when used in this context. Freud was not talking about an acquired characteristic. The inherited memory of the primal crime is not simply the biological transmission of an acquired anatomical change or of a pattern of behavioral responses. Freud had asserted that a specific memory of an historical event had literally become part of the biological inheritance of mankind. In Moses and Monotheism, the work in which Freud gave his most complete account of the archaic heritage, he wrote, we become aware of the probability that what may be operative in an individual's psychical life may include not only what he has experienced himself but also things that were innately present in him at his birth, elements with a phylogenetic origin - an archaic heritage. . . . The archaic heritage of human beings comprises not only dispositions but also subject-matter - memory traces of the experience of earlier generations.18 At the end of the seventeenth century, John Locke, in his Essay on Human Understanding, painstakingly and permanently demolished the notion that there could be innate ideas. He argued that any such idea would be accessible to children and idiots and would, furthermore, enjoy the universal assent of mankind. He showed that no idea claimed to be innate could meet these criteria. Freud, of course, could have responded that the innate ideas about which he spoke were in the unconscious and were therefore not easily retrievable. Far from receiving assent, they would be resisted and guarded against, just as any other unconscious material would be. But 17 Rieff, op. cit., p. 219. 18 S.E., XXIII, p. 99.</page><page sequence="11">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 75 there is another line of Locke's argument which can not be so readily turned aside. Locke pointed out that the ideas and propositions which were alleged to be innate contained highly sophisticated moral, theological, or scientific concepts which were beyond the reach of children and could not be known from birth. In Freud's case, the 'memory' of the primal crime included the elements 'father', 'murder' and 'responsibility'. Fatherhood as either a biological or social relationship is not a simple and evident matter of fact. To assert that a child is born with the memory of a patricide is to claim that the child is born with the concept of a father, i.e., with knowledge of the relationship between sexuality and reproduction. 'Murder' and 'responsibility' are, if anything, even more complex terms. It is little wonder that until Freud, no serious thinker after Locke attempted to revive this discredited doctrine. Kant had, to be sure, qualified Locke's position but Kantian philosophy does not represent a return to a belief in innate ideas. What Kant argued was that the mind has a set structure which alone permits it to receive and organize data from the external world. Kant insisted that the content of knowledge is never innate and must be derived from experience. As has been seen, Freud's archaic heritage is not limited to the forms of knowledge but includes specific memories. Freud knew that he did not have persuasive evidence and that the whole weight of biological science was against him. Yet he confessed, in words which ought to disturb all those who believe that the archaic heritage can be casually disregarded, "I cannot do without this factor in biological evolution."19 The lengths to which Freud would carry this notion can be seen in Moses and Monotheism, in which Freud produced a remarkable variant of the archaic heritage. In his famous revision of Jewish history, Freud related that the Jews had killed Moses and that the murder had been seared into their conscience with the same force as in the primal slaying. The slaying of Moses became a specific inherited memory of the Jews. The basis of national character, Freud suggested, was a shared inherited memory. When I spoke of the survival of a tradition among a people, of the formation of a people's character, I had mostly in mind an inherited tradition of this kind and not one transmitted by communication.20 19 Ibid. p. 100. 20 Idem</page><page sequence="12">76 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN In the presence of Statements such as this, one can appreciate the delicacy of those who would politely decline to consider this whole line of thought. There is a relevant passage in The Human Condition in which Hannah Arendt examines some gross inconsistencies in Karl Marx's use of the term 'labor', a concept which is basic to his philosophy. Rather than congratulate herself on her critical skill, she comments, "Such fundamental and flagrant contradictions rarely occur in second-rate thinkers; in the work of great authors they lead into the very center of their work."21 There is more than a clever paradox in this observation. The tenacity with which Freud held on to his preposterous account of the transmission of guilt should alert us that we are at a sensitive and focal point of his thought. If he felt so strongly that he could not "do without this factor," it behooves us to ask why not. The archaic heritage was meant to resolve questions pertaining to the relationship of the individual and society. The final explanation of its presence in Freud's thought must await an examination of how Freud came to understand that relationship. To do so will require an excursion into the intellectual history of Totem and Taboo. Freud's current position as a figure familiar to all educated people should not cause us to forget that there was a time when his audience consisted principally of a relatively small group of practicing analysts and physicians working in related areas. He worked within the traditions of discourse of the natural scientist. He published in scientific journals, attended professional conferences, ran a weekly seminar, discussed current issues with other practitioners and, because travel time was limited, he relied on extensive corres- pondence with colleagues. In 1974, for the first time, the correspondence between Freud and Jung was published. In time, it will undoubtedly have the same impact on understanding the developments of Freud's thought that the publication of the Fliess correspondence had a quarter of a century earlier. The works of Freud speak for themselves. But the issues which are clarified by the correspondence with Jung go well beyond the question of the genesis of Freud's ideas; they take us to the center of the great twentieth century problem of the relationship of culture and personality. 21 Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1958, pp. 104-105.</page><page sequence="13">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 11 It is clear from the Jung correspondence that Freud was, to some extent, prodded into historical and anthropological speculations by the increasingly independent position which Jung was developing. In the preface to the first edition of Totem and Taboo, Freud acknowledged that the essays included in the volume offer a methodological contrast on the one hand to Wilhelm Wundt's extensive work. . . . and on the other hand to the writings of the Zurich school of psychoanalysis, which endeavour, on the contrary, to solve the problems of individual psychology with the help of material derived from social psychology (Cf. Jung, 1912 and 1913). I readily confess that it was from these two sources that I received the first stimulus for my own essays.22 The last line of the acknowledgment both conceals and reveals the bitterness which Freud felt after several years of wrangling with the "Zurich school", that is to say, with Carl Gustav Jung. As early as 1908, that fine analyst and devoted Freudian, Karl Abraham, was expressing doubts about Jung's reliability. "Jung seems to be reverting to his former spiritualistic inclinations."23 Abraham, who had trained in Zurich with Jung was, like Freud himself, strongly committed to the rational tradition of science. Jung's growing interest in the occult seemed hard to reconcile with that tradition and, moreover, could threaten the standing of psycho- analysis in the scientific community which Freud had tried so hard to win over and which, Freud felt, often associated psychoanalysis with disreputable doctrines. Nevertheless, Freud made every effort to calm Abraham in order to prevent a break with Jung who was one of the only Gentiles in the psychoanalytic movement. "Our Aryan comrades are really completely indispensable to us, otherwise psychoanalysis would succumb to anti-Semitism."24 This motive helps to explain the unusual efforts which Freud made over the next four years to avoid a final break with Jung. In Ernest Jones' depiction of the background of the writing of Totem and Taboo, he explains that Jung had been working on 22 S.E. XIII, p. ix. 23 H. C. Abraham and Ernst Freud, eds., A Psychoanalytic Dialogue: ¡he Letters oj Sigmund Freud and Karl Abraham, 1907-1926, Basic Books, Inc., New York, 1965, p. 44. 24 Ibid. p. 64.</page><page sequence="14">78 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN mythology and religion and that Freud was dissatisfied with Jung's approach. Jung was deriving rather uncertain conclusions from that far off field and transferring them to the explanation of clinical data, while Freud's method was to see how far the assured con- clusions derived from his direct analytical experience could throw light on the more distant problems of man's early history. It was doubtless these considerations that spurred him to see what contributions he could himself make.25 Jones' explanation is consistent with the generally held belief that Freud's forays into anthropology and social theory were experiments in "applied psychoanalysis" which could in no way compromise the doctrine of psychoanalysis itself. There are, however, some serious difficulties with this version of the events leading to the publication of Totem and Taboo. Freud usually encouraged his adherents when they attempted to engage in what Jones calls "non-medical applications of psychoanalysis." In a letter to Jung, Freud wrote, "I long for mythologists, linguists, and historians of religion; if they won't come to our help, we shall have to do all that ourselves."26 In the particular case of Jung's work on mythology and religion, Freud was far from disapproving. When Freud's essay, "The Horror of Incest", was first published, it included a paragraph which was deleted when the essay was republished in book form as part of Totem and Taboo. For all those who have taken part in the development of psychoanalytic research it was a memorable moment when at a private scientific gathering one of C. G. Jung's students read a communication in his behalf to the effect that the fantasy images of certain mental patients (Dementia praecox) presented the most striking parallels to the mythological cosmogonies of ancient peoples, concerning which the uneducated among the patients cannot possibly have had scientific knowledge. ... In subsequent writings, Jung himself . . . [has] further developed the ideas then touched upon. (Cf. Jung, "Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido")27 25 Jones, op. cit., Vol 11, p. 351. 26 William McGuire, ed., The Freud-Jung Letters, Princeton University Press, Princeton 1974, p. 236. 27 Ibid, p. 485n.</page><page sequence="15">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 79 Furthermore, Freud's quarrel with Jung was not about matters remote from the core of psychoanalysis. Their dispute concerned essential tenets of psychoanalytic theory: the concept of libido and the Oedipus conflict. In the acknowledgment in the preface to Totem and Taboo, Freud referred to two works of Jung: The Symbols of Transformation (1912) and The Theory of Psychoanalysis (1913). The latter work, however, did not deal with 'non-medical applications' and it opened the irreconcilable breach between Jung and Freud. The work criticized and revised Freud's concept of libido which Jung desexualized and redefined as a general plastic energy which can attach itself and withdraw from a variety of possible objects. I think there is nothing for it but to abandon the sexual definition of libido, or we shall lose what is valuable in the libido theory, namely the energie point of view [i.e., that libido is plastic and can cathect upon or withdraw cathexis from a wide range of objects.]28 Having abandoned the psychosexual basis of personality conflicts, Jung proceeded to reject the whole principle of depth psychology, that the origin of neurosis lay in the earliest childhood conflicts over sexuality. The more deeply we penetrate into the heart of the infantile development, the more we get the impression that as little of aetiological significance can be found there as in the infantile trauma. . . In constructing a theory which derives the neuroses from causes in the distant past, we are first and foremost following the tendency of our patients to live as far away as possible from the critical present. For the cause of the pathogenic conflict lies mainly in the present moment. ... It is mainly in the present that the effective causes lie, and here alone are the possibilities of removing them.29 It is in this line of thought that Freud most probably found the 'stimulus' for his excursions into pre-history. 28 C.W. - The Collected Works of Carl Gustav Jung, edited by Read, Fornam, Adler, Pantheon Books, New York 1953 - . C.W., Vol. 4, p. 118. 29 Ibid., p. 166.</page><page sequence="16">80 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN The issues of myth and religion, of culture in general, became the issues over which the two debated their fundamental dispute con- cerning the nature of the neuroses. Jung had made it clear in a letter to Freud that he considered the problem of the neuroses to rest on the resolution of the cultural questions upon which he was working. We shall not solve the ultimate secrets of neurosis and psychosis without mythology and the history of civilization, for embryology goes hand in hand with comparative anatomy and without the latter the former is but a freak of nature whose depths remain uncompre hended.30 Freud, of course, believed that he had already discovered the 'secrets' of neurosis without recourse to the history of civilization. But he was genuinely interested in the problems which Jung had raised. He was delighted with the possibilities of a parallel between history and the development of the individual. As he himself was drawn into working on pre-history, he evidently expected that such research would confirm his general theory that sexuality and the Oedipus complex lay at the root of all things. For Freud, and for many others who followed, psychoanalytic theory could provide an exhaustive and complete account of the human being. Psychoanalysis was not one among the sciences of man. It surpassed and superceded them all. The implication of psychoanalysis all along had been that culture was a product of personality. And the debate with Jung turned on this claim. Jung found in mythological materials evidence that he was right in his belief that Freudian principles provided only a partial explanation of behavioral and psychological conflicts. As their quarrel grew and they came to find their points of disagreement more significant than their points of agreement, they tended to join the issue over broader cultural questions rather than those which had a distinct clinical focus. Their shared starting-point was that both culture and the individual could be explained by a single set of principles which were fundamental to each. Before their dispute came to a head, Freud wrote to Jung, "I hope you will soon come to agree with me that in all likelihood mythology centers on the same nuclear concept as the neurosis."31 Freud did not 30 Freud- Jung Letters, p. 269. 31 Ibid., p. 260.</page><page sequence="17">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 81 have to wait long for Jung's concurrence. Four days later, Jung replied to Freud, "For me there is no longer any doubt what the oldest and most natural myths are trying to say. They speak naturally of the nuclear complex of neurosis."32 Both men, therefore, were convinced that there was a deep relationship between the primary content of myth and the basis of personality. For both, the connection between the two phenomena was much more than a mere analogy. They believed that the very same material was involved in myth and the formation of neuroses and that material lay at the heart of the fundamental constitution of the human being. But on the precise nature of myth and neurosis and the relationship between the two, Freud and Jung differed and their differences were so great and so deep that, much as they wished to remain in alliance, no house, however large, could hold them both. Previously, in his 1907 paper, "Obsessive Acts and Religious Practices", Freud had explored the possibility of comparing a social institution (religion) and the psychological processes of individuals (obsessives). The linkage between the social and the individual was not as tight as Freud would later make it. He investigated the "resemblances" between the two as he attempted to lay out their similarities and differences. His main thesis was that both the obsessive patient and the religious observant employed rituals which functioned as a defense against prohibited instinctual desires. This imaginative coupling of two apparently disparate phenomena was this paper's major contribution. Freud had again shown that his dis- coveries had reopened all questions pertaining to the phenomenon of man. At the end of the paper, he tentatively suggested a closer connection between religion and obsession, In view of these resemblances and analogies one might venture to regard the obsessional neurosis as a pathological counterpart to the formation of a religion, to describe the neurosis as a private religious system, and religion as a universal obsessional neurosis.33 Up to this point, Freud had done no more than to apply psychoanalytic concepts to a 'non-medical', that is, cultural, phenomenon. He had not 32 Ibid. p. 263. 33 S.E., IX, p. 126.</page><page sequence="18">82 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN yet made the important step of asserting that traits of both culture and personality were produced by the same processes and were discoverable by psychoanalytic investigation. The next step was made not by Freud but by Karl Abraham who, in 1909, published, "Dream and Myths: A Study in Folk Psychology." Abraham maintained that the symbols of myths were similar to the symbols of dreams and that the former could be interpreted by the same methods which Freud had applied to dreams. Myths had a latent as well as a manifest content and the latent content originated in "the sexual phantasies of mankind."34 Myths, like dreams, represented the fulfillment of unconscious wishes. Abraham further asserted that the theory of wish fulfillment could also be applied to religion. Then, the usually cautious Abraham permitted himself to indulge in some high speculation. He turned to the embryological discovery that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, that the developing embryo passes through the various stages of evolution. He asserted that in the same way the psychological development of the individual recapitulated the stages of human history. The earliest period of human history corresponded to the early stages of childhood. "The myth is a surviving fragment of the psychic life of the infancy of the race whilst the dream is the myth of the individual."35 The idea of a childhood of the species was an old one, but now two advances had given it new meanings. One was anthropology's investigation of primitive cultures which provided living examples of what civilized man's pre-history may have been. The other was Freud's own work which refashioned our understanding of child- hood. To the comparison of children and primitives, Freud added a third element, neurotics. The resemblances of children, primitives and neurotics were the focal point of Freud's investigations in Totem and Taboo. It is characteristic of mechanistic thinkers to feel that a phenomenon is not properly understood until they have constructed it themselves or understood how it is constructed. Karl Abraham, as has been seen, did more than claim that myths could be interpreted by the same methods as dreams. He had attempted to demonstrate that myths were constructed in the same manner as dreams. Freud was now to 34 Karl Abraham, Clinical Papers and Essays on Psycho- Analysis, The Hogarth Press, London 1955, p. 205. 35 Ibid. pp. 207-208.</page><page sequence="19">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 83 add the principle that the myths, rituals and beliefs of primitives were produced by the same mechanisms that produced neurotic symptoms. Accordingly, in the second of the Totem and Taboo essays, Freud used the process of projection to explain certain primitive beliefs. By means of projection, an emotion which a person feels and represses is projected outward onto a person or object in the world. Projection is a mechanism of defense; the emotion is warded off by being dissociated from the ego. Freud offered as an example that demonization of dead loved ones resulted from a projection of the hostility towards them which one felt but could not admit. The mechanism of projection provided Freud with one example of the mechanism of myth-formation and a means by which he could trace myths back to purely internal psychic processes. Similarly, Freud in the third essay, "Animism, Magic and the Omnipotence of Thoughts", sought in the doctrine of animism confirmation that primitive beliefs could ultimately be explained psychoanalytically. Animism was the concept developed by E.B. Tylor who concluded that the origin of religion lay in the primitive belief that all objects in the world were alive and conscious, that there were spirits everywhere. Tylor stated that the belief in spirits was suggested to early man by the experience of seeing himself and others in dreams. Primitive man attempted to master and control the world through propitiation of the spirits which dominated nature. Freud perceived a similarity between animism and the psychological failure, exaggerated in children and neurotics, to recognize the reality and independence of the external world. Such a failure led to the belief that the world can be controlled by thought and will in the same way that the body responds to the mind. The direction of Freud's thought could not be clearer. He turned to the earliest strata of human social life and discovered that the rules, institutions and systems of belief of primitive man were not only susceptible to psychoanalytic explanation but were produced by the same mechanisms which psychoanalysis had elucidated. The earliest forms of social life were disclosed to be the externalization of psychic conflicts of those who had no firm grasp of the distinction between the inner world of the psyche and the external world of nature. Myths and rituals were representations of the inner life of human beings projected outwards where they reappeared as cosmic conflicts. "We are thus prepared to find that primitive man transposed the structural conditions of his own mind into the external</page><page sequence="20">84 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN world."36 If myths recapitulate psychic processes, then, the investigation of myth can never lead to conclusions which contradict the principles of psychoanalytic theory. The position that underlies all of Freud's analyses of primitive social institutions is that they arise as projections of internal processes of the personality. Culture is not for Freud a sphere of human existence which is independent of the same psychodynamics which produce neurosis in the individual. Jung bitterly rejected this effort to consider cultural forms as purely psychogenic. Jung's grounds were, to be sure, not entirely those of the Rousseauian tradition which sought in social institutions the basis of human character. Jung was not merely conventionally religious. He was indeed what Freud and Abraham feared he was: a mystic and practitioner of the occult who often conversed with the apparitions which appeared to him. In Symbols of Transformation Jung remarked: "For enlightened people, the need for religion is next door to neurosis." And then he added in a footnote the comment, "Unfortunately Freud, too, has made himself guilty of this error."37 The scornful use of the term "enlightened people" immediately removes us from the spiritual world of Freud for whom "enlightened" could never be anything but a term of high praise. For Jung, myths were not neurotic or childish distortions of reality. Myths were archetypical expressions of recurring events and relationships in nature. The cycles of birth and death, youth and age, the ebb and flow of sexuality, the hero and the sacrifice, the duality of male and female were for Jung the enduring and imperishable substrata of the world to which man belonged. Myth was not for Jung as it was for Freud a stage of mental development to be superceded by science. Myth, Jung believed, was a truer and more adequate expression of certain primeval truths than was modern science. "Symbols are not allegories and not signs; they are images of contents which for the most part transcend consciousness."38 According to Jung, the scientific enterprise yielded one kind of knowledge but only at the expense of the loss of a rich source of knowledge. But, Jung went on to say, the knowledge which takes the form of myth can never be permanently lost since it is permanently lodged in 36 S.E., XIII, p. 91. 37 C.W., Vol. 5, p. 71. 38 Ibid. p. 77.</page><page sequence="21">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 85 the unconscious as a phylogenetic heritage. Each human being has, in addition to a personal unconscious, a collective unconscious which bears the "deposits of constantly repeated experiences of humanity."39 The dominance of scientific rationalism had as its consequence not only man's loss of significant knowledge of the world but also the loss of a part of himself. Science alienated man from his own unconscious as a repository of age-old wisdom. Later, Jung was to claim that this alienation was a cause of neurosis.40 Jung therefore denied that myth had its origin in the human psyche. On the contrary, myth, he explained, was the product of man's experience of the world. The patterns of nature imprinted themselves on human consciousness and were, eventually, stored permanently in the repository of the collective unconscious. Jung's account of the origin of myth was the reverse of Freud's. Myth was not the projection of psychic processes out onto the world. Myth was the result of an introjection of the real character of the world.41 For Freud, the unconscious, ruled as it was by the pleasure principle, could never give an account of reality. It was precisely the nature of the unconscious to deny reality. The unconscious refused to recognize even the law of contradiction. It was heedless of the most basic properties of time and space. It recognized no physical restrictions over its empire of desire. It was the conscious ego alone which recognized the dominion of the reality principle. The ego was built up at the point of contact between the organism and the external world. It should be remembered that Freud always associated neurosis with a flight from reality. The ego stood for health and for the reality principle, that is, for the rational recognition of the autonomy and intractability of the external world. Freud's deep commitment to science was woven into his psychoanalytic theory. Science is the very model of the work of the ego. In Totem and Taboo, Freud adopted a variant of Auguste Comte's stages of growth of human rationality. 39 C.W., Vol. 7, p. 69. 40 "In reality we can never legitimately cut loose from our archetypal foundations unless we are prepared to pay the price of neurosis."

To look at Jung's work through Freud's eyes is to see it as an elevation of neurosis into a human ideal. If Freud was too one-sided in his conviction that psychoanalysis was competent to explain the whole range of cultural phenomena, he was on firm ground in his opposition to those, beginning with Jung, who saw in psychoanalysis a means of gaining respectability for new irrationalist philosophies. To be sure, the specific content of Jung's theory was worked out and elaborated only in the voluminous writing he produced in the half-century following his final break with Freud. It is also true that right up to the termination of their association, both men tried to find a common ground and to minimize their difference. Jung's bitter sense of having been under restraints in 1912 broke through decades later in the preface he wrote to an extensively revised edition of Symbols of Transformation which was published in 1952. I have never felt happy about this book ... it was the explosion of all those psychic contents which could find no room, no breathing space, in the constricting atmosphere of Freudian psychology and its narrow outlook.43 Yet, for all their restraint and search for a compromise, in 1912, both Freud and Jung knew what they were doing. Their split was over neither personal nor trivial matters. Late in 1912, Freud wrote to Jung, "You seem to have solved the riddle of all mysticism, showing it to be based on the symbolic utilization of complexes that have outlived their function."44 It was a clumsy attempt to interpret Jung back into the fold, to characterize Jung's work as an analysis of mysticism, rather than a participation in it. Jung exploded, 42 S.E. XIII, p. 77*. 43 C.W. Vol. 5, p. xxiii. 44 Freud- Jung Letters, p. 524.</page><page sequence="23">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 87 My dear Professor, forgive me again but this sentence shows me that you deprive yourself of understanding my work by your underestimation of it. You speak of this insight as though it were some kind of pinnacle, whereas actually it is at the very bottom of the mountain. This insight has been self-evident to us for years. Again, please excuse my frankness. It is only occasionally that I am afflicted with the purely human desire to be understood intellectually and not to be measured by the yardstick of neurosis.45 Earlier in that year, Freud had compared Jung's analysis of incest to Adler's. It was rather like the Pope commenting to a Cardinal that his sermon was reminiscent of Martin Luther. Jung called the comparison "a bitter pill."46 What was this all about? Freud was intent upon preserving the core of psychoanalytic doctrine. Other issues were not vital to him. He maintained a warm and cordial relationship with the Swiss pastor and analyst, Oskar Pfister, throughout the time of his dispute with Jung and for many years afterwards. His close friend and follower, Sandor Ferenczi, had entertained ideas about the occult without it disturbing their friendly relationship. What Jung had done was to have rejected Freud's theory of libido and to have removed the incest problem from its central place in the aetiology of the neuroses. It was over psychoanalysis that they had quarreled. But what was the precise connection between these major revisions of psychoanalytic theory and the issues raised in Totem and Taboo? The connection is suggested succinctly in the preface to Totem and Taboo to which we must again refer. The work offers [s] a methodological contrast ... to the writings of the Zurich school of psycho-analysis, which endeavour ... to solve the problems of individual psychology with the help of material derived from social psychology.47 But Freud believed that he had solved the "problems of individual psychology" without the assistance of social psychology. Although Freud depicted the individual as being always in radical conflict with 45 Ibid., p. 526. 46 Ibid., p. 509. 47 S.E. XII, p. ix.</page><page sequence="24">88 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN society, this conflict raged within the individual and could be exhaustively understood as an internal conflict of opposing psychic trends. Indeed, it was Freud's goal to explain social phenomena in terms of individual psychology. "The social instincts were themselves derived from a combination of egoistic and erotic components into wholes of a special kind."48 That is to say, the internalized representatives of society which contended against the individual's desire for gratification were themselves modifications of highly 'individualistic' instincts. Therefore, knowledge of social institutions was not, for Freud, a pre-condition for understanding the individual. In Totem and Taboo, he attempted to demonstrate that the roots of social life lay in the nexus of issues which he had elucidated by means of psychoanalysis. Not even the Oedipus complex was an exception to the rule that all major determining events in the psychic life of man originated within the individual. That complex, if we follow Freud, did not originate in an external or social prohibition against incest. The incestuous desire is a natural result of the child's affection for his nurturing mother. The Oedipus complex emerges from the complicated and ambivalent feelings the child has about the father who is hated and feared as a rival and loved as a guide and protector. The Oedipus complex, with its products, conscience and guilt, is derived from a conflict of emotions, not from a conflict between an emotion and a prohibition. The drama of the Oedipus complex, which each person recapitulates in his passage from infancy to adulthood, is played out intra- psychically and is prior to and independent of the proscriptions and institutions of the social world.49 In Totem and Taboo, Freud investigated the origin of such prohibitions and rules. The totemic system and the dreaded taboos constituted, for Freud, the first and original set of restrictions which man imposed on his instinctual life. Freud claimed that totemism was a derivative of the Oedipus complex: it prohibited endogamous marriages and the slaying of the totem animal, the father- substitute.50 For his explanation of taboo, Freud returned to his 48 Ibid. p. 73. 49 Freud, in one his most thorough accounts of the Oedipus complex, referred to its "spontaneous nature", that is, it was not a result of an event. S. E. XVI, p. 333. 50 "It is probable that the totemic system . . . was a product of the conditions involved in the Oedipus complex." S.E. XIII, p. 132.</page><page sequence="25">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 89 analysis of "Obsessive Acts and Religious Practices". Taboos resembled obsessional neurosis in that they contained intense pro- hibitions against acts that were strongly desired. The taboo was produced by emotional ambivalence; "the basis of a taboo is a prohibited action, for performing which a strong inclination exists in the unconscious."51 Taboo, as has been seen, is the earliest manifestation of conscience. Conscience born of ambivalence is the formula of the resolution of the Oedipus complex. Freud had prepared the way for his stunning conclusion. "The beginnings of religion, morals, society and art converge in the Oedipus complex."52 The entire range of the social life of man was perceived by Freud to be an epiphenomenon of intra-psychic conflicts. Freud was indeed, as has always been suspected, a psychological reductionist. His reduction of the social to the individual was aimed at closing down any line of thought that would conclude that it was possible to modify radically or annul the 'nuclear complex of neurosis' by a transformation of cultural and social institutions. Freud had, in a manner of speaking, faced in 1912 the issues which were to be raised much later by the neo-Freudians and the Freudian Marxists. He rejected the possibility of what today is called a "non-repressive society' not simply because he thought such a society to be impossible to realize but because he believed that such a social philosophy rested on premises which contradicted the basic principles of psychoanalysis. The Rousseauian principle that Freud opposed holds that human character is determined not merely by the general fact that human beings live in societies but, more particularly, by the specific social institutions in which a particular group of people lives. The implication of the principle is that character can be changed by a transformation of the institutions. This implication has stood as a basic credo of all modern leftist thought. The individual as Freudian psychoanalytic theory presented him is not amenable to relief through social change. Freudian thought provides a useful corrective to the claims that social reformers have made about the possibilities of terminating human suffering. Psychoanalysis returns us to the abiding realities of the vicissitudes of the body, the calamities of nature, and the abrasions, conflicts and tragedies inherent in a person's relations with other human beings. But the psychoanalytic perspective does not do justice to one major domain of human reality, 51 Ibid. p. 32. 52 Ibid. p. 156.</page><page sequence="26">90 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN the objective order of the institutions of society. The psychoanalytic approach ignored the power of institutions, whatever their origin, to exist according to their own logic and shape and form not merely the thought and behavior of people but the direction and course of their emotional lives. The debate over the social implications of psychoanalytic theory is clouded by two later accretions of Freud's thought. After he had introduced the instinct of aggression, he added to the functions of society the task of controlling instinctual aggression. Furthermore, he held that a function of society was to master and control nature through human co-operation. Both these functions could be and were utilized by politically minded Freudians who attacked the proposition that aggression was instinctual and who emphasized the element of human co-operation in order to demonstrate that it was possible for society to reduce significantly the level of control which it exercised over individuals. But such a 'revision' would leave untouched the position which Freud established in Totem and Taboo and never abandoned, i.e., that the earliest social rules were externalizations of intra-psychic conflicts and they are, like the rituals of obsessives, irrational means to irrational ends. It is only at this, the core of his thought, that Freud can be properly and adequately met. There are, I believe, two major weaknesses in Freud's account of myth. He failed to see significant features of the intellectual function of myth and the practical function of myth. Freud could not appreciate the ways in which myth served an intellectual function insofar as for him myth was no more than a projection of purely subjective processes. As he put it, Animism is a system of thought . . . which is most consistent and exhaustive and which gives a truly complete explanation of the nature of the universe. This first human Weltanschauung is a psychological theory.53 Freud obviously could not see the inconsistency in his formulation. To the extent that myth explains the universe and does so consistently, it must pay some attention to external phenomena and cannot be completely psychological, that is, mere projection. Freud did not grasp that quality in myth which Ernst Cassirer was soon to 53 Ibid. p. 77.</page><page sequence="27">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 91 emphasize, that myth is a form of thought.54 Myths, Cassirer insisted, organize experience. They provide a system of classification, a structure of relationships of particular phenomena and events, a schema in which experiences are located in time and space and wherein they may be understood as part of a sequence or process. In a word, myths serve an intellectual purpose. Levi-Strauss, in particular, has stressed the point that the knowledge of primitives is not based on purely practical needs. Primitives, for instance, make botanical classifications which include the differentiae of plants for which they have no use.65 One would be hard put to corroborate Freud's belief that all curiosity, even those of primitives from whom sexuality is not hidden, has its origin in the child's sexual curiosity. There are in the world other stimuli to curiosity. Moreover, although it is true that it is a characterisitic of mythical consciousness that the human and the natural are not distinguished from one another, Freud's psychological anthropomorphism is a bit one-sided. It is not sufficient to say that primitives explain nature in human terms. To be precise, one must say that for the primitive there is a single order of phenomena which behave according to a single set of principles. It is as true to say that primitives use nature to explain human behavior as it is to say the reverse. Myths, to be sure, are not real in the sense that Jung, who was a believer in the occult and a mystic, meant it. But neither are they as fantastic, as much a product of fantasy, as Freud thought them to be. Myths, like philosophy in Plato's account, were born of wonder.56 It is not difficult to understand why Freud's portrayal of the intellectual functions of myth is so limited. He had become trapped by his own system. He sought to prove that the same psychic processes underlay the mental lives of children, neurotics and primitives. His theory of the primitive mind was derived from his understanding of children and neurotics. What Freud considered to be the essential characteristic common to all neurotics can be expressed tersely in the 54 Ernst Cassirer, The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Volume Two: Mythical Thinking, Yale University Press, New Haven 1955. 55 Claude Levi-Strauss, The Savage Mind, University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1966. 56 "For the life of man and the function of the state are for the mythopoeic thought imbedded in nature, and the natural processes are affected by the acts of man no less than man's life depends on his harmonious integration with nature." Frankfort, et. al., Before Philosophy, Penguin Books, Baltimore 1971, p. 36.</page><page sequence="28">92 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN maxim that all neurotics are engaged in a flight from reality.57 Similarly, the child's sense of reality depends upon the development of the ego which is the agency of learning about and understanding the external world. The child, like the neurotic, has a mental life dominated by fantasy. It is no wonder then that Freud, when he applied psychoanalytic principles to myth, failed to perceive the way in which myth functions intellectually to make intelligible an order of the world whose principles are not altogether drawn from the human psyche but are inductive discoveries of some of the objective regularities of the world. Notwithstanding his lifelong passion for science, Freud remained convinced that this high activity of the ego was accessible to only the very few. Knowing was not, Freud thought, important for the great majority of mankind. Freud was, of course, opposing the over- estimation of reason in human affairs that was so characteristic of much of nineteenth century social science and ethics. Although he himself was a dedicated scientist and knew more than most the excitement of sheer knowing, reason seemed to him predominantly an instrument of control, particularly of the emotions. Because Freud saw the strength of the emotions in human life, reason as a control of the emotions would have to seem weak and often absent as a major force in the lives of most people. There was, however, another account of reason in the Western tradition upon which Freud could have drawn but did not. At the beginning of the Western philosophical tradition Aristotle had posited a human desire to know. "All men," we are told in the opening line of Aristotle's Metaphysics, "by nature desire to know." The Greek word which is rendered by the English "desire" is a strong word, "orexirì' which has the sense of an instinctual drive. Knowing, Aristotle goes on to argue, is a form of pleasure. We know how to use our knowledge to bring delight. The pleasure we take in our senses comes in part from the knowledge they bring us. Such a notion of reason is consistent with Levi-Strauss's primitive botanists. Freud had missed an opportunity. He could have deepened his theory of man and history had he seen that knowing, too, is imbued with eros. As it stands, his theory of the human personality suffers from its inability to give its due to the 57 "We have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality." S.E. XII, p. 218.</page><page sequence="29">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 93 distinctive property of the human being to be, among other things, an animal that knows. If one turns from the intellectual to the practical functions of myth, one finds in Freud the same constricted view of myth. Totems and taboos are derivatives of the Oedipus complex and serve as defenses against incest. Magic, the effort by man to bind and control nature, is also explained in terms of the individual psyche. Magic reflects a mental process common to children and neurotics, an over- estimation of the mind's power to control the world. Magic is an example of what Freud calls the belief in the "omnipotence of thoughts." Magic, too, is a failure to recognize the nature of reality. As Freud was composing the last of the Totem and Taboo essays, a seminal work appeared by the great French sociologist, Emile Durkheim, whose The Elementary Forms of Religious Life was published in 1912. (Its subtitle is The Totemic System in Australia) Freud made a casual reference to the work in the final Totem and Taboo essay but it was only to dismiss Durkheim's theory. For Durkheim, as for Freud, modern social institutions had their origin in religious practices and beliefs. But whereas Freud traced religion back to human psychology, Durkheim argued that religion had its roots in the social character of human life and that it was with society and not with the individual that one must start for an account of the foundations of the human condition. Durkheim elaborated a penetrating attack on the theory of animism upon which Freud had relied so heavily. The beliefs which people hold about the world determine how they will act in the world. A system of belief built upon mere fantasy and illusion, projections in Freud's terminology, would leave a people ill-equipped to handle the problems of survival. If a belief is perpetuated, its continued existence is a proof that it contains some truth about the real world and contributes to the believer's survival in the world. "An error and especially a system of errors which leads to, and can lead to, nothing but mistaken and useless practices has no chance of living."58 There is, then, in all religions an element of substantial truth about the nature of the world. He who would understand the origins of what it means to be specifically human must investigate what it is about the 58 Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, The Free Press, New York 1965, p. 87.</page><page sequence="30">94 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN world that is expressed in religion and why this expression takes the form of religion.59 Religion, Durkheim concluded, represents the "collective reality" of human society. The external world, the objective order of the universe, is never for man nature in all its immediacy. Man is born into an organized society; the place he finds in the world is a place in that society. It existed before him and will no doubt survive his death. The language he uses to think and speak about the world and the categories which explain the world are given to him by society. Religion is not merely a stabilizing and unifying force within society, it is an expression of the awe men feel towards the social foundations of their lives as human beings. Religion is built up out of awe. Religion's achievement is to introduce a new category into human affairs, the sacred, from which is distinguished all that is profane.60 Religion, then, is a consequence of two universal truths about the human condition. The first is that man is everywhere a social being. This does not mean that man is instinctively social; it is rather that the condition of being human pre- supposes the condition of being social. In Aristotle's dictum, it is only a beast or a god who can realize his potential outside of a polis. The second truth is that the social life of man is never confined to a purely practical arrangement for meeting day-to-day needs. Without undervaluing the "material foundation" of society, Durkheim insisted that society was also a "moral community", a shared consciousness about the world and the high drama of human life. Durkheim's analysis echoes Edmund Burke's famous sentiment, The state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico, or tobacco, or some such other low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with other reverence, because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal 59 "How could a vain fantasy have been able to fashion the human consciousness so strongly and so durably? Surely it ought to be a principle of the science of religions that religion expresses nothing which does not exist in nature. . . . The only question is to learn from what part of nature these realities come and what has been able to make men represent them under this singular form which is peculiar to religious thought.11 Ibid., p. 87. 60 Ibid. p. 56.</page><page sequence="31">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 95 existence of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a partnership in all science, a partnership in all art, a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection.61 Religion, then, for Durkheim is a "collective representation" of those features of social life which go beyond the material foundations of society. There is no need to follow Durkheim's discussion further. The issue with Freud is sharply drawn. Durkheim's positing of the social foundations of human life throws into doubt the very question of whether human society can be said to have an origin. It would appear to be a contradiction in terms. Wherever there are humans, there is society. Neither entity predates the other. Both the human and the social emerge together out of the wastes of time. The issue which Durkheim's work raises is whether psychoanalysis, as Freud claimed,62 can by itself produce an exhaustive and valid account of social life. The conflict between Freud and Durkheim is neither an historically dated debate between two intellectuals of the past nor a purely academic squabble between the priorities and methodologies of psychoanalysis and sociology. What Freud sought was not an application but a vindication of psychoanalysis. If the original forms and institutions of society could be resolved into the inner trends and conflicts which psychoanalysis had explicated, then, he was persuaded, no revelation of social psychology could controvert the truths which individual psychology had demonstrated. The question is what is decisive and ultimate in human existence. Freud believed that no historical event, no modification of social institutions could transform the fundamental nature of the human being as a creature rent with ineradicable inner conflicts arising from the Oedipal dilemma. In taking this position that history and society are epiphenomena of an immutable psychological reality, Freud placed himself in an intellectual tradition that stretches from Schopenhauer to contemporary psycho- 61 Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France, The Liberal Arts Press, New York 1955, p. 110. 62 The claim is most explicitly made in the New Introductory Lectures in which Freud remarked, "For sociology too, dealing as it does with the behaviour of people in society, cannot be anything but applied psychology. Strictly speaking, there are only two sciences: psychology, pure and applied, and natural science." S.E. XXII, p. 179.</page><page sequence="32">96 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN historians.63 The question is not whether the modern exploration of subjectivity has produced new and significant truths about man. That it has done so would appear to be beyond dispute. The real question is whether social institutions and historical processes are no more than the externalized images of subjective life. Of this, one can have serious doubts. It was a major turning point in Freud's construction of psychoanalytic thought when he came to see that the stories his patients told him of childhood seductions and rapes were fantasies. From that moment, psychoanalysis restricted itself to the subjective life. Events in the patients' lives were not considered to be as important as the patients' responses to the events. The responses were patterned according to an inner psychic structure established in childhood. Therapy used and depended upon this pattern of response. By the mechanism of transference, the patient would react to the analyst as if he stood in loco parentis. Psychoanalysis has as its noble goal the restoration of the world to the patient and patient to the world. In isolation from the world, the patient comes to understand the hidden springs of his flight from the world. As soon as Freud had drawn the parallel between primitive myth and the mental lives of neurotics and children, he had committed himself to an explanation of the primitive mind which would exclude the world of phenomena and events, which would exclude knowledge of the world and social organization for dealing with the world. The starting-point, Freud believed, had to lie completely within the psyche. The problem of such an explanation goes beyond the issue of whether psychoanalysis can give an adequate account of the roots of man's social existence. The more troubling problem, which Freud had intuited in his dispute with Jung and which spurred him into the field of social theory, was whether psychoanalysis by itself could even give an adequate account of the human individual. For all his mysticism and occult trappings, Jung had raised a serious question and he had raised it from within the psychoanalytic movement. (Adler had preceded him in this.) Can an adequate account of the human individual exclude the concrete 63 "Whereas history teaches us that at each time something different has been, philosophy endeavours to assist us to the insight that at all times exactly the same was, is, and will be, in truth, the essence of human life, as of nature everywhere, exists complete in every present time, and therefore requires only depth of comprehension in order to be exhaustively known."" Schopenhauer, op. cit., Vol. 2, p. 441.</page><page sequence="33">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 97 systems of belief and social institutions of the particular human community of which he is a member? It has escaped notice that there is a clinical counter-part to Totem and Taboo. The magnificent case history of the 'Wolfman', "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis", is a marvelously rich analysis of an individual whom Freud was treating about the time of the composition of Totem and Taboo. The analysis of an actual patient would appear to take us far afield from the series of anthropological issues raised in Totem and Taboo. But two elements of the patient's analysis repeat the themes of Totem and Taboo: the substitute of an animal figure for the father and the use of religion as the symbolic working out of neurotic problems. The link between the two is made tighter by a note Freud appended to the case history in which he explained that he had written it in the aftermath of his controversy with Jung and Adler and that it forms part of a "polemic" directed against them. The patient was a neurotic adult who had already displayed neurotic symptoms in childhood. Since the neurosis had appeared in childhood, Freud saw this analysis as an opportunity to establish the decisive importance of infantile conflicts. If he could reconstruct the earlier form of the neurosis and work out its aetiology, he would demonstrate "the significance of the infantile factor . . . beyond any doubt."64 This was, it may be remembered, one of the major points of disagreement between Freud and Jung. Ernest Jones correctly explained the importance of this point. This is a matter of fundamental importance to the whole of Freud's theory of development. It also has endless ramifications. If, for instance, those pathogenic agencies may date from later life, being then projected backwards, it opens the door to all the cultural variations and influences, stressed particularly of late by Horney, which can for the most part be excluded if we are concerned only with the first couple of years of life. From a meticulous study of the data present in this case, Freud showed irrefutably that the theories recently propounded by Adler and Jung were contradicted in the crucial test of factual experience.65 (My italics) 64 S.E. XVII, p. 54. 65 Jones, op. cit., Vol. 2, p. 277. It should be noted that Jones had access to Freud's correspondence with Jung long before it was published.</page><page sequence="34">98 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN Freud's psychoanalytic theory postulated its own sufficiency to provide an exhaustive account of the inner life of the individual. It further asserted that the formative period of the personality lay in early childhood and that the personality was the result of purely intra-psychic conflicts dating from that time. Social and political institutions could therefore control and direct action but could never transform the human personality. This was the proposition which Freud entered social theory to defend. If the personality differed significantly from culture to culture, if social institutions could affect the inner life of man, his hopes and desires, his fears and needs, then psychoanalysis would always stand in need of history and sociology to complete its account of the human being. Moreover, psychoanalysis as a solution to human problems would have to yield to social change which would have a much wider impact than analyses of single individuals could ever have. The legislator not the analyst would be man's best hope for a restoration to health. In Totem and Taboo, Freud, by insisting that the fundamental institutions of society had roots in the original problems of the human psyche, attacked the proposition that the person is a product of a specific society. In the 'Wolfman' case, Freud continued the attack by showing the thoroughly and exclusively infantile roots of the human personality. Before a person was old enough to enter a social world which could influence and affect him, the essential structure of his personality had been cast. This double pronged attack on Jung converged on the final and permanent significance of origins. What was at the beginning, for the individual or for history, is decisive for all time. "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis" is a display of Freud at his very best. Freud connects symptoms and dreams, reconstructs the childhood of his adult Russian patient, and blends the diverse trends of the man's psychic life, past and present, into one coherent whole. Irresistibly, we are drawn back to the critical beginnings of the neurosis. The inevitable Oedipal drama unfolds before us: the viewing of the primal scene as the infant wakes one afternoon to find his parents engaged in sex; the castration threat which leads the child to be in terror of his own libidinal urges; and the search for substitutes for that which has been denied, a search which includes the formation of the classical symptoms of an obsessional neurosis. However, if the case is considered in the light of Jones's assurance that Freud had, by adducing this material, controverted his opponents with the "crucial test of factual experience", a serious difficulty</page><page sequence="35">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 99 arises. Crucial facts in this case turn out to be all wrong; the facts just do not correspond to the tragic scenario. In an addition which Freud wrote just four years after the original publication of the case, Freud admitted that the child may not have actually witnessed the primal scene. It may have been a fantasy based on the child's observations of animals copulating. Freud was convinced that the difference between fantasy and actual observation was not important because, again, what was of importance was not the event but the child's reaction to it. And indeed, this re-interpretation was useful because it relieved Freud of the obligation to show that the viewing of the primal scene was a component of every neurosis. But then at the least, it had to be shown that fantasizing the primal scene was universal in early childhood. (And in very early childhood: the patient was one and a half years old at the time of occurrence!) Moreover, in the actual facts of this case, the castration threat did not come from the father, nor even from a man. It was uttered by a woman, the child's nurse, and the child responded as if it had come from the father or, at least, Freud believed he did. But again, why did the child alter his own experience? Freud had an answer to these questions and it is best that we let him give it in his own words. The boy had to fit himself into a phylogenetic schema, and he did so, although his personal experiences may not have agreed with it. ... in spite of everything it was his father from whom in the end he came to fear castration. In this respect heredity triumphed over accidental experience: in man's prehistory it was unquestionably the father who practised castration as a punishment.66 Freud had returned to the archaic heritage, the universal inherited memories from a pre-historic past. But this time it was brought up to explain important discrepancies in a clinical analysis. Freud went on to say that a child catches hold of this phylogenetic experience where his own experience fails him. He fills in the gaps in individual truth with prehistoric truth; he replaces occurrences in his own life by occurrences in the life of his ancestors.67 66 S.E. XVII, p. 86. 67 Ibid., p. 97.</page><page sequence="36">100 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN Freud carried this principle as far as it could go in his system of thought; he made it the foundation of the Oedipus complex itself. the phylogenetically inherited schemata [are] . . . like the categories of philosophy, [which] are concerned with the business of 'placing' the impressions derived from actual experience. I am inclined to take the view that they are precipitates from the history of human civilization. The Oedipus complex which comprises a child's relation to its parents is one of them.68 This was not an ill-considered point made in a careless moment. The very same idea is repeated in the Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis which Freud intended as a general and authoritative statement of the major principles of psychoanalysis. I believe these primal phantasies ... are a phylogenetic endowment. ... It seems to me quite possible that all the things that are told us to-day in analysis as phantasy - the seduction of children, the inflaming of sexual excitement by observing parental intercourse, the threat of castration (or rather castration itself) - were once real occurrences in the primaeval times of the human family and that children in their phantasies are simply filling in the gaps in individual truth with prehistoric truth.69 What turns out to be, for Freud, the guarantor of the universality of the Oedipus complex was the survival of inherited pre-historic memories. No wonder he felt that "I cannot do without this factor in biological evolution." It was not merely a speculative and tangential excursion into social theory; it was basic to psychoanalytic theory itself. It is now apparent why Freud introduced and needed this principle of inherited memory. Freud wished to preserve a scientific bulwark against Jung's mystifications. And he wished to defend psycho- analysis against the implications of sociological and historical explanations of the human condition. The first objective could have been reached without recourse to an unsupportable and absurd 68 Ibid. p. 119. 69 S.E. XVI, p. 371.</page><page sequence="37">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 101 hypothesis. The second could not because the social and historical are not, in truth, reducible to the psychological. The idea of inherited memory satisfied Freud's need to meet both objectives. He thought he could simultaneously counter mysticism and sociology by recourse to biology. The irony was that the biological basis he employed was one which no biologist could ever entertain seriously. And Freud knew this. But he insisted on inherited memory because he needed it to be true. He grasped for this peculiar notion because it seemed to him to provide a biological foundation for his psychoanalytic theories. Such a foundation would preclude occult explanations and facilitate the attack on the "culturalist" or "environmentalist" school of thought. Freud wished to show that the active and causative forces in the life of the individual all lay within him as a biological inheritance. The flimsiness of the archaic heritage is an inevitable consequence of the impossibility of reaching that goal. No account of the human being can be complete without the recognition that whatever else the human being is, he is a representative of a particular society and bears the special impress of that society on his character. Freud entered the field of social theory to disprove the notion that alternation of social institutions could decisively change the character of the human being and of human life. But we are concerned with more than the intellectual history of the founder of psychoanalysis. The real question is how possible it is to integrate the human individual as Freudian psychoanalysis presents him into the tradition of modern progressive social thought with its emphasis on the malleability of man as a product of social institutions. The tortured efforts of Freud to establish the principle of inherited memory testify to the strength of his conviction that no such integration was possible. Such attempts have frequently been made by neo-Freudians like Horney and Fromm and by Marxists of the Freudian left. Certainly Freud's conservatism cannot be attributed to a failure to give due attention to this question. Nor is it attributable to his later political works, Civilization and Its Discontents and Moses and Monotheism, having been written in the bitter last years of his life. In the second decade of this century, Freud, at the height of his very considerable powers, carefully and deliberately rejected any social solution to the human problem. Nor will it do to reject the principle of inherited memory and then proceed to assimilate the Freudian theory into a theory of social progress. The presence of this doctrine emphasizes the purely individual character of Freudian psychoanalysis. And no one</page><page sequence="38">102 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN knew this better than Freud. The Freudian vision of the personality will not, without significantly distorting it, lend itself to a political theory of social progress. The power of Freudian thought lies in its ability to take seriously and present a coherent account of man's subjective life. We enter with Freud into a domain in which fantasies and inner responses are as important as real events and occurrences. It is a significant human reality and ought to be given its due. It is not, however, the whole of human reality. One need not accept the stubborn one-sidedness of Freud's vision of the human condition. He failed to see the autonomous character of the social world or its depth. Society creates, as Durkheim put it, "a whole world of sentiments, ideas and images which, once born, obey laws all their own ."70 This 'world' cannot, without impermissible simplification, be traced back to purely subjective origins in the human psyche. Nor can it be reduced even to its own historical origins. Once more it should be said, social institutions "obey laws all their own." They become part of the reality into which the human being is born and provide him as much a habitation as nature itself. Freud was always skeptical of man's capacity to act rationally. But Freud thought of rational action solely in terms of an individual making a decision. There is, however, a tradition of political thought at least as old as Aristotle which holds that, although at any given moment an individual's capacity for rational action may be diminished by passion or interest, human beings may incorporate their reason into a stable world of laws and institutions. People may discover a rational principle of action which they know will be generally good or beneficial and which they might be tempted to ignore in a particular situation in which it works against them. They accede to the principle's becoming a law enforceable in all instances. Their reason is represented by the law. This is expressed in Aristotle's famous definition of law as "reason free of passion." Laws and the institutions of society may be, whatever else they are or for whatever reasons they came into being, rational modes of dealing with reality. It is this aspect of the human world which Freud neglected when he sought to explain social institutions in terms of individual psychology. Something true and essential is lost when categories inappropriate to the study of society become the basis of an examination of society. But if it is improper to explain the social in terms of concepts 70 Durkheim, op. cit., p. 471.</page><page sequence="39">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 103 appropriate to the individual, to reverse the procedure will lead to distortions just as great. It will be remembered that what alarmed Freud was the attempt to "solve the problems of individual psychology with the help of material derived from social psychology." Those who adopt a one-sided sociological or historicist point of view tend to dissolve the ontological status of the human individual into that of a statistical variation of the general and typical. Psychoanalysis may be regarded as the heir to the great tradition of the nineteenth century novel with its extensive explorations of the inner life of human individuals. Like the novel, Freudian psychoanalysis confirms the status of the individual as being something more than a representative of a social type. The human individual can never be subsumed under the diverse social categories that constitute an important part of what he is. Jung, in his Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious, provided a lengthy analysis of a patient's drawings which Jung found to be similar to symbols of Eastern religion. He analyzed the patient's drawings by referring them to the meaning of these symbols. This method is alien to the central thrust of Freudian psychoanalysis. In the Interpretation of Dreams, Freud set forth the general principle that, We are not in general in a position to interpret another person's dream unless he is prepared to communicate to us the unconscious thoughts that lie behind its content.71 Although the principle admits of exceptions, it is, in general, the patient's associations alone that provide the content of interpretation. The individual cannot be taken to be no more than an instance of the general and the typical. Although Freud erred in his failure to see that the personality is unintelligible apart from its determinate cultural and social setting, he saw more clearly than his successors that the personality is not resolvable into purely sociological categories. In a totalitarian century, we must be especially grateful for such a lesson. Psychoanalytic theory and social theory, to be sure, cannot be totally separated insofar as they share a common subject-matter, the human being. But the human being as member of an organized system of social institutions is not the same as the human being as an individual feeling reflective entity. The categories and discoveries of 71 S.E. IV, p. 241.</page><page sequence="40">104 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN psychoanalytic and social theory are not mutually interchangeable. And neither one of these bodies of thought is reducible to the other. The traditional problem of the individual and society has been made more complex in the last century by the deepening of our knowledge about both the individual and society. Neither term now means quite what it meant a century ago. In the eighteenth century thinkers, who were excited by the monumental discoveries of modern physical science, hoped that they could apply the principles of physics to the study of society and human behavior. They engaged in what might be called a confusion of categories: the application of concepts and methods appropriate to one subject-matter to another and inappropriate subject-matter. Freud is our Newton. No account of human experience is now possible without reference to his work. Nonetheless, a study of his thought must lead us to conclude that psychoanalytic principles are not indiscriminately applicable to the study of all human problems. Psychoanalysis can do much, but it cannot, by itself, provide a complete account of the human being. To the question, is Freudian psychoanalysis neutral in regard to social theory, the answer must be a qualified no. It is in a good position to evaluate the costs to the individual of his life in society. It is not well situated to account for the other side of the ledger: society as the foundation of a distinctively human life. It is not that psychoanalysis implies a particular social theory, it is that the perspective of psychoanalysis is not an altogether appropriate basis for any social theory. Psychoanalysis is concerned with the psyche of the individual; it is concerned with the world only as it is experienced subjectively. The classic psychoanalytic question is "What does this mean to you?" The answer discloses a great deal about the "you". It tells us nothing about the "this". Psychoanalysis involves an extraordinarily extensive examination of the unique inner life of the individual. But social thought is primarily concerned with the objective character of the human world: the institutions and history of society and the action and behavior of people. Social thought enters the inner life of man only to seek a social consciousness, the attitudes and inner trends which people share as members of a social group: language, religion, morality and worldview. This is not to say that the psychoanalytic perspective is devoid of all political and ethical implications. A persistent problem of the secular age has been that with the loss of a transcendent moral order, it has been difficult to resist the claims of the state to unconditional moral</page><page sequence="41">Psychoanalysis and Social Theory 105 authority. We have returned to the classical Greek dilemma posed by Socrates to Crito. If the civilized man is the product of laws and institutions, how can an individual resist the authority of those laws and institutions? We have searched, often in vain, for the moral Archimedean point upon which the individual can stand against this authority. The modern has been torn between the unacceptable alternatives of either moral anarchy or total submission to the state. What I have called the Schopenhauerian tradition developed in order to establish a moral and ontological status for the individual independent of society. Psychoanalysis consummated this tradition. It spoke of the individual as individual, not as member of a family, class or nation. It supported the status of the individual as an autonomous being. Its strength lies in its alliance with the individual against society. Its weakness, for which the Rouseauian position is the corrective, is its tendency to issue in a thoroughgoing subjectivism, a confusion of the inner processes of individuals with the reality of the external world. When objective reality - nature, including other living human beings, and the institutions of society - is reduced to the psyche of an individual, a frightful world-loss occurs. Such a world-loss produces people who are self-immersed and no longer competent to deal effectively with the world. On the other hand, what ensues from a complete loss of the individual as self is a totalitarian universe. Psychoanalysis and social theory are not merely two different methodologies. They correspond to the duality of the human condition: the human being as simultaneously both an individual self and a member of organized society. Psychoanalysis and social theory are not mutually contradictory. They pertain to different human realities which are not reducible to each other. They are valid only so long as they remain within their own categorical boundaries. The distinction which I have elaborated parallels the classic but no longer vivid distinction between the private and the public. Psychological man ought not to be permitted to enter the public realm, because whenever he does, he destroys its essential character. Action is not the same as acting out. To the former, moral judgment is proper; to the latter, it is not. The notions of responsibility and obligation are necessarily eroded by the psychological ethos that quite properly calls not for judgment but for sympathetic understanding. The fantasies appropriate to one's inner life and to the consulting room must terminate at the threshold of the objective world where those fantasies may involve consequences to other human beings.</page><page sequence="42">106 LARRY DAVID NACHMAN Similarly, something devastating and politically dangerous happens if the public world invades the psychological domain. The categories of action - responsibility and obligation - may not be legitimately extended to purely inner processes. Public self-revelation, whether voluntary or coerced, destroys the nature of intimacy and trivializes all personal relations. The confusion of psychoanalysis and social theory mirrors the interpénétration of psychological man and the public man. The result is a diminution of both and a loss of confidence in the capacity of the self to sustain the demands of life and of society to deal effectively with social issues.</page></plain_text>
