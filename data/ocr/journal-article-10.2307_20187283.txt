With one major exception, KATOYPON, the text is printed here as it appears in the standard edition of Snell and Maehler.1 Interpretation of this passage is problematic. Is the correct text in line 87f. Kax' oupov (Kenyon and, apart from Festa, all subsequent editors) or KcxTO-upov (Housman)? Does Minos order the ship to hurry on its course or does he order it stopped? These questions are not trivial, for they affect how we understand Bacchylides' treatment of Minos. Scholars have generally been eager to see Minos in a very harsh light, and so have endorsed Kenyon's text and the reading of the passage that it necessitates. A notable exception is Giesekam, who has argued persuasively for a more favourable view of Minos in the poem.2 He has supported Housman's text, but his argument is brief and can be supplemented in important ways. The issue hinges principally on two points, viz. the precise force of ?c%ev, and the form and meaning of what the papyrus transmits as KATOYPON. Also relevant is the significance of the ex?pa ?S?c of line 89. On the usual view, icat' o^pov is read, and the Doric infinitive ?cxev is understood as equivalent to e'xeiv (cf. Jebb ad loc). The resulting text is translated "[Minos] gave command to keep the cunningly-wrought ship before the wind" (Jebb). Jebb cites, as examples of this alleged use of ?'x for "steering a ship on a certain course," Od. 10.91, ev0' o? y' e?cco n?vxzc e%ov v?ac ?|i(pieXiccac, and Hdt. 6.95, ?vGe?nev 5? o\&gt; rcap? tt^v f?rceipov eixov tac v?ac i0i) xov xz 'EXXtjckovtod Kai xx[c 0pr|?Kr|c. Of these only the second instance is relevant (though it is a more generalized reference than the passage under discussion); in the Homeric passage ?xov is used of bringing ships to anchor (in fact, Privitera translates it in Heubeck's text by "arrestarono"). Consequently, there is no parallel for the proposed usage in early poetry. Moreover, the assumption that ?cxev stands for exeiv in the sense required is dubious. In early texts meanings of ?cxco are almost always derived from the basic sense "hold back, restrain."3 Furthermore, this is its meaning elsewhere in 1 B.Snell and H.Maehler, Bacchylidis: Carmina cum Fragmentis (Leipzig 1970). I have also printed Mo?pa with a capital letter, acknowledging the presence of the anthropomorphic figure: cf. Aesch. Cho. 911, kciIt?vSe to?vdv Mo?p' eTt?pcovev n?pov. 2 GJ.Giesekam, Papers of the Liverpool Latin Seminar ed. F.Cairns 2 (1976) 237-252. 3 Cf. LSJ s.v.; G.C.Wakker, LfgrE s.v. ?c%&lt;?

But without clearer articulation in the Greek a quasi adjectival usage of the prepositional phrase is highly unlikely. Moreover, koct' o\&gt;pov seems to occur in contexts in which motion is implied, and there is no example of a ship being stopped koct' oupov.6 Consequently, if we print koct' oupov, we shall be driven to understand ?cxev as Jebb and most commentators do, however much this diverges from the normal semantic range of the verb. Housman suggested another approach to the passage, arguing that KaToupov, not KocT'oxipov, is the correct reading, and translating "he ordered them to stop the ship, which was running before the wind."7 The adjective KcxTO-upoc is elsewhere unattested,8 but the formation is exactly parallel to excovpoc. As his translation indicates, Housman believes that KaToupoc means "running before the wind." Jebb, however, objects: "But, even with KcxToupov, the sense would be, 'to keep the ship before the wind': kotodpov could not stand for xr\v koct' oupov nhzovcav."9 It is clear that Jebb's position has been a decisive factor in banishing KtxTOupov to the apparatus of later editions, but I would argue that Jebb is wrong. Just as ercoupoc is related to ?rco'up?co/?rco'up?Ccu, so Katcupoc stands in a close relation to KocTO'upoc?/KocTO'Dpi??). In each case the meaning of the adjective is determined by the semantic range of the verb. ?7co\)poc?/?7tO'opi?c? means "to blow onwards (i.e. favourably)" (cf. LSJ s.w.), and so ercoupoc is understood as "blowing 4 5.24, ox&gt; viv (se. a?ETOv) Kopaxpai laey?taxc ?cxoua yatac, / o\&gt;5' ?'XJbc amii?iTac / Sxtcna?itahx ic?nata; 17.23, tc^e |?eyaAo?xov ftpooe ?iav; cf.

This proposal won the support of a number of distinguished scholars in the years immediately following its publication: see Giesekam (above n.2) 250 n.28. Particularly noteworthy is the approval of Wilamowitz (cf. his Bakchylides [Berlin 1898] 28, where he translates, "zu halten / gebot er das Schiff unter dem Winde"), and P.Maas, Die neuen Responsionsfreiheiten bei Bakchylides und Pindar 2 (Berlin 1921) lOf. Among editors only Festa (Florence 1916) 106f., has adopted the text. More recently, Giesekam alone has supported Housman, but his arguments have not persuaded subsequent scholarship: the Teubner text is accepted without comment by A.P.Bumett, The Art of Bacchylides (Cambridge, Mass. 1985) 17, 20; G.Ieran?, QS 30 (1989) 175. R.Scodel, Hermes 112 (1984) 139 n.8, draws attention to the issue, but supports Jebb's objections to Housman's text. 8 As Giesekam (246) notes, this fact should trouble no one: a very large number of ctrcct? tay?iaEva are attested in Bacchylides. 9 Jebb offered these same objections at greater length in CR 12 (1898) 154. Scodel (above n.7, 139 n.8) mistakenly supposes that Jebb objects to the syntax of Housman's proposal.</page><page sequence="3">34 C.G.Brown favourably" (cf. Soph. Tr. 954 with Kamerbeek's note; Clem. Alex. Paed. 1.7.54). The meaning of KaTOupoc can be defined in the same way. The verbs mean "to sail before the wind" (cf. LSJ s.w.); moreover, it has been overlooked that Eustathius glosses KocTOupi?eiv with to koct' o?pov nXzzxv (Comm. in II. 4.661.15 van der Valk). KcxTO-opoc, then, is not an adjective formed directly from the phrase koct' ovpov; consequently, Jebb was incorrect to say that the adjective could not mean ttiv koct' oupov TT??oDcocv, for that is precisely what it should mean. In light of the preceding discussion, we can conclude that Housman's KCXTO-upov coheres perfectly with the normal usage of ?cx : Minos orders the ship to be stopped. As Housman saw, KCXTO-upov picks up the opening passage of the poem (5-7):10 xr{kavyzi y?p [?v] (pape? ?opfVioCl 7C?TV0[v] OC?pOCl kAa)T(xc eKocTi 7t[e]Xe|ioc?Yi5oc 'A0?v[occ After Theseus dives into the sea, Minos orders his crew to check the ship that has hitherto been sailing before the wind, but the gods, whose will and influence are much in evidence in the poem,11 do not allow it; the ship speeds on. In the face of the power of the gods the sea lord of Cnossus is unable to stop his ship, for Moira has determined otherwise. On the usual reading of the passage, line 89 (Motpoc 8' eTepocv eTc?pcov' ?5?v) has seemed ambiguous:12 the ship is held to its course; the eT?poc ?S?c then must be metaphorical, referring to the course of events, not to the course of the ship. But as Housman noted, the context suggests a more literal meaning for ?o?c, and this suits his reading of the passage: the course of the ship is different from that commanded by Minos. With Housman's text, the villainy of Minos is minimized. And this is surely correct. Bacchylides does not present a crude conflict between a hero and a villain, but rather a clash between two heroes.13 On this sort of reading, we have a subtler and more interesting poem. It is also salutary to remember in this regard that the conflict between Achilles and Hector in the Iliad is no simple polarization.14 University of Western Ontario Christopher G.Brown 10 See J.Stem, RBPh 45 (1967) 40-47, for the careful balance between the opening and closing sections of the poem. Cf. more recently Ieran? (above n.7) 161. 111 discuss this more fully in "The Power of Aphrodite: Bacchylides 17.10," Mnemosyne (forthcoming). 12 This is one of two examples of 'conscious ambiguity' in Bacchylides detected by R.F.Renehan, GRBS 10 (1969) 226. The other is Bacch. 16.30-35. 13 For a detailed exposition of this sort of view, see Giesekam (above n.2), especially 243f., on the careful delineation of Minos' heroic stature in the poem. 14 I thank Professors R.L.Fowler, D.E.Gerber, and B.C.MacLachlan for commenting on this note in draft</page></plain_text>
