Waters Occupant Restraint Systems Section, Office of Vehicle Systems Research, National Bureau of Standards THE OFFICE OF VEHICLE Systems Research in the National Bureau of Standards is concerned with the research, develop- ment, testing, and evaluation necessary to provide the tech- nical basis for recommended safety performance standards of motor vehicle systems. O.V.S.R. also develops the test meth- ods required to determine compliance to these standards. Recommendations based upon NBS research are made to the National Highway Safety Bureau of the Department of Trans- portation which has the responsibility for the issuance of the safety standards. One major area of research deals with occupant restraint systems. The static tests of seat belt assemblies involving tensile strength, color fastness, abrasion resistance, and other properties were developed originally for the Federal Stan- dards for Seat Belts for Use in Motor Vehicles by the National Bureau of Standards. The static tests are continually being expanded and improved. Dynamic test simulation of colli- sions is an important step in the development of the safety of performance of the occupant restraint system . A dynamic test device has been designed and built by NBS and is fully instrumented to develop dynamic performance standards not only for the seat belt and upper torso restraint but also for other components of the restraint system. Under NBS sponsorship, the 6571st Aeromedicai Research Laboratory at Holloman Air Force Base is running experimental sled tests on the Daisy Decelerator using anthropomorphic dummies and human volunteer subjects. The data included represent the major portion of the work accomplished during the fiscal year 1968 by the Oc- cupant Restraint Systems Section of O.V.S.R. PART I - DYNAMIC SLED TESTS AT HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE The immediate objectives of the series of tests at Hollo - man Air Force Base were to provide a technical basis for dynamic tests for compliance of seat belts. Static test spec- ifications for seat belts have been established and published but a dynamic test specification is unresolved. It is gen- erally agreed that since the seat belt performs its function under dynamic conditions, it should be tested under such Note: Research reported in this paper is being carried out under the sponsorship of the National Highway Safety Bureau of the Department of Transportation. The opinions, findings, and conclusions in this paper are those of the au- thors and not necessarily those of the National Highway Safety Bureau. ABSTRACT Extensive research in the field of occupant restraints has been made by the Office of Vehicle Systems Research at the National Bureau of Standards. Portions of that research, consisting of human dynamic sled tests at Holloman Air Force Base, tests of restraint systems on the NBS sled, and a variety of strength and degradation tests of seat belts are reported. The geometry of restraint systems in 1968 model production automobiles is documented. Results of 75 human tests reported indicate the nature of human kinematic response to deceleration in seat belts and the forces the seat belt might be expected to withstand. Requirements for dynamic tests of seat belts have been in- vestigated as well as degradation tests for improvement of the federal standards for seat belts for use in motor vehicles. 1023</page><page sequence="2">1024 R. W. ARMSTRONG AND H. P. WATERS conditions. There is an urgent need for data relating to automobile occupant restraint systems operating under dy- namic conditions. The most pressing problems are deter- mining how humans react to deceleration and the similarity of these reactions to those of anthropomorphic dummies. Humans have been decelerated in aircraft or spacecraft- type restraints. However, these restraints provide greater protection for vehicle occupants than the systems presently feasible, or salable, for automobiles. One of the reasons for this is the use in aircraft of more and wider restraining belts. During deceleration the aircraft-type harness distri- butes the loads over a greater body area than the automobile restraint. The data from aircraft occupant restraint studies with this difference in belt configuration are not usable for analyzing automobile restraints. Since there is almost no information on humans decelerated in automotive -type restraints, several series of human tests were conducted on the Daisy Decelerator (1)*. Because of the urgent need for human data and time and budget limitations, it was neces- sary to conduct tests that would cover several areas of con- cern and indicate general trends, not give detailed infor- mation in one area. In some areas the number of tests is very limited. This made it undesirable to do much combin- ing of data at this time. Thus in the graphs which follow, for example, a particular data point indicates, the maxi- mum load produced in the lap belt for a particular run. This type of presentation will enable the reader to analyze the data and draw his own conclusions. Due to the scarcity of information about human reaction to real or simulated auto crashes, it was considered necessary to present the data immediately and make some generaliza - tions. A more detailed analysis of the tests reported here is in progress. Additional tests of dummies and humans are being conducted to provide more specific information. The development of a dynamic test for automobile re- straints must be directed towards a relatively simple, in- expensive, reliable and reproducible test. The use of an elaborate and expensive dynamic test would make it im- possible to sample a statistically significant portion of the annual production of seat belts, approximately 50 million. In order to develop the practical dynamic test, effort was concentrated on compiling data in the following five areas where adequate information does not exist: 1. Seat Configuration - Data are needed to design a test seat which will simulate a typical auto seat and yet be rugged enough to endure repeated impacts. 2. Degree of Dummy Articulation - Because of cost and test reproducibility, it is desired to use a test dummy of minimum articulation for dynamic acceptance tests. It is thus necessary to determine to what degree articulation may be eliminated while still reproducing human behavior in the seat belts. 3. Impact Pulse Shape - A deceleration pulse with a 1/2 sine wave shape of proper magnitude has generally been ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. accepted as an adequate simulation of the deceleration of the floor pan of an automobile in a head-on barrier colli- sion. The effect of deviations from a standard half sine wave impact pulse must be determined so that accuracy of test requirements can be defined. 4. Critical Angle of Impact - The worst possible impact orientation in the yaw direction must be determined for the test specification to make sure that tests of seat belts are made at loads and dynamic conditions which insure the greatest protection commensurate with seat belt cost and accident frequency. 5. Anchorage Locations - It is important to know the effect of lap belt load with change in angle of the belt with the horizontal and with change in spread of the an- chorages. Effects of changing the location of the upper end of the upper torso restraint and other restraint geometries will be studied in the future. There were several reasons for choosing the facility at Holloman for these tests. The Daisy Decelerator can pro- duce an acceptable half -sine wave deceleration pulse and has well -experienced personnel operating it. In addition, Holloman has an experienced human test population under strict medical supervision. It should be emphasized that the human tests were designed to study human kinematics and forces resulting from simulated frontal collisions. They were not in any way intended to determine human tolerance levels. These tests not only required the cooperation of the 6571st Aeromedicai Research Laboratory, but the contribu- tion of test materials by the following organizations: Gen- eral Motors, Ford Motor Co., American Motors, Chrysler Corp., Alderson Research Laboratory, Sierra Engineering Co., and the Fisher Corp. TEST FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT The following description of the test facility was made by Mr. Richard Chandler of Holloman Air Force Base, who at the time the tests were conducted was the civilian chief of the Bio -Effects Division of the 6571st Aeromedicai Re- search Laboratory and under whose guidance these tests were performed. The Daisy Decelerator (Fig. 1) is one of the oldest im- pact test facilities designed for bio -dynamic testing in the United States. It was initiated in 1953 under the direction of Col. John P. Stapp, who was then head of the laboratory, and has since grown and been improved so that it may handle a wide diversification of tests. The two outstanding features of this facility are versatility and reliability. Versatility because of the equipment design, reliability because of the equipment design and the experience of the people who run it. The facility was originally designed as a deceleration facility which implies a means of extracting some energy out of the system. Energy is imparted to the system by means of an air gun. It is a closed piston system which accelerates the test vehicle up to the desired impact ve- locity which may be anywhere from 5 ft/sec up to about</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1025 Fig. 1 - Daisy Decelerator, Holloman Air Force Base 180 ft/sec, or 125 mph. The test sled is then released from the air gun and coasts into the water brake. A free length of track is necessary for a coasting phase of the sled so that the test item, whether it be a mechanical system such as a dummy and seat belt or a biological system such as a human being or test animal, may reach some degree of stabiliza- tion àfter the acceleration phase and thus not have any ac* celeration effect during the impact phase. There are two basic track lengths, one of 120 ft and one of 240 ft. For the tests conducted for the Bureau of Standards, the shorter track was used because of the low velocities. The braking system is hydraulic, making use of momentum exchange to provide a controlled and adjustable sled deceleration pulse. The impact limitations are essentially two: one of decelera- tion force (tests normally do not exceed 200,000 lb force for human tests) and one of stroke distance, which is limited to 4 ft. The test population consists of volunteer air force per- sonnel on active duty at Holloman Air Force Base. These people are either officers or airmen who are given an in- centive pay to participate in the tests. Most of them, how- ever, have a primary interest in assisting in the space pro- gram, and in this case, the traffic safety program. The test personnel are young healthy males. Their health is maintained and monitored by the air force. They are experienced test riders who have been through impacts before and know what to look for and what to expect. The riders know which effects are good and which are bad. This is not the normal population driving automobiles, thus the first limitation in using this data. SEAT BELT PERFORMANCE WITH PRODUCTION AUTOMOBILE SEATS PURPOSE - When a seat belt is worn, making an angle of approximately 45 deg with the horizontal, a large ver- tical component of force is present under high deceleration causing considerable deflection of the soft seats used in domestic automobiles. When a hard seat pan is used for test purposes, no such deflection is possible. The motion Fig. 2 - Setup for seat test with Research Laboratory 175-lb nominally 50 percentile dummy, F -50 series. of the occupant is measured by his hip point moving forward along the angle of the hard rigid seat. Presently proposed dynamic test seat pan configurations recommend either 0 or a 1 0 deg slope up under the knees to conform with the appearance of the production seat. The data obtained also establishes the seat belt loads and kinematics of dummies in production seats at essenti- ally two sled deceleration levels, 15 and 30 g. The 15 g level was chosen so that there might be a direct comparison made with dummies and humans on hard seats. The 30 g level was chosen as being at the severe injury or near fatal level for seat belt restraint systems. PROCEDURE - 1965 production bucket seats from the four major domestic manufacturers were used. These seats were welded to plates by their supporting channels, even though it was realized that the angle that these seats made with the floor was not precisely as it appears in the vehicle. (In some cars the seat is mounted on a tilted floor pan, rais- ing the front seat support.) By using a number of seats and averaging the performance characteristics, the potential- error in the determination of the angle of trajectory of the hip point (hinge between torso and upper leg) of the subject under seat belt restraint was minimized. Further, a study of all types of seats indicates that the front edge of bench seats deform more than the bucket seats tested. Fig. 2 shows the general test setup for a production seat test using an Alderson Research Laboratory 175 lb nominally 50 percentile dummy of the F -50 series. A brand new lap belt and upper torso restraint was used for each test even if the deceleration did not exceed 3 g, as in some later runs on the hard seat. The seat belts for the tests were especially made of a single run of webbing and are of the pushbutton design that two companies manu- facture for use by two large U. S. producers of automobiles. The belts are installed for the test by establishing the initial tension at 5 lb; tension during the test is determined by Lebow transducers, Model No. 3371, on each belt segment.</page><page sequence="4">1026 R. W. ARMSTRONG AND H. P. WATERS Fig. 3 - Oscillograph record from sled run using anthropormor- phic dummy The transducer has a strain gauge mounted on beams holding cross bars and the webbing of the seat belt is woven through the bars. A bending moment is produced in the bars pro- portional to the load in the webbing. During many of the tests, records of chest and head acceleration in the dummies and chest accelerations of humans were recorded. Displace- ment of these subjects was recorded on high speed film by the provision of dots and stripes as shown on Fig. 39. Cam- eras used were one 35 mm operating at 500 frames /sec and three 16mm operating at 1000 frames/sec. The deceleration, velocity and displacement of the sled were measured and recorded on an oscillograph. Two seat belt restraint con- figurations were used through the entire series of tests, namely lap lelt and lap belt with a separate belt for the upper torso restraint. To avoid the ponderous expression "lap belt only restraint system," "lap belt of the combined restraint sys- tem" and "upper torso belt of the combined restraint sys- tems," the abbreviations: "lap belt, type 1," "lap belt, type 2," and "torso, type 2," will be used throughout this paper. Also the term "belt loads" will be used in place of "belt loop loads." The lap belt was installed so that when worn by the subject it made an angle of 45 deg with the horizontal direction of travel of the sled. The loop length of the lap belt was approximately 42 in. with the anchorages approximately 26 in. apart. The effective distance may vary slightly because of different seat widths. The location of the upper anchorage of the upper torso belt was approximately 12 in. above the point of the shoulder of the dummy, 12 in. behind the center line of the shoulder and 37 in. off the floor of the sled. It is 6 in. off the center line of the seat. The seat is 7-7/8 in. off the floor where the buttocks of the dummy touches. The upper torso belt is tightened with a 3 in. block between the chest and the belt. The block is removed once initial 5 lb tension is established. The Alderson Research Laboratory 175 lb Model F-50 dummy' s joints were set at lg, which means that the frictional joints of the dummy were adjusted so that the arms, for example, will just fall under the influence of gravity. This setting is referred to throughout the entire series of tests as "loose joints." "Tight joint" setting is an adjustment which requires maximum effort of one person to flex the joint, this not being a precise setting but adequate to demonstrate any possible difference in dummy performance in selected tests. The deceleration pulse (deceleration versus time) used in all runs was essentially a half sine wave shape and at the selected g levels, very repetitive in shape from run to run. For decelerations from velocities of 20 ft /sec or less, a 9 in. stopping distance was used. All other runs, up to 44 ft/sec, were made with a stopping distance of 19 in. RESULTS - The data pertinent to the seat belt loads de- veloped in the production seats are given in Table 1. Fig. 3 is a typical oscillograph record from a sled run using an anthropomorphic dummy. In some instances a graph is plotted even though only two or three data points are avail- able since this is the most convenient way to compare re- sults between different tests and observe trends. Fig. 4 is a plot of the displacement angle of the hip point versus deceleration in g's for the lap belt, type 1, on the A RL -Model F-50 dummy in five different bucket seats from 1965 production. Each point on the graph represents a dif- ferent test. The displacement angle is computed at the maximum vertical displacement of the hip point with re- spect to the sled using the simultaneous horizontal displace- ment of the hip point with respect to the sled.

The significant factor is that all angles are negative. It appears logical for the angle at high decelerations to be less since the initial vertical softness of the seat is appar- ently overcome by the vertical component of the seat belt load causing the dummy to "bottom." Thus, additional displacement can come about only by horizontal displace- ment, effectively reducing the resultant angle with little increased vertical displacement.

The dotted line on the graph is eye -fitted to show general trend of the data. Similar presentations are made in Fig. 7 for the lap belt, type 2, and Fig. 8 for the torso, type 2. Note that the load in lap belt, type 2, attains about 75°/o of that experienced with the lap belt, type 1, at the same "g" level. There is a variation of about 20°/o in the load data on the five seats at the 15 g level. Throughout the entire series of tests, proportioning of the total load to the torso and the lap belt varies greatly both with dummy or human.

During the tests on production seats there were runs in which the lap belt was cut while under load by metal por- tions of the seats. Fig. 10 shows how the seat trim was de- formed, permitting the engagement of a sharp edge to cut the webbing. It is not known whether this would actually happen in the vehicle since the geometry of the seat belt was not identical to that used in the vehicle. It appears from an examination of several vehicles that an angle col- lision could cause the seat belt to engage critical metal areas on some seats.</page><page sequence="7">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1029 S) 5I 5 O ' O ^ O 4 s &lt; &lt; 3 g -* o -* y CL ^ O 2 o /4- - o 3 I yći / 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 DECELERATION (g) Fig. 8 - Seat belt performance with auto seats - upper torso of combined restraint, 1965 production bucket seats, ARL dummy 175 lb, half sine pulse Fig. 9 - Damage to bucket seat during simulated crash Fig. 10 - Webbing cut during simulated crash One failure of a seat belt buckle occurred during this series of tests. Apparently under certain test conditions with the ARL -Model F-50 dummy, the lap belt when used alone slides into the dummy at the mid -section in such a fashion that the belt buckle is edge loaded. Edge loading Fig. 11 - Damage between tongue recess and buckle latch of seat belt on the particular seat belt used causes a camming action on the tongue, which creates point loading in the interface between the tongue recess and the buckle latch, in turn causing a material failure of the tongue (Fig. 11). The belt load at the time of failure was 3550 lb. The buckle was immediately taken under study by the manufacturer and a design change was made to eliminate this peculiar failure. Many tests were made using this belt design and dummy at loads much higher, up to a maximum of 6800 lb without failure. (The static tensile strength requirement in the Federal specification is 5000 lb.) SEAT BELT PERFORMANCE WITH VARYING SEAT PAN ANGLE PURPOSE - A limited number of tests were conducted in order to further establish the angle of the seat pan of a rugged seat which would withstand repeated tests. The rugged or hard seat must produce an environment which simulated dynamic conditions observed in the usage of seat belts in production seats. PROCEDURE - Tests were conducted in the following manner. Variations in seat belt loads were measured for varying g levels and seat pan angles in a hard seat with the ARL Model F-50 dummy constrained in the same manner as the tests in the production seats. The seat, designed and constructed by NBS personnel, was capable of having the seat back and seat pan adjusted to angles that simulated the effective angles seen in the production seat tests. The angle of the seat back was determined by measure- ment of the angle of the line formed by the shoulder and hip points of several human test subjects sitting in the pro- duction seats as mounted. The configuration of the seat and the seat belt anchorages are shown in Fig. 12. Although it was recognized that the friction between dummy and human subjects and the ma- terial of the seat influences the seat belt load, this factor</page><page sequence="8">1030 R. W.

The limited data taken from Table 2 indicates that a reduction of seat belt load is affected by increasing the angle of the seat and thus the interference to the dummy's forward motion. This data was at nominally 15 g and, for comparative pur- poses, the average belt loads obtained with the dummy in the 1965 production bucket seats as indicated. Fig. 14 presents data obtained under identical circumstances at 30 g nominal. Identical experiments were conducted for the combined restraints and the loads for the effect on the lap belt and upper torso restraint are plotted in Figs. 15-18. When the total load, that is, the sum of the lap belt and torso, type 2, is plotted, there appears to be no significant change of loading with change in seat angle. This performance was confirmed on the NBS dynamic sled in the supplementary tests discussed in Part II of this report.

In these tests, the same geometry and tension was used for human tests as in earlier dummy tests in production seats, and the seat pan angle for human tests set at minus 5 deg.</page><page sequence="10">1032 R. W. ARMSTRONG AND H. P. WATERS For comparative purposes, all the remaining tests on dummies in the NBS seat were run with this seat pan angle. It would appear from the data that the performance of production seats could be improved by providing a more rigid cross bar on the seat under the knees in order to reduce the seat collapse and thus effectively reduce the negative seat pan angle. Further, it might be possible to permit only the back of the seat pan to move down under the vertical component of the seat belt, thereby increasing the positive seat pan angle. This should reduce the belt loads when the buttocks plow into the seat. It is generally accepted that the vertical forces on the spine should be limited to less than 17 g, thus imposing a limit to which the seat pan should be tilted. HUMAN RUNS ON THE NBS SEAT PURPOSE - Very few human tests have been made in a controlled environment using seat belt restraints adjusted in the conventional user's manner. Any tests of this nature which will relate human performance to that of the anthro- pomorphic dummy must be of considerable value. The tests extend the knowledge of the human's response in a crash simulator. The tests conducted at Holloman Air Force Base were not designed in any way to determine a pattern of injury or to determine human limitations with regard to crash severity. Tests were primarily conducted to determine the character and magnitude of seat belt loads which might be expected in a severe crash. The first of three series of tests done to date involve 23 runs by 20 volunteers on the NBS hard seat mounted on the Daisy Decelerator. The tests were conducted in order to make the best possible estimation of the performance that humans might make had they been run in the production seats of the previous tests. It was also hoped that some ex- trapolation could be made from these tests conducted at voluntary tolerance g levels (less than 17 g) to the level of 30 g which is presently estimated as being near the sur- vivable limit level of crash. A second series was run to determine the repeatability of the data obtained in the first series. Thus, as many as possible of the same subjects were run. The second series of tests was also used to develop a pedal force gauge which would measure the muscular effort of the leg during the decelerations. A third series of tests was designed to determine spec- ifically the contribution of the muscular leg restraint. The runs of the last two series of tests also contribute data to the general knowledge of human response and the capability of the present seat belts to restrain humans. PROCEDURE - The human test population for the first series of 23 tests consisted of 20 male USAF personnel with ranks from Airman Third Class to Captain, weights of 116- 187 lb, and heights of 66-72 in. Most of the subjects have two or three years' experience riding deceleration sleds with a minimum of one ride per month. Fig. 19 - Position of subject for test ride The population for the second series of tests consisted of 14 male USAF personnel with ranks from Airman First Class to Captain, weights of 114-190 lb, and heights of 66-74 in. The third series of tests were conducted on 15 USAF males with ranks from Airman First Class to Major, weights of 114-191 lb, heights of 66-74 in., and ages 21-38 years. In the first series of tests the humans were restrained either with lap belt, type 1, or with a lap belt and torso, type 2. Prior to deceleration the seat belts were anchored and adjusted in the manner of the previously reported dummy tests. The subjects were instructed to ride with hands clasped, arms between legs as shown in Fig. 19. A footrest was necessary to give the riders some additional feeling of security and provide representative load distribution. A record was made of the seat belt loads, deceleration of the sled, velocity of the sled prior to deceleration, water brake pressure and biomedical readout of EKG and blood pressure. High speed motion pictures were used to measure displace- ment of the subject and his various body components. In the next two series of tests, in addition to the data above, the loads exerted by the legs of the riders of the sled were measured by a pedal force device for each foot especially designed and built by personnel of NBS and the 6571st Aeromedicai Research Laboratory, Holloman Air Force Base. A sketch of the instrumentation and its method of operation appears in Fig. 20. The pedal force instrument was sloped at 45 deg with the horizontal providing a flat platform for each foot (Fig. 21). The forces perpendicular to the 45 deg plane and parallel to the 45 deg plane in the direction of the sled travel and perpendicular to the sled travel were measured by appropriate strain gauges. Mark- ings were appropriately placed upon the human, Fig. 19, so that photometric determination could be made of his body movements during the simulated crash from high speed mo- tion picture films taken from several angles at a rate of 1000 frames /sec.

The identical procedure was followed for data obtained under identical test conditions for the lap belt, type 2, and is plotted in Figs. 25 and 26. Likewise, Figs. 27 and 28 represent data obtained for the torso, type 2. Fig. 29 indicates the division of the loads into the lap belt and the torso, type 2. The load on the seat belt varies between 32 and 78%. Part of this surprisingly wide variation may be attributable to the degree of restraint made by the subject's legs. The authors are indebted to General Motors for the ex- cellent photometric analysis of the 23 human runs of this series. The graphic presentation of the kinematic response of the subject for each run appears in Appendix B of this paper. The results of the next series of human tests indicate there is considerable force exerted into the footrest of the NBS test seat. The identical test set-up was used with the addition of the pedal force transducer on the footrest. Data from the second series appears in Table 4. The following analysis is made with regard to the variation of seat belt loads compared to the first series. Fig. 30 is a plot of the loop loads in lap belt, type 1, versus g for the data in Table 4, with the loop load data adjusted proportional to the body weight of the subject to represent the 162 lb 50th percentile male.

The fourth curve on each of the two graphs was determined by the least squares method combining the data of all three series of tests. The third series of tests was the subject of a paper presented at the 12th Stapp Car Crash Conference, 1968 (2). The tests indicate that the sub- jects impose a preload in the pedal force indicators in anti- cipation of the deceleration and that the total horizontal forces attributable to the muscular restraint during the de- celeration ranged 132-822 lb. Fig. 36 is a typical oscillo- graph trace of a human run in this series. This force con- sists of two major components: first, the preload made by pushing against the back of the seat which remains near the same level throughout the deceleration and second, a mass which is equivalent to 27.7 lb consisting of shoes, feet, lower leg, and part of the upper leg which acts as if fixed to the footrest. Additional details regarding the effect these forces have on energy absorption by muscular restraint appears in the referenced paper. One of the important factors in devising a dummy for compliance testing is the proportioning of the loads into the lap belt and the torse, type 2. The data from the sec- ond and third series of human tests are summarized in this regard in Fig. 37. The data indicates that in the second series of tests the lap belt assumed an average of 62.6 °/o of the total load of the combined restraint and 56.1 °/o in the third series. EFFECT OF ARTICULATION OF DUMMY ON SEAT BELT LOADS PURPOSE - Dynamic compliance tests of seat belts must be as realistic as possible within the limits of eco- nomic capability. At present, there are several very so- phisticated anthropomorphic dummies used for research purposes. These dummies under high g decelerations per- form in a manner which approaches human behavior. Un- fortunately the initial cost and upkeep is such that it appears to be economically unfeasible to use them for compliance tests on a statictically significant number of production seat 85| 5] ^ 80 DD D _ 70 9 &lt; D 3 60 5-- ■2- n-e 2 DD ¡¡J 50 5 *-*■ o CD o o -I ¿A &lt; c FEB.AVG. - 56.1% ¡5 r_J J c NOV.

In an effort to develop data for a less costly, more rugged test device, a series of tests of five dummies with varying degrees of articulation were made and compared to human performance. PROCEDURE - The following dummies were used in the study: 1. Wooden Torso Block - 162 lb - weighted to have the mass distribution of the seated Alderson F-50 dummy. The geometric proportion is scaled up from the SA E Child Static test block for Type 3 restraints, SAE J4c. See Fig. 38. 2. Alderson - Military F-50 - 175 lb in extensively used condition. See Fig. 39. 3. NBS Sandbag - 162 lb weighted with a mixture of sand and sawdust so that the head, torso, arms and legs generally had the mass distribution of the seated Alderson F-50 dummy.

The tests of the jointed dummies, ARL-50, ARL VI-50, and Sierra 292-850, were run with the joints loose and tight as previously described. The wooden block could only be tested in the combined restraint since it had no articulation and had stubbed legs which would not prevent its escape from the lap belt, type 1. The tests were conducted in the NBS seat with a -5 deg seat pan angle using the same geometry as the human tests. Instrumentation coverage was identical to the human cover- age, with the obvious exception of the biomedical output. The number of runs was severely limited because of the costs of testing on the sophisticated Holloman facility. The data show only trends of performance and do not clearly define the absolute performance of the dummies. RESULTS - The data obtained from this series of tests appear in Table 6. The data are plotted in the series of graphs which follow. In each instance the number of data points for a given configuration, lap belt, type 1, or com- bined restraint, is limited. For visual comparison the data points are presented with the corresponding least squares fit lines from the human data compensated for variation in body weight. Figs. 43-45 define the performance of the ARL F-50 dummy. It must be remembered that this dummy weighs 7 °¡o more than the standard 50th percentile level and, there- fore, as a first approximation, the data should be reduced by this amount. Fig. 43 indicates lap belt loop loads versus g. It is not clear that there is any significant difference in the performance with different joint settings, that is, tight or loose, at the high g level. The data for loose joints using the combined restraint, Figs. 44 and 45, were obtained from earlier runs with a</page><page sequence="20">1042 R. W. ARMSTRONG AND H. P.

This does not alter the trend of the data to any discernable degree since tests of the ef- fect of seat pan angle on combined restraint loads indicate little variation with change in angle. It is apparent that the ARL F-50 dummy produces seat belt loads that are ap- proximately twice that which is indicated for humans. Figs. 46-48 are presentations of the performance of the Alderson VI-50 experimental dummy presently in produc- tion with only minor modifications to improve its durability. As in the previous graphs the data are compared with that for the adjusted 50th percentile male. The seat belt loads more closely approximate that obtained from humans. Figs. 49-51 are a similar presentation of the Sierra 292- 850 dummy. The load data for lap belt, type 1, perfor- mance approximate those of the human as does the lap belt, type 2. The torso, type 2, loads appear to be signif- icantly higher. Fig. 52 compares the lap belt, type 1, performance of the NBS sandbag with that of the human. The load perfor- mance is surprisingly similar. Unfortunately the sandbag was unable to withstand the jack-knifing over the lap belt in the 30 g test, and was split beyond repair.

Human (extrapolated) 4250 lb As the articulation of the body parts and pliability in the torso decreases the loads increase. (See Table 7.) Extensive additional tests were performed with the ARL VI-50 and Sierra 292-850 on the NBS sled because of their obvious superiority in simulating human seat belt loading and are reported on in Part II of this report. The authors are indebted to the Automotive Safety Re- search Office, Safety Engineering, Ford Motor Co. for the kinematic analysis of these two dummies taken from the high speed films at Holloman. These appear in the Ap- pendix. The method of presentation permits direct com- parison with the analysis of the human runs by General Motors. For example, the dummies' "H" points move for- ward more than the humans' "H" points. This is most likely due to the restraint of the legs by the human. Fig. 55 is a plot of the lap belt loads for humans, both lap belt, type 1, and the lap belt, type 2, versus g. Similar data from the ARL F -50 dummy are also plotted. There is a significant difference in the loading of seat belts of hu- mans and dummies. Note an approximate difference of 1000 lb. This is in part due to the muscular restraint in</page><page sequence="23">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1045 humans as previously discussed. The reference report on muscular restraint indicates that the leg preload of approxi- mately 300 lb and the effective mass of the lower legs, acting as part of the sled, account for the major portion of the variation; the remainder is judged to be a function of the degree of articulation, and pliability of the trunk of the dummy. EFFECT OF DECELERATION PULSE SHAPE ON SEAT BELT LOADS PURPOSE - In order to establish a procedure for dynamic compliance testing of seat belts, it must be established that the results of the tests are repeatable from laboratory to laboratory. One of the major difficulties that has been en- countered is to make a sufficiently uniform deceleration pulse on the various sleds that are in existence in the United States. In order to determine the effect of the deceleration pulse, it was necessary to experimentally establish what are the effects of change in g level, rate of onset of g, and veloc- ity at a constant g. These pulses are illustrated in Fig. 56. Theoretically the effects of these changes are known and have been discussed thoroughly in such publications as the ACIR "Analysis of the Dynamics of Automotive Passenger Restraint Systems Procedure" (3). To determine the effect of g and the effects of velocity, it was only necessary to extract appropriate data from tests conducted and tabu- lated in Table 1. Some of this data was established in production seats but it has been determined that the varia- tion due to the variables of the production seats, such as spring rate and so on, are second order effects compared to that of changing of the deceleration of the sled. In order to determine the effect of onset of g, it was necessary to skew the half sine pulse changing the point at which the pulse reaches a peak. This particular series of tests was run nom- inally at 15 g and at constant velocity. The seat belt loads were measured as in previous tests. The effect was docu- mented for both the lap belt only and for the combined restraint. RESULTS - The result of changing the level of decelera- tion g is clearly evident in Fig. 6 previously presented. The load level of the seat belts is generally proportionate to the g level if the time base remains nearly constant. The general effect of change in impact or initial ve- locity is documented in Fig. 57 for lap belt restraint, type 1, and in Fig. 58 for the type 2 restraints. The limited number of data points were taken from the first few runs listed in Table 1. It is clearly evident that an increase in velocity when a constant g level is maintained increases the load in the seat belt within the time durations approximating automobile crashes. This is as it should be, since there is more energy in the moving body to be dissipated and thus the load and the stretch of the seat belts must necessarily increase to accommodate it. The data obtained in the tests altering the rate of onset appear in Table 8.

The percentage increase is in excellent agree- ment with the theory as presented in the referenced AGIR publication. EFFECT OF VARYING ANGLES OF YAW ON SEAT BELT LOADS PURPOSE - In order to reduce the number of tests which would be required for dynamic compliance of seat belts, it is necessary to determine the yaw angle (side impact) or angles which would produce the greatest load in the seat belt. It is presumed that if one such angle of yaw (the angle the sled and seat makes with the direction of deceleration) could be found, then it would suffice for load level tests for all angles. It might still be necessary to conduct tests at some degree of yaw to determine the restraint's ability to contain the occupant. PROCEDURE - A series of tests were run at nominally 15 g varying the angle of yaw in increments of 30 deg to 90 deg in case of lap belt, type 1, installations. For the type 2 restraints the angles were varied from 0-90 deg and from 0 deg to 360 deg counterclockwise to 270 deg or -90 deg in order that the ARL F-50 dummy be thrown out of the torso restraint in one instance and into the torso re- straint in another. The conditions of test are the same as in the previous runs using the NBS seat with a -5 deg angle seat pan. RESULTS - Data obtained in this series of tests is listed in Table 9. Fig. 61 is a plot of the data obtained in the seat with lap belt, type 1. No data is listed for 270 deg to 70 deg yaw because of the symmetry of the lap belt, type 1.</page><page sequence="25">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1047 Table 9 Anchor- Entrance Angle ° of „ , ^ Condi- age 0 ° Lap ^ „ Belt , Upper ^ ^ Torso 0 Run g Velocity, Seat Pan, Lap ^ Belt Upper ^ Torso Yaw, tion of Width, No. Type of Run Level ft/sec deg Right Left Right Left deg Joints in.

Fig. 62 indicates the same general result for lap belts, type 2, with the possible exception of the load at +30 deg yaw. The torso force at 0 deg is equal to or exceeds those of other angles (Fig. 63). It is interesting to note that a significant load was taken in the torso restraint in decelera- tions at all angles of yaw. SEAT BELT PERFORMANCE WITH CHANGES IN VERTICAL ANGLE AND ANCHORAGE WIDTH OF LAP BELT PURPOSE - As previously indicated, dynamic testing of seat belts using the sled deceleration method is a relatively costly test procedure and the number of tests to validate the quality of a seat belt should be kept to a minimum. With this in mind, it is desirable to establish one geometric configuration in which to test the belt. This configuration should be based on two considerations: that which is most likely to be used, and that which develops the greatest load in the seat belt. The limited number of tests conducted attempted to determine whether there are any critical geo- metric considerations in the vertical angle of the lap belt. The vertical angle of the lap belt is defined as the "angle that the lap belt makes with the horizontal plane of the sled when viewed from the side." A few tests were run to determine whether there were any critical loads imposed on the lap belt by varying its width of anchorage through the range of 5-24 in. This range would appear to cover the majority of production seat belt installations. PROCEDURE - This series of tests was run in the NBS seat with -5 deg seat pan angle and lap belt, type 1 , and in the type 2 restraint using the ARL F-50 dummy. The first tests were conducted by changing the vertical angle from 20 deg to 70 deg with the deceleration of the sled at 15 g and 30 g. The second group of tests evaluating the anchorage width were conducted in the otherwise standard test condition and procedure at 15 g. co cos ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ o o O 4 O &lt;3 Û. §2 _J ° o I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 VERTICAL LAP BELT ANGLE (DEGREES) Fig. 64 - Seat belt performance, varying lap belt vertical angle, lap belt restraint only, NBS test seat, seat pan angle -5 deg, ARL dummy 175 lb, tight joints, half sine pulse, 15 g nominal RESULTS - The data obtained in the two series of tests appear in Table 10. Admittedly the number of tests with each geometric configuration is very limited and additional data was needed to clarify some of the results obtained. Such data was obtained in a series of tests conducted on the National Bureau of Standards sled (4) and reported in Part II of this report. Figs. 64-66 present the data taken at 15 g. Fig. 64 is a plot of the loop loads in the lap belt, type 1, versus verti- cal angle. Fig. 65 is a similar plot of the loads in the lap, type 2, and Fig. 66 is a plot of the loads of the torso, type 2. With the exception of one of two values for load in the lap, type 2, it would appear that the load obtained with a verti- cal lap belt angle of 45 deg is equivalent to or greater than those of 20 deg and 70 deg vertical angles. Figs. 67 and 68 present the loop loads of the lap and the torso, type 2, respectively under the standard test conditions at nominally 30 g. Fig. 67 indicates that the lap, type 2, at 70 deg ver- tical angle assumes a much greater load than the 45 deg angle.

There appears to be no significant difference in the loads obtained with the anchorage width varying from 5-24 in. Fig. 71 is similar data for the lap and torso, type 2, taken at 30 g. As before, there appears to be no significant varia- tion in the loads in the seat belt. It must be kept in mind that there is some possibility of generating some compressive force laterally to the pelvic region if the anchorages are too close together and are not of sufficient distance behind the "H" point. SUMMARY OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A series of 182 tests have been conducted on the Daisy Decelerator at the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. The data from these tests are presented in this report . They</page><page sequence="29">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1051 include tests on a variety of anthropomorphic dummies and on human subjects. By far the most important data is that from the 75 tests conducted on humans experiencing a simu- lated automotive crash using production seat belts in a man- ner in which the population normally wears the belt. The data documents the performance of 1965 production seats from the four major automobile companies. For a dynamic seat belt test based on the sled decelera- tion principle to be practical, it must test the seat belts at reasonable load levels in a minimum number of tests. The test must give repeatable results from one laboratory test sled to another. To achieve such a standard, many factors must be considered, including those that follow which were at least in part evaluated by the Holloman test series: 1. Seat Configuration - Considering the load imposed on the seat belt, it is possible to simulate the typical auto- mobile seat by adjusting the seat pan angle. This angle should be negative for simulation of 1965 production seats. 2. Degree of Dummy Articulation - The data show that the greater the articulation and pliability of the dummy's trunk, the lower the seat belt loads imposed by standard weight dummy (162-lb for 50th percentile male). All dum- mies to date, including the most sophisticated production units, produce seat belt loads exceeding that which might be expected for humans. 3. Impact Pulse Shape - The shape of the deceleration pulse must be carefully defined because variations in g, rate of onset and length of pulse or (velocity of simulated crash) can have extreme effects on the loads obtained in the seat belt. The least obvious of these factors is that at the same g level, the rate of onset of g can have an ap- preciable affect by merely shifting the peak of the pro- posed half sine wave 10-60 ms. The loads in the seat belt can vary as much as 150%. 4. Critical Angles of Impact - The data indicate that 0 deg of yaw, simulating a head-on crash, will satisfactorily impose maximum or near maximum loads in the seat belts. 5. Anchorage Locations - Limited data indicate that a geometry which includes a 45 deg vertical angle of the seat belt with the anchorages approximately 16 in. apart will impose loads nominally equal to or greater than other geometries that might be found in the production automobile. A great deal of additional data must be taken to verify these findings on the other sleds and to establish specific levels of performance at which the dynamic compliance tests should be run. PART H - TESTS AT NBS The importance of human tests and efforts to relate their performance to seats and seat belts as well as the rest of the restraint system, cannot be overemphasized. Part I of this report represents the major effort of the National Bureau of Standards in that endeavor. Because of the vast capability of the Daisy Decelerator with all the trained operating crew, electronics, medical and biological resources, this facility is not economical to operate when only a single parameter of the restraint system is to be studied. NBS does have, however, a dynamic sled (4) on which many appropriate tests of components of re- straint systems may be evaluated. By duplicating the pulse shape, seat, restraint and dummy used in the Daisy Decel- erator, many of the areas where limited data were taken can be properly extended. The cost of running a single test on the NBS sled is estimated at 1/5 0th of the cost of the Daisy Decelerator. The problems of restraint systems and the preparation of standards for their performance go well beyond the more glamorous work of dynamic testing of humans and dummies. It is important to know how well the industry is meeting present requirements, that is, if the state-of-the-art is being fully employed in the manufacture of seat belts to protect the public. Thus the Bureau samples the industry production. The sampling also allows the engineers and technologists of the Bureau an opportunity to test the laboratory proce- dures of the standards looking for ways to improve their reliability and streamline the test procedures. Used seat belts in limited numbers have been evaluated to indicate areas where such improvements in the standards are required. When looking at the overall picture of vehicle safety it would appear without question that more lives can be saved by increasing the usage of existing seat belts than by any other single safety measure. All the efforts in tire improvement, brakes, crashworthiness, lights, vision, gas tanks, and the rest cannot match the safety potential of the restraint system. It is not the object of the Bureau's program to sell seat belts but, within the mechanics of the device itself, to conduct research aimed at making the seat belt as convenient, comfortable, and easy to use as possible. It is the desire cf every researcher in this area to make the practical, readily accepted, passive restraint system that will afford all vehicle passengers the blessing of seat belts. Many related subjects need investigation and study: hu- man tolerance, improved anthropomorphic dummies, child restraints, systems of evaluating crashworthiness and so on, but limited budgets and priorities have not allowed full exploration of these important subjects. It is hoped that the following summaries of webbing abrasion tests, continuing NBS sled tests, and studies of anchorage locations in 1968 domestic automobiles con- ducted at NBS will serve to indicate the variety of scientific investigation that must be accomplished before the ultimate in life saving restraint systems is achieved. SLED TESTS PURPOSE - The tests to date of a continuing program of investigation of restraint system parameters have been conducted to produce data in the following areas of concern: 1. Performance Characteristics of the Two Most Human- like Anthropomorphic Dummies Commercially Available - These two dummies are the Alderson VT-50 and the Sierra Engineering Co. Model 292-850. The performance of these dummies on the NBS sled may be used to compare directly</page><page sequence="30">1052 R. W. ARMSTRONG AND H. P. WATERS Fig. 72 - NBS dynamic seat tester (Ref . 4) and augment the data of their performance obtained in a limited number of runs on the Daisy Decelera tor at Hollo - man Air Force Base. 2. Seat Pan Angle - Tests of production seats conducted at Holloman Air Force Base indicated that a more complete investigation of the effect of seat pan angle on the loads of seat belts should be made. These tests indicate how seat performance with seat belts may be improved and also help to determine the hard seat configuration to be established for dynamic sled compliance tests. 3. Lap Belt Angle - The angle between the lap belt and the horizontal plane from the side view affects the loop load of the lap belt and of the upper torso restraint. It also affects the forward displacement of the dummy. This data may be used to assist in two judgments: a better evaluation of the optimum lap belt angle, and the choice of a single angle of the lap belt for dynamic seat belt compliance tests. PROCEDURE - A photograph of the NBS Dynamic Seat Belt Tester showing the pertinent construction features appears in Fig. 72. The sled is an accelerator type, simu- lating the crash by accelerating from zero to the desired velocity. Its major power source is a heavy rotating fly- wheel with the acceleration pulse determined by the shape of a radial cam face upon which the tow belt wraps. The simulated deceleration pulse which was used in this series of tests is a half sine in shape. A stopping distance of 19 in. was used for all deceleration rates. The acceleration of the sled was recorded by two accelerometers of different frequency response. The seat belt loads were recorded using Lebow Model No. 3371 force transducers previously de- scribed in Part I of this report. The displacement of the seat belt and some portions of the dummy were measured with a positioh/displa cement transducer designed and built by the Transducer Controls Corp., Model No. TCC-Pt-101- 20A . These measurements, including the uniform velocity following the acceleration, were recorded on an oscillo- graph as time histories. Fig. 73 is a sample trace of an oscillograph trace. By using displacement devices, tests could be run without the need of the relatively expensive photometric analysis. The first series of tests on the influence of seat belt angle was made using two different geometries for the an- - RIGHT DIAG. LOWER - LEFT 01 AG.

This per- mits a determination of the effect of additional seat belt length as well as a change in angle. The second series of tests were conducted in a manner to serve two purposes: to closely tabulate the loading of the restraints with the two highly articulated dummies and to determine the effect of seat pan angle. Angles were changed in the seat pan from + 10 to -10 deg with the horizontal in increments of 5 deg. The tests were normally run at increments in the range of 18-31 g. RESULTS - Figs. 74 and 75 show the effect of seat belt angle on seat belt displacement for the lap belt and the combined restraint respectively. These tests were made with the Sierra 292-850 dummy using a seat pan angle of zero with the displacement transducer attached to the buckle of the lap belt, and with the sled operating at 23 g . It is obvious from the best estimate curves drawn through the data points that the displacement of the seat belt increases substantially with increased belt angle. This increased dis- placement is not desirable when it would allow the occupant of a vehicle to contact the internal structures of the vehicle.</page><page sequence="31">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1053 - ,4r c/&gt; LLI X O 12- Z / o / o / ° - / - o y -J8- ^ O 6- - s 2 4-^'"^ LU -I g 2 - o BEIT ANCHORAGE 12 INCHES BELOW HIP POINT 3 A BELT ANCHORAGE 6 INCHES BELOW HIP POINT CD 01 1 1 I I I I I 20 30 40 50 60 TO 80 90 LAP BELT ANGLE (DEGREES) Fig. 74 - Seat belt performance, varying lap belt anchorage position, combined restraint, NBS test seat, seat pan angle 0 deg, Sierra 292-850 dummy, half sine pulse, 19 in, stop- ping distance, sled deceleration 23 g 14 r co ÜJ ol2" 2 ¿10- CO p Û / -» 8" / č X O M 6 - / / M / / / X 4 - o -e UJ * 2- o 3 Cû ni i i i I I I I 20 30 40 50 60 70 B0 90 LAP BELT ANGLE (DEGREES) Fig. 75 - Seat belt performance, varying lap belt anchorage position, combined restraint, NBS test seat, seat pan angle 0 deg, Sierra 292-850 dummy, half sine pulse, 19 in. stop- ping distance, sled deceleration 23 g Fig. 76 indicates for the same series of tests the effect of lap belt angle on seat belt load for the lap belt, type 1. Here again, as in the Holloman tests, an increase in loop load occurs with increased belt angle. It is obvious that a reduction of loop belt load at any given g level of decel- eration is desirable. There is one other major factor that must be evaluated before what appears to be an obvious choice of small belt angles is made. The angle must not be made too small for the lap belt will easily slip up over the iliac crest of the pelvic structure and will impose lap co 35~ O o Jļ - 2*- g»-«,' - £L °/ gZ- /° 1 - o BELT ANCHORAGE 12 INCHES BELOW HIP POINT &amp; BELT ANCHORAGE 6 INCHES BELOW HIP POINT 01 I I I I I I I , 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 LAP BELT ANGLE (DEGREES) Fig. 76- Seat belt performance, varying lap belt anchorage position, lap belt restraint only, NBS test seat, seat pan angle 0 deg, Sierra 292-850 dummy, half sine pulse, 19 in. stopping distance, sled deceleration 23 g 7f- co / co 35- / / o _____ / __¿r g4- Q_ ° 2- o LAP BELT OF COMBINED RESTRAINT I - ô UPPER BELT OF COMBINED RESTRAINT □ LAP BELT ONLY Ol I I _J I I I I I - 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 DECELERATION (g) Fig. 77 - Seat belt performance, varying seat pan angle, combined restraint and lap belt restraint only, NBS test seat, seat pan angle +10 deg, Alderson VI-50 dummy, half sine pulse, 19 in. stopping distance belt loads into the soft abdominal region rather than on the pelvic structure.

This change- over is believed to occur because of the increased "sub- marining" of the dummy as the angle of the seat pan is made negative.

AVERAGE 1968 AUTOMOBILE DRIVER'S RESTRAINT ANCHORAGE LOCATIONS PURPOSE - Recent legislation has made the installation of upper torso restraints mandatory in several positions in the vehicle as well as lap belts for each designed passenger position. The present Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan- dard No. 210, which specifies anchorage locations, neces- sarily establishes these locations with very broad limitations in order that all 1968 automobiles would have legal and moderately satisfactory belt installation. Although some studies have been made in the past with regard to optimum achorage locations (6), the ideal locations have not been established. One way of determining satisfactory installa- tions would be to find the range of locations for the upper torso restraints and two lap belt anchorages and make dy- namic tests with appropriate anthropomorphic dummies at these extremes to determine any detrimental locations that presently exist. The results of such tests could be compared with those made at the average location that is used in the production automobiles manufactured in this country, based on production figures of each model. Such an average loca- tion could serve as the chosen location for dynamic seat belt tests under development. Further, in an effort to in- crease usage of seat belts, a selected human population could be exposed to the various geometries in a simulated</page><page sequence="35">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1057 UPPER TORSO ANCHORAGE DRIVER'S SEAT ('^ ' / INBOARD 7*1 ^ _ ANCHORAGE .....

Data was collected on the restraint geometry of all domestic auto- mobiles. PROCEDURE - The 358 different models of domestic automobiles manufactured in the United States necessarily had to be grouped in accordance to body style by every manufacturer to reduce a number of anchorage locations surveyed. An appropriate data sheet for taking measurements of vehicles was developed (Fig. 91). With elementary measur- ing tools the investigator, whose stature was very close to that of a 50th percentile male, and whose "H" point (nor- mally the point of rotation of the hip) was, for practical purposes, identical to the 50th percentile male, sat in and adjusted the seat to the middle range of its travel and, with the measuring device located the anchorage with respect to his "H" point. Some 53 vehicles were measured in this fashion. Appreciation must be expressed to the U. S. automotive manufacturers for measurement data and body style infor- mation which supplemented and materially reduced the work involved in obtaining anchorage locations. It was then necessary to attain data on production figures of U. S. automobiles to weigh the locations measured (7). RESULTS - A detailed report of the procedures, measure- ment techniques, data obtained, will appear in a report (8).

Samples were removed from late model vehicles and tensile tests were conducted on the abraded webbings with results shown in Table 13. Since these samples met the present hex bar abrasion test requirements of existing Federal and industrial stan- dards, it became obvious that a test must be developed that more accurately simulates the wear which occurs during the normal use of a seat belt. The development of a more representative abrasion test required changes in design of the test equipment and configuration as well as the control of many test parameters, such as humidity and resistance load which radically affect the rate of abrasion. Since seat belts are produced in such large quantities and a high degree of quality control must be maintained, considerable effort was directed to develop a test procedure</page><page sequence="37">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1059 SHORTENING STROKE ^ jQj ¿-hinge stop(E) kmim(A) M- 3 LB.

Approximately 600 different tests were conducted in order to set the requirements and test procedures of a spec- ification at a level which would assure the user that the product will be safe for a reasonable length of time. PROCEDURE - The tests were conducted on an abrasion tester designed and built at the National Bureau of Stan- dards (5). The special features of this device are a balanced loading method for testing six seat belts at one time. A humidity control chamber enclosing the device was added and the drum was used as an agitated source of the proper saturated salt solution for the desired humidity. Fig. 92 is an assembly drawing of the device (9). The combination of tester and humidity chamber make an effective econom- ical method of test. The following test parameters were selected or investi- gated in order to produce data that could be used directly to derive the requirements and test procedures for the spec- ification. 1. Atmospheric Conditions - 65 ± 2% R. H. and 70 ± 2F. Through general agreement between the ASTM Textile Committee, AATCC, and the U.S. Government, standard laboratory conditions were defined as those with 65 ± 2 °lo relative humidity and 70 ± 2 F. A series of tests was con- ducted to relate humidity and degree of abrasion in estab- lishing the percentage of strength retention. 2.

Cycle Method (a) The test configuration, as shown in Fig. 93, was designed to approximate an actual condition that may exist when a person adjusts the size of the assembly. This con- figuration was first suggested by General Motors laboratory personnel. (b) The 3 lb resistance load represents the tension to which a user may tighten his belt. Cycling tests, con- ducted to compare abrasion, in an actual adjustment to that of the simulated adjustment, show that the 3 lb resis- tance weight is necessary in order to produce an equivalent amount of abrasion wear in the accelerated test method. (c) The stroke length (6-8 in.) and cycle rate (18 ± 2 cycles /minute) were selected to minimize the time and material required to complete an abrasion test. Some heat is generated in the buckle during the process of cycling but tests conducted at rates of 10-30 cycles/minute indicate that the heat generated at 18 cycles /minute is negligible. (d) The number of cycles required was based partially on estimated usage figures chosen to represent at least two years of usage when the wearer adjusts the size of the as- sembly every time it is worn. Tests at various numbers of cycles were conducted to determine any unusual wear char- acteristics. A new webbing was fabricated by several manu- facturers and evaluated by the abrasion tester. RESULTS - Atmospheric Conditions - Fig. 94 is a plot of strength retention versus relative humidity after 2500 cycles of abra- sion on new webbing. The webbing was run through three production buckles of a design previously causing excessive wear. Tests indicate that at 65°Io R. H., which is standard</page><page sequence="38">1060 R. W.

Webbing normally used with these buckles would abrade until it was not possible to pull the webbing through the buckle after as few as 500 cycles. Retention would be down to the 25% region. Conditioning Time - The percent moisture regain plotted versus time in Fig. 95 is compiled by subtracting the original bone dry weight of a piece of webbing from the final weight after time in hours of exposure to 65% R. H. divided by the bone dry weight. As can be seen, there is little or no change in moisture regained after a conditioning period of 4 hr and that there is no significant difference whether the webbing was initially dry or at 90% R. H. Cycle Method - There is a definite indication from the tests conducted that if only slight abrasion has occurred at the end of 2500 cycles, the assembly will retain its strength for many more cycles. Fig. 96 shows that the increase in thickness occurs very rapidly when there is an abrasion problem, yet very slowly when in an efficient assembly. The graph also indicates the variation in abrasion with different types of buckles using the same webbing. As abrasion takes place, there is visible fraying of the fibers which causes webbing to increase in thickness. The increase in thickness is directly related to strength reduction as demonstrated in Fig. 97. The test parameters were established so that the tests could be com- pleted in a reasonable length of time, yet be of a sufficient number of cycles to detect an abrasion problem in the sys- tem. SUMMARY OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SLED TESTS - A series of sled tests have been conducted at the National Bureau of Standards supplementing limited data obtained at the Holloman Air Force Base which was reported on in Part I of this report.

The tests also indicate that the angle of the seat pan can vary the loads that are obtained in the lap belt only restraint configuration indicating, as was the case of the production automotive seats tested, that the negative seat pan angle increases the seat belt load. Further, if the lap belt angle, that is, the angle the lap belt makes with the</page><page sequence="39">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1061 horizontal, is increased, both the forward displacement of the seat belt and the dummy and the loop load of the belt increase. This data must not be used to establish desirable belt angles without consideration that the lower belt angles may very well cause the belt to slip from the pelvis into the abdominal region. Additional restraint parameters will be evaluated as this series of tests continues. RESTRAINT ANCHORAGE LOCATIONS - In an effort to establish geometric requirements for dynamic tests and for evaluation of seat belt anchorage locations for comfort and effectiveness, the variation in the anchorage locations for all 1968 domestic vehicles has been determined and average coordinate points for the anchorage locations for all 1968 vehicles has also been established. DEVELOPMENT OF AN ABRASION TEST - A series of over 600 tests have been conducted in order to establish recommendations for a more realistic buckle abrasion test. Upon completion of all the test data and analysis, the cycle method outlined was recommended for a new buckle abra- sion test with acceptable performance requirements as fol- lows: the requirement for the tensile strength of the webbing after abrasion under the established test conditions to be at least 75°/o of the strength before abrasion should assure a reasonable safe life expectancy of the assembly; each value of the webbing strength after abrasion should not be less than 4500 lb (75°/o of the minimum strength requirement for web- bing). CONCLUSIONS Since the data for defining each parameter of a proposed dynamic test for seat belts is limited in the Holloman test series, it is difficult at this time to draw specific conclu- sions. However, some impressions were gained as a result of the series of tests. As the result of these tests it would appear that it is not presently practical to construct a dummy to produce seat belt loads equivalent to humans. Furthermore, those which approach such performance are not durable enough to with- stand the repeated tests which would be required in a dy- namic compliance test program. The initial cost and up- keep of dummies approaching human performance dictates that special low cost, simplified dummies designed espe- cially to produce required seat belt loads must be developed. The dynamic tests also indicate that production auto- mobile seats induce in the belted subject submarining, re- bound and in some instances severing of seat belts. The seats collapse under very high vertical loading introduced by the loaded seat belt. Such collapse reduces the effec- tive forward restraint of the seat which might otherwise be expected to assist in restraining the subject's forward mo- tion. Therefore, it appears that the present production seat is inadequate for optimum use with seat belts and should be redesigned. Laboratory tests conducted indicate that a serious prob- lem exists in the abrasion of seat belts in the length ad- justment device generally found in the buckle. The test recommended virtually eliminates the problem and must be implemented to protect the lives of conscientious seat belt users. The survey of anchorage locations of 1968 seat belts indicates an extremely wide variation of locations, some of which appear from the standpoint of comfort and adverse angle of the lap belt to be undesirable. Much more restric- tive locations should be imposed which in some instances will require reappraisal of body configurations. REFERENCES 1. R. F. Chandler, "The Daisy Decelera tor," Tech. Doc.

WATERS APPENDIX A SUBJECT REPORTS RUN 3496 There was no apprehension. In fact, I was quite relaxed. Strapping was very loose, there were no pressure points. Body position was standard - sitting position with hands extended between legs. Acceleration was routine and un- eventful. At impact I could feel myself slide forward until lap belt was contacted. Asa result, the only discomfort was hitting the slack lap belt. I felt pain in the lower part of my abdomen and hip bones. My general post-run feel- ing was one of relief, but pain persisted for several hours post-impact. I would estimate I pulled about 15 g. The record showed 12.3 g. RUN 3497 I experienced very little apprehension during count- down. Strapping was safety belt with auto seat belt and diagonal shoulder strap. There were no pressure points. The shoulder strap was very loose. Acceleration was smooth and slow. At impact force was taken mostly on lap belt. The shoulder strap hit me about 4 in. below the clavicle on the pectoralis muscle. All the shoulder strap did was stop forward movement of the upper body; main impact was on the seat belt. I experienced no visual or respiratory difficulties at impact, no faintness or dizziness. I felt no pain during the 72 hr following impact associated with the ride. I pulled about 15 g. A very good ride. RUN 3498 Prerun apprehension exceeded the norm as this was my first Daisy run. Strapping was much looser than usual due to the type of ride. No pressure points were felt. Strapping was lap belt and chest belt. Body position was sitting erect, head held slightly back with chin somewhat tucked in. Arms were held straight down with hands clasped between the legs. Ride configuration was forward facing with a nor- mal tenseness in order to simulate impact occurring in an automobile accident. Occurrences during acceleration: firing occurred after a forty second countdown. During the acceleration, I opened my eyes and bit firmly on my mouthpiece. Acceleration was of a longer duration than I have experienced in the past. Firing was slow and smooth and the entire ride was without vibration or roughness. On impact several unusual experiences occurred. First, the force of impact was much greater than anticipated and bracing was not sufficient for the g forces experienced. Impact was of brief duration. As impact occurred I slid forward in the seat until stopped by the lap belt. Then forces loaded on the upper portion of the body and impact was localized on the chest and neck regions after reaching maximum forward motion and impacting into the chest belting. On impact there was brief disorientation; however, there was no blurring or double vision at any time. There was a "seeing of stars" experienced. There was no feeling of faintness or dizziness. There were several post-impact pains and sequelae. There were strap burns on the neck and chest regions that have scabbed and are still present at the end of 82 hr. For 48 hr or more, severe neck strain and pain was present. All other post-run feelings are re- markable. I would estimate that I pulled 17 g. RUN 3505 Apprehension was mild until the sled started down the track. Then it was moderate. The lap belt was not snug enough for me. I would have pulled it much tighter. There was no bandolier. I rode forward facing with hands clasped between my legs. I held my neck stiff and my legs pushing me against the back of the seat. Acceleration seemed nor- mal. Impact seemed quite abrupt. I felt my upper torso go forward and my arms go up. Immediately post-impact 1 felt pain in my lower right ribcage. This lasted for about 2 minutes, then a dull aching pain started and lasted 4 hr. It was sore and tender for 3 weeks; no other problems. Other than what was stated above, general post-run feeling was good. This ride was worse than I had anticipated. I think it was due mostly to the loose lap belt. RUN 3506 Quite a bit of apprehension prior to run. I had never seen a sled run prior to this day, and I had no chance to observe one before my run. Some shaking in the legs, but this may have been caused by body position. Apprehension was also increased by the fact that this was my first forward- facing run and I didn't know what to expect. Strapping was intentionally loose, with no pressure points. Body position was head up, eyes closed, neck tight, feet pushing up hard, hands clasped between my thighs, stomach muscles tight. I probably rode too tight. Acceleration was slow and didn't seem to start until well after the countdown had ended. Very smooth. Impact was smooth, but as strapping was loose my body (especially hips) slid forward and rammed against the belts. This was especially noticeable against the hips. No disorientation, difficulty with breathing, or feeling of faintness or dizziness. Some pain over the hip bones, es- pecially the left, where a bruise developed and lasted for a few days. Soreness in neck beginning about 3 hr after impact and lasting two days. A patch of hemorrhaged tiny blood vessels under strapping area on left side of chest, but little pain associated with it. Not much of any kind of post-run feeling. The ride was good and I seemed to pull fewer g than my two previous bobber rides of 12 g, even though this one was 15 g.</page><page sequence="41">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1063 RUN 3507 Strapping was only on the lap. Strapping on this run seemed a little loose as compared to the way I strap myself in my car. I sat in the sled almost the way a person would sit in a car. I tried to stay fairly relaxed during the whole ride. At impact the pressure was increased on my hip bone, and it seemed as though my body was sliding forward, yet it was not painful. I had no difficulty breathing at any time. No faintness or dizziness, and no pain at impact. I felt relieved after the run. I think I pulled around 15 g. RUN 3508 Slight apprehension during strapping procedure. This was my first ride in the National Bureau of Standards seat belt tests, but not my first forward facing ride. Strapping across hips and bandolier across the chest were very loose compared to previous sled rides. I held my head erect (no head support present) with my arms held out straight and clasped between legs. Acceleration was smooth and very slow compared to other rides. At impact I felt a slight pain below right breast and throughout right arm. Cause of this pain seemed due to the diagonal chest strap which seemed to lift at impact. Pain or strain subsided after 30 minutes. No stunning or blurred vision at impact. No diffi- culty with breathing at any time. No faintness or dizziness at any time. Despite extensive effort of Dr. Sonntag and a Land Air contractor to keep green shirt from sliding down beneath strap across left shoulder, a slight bruise was evident after impact. Bruise disappeared by the following morning. Immediately post impact I felt relaxed and ready to ride again. I think I pulled about 20 g. A seemingly new blood pressure cuff was used for this ride. I have two bruises on upper left arm where cuff was positioned. Ride was good but I do not recommend it for new sled subjects since the unusually loose belt gives one a feeling of insecurity . RUN 3513 The strapping for this run was purposely left relatively loose. The strapping consisted of a lap belt and a bandolier which ran across my upper body from the left shoulder to the right hip. My body was erect with my hands clasped between my knees. The acceleration was very smooth. At impact, my arms flew up and my head snapped forward. There was little pain at impact, although I did feel consider- able pressure on my left shoulder from the bandolier. There was only minor redness of the skin in the area of the left shoulder from the bandolier. I felt almost no pressure at all from the lap belt, although the post run data from sixain gauges indicated that I had exerted 900 lb of pressure on the lap belt at impact. The lap belt was relatively high on my waist and not down around the hip bones. From pre- vious sled rides, I have learned that the impact is less pain- ful if the lap belt rides slightly high on the lower abdomen. At the time of impact, there was no neck pain, but the next day I experienced considerable soreness in the muscles in the back of my neck. I feel that this was due to my upper body being stopped by the bandolier, while my head con- tinued forward for a short distance at impact. It would seem that neck injuries of this sort will occur more fre- quently with the bandolier arrangement than would occur with only the lap belt. However, from previous "lap belt only" rides on the bopper, I would say that the addition of the bandolier makes for an overall less painful impact. There was no disorientation at impact and I experienced no postrun headache. The impact was 15 g. RUN 3514 I feel that my health status was excellent prior to my run. Strapping was tighter on this run, as compared to the previous run. I felt a little more secure in the seat. I held my head back, and my back erect as if I were riding in an automobile. I tried to think of something else while I was on the sled. I find by doing this that I can really relax. At impact the pressure was increased on my hip bone from the belt, but it did not seem to be as much as the previous days ride. It seemed to be a much better ride, and I thought that I pulled less g than the previous day's ride, but I pulled more g on this ride. I think that this was due to the strapping and relaxing a little more. I found myself at impact; I let all of my breath out. This is also referred to as a Ke-i in Judo. I was not really aware of this until I practiced it on a few rides. I do feel more comfortable when I am strapped in with a 3 in. lap belt, as compared with the 2 in. belt. To me, the 2 in. seems to slide down a little on impact. I held my breath a little after impact, but I felt no pain. I really felt relieved. I really don't know how many g I pulled. My comments on strapping are: I feel that people do strap down a little bit tighter than I was strapped on Run 3507. And, I prefer the 3 in. lap belt. I really liked this particular ride. RUN 3515 Three days before the ride I suffered from viral gastro- enteritis. I returned to work the day before the ride but was still somewhat weak. By the day of the ride I felt much better and essentially back to normal. I had very mild apprehension until I was being strapped into the seat. Once I realized how loosely I was being strapped, both lap belt and bandolier, I was quite apprehen- sive and somewhat dreaded the ride. As mentioned above, the strapping was looser than on previous rides, and the lap belt would allow at least an inch forward movement of my buttocks. The bandolier would also allow my torso to move 2-3 in. forward. My position was forward, buttocks against the seat, both feet against the footrest, trunk upright in a position similar to normal driving position. My head was held up with some tightening of the neck muscles. My arms were extended toward my feet at about a 45 deg angle to the horizontal.</page><page sequence="42">1064 R. W. ARMSTRONG AND H. P. WATERS Acceleration was smooth. During acceleration I held my legs tensed against the foo trest, my buttocks against the seat, and my neck muscles tensed with my head upright. At impact my trunk was thrown forward until restrained by the bandolier. Immediately when my chest hit the ban- dolier I had a forced expiration. As I recall, I made an audible grunting noise with the expiration at impact. I experienced no visual aberrations during or after im- pact. I had no difficulty breathing except that the ban- dolier knocked the wind out of me at impact. I had no dizziness or faintness. At impact I didn't appreciate any pain, but very shortly thereafter I was aware of pain bilaterally below the an- terior superior iliac spines, where the belt restrained my forward movement. The day of the ride I noticed only slight discomfort where the lap belt rubbed. Also there were small bilateral bruises at these points. The day after the ride my neck was quite sore and stiff. It was just muscular soreness but involved almost all muscles of the neck. I had no discom- fort from the area where the bandolier crossed the body. Immediately after impact I felt fine, relieved, and slightly sore where the lap belt hit my body. I pulled 17 g. RUN 3516 Health prior to the run was excellent. There was more than the usual amount of apprehension for this ride. This was the first Daisy since January 1966, and if that wasn't enough, the knowledge that loose straps, a loose riding position, and 15 g forward were intended jetted the phys- iology skyward, and increased the butterfly count fourfold. I sat forward facing, head erect, arms extended and down, and hands clasped between my legs. As per instruc- tions, there was slight tension on the feet, almost none in the hands, and the neck was kept slightly rigid. Acceleration was slow and smooth. The ride seemed to last four or five seconds from the firing command. Im- pact was abrupt but not sharp. Most of the load was taken evenly across the body at a line 2-1/2-3 in. below the navel. Pressure was felt on the left side of the neck caused by the bandolier strap riding up sometime before or at im- pact. Neither impact area was painful, although the pres- sure across the body was strong. At no time at or after impact were feelings of dizziness, faintness, or nausea ex- perienced. Vision did not seem to blur. For all the apprehension before the ride, it turned out to be rather mild. As a suggestion to the personnel in- terested in the tests, a briefing to experienced riders prior to the run of areas of concern would probably yield better post information than the single debriefing alone. RUN 3517 I was in good health prior to the ride. There was little or no apprehension before this ride. Body positioning was very uncomfortable and the strapping was a little tighter than on the previous ride. I felt a little more secure since the straps were tighter. This ride was supposed to have been 15 g and I was re- quested to ride relaxed. I was relaxed at acceleration and just before impact I seemed to have tensed my legs. At impact there was pain across the ilium on both sides. Com- pared to the previous ride, the lap belt was riding too high on me or the belt wasn't as thick as the previous belt. The pain only lasted for a few seconds. There was no difficulty with breathing or vision. Post-run there were no problems. RUN 3518 Health prior to run was excellent. Apprehension: little or none as I was sure it would be an easy ride. Strapping: comfortable and not extremely tight. Body position: seated erect, simulating auto seating position. Acceleration: smooth as usual (for the Daisy). Impact: felt body pitch forward. Disoriented: not at all, was instructed to ride re- laxed, believe I did so. Pain: felt lap belt strike across abdomen, no winded feeling as in previous ride. (Perhaps belt was placed slightly lower.) Post impact: felt fine, believe this was the most relaxed and most enjoyable ride yet. Pulled between 10 and 15 g.</page><page sequence="43">RESEARCH ON RESTRAINT SYSTEMS 1065 APPENDIX B PHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF HUMAN RUNS BY GENERAL MOTORS *-10 loch«* ^ ^ Fig. B-l - Human kinematics, Holloman Daisy sled 3486, 7.2 g max, plywood seat cushion 5 deg down, seat back 12 deg rear, lap restraint, 5 ft 10 in. 145 lb male 1 iSv X''V ♦10 inches-» &gt; N.
