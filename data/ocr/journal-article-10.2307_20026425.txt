<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contemporary Science and the Contemporary World View Philipp Frank From some quarters the suggestion has been made to stop research in science for a time, because it threatens to bring about eventually the destruction of mankind. One is told one should rather devote more effort to work in the field of the humanities. The hope is that in this way ethics and religion wil^develop to a level at which they are able to adapt the human mind to the threat of contemporary science. There are, of course, old myths according to which mankind was once forced to a moratorium on scientific research. Chapter eleven in Genesis tells us that the children of men had made great advances in mechanical engineering. By introducing brick and mortar construction they built a great city. "And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said ' Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.' So the Lord scat tered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city." Scientific research had to stop for a time and the children of Adam had to turn to the humanities: they had to study languages. We can learn from this biblical story that there has been an old tradition according to which exaggerated scientific and technolog ical advance is dangerous for mankind and a direct intervention of God had to produce a moratorium on research. In our century the work in science has evidently recovered so well that we now can hear quite a few voices calling for a new Babylonic confusion. It has been said again and again that there is an exaggerated emphasis on science in our educational system which produces un desirable effects in the personalities of our students. Many edu cators ? and every grownup claims to be an educator ? have made</page><page sequence="2">58 Dcedalus the point that the neglect of the humanistic studies is responsible for the general decline in spiritual values and, perhaps, in human values in general. The mind of educators manifests itself in the most conspicuous way in commencement speeches, and there we fre quently hear the assertion that this state of affairs leads to an emphasis on ' facts ' at the cost of values. However, a poet and humanist like Archibald MacLeish regards this objection as superficial. His own objection to science as the main topic of education is rather that science deals too little with facts and concentrates on abstractions. "This sort of thing has consequences," writes MacLeish in the Atlantic Monthly (March, 1956). "Abstractions have a limiting, a dehumanizing, a dehydrat ing effect on the relation to things of the man who must live with them. The result is that we are more and more left, in our scientific society, without the means of knowledge of ourselves as we truly are or of our experience as it actually is." According to MacLeish, science gives us only abstractions of the world; we do not learn what our world really is. " Science can ab stract ideas about apples from apples . . . but poetry does not abstract. Poetry presents the thing as the thing . . . the true child of abstraction can't know apple as apple . . . you can't know man as man. All you can knotv is a world dissolved by analyzing intellect into abstraction ? not a world composed by imaginative intellect into itself." We can find similar ideas in the discussion by literary men of the difference between the general world picture of the sciences and the humanities. Thus Aldous Huxley writes in his little book Sci ence, Liberty and Peace (New York, 1946), that the scientists and their followers tend to accept the world picture which is implicit in the theories of science as a complete and exhaustive account of reality. Huxley insists that "the scientific picture of the world is inadequate for the simple reason that science does not even profess to deal with experience as a whole, but only with certain aspects of it in certain contexts." He contrasts the few abstractions of which science consists with "the infinitely rich totality of given facts." For these reasons, students who are brought up in merely scientific thinking will know only a poor and dry, geometrical and mechanical skeleton of the world. They will feel helpless if ex posed to the full reality of the world.</page><page sequence="3">Contemporary Science and World View 59 Other authors, viewing science as a dehumanized abstraction, conclude that science cannot have any influence on philosophy as a world view which determines our way of life. Evidently this guidance should be left completely to irrational sources of knowl edge, for example religion, metaphysics and, implicitly, political philosophy. But, in fact, this " dehumanizing " and " dehydrating " influence of science has had at all times an important impact upon man's ideas of his place in the universe and, therefore, upon his general philosophy of Ufe. This impact is established by empirical observation with the same certainty as any empirical fact of human or natural history. The ancient conflict between Epicurean material ism and Platonic idealism had its basis in the scientific conflict between the hypothesis that the earth and celestial bodies (sun and stars) are all made of the same material and the ancient belief that terrestrial and celestial materials are fundamentally different. New ton established a theory of the universe according to which the celestial bodies (including comets) move by the same laws as stones and projectiles that are launched by man; and the Newton ian philosophy was the basis of Jefferson's democratic ideas. In our century, the theory of relativity has been interpreted frequently as favoring idealistic philosophy because physics no longer speaks about the " real length of a body " but about its " length for an individual observer." This is taken to mean that physical science deals with mental phenomena instead of with material objects. In a similar way, in quantum theory the physicist does not describe the objective position or the objective orbits of particles, but the measurements made by observers under certain circumstances. Both theories seem to oppose the mechanistic and materialistic philos ophies of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and to favor a mentalistic picture of the world. As a matter of fact, the view that science is the product of abstrac tion from our rich and full experience is rather misleading. It has become more and more clear by the evolution of science in our century that the principles of science are not dehydrated abstrac tions but a system of symbols that is produced by the creative imagination of the scientist. This has been nowhere demonstrated as clearly as in Einstein's Herbert Spencer Lectures (given at Ox ford, 1933) on the Logical Foundations of Theoretical Physics. There is no process of abstraction by which we can proceed from</page><page sequence="4">6o Dcedalus our experience with moving bodies to Newton's laws of motion or to Einstein's equations of motion in a gravitational field as they are advanced by the general theory of relativity. While our experi ences of motion can be described in common-sense language, the general principles (like Newton's or Einstein's laws of motion) contain symbols like " curved four-dimensional space " or " length relative to a system F " which do not belong to the common-sense language which we use for the description of our daily life experi ence. In the same way, the principles of quantum theory contain words like " probability of a particle to be at a certain place " or " ^-function of a certain field of force " which are not to be found in our common-sense language. The connection between the general principles (like the equa tions of motion in the general theory of relativity) and the common sense level consists in the following: from the general principles we can derive, by long mathematical chains, statements which describe directly observable facts and which can, therefore, be formulated in a common-sense language. Einstein stresses the point that the advance in science is connected with an increasing remote ness of the general principles from statements of our common-sense language. As a matter of fact, even the statements of Newtonian physics cannot really be formulated in common-sense language, but in the relativity and quantum theories the impossibility becomes obvious. The more remote the language of the principles is from common sense language, the longer becomes the mathematical chain that connects these principles with the statements which describe the actually observable phenomena by which the theory is checked. Sometimes the chains are without precise end. We must not forget that these chains do not consist of mathematical deductions only. We would never arrive at a statement that could be checked by actual physical operations unless the chain contained at some place operational definitions by which a connection between the symbols at the top and the measurements at the bottom was established. In theories like the quantum theory, the presentation of operational definitions becomes a difficult and controversial task. One cannot wonder that there has always been an urge to connect the principles with common-sense language by some shorter and more direct way. There has been a longing to restore the situation in which the general principles themselves are congruent to common</page><page sequence="5">Contemporary Science and World View 61 sense. Today we have the impression that Aristotelian and Thomistic physics had this property. The attempts to give direct common sense interpretation to the principles of relativity theory and quan tum theory have played a considerable role in our time. Thus the expression " length relative to a certain system of reference " has frequently been replaced by "length relative to an individual observer " who was even occasionally referred to as " Peter " or " Paul." According to the theory of relativity there is an influence of motion upon yardsticks. Hence, every description of a length measurement has to contain the speed of the yardstick. But by referring to " length " as the sense impression of " Peter " or " Paul " the dependence of length upon the system of reference becomes a dependence upon the mental state of " Peter " or " Paul." This is the short circuit by which the expression " length with respect to a system of reference " becomes an expression of common-sense language; but now it asserts that there is an influence of optical sensation upon the mental state of "Peter" or "Paul." As soon as we replace the expressions that occur in the theory of relativity by these anthropomorphic common-sense terms, the physical theory becomes a kind of psychological theory. From this common sense interpretation the result is derived that physics actually speaks about the mental phenomena of individuals. Then it is quite natural to interpret modern science in favor of an idealistic or skeptical world view and to deny that science can provide knowledge about physical reality. In a similar way, in quantum theory, the impossibility of introducing position and velocity of a particle at a certain instant of time as state variables has also been interpreted by statements in common-sense language ? by a " short circuit," without the long chain that leads to observable phenomena. In one such interpretation the position and velocity of a particle at the same instant of time are said to be inaccessible to the re search abilities of human beings, and according to another interpreta tion, these quantities are actually not strictly determined but vague. If we use the common-sense meaning of the terms employed, this can only mean that the world itself is something vague and can be investigated, not by the methods of science, which are striving for precise and logical results, but by methods used in investigating the " irrational " and " spontaneous " aspects of the world: by meta physics, religion, mysticism. So some have seen in modern physics a possibility of reconciling science with religion and metaphysics.</page><page sequence="6">62 Dcedalus From the scientific viewpoint it is impossible to interpret the principles of quantum theory in common-sense language, except by deriving from them observable conclusions; " short circuits " between the principles of quantum theory or relativity theory and common-sense language are within scientific discourse, strictly speaking, impossible. Regardless of how great the effort in this direction is, the results achieved are always vague and, to a high degree, arbitrary. This means, of course, only that they are " logi cally arbitrary "; they cannot be derived with certainty by logical operations. But "arbitrary" does not mean that these common-sense interpretations are the result of our " free choice." The choice is, as a matter of fact, determined by our " values," and our predilection for a certain philosophy of life, since different common-sense interpretations could and would support different philosophies of life. A familiar example is given by the Einstein theory, according to which a mass can be " converted " into an energy. This conversion of mass is, in the common-sense language, a " disappearance " of mass or a " dematerialization," and it would imply not physics but magic and the occult. In advancing the theory, the physicist does not use " mass " as a word of the common-sense language. If forced to introduce common-sense language, he would have to say either that energy is mass and one kind of mass is converted into another kind of mass, or else that mass is basically energy and that there is no " mass " in the common-sense meaning of the word. The first interpretation would favor materialism, the second idealism or spirit ualism. Contemporary Soviet philosophers have frequently written in favor of the first interpretation, holding that the other would be antagonistic to the political philosophy supported by the govern ment and the ruling party. In the opposite camp, many attempts to " refute materialism " have invoked the second interpretation, which abolished matter. The introduction of common-sense language where it does not belong has also played a role in domains far removed from physics. If we introduce into theology expressions like " almightiness of God," or "goodness of God," they lead certainly to contradic tions, just as the introduction of "position and velocity of a particle at the same moment " leads to contradictions in atomic physics. Obviously all such expressions denoting qualities of God are terms of our common-sense language. To avoid such</page><page sequence="7">Contemporary Science and World View 63 terms in theology the notion of a " God without qualities " has been introduced ? an example of the attempt to cast the principles of theology in a language other than our common-sense language. But this so-called " negative theology " and other such doctrines always have to fight against infiltration by common-sense expressions; and hitherto no language has found the general accept ance in theology as, for example, the symbolism of quantum theory has in physics. If we want to understand the impact of twentieth-century sci ence upon man's general world picture, we have to consider the popular assertion or hope that twentieth-century science may be easier to reconcile with religion and ethics than was the case in the eighteenth or nineteenth century. As a matter of fact, all these attempts at reconciliation have been attempts to produce a short circuit from science to theology analogous to the attempted short circuit from the principles of quantum theory to indeterminism and free will. Briefly, the hope for reconciliation has not been based upon science, but upon the vague interpretations of scientific prin ciples by the introduction of common-sense language. The British philosopher Broad wrote once that there has been only one plausible argument for supporting traditional religion by science: the existence of scientific laws which are " simple " com pared with the immense multitude of " facts " that can be derived from them. A priori, it is not self-evident or even plausible that such laws should exist; but science has found that they do exist. The belief that nature is ruled in every respect by a few such laws is the content of what Einstein called " cosmic religion." But Ein stein always maintained that for this argument it does not make any difference whether those laws are Newton's laws of mechancs or the laws of relativistic physics or the laws of quantum theory provided that these laws are helpful in comprehending nature by permitting the derivation of a multitude of facts from simple principles. Whatever the laws are, they give, in this parlance, testimony of God's presence in the universe. I believe that the advances in philosophy which have been stim ulated by twentieth-century physics, like relativity and quantum theory, are not advances in metaphysics but advances in semantics. Twentieth-century science has taught us that the fundamental</page><page sequence="8">64 Dcedalus vocabulary for formulating the principles of science can and may have to be very different from our common-sense language, and that, as a consequence, a long chain of difficult arguments is nec essary in order to draw testable conclusions from these general principles. We learn from twentieth-century science that the main advances of science depend not only on the discovery of new facts but on the invention of a new language that can connect these facts with simple principles. We remember the scriptural admonition "Do not pour new wine in old bottles." Einstein used to say that what interested him in the liberation of nuclear energy was not its military or peaceful utilizations but the fact that the fundamental law for these energy-liberating reactions can be logically derived from the principle of relativity. In the same vein, P. W. Bridgman pointed out in the essay " The Prospect for Intelligence " (Yale Review, 1945) that the impact of twentieth-century physics upon human values is twofold. Firstly, the new discoveries in the realm of very small and very large distances and masses have certainly had a great influence upon man's estimation of his position in the universe. "However," writes Bridgman, "the second aspect of the modern epoch in science is, I believe, of incomparably greater significance. The new facts have proved to be so deeply at variance with what had been conceived to be the possible order of nature that the physicist has had to dig down into an analysis of the fundamental tenets of thinking, and has to revise his entire conceptual structure." This revision, required by the circumstance that the vocabulary used in the principles of science is so remote from our common sense language, is apparent on reading almost any book on the general principles of quantum theory. Long passages are devoted to clearing up the relations between the technological expressions and our common-sense language. For example, in quantum theory the term " particle " is employed as a thing which has no precise position and velocity, and so is clearly incompatible with the full common-sense meaning of this word. I once asked Niels Bohr whether it would not be practical to eliminate the term " particle " completely from quantum theory. Bohr agreed that one could do so in the interest of unambiguity. But our intuitive thinking in me chanics is strongly tied to the concept of a particle. What we use in quantum theory has some properties of the common-sense par ticle, but not all of them. As a conceptual tool this " quasi-particle "</page><page sequence="9">Contemporary Science and World View 65 is helpful because we can use some of our common-sense judgments about its motion; it is stimulating for the thinking of the physicist, particularly the experimental physicist. This is why the concept remains in the theory, despite its patent dangers. Bridgman rightly makes the point that in our discourse on religion, politics or ethics, we are speaking continually in terms which we may or may not be using in their common-sense mean ing. There is no doubt that political or religious discourse on general questions uses freely terms like " freedom," " democracy," " well-being of the community," etc., which are not actually to be taken in their common-sense meaning. Bridgman thinks that a clear separation between the different levels of meaning in our political or religious discourse would destroy much of the mis understanding which makes human relations difficult. What we can learn from contemporary science for our general world view is the technique of analyzing the meaning of terms. This analysis is inseparable from doctrines like quantum theory. Without a precise formulation of the operational meaning of terms it would be im possible to draw conclusions from these principles about observable facts. Specifically, Bridgman has stressed that the application of this technique would reveal a great many questions put by philos ophy and theology to be as meaningless as speculations concern ing the absolute speed of the earth or the precise position and momentum of a particle. At the end, I return to the assertion of MacLeish that science gives only abstractions while poetry presents "reality." This dis tinction is well analyzed by Richard von Mises in his book, Positivism, an Essay in Human Understanding (Harvard Univer sity Press, 1951). We have seen that the main activity of science does not consist in producing abstractions from experience. It con sists in the invention of symbols and in the building of a symbolic system from which our experience can be logically derived. This system is the work of creative imagination which acts on the basis of our experience. The work of the scientist is probably not funda mentally different from the work of the poet. "Reality in its fullness " can be grasped neither by the scientist nor by the poet. Reality can only be experienced, never presented; we cannot even know what it would mean to present " reality." Every presenta tion, scientific or poetic, proceeds by creating symbols. If we ask</page><page sequence="10">66 Dcedalus which of them comes closer to reality, we employ the word " real ity " again in a twilight region where it is not clear whether the word is used in its common-sense meaning or not. If somebody would claim to present the "full reality," I would question modestly, "Really?" I sense that some people may say: "You have spoken only about words; we should prefer to hear about facts." However, science and all other types of knowledge, including art, consist in build ing up systems of symbols; words are merely one kind of symbol. Non-scientists often believe that science consists in making observa tions, in accumulating experience. But this image misses the point. At every moment of our Ufe we perceive data of experience, yet by recording them we do not get science. Science begins only when we invent a system of symbols which can bring order into our experience. For building up science, the creation of words and their syntax is as important as experiments. A part of our science is contained in the vocabulary and the syntax of the English, French or German that we use. And this is a province of the philosophy of science; for, as L. Wittgenstein put it in the book Philosophical Investigations (London, 1954): " One might give the name ' philos ophy ' to what is possible before all new discoveries and inventions."</page></plain_text>
