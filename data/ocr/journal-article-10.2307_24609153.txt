<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF THE TEMPLE SCROLL(*) That there is a specific character to the section at the end of the Temple Temple Scroll which we term the Deuteronomic Paraphrase was already clear to the first editor of the Scroll, Y. Yadin. In discussing the "Formulation of the Text in the First Person," Yadin referred to the "Extended Quotations from Deut. xii xxiii:l" in 11QT 53-58 and 60-66. In these texts, Yadin noted, the "author" (his term) consistently changed from the third person designation of God to the first, except where syntactic difficulties prevented him from doing so. He notes that the author made such changes in the text of Deuteronomy while retaining the original formulation of the commands of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. (I) The notion that this Deuteronomic section ought to be regarded as a source and that the Temple Scroll was actually a composite work was put forward by A. M. Wilson and L. Wills in 1982.(2) They delineated this source as including 11QT 51,11 56,21 and 60,1-66,17. The interruption was constituted by the section usually termed the Law of the King which was described by them as "laws of polity."

I am indebted to the staff of the institute and to my colleagues for their help and advice. Translations of the Temple Scroll are mine, except in one case where noted. (1) Y.

SHIFFMAN 544 More recently, this matter has received thorough study in the dissertation by M. 0. Wise.(4) His view of the scope of this source is quite different. He sees it as including 11QT 2,1-15, 48,48, l-10a, 51,11-18, 52,1-12, 53,1-56,21, 60,12-63,148, 64, l-6a, 13b-66,9b and 66,10-12a. (5) He argues further that the author of the scroll did not work directly from Deuteronomy but rather from an intermediate document. Regarding the last part, that parallel to the Deuteronomic source isolated by Wilson and Wills, he sees the interpolated passages as part of a second source he calls "the Midrash to Deuteronomy." This source he understands to contain 57,1-59,21 (the Law of the King), 60:2-11, and 64:6b 13a. Extremely important is his claim that these additions to the Deuteronomic section are drawn from a single, distinct source. (6) This paper will examine the distinctly Deuteronomic material at the end of the scroll, attempting to explain how this section was adapted into the Temple Scroll and how it relates to the canonical Deuteronomy.Deuteronomy. Specifically we shall want to know the following: (1) What is the extent of this literary unit? (2) Was it a version of the book of Deuteronomy or some otherwise reworked Deuteronomic or Pentateuchal document? (3) How did the author or redactor of the Temple Scroll use this material? What did he excise, add or replace? (4) What presuppositions or legal tradi tions lay behind such adaptations and reworkings on his part? (5) How are the minor variations to be accounted for? Are they textual matters or do they relate to the peculiar legal views of the scroll? (6) Ought we extend the scope of this source to include earlier material from the scroll (as does Wise)? (7) Finally, what purpose does the document or source we will have reconstructed and studied play in the overall literary plan and creation of the Temple Temple Scroll? To address this question some overall concept of the structure of the Temple Scroll is necessary. It must be understood that the Temple Temple Scroll is by no means just a compilation of biblical excerpts from texts showing textual variations with MT. Rather, the scroll represents a complete reediting and recasting of the canonical Torah. The scroll begins with the commandment to build a Temple adapted from the Tabernacle texts in Ex. 28. From there the scroll proceeds through the Temple plan, turning at intervals to the sacrifices and purity laws relevant to the various Temple (4) The Temple Scroll: Its Composilion, Dale, Purpose and Provenance (Chicago: University of Chicago Dissertation, 1988).

In this context the author dealt with such topics as the Festival Calendar and laws of purity, perhaps already available to him as sources. After completing the section on the purity of the Temple, he then presented the Deuteronomic Paraphrase. This section he composed himself, placing within it the Law of the King which was available to him. His purpose in writing the Paraphrase was to conclude his text with Deuteronomy.Deuteronomy. (7) Accordingly, the author clearly intended to present an entire Torah in which he presented his views on the ideal Temple, sacrificial and purity laws, political system, and numerous other topics of Jewish law. It was the purpose of the author/redactor to cast his plan for the revision of Jewish society, worship and law as the Torah revealed by God to the Jewish people. He therefore adapted and reedited (or better: re-redacted) the Torah so as to present a unified formulation of the principles of law which he espoused. To do this he gathered together diverse materials on a single subject and recast them as a single whole. In this process he often relied on midrashic exegesis to resolve apparent contradictions in the Pentateuch. It is this pattern of harmonization and reediting which we seek to isolate here. Extent and Character of the Paraphrase We shall begin with a working definition of this section of the scroll which will allow us to describe its contents, and eventually to delineate its scope. We define this Paraphrase as the sections of the Temple Scroll which follow the order of Deuteronomy and in which the Deuteronomic text serves as the basic text for the legal exposition of the scroll. Further, we refer to a block of text in which several sections of Deuteronomy appear in the same order as they do in the canonical book. After all, the presumption here is of a Paraphrase which follows the order of Scripture, not simply of a law or laws based on Deuteronomy. It is for this reason that we cannot accept the additional sections proposed by Wise as part of the Paraphrase. They simply do not have Deuteronomy as their basic text. HQT 2,1-15 is based on Ex. 34,10-16 and the Deuteronomic material is used to supplement it. 11QT 48, l-10a is a harmonization of Lev. 11,13-25 and Deut. 14,1-3.11-21, yet Leviticus 11 provides the basic form of (7) It may be that the author did his work hastily. For this reason, the second half of the Paraphrase tends to have the greatest number of passages closest to the canonical Deuteronomy.</page><page sequence="4">L. H. SHIFFMAN 546 the passage and Deuteronomy 14 serves to supplement. Yet, his claim that a separate midrashic source was before the author must be given serious consideration in light of the arguments he has presented. (8) The material in the latter part of the Temple Scroll can be classified into at least seven categories, in regard to relationship to the canonical book of Deuteronomy. Indeeed, most passages in the scroll exhibit a combination of such characteristics. First, some of the material constitues verbatim repetition of Deuteronomy, with only orthographic or linguistic variations. Second, there is material which in addition exhibits minor variations attributable to textual history. Many of these variants are known to us from the ancient versions. Third, some differences result from the harmonizing tendencies of the redactor of the scroll or his Vorlage.(Vorlage.(Vorlage.(9) Fourth, some sections include also modifications of exegetical character, designed to eliminate inconsistencies or ambiguities in the Deuteronomic text. A fifth group also involves variants of a «halakhic» character, intentionally introduced, we think, by the redactor of the scroll. Sixth, there are sections in which midrashic interpretations, some intended to harmonize entire biblical passages, are introduced by the scroll which was throughout concerned with bringing together and homogenizing if necessary various Pentateuchal commands on a given subject. Seventh, and finally, there are additions of original character, designed to supplement the Torah with laws not found in the canonical text of Deuteronomy. (10) In what follows we will present examples of these phenomena. These examples are drawn from a complete study of the Paraphrase which we have conducted. In most cases, examples illustrate a combination of several of these aspects. For clarity of both method and exposition, this study begins with texts agreeing closely to the Masoretic Text of Deuteronomy and proceeds to passages which diverge more extensively, finally discussing a (8) Wise. pp. 150-62. (9) We speak here of harmonizations on the level of words or phrases. Harmonizations of entire passages are a form of midrashic exegesis. See E. Tov, "The Nature and Background of Harmonizations in Biblical Manuscripts," Journal Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 31 (1985), 3-29. (10) See Yadin I, pp. 73-82; S. A.

To begin with, it is important to indicate the nature of the start of the Paraphrase, although we must admit the obscurity of its conclusion at the end of the scroll. After the section regarding the impurity of the dead (11) the scroll turns to the conclusion of the section of purity laws. Such conclusions occur at the end of various sections of the scroll. 11QT 51,5-10 constitutes such a conclusion, taking up the perorative themes of the revelation at Sinai and the dwelling of God among the people of Israel.(12) There then appears an open space (petuhah). At this point the scroll addresses the appointment of judges beginning with Deut.Deut.Deut. 17,18.(13) Yadin's comments already raise questions about where this paraphrase ought to begin. He notes that the scroll had already dealt with Deut. 14,1-21 elsewhere and that 12,22f. on tithes was already dealt with, and that it and 15 and 16 were skipped because entire sections of the scroll had been devoted to these topics already. (14) This analysis tends to support our view that the author/redactor of the Temple Scroll composed the paraphrase. (15) For this reason he included only those aspects of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy which had not been dealt with already. (16) Had the Paraphrase been in existence before, it would be hard to explain why it in no way overlapped with the rest of the scroll. We shall now outline the basic organization and character of the Paraphrase as a whole: Beginning in 11QT 51,11 the scroll follows Deut. 16, starting with verse 18. After considerable reshaping of verses 21 and 22, the text continues directly with Deut. 17,1. 17,1. Thereafter, the scroll turns to Deut. 15,19-23 starting in 11QT 11QT 52,7. It next quotes Deut. 25,4 and then 22,10. From there the scroll moves to Deut. 12,6-7 which is not directly quoted (11) On these laws, see L. H. Schiffman, "The Impurity of the Dead in the Temple Scroll," Archaeology and History in the Dead Sea Scrolls, ed. L. H. Schiffman (Sheffield, JSOT Press for ASOR, 1990), 135-56. (12) Cf. 11QT 29,7-10. (13) Note that none of the requirements for judges discussed in CD 10,4-10 are even hinted at here. Cf. L. H.

Schiffman, "The King, his Guard and the Royal Council in the Temple Temple Scroti," Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research 54 (1987), 238f. (16) Noteworthy is the omission from the Temple Scroll of the passages of the Shema',Shema', Deul. 6,4-9; 11,13-21 and Num. 15,37-41, and the Ten Commandments, Deul. 4,6-18 and Ex. 20,1-14.</page><page sequence="6">L. H. SHIFKMAN 548 but which serves as the basis for the author's composition. From 11QT 11QT 11QT 53,19 the scroll continues to follow Deut. 12 loosely, primarily based on verses 15-19. Thence, the text turns to Deut, 12,20-26, then diverging to include extensive material on oaths and vows from Num. 30,3-17. In 54,8 the text returns again to Deuterono my my 13. It follows Deut. 13,2-19 closely, then moving because of the subject matter back to chapter 17. From 55,15 the scroll addresses Deut. 17,2-20. Verses 14-20 of Deuteronomy 17 are the Law of the King which led the author to insert so much original material, most probably from a préexistent source. When the author/redactor concluded this section, beginning in 60,1-5 he addressed priestly emoluments, essentially an exegesis of Deut. 18,1-5 and continuing into 18 to verse 22. Starting in 11QT 61,6, he then followed Deut. 19,15-21,21. Deut. 21,22-23 is extensively reworked and interpreted in 11QT 64,6-13. The text then continues directly with Deut. 22 in its entirety. Deut. 23,1 serves for the scroll as an occasion to turn to Leviticus 18 and 20 from which it derives laws of consanguineous marriages. The scroll ends soon thereafter, and we do not know if the Deuteronomic paraphrase should, therefore, be considered as ending in 66,12 or if it may have continued further on. (17) The chart which follows presents a tabular survey of the Paraphrase: Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 11QT 11QT 11QT 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 51,11-18 51,51,19-52:3 52,3-5 52.6-7 52.7-12 52.12 52.13 52,13-21 53,07-8 53,9-10 XX XX XX XX(19)XX(19) 53,11-54:7 (17) From the literary point of view, the transition to Leviticus here can be seen as analogous to the turn to Numbers 30 in 11QT 53,14 and, therefore, need not mean that the Paraphrase has come to an end. On the other hand, the following column, 67, was certainly intended to close the scroll. See Yadin II, pp. 300f. (18) Secondary reference. The first half of the law is quoted from Lev. 22,28.

In what follows, we shall attempt to illustrate these relationships, showing also how the various characteristics we discussed above operate together. To be sure, it would seem that a study such as this must make reference to two additional bodies of Qumran material: the manuscripts of Deuteronomy and the so-called "expanded Torah scrolls," 4Q364, 365, 366 and 367. A number of Deuteronomy (20) This section, the Law of the King, contains extensive composition by the author of the Paraphrase. (21) There follow commands from Leu. 18 and 20 with which the preserved scroll ends.</page><page sequence="8">L. H. SHIFFMAN 550 manuscripts have been edited by S. A. White. (22) These manus cripts demonstrate the state of the Deuteronomic text at Qumran, and evidence the same kind of variations with MT as are found in the textual base, that is the Vorlage, used by the author of the Temple Temple Scroll's Deuteronomic Paraphrase. Such variations in the Temple Temple Scroll were studied in detail by E. Tov.(23) On the other hand, the aggregate of readings in these texts does not allow us to assume any specific relationships, or for that matter recensions which could be dependent on one another. Our study of the Deuteronomy Deuteronomy manuscripts edited by White indicates that in many cases the Deuteronomic texts available to 11QT were not the same as those in the manuscripts found at Qumran. Although few passages found in the manuscripts she published are reflected in the present paper, there is ample material elsewhere in the Paraphrase to require a thorough study of the relationship of her manuscripts to the Deuteronomic substratum of the Paraphrase. As regards the expanded Torah scrolls, I am indebted to Professors J. Strugnell and Emanuel Tov for permission to examine not only the photographss of these "para-biblical" texts but also their preliminary transcriptions and notes. These manu scripts represent texts of the Pentateuch with textual variations with MT and harmonistic and exegetical tendencies, similar to those observed in the first few examples from the Deuteronomic Paraphrase to be examined below. A few extended additions are found in these manuscripts, most of which are in a style similar to that of the Temple Scroll and some of which have been seen by Yadin as part of the scroll. (24) Yet unfortunately, there are not preserved in these manuscripts any passages from those sections of Deuteronomy which served as the basis of the Deuteronomic Paraphrase at the end of the Temple Scroll. We ought to briefly mention a possibility which had to be considered from the methodological point of view. The assertion that the Paraphrase is dependent on the canonical Deuteronomy is not the only possibility. For this reason, we took into account the possibility that the canonical Deuteronomy could theoretically be seen as adapted from a version of Deuteronomy which would have looked something like our Paraphrase. This possibility was then (22) She was kind enough to allow me access to her edition, A Critical Edition of of Seven Manuscripts of Deuteronomy: 4QDta, 4QDI', 4QDtd, 4QDtf, 4QD19, 4QDt', and 4QDI",4QDI", Cambridge: Harvard University Dissertation, 1988.

The result of this test was abject failure. There simply is no way in which the reverse of the process we are studying in this paper could have occurred. It is impossible to explain the development in any other sequence than that we have proposed. The canonical Deuteronomy with textual variations lay before our author/redactor when he composed the Paraphrase. It preceded the Temple Scroll chronolo gically beyond any shadow of a doubt. In what follows we present a series of examples selected only after a study of the entire Paraphrase: 1. 1. Verbatim Paraphrase The largest number of verbatim paraphrases occurs in the section of the Deuteronomic Paraphrase after the Law of the King, i.e. in 11QT 60,2-66:12. An example of almost exact correspon dence is 11QT 65,2-5 and Deut. 22,6-7: (25) [2] [I]f you happ[en to come upon] a bird's [nest], while on your way, in any tree or on the ground, [3] (with) young birds or eggs, [4] and the mother (bird) is sitting on the young birds or eggs, you may not take the mother together with the children. (26) You must send forth the mother (bird) and [5] (only then) may you take the children for yourself, in [or]der that it may go well with you (27) and that you may live long. (28) This passage is virtually identical with MT. It exhibits only the following variations: orthographic variation, including the second person pronominal suffix and plene and defective spelling of certain words, addition of 'et to verse 6 ('et ha-'em). Otherwise, this is a verbatim quotation. The variations with MT can be accounted for by the history of transmission and the history of the Hebrew language. There is no evidence of any conscious changes here on the part of the scroll's author/redactor or of his Vorlage. In such a case we see the scroll as simply quoting Deuteronomy. (29) (25) Cf. Brin, pp. 204f. (26) I.e. either the eggs or young birds. (27) E. Qimron, "New readings in the Temple Scroll," IEJ 28 (1978), 169f. argues convinvingly for the reading yytv rather than ywtw as read by Yadin (II, p. 238). His view is adopted by Tov, pp. 102 and 104 in two other passages. (28) Part of Deul. 22,6-7 is preserved in 4QDI', Fragments 3-5, published in White, pp. 249-52. This fragment is orthographically and linguistically much closer to MT than to 11QT. (29) Cf. J. Maier, The Temple Scroll, An Introduction, Translation and Commentary,Commentary, trans. R. White (Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1985), pp. 134f. who sees the placements of this law as indicating that the author of the scroll saw this prohibition as "designed to maintain the usefulness of the birds for fellow Israelites." Yet the context in 11QT is clearly dictated here by Deuteronomy 22.</page><page sequence="10">L. H. SHIFFMAN 552 2. Verbatim Paraphrase with Variation A second type of verbatim quotation which occurs in the Paraphrase involves the inclusion of a passage in a manner at variance with MT. This is the case with 11QT 65,5-7 which corresponds to Deut. 22,8: [5] When you build a new house, [6] you must construct a parapet (railing) for its roof, so that blood-guilt not be brought upon your house if someone falls [7] from it. In addition to the usual orthographic variations, this text exhibits one and possibly two significant textual variants. MT's le-gagekha, "for your roof," is replaced here by le-gago, "for its roof," i.e. the roof of the house. This reading seems to correspond somewhat to the LXX, "for your house" fto domati sou).(30) If the reading of Yadin is accepted, the replacement of MT tsym with tswm would be such a variant, although it is probable that the scroll should be read here in accord with MT. In any case, this passage seems to exhibit variation with MT which is not the result of interpretative activity by our author or his source. Rather, these variations result from the nature of the text of Deuteronomy which was before him. In such passages it is clear that the author intended to quote Deuteronomy,Deuteronomy, except that he did so in accord with a version somewhat different from MT. We must remember, then, that in passages in which the redactor has introduced intentional changes to the text, there still may be a substratum of textual variants which were in evidence in the author's Deuteronomy text. Even in verbatim, or almost verbatim quotations, the placement of the passage in the scroll can also be significant. This is the case with 11QT 52,13 which deals with the prohibition on plowing with diverse animals of Deut. 22,10: (31) [13] And you may not plow with an ox and a donkey (yoked) together. This verse is in fact repeated verbatim, with the only change the addition at the beginning of the verse of the conjunction, "and," common in the scroll's reworking of biblical texts. (32) (30) LXX appears to agree with Sifre Devarim 229 (ed. L. Finkelstein [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1969], p. 261). (31) Cf. Brin, p. 208. (32) See, e.g., 11QT 52,3 (last word) and Deul. 17,1. Although this variation is not noted by Yadin, see his commentary, II, p. 232, which indicates that the scribe must have added the vav intentionally in order to connect this law to be preceeding.</page><page sequence="11">553 THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF X1QT The author has taken the law about plowing with diverse animals out of its context, in connection with diverse plantings (Deut.(Deut. 22,9) and clothing (22,11), which appear in 11QT 65,05 07,(33) and connected it with the laws regarding animals which appear in 11QT 52,4-53,8.(34) The moving of Deut. 22,10 to a position in the Temple Scroll immediately after Deut. 25,4 (the prohibition on muzzling of animals which appears in 11QT 52,12) was designed most probably to indicate the author's view regarding the significance of this restriction. He took the view that the prohibition on plowing with an ox and a donkey related not to the violation of the order of nature, as he thought the prohibitions on sowing diverse kinds or wearing clothes of linen and wool did, but rather to the requirement of preventing the suffering of animals. (35) In this case, then, the positioning of a Deuteronomic law in the scroll says much about the author's view of it, although its text is in virtually complete agreement with MT. 3. Harmonization 11QT 11QT 11QT 52,3-5 follows Deut. 17,11: [4] And you shall [5] not sacrifice to Me an ox or a sheep in which there is any serious blemish, for they are an abomination [6] to Me. (36) The addition of the conjunction waw, not found in MT, at the beginning of this text is probably not an actual variant. We have already noted that such additional conjunctive vavs are common in the Temple Scroll and represent the work of the author/redactor. The replacement of the third person for God with the first is the usual pattern in this text. Harmonistic tendencies were certainly at work in the author's change of MT 'asher yiheyeh bo mum kol davar ra' to 'asher yiheyeh bo bo kol mum ra'. The author was influenced by kol mum ra' in Deut. 15,21.(37) Here the efforts were clearly directed at removing the potential ambiguity of MT. As it stands it is not clear from MT that the mum and davar ra' are one and the same. Indeed, tannaitic exegesis used davar ra' to widen considerably the prohibition beyond actual blemishes. (38) Our text here is not (33) According to the restoration of Y ad in II, p. 292. (34) Yadin II, p. 234. (35) In this respect he agreed with those taking the view that abstention from cruelty to animals was required by the Torah. Cf. B. Bava' Mes'ia' 31a-33a. (36) This translation follows Yadin II, pp. 232-3 exactly. (37)(37) Yadin II, p. 232 also compares Lev. 22,20-21 which does not seem to us to have any direct influence on our passage.

SHIFFMAN 554 simply harmonizing but rather clarifies the law that the prohibition concerns only a serious blemish, but no other davar. This text is an example of the type of law in this paraphrase in which the text virtually follows the MT except for minor modification of language to eliminate ambiguity. We do not deal here with true textual variants. In this case, harmonization was effected for exegetical reasons. 4. Exegetical Variations 11QT 11QT 54,8-18 is essentially a quotation of Deut. 13,2-6 but it exhibits textual transmissional variations, harmonizations and exegeses as well: (39) [8] If there shall arise among you a prophet or a dreamer (or: seer) who had (previously) given you a sign or [9] wonder and this sign or wonder had come to pass for you, and he shall say: [10] "Let us go and worship other gods" which you had not known, do not [11] listen (40) to the word of that prophet or to that dreamer. For [12] I am testing you to determine whether you love the Lord, [13] the God of Your fathers, with all your heart and with all your soul. You should follow (lit. walk after) the Lord [14] Your God and worship (only) Him, and revere (only) Him, obey His voice [15] and cleave to Him. (41) And that prophet or dreamer must be put to death because he spoke rebelliously [16] against the Lord your God Who took you out of the land of Egypt, and I have redeemed you [17] from the house of bondage, to push you aside from the way in which I commanded you to walk (go). In this way shall you purge [18] the evil from among you. For MT ki 11QT has 'im, a modernizing linguistic variation known from elsewhere. (42) In line 9 the scroll adds 'elekhah. (43) It is difficult to understand any reason for this plus but in light of the (39) Parts of this passage are preserved in lQDeuleronomy (first exemplar), published in D. Barthélémy, J. T. Milik, Qumran Cave I, Discoveries in the Judaean Desert 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), Fragments 7 and 8, p. 55. Comparisons with this manuscript are found in the notes below. On this passage in the scroll, cf. Brin, pp. 21 If. (40) So MT, and Samaritan. lQDeulLXX and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan have the plural. (41) Cf. 4QDtc, Fragment 20 in which parts of Deul. 13,5-6 appear, published in White, pp. 60f. Note that this MS has tlkwn which agrees with 11QT as opposed to MT tlkw. The same reading is found in lQDeul". Where MT and 11QT, have tdbkwn.tdbkwn. lQDeul" has a word ending in what appears to be a resh, leading the editors to restore [t£m]r. It is not clear why they restored a defective form. (42) See 11QT 55,2. Brin, pp. 214-217 argues that this is a linguistic modernization on the part of the author, but Yadin II, p. 247 rejects this view. (43) Omitted in the translation in Yadin II, pp. 244 and 399. lQDeul" does not have this addition.</page><page sequence="13">555 THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF XIQT occurrence of this word further on in the verse this seems not to be a genuine textual variant but an expansion on the part of the scroll or a Vorlage. The substitution in 11QT of ha-'ot 'o hamofet (the 'alef of '0 is a correction suspended above the line) for MT ha-'ot we-ha-mofet is both harmonizing (with verse 2) and exegetical, since it clarifies that the Torah intends either a sign or a miracle, not both together. In the latter part of verse 3 the scroll has moved we na'ovdemna'ovdem from the end of the verse to the direct discourse of the idolatrous prophet. This is to remove the ambiguity of MT regarding what the prophet said. In MT it seems that he would have stated the entire verse 3b (from nelekhah). The 11QT version makes clear that the words 'asher 10' yedalem are not to be included in the direct discourse of the false prophet. Accordingly, this is an exegetical change made intentially by the author or his Vorlage.Vorlage. Further, this constitutes a harmonization with Deut. 13,14, a similar verse. (44) 11QT 11QT devar for MT divre in verse 4 may be a genuine variant as may be 11QT la-holem for MT 'el holem, although this difference may also be the result of sloppiness. Spelling menasseh with sin rather than samekh is simply a linguistic variation. (45) In line 12 11QT switches from the third to the first person, as is usual, but in 13 it preserves the third person usage of the biblical text with the substitution of 'elohe 'avotekhemah for MT 'elohekhem. This may be a variant but may also be influenced by Ex. 3,16. (46) In verse 5 the scroll switched the order of some of the clauses and deleted, perhaps by mistake, the reference to observing the commandments. The omission by the scroll of the second ha-hu' in verse 6 must be an error since it is required to make sense there. In line 16 'elohekhah appears in the scroll for plural, 'elohekhem in MT to verse 6. The reading in the scroll of 'asher hosi'akhah for MT ha-mosi' etkhem is designed to avoid the ambiguity of the participle which is replaced by the past, again an exegetical variation. Note also the shift from plural object in MT to singular in 11QT. In these cases of the shift from plural to singular the scroll agrees with LXX and the Samaritan. In this case, it is probable that the variations were in the author's Deuteronomy text. These changes seem to be intended to eliminate the awkward shift in MT with ha-podekha(47) to the singular object from the plural. Our scroll, (44) Deut. 13,14 appears in 11QT 55,4. (45) For other examples see Yadin II, p. 244. (46)(46) Yadin II, p. 244. (47) So also lQDeul״, wh[pwdkh].</page><page sequence="14">L. H. SHIFFMAN 556 like the LXX and the Samaritan, has smoothed this out. But the scroll also shifts here to the first person creating a more glaring awkwardness. At the end of verse 10 there is another shift from the third person to the first. In this passage, there seems to be evidence of genuine textual variants which, however, are of minor contextual significance. At the same time, several harmonizations and exegetical variations or changes to eliminate ambiguity have been introduced into the text. In some of these cases, the LXX and Samaritan shared the same traditions. 5. Halakhic Variation 11QT 11QT 55,2-14 generally follows Deut. 13,13-19: [2] If you hear regarding on[e of your cities which] I give you [in which] to dwe[ll], [3] the following: (48) "Some worthless] peo[p]le among you have gone out and have led astray (pushed away) all the [inhabitants of [4] their city, saying, 'Let us go and worship gods' which you have not known," [5] then you must ask, inquire and investigate carefully. (49) If the accusation turns out to be true and correct, [6] (and) this abominable thing has been done (or: abominable transgression has been committed) in Israel, you must kill all the inhabitants of [7] that city by the sword, destroying(50) it and all (the people) that are in it. And [8] all its domesticated animals (51) you must kill by the sword. Then you must gather all the spoil (taken) from it into [9] its town square and burn the city and the spoil (taken) from it which fire as a whole burnt offering to the Lord [10] your God. It shall be an eternal mound (tel) never to be rebuilt. None of the property to be destroyed should remain [11] in your hand (possession). (You shall do all this (52)) in order that I shall turn (be appeased) from My anger and show you [12] mercy, and have compassion on you and increase you as I promised to your forefathers, [13] provided that you obey My voice to observe all My command ments which I command you [14] this day so as to do what is right and good before the Lord your God. The scroll substitutes 'im for MT ki as part of its "modernizing" tendency twice, in lines 2 and 13. Further, the text in general (48) This is the meaning of le'mor in this context. (49) Helev here modifies all three verbs, not only the first as in Yadin's translation (II, pp. 247-401). (50) Taking haharem as an infinitive absolute used in the gerundive sense, rather than as an imperative. (51) I.e. permissible, edible animals. (52) This clause applies not simply to the avoidance of the herein, as in Yadin's translation (II, p. 248), but rather this section (verses 18b-19) applies to the entire procedure outlined in Deul. 13,13-19.</page><page sequence="15">557 THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF XIQT switches to the first person, as usual, preserving however the third person in lines 9-10 and 14. Interesting is the shift in the meaning of the first person in Deut. 13,19 from Moses to God in the scroll. This shift in meaning results from the change in context occasioned by the move to first person direct, divine discourse. 11QT 11QT adds kol indicating that all the inhabitants must worship idols (line 3) and again that all the inhabitants be killed (line 6). This is clearly a halakhic modification and in both cases agrees with the LXX. In line 8 the scroll even adds kol again to say that all animals must be destroyed. (53) But the parallel with LXX proves that these changes can have taken place in the Vorlage of the author, and may not be original to him. (54) The omission in 11QT of 'aherim from verse 14 is no doubt an error in our text. In 11QT the order of verbs is S'l, drS, hqr, whereas in MT it is dr§, hqr, §'l. this is most likely an editorial change designed to place the steps in investigation in the order of intensity, in which "asking" is clearly an earlier stage than detailed investigation. The occurrence of be-yisra'el in 11QT for MT be qirbekhaqirbekha may be simply a contamination or harmonization based on Deut.Deut. 17,4.(55) It is certainly not a midrashic variation, as no attempt is made by our scroll to make any analogy between the idolatrous city and the idolatrous individual of Deut. 17,2-7 the laws of which will follow immediately in the Temple Scroll. The addition of takkeh in line 8(56) seems intended to increase clarity, but this variation can simply be a textual variant. The addition of the preposition le- to tel seems to be explanatory. Substitution of the root dbr for MT sb' in the nif 'al can be a case of synonymous variance (57) and may be a textual variant in the author's Vorlage. 11QT we-hatov which is not in MT but which is found in LXX and Samaritan seems to be a harmonizing variation influenced by Deut. 6,18 and 12,28. It may have already appeared in the author's Vorlage. 11QT lifne for MT be-'enebe-'ene may be a move away from anthropomorphism. The very same variation exists in 11QT 53,8. (58) In any case this does seem to be an exegetical variation. (53) LXX omits we-'el behemto left herev. (54)(54) Yadin II, p. 247 suggests influence of Gen. 18,24-25. (55) Yadin II, p. 248. (56) Not noted by Yadin. (57) Maier, p. 122 suggests that it may be an attempt to avoid anthropomorphism. J. Milgrom, "Further Studies in the Temple Scroll," Jewish Quarterly Quarterly Review N.S. 71 (1980-81), 100 notes, however, that these usages are synonymous in Deuteronomy itself. (58) So Brin, pp. 218-20. Contrast Yadin II, p. 238 who suggests that this change was effected to introduce tifne 'adonai because it is more common in sacrificial context.</page><page sequence="16">L. H. SHIFFMAN 558 While this passage shows the types of variations we have observed above, it also contains changes introduced by the author, or readings adopted by him, to indicate specific Jewish legal rulings. This is what we mean when we refer to halakhic variations. Further, this and the following examples involve a variety of types of modifications of the biblical text which combine to express the scroll's particular views. 6. Midrashic Interpretation 11QT 11QT 53,07-8, dealing with non-sacral slaughter, is parallel to Deut.Deut. 12,20-25. This passage evidences midrashic exegesis as well as the characteristics we have already observed in the previous examples: [07] [When I enlarge your territory [1] as I promised you, and if the place which I have chosen there to place My name is too fa]r[ from you, [2] and you say, "I should (like to) eat meat," for you] desire to eat m[eat, [3] you may] eat as much m[eat as you desire. You may] slaughter] any of your sheep and goats or cattle, according to My blessing which I will give [4] to you. You shall (or: must) eat it in your gates, (it may be eaten by both) the pure and impure among you together (or: alike), as though it were a gazelle [5] or a hart. Only be certain (lit. strong) that you not eat the blood. You must spill it on the ground like water and you must cover it [6] with dirt. (59) For the blood is the life-essence, and you may not eat the life-essence with the meat. (All this you must do) in order that [7] it should be good for you (60) and for your children after you for ever. For you shall do what is right and good [8] before Me; I am the Lord your God. On the surface, this passage looks like a simple quotation, with only minor variations, but matters are far more complex. First, the author must have changed to the first person in the restored sections. It is most likely that the text gathered together kiki yarhiv... and ki yirhaq... (Deut. 12,20 and 21) into one opening sentence. This again seems to be the result of secondary editorial activity, and does not represent any biblical Vorlage. As restored, the scroll seems to have had perfect 'iwwtah for MT imperfect te' awweh. This is an example of linguistic moderniza tion to the norms of post-biblical tense usage. 11QT mi-sonakhah (59) Hebrew 'afar is "dirt, soil, dust, earth." M. Hullin 6:7 lists those substances regarded as 'afar by the tannaim for the purpose of fulfiling this commandment. (60) See above, n. 27. On this entire passage see now E. Tov, "Deut. 12 and UQTempleUQTemple LII-LIII. A Contrastive Analysis", Fie vue de Qumrân 15 (Mémorial Jean Starcky 1991), 169-173.</page><page sequence="17">THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF XIQT 559 u-miveqarekhahu-miveqarekhah represents two changes, a reversal of the order of the words and the replacement of a plural form in the case of baqarbaqar for the outdated MT singular collective. Perhaps, sonakhah here should be vocalized as the plural, sonekhah. Regarding the order, the switch can be either the result of a genuine variant or of sloppiness on the part of the author. Such reversals have been observed to be typical of quoted texts. (61) There is in any case no exegetical relevance to this variation. At this point the scroll introduces a midrashic harmonization with verse 15(62). From verse 21 the author gets the command to slaughter the sheep and goats, and the cattle, with the reversal of word order we have just noted. He then turns to verse 15 for ke virkativirkati 'asher 'etten lekhah which is an adaptation of the words of Deuteronomy ke-virkat 'adonai 'elohekha 'asher natan lekha with the change from third to first person. The scroll, however, changes from the past tense to the future. The transition from verse 21 to verse 15 is aided by the presence of 'asher nalan... lekha in both verses. This common element provides the transition back to verse 21 from which our text takes we-'akhalta bi she'arekhah.she'arekhah. Then the author makes a combination of the end of verse 22 and verse 15. First, he presents the "pure" and "impure," reversing the order in both verses in MT. This is probably simply a synonymous variation or sloppiness. The addition of bekhah to verse 22 is attested in LXX and Samaritan and was probably in the author's Vorlage. Yahdaw comes from verse 22 while yokhelenu is common to both passages, and it serves as the transition back to verse 15 for ka-sevi we-kha 'at/a/. (63) Note that some uncecessary clauses were omitted from the version of our scroll. Otherwise, the combined text would have been awkward. The omission of these phrases again testifies to the operation of a purposeful editorial process here, not just random textual variation. We will see below that this harmoniza tion served the author's halakhic purposes. It was not simply an attempt to eliminate the duplication of language which appears to be present in Deuteronomy 12. There then follows the beginning of verse 23, raq hazaq levilli 'akhol'akhol ha-dam, then the end of verse 24, 'al ha-'ares tishpekkenu ka mayyim. The words we-khissito be-'afar are then added based on (61) M. Zeidel, "Maqbilot ben Sefer Yeshaya' Le-Sefer Tehillim," Sinai 38 (1955), 150. For reversals which indicate later dating, see A. Hurvitz, '"Kiasmus Diaqroni' Be-'Ivrit Ha-Miqra'it," Ha-Miqra Ve-Toledol Yisra'el, Mehqarim Le-Zikhro shelshel Y. Liver, ed. B. Uffenheimer (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1971/2), 248-55.

This addition is clearly an halakhic one. The rite of covering the blood, called kissui ha-dam in Rabbinic literature, was understood by the Rabbis to apply only to the blood of undomesticated animals (hayyot) and fowl ('ofot),(&amp;4) in accord with Lev. 17,13. Our scroll understands this law to apply as well to domesticated animals (behemot).(65) The reason for spilling (and in the author's view covering) the blood is now quoted from verse 23, ki ha-dam hu' ha-nefesh we-lo' to'khalto'khal ha-nefesh 'im ha-basar. (The addition of 'et before ha-nefesh in the scroll may reflect a variant text but is probably a correction by the author of a text like MT which omitted it.). The rearrangement of the order is also a halakhic variation, intended to emphasize the purpose of the commandment of spilling and covering the blood. Further, this revision of verses 23-24 brings them into harmony with verse 16.(66) The scroll concludes with an adaptation of the blessing in the second part of verse 28 (le-ma'an...). Here several changes occurred. The expression 'ad 'olam was added under the influence of verse 28, either a case of harmonization or of true textual variation in the Vorlage, which, however, may have been itself a result of harmonization. Finally, at the end, be-'ene 'adonai is replaced by lefanay 'ani 'adonai 'elohekhah. This involves both the change from the third person of the Torah to the first person usually used in the scroll, and the addition of the second divine name based on verse 29, again evidence of the harmonizing tendency of either our text or the author's Vorlage. We have contended that this passage represents an intentio nal, indeed midrashic, harmonization of the material in Deut.Deut. 12,20-25, our primary text at this point in the scroll, with the commands of Deut. 12,15-16. This claim can only be sustained if an explanation can be offered of the legal and exegetical ramifications of this editorial and exegetical process. The Rabbis also had trouble dealing with the existence of these two passages. Deut. 12,15-16 actually appears to be a doublet of the material in 20-25. The Rabbis took Deut. 12,15 as referring to sacrifices disqualified by permanent blemishes which could be redeemed and eaten. (67) The author of our scroll wanted to eliminate the confusion regarding these two passages which he believed concerned one and the same matter, the slaughter of (64) M. Hullin 6:1. (65) It appears from our text and 11QT 52,12 that the scroll, like the Rabbis, applied Lev. 17,13 only to non-sacrificial slaughter, as does appears to be its literal meaning. Cf. M. Hullin 6:1.

He, therefore, harmonized the two passages and created one consistent whole, as was his wont in such cases. This subject as a whole was extremely important for him. In 11QT 11QT 52,13-21 this law is stated directly. Further, it is the basis for the law pertaining to the hides of animals in 11QT 47,7 18. Moreover, this aspect is also dealt with in 4QMiqsat Ma'aslehMa'asleh Ha-T0rah.((38)Ha-T0rah.((38) Our passage here is the author's third allusion to this matter and we must presume, therefore, that the elimination of non-sacral slaughter within three days of Jerusalem, apparently practiced by Pharisaic Jews and perhaps by the populace at large, was a central theme of the author/redactor of the Temple Scroll.Scroll. Accordingly, we can understand why he went to such lengths to deal with a passage in the Torah which could be understood differently. Why was it so important for him to show that both passages referred indeed to the same case, non-sacral slaughter beyond the three day limit? The answer is clear from investigation of the text of Deut. 12. The material in verses 20-25 alludes twice to distance from the sanctuary as the reason for permitting non-sacral slaughter. Yet in verses 15-16 the context is different. After discussing sacral slaughter in 13-14 and the requirement that it be performed in the central sanctuary, the text turns to 15-16. No mention of distance occurs, but non-sacral slaughter is discussed and is permitted. This would have led to the conclusion that non sacral slaughter was in fact permitted anywhere, and that the distance aspect is simply relevant to 20-25. One might have thought that three cases were discussed: (1) Jerusalem, where only sacral slaughter could be performed, (2) areas proximate to Jerusalem, within three days' journey, where either sacral or non sacral slaughter was permitted, or (3) those at a distance from Jerusalem where only non-sacral slaughter was possible as no other option existed. Our author wanted to be certain that no hint or remnant of any possibility of non-sacral slaughter in the vicinity (i.e. within three days' journey) of the Temple existed, so he had to interpret this passage as he did, as a duplicate of verses 20 25. Hence he harmonized the two. (68) Cf. L. H. Schiffman, "4QMhjsat Ma'aseh Ha-Torah and the Temple Scroll", F. Garcia Martinez éd., The Texts of Qumran and the History of the Community.

Original Composition The law of judges of 11QT 51,11-18(69) exhibits all of the relationships to the canonical Deuteronomy which we have observed above as well as original composition by the author: f 11]f 11] You shall appoint judges and officers (or: bailiffs) in all your gates (70) and they shall judge the people [12] with righteous judgment. They may not show favoritism (71) in judgment, nor take a bribe, nor [13] pervert justice. For (the taking of) a bribe perverts justice and subverts the cause of righteousness, (72) and blinds the [14] eyes of the wise, thus causing great guilt, and defiling the Temple (literally, "house") (73) with the sinful [15] transgression. Justice, (and only) justice, shall you pursue, in order that you may live and come to inherit[16] the land which I am giving you to inherit (or: to possess) forever. But the man [17] who takes a bribe and perverts righteous judgment shall be put to death, and you shall not be afraid [18] of putting him to death. (74) This law basically follows Deut. 16,18-21. In adapting ver se 18, our author excised the words, 'asher 'adonai 'elohekha noten lekhalekha li-shevatekha. This is a difficult omission to explain. The author of the scroll had an ideal plan according to which the tribes of Israel would dwell in cities arranged around the central sanctuary in Jerusalem. Accordingly, we would have expected him to assume that there would be a central court of justice for each tribe. Apparently, unlike the Rabbis (75) our author felt the tension between the requirement of appointment of tribal courts (li-shevatekha) and those in the cities (bekhol she'arekha), and (69) See the left column of the fragment Rockefeller 43.978 published in Yadin II, p. 225 and III, Supplementary Plates, Plate 39*:6. Although the fragment preserves only the rightmost part of the column it confirms the presence of the non-biblical addition in 11QT 51,16-18. (70) Yadin, "towns." (71) Yadin II, p. 228 notes that ykyrwpnym is written as one word in the MS. of 11QT (see III, Plate 66). His suggestion that the scribe considered this a "legal term" is unlikely as there are so many other such terms which are not combined in the scroll. His alternative suggestion that the scribe first wrote the singular ykyr pnympnym and then added the waw is much more likely, since the singular is found in MT. (72) Yadin's translation "of the righteous" is of MT sadiqim, not of 11QT. (73) Maier, p. 120 is imprecise when he speaks of "pollution of the Land." The passage speaks of the Temple. (74) Lit "afraid of him from putting him to death." For the reading mmnw in the scroll, see Yadin II, p. 229. (75) Sifre Devarim 144 (ed. Finkelstein, pp. 197f.), B. Sanhédrin 16b, but note the questions of Tosafot, ad 10c. and Nahmanides to Deul. 16,18.</page><page sequence="21">563 THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF X1QT decided to follow a system of setting up courts by location and district, rather than by tribal identification. This conclusion was reached despite the assumption of the scroll that the biblical tribal definitions would exist in the ideal society which the complete scroll envisaged. (76) It is possible that this is an example of disagreement between the Deuteronomic Paraphrase and other sections of the scroll. Such a disagreement has been observed between the laws of war in the Paraphrase and the law of the King. (77) Yet it is probable that the scroll interpreted li-shevatekha here to refer to the geographic entites for each tribe in which the cities were, of course, to be located. The three prohibitions on showing favoritism, taking bribes, and perverting justice, appear here in a different order from that in Deut.Deut. 16,18 in the MT. MT 11QT pervert justice show favoritism show favoritism take bribes take bribes pervert justice Since both MT and 11QT continue with an explanation of the reasons why the taking of bribes is forbidden, MT flows more smoothly since it places this offense last. Further, the perversion of justice can be taken as a general category in MT, specified by the following cases. There is no question, then, that MT presents a superior text. But how did llQT's version come into being? The only possibility is that the author sought to indicate that the prohibition 10' lalleh mishpat in Deuteronomy referred to bribery, (78) and, hence, the author changed the order purposely. Otherwise, we would have to reckon with a textual variant or simply an error. This interpretation would favor a translation as follows: "Nor take a bribe lest you pervert justice, for...." In addition, 11QT phrases these three prohibitions (or two according to the second translation) in the plural, in agreement with the LXX as opposed to MT which has the singular. Yet this is not simply a matter of textual variation. While Deut. 1,17 (10' takkiru fanim ba-mishpat) may certainly be an influence here, (79) (76) Cf. L. H. Schiffman, "Architecture and Law: The Temple and its Courtyards in the Temple Scroll, "From Ancienl Israel 10 Modern Judaism, Intellect in Quest Quest of Understanding, Essays in Honor of Marvin Fox, ed.

SHIFFMAN 564 more important is the author's successful attempt to smooth over the shift in number and person between Deut. 16,18 and 19. The end of 18 is phrased in the third person plural, referring to the judges and officers. Yet verse 18 in MT is in the second person singular, the language of so many biblical apodictic commands. Our scroll has smoothed this inconsistency over by making both verses agree, stating the entirety in the third person plural, so that it is clear that it is the officials of verse 18 (not some nebulous "you") who must fulfill the commands of verse 19. Again, we deal with exegetical variants here, but in this case the LXX represents the same interpretation. Our author may have been encouraged to make his change by the existence of versions of the text in the plural. The author has inserted the words ki ha-shohad mallehmalleh mishpat.mishpat. This addition is to emphasize the very same interpreta tion he made before, namely that the Torah's statement at the start of verse 19, 10' tatteh mishpat, was intended to refer to taking of bribes, and not to be a general statement. In formulating this clause he must have been influenced by Ex. 23,6, 10' tatteh mishpat 'evyonekha'evyonekha be-rivo. (80) In any case, this addition is certainly exegetical. In adapting Deut. 16,19b, the author again reversed the order for exegetical reasons, He wanted to make the point, following his addition, that bribery leads to perversion of justice, continuing his general understanding of the passage. Hence, he wanted to put the clause regarding slp, the subverting of righteousness, before that discussing the "blinding" of the wise. In other words, he sought to complete his discussion of the perversion of justice before moving on to "blinding" of the judges. Only then, after this reversal, does he proceed to mention the "blinding" of the eyes of the wise. (81) In the process, another difference with MT is introduced. HQT has divre ha-sedeq for MT divre sadiqim, which is parallel to 'ene hakhamim. (82) Accordingly, it is likely that the reading of MT is accurate and that an intentional change was introduced into 11QT. Further, MT is supported by the parallel in Ex.Ex. 23,8.(83) Yet the author of the Paraphrase seeks to explain divre divre sadiqim in the text he had before him as referring to righteousness, not to the words of righteous people. In this (80) Yadin II, p. 228. (81) Cf. the similar explanation of Yadin II, p. 228. (82) Note the enigmatic interpretation of these words in Sifre Devarim 144 (ed. Finkelstein, pp. 199): 'en yose yede 'olamo 'ad she-yoreh sedeq be-hora'ato. (83) Ex. 23,8, however, has piqhim for Deuteronomy's hakhamim.</page><page sequence="23">THE DEUTERONOMIC PARAPHRASE OF X1QT 565 interpretation he is in agreement with a number of sources (84) including the LXX to Ex. 23,8.(85) We see these sources as representing exegesis as well, not as preserving a variant textual tradition. This modification again seems to be exegetical, and the suggestion that it is to be linked with the prominent use of sdq in sectarian texts (86) seems to be unfounded. A true textual variant here would be difficult to imagine because of the parallel in Exodus and in the previous phrase in the Deuteronomic verse. In both clauses the text of 11QT has a participle where MT and Ex.Ex. 23,8 have the imperfect. While it is difficult to be certain, the author seems to have been motivated to change the tenses by the desire to emphasize that this is not a matter of question, i.e. that acceptance of such bribes or gifts may have a deleterious effect, but, rather, that it must have this effect. At this point the scroll includes an entire sentence which despite some biblical parallels (87) is of original composition by the author of the scroll or of the Paraphrase. This sentence further explains the reason why bribery is forbidden as it leads to great guilt and defiles the Temple. Here the author is again emphasi zing his basic theme of the evil of injustice. The text then returns to Deul. 16,20 which appears here with a number of variations from MT. U-va'tah has been introduced under the influence of Deut. 6,18. This addition may represent a harmonizing tendency. Another possibility is that it may be a reflection of an earlier harmonization on the part of some Vorlage.Vorlage. The change from the mention of God in the third person to the first person is typical of the scroll and has been discussed in detail. For MT lakh, singular, the scroll has lakhemah, plural. (88) The entire clause may be derived from Deut. 5,28 ...'asher...'asher 'anokhi noten lahem le-rishtah, with the change from the third person to the second, required by our text, based on the use of lakhemlakhem in Deut. 4,1; 11,17 and 11,31. Certainly, we are dealing here with an author who has reworked the text following Deuteronomic style. However, the author did not systematically weave these passages together. Rather, he derived his style from the Deuteronomic idiom in making these additions. (84) Targum Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan (cf. Palestinian Targum) to Deul.Deul. 16,19, Saadyah Gaon in Ibn Ezra to Ex. 23,8, cited in Yadin II, p. 228. (85) But LXX to Deul. 16,19 has logous dikaion, "words of the righteous." (86) Yadin II, p. 228. Cf. J. M. Baumgarten, "The Heavenly Tribunal and the Personification of Sedeq in Jewish Apocalyptic," Aufslieg und Niedergang derder Rômischen Well II. 19, Judenlum: Allgemeines Palâslinisches Judenlum, ed. W. Haase (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1979), 219-39. (87) Yadin II, p. 229. The parallels to sectarian literature which Yadin cites are somewhat overdrawn since the phrases in question are themselves based on the Bible. (88) LXX has the singular, soi, Vulgate, libi.</page><page sequence="24">L. H. SHIFFMAN 566 Associative stringing together of Deuteronomic language led the author to add kol ha-yamim. After all, Deut. 12,1 has le rishtahrishtah (then a pause, 'etnahta' in Masoretic accentuation), followed by kol ha-yamim. Again this is a matter of harmonization and expansion based on Deuteronomic language, not a case of textual variation. At the end of this section, the author (or his source) again introduces his own legal statement, mandating the death penalty (we-ha-'ish(we-ha-'ish 'asher... la-hamito) for one who takes a bribe. This addition is consistent with the view of the scroll that the main point of Deut. 16,18-20 is the prohibition of bribery. The very same idea appears in the original section of the Law of the King in 11QT 11QT 57,19-21 and may be a reflection of the complaints of the author or his source with the state of affairs in Judea in the Hellenistic period. (89) Here the author sides with the view that these prohibitions refer to the judges, rather than to the witnesses.witnesses. (90) Josephus (Apion II, 207) also says that a judge who accepts bribes is subject to the death penalty, but no indication of the derivation of this law appears there. (91) The author has concluded by midrashic exegesis that perver sion of justice is a capital offense. Deut. 1,17 uses 10 taguru mi penepene 'ish regarding the avoidance of favoritism in judgment (ibid., to'to' takkiru fanim ba-mishpat). Our author compared this command midrashically to 10' tagur mimmenu (LXX pi. taguru) regarding the obligation to execute the false prophet in Deut.Deut. 18,22.(92) Accordingly, he concluded that just as the death penalty was required for the false prophet, so it was for judges who accepted bribes. In this exegesis the verse designed to encourage judges to go ahead with the execution of the false prophet is made to refer to corrupt judges. Further, la-hamito may have been taken from the law of the idolatrous prophet in Deut. 13,10.(93) Indeed, we have seen two types of midrashic exegesis. In one, that dealing with non-sacral slaughter, biblical passages dealing with the same subject are harmonized into a composite whole. In the second, that which resulted in the death penalty for corruption, one biblical passage was interpreted in light of another. This is the classic form of midrash. (89) Cf. Schiffman, "The King," pp. 253-5. (90) See the detailed discussion in Yadin I, pp. 383-5 regarding Qumran parallels and Rabbinic traditions. On the death penalty for purjury, see S.

The additional materials which Wise has included in his deliniation of this section are not in fact based on Deuteronomy but rather have as their main text other Pentateuchal materials. The entire section we have investigated is based on adaptation of the canonical Deuteronomy with the addition of the material in the Law of the King, apparently a préexistent source, and other smaller pieces of original composition, composed either by the author or a source. Further, most of the variations from MT in the Paraphra se result from intentional activity, harmonistic, exegetical, halak hie or midrashic, and most of these variations are the result of the efforts of the author/redactor. Indeed, this is to be expected in light of the manner in which the Temple Scroll was composed. It is not simply a selection of biblical quotations. Rather, it is a carefully undertaken reworking of the biblical text through which the author/redactor seeks to express his own unique message. The scroll as a whole must be seen as an exegetical work. We have argued elsewhere that the author/redactor created this section to allow him to complete his new Torah, the Temple Scroll,Scroll, and that he incorporated into it the préexistent material in the Law of the King, most probably one of the sources from which he compiled the Temple Scroll. The present study accords completely with those initial conclusions since it shows how the author/redactor would have gone about creating this Paraphrase from a Deuteronomy which while not exactly the same as MT differed only in minor, textual variations of the kind known to us from the ancient versions and the Qumran biblical manuscripts. Hence, the Paraphrase also indicates to us that the canonical Deuteronomy Deuteronomy served as the guide and authority of our author in preparing the Deuteronomic Paraphrase. This should in no way surprise us in light of the many Deuteronomic passages known to us in the manuscripts of Deuteronomy and the Phylacteries from Qumran. There is no question that the author of our scroll worked from a Deuteronomy similar to that preserved in the canonical Deuteronomy.Deuteronomy. In the main, then, the Deuteronomic Paraphrase is a work of exegesis, having much more in common with the rest of the Temple Scroll Scroll than is often recognized. It illustrates the extent to which what may at first glance appear to be variant biblical texts may be the result of purposeful exegetical activity which took place throughout the Second Temple period.
