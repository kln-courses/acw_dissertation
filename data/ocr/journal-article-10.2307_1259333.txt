<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOLKLORE * VOLUME 80 o SPRING 1969 The Daughter of the Dragon by E. G. SUHR THE best key to the origin, aniconic or otherwise, of the goddess Athena lies in her attributes, a number of which were added to the Pheidian statue of the chryselephantine Parthenos; the best copy, for our purposes, is the Varvakeion version in the National Museum of Athens. First, the full panoply of armour spoke for her warlike character, her impregnable defence. On the helmet was a figure of the sphinx, two of the pegasos and, according to Pausanias,' it was also decorated with two griffons. On the shield was the head of the medusa which Buschor2 believes has survived in the Ron- danini mask of Munich; the same figure has been worked into the aegis on her chest. Resting on the right hand of the Athens copy is a small image of the Victory goddess, an attribute Athena shared with Zeus as an emblem of invulnerability. The only outstanding attribute not in evidence on the original statue was the owl, the bird of darkness appearing most frequently on Athenian coins. Perhaps the most important vestige of her ancestry was the serpent couched inside the shield, the head raised to attack any aggressor. There are two versions of the birth of the goddess: one claims she issued forth from the head of Zeus, the other, somewhat vague, makes her the offspring of Poseidon (sometimes Zeus) and Triton. Hesiod,3 our best authority for the first version, asserts that, after swallowing Metis, his wife, he gave birth to Athena through his head, on the banks of the river Triton. On black figured ware and, supposedly, in the east pediment of the Parthenon, Hephaistos or Prometheus split open the head of Zeus with an axe, whereupon the goddess sprang forth, full-grown and fully armed and took her place at her father's side. Accordingto Aristokles4 she sprang from a 1 1, 24, 5 2 Medusa Rondanini Stuttgart, I958, p. 38 f. S Teog., 886-900, 924-6. 4 Duemmler in RE II, p. 1979. A I</page><page sequence="2">THE DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON cloud which Zeus split, and Bergk5 claims the head is a mountain from which the spring Triton rose. I agree with the latter when he suggests that the birth from the head of Zeus is the later version, especially since the mention of Triton6 survives in the account about the anthropomorphic Zeus. Stesichoros (fr. 62), it has been claimed, was the first to give the account of Athena springing from the head of her father.' The festival of Athena Skiras, when the priest carried a large white umbrella, may have been derived from thecloud or shadow enveloping the figure of Athena at the time of her birth. The references to the second version are numerous, that of Herodotus8 being typical: Athena is the daughter, according to report, of Poseidon and the Tritonian lake, and because she be- came angry with her father she transferred her family loyalty to Zeus. From this tradition she is known to Homer and many an ancient writer as Tritogeneia, but hardly a single author will hazard a reason for the epithet or for the meaning of Triton, beyond the statement that it is a lake, a river, a spring on a water torrent; at all events it seems to have something to do with water. A literal interpretation or presentation of the goddess born from water is as ridiculous as a literal birth from a god's head, although the state- ment that she bathed in Triton's waters9 suggests a parallel with the immersion of the child Achilles in the waters of the Styx and Siegfried's bath in the blood of the dragon. We know, too, that the terms water, cloud, shadow or darkness are used to denote a common denominator in the realm of the fabulous beast, namely the dragon, and Athena, in addition to the serpent rising up menacingly inside her shield, has a number of associations with this ambivalent monster. But what is meant by Triton and how did the term apply to Athena? First, one is led to Triton, the advance guard of Poseidon's cortege over the broad back of the sea, but very little can be discovered by an attempt to identify him with Athena's early history; the only common element to be observed at the greatest divergence in their history is that of water. 5 Ibid., p. 1987. 6 Apollodorus I, 3, 6.

H. D. Rouse (Loeb) because it seems to have no apparent bearing on either Triton or Athena. Now we can establish a link between Poseidon and his daughter Athena by way of a more significant Triton incorporating in her make-up some- thing of water, cloud, shadow or darkness clinging to the picture of a certain dragon. Nonnus calls Athena triform; he also adds that the moon is triform which is also true of Athena, whom he calls Tritonis. As unusual as the term is, applied to a human figure, or for that matter, to any figure, the author may have been thinking of a figure stretched out on three sides or a three-sided figure;11 certainly the reference is not to a triple figure, like that of Hecate. An important statement by Plutarchl2 must be added here: he informs us that Pythagoras called the equilateral triangle Trito- geneia, because it is divided by three perpendiculars drawn from the three angles. Whether the term 'triform' of Nonnus is based on the three sides or the three angles of such a triangle, Athena appears to have a connection with a triangle related to the moon, a connection vouched for by a man who was an acknowledged authority on the astronomy of his day. What did Nonnus and Pythagoras find in the moon to explain the birth of our goddess by way of an isosceles triangle? Several years ago I ventured to identify the head of the medusa with that of the earth-born dragon holding the sun in its mouth, the first stage in solar eclipse representation.'3 The second stage came after the astronomer recognized the lunar shadow for what it was, but since symbolism is cumulative from one period to another, we sometimes find the shadow and the medusa mask in the same area. On this particular head, painted on the Porto-Attic amphora of Eleusis, we find the gruesome face of the monster from the first stage, and extending from the crown to the nose, between the eyes, an equi- lateral triangle, a triform shadow or water way from which Athena was born. As we have stated, the shadow replaced the earlier dragon which is also identified, in some cases, with water, hence the 10 V, 73. 11 See also Tzetzes' Commentary on Lycophron 519. 12 Moralia 381 F. 13 Folklore, 76, 1965, p. 90-0o3, pl. IV, fig. I. 3</page><page sequence="4">THE DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON goddess can be said to have issued from a river or spring, from the darkness of the shadow, from the triform figure of a triangle which is an extension of the moon, or from the body of the dragon, the mate of Poseidon who was the god of the wind. As she left the shores of the Tritonian lake or river, she carried with her a number of dragon features we must now consider. The dragon of the solar eclipse, as well as its immediate suc- cessors, the unicorn and the messiah, is usually characterized by four decided advantages: an invulnerable defence; the ability to heal and provide; and a kind of wisdom, more akin to what we call prophecy. In place of the horned skin which rendered Moses and Siegfried invulnerable (the waters of the Styx dragon served the same purpose for Achilles) Athena was clad in full armour from the moment of her birth; the sculptor of Athena Hygieia made so bold as to remove her armour in favour of civilian dress. On no occasion in her career, whether she contends for herself or defends one of her heroes, does Athena back away from an enemy... even the god Ares. Another asset in her defence was the goddess Victory, a winged female figure shared with her father, who either hovers over her or rests on her hand. We know, of course, that this goddess was not always the charming winged figure of Paionios or that from Samothrace, that with the coming of Zeus as lord of the sky she was graduated from the form of a monster to that of a human. Hesiod'4 informs us that she was originally the daughter of Pallas and Styx, a dragon and a creature of great power in her own right; Styx and her children came to the aid of Zeus in his struggle against the Titans, hence she became the guardian of the sacred oath which both man and god must respect, and she and her family were given a dwelling on Olympos. Although she is also devoted to Zeus and hovers over Aphrodite and all manner of victors, victory becomes an extension of the personality of Athena, to such an extent that even the latter goddess is called Nike.'5 If she was reckoned as the daughter of Styx, she must have been a dragon, more or less, but on Olympos she experienced a transformation. . . like Athena herself, without preserving the grim aspects of the earthly monster. 14 Theog. 383-4. 15 Euripides: Ion 457 f.

In lieu of an artifact for purposes of illustration in the earliest period, we must depend on Homer who attaches the aegis mainly to Zeus and Athena and emphasizes its connection with the phenomena of the sky;16 only once does he mention the head of the medusa as part of it. Evidently the symbol for the sky, the goatskin, was pre- dominant in its early history, an aspect especially appropriate for Zeus as the sky god; but as Athena came into the foreground of the pantheon the medusa and the scaly surface of her cloak dominated its appearance in sculpture and on vases. Euripides17 states very pointedly that the skin of the gorgon is the aegis of Athena, a gift from Perseus and one used with effective devastation against her enemies. Was the medusa head and skin also associated with the sky? If the medusa head was another way of presenting the total solar eclipse, as I believe, it then assumes a rightful place in the centre of the heavenly aegis, for the lunar shadow was also con- strued as a cloud of the sky. The reticulated pattern of the aegis, which was popular in the east as well as in Greece, as Hopkins points out, is a development from an old theory about the compo- sition of the moon, comparing its translucent substance to a filter- like cloth'8 through which the eclipsed sun shines with a subdued light. The solar eclipse was one of the most dramatic phenomena early man observed in the sky. Evidence for this interpretation of the reticulated pattern can be best observed in two manuscript illustrations published by F. Lajard'9 many years ago (Plate I). In the one we find the round face of the sun, jovial and sparkling with rays jutting out in all directions, riding along in a wagon drawn by four horses. In the other the same head, now in a state of fright and shorn of its rays, is placed in a wagon drawn by four asses or mules; the crescent of the moon holds 16 Clark Hopkins has made a clear and well organized statement on the aegis in the Bucknell Review for December (XII) 1964. p.

On the body of the latter wagon the reticulated pattern, absent from the first illustration, is clearly visible, the whole scene an obvious picture of the solar eclipse. The filtering light of the moon and that of the sun were reflected from the aegis of Athena, in fact her whole figure seems to have been enveloped in the darkness of the earth-born dragon. Athena was also a provider, perhaps in a more specific sense than other divinities whose fertility program ranged over much broader areas in meteorology. She is credited with the gift of the olive tree20 she offered in competition with Poseidon for the patronage of Attica, but we must beware of thinking of this cultivated tree as the original adjunct to her history; it was more than likely a variation on the tree of life. It is generally believed that the cult of the god- dess in Athens is older than her association with the tree, which may mean the tree was an importation from abroad or that it derives from the tree of life flourishing at the summit of the cosmic column. The olive tree Athena originally planted on the acropolis2. was certainly associated with the old city goddess, the Athena Polias of the Erechtheum whose image was fashioned from olive wood and whose patronage embraced the arts of peace and the cultivation of the soil,22 in contrast to the war-like Parthenos; the two Athenas, however, were not diametrically opposed, the old city goddess also furnished with the dreaded aegis. The olive tree was also a commanding feature of other city goddesses, especially the Athena of Tyre,23 whose miraculous position at the apex of a cosmic construction and whose features suggest it was borrowed from the cosmic column. We must also note that the dragon encircles the tree but poses no threat to the eagle above, for this symbolic construct of Athena, like the goddess herself, precludes any conflict between the forces of the sky and the earth. In the course of time the tree was brought over into the contest of Posiedon and Athena for the land of Attica, then reflected into the agriculture of the peasant. Athena as the healer was known as Hygieia, a name associated 20 Diodorus (V, 73, 7) claims Athena taught men the care of the olive tree. 21 Apollodorus 3, 14, I. 22 C. J.

If we can judge from statuary,24 the goddess has put off her stern expression, her defensive armour in favour of a milder approach to the ills of man. Her cult in Athens, rather local in character, was by no means as popular as that of Asclepios and her functions in Greece were not so devoted to the healing of limbs or disease; she was more con- cerned with the derangement of the mind and purification from blood-guilt: she it was who infected Ajax with a madness that led to his undoing and subsequently she cleared his mind before his suicide; she drove the daughters of Cecrops to leap, in their madness, from the acropolis; she it was who purified Orestes and converted the Furies into Eumenides; she and Hermes purified the daughters of Danaos after the murder of their husbands.25 Her reputation as a healer of the body arose from an incident connected with the erection of the Propylaea: she was instrumental in healing a workman who had fallen from a considerable height.26 In general, however, she was an arbiter over the excesses committed against moderation, either bringing about or healing a victim of madness. Athena had no seat of prophecy or oracle, yet she, like Siegfried after bathing in the dragon's blood, had a definite command over the prophetic gift. According to J. Schwabe,27 the gift of prophecy belonged to a female serpent, which, if we accept this statement as valid, would explain why Athena was a female. The outstanding example of Athena's control of prophecy is that of Tiresias28 who, once blinded by the goddess for catching sight of her in the nude, was unable to restore his sight at the behest of Chariclo but cleaned out his ears so that he could understand every note of the birds. Another is Melampos29 who, although Athena is not mentioned by name, acquires the understanding of birds' voices after snakes licked his ears. Again, as in the dragon and eagle of the cosmic construct of the city of Tyre, there is the unusual friendly rapport between the dragon of the earth and the bird of heaven. Homer is also credited with this kind of prophetic insight.30 This is the wisdom which Apollo inherited from the earth goddess in Delphi, which Athena, 24 B.

It can now be recognized that Athena with her dragon inheritance of invulnerability, providing, healing and prophecy was in the same category as the messiah and his forerunners, the unicorn and the medusa head. In her we find something of the protective defence of Krishna, Moses, Achilles, and Siegfried, something of the providing in the miracles of Moses and Christ, the darkness of Krishna and King Arthur, the solar and lunar features of the cone-shaped shadow. She is, however, one of the Olympian immortals, and therefore she shows no weakness in struggling with an arch enemy nor is she brought to an end at an early date. The Greek apparently had no need for the personal relationship between a god-made-man, subject to human limitations, and the downtrodden human (Achilles, who has all the dominant features of the messiah, has little of the personal touch of Krishna, Moses or Christ). Athena, at times with, most times without her aniconic dragon, stands by the hero as he puts forth his best efforts to maintain order and balance in the cosmic column. In the new order of the Olympic pantheon she represented something of the same connection between heaven and earth as Aphrodite and Hermes in the old order. In a sense, she was bisexual like the hermaphroditic column - she was a masculoid virgin with no interest in the sexes. Now let us return to the birth of the goddess: how can we reconcile her birth from the head of Zeus with the earlier emergence from the three-sided (Tritonian) dragon-water-shadow? What dragon of ancient lore figured as her mother, the mate of Poseidon who at that time was the chief god of the pantheon and lord of the fertilizing wind ?31 Probably not the Styx, for she had lost her identity on Olympos, except for her control of the sacred oath; she failed to achieve anthropomorphic status. The most likely candi- dare, as we have already suggested, was the medusa herself. In addition to her identity with the shadow-dragon of the eclipse and the role she plays on the aegis and shield, both she and Athena are shrouded in semi-darkness (for Athena this is expressed by the owl), both share something of the reticulated pattern and both are fierce- 31 For a better understanding of this statement see my Before Olympos New York, I967, p. 25 f. 8</page><page sequence="10">THE DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON eyed. The ambivalence of the medusa, the terror and ecstasy of her expression were passed on to Asklepios by Athena in the form of blood from the viens of the gorgon - that from the left side he used for the bane of mankind, that from the other side for its salvation;"32 the extremes of joy and sorrow were inherent in both. If the creation from the head of Zeus has any connection with the triangular shadow, it must refer to the top or head of that triangle. The marriage of a powerful god of air in motion or wind33 to a cone-shaped horn or shadow is also recorded by Diodorus,34 under different names but bearing the same significance: while Ammon, the husband of Rhea, was touring his kingdom, he met a beautiful maiden whose name was Amaltheia, with whom he fell in love and and by whom he became the father of Dionysos. He made her the mistress of the region round about, shaped like a bull's horn, a land abounding in fruits and vines aplenty. To avoid the suspicious jealousy of Rhea he removed the child to a paradise island, Nysa by name, also abounding in plenty and beauty and surrounded by the river Triton. On this island there was a cave that widened out, once the intruder had passed through the entrance, all lighted by the rays of the sun. Throughout the interior leaves and flowers never fade or fall. Athena is appointed guardian of the child in the cave, Athena who, just a short time before, had been born of the earth and found beside the river Triton, for which reason she was called Tritonis. In this tale the motive of the connection between heaven and earth has been repeated variously four times: first, the figure of Amaltheia, known in the Olympic pantheon as the nursemaid of the child Zeus, is the anthropomorphic version of the cornucopia or horn of plenty she carries as her aniconic form, and this horn, like that of the unicorn, is another diminutive form of the lunar shadow. The benign or fertility aspects of the dragon-shadow are manifest in the inexhaustible supply of food issuing from the horn. Second, the domain carved out for Amaltheia is shaped like a bull's horn, the type of unicorn found in ancient Greece and Persia.3" Third, the island of Nysa with its cave that widens out in the interior, beyond 2" Apollodorus 3, o10, 3;Euripides: Ion 1oo3 f.

II. 9</page><page sequence="11">THE DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON the entrance; inside is a veritable fairyland atmosphere like that presented in the other world of the Arthurian saga. The sun illum- inating vegetation and trees that never fade or lose their leaves leads us to think of the cave as the interior of a cone leading to the heavens above. The fourth figure is the guardian Athena, the Tritonis who requires no further mention at this point. Most important for us is the marriage of Ammon, a divinity of the sky, with Amaltheia, a bond which has its roots embedded in astronomy and meteorology and is paralleled by the union of Poseidon and the medusa, the later marriage of Zeus and Metis, the dragon daughter of Styx; that of Zeus and Leto, another shadow character, belongs in the same category, but since there was no prediction that her child would overthrow his father, there was no need for Zeus to swallow her into the bowels of anonymity. Dionysos, the god of earth's vegetation, is the symbol of plenty born from the union of heaven and earth. Another and more important question is implicit in the new alignment of divinities after Athena's rebirth from the head of Zeus: why does Athena turn upon her early mother with such vicious hatred? Why did she become angry with her father Poseidon36 and then turn to a family alliance with Zeus? The answer lies in the change of emphasis from the religious hegemony of the earth with its dragon features to the lordship of the sky. Poseidon was trans- ferred from the domination of the winds above to the varied moods of the sea, and the medusa was relegated to the outposts of civilized areas, to the realm of nocturnal spectres. But Zeus, like a good politician, realized he would have to make a compromise with the powers of the earth to maintain some semblance of power and prestige on his Olympian throne. He raised the dragon Styx and her two children from the earth to a heavenly status (a dwelling on Olympos was always a flattering political plum) where Styx main- tained a faded glory in the sacred oath, Metis was swallowed, and Victory, the only one to achieve anthropomorphic standing, sur- vived as a handsome minion for father and daughter; like Hermes she had no personality of her own, except as a compliant herald of her two masters. Poseidon and the medusa were deprived of parent- hood in favour of the new lord who created Athena as the best 36 Herodotus IV, 18o. IO</page><page sequence="12">THE DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON possible example of a bisexual cosmic column. And what is the meaning of Metis and Victory? They represented the extensions of the dragon personality, concrete manifestations of the wisdom and invulnerability Athena inherited from her mother's side of the family. She stole spinning from Aphrodite, the handicrafts from Hephaistos and the patronage of the citizens of Attica from Posei- don; these three had to effect something of a change of emphasis to reassert themselves in the respect of the common people. Athena, as the arch enemy of her progenitors, is not the most lonesome creature in divine circles. There is the conflict between Krishna and Kaliya, Christ and Satan; Siegfried, Achilles, Beowulf and Jason are all declared enemies of the dragon, Herakles has an encounter with the hydra and other serpentine monsters; Leto met a formidable dragon, after the birth of her two offspring on Delos. But the dragon is never completely overcome or lost to view; she has carried nothing away from her constant war with the sky except a goat's beard and the female gender of Athena but appears again and again in ever-changing, guises bringing agony and ectasy to her friends and foes.
