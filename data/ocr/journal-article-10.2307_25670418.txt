<plain_text><page sequence="1">PJMU Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange JOHN TEEHAN Hofstro University Evolution has been a controversial theory since before Darwin pub lished On the Origin of Species. Darwin's own apprehension concern ing the impending outcry over his work is well known. Almost one hundred and fifty years later, evolution seems to have lost little of its power to stir up resistance and opposition. For those working within evolutionary studies it causes little surprise (though perhaps no little dismay) to witness the ongoing battle against evolution waged by cer tain religious groups. What perhaps is surprising, however (though not necessarily dismaying), is to witness the ongoing struggles within evo lutionary studies over possible extensions of evolutionary theory. I refer here to the issue of evolutionary ethics?not the evolutionary study of moral emotions or behavior, though this field is not without controversy, but specifically the implications of evolutionary theory for the norma tive study of ethics. That those generally opposed to evolution would also be opposed to evolutionary ethics is mere consistency. That those who accept evolution would be opposed, at times passionately opposed to evolutionary ethics is a much more significant fact. Telling evidence of this is found in Ullica Segerstrale's Defenders of the Truth, in which she writes of the controversy over E. O. Wilson's keynote address to the Human Behavior and Evolution Society Conference in 1996. Wilson is, of course, the author of Sociobiology? and one of the seminal figures in the evolutionary study of human behavior. The Human Behavior and Evolution Society is the profes sional organization for those pursuing the study of humanity from an evolutionary perspective, and is a group that Wilson helped to found. Nevertheless, after his speech the organizers of the conference wrote a letter to Wilson, which was distributed to the entire membership of the The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2002. Copyright ? 2002 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 225</page><page sequence="2">226 JOHN TEEHAN society, in which they questioned whether Wilson had intended to yoke norma tive issues to evolution. John Beckstrom (the author of the letter) informed Wilson that if that was, indeed, what he intended, "I would have to oppose vig orously your position and I expect many in attendance with whom I later dis cussed your speech, would do likewise" (Segerstrale 2000, 363). As Segerstrale documents, this was not the first instance of such a split between Wilson and his evolutionary colleagues, nor is it the only example of profound disagreement within the field over the moral implications of evolution. In fact, not only is this a robust contemporary controversy, it is one that dates to the very beginning of the evolution debates. In 1894, T. H. Huxley published "Evolution and Ethics" (originally his Romanes Lecture of 1893), introduced by an equally lengthy prolegomena. This is a work likely known to most students of the subject, written as it was by Darwin's famed bulldog. What is clearly not well known is that a response of the same title was published a few years later (1898) by a then young and not yet famous American philosopher, John Dewey. It is curious to note that despite Dewey's eminence in twentieth-century philos ophy, and his embrace of evolutionary thinking, he has been all but ignored in the ongoing debate over evolution and ethics. It may prove fruitful to revisit this nineteenth-century exchange, both to see what light it may shed on the contem porary scene and to evaluate Dewey's possible contribution to the discussion. Huxley and Ruthless Evolution Thomas Henry Huxley provides a stellar heritage for those evolutionists who warn against the dangers of conflating the principles of evolution and the rules of ethics. Huxley was the fearless and brash proponent of Darwinism, who not only took the fight to unconvinced scientists, but staunchly defended it against religious and social critics of the day. Yet when it came to the question of evo lution and ethics, he seemed to do an about-face. He wrote, "Let us understand, once for all, that the ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cos mic process, still less in running away from it, but in combating it" (92). Huxley's position follows directly from his conception of the contradictory ends of the two processes. The end of the evolutionary process is survival of the fittest, while the end of the ethical process is "not the survival of those who may happen to be the fittest... but of those who are ethically best" (91). Huxley never spells out what he intends by "ethically best," but he does argue that while the evolu tionary struggle for existence rewards "ruthless self assertion," ethics demands self-restraint and mutual aid (91). Actually, most of "Evolution and Ethics" is a historical review of humanity's attempts to make sense of a world filled with evil. Huxley gives a more detailed defense of his position in the prolegomena, in which he develops a "horticul</page><page sequence="3">Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange 227 tural" metaphor. He begins by considering the country scene outside his win dow, imagining it in its state of nature "two thousand years ago, before Caesar set foot in southern Britain" (38) and then comparing it to its present condition, a well-tended, walled-in garden. The cause of the change was, of course, human intervention. The wild patch of land, overgrown with weeds and shrubs vying for dominance was a result of the process of evolution. The orderly garden is a product of human intelligence, in which the natural struggle for existence waged by the vegetation was replaced by a scheme designed to give all members of the garden adequate space and care. Huxley points out that if the gardener abandons his active intervention, and leaves the garden to the forces of natural selection then it is only a matter of time until the state of nature reclaims the garden (44). This is an effective tool for explaining his concerns. The garden, of course, rep resents civilized society guided by the ethical process in which choices are made in terms of social harmony and progress. In our precivilized state of nature, the struggle for existence favored behaviors that are inimical to a well-ordered soci ety. He concludes that, "since law and morals are restraints upon the struggle for existence between men in society, the ethical process is in opposition to the prin ciple of the cosmic process, and tends to the suppression of the qualities best fit ted in that struggle" (58). Clearly, then, we must choose between the two processes. To follow the "ethics of evolution" is to abandon human society to the unrestrained forces of natural selection, which will destroy our garden. Protecting and advancing the fruits of civilization demands an increasing "inter ference" (93) with the evolutionary process. It is relatively clear what foe Huxley had in mind in writing this piece: Social Darwinism. Early attempts to apply evolutionary theory to human affairs resulted in this most unfortunate episode in the history of ideas, and it was during the heyday of this movement that Huxley wrote this work. In connecting the progress of civilization with resistance to evolution, Huxley is forcefully repudiating the basis of Social Darwinism, which held that the vitality of society depended on allowing natural selection to weed out the unfit. This is a crucial point for under standing not only Huxley's position, but I believe much of the debate over evo lution and ethics. The specter of Social Darwinism, ripe with notions of racial superiority and eugenics programs, looms over the history of the subject. This philosophy is found so morally repugnant that the effort to oppose it, or at least to distance oneself from it, may actually be distorting the discussion of evolu tionary ethics.1 Evolutionary theory is in itself sufficiently controversial that to burden it further with hints of Social Darwinism is to invite an unnecessary social, and perhaps political, outcry. It may well be that some of the resistance to evolutionary ethics among evolutionary theorists is an attempt to protect evo lution from attack over what is to many only a tangential concern. Whether or not Social Darwinism is beneath the surface of contemporary debates, there can be little doubt that it was present to Huxley. Further light is thrown upon the subject when we find that Huxley does see</page><page sequence="4">228 JOHN TEEHAN a role for evolution in our understanding of ethics. He writes that those study ing evolution and ethics "adduce a number of more or less interesting facts and more or less sound arguments, in favor of the origin of the moral sentiments, in the same way as other natural phenomena, by a process of evolution" (90). This is an enterprise Huxley terms the "evolution of ethics," and he approves it as an appropriate avenue of study. This is distinct, however, from the "ethics of evo lution," which seeks to derive ethical principles from the evolutionary process: Cosmic evolution may teach us how the good and the evil tendencies of man might have come about; but, in itself, it is incompetent to furnish any better reason why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before. Some day, I doubt not, we shall arrive at an understanding of the evo lution of the aesthetic faculty; but all the understanding in the world will nei ther increase nor diminish the force of the intuition that this is beautiful and that is ugly. (90) Huxley remained committed to the power of the theory of evolution to explain the origin of the human animal, even of those elements that seem most human, art and morality. We can extrapolate from this and imagine that today Huxley would be a supporter of evolutionary psychology. His belief that we need to oppose the evolutionary process was not an indication that he wanted to limit the scope of evolutionary studies or to mark morality as out of bounds for evo lutionary scientists. It was a specific warning not to commit the naturalistic fal lacy and attempt to derive ethical "oughts" from the facts of evolution. This is the conclusion reached by T. H. Huxley, a philosophically minded sci entist. It will be interesting to see the response this provoked from a scientifi cally minded philosopher, John Dewey. Dewey's Response John Dewey was born in the year Darwin published On the Origin of the Species, yet his intellectual development took a circuitous route to his embrace of evo lutionary thinking. In an autobiographical essay, Dewey wrote of his "intense emotional craving ... that only an intellectualized subject matter could satisfy" (1930, 153). This "craving" was Dewey's fundamental philosophical goal to dis cover an integrated intellectual approach that would overcome the dualistic con ceptions that dominated not only philosophy but intellectual life in general. Conceptual distinctions between subject and object, material and ideal, human ity and nature, facts and values seemed to Dewey to be sometimes useful tools that had hardened into absolute metaphysical categories. This is what Dewey termed "the philosophic fallacy" (1925, 27-28): treating conceptual distinctions</page><page sequence="5">Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange 229 made in the course of investigations as preexisting realities. The consequence of this fallacy is the introduction of artificial divisions into our search for knowl edge, or as Dewey terms it, "useless lumber that blocks our highways of thought" (1930, 160). Dewey originally found satisfaction for this craving in Hegel and the German Idealists, but eventually came to see these systems as "artificial to the last degree" (1930,154). A new direction in his thought was inspired by the biological aspects of William James's work on psychology (1930, 157). This turn toward a more scientific approach needed only the contributions of Darwin to be complete: The gates of the garden of life were barred to the new ideas [i.e., modern sci ence]. ... The influence of Darwin upon philosophy resides in his having con quered the phenomena of life for the principle of transition, and thereby freed the new logic for application to mind and morals and life. (Dewey 1909, 8-9) The lesson that Dewey took from Darwin, which was to form a permanent deposit in his thought, was the notion of naturalism: that human existence is wholly the result of processes that are continuous throughout nature. This becomes the paradigm with which Dewey will interpret the world; this is the tool he will use to finally do away with those destructive and inhibiting dualisms that he finds clogging the path of humanity's intellectual and moral progress. Darwin, then, is co-author of Dewey's naturalism, and insofar as Dewey's particular approach to morals, politics, and religion is based on his naturalism, Darwin's influence is ever present. Dewey's earliest focused discussion of evolution is "Evolution and Ethics" (1898), his response to Huxley. Dewey recognizes that Huxley is responding to Spencer's theory of evolution and morality, and in opposing this theory and its goal of an "insipid millennium" Huxley has Dewey's approval. However, over Huxley's further point that the natural is at odds with the ethical, Dewey believes he "must part company with him" (1898, 47), rejecting the notion that the ethi cal and the evolutionary are incompatible. Dewey's response to Huxley makes two general points: one, Huxley's oppo sition of "natural" and "ethical" rests on a mistaken dichotomy between humans and nature, and two, his conception of natural selection is unduly restrictive. We shall consider these points sequentially. The first point Dewey makes is that the notion of "man's struggle against nature" is flawed. The primary lesson of evolution is that man is part of nature, that whatever it is that makes us unique is itself an eventuation of processes that are continuous throughout the living world. The "struggle against" concept is based on a dichotomous view of man and nature (man versus nature), which evo lutionary theory overthrows. In this light, man's so-called struggle against nature is actually the process through which one part of nature adapts another part of</page><page sequence="6">230 JOHN TEEHAN nature for its own use (1898, 38). The self-assertion that Huxley sees as charac teristic of the struggle for existence is not necessarily an immoral process: I do not see that the struggle for existence is anything more than living exis tence itself. Life tends to maintain itself because it is life. The particular acts which are put forth are the outcome of the life that is there; they are its expres sion, its manifestation. Self-assertion in this sense carries with it no immoral connotation, unless life by its very nature is immoral. (Dewey 1898, 42) Self-assertion, then, is the characteristic activity of living organisms, whether it expresses itself in foraging for food, defending against threats, or reproduction. In all these activities, the organism asserts itself over its environment in order to satisfy its needs; an organism that fails to do this quickly dies out. Self-assertion cannot be morally condemned without condemning life itself. Of course, Huxley is aware of this and it is "ruthless" self-assertion that he condemns as immoral. However, in qualifying the self-assertion of the natural process as ruthless and then opposing it to the ethical process, Huxley is beg ging the question. He needs first to show that the natural process always (or even typically) manifests itself in a ruthless manner. He does so, Dewey argues, only by working with an unjustifiably restricted notion of natural selection. This leads to Dewey's next point. Before proceeding, it is interesting to note that Huxley anticipated Dewey's first criticism. Huxley admits that human effort to organize the environment intel ligently is a result of the "cosmic process," but he points out that that same nat ural process is "constantly tending" to break down and destroy the products of human ingenuity (45). If it is logically flawed to suggest that the natural process can be "in antagonism" with itself, then, Huxley writes, "I am sorry for logic, because, as we have seen, the fact is so" (45). This supports his point that if soci ety is going to progress, we must oppose the natural process that is an unyield ing counterforce to our moral strivings. Dewey, however, does not see mutually opposed forces competing with each other. This "antagonism" is merely the dynamics of life. The natural process is a process, and process implies change and an ever-constant need of modification and adjustment (1898, 41-42). The implementation of human effort does not put a halt to the natural process; it directs it down a certain path. But this is just what all living things do: they strive to direct the natural process in a way that allows them to thrive. The "natural process" is nothing but the efforts of living organisms to continue the process of living. It is not something above or apart from these efforts. Therefore, there is no natural process opposed to the human effort to shape society in a certain way. There is a struggle against elements in the environment in our attempts to further society, but both our efforts and the resistance to our efforts constitute the natural process. There is no dichotomy, but simply different manifestations of the same process.</page><page sequence="7">Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange 231 If we keep this in mind, our understanding of the supposed ethical problem involved in the process of natural selection will be quite different. Huxley's moral concern with natural selection centers on the goal of that process, survival of the fittest. We typically take the term "fittest" to identify those organisms best suited to their environment, and by "environment" we usually mean a physical envi ronment, e.g., geography, climate, food sources, etc.; "fittest," then, is often asso ciated with the strongest, toughest, even the most brutal, those who with "ruthless self assertion" will do whatever it takes to further their goals. But this is a lim ited interpretation of "the fittest." A prominent, often the most prominent, aspect of the human environment is other people. These others are not merely obsta cles to be overcome by brute force (though some may be); they play vital roles in our struggle for existence. These others are potential mates, allies in the hunt, compatriots in self-defense. They are the necessary constituents of the social systems within which we will carry out our struggle for existence. The success of our struggle is powerfully tied to our ability to function effectively in a social environment. Fitness, therefore, must include not only genetic or phys ical adaptability but social adaptability, as well?and it is here that morality enters the scene. As Rawls has put it, social living is "marked by a conflict as well as by an identity of interests" (4). Morality, Dewey notes, is a means of adjudicating between conflicting interests and desires within a social environment (1898,46; 1902, 34-35). It is therefore a necessary element of any complex social system, if that system is going to function effectively as a means of survival. A social group that does not develop a means of adjudicating conflicts in a way that sat isfies the needs of both the group and the individuals within that group (i.e., a moral code) will cease to function as an adaptive system. Evidence of this comes not only from study of human communities but also from studies of our closest relatives, the great apes. Researchers have documented the existence of codes of behaviors and socially established means of resolving conflicts within a variety of species of higher primates (i.e., chimps, gorillas, orangutans).2 This ethical process has clearly become more complex and deliberative within human soci eties, but it just as clearly has its roots in processes that arise in the course of evolution. The question is, can the ethical process, as it functions in the human context, be seen as continuous with the natural process, i.e., natural selection, or does it mark the introduction of a new process that operates independently of, and perhaps incompatibly with, the natural process? In order to answer this ques tion, we need to reconsider the meaning of "natural selection." Dewey points out that we typically understand natural selection to work by the process of "ordeal by death," in which a creature with a certain genetic advan tage reproduces and passes on its genes, while those without the advantage per ish before procreating. But this is not the only way for the process to work; there is also "trial by the success and failure of certain acts" (Dewey 1898,50). Certain modes of behavior give a creature a survival advantage. For example, consider</page><page sequence="8">232 JOHN TEEHAN any new-born mammal, such as a lion cub. Assume all the genetic advantages you will, yet this alone is not sufficient to guarantee survival. Much of the behav ior that prepares the cub for life is learned behavior that comes from interactions with its mother. If the cub is denied that interaction because of the death of its mother, for example, it has lost a crucial survival advantage. This cub will not be as likely to reach the age of reproduction as would a properly socialized cub. Its genetic advantages will not be selected for transmission to the next generation. Since the environment plays a decisive role in natural selection, and society is a key part of the human environment, we may consider social adaptations to be elements of natural selection. This requires a broader conception of natural selection than we are perhaps accustomed to, but Dewey sees this as merely a better grasp of the concept. Natural selection is usually thought of as resulting in a change of structure, and we must admit that the impact of environmental conditions does not produce a change in structure; such a change occurs only through genetic variation over time. Those who equate evolution with "change in structure" are not going to be satisfied with Dewey's position; rather, they are likely to see it as anthropomorphic. Dewey suggests that such a view of evolu tion may be too restrictive. Species do not evolve by the change of structure itself. In fact, changes in structure are often rejected by the evolutionary process. For a change of structure to be "chosen" by evolution, it must confer some sur vival advantage to the individual. Survival, however, is an activity; it is some thing we do. The change in structure, therefore, must eventuate in a mode of behavior or functioning that is more successful in dealing with the environment in order to improve the survival chances of the organism. As Dewey puts it, "The modification of structure is certainly not an end in itself. It is simply one device for changing function" (1898, 50). An organism is "fit" to its environment not because of a certain anatomical structure, but because it can function successfully within its environment. Change in structure is one way of eliciting this functioning, and in prehuman history it was perhaps the major means of doing so, but it is not necessarily the most efficient means. Change in structure provides the tool for a survival advantage, but a tool not properly used is ineffective. Therefore, it is not correct to identify natural selec tion with change of structure. While natural selection may lead to changes at the genetic level, the mechanism for passing those changes on is the behavior of the organism. If we turn our attention to the human world, we can see that there are certain social conditions that work to encourage certain modes of behavior and to dis courage others. If we are going to be consistently naturalistic, we must accept that the conditions of society are as much a part of the environing conditions as are rocks, soil, and water. Just as those conditions support or reject certain modes of action, and thereby influence the path of evolution, so do social conditions:</page><page sequence="9">Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange 233 What difference in principle exists between this mediation of the acts of the indi vidual by society and what is ordinarily called natural selection, I am unable to see. In each case there is the reaction of the conditions of life back into the agents in such a way as to modify the function of living. (Dewey 1898, 50) Given all of this, it seems to follow that if a social practice, e.g., morality, can effect a change in functioning, then it too may serve as a mode of variation in the process of evolution. Furthermore, if it can achieve a change in functioning in a matter of years, that would have taken generations via change of structure, it would seem to be a more effective tool for evolution: If we personify Nature, we may say that the influences of education and social approval and disapproval in modifying the behavior of the agent, mark simply the discovery on the part of Nature of a shorter and more economical form of selection than she had previously known.... It is certainly implied in the idea of natural selection that the most effective modes of variation should them selves be finally selected. (Dewey 1898, 50) At this point, if the critic wishes to argue that this is "cultural" evolution, he or she may do so. Using the label "cultural" may be helpful to point out that the means for changing function in the process of evolution have become primarily cultural. However, the following proviso must be kept in mind: by labeling evo lution "cultural" we do not preclude it from remaining natural evolution. At this point Dewey's first criticism must be recalled. Evolutionary theory does not sup port a dichotomy between "human" and "nature." Morality is a strategy for suc cessfully coordinating action in a joint struggle for existence. It is no less natural than the strategy of nonhuman animals in their struggle for existence. When con sidering the ethical and the natural we are not talking about distinct processes but, rather, distinctively different phases of the same continuous process. Resistance to this conclusion Dewey attributes to the persistent influence of the dualistic thinking that evolution rejects. Evolution and Normative Ethics What lessons are we to take from all of this? Dewey accepts the scientific valid ity of evolution and the homogeneity of its application throughout nature. He notes, however, that humanity's entrance upon the scene changes things, not by the addition of something non-natural, but by being a manifestation of nature as-conscious-of-itself. The blind and wasteful operation of prehuman evolution may now be turned into efficient and deliberate evolution:</page><page sequence="10">234 JOHN TEEHAN the process and forces bound up with the cosmic have come to consciousness in man. That which was instinct in animal is conscious impulse in man. That which was "tendency to vary" in the animal is conscious foresight in man.... That this transfer from unconsciousness to consciousness has immense impor tance, need hardly be argued. It is enough to say that it means the whole dis tinction of the moral from the unmoral. (Dewey 1898, 53) It should be clear that Dewey is not interpreting evolution in a Spencerian, tele ological fashion, as moving inexorably and indifferently through the generations toward some Utopia of moral perfection. Evolution is a natural process and in itself has no moral purpose, yet when that natural process results in a conscious being who can deliberate about its future, it develops a moral aspect. The ethi cal process is just one aspect of the natural process as it expresses itself in the devel opment of the human (and perhaps other) species. The issue that remains to be addressed in this Huxley/Dewey "debate" is the normative role of evolution. As we saw in our discussion of Huxley, his fundamental resistance to evolu tionary ethics was over the issue of deriving normative principles from the prin ciples of evolution. This is a concern that Dewey must address. It is worth repeating Huxley's position on the normative role of evolution: Cosmic evolution may teach us how the good and the evil tendencies of man may have come about; but, in itself, it is incompetent to furnish any better rea son why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before. Some day, I doubt not, we shall arrive at an understanding of the evo lution of the aesthetic faculty; but all the understanding in the world will nei ther increase nor diminish the force of the intuition that this is beautiful and that is ugly. (90) We need only rework this a bit to summarize Huxley's position on evolution and normative ethics, a position that may fairly represent contemporary critics: Evolution may provide us with a greater understanding of our moral nature, but such understanding will neither increase nor diminish the force of the belief that this is good and that is bad, that this is right and that is wrong. It is crucial to understand the full import of this position, for it is just this position that Dewey rejects as the result of confused thinking about ethics. Huxley implies that an evolutionary approach to humans may identify the ori gin of emotions and behaviors that constitute moral phenomena, and in fact much work has been done in this area.3 But Huxley's position holds that regardless of how effective this new science becomes, regardless of how much light it sheds on the process of moral decision making, it will never be able to tell us that this is moral and that is not. Evolution may illuminate the history of ethics, but it has no normative implications.</page><page sequence="11">Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange 235 Dewey evaluated this position in a 1902 essay entitled "The Evolutionary Method as Applied to Morality." In this essay, Dewey states his version of the opposition to evolutionary ethics: The opponent argues thus: It is of course true that morality has a history; that is, we can trace different moral practices, beliefs, customs, demands, opinions, in various forms of outward manifestation.. . . But when this is said and done the result remains history, not ethics. What ethics deals with is the moral worth of these various practices, beliefs, etc. (22) As an example, consider any moral practice, such as marriage. An evolutionary account of such a practice would bring out the conditions under which this prac tice occurs, its function within particular social systems, the social evaluation of such a practice, and so on. The question at issue is, what will all of this tell us about the moral validity of such a practice? The opponent of evolutionary ethics replies, "nothing." This reply, however, is according to Dewey the result of con fusion over the notion of moral validity. There are, says Dewey, two ways of talking about moral validity?there is ultimate moral validity and the validity of a particular moral judgment (1902, 21). Ultimate moral validity is concerned with questions of the nature of the Good, or with Justice itself. These are traditional metaphysical questions, which are not the concern of the moral scientist. The moral scientist is concerned with the second sense of validity, with "ways of determining the respective values of this or that particular judgment" (Dewey 1902, 21). The claim that an evolu tionary account of ethics has no import for normative judgments conflates these two senses of validity. The evolutionary process does not create ultimate moral validity, but it does not follow from this that it has nothing to say about our moral judgments. If we keep these distinctions clear, we will be in a better position to evaluate evolutionary ethics. It is important to note that Dewey, of course, is not working within the tradi tional metaphysical approach to ethics. Ethics is not a search for ultimate defi nitions or transcendent justifications. Ethics is concerned with the evaluations of norms, values, and behaviors in terms of their functionality in the pursuit of certain ends. It is a pragmatic discipline. Therefore, to ask about the moral valid ity of a particular norm, value or behavior is to ask how that thing functions under certain conditions. Dewey's position entails that "norms and ideals ... arose out of certain situations, in response to the demands of those situations; and that once in existence they operated with a less or greater meed of success (to be deter mined by study of the concrete case)" (1902, 23). Morals, in this view, do not descend from some Platonic realm but develop in particular historical processes. Judging whether a particular practice is morally valid requires an understanding of the role of that practice in the historical process in order to make an effective</page><page sequence="12">236 JOHN TEEHAN determination as to its continuing worth. This is what moral judgment is about. To the extent that an evolutionary approach to morals affects our understanding of morals, to that extent it impacts on our moral judgments. For example, let us consider a moral practice common to the societies in which both Dewey and Huxley lived when they wrote these essays: the politi cal, social, and sexual subjection of women to men. At the end of the nineteenth century, this practice was still accepted by most men, and many women, as expression of a natural moral order. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there is a consensus (imperfect and partial, as it may be) that the subjection of women is morally unjustifiable. How do we account for the change? Was there in the intervening years a discovery of the ultimate foundation of ethics? Have philosophers settled on the theory of Justice? Of course not. What has occurred is an increasing understanding of the origins and social function of female sub jugation. The recognition that the justification for male dominance was based not on a natural moral order, but on the interests of males in controlling female sexuality, and so patrimony was effective in changing our judgment of the moral validity of this practice. I do not mean to imply that the improvement in the social standing of women was simply the result of a changed understanding of the origin of that practice, but rather to show that such a changed understanding can have an impact on our moral judgments. We can see that Huxley's claim that "all the understanding in the world will neither increase nor diminish our intuition" that this is good and this is bad, is simply wrong. Instead, we see with Dewey that anything which affects our understanding of a practice or belief affects our judgment of that prac tice or belief and therefore has normative import (1902, 31). An evolutionary account of morality that changes our understanding of moral practices/beliefs can, therefore, play a determinative role in our moral judgments.4 Dewey writes, "moral judgments are judgments of ways to act, of deeds to do, of habits to form, of ends to cultivate. Whatever modifies the judgment... modifies conduct. To control our judgments of conduct... is in so far forth to direct conduct itself (1902, 38). Dewey notes that while Huxley is correct that the natural process does not in itself entail any moral truths, it does generate the conditions which shape moral judgments and so is a part of the ethical process (1902, 35). Before concluding, it may be instructive to revisit the other sense of moral validity, that of ultimate validity. Dewey claims that this is not the concern of moral scientists, but perhaps it is what concerned Huxley. Even Dewey concedes that the evolutionary method cannot speak to questions of ultimate validity, and perhaps this is what Huxley had in mind in setting evolution and ethics in oppo sition. The notion that there is a source of moral values that stands apart from the contingencies of the natural world is one of the most enduring ideas in the history of thought, even if it is not always articulated. It is a stance shared by Platonic, Stoic, Kantian, Judeo-Christian, and Islamic moral systems. One of the great fears generated by evolution is that evolution, by naturalizing ethics, in fact</page><page sequence="13">Evolution and Ethics: The Huxley/Dewey Exchange 237 does away with the very possibility of ethics, leaving nothing but the unrestrained competition of selfish individuals. This is clearly reflected in Huxley's essay. It is telling of the power of this transcendent view of ethics that even Huxley felt the pull of it. If ethics requires a transcendent (i.e., non-natural) grounding and evolutionary thinking does away with such transcendent possibilities, then it seems we must combat evolution in order to save ethics. However, Dewey shows us another possibility. When Dewey argues that the evolutionary/scientific method cannot answer questions of ultimate validity, he is not implying that we need to turn to some other method for those answers. He is implying that we do not need to answer those questions. The ethical issues that concern us are not those of ultimate valid ity but those with concrete, practical consequences for the way in which people live their lives. We do not need the definition of the good; we need to know how to act in order to make things better. We do not need to know what Justice itself is; we need to know how make our social arrangements more just. Critics of evo lution may be correct in their concern that evolution does not provide ultimate justification for morality, but they are mistaken in thinking that morality requires such justification. With or without such ultimate validity there are questions of right and wrong, good and bad, justice and injustice that need to be considered and evaluated in order to improve human lives and social systems. These moral challenges require an effective understanding of the conditions, history and con sequences of moral judgment, and in this moral project the evolutionary method is a valuable tool to be used, not a threat to be combated. Notes 1. A reading of Segerstrale's work provides ample evidence to indicate that this is indeed the case. 2. See, for example, Frans de Waal (1996). 3. See, for example, Richard D. Alexander (1987), Matt Ridley (1997), and Leonard D. Katz (2000). 4. It is important to note that while an evolutionary account of a moral practice can play a deter minative role in our assessment of that practice, it does not necessarily do so. Whether or not it does is an empirical question that can be decided only in the actual process of judgment. Works Cited Alexander, Richard D. 1987. The Biology of Moral Systems.
