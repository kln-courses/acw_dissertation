<plain_text><page sequence="1">660 American Anthropologist [64, 1962] Fiji, their forms and possible cultural significance. It is the outcome of scholarly, laborious, and intensive consideration of museum collections, primarily in western Europe and the United States, and of library and manuscript sources. The work was necessarily scholarly, intensive, and laborious because extremely few Fijian anthropo- morphic images have ever been discovered. Mr. Larsson is cautiously uncertain of the extent to which even these represent an indigenous Fijian tradition. The ritual or reli- gious significance of the images is also unclear. Mr. Larsson's image study is but the by- product of a larger work, as yet incomplete, on coincidence in distribution of dialects, kinship systems, and material culture traits within the Fiji Islands. Aspects of Local Government in a Sumbawan Village (Eastern Indonesia). PETER R. GOETHALS. Foreword by George McT. Kahin. (Cornell Modern Indonesia Project, Monograph Series.) Ithaca, New York: Cornell University, 1961. vii, 143 pp., bibliography, footnotes, frontispiece (map), glossary. $3.00. Reviewed by RODNEY NEEDHAM, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences It has often enough been maintained that a knowledge of the village is fundamental to the understanding of Indonesian society, but in their published ethnography an- thropologists have so far preferred to deal with wider matters. As Goethals pertinently remarks, "villlage democracy" in Indonesia has more often been categorically asserted to exist than carefully scrutinized, and it is this important side of village life, viz., local government, that he examines in his competent and well-written monograph. Nearly a quarter of the text, not at all a disproportionate length, and especially when it is so necessary and so compendious, is given up to an introductory survey of the island of Sumbawa and its history. This is followed by a sketch of the means of sub- sistence and of the "social horizons" of the inhabitants of Rarak, a village of 60 house- holds and over 400 people in the foothills nine miles from Sumbawa Besar, the adminis- trative center of western Sumbawa and the seat of the sultan. The villagers are Muslim farmers, cultivating dry rice, and it is mainly with their internal affairs that Goethals deals in the bulk of his account. In successive chapters he describes the two govern- mental hierarchies of the village, the civil administration and the religious authorities, their offices, dues, and duties; then he presents cases concerning their functions in matters of marriage, illegitimacy, and disputed lands; and he concludes with a con- sideration of cooperatives, change, and conservatism under the influence of the modern Indonesian state. The bibliography is useful, and there is a detailed glossary. One would have preferred to possess a more detailed knowledge of Sumbawan social life and economics before trying to comprehend the particularities of local government, but within its own limits the account is clearly and modestly done, with apt illustrations and a thorough exploitation of the Dutch and other literary sources. The ethnography derives added interest, also, from the fact that Sumbawa is a notably neglected area in Indonesian anthropology. It is only to be regretted that this useful and stimulating monograph should have been published in such a floppy and unpleasing form. There is little enough original modern ethnography from Indonesia, and reports of this kind and ability surely deserve better material presentation. In the present case, too, apart from typing errors ("loss" for "last," mufukat for mufakat, seuw for eeuw, etc.) there are blemishes such as a missing word or line (p. 36) and one completely blank page (123) which should have contained footnotes 5, 6, and part of 7. Theoretically, the monograph is acknowledgedly unambitious, but it prompts cer-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 661 tain more general observations. Goethals decides to exclude any systematic explora- tion of the effects of kinship on matters of local government, on the ground that this must await more adequate anthropological analysis of cognatic societies in general. The obvious first response is that a comparative understanding can only grow from the accumulated descriptions of villages such as Rarak itself. But another, and more radical, objection is that Goethals' demur seems to rest on the assumption that cognatic societies have characteristically some special forms or principles of kinship association in common; whereas it is at least arguable that as far as kinship is concerned they are classed together (unlike societies with lineal descent or prescriptive alliance systems) primarily because of what they lack, and they may be effectively incomparable in those other and often disparate features which actually govern the social life of each. Faced with this possibility, we might do better to concentrate on the elucidation of particular cases rather than embark on (or be deterred by) a search for what positively typifies a negatively defined class. An illustration of this contention is to be found in Goethals' description of the twin hierarchies of traditional government in this small community. Rarak is perhaps one of the last places where one would look, but here we find a clear exemplification of one of the grandest themes in the study of social ideology: the complementarity of secular power and religious authority. This theme, adumbrated by Hocart and splendidly developed by Dumezil, is best known from the great Indo-European civilizations of classical antiquity and ancient India, and it is all the more intriguing therefore when it can be discerned among Muslim peasants in eastern Indonesia. Sovereignty in Rarak is divided into the spheres of adat (local custom) and hukum (Islamic tradition). The headman is the custodian of the former and the head of civil administration in the village; the religious leader (lebe) is the representative of religious authority and is responsible for the community in its relations to its god and the spirits. The former settles law suits between villagers and represents them to higher civil government, while the latter mediates spirtually between man and the supernatural powers. One is concerned with secular interests, the other with mystical; and this polar distinction is none the less clear because secular power and mystical authority actually commingle in everyday affairs. Furthermore, Goethals reports a contrast in character between the two leaders, the secular headman being ebullient and practical, the religious official being quiet and scholarly; and these characteristics are even mirrored, as some villagers themselves observe, in the personalities of the followers of these sovereign figures in the community. This Mitra-Varuna type of representation of sovereignty in Rarak is not, so far as one can see from the work under review, part of a more comprehensive system of symbolic classification such as may be established elsewhere in comparably simple societies, and it does not therefore permit or introduce a concordant integral inter- pretation of the culture. This may be connected with the absence of a lineal descent system, but that the oppositions reported here are not associated with discrete corporate groups makes the methodological point about the study of cognatic societies. In the matter of complementary sovereignty the fact that this is a cognatic society is irrele- vant, and it is not to be expected that comparative research among other societies selected merely because they are cognatic would be of any singular use in understand- ing Sumbawan ideas and beliefs. We have to beware, that is, lest an inappropriate professional obsession with "kinship" and the technical classification of descent sys- tems distract us from the paramount importance of the ideas and forms of classification proper to the societies that we seek to understand. The clarity of Goethals' exposition</page><page sequence="3">662 American Anthropologist [64, 1962] of the complementary values of sovereignty in Rarak, on the other hand, permits us to see the government of this little village as a further instance of one of the most funda- mental and pervasive ideological features of mankind. Ritual Purification of a Balinese Temple. J. H. HOOYKAAS-VAN LEEUWEN BOOMKAMP. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1960. 81 pp., glossary, 44 illustra- tions, index, 16 plates. $3.60. Reviewed by JANE BELO, New York City This scholarly little monograph treats of Balinese religion in the only way it can be treated, in profuse detail as to the offerings and instruments of the purification ritual. The author describes the composition of the lis, the broom-like holy water sprinkler made from young palm leaf, intricately cut out and plaited in symbolic forms. These include anthropomorphic components, such as breast bone, ribs, old belly, young belly, navel, liver, and other symbols such as "stairway up" and "stairway down," various sacred trees and grasses. Besides the description of the components, Dr. Hooykaas in- cludes drawings of some 43 of them, beautifully executed by a Balinese artist, Ida Bagus Anom of Ubud. She consulted religious manuals used by the priests both from private sources and from the libraries in Holland and in Bali, finding in 13 different manuscripts the mantra lis, or prayer formulae as hymns of praise to the lis. She gives the orignals and the English translation with careful cross-referencing of the various texts. A second part of the monograph deals with the ritual objects required when a Brahman Padanda or High Priest officiates to make the holy water. These include miniature tools and utensils made of wood and bamboo, and terra cotta replicas of various offerings, numbering in all 78. Photographs of such a set are reproduced from the collection at the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The whole study bears witness to the continuing interest of Dutch scholars in Indonesia, and to the cooperation of Indonesian and European students of the religion and the culture. No suggestion is made of the possibly compulsive nature of the requirements for purification, which some observers remark upon. Dr. Hooykaas states that she hopes she has succeeded in conveying "something of the religious feeling, the creative capacity, and imaginative ingenuity, which characterize the culture of Bali." The Arts of Thailand: A Handbook of the Architecture, Sculpture and Painting of Thai- land (Siam). THEODORE BOWIE (Ed.) Introduction by H. H. DHANI NIVAT KROMA- MUN BIDYALABH. Acknowledgements by HERMAN B. WELLS. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1960. 219 pp., bibliography, exhibition catalogue, frontispiece (color), index, 1 map, 163 photographs and figures. $8.95. Reviewed by MICHAEL MOER MAN, Yale University This is really three books in one. It is a catalogue of the Arts of Thailand exhibition (pp. 183-213), a major study of Thai Buddhist sculpture and architecture (pp. 25-157), and "A Note on Thai Painting" (pp. 166-174). The book's unity comes from the con- sistency of Thai Buddhist art and through excellent marginal and textual cross-refer- ences to plates and catalogue numbers. Many of Prince Subhadradis' catalogue notes furnish interesting information about Thai iconography and religious behavior. Succinct description and references to plates and text make the notes useful even in the absence of the exhibition for which they were written.</page></plain_text>
