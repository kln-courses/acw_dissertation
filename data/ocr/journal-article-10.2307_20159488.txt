ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS INTRODUCTION The "Academy of Management (AOM) Code of Ethics" sets forth (1) principles that underlie the professional responsibilities and conduct of the AOM's membership and (2) enforced ethical stan dards that apply to members in official AOM roles and to those participating in AOM-sponsored activ ities. The principles are guidelines for everyday professional activities. They constitute normative statements for academicians, researchers, and man agers and provide guidance on issues that AOM members may encounter in their professional work. The enforced ethical standards are standards that individuals must adhere to when participating in and carrying out the work of the Academy of Man agement. Although not enforced outside of the Academy, these standards may also be viewed as guides for positive professional practice. Nonmem bers who participate in AOM activities (e.g., au thors, job seekers, etc.) also agree to adhere to the enforced ethical standards and to abide by the rules and policies pertaining to the specific AOM activ ities they engage in. AOM's "Code of Ethics" consists of these sec tions: Introduction, Preamble, General Principles, Professional Principles, and Ethical Standards. A separate document, the "Academy of Management Code of Ethics Policies and Procedures for Han dling Charges of Ethical Standards Violations," ac companies the "Code of Ethics." The Preamble, General Principles, and Profes sional Principles set forth aspirational goals to guide AOM members toward the highest ideals of research, teaching, practice, and service. Although these goals are not enforceable, AOM members should consider them in seeking to arrive at ethical courses of action. The Ethical Standards set forth enforceable rules for conduct by AOM members.1 Most of the Ethical Standards are written broadly in order to apply to members in varied roles and activities, and the application of an Ethical Standard may vary de pending on the Academy context. The Ethical Stan dards are not exhaustive. General rules of partici pation also exist at various levels in the Academy a"AOM member(s)" generally refers to members of the Academy of Management as well as to nonmembers par ticipating in AOM activities. (e.g., program submission, manuscript submission, placement, governance activities, etc.). Conduct that this "Code of Ethics" does not specifically ad dress is not necessarily ethical or unethical. Membership in the AOM commits members to uphold the principles of the "AOM Code of Ethics" and to adhere to the enforced ethical standards and the accompanying policies and procedures. Mem bers are advised of this obligation upon joining the Academy of Management. Violations of the ethical standards may lead to the imposition of sanctions, including termination of membership. PREAMBLE The Academy of Management is devoted to in creasing scientific and professional knowledge of management practices. It promotes the use of such knowledge to improve the work lives of individu als, the efficiency and effectiveness of organiza tions, and the well-being of society as a whole. The AOM ensures that attention is paid to the rights and well-being of all organizational stakeholders. AOM members respect and protect civil and hu man rights and the central importance of freedom of inquiry and expression in research, teaching, and publication. They seek to help managers, em ployers, and public officials develop informed judgments and choices concerning the impact of business practices on individual employees and society, both nationally and globally. In doing so, AOM members perform many roles, acting as re searchers, teachers, consultants, diagnosticians, su pervisors, administrators, commentators, and so cial interventionists. AOM members realize that to maintain ethical standards they must make a per sonal, lifelong commitment to behaving ethically themselves; to encouraging students, supervisees, employees, employers, and colleagues to behave ethically; and to consulting with others when eth ical questions arise. GENERAL PRINCIPLES These general principles are aspirations and serve as a guide for AOM members in determining ethical courses of action in various contexts. They exemplify the highest ideals of professional con duct and are intended to challenge members to the highest ethical ideals of the profession. _1540_ Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Responsibility AOM members establish relationships of trust with those with whom they work (students, col leagues, administrators, clients). They are aware of their professional and scientific responsibilities to society and to the specific communities in which they work. AOM members uphold professional standards of conduct, clarify their professional roles and obligations, accept appropriate responsi bility for their behavior, and seek to manage con flicts of interest that could lead to exploitation or harm. They are concerned about the ethicality of their colleagues' scientific, educational, and profes sional conduct. They strive to contribute portions of their professional time for little or no compen sation or personal advantage. 2. Integrity AOM members seek to promote accuracy, hon esty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of their profession. In these activities AOM members do not steal, cheat, or engage in fraud, subterfuge, or intentional misrepresentation of fact. They strive to keep their promises, to avoid unwise or unclear commitments, and to reach for excel lence in teaching, scholarship, and practice. They treat students, colleagues, research subjects, and clients with respect, dignity, fairness, and caring. They accurately and fairly represent their areas and degrees of expertise. 3. Respect for People's Rights and Dignity AOM members respect the dignity and worth of all people and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination. AOM members are aware of and respect cultural, individ ual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, na tional origin, religion, sexual orientation, disabil ity, language, and socioeconomic status, and they consider these factors when working with all peo ple. AOM members try to eliminate the effect on their work of biases based on these factors, and they do not knowingly participate in or condone activi ties of others based upon such prejudices. The AOM and its members are also committeji to pro viding academic and professional work environ ments that are free of sexual harassment and all forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation. PROFESSIONAL PRINCIPLES Our professional goals are to enhance the learn ing of students and colleagues and the effectiveness of organizations through our teaching, research, and practice of management. We have five major responsibilities: 1. To our students. Relationships with students require respect, fairness, and caring, along with commitment to our subject matter and to teaching excellence. We accomplish these aims by: Striving for teaching excellence. It is the duty of AOM members who are educators to maintain current knowledge of their fields; to devote suf ficient time to preparation, classroom communi cation, and timely grading; and to sensitize stu dents to the ethical dimensions of management. Showing respect for students. It is the duty of AOM members who are educators to show ap propriate respect for students' feelings, interests, needs, contributions, intellectual freedom, and rights to privacy. Maintaining objectivity and fairness. It is the duty of AOM members who are educators to treat students equitably. Impartiality, objectivity, and fairness are required in all dealings with students. Counseling students. It is the duty of AOM mem bers to be helpful and sensitive in counseling students. 2. To the advancement of managerial knowl edge. Prudence in research design, human subject use, and confidentiality and reporting of results is essential. Proper attribution of work is a necessity. We accomplish these aims through: Conducting and reporting. It is the duty of AOM members conducting research to design, imple ment, analyze, report, and present their findings rigorously. Planning and implementation. It is the duty of AOM members to minimize the possibility that results will be misleading and, when possible, to consult with experts or authoritative bodies on the ethics of research if a practice is unclear. Participants. It is the duty of AOM members to preserve and protect the privacy, dignity, well being, and freedom of research participants. Dissemination. It is the duty of journal editors and reviewers to exercise the privilege of their positions in a confidential, unbiased, prompt, constructive, and sensitive manner. Grants and contracts. It is the duty of AOM mem bers to represent themselves and their proposed</page><page sequence="3">1542 Academy of Management Journal December projects accurately, and to manage those projects as promised. 3. To the Academy of Management and the larger professional environment. Support of the AOM's mission and objectives, service to the AOM and its institutions, and recognition of the dignity and personal worth of colleagues are required. We accomplish these aims through: Sharing and dissemination of information. To encourage meaningful exchange, AOM members should foster a climate of free interchange and constructive criticism within the AOM and should be willing to share research findings and insights fully with other members. Academy participation. The AOM is a voluntary association whose existence and operations de pend on cooperation, involvement, and leader ship from its members. Commitment to professional standards of con duct. By this Code, the AOM provides ongoing ethical guidance for its members. Strengthening and renewal of the Academy. The AOM must have continuous infusions of mem bers and new points of view to remain viable and relevant as a professional association. Membership in the professional community. It is the duty of AOM members to interact with others in our community in a manner that recognizes individual dignity and merit. 4. To both managers and the practice of man agement. Exchange of ideas and information be tween the academic and organizational communi ties is essential. Consulting with client organizations ("clients") has potential for enriching the teaching and practice of management, for trans lating theory into practice, and for furthering re search and community service. To maximize such potential benefits, it is essential that members who consult be guided by the ideals of competence, integrity, and objectivity. We accomplish these aims through: Credentials and capabilities. It is the duty of consultants to represent their credentials and ca pabilities in an accurate and objective manner. Obligations to clients. Consultants have a duty to fulfill their obligations to their present and pro spective clients in a professionally responsible and timely manner. Client relations. Consultants must fulfill duties of confidentiality and efficiency as part of their relationships with their clients. Remuneration. It is the duty of consultants to negotiate clear and mutually accepted remuner ation agreements for their services. Societal responsibilities. Consultants have a duty to uphold the legal and moral obligations of the society in which they function. Consultants should report to the appropriate authorities any unlawful activities that may have been uncov ered during the course of their consulting en gagements (except where their functional or pro fessional codes direct otherwise). 5. To all people with whom we live and work in the world community. Sensitivity to other people, to diverse cultures, to the needs of the poor and disadvantaged, to ethical issues, and to newly emerging ethical dilemmas is required. We accom plish this aim through: Worldview. Academy members have a duty to consider their responsibilities to the world com munity. In their role as educators, members of the Academy can play a vital role in encouraging a broader horizon for decision making by view ing issues from a multiplicity of perspectives, including the perspectives of those who are the least advantaged. ETHICAL STANDARDS These are enforceable standards of conduct ap plying to members in official Academy roles and members and nonmembers participating in Acade my-sponsored activities. The Academy of Manage ment is an association whose existence and opera tions depend on cooperation, involvement, and leadership from its members. AOM members ad here to the highest ethical standards when interact ing with others in the association, participating in AOM activities, and assuming official roles. Mem bers also abide by the rules and policies pertaining to the specific AOM activities they engage in (e.g., program submission, division bylaws, board re quirements, etc.). 1. Human Relations 1.1. Unfair Discrimination: AOM members do not engage in unfair discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, eth nicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, socioeco nomic status, or any basis proscribed by law. 1.2. Sexual Harassment: AOM members do not engage in sexual harassment. Sexual ha</page><page sequence="4">2007 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1543 rassment is sexual solicitation, physical ad vances, or verbal or nonverbal conduct that is sexual in nature, occurs in connection with the member's Academy activities, and either: (1) is unwelcome, is offensive, or creates a hostile environment, and the member knows or is told this; or (2) is suf ficiently severe or intense as to be deemed abusive by a reasonable person in the con text. Sexual harassment can consist of a single intense or severe act or of multiple persistent or pervasive acts. 1.3. Other Harassment: AOM members do not knowingly engage in behavior that is ha rassing or demeaning to others with whom they interact, including behavior con ducted electronically (e.g., spamming, spoofing, mail-bombing, etc.). 1.4. Avoiding Harm: AOM members take rea sonable steps to avoid harming others with whom they interact and to minimize harm where it is foreseeable and unavoidable. 1.5. Conflicts of Interest: AOM members take appropriate steps to avoid conflicts of inter est or the appearance of conflicts. 1.5.1. Roles. AOM members refrain from assuming roles in which their inter ests or relationships could reason ably be expected to: (1) impair their objectivity, competence, or effective ness; or (2) expose the persons or organizations with whom the rela tionships exist to harm or exploitation. 1.5.2. Disclosure. AOM members disclose relevant information and personal or professional relationships that may have the appearance of or potential for a conflict of interest. 1.5.3. Decision making. AOM members carefully assess their potential for bias when making decisions affect ing those with whom they have had strong conflicts or disagreements. 1.6. Exploitative Relationships: AOM members do not exploit persons over whom they have evaluative or other authority, such as authors, job seekers, or student members. 1.7. Informed Consent: When AOM members conduct research, including on behalf of the AOM or its divisions, they obtain the informed consent of the individual or indi viduals, using language that is reasonably understandable to that person or persons. Written or oral consent, permission, and assent are documented appropriately. 1.8. Fiduciary Responsibility: 1.8.1. AOM best interests. Members in offi cial AOM roles (e.g., chairs, board members, division officers) act in a manner that is trustworthy and that inspires confidence that the mem bers are acting in the AOM's best interest. 1.8.2. Duty of accounting. Members who receive or handle AOM funds pro vide a true accounting of the money and/or property entrusted to them and do not cheat, steal, misappropri ate AOM resources, or circumvent AOM financial policies. 1.8.3. Personal gain. Members in official AOM roles do not receive compensa tion, gifts, or other special consider ation in return for the promise of AOM business. 2. Privacy and Confidentiality AOM members have an obligation to ensure the protection of confidential information. When gath ering confidential information, AOM members should take into account the long-term uses of the information, including its potential placement in public archives or the examination of the informa tion by others. 2.1. Maintaining Confidentiality: 2.1.1. AOM members take reasonable pre cautions to protect the confidential ity rights of others. 2.1.2. Confidential information is treated as such even if it lacks legal protec tion or privilege. 2.1.3. AOM members maintain the integ rity of confidential deliberations, ac tivities, or roles, including, where applicable, those of committees, re view panels, or advisory groups (e.g., the AOM Placement Committee, the AOM Ethics Adjudication Commit tee, etc.). 2.1.4. When using private information, AOM members protect the confiden tiality of individually identifiable in</page><page sequence="5">1544 Academy of Management Journal December formation. Information is private when an individual (e.g., an AOM scholarship applicant) can reason ably expect that the information will not be made public with personal identifiers. 2.2. Avoidance of Personal Gain: 2.2.1. Under all circumstances, AOM mem bers do not use or otherwise seek to gain from information or material re ceived in a confidential context (e.g., knowledge obtained from reviewing a manuscript or serving on a pro posal review panel), unless they * have authorization to do so or that information is otherwise made pub licly available. 2.3. Limits of Confidentiality: 2.3.1. AOM members determine their abil ity to guarantee absolute confidenti ality at the outset and, as appropri ate, inform others of (1) the relevant limitations on confidentiality and (2) the foreseeable uses of the informa tion generated. 2.3.2. AOM members may confront unan ticipated circumstances where they become aware of information that is clearly threatening to others. In these cases, AOM members balance the importance of guarantees of confi dentiality with other principles in this "Code of Ethics," ethical con duct, and applicable law. 2.3.3. Confidentiality is not required with respect to observations in public places, activities conducted in pub lic, or other settings where no rules of privacy are provided by law or by custom. Similarly, confidentiality is not required in the case of informa tion available from public records. 2.4. Anticipation of Possible Uses of Information: 2.4.1. When maintaining or accessing per sonal identifiers in databases or sys tems of records, such as division ros ters, annual meeting submissions, or manuscript review systems, AOM members delete such identifiers be fore the information is made publicly available or employ other techniques that mask or control disclosure of in dividual identities. 2.4.2. When deletion of personal identifi ers is not feasible, AOM members take reasonable steps to determine that the appropriate consent of per sonally identifiable individuals has been obtained before they transfer such data to others or review such data collected by others. 2.5. Electronic Transmission of Confidential In formation: AOM members use extreme care in delivering or transferring any confiden tial data, information, or communication over public computer networks when con ducting AOM work. AOM members are at tentive to the problems of maintaining con fidentiality and control over sensitive material and data when the use of techno logical innovations, such as public com puter networks, may open their communi cation to unauthorized persons. 3. Public Statements 3.1. AOM members do not make public state ments, of any kind, that are false, deceptive, misleading, or fraudulent, either because of what they state, convey, or suggest or be cause of what they omit, including, but not limited to, false or deceptive statements concerning other AOM members. 3.2. When, at the request of the association, AOM members provide public comment on behalf of AOM, they take reasonable pre cautions to ensure that: (1) the statements are based on appropriate research, litera ture, and practice, (2) the AOM is credited, and (3) the statements are otherwise consis tent with this "Code of Ethics." 3.3. AOM members do not speak for or repre sent the AOM unless authorized by its pres ident to do so. 4. Research and Publication 4.1. Reporting on Research: AOM members ad here to the highest ethical standards when disseminating their research findings, such as at the annual meeting or in AOM publications. 4.1.1. AOM members do not fabricate data or falsify results in their publications or presentations.</page><page sequence="6">2007 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1545 4.1.2. In presenting their work, AOM mem bers report their findings fully and do not omit data that are relevant within the context of the research question(s). They report results whether they support or contradict expected outcomes. 4.1.3. AOM members take particular care to present relevant qualifications to their research or to the findings and interpretations of their research. AOM members also disclose under lying assumptions, theories, meth ods, measures, and research designs that are relevant to the findings and interpretations of their work. 4.1.4. In keeping with the spirit of full dis closure of methods and analyses, once findings are publicly dissemi nated, AOM members permit their open assessment and verification by other responsible researchers, with appropriate safeguards, where appli cable, to protect the anonymity of re search participants. 4.1.5. If AOM members discover signifi cant errors in their publication or presentation of data, they take appro priate steps to correct such errors in the form of a correction, retraction, published erratum, or other public statement. 4.1.6. AOM members report sources of fi nancial support in their papers and note any special relations to any sponsor. AOM members may with hold the names of specific sponsors if they provide an adequate and full description of the sponsors' nature and interest. 4.1.7. AOM members report accurately the results of others' scholarship by us ing complete and correct information and citations when presenting the work of others. 4.1.8. AOM members who analyze data from others explicitly acknowledge the contribution of the initial researchers. 4.2. Publication Process: AOM members adhere to the highest ethical standards when par ticipating in publication and review processes. 4.2.1. Plagiarism 4.2.1.1. AOM members explicitly identify, credit, and refer ence the author of any data or material taken verbatim from written work, whether that work is published, un published, or electronically available. 4.2.1.2. AOM members explicitly cite others' work and ideas, including their own, even if the work or ideas are not quoted verbatim or para phrased. This standard ap plies whether the previous work is published, unpub lished, or electronically available. 4.2.2. Authorship Credit 4.2.2.1. AOM members ensure that authorship and other publi cation credits are based on the scientific or professional contributions of the individ uals involved. 4.2.2.2. AOM members take respon sibility and credit, including authorship credit, only for work they have actually per formed or to which they have contributed. 4.2.2.3. AOM members usually list a student as principal author on multiply authored publi cations that substantially de rive from the student's dis sertation or thesis. 4.2.3. Submission of Manuscripts for Publication 4.2.3.1. In cases of multiple author ship, AOM members confer with all other authors prior to submitting work for pub lication, and they establish mutually acceptable agree ments regarding submission. 4.2.3.2. In submitting a manuscript to an AOM publication, members grant that publica tion first claim to publica tion, except where explicit</page><page sequence="7">1546 Academy of Management Journal December policies allow multiple submissions. 4.2.3.3. It is AOM policy to permit the authors of manuscripts that have been previously published in any proceed ings to submit substantially embellished manuscripts for AOM journal review. 4.2.3.4. AOM members may not sub mit a manuscript to a second publication until after a de cision has been received from the first publication or until the authors have for mally withdrawn the manu script. AOM members sub mitting a manuscript for publication in a journal, book series, or edited book can withdraw a manuscript from consideration up until an official acceptance is made. 4.2.3.5. When AOM members pub lish data or findings that overlap with work they have previously published else where, they cite these publi cations. AOM members must also send the prior publication or in-press work to the AOM journal editor to whom they are submitting their work. 4.2.4. Responsibilities of Editors 4.2.4.1. When serving as editors of journals, books, or other publications, AOM mem bers are fair in the applica tion of academic publishing standards, and they operate without personal or ideolog ical favoritism or malice. As editors, AOM members are cognizant of any potential conflicts of interest. 4.2.4.2. When serving as editors of journals or book series, AOM members ensure the confidentiality of the review process and supervise edito rial office staff, including stu dents, in accordance with practices that maintain confidentiality. 4.2.4.3. When serving as editors of journals or book series, AOM members are bound to publish all manuscripts ac cepted for publication un less major errors or ethical violations are discovered af ter acceptance (e.g., plagia rism or scientific misconduct). 4.2.4.4. When serving as editors of journals or book series, AOM members ensure the anonymity of reviewers un less they receive permission from reviewers to reveal their identities. Editors en sure that their staff members conform to this practice. 4.2.4.5. When serving as journal ed itors, AOM members ensure the anonymity of authors unless and until a manu script is accepted for publi cation, or unless the estab lished practices of the journal are known to be otherwise. 4.2.4.6. When serving as journal edi tors, AOM members take steps to provide for the timely review of all manuscripts and respond promptly to inquir ies about the status of a review. 4.2.5. Responsibilities of Reviewers 4.2.5.1.

AOM members disclose con flicts of interest or decline requests to review others' work when they are aware of conflicts of interest. 4.2.5.3. AOM members decline re quests for reviews of the work of others when they believe that the review pro</page><page sequence="8">2007 Academy of Management Code of Ethics 1547 cess may be biased or when they have questions about the integrity of the process. 4.2.5.4. If asked to review a manu script, book, or proposal they have previously re viewed, AOM members make that prior review known to the person making the request (e.g., editor, pro gram officer), unless it is clear that they are being asked to provide a reappraisal. 5. Ascribing to the "Code of Ethics" Upon joining the AOM, members agree to up hold and promote the principles of the "AOM Code of Ethics" and to adhere to its enforced ethical standards. 5.1. Familiarity with the "Code of Ethics": AOM members have an obligation to be familiar with this "Code of Ethics." Lack of aware ness or misunderstanding of an ethical standard is not, in itself, a defense to a charge of unethical conduct. 5.2. Confronting Ethical Issues: 5.2.1. When AOM members are uncertain whether a particular situation or course of action might violate the "Code of Ethics," they may consult the AOM's Ethics Ombudsperson. 5.2.2. When AOM members confront tak ing actions or making choices entail ing conflict between ethical stan dards enunciated in the "Code of Ethics" and laws or legal require ments, they make known their com mitment to the "Code" and take steps to resolve the conflict in a responsi ble manner by consulting the AOM's Ethics Ombudsperson. 5.3. Fair Treatment of Parties in Ethical Disputes: 5.3.1. AOM members do not discriminate against a person on the basis of his or her having made an ethical com plaint or having been the subject of an ethical complaint. This consider ation does not preclude taking action based upon the outcome of an ethical complaint. 5.4. Reporting Ethical Violations of Others: When AOM members have substantial rea son to believe that there has been an ethical violation by another AOM member, they attempt to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual. If an infor mal resolution appears appropriate or pos sible, or AOM members seek advice about how to proceed, they may contact the AOM's Ethics Ombudsperson for guidance. 5.5. Cooperating with Ethics Committees: AOM members cooperate in ethics investigations, proceedings, and resulting requirements of the AOM. In doing so, they make reason able efforts to resolve any issues of confi dentiality. Failure to cooperate may be an ethics violation. 5.6. Improper Complaints: AOM members do not file or encourage the filing of ethics complaints that are frivolous and are in tended to harm the alleged violator.</page><page sequence="9">?

An abstract of no more than 100 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved. Contents may not be copied, written permission. Users may print, download or email articles for individual use only. Back Pages Group references and any appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Use bold face for all three. Main headings (all capital letters; centered) are first. Second-level headings (title-style letters; flush left) are next. Third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into paragraph) are next. Don't skip steps: no second-level headings before you use a first-level heading, for instance. Use sec ond- and third-level headings in sets of two or more. Examples: METHODS [1st level] Data and Sample [2nd level] Measures [2nd level] Independent variable. [3rd level] Dependent variables. [3rd level] Footnotes Use footnotes, not endnotes. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number (Hy pothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMffs wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Put quotation marks around the first appearance in your paper of each technical term, or define it. 548 emailed, posted to a listserv, or otherwise transmitted without the copyright holder's express</page><page sequence="10">2007 Style Guide for Authors 1549 Abbreviations. Avoid using them for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a x2 test." Do use symbols and numbers to report results and give formulas. Italicize letters that are custom arily italicized [p, r, b, F, Z, and so forth). Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs, minus signs, etc. Illustrative results within text go in parentheses. Introduce them with complete sentences. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Keep equations in your running text unless they contain oversized symbols or division, and/or are very important in your research. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? [e-kixt)\(Xtrj Pr(Yt = ytxt) =-W!-, (1) where Yt is. . . . Define each new term in all equations. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating. Do not use "he" or "she" exclusively. Using the plural? changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"?is one solution; using "he or she" ("him or her") is another. Active voice and first person. Write in the active voice ("They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author developed three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Do not describe inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Be concise. Avoid exact reproductions of surveys. Label appendixes "APPENDIX A," "APPENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within ap pendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to see preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and boldface, but in upper- and lower-case letters. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place them at the end of your manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure needs an introductory sentence in your text. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type. Don't use code names and abbrevi ations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left cor ners of their tables.</page><page sequence="11">1550 Academy of Management Journal December Use superscript small letters to designate table footnotes. A lettered footnote may be used to sum marize significance levels: a All values greater than ... are significant at. . . . Or report significance levels in separate footnotes placed in a stack under your regular table footnotes. Example: tp &lt; .10 *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 More on figures. Figures, unlike tables, have graphics. Make sure your figures will print out clearly so that they can be scanned. Do not use color. Use the same full variable names you use in your text and tables. Citations These are your in-text, in parentheses, identifi cations of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a corresponding reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bern stein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) support this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) presented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example above. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation? (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation?(Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers in citations. Use this format: Writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (Lee, 1998: 3). Citation with no author. For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an increase in service jobs [Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an increase in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Depart ment of Commerce, 1992). Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. Industrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Com merce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first.

ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS: BRINGING MEANING, CULTURE, AND VALUES BACK IN Guest Editors: Roy Suddaby, Kim Eisbach, Royston Greenwood, John Meyer, and Tammar B. Zilber Since Meyer and Rowan's (1977) classic paper, much research has focused on how organizations adapt to institutional pressures. Research in this tradition has shifted from an early focus on ex plaining organizational similarity, to a more recent emphasis on how institutional pressures affect or ganizational change. Although this research has generated an impressive volume of work, the "new" institutionalism has been criticized because "it does not have the guts of institutions in it" (Stinchcombe, 1997: 17). That is, most research focuses on how the institutional environment af fects organizational form and function, without also attending to the values, beliefs, and meanings that underpin form and function. The "guts of in stitutions" is the understanding that institutional pressures only work because they impact the col lective understandings and commitments of indi viduals inside both organizations and institutions. Our goal in this special research forum, thus, is to understand how social structures and practices in side organizations "acquire meaning and stability in their own right rather than as instrumental tools for the achievement of specialized ends" (Lincoln, 1995: 1147). We invite papers that explicitly exam ine the phenomenological underpinnings of insti tutions inside organizations. Our aims are threefold: First, we aim to examine the ideational dynamics of meaning, culture, symbols and values in or ganizations. We explicitly encourage studies that extend recent efforts to explore the role of mean ing (Zilber, 2002), symbols (Creed, Scully, &amp; Austen, 2002), and values (Greenwood &amp; Hin ings, 1996) that explain how organizational prac tices acquire meaning and significance beyond their immediate productive value. Second, we hope to reconnect institutional re search with processes that occur inside organi zations. While we now know how institutional pressures influence interorganizational relations and structure organizational fields, considerably less attention has been paid to understanding how logics, fads, and fashions and other macro pressures are interpreted by actors inside organ izations. We encourage here an extension of the tradition established by Gouldner (1954) and Selznick (1949) that examines how the infusion of values and meanings can subvert rationality and agency to produce unanticipated conse quences in organizations. Third, we emphasize the need to extend the range of methodological tools used to study the effects of meanings, culture, and values in organ izations. We seek papers that employ interpre tive methods that focus on how "different mean ings held by different persons or groups produce or sustain a sense of truth, particularly in the face of competing definitions of reality" (Gephart, 2004: 457). We encourage papers that employ case histories, interviews, ethnographies, ethno statistics, grounded theory, sense-making, conver sational analysis, narrative, semiotics, content analysis, rhetoric, and other underrepresented methodologies. Prospective contributors may wish to consider (but are not limited to) the following research questions: What are the motivations of organizations that adopt highly institutionalized practices? Are the espoused motivations for adopting TQM, for ex ample, expressed in terms of the need to conform or the need to improve performance? How is the adoption of management fads and fashions con tested inside organizations? How are institutional logics understood by actors inside organizations? How do actors reconcile competing logics? How, for example, are debates over the adoption of corporate social responsi bility framed by different constituents inside an organization; are they framed in terms of moral ity or share performance? Why do organizations engage in practices that have no discernible relationship with technical efficiency? Why do for-profit corporations col 1552 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Why do they construct corporate histo ries? How are such practices framed by manage ment? How are they understood by employees? What persuasive techniques are used by manage ment to convince shareholders that adoption is in their interests? How are institutional categories constructed and given meaning? What boundary work goes into creating categories that define access to eco nomic and institutional resources? How, for ex ample, does the creation of such categories as "technology," "affirmative action," or "human resources" construct actors and confer differen tial access to resources within organizations? What boundary work goes into expanding or contracting such categories? What is the cultural basis of management? What core values make popular management parables more credible than empirical research among practitioners? What are the key ceremonial and ritualistic elements of leadership or management that offer purpose and meaning beyond bare claims to legitimacy? How are the ceremonial elements of organizations (i.e., annual meetings, letters to shareholders) interpreted by various audiences? In sum, we are interested in bringing meaning, culture and values back into institutional theory and institutional processes back inside organi zations as a way to deepen our understanding of how institutional pressures shape organizational behavior.

Meyer Jeffrey Pfeffer Coming Soon Fall 2007 This exciting new series follows one guiding principle: The advancement of knowledge is possible only by conducting a thorough examination of what is known and unknown in a given field. Such assess ments can be accomplished through comprehensive, critical reviews of the literature?crafted by informed scholars who determine when a line of inquiry has gone off track, and how to steer the research back onto the proper path. The Academy of Management Annals provide just such essential reviews. Written by leading management schol ars, the reviews are invaluable for ensuring the timeliness of advanced courses, for designing new investiga tive approaches, and for identifying faulty methodological or conceptual assumptions. The Annals strive each year to synthesize a vast array of primary research, recognizing past principal contributions while illu minating potential future avenues of inquiry. Volume 1 of the Annals explores a wide spectrum of research: corporate control; nonstandard employment; critical management; physical work environments; public administration team learning; emotions in organi zations; leadership and health care; creativity at work; business and the environment; and bias in perform ance appraisals. The inaugural volume of the Academy of Management Annals will be available in the Fall of 2007. The AOM Annals will be available to AOM members at a discounted rate of 40% off the list price.
