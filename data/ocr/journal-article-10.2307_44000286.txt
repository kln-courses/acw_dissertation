<plain_text><page sequence="1">A METAPHYSICAL APPROACH TO THE EXISTENCE OF GOD Because the present-day world is so complex and so changing, it is an obvious impossibility to describe it both accurately and adequately. The structure of society is being altered by scientific, economic, social and intellectual innovations which are creating both amazing progress and deep disorders. This paradoxical situation is reflected in the prevalent attitudes, ideas and values concerning man's relationship with God. These present-day, paradoxical atti- tudes indicate two seemingly opposed characteristics, a loss of the sense of God and a restless striving to know God. In many respects the modern world appears to be a closed system in which God, as the center of that world, has been replaced by man, who is able to exploit and dominate that world. "If there is any one feature of our contemporary crisis which distinguishes it from those of preceding civilizations, it would seem to be the chronic, almost universal loss of the sense of God." 1 This almost universal loss of the sense of God in the present-day world is no simple phenom- enon which exhibits a single, clearly defined cause. Rather, it is the result of varied, complex and intertwining social, historical and cultural situations. Paradoxically, modern society also reveals a striving and a longing that is clearly a search for God. Not just in spite of the loss of the sense of God in our era, but often because of this loss, the problem of the existence of God has been revitalized. At a time when the absence of God is so widespread, the theme of His existence and of His relationship with the world is found to be central in many of the books, articles, motion pictures and plays of contemporary society. All of this contemporary interest in the question of God implies at least reluctant recognition of the very Reality which man seems intent on denying. Gabriel Marcel has maintained that it "might 1 Gleason, R. W. The Search for God (New York, 1964), p. 5.</page><page sequence="2">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 89 even be that the current rebellion against God could become the initial act in purifying our dialectic, the negative starting-po int of a thought capable of orienting itself toward God in the end."2 The mo- dern attitude of this loss of a sense of God is able to provide an oppor- tunity to do away with a conception of God that is false, misleading and, therefore, totally inadequate. This modern denial of God is able to be seen as an efficacious criticism of outmoded, inadequate and anthropomorphic representations of the Divine Reality and thereby as a purifying element in seeking a true, yet of necessity an obscure, knowledge of God. Henri De Lubac maintains that "modern civili- zations expose us to the risk of losing God. Perhaps they will enable us to rediscover him at a deeper level..." 3. This seeking for God, this searching for the affirmation of the. existence of the Divine Reality is often referred to as the "problem of God," especially in the vast number of philosophical-theological books and articles that have been published in the past few years. This is not to say that the problem of God is a limited study of a specified philosophical nature. Rather, "rightly understood, the problem of God is not one problem among several others ; it is the only problem there is." 4 Indeed, "many thinkers are of the opinion that the problem of God... constitutes the essence of the problem of our own time." 5 This essence of the problem for our time has brought a special urgency to the situation, so much so that Robert Kreyche is able to claim that "Few problems are as urgent as the 'problem1 of God in society." 6 The problem of God is not merely a problem of philosophy, it is also a problem of absorbing human interest since it concerns the total existence of man. Obviously, a study of this total problem of God is far beyond the scope of this article. This article will confine itself to only the philosophical aspect of this problem, that is whether philosophy as "the science in which natural reason seeks an understanding of all things by a knowledge of their first principles" 7 is able to arrive at the affirmation that the Divine Reality does exist. This limitation 2 Marcel, G. " Contemporary Atheism and the Religious Mind, " Philos- ophy Today , IV, i960, p. 256. 3 De Lubac, H. The Discovery of God (London, i960), p. 181. 4 Ogden, S. M.

KEHEW of our study is in no way a disparagement of the importance of the other aspects of this problem, rather it is a necessary limitation in order to scientifically approach and appreciate this all-important aspect of the total problem. Before presenting an evaluation of an attempt at answering this question, it is necessary to justify the legitimacy of such a philoso- phical approach in the face of widely differing challenges. There are many who maintain that unaided reason is unable to arrive at a certain knowledge of the existence of the Divine Reality. Some present-day theologians (for example, Karl Barth) em- phatically deny the validity of any philosophical knowledge of God because of the complete otherness of the nature of God. Although this position is understandable enough if one considers the many exaggerations of the past, this reason only does not justify such an extreme position. Even though a philosophical knowledge of God is possible, it is in fact attained only with great difficulty and with far less than a ' 'total' ' knowledge of God as a result. Others object to this type of knowledge because of the contra- dictions that are so evident concerning this question in the long history of philosophy. Without doubt, the history of philosophy does show imperfect and conflicting notions of God, but is this not itself an indication of the profundity and mystery of the Divine Reality ? There are others, having been trained in positivistic, scientific disciplines, who are disconcerted by metaphysical activities, because they fail to find within metaphysics their criteria of certainty. We would be the first to maintain that metaphysical certitude belongs to another order than positive scientific certitude. Because of this difference, the same criteria of evidence are not able to be applied to these widely differing sciences. Finally, many philosophers, influenced by the prevalence of linguistic analysis, maintain that the existence of God is not a ques- tion for the philosopher qua philosopher to decide, because the philosopher is not called upon to reason to the existence of God. Rather, they contend that what ...the philosopher is called upon to do is to ask those who believe in God to describe as accurately as they can how they think and speak of Him, so that he may try to find some method of determining the exact logical status of the kinds of statement about God believers make. 8 8 Siliem, E. Ways of Thinking About God (New York, 1961), p. 1.</page><page sequence="4">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 91 The only response possible to such an understanding of the task of philosophy is to restate the definition of the science of philosophy that was just given. We see the task of philosophy in an entirely different perspective than do the followers of the school of linguistic analysis. We maintain that it is false to base the entire task of phi- losophy on the principle of verification, because to do so is to stretch its range of application beyond all reasonable limits. We contend, in contrast to the number of objections above, that the problem of the existence of God is posed by the very demands of philosophy itself. The central metaphysical problem is to under- stand the nature and origin of finite beings and it is the existence of God that appears as its final and adequate solution. We recognize that such an approach to God's existence is always achieved me- diately, because the Divine Reality is not the immediate object of the intellect. Our knowledge of God comes to us through our knowl- edge of the sensible world, not through any natural intuition of God. The capacities and the limitations of human reason must be continually remembered, since the two extremes of agnosticism and rationalism are always to be avoided. Our goal is a perfectly bal- anced equilibrium between the two - the awareness that reason can indeed arrive at a secure knowledge of the existence of God, but that this knowledge is not a complete grasp of the Divine Reality, since everything we can say of Him is necessarily inadequate. This situation has prompted many modern thinkers to say that all knowledge is dialectical, that is, all statements about Him imply their opposite. This reflection is similar to Saint Thomas' teaching that all that is said of God must also be denied, that negative the- ology is the necessary complement of positive theology. God is both known and unknown to us. He is known in that we can determine the truth of certain propositions about Him in an experiential- inferential way ; this removes the extreme claim of agnosticism and of atheism, whether of the emphatic or the unemphatic variety. God is unknown in that none of the finite things from which we draw our knowledge gives us a vision of His divine being in its own infinite ac- tuality ; this removes the extreme claim of the functionalists and dia- lectical monists, the ontologists and theosophists. 9 This article is an attempt to present an evaluation of a con- temporary Thomistic approach to the philosophical affirmation of the existence of God. 9 Collins, J. God in Modern Philosophy (Chicago, 1959), p. 402.</page><page sequence="5">92 DONALD R. KEHEW An evaluation of the work of The Reverend Thomas C. O'Brien, an American Dominican priest, is the core of this article, not be- cause of any reputation that he has as an original philosopher, but rather because his work is representative of the school of philosophy called Thomism. In i960 Father O'Brien authored a book entitled Metaphysics and the Existence of God , the first volume of a series of texts and studies in Thomism initiated by the Thomistic Press of Washington, D.C. Father O'Brien has shown, in the first part of his study, that the supposed monolithic structure of Thomism is really a group of surprisingly divergent views and opinions on such ques- tions as the place of the question of God's existence in philosophy, the use of a nominal definition of God as a vehicle of approach to the establishment of His existence and the use of the famous "quin- qué viae" of the Summa theologiae of Saint Thomas. Although ad- mitting that dispute and discussion is a normal sign of philosophy's vitality, Father O'Brien finds the disconcerting element in this di- vergence in the fact that each opinion is advanced with the claim of Thomistic authenticity and of fidelity to the thought of Saint Thomas. Father O'Brien states : The term " Thomistic Philosophy " itself admits of at least a duality of senses. Taken in its intrinsic nature, Thomistic philosophy should bespeak human wisdom as constituted in its systematic totality by principles formulated, developed or inspired by St. Thomas Aquinas. But Thomistic philosophy may also be understood as an historic reality, since as an intellectual perfection it can only reside in the minds of Thomistic philosophers. Nor is the residence a mere passive homage paid to authority ; the philosopher designating himself Thomistic does so on the sole grouds of his own assimilation of, and rationally convinced assent to, the thought of his master. Thomistic philosophy in this con- crete sense lies open to a wide diversity of interpretation. While St. Thomas left no "Summa Philosophiae" as a record of the philosophical system that is distinctively his, the variety of interpretations is not primarily due to this fact. Rather it is the necessarily personal assimi- lation of his thought by Thomistic philosophers that must be recognized as a source of confusion. The philosopher must by convinction make that philosophy he embraces his own. When Thomists present teachings that are drastically incompatible as Thomistic,... then discernment be- tween the content which is truly Thomistic and that which results from the historical or doctrinal conditions personally affecting the proponents of such teachings is demanded. 10 10 O'Brien, T. C. Metaphysics and the Existence of God (Washington, i960), p. 3.</page><page sequence="6">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 93 Father O'Brien considers his work to be such a discernment, with the desired result that the authentic Thomistic meaning of the question is distinguished from the ambiguities arising from historical influences and personal commitments inherent in the interpretations of individual Thomistic philosophers. In the second part of his study, the reflective and critical exam- ination of these theses takes place. He offers in this part a clear exposition of authentically Thomistic principles of metaphysics. He proposes what he considers to be the authentic Thomistic solution to the posed problem of the existence of God. This solution consists in three predominant themes : (1) the order to be followed in ap- proaching the question of God's existence ; (2) the use of a nominal definition of God in metaphysics ; and (3) the function of the "quin- qué viae" in this science. It is the solution offered by Father O'Brien in this final section that will concern us here, since his work is a clear and methodic presentation of a manner in which contemporary Anglo-Saxon Thomists approach the problem of metaphysics in re- lation to the existence of God. The Thomistic Notion of Metaphysics Father O'Brien, in the introduction of his volume, gives a very brief summary of some of the names by which metaphysics has been designated in philosophical tradition. Such names as "first philos- ophy," "wisdom," "the divine science," or "theology" have been employed. In the scholastic tradition, however, "the name meta- physics has been accepted as signifying the science of being as being... Metaphysiscs signifies the science of being 'qua' being and of those things which either as properties or as causes pertain 'per se' to the consideration of being." 11 It is to this area of philosophical knowl- edge that the question of God's existence pertains. Reflection upon the question of God's existence is presented in the order of metaphysics' discovery of the truth. In order to accom- plish this task, metaphysics must exercise its judgment in terms of first principles which eventually lead to the discovery of the truth that God does exist. For a metaphysics to be designated as '"Tho- mistic," it is presupposed that such principles, delineating the nature 11 Ibid., pp. 11-12.</page><page sequence="7">94 DONALD R. KEHEW of metaphysics and its proportion to the truth, are to be sought in the works and words of St. Thomas himself. For the enunciation of these principles, Father O'Brien chooses the text of St. Thomas that he considers to be the clearest and most concise concerning this: The Commentary on Boethius "De Trinitate." These principles are to be found in the fourth article of the fifth question, "Whether divine science (metaphysics) is concerned with those things which are without matter and movement ?" In this article are found the two principles which Father O'Brien uses to find a solution to the problem of God's existence through metaphysics. These two clearly formulated principles are the principle of extension and the principle of limitation. Through the principle of extension, St. Thomas shows that the consideration of God does pertain to that science (meta- physics) whose subject is being as being and it positively attains to the consideration of God as cause of that subject. The knowledge of God is, indeed, the proper end of this science and such an end cor- responds with the natural orientation of the intellect to all being. The negative aspect of this study is provided by the principle of limitation. By this principle it is shown that this science considers God not as its subject, but as principle of its subject, i.e. God con- sidered exclusively as the cause of its subject. Once these principles have been explained, Father O'Brien then uses them to elaborate a solution in a strictly Thomistic tradition concerning the question of God's existence. The three-fold approach mentioned previously is used for this solution by Father O'Brien ; that is, the order to be followed in approaching the question of God's existence, the use of the nominal definition of God in metaphysics, and the function of the "quinqué viae" in this science. A. The order to be followed in metaphysically approaching the question of God's existence Father O'Brien insists very strongly on the fact that metaphys- ics perfects the reflection upon itself in judgments regarding the attainment of truths within the process of its own scientific discovery. Such judgments are advanced only in the light of those principles which are regulative of the nature of metaphysics. In its search for perfect knowledge of reality, metaphysics must consider the first cause of its subject, being in common. The consideration of God</page><page sequence="8">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 95 as principle of this subject is the only manner of considering Him that falls within the competence of metaphysics. Therefore, it is this position that must guide both the order of metaphysics' approach to the question of God's existence and the judgment asserting the doctrinal place of this question. This judgment asserts this approach by calculating its validity within the process of scientific discovery made by metaphysics as it seeks its end, the perfect knowledge of its proper subject. The focal point for Thomistic considerations of God's existence is question two of the First Part of the Summa Theologiae. This fa- miliar question deals with the proposition "God exists," especially in regard to its evidence, its demonstrability and its demonstration. Yet, concerning this question, it is apparent that St. Thomas locates it carefully within the framework of sacred doctrine, whose principal intention is to develop knowledge concerning God. This question of God's existence is dealt with in the part which considers God in Himself, and specifically in connection with the treatment of the divine essence. Therefore, from its context in the Summa, question two is properly a theological question concerning theology's proper subject, God. Father O'Brien also maintains that the theological character of the question is apparent from the origin of the question, as itis proposed in article one. Such a question as that of article one, concerning the self-evidence of God's existence, could never occur at the outset of any purely philosophical investigation, rooted as it is for its material in what is available from the sensible order. There is no experience that warrants a question about the objective immediacy, the self- evidence of a thing's existence. However, for the theologian, con- cerned as he is with the data of revelation, the existence of God is a fact. Concerning the theologian's proper function regarding this truth, the manifestation of how it is true is his concern. The theo- logian must determine that rational demonstrations are neither superfluous nor impossible ; rather, he must seek to advance such demonstrations. Not only does the origin of the question make clear the theo- logical character of the question, but the mode of procedure also does so. The reasons for the need and the possibility of demon- strating God's existence, as advanced by St. Thomas in articles one and two, would be indeed incongruous in a purely philosophical consideration.</page><page sequence="9">96 DONALD R. KEHEW The need to demonstrate God's existence is established because the objective self-evidence, by reason of identity of essence and existence in God, is not available to human reason. The possibility of such a demonstration, " a posteriori, " relies upon the truth that, since God is the Creator, His effects are available to lead to His existence as their cause. A purely philosophical search into God's existence could hardly employ such truths in order to prepare the way for the demonstration of that existence. 32 To the theologian, however, such a procedure is entirely in accord with the nature and with the method of sacred doctrine, since its principles are revealed and its dominion extends over all natural truths, which he is able to judge and employ in the manifestation of truths concerning its proper subject, God. Thus, Father O'Brien insists that the theology of St. Thomas, consonant with the proper theological order, begins with the con- sideration of God Himself and then deals with the truth that God exists, according to the demonstrability of this truth to the human mind. However, for metaphysics to use this order and process con- cerning the question of God's existence is to abandon its only justi- fiable procedure and to assume the privileged point of view of the- ology. To do this is to appropriate a power and dignity that belongs only to theology, which has God as its subject and revealed truths as its principles. For metaphysics to assume the proposition "God exists" as a prob- lem to be dealt with in the way that it is developed in the Summa, demands the use of truths not yet available to metaphysics, as is clear from the implications of the theological process. For metaphysics so to proceed is to cease to be philosophy. 13 In rejecting this approach for metaphysics, Father O'Brien insists that, from beginning to end, metaphysics has as its subject being in common. Therefore, the knowledge about God that meta- physics attains is a knowledge of being in terms of its first cause. To assume the order and approach of theology into metaphysics deprives metaphysics of the one authentic way open to it for its fulfillment, the attainment of God, not as subject, but as principle of its subject. 12 Ibid., p. 183. 13 Ibid., p. 185.</page><page sequence="10">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 97 B. The use of the nominal definition of God in Metaphysics Father O'Brien is very strong in his insistence that the use of the nominal definition of God has a real, important place in the theology of St. Thomas, but he rejects with equal vigor its use in metaphysics. The reason Father O'Brien spends considerable time on this aspect of the question is the position of some well-known contem- porary Thomists who maintain that a nominal definition of God is necessary to the metaphysical task. Some of these, who are men- tioned by the author, are : the Reverend Joseph Gredt, O.S.B, (whose nominal definition is "being a se") ; the Reverend R. S. Maquart ("a being greater than the being of the world") ; the Reverend G. Smith, S.J. ("cause of the existence of things") ; Etienne Gilson ("I Am Who am") ; and Canon Fernand Van Steenberghen ("prov- ident Creator of the universe"). It is because of this characteristic of the necessity of the nom- inal definition of God in metaphysics that Father O'Brien presents what he considers to be a more authentically Thomistic line of rea- soning in which he rejects such a usege in metaphysics. The employment of the nominal definition of God in theology is a requisite for a basic intelligibility of terms, a guarantee that every term employed have a . definite and distinctive meaning. The defini- tion is qualified as nominal in that the ontological value or status of the terms is as yet unknown. Concerning the Summa Theologiae , an examination of the function of the nominal definition of God force- fully emphasizes its theological context. All of the elements con- cerning this point are properly theological. Since God is the subject of theology, it is He whose nominal definition is involved. In virtue of the principles of theology, which are revealed truths concerning God, the theologian realizes that a real definition of God is impossible, since God's essence is not properly known ; yet, despite this, there is still the task of demonstrating God's existence. The knowledge that God's effects are available as a medium for demonstration enables the theologian to indicate the function and availability of the nominal definition of God in the demonstration of His existence. By reason of the character of theology itself, then, the theologian makes those determinations concerning the nominal defini- tion of God, which are necessary in order to deal properly with the 7 - Franciscan Studies 19*72</page><page sequence="11">98 DONALD R. KEHEW scientific question, " an sit Deus " (Does God Exist ?), as this can be resolved by a demonstration. 14 Therefore, theology, among all the human sciences, is the most exalted since it has God as its subject and revealed truth as its principles. To fulfill its role as wisdom it has the function of ex- plaining, defending and manifesting these principles. It is against such a background as this that it is necessarily faced with the scien- tific question : Does God exist ? Even though this truth is not im- mediately evident, it is demonstrable. The question is one con- cerning the medium of demonstration, to be found solely among the effects of God, from which the nominal definition is formulated. It is not because God is the first cause that the question of His existence arises. Rather it is because God, the subject of such a science as theology, is the first cause, that the question can be answered de- monstratively, through a medium which is a nominal definition, imposed from God's effects. 15 Father O'Brien shows, however, that in metaphysics the use of the nominal definition of God is not necessary to either the principle of extension or the principle of limitation in metaphysics. The prin- ciple of extension in metaphysics indicates that it must attain the first cause of being in common, which is God, but it does not mean that it must attain God, who is the first cause of being in common. This difference in the point of view is the difference between meta- physics and theology. The principle of limitation governing metaphysics1 attainment of God determines that God must be considered exclusively as prin- ciple of the subject of the science, but not as the subject itself. As has been stated so often, this subject of metaphysics is being in common and it remains so, even as metaphysics approaches its final stage. Metaphysics begins with the knowledge of its proper subject and then seeks to attain with certitude all that necessarily pertains to the subject, that is, all its properties, in the sense in which this term embraces whatever is involved in the total intelligibility of the subject. In the course of this examination, a knowledge of being as limited is attained. This knowledge is the occasion for wonderment, that is, the seeking of the ultimate explanation of being as so limited, 14 Ibid., p. 196. 15 Ibid., p. 198.</page><page sequence="12">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 99 the question of the "propter quid." Therefore, the knowledge of li- mitation, leading to the question of the "proter quid", is the ap- proach of metaphysics to the perfect knowledge of its subject in terms of the ramifications of its dependence upon the first cause. It is in answering the question " propter quid " concerning its subject that metaphysics attains to a knowledge of the first cause. For this task, a nominal definition of God is extrinsic, alien and unnecessary. C. The function of the " quinqué viae " in this science The function of the " quinqué viae " in metaphysics concerns their relevance both to the origin and the resolution of the question " propter quid " concerning the subject of the science, in so far as it manifests limitation. The basic limitation in beings must be dis- covered by metaphysics, and it is the virtue of the " quinqué viae " that they in fact epitomize such varied aspects of limitation found among the concrete existents which metaphysics considers in the light of its proper subject. The aspect of limitation from which the five ways begin is a crucial point in the development of metaphysics. This aspect of limitation is used in the discovery of the real distinc- tion of " esse " and " essentia " which is the sign of the being's de- pendence upon the first cause. The principle St. Thomas uses for this is not found in the " quinqué viae " but rather in his De Ente et Es- sentia. That principle is " Whatever has being (esse) as really distinct from essence is caused by the first cause, which as such is subsistent being. " 16 Father O'Brien maintains that through the realization of the basic aspect of limitation in beings there is established the neces- sary dependence of being as so limited upon subsistent being. This basic aspect of limitation in beings must be discovered by metaphys- ics and the discovery is necessarily " a posteriori, " from more mani- fest aspects of limitations. Father O'Brien insists that it is the virtue of the " quinqué viae " that they epitomize such varied aspects of limitation found among the concrete existents which metaphysics considers in the light of its proper subject. According to Father O'Brien, the ' 'quinqué viae" serve as well to institute the question of the " propter quid " concerning such aspects of limitation. The resolution of this question regarding each of the aspects of limitation from which the " quinqué viae " begin, actually 16 St. Thomas Aquinas. De Ente et Essentia (Rome, 1948), p. 4.</page><page sequence="13">IOO DONALD R. KEHEW leads to the discovery of the ultimate " propter quid " of being itself as limited and thus to the ultimate, " a priori " reason for the real distinction. This function of the " quinqué viae, " therefore, can be judged in so far as their starting point , their processes , and their ter- minations are suitable and relevant to the objective of metaphysics. We will now briefly see how Father O'Brien applies this reasoning to each of the " quinqué viae " individually. The starting point of the five ways shows their suitability to the metaphysical task. All of these ways begin their investigation from the existent order, which is man's proper intellectual environment. They do not proceed, however, merely from fact, but from the for- malities of the facts involved, which formalities are interpreted meta- physically. The first way takes as its proper starting point the actual and evident fact of movement, a direct and manifest instance of the act-potency composition of beings. Those things which are subjects of this movement are actual beings, yet they are subjects of movements because of the potency in them. This is true whether the movement be in the substantial order (generation) or in the ac- cidental order (alteration as to quality, augmentation as to quantity, or local motion as to place). Therefore, beginning with the fact of movement, the first way manifests a most universal aspect of the act-potency composition among beings of experience. This leads logically to a causal investigation. The other four ways follow a similar path. The second way proceeds from the character of efficient causality. The formal aspect of the efficient cause is its efficacy, the efficiency by which it pro- duces an effect. In the order of efficient causes, one cause is the cause of the other's causing and therefore the aspect of limitation is found in the very exercise of efficiency. The third way begins with possible and necessary beings, yet the intrinsic principles of the " possible " include the composition be- tween matter as potential and form. This bespeaks a pronounced limitation because the possibles are " indifferent " to the being which they actually have. Therefore the question of cause immediately enters. For Father O'Brien, the fourth way immediately offers aspects of limitation, because the more and the less good, noble and true all'indicate that these perfections are presently found in varying degrees, and therefore more or less limited. Finally, the fifth way, in the order of finality, also manifests</page><page sequence="14">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God ioi aspects of limitation, since beings lacking in knowledge cannot ex- plain precisely the direction that is involved in the finality that they manifest. Obviously, a causal investigation is thereby demanded. The process of the five ways shows their suitability to the meta- physical task. This is evident since the process of each of them to their proper conclusion is the resolution of an aspect of limitation, according to its metaphysical signification, into its ultimate causal explanation. This is a realization of the Thomistic principle that from every effect the existence of its proper cause can be demonstrated. In the five ways this means efficient causality, since the existence of actual effects demands an efficient cause, because the effects corre- spond proportionately to their causes. Father O'Brien maintains that itis clearly evident that the five ways resolve effects into their corresponding causes. In the first way, since " to be moved is to be reduced from potency to act and to move is to reduce something from potency to act : hence, the effi- cient cause of movement, the mover, must be a being in act. " 17 Thus, a cause is given according to the form of the effect. More, however, is needed. The cause of the form-as-such of the effect must be reached, that is, the cause "secundum esse", of the effect. In the first way this is from movement beyond moved movers to a mover moved by none. The form of the effect as such is transcended in assigning a cause in which the same formality is not found, to which the causing of the form as such is proper. In the second way "to be an efficient cause is to exercise effi- cient causality, on the production of an effect since an order of causes is found, and the efficiency cannot be exercised by a cause upon itself, the subordinated cause is at once an effect, and demands a cause superior in efficacy. " 18 Here also the process continues from subordinated, caused causes to a first cause beyond all median causes, uncaused as a cause. In the process of the third way the possible and the necessary are examined. " Of their nature existent things, which are generated and corrupt, are possibles. They thus demand a cause superior in being, a necessary. " 19 Again the metaphysical process continues from the possible to a necessary which has no cause of its necessity in being, but is the cause of all other beings. 17 O'Brien, op. cit., p. 231. 18 Ibid., p. 231. 19 Ibid., p. 231.</page><page sequence="15">I02 DONALD R. KEHEW Concerning the grades that are found in things, of which the fourth way investigates, we see that " such grades in the perfections indicated show that the perfections are limited, and the cause de- manded must be superior with regard to such perfection, 'a maxi- mum'."20 From this we are able to move from graduated perfections, limited perfections, to a maximum, the unlimited cause of these per- fections in all others. Finally, in the fifth way, where the finality of the operation of being is brought into focus, we see that " finalized operation as an effect demands a proportionate cause, the ordered demands an orderer, an intelligent agent giving the teleological determination to nature and operation. " 21 The final step in this process is to move from things which are determined and directed, in operating for an end, to an intelligent governor. Through this line of reasoning, Father O'Brien maintains that the process of each of the ways, developed along the resolutory lines of propter causality, is appropriate to the scientific character of metaphysics, and conducive to the successful conclusion of its quest to know its proper subject, as to its " propter quid, " in terms of perfect scientific knowledge. Finally, the terminations of the five ways exhibit a relevance and a suitability to the attainment of the objective of metaphysics in its order of discovery. Father O'Brien maintains that the ways proceed from five formally distinct aspects of reality and reach conclusions, as the result of the process of resolution along the lines of proper causality, which are formally distinct, one from the other. The five conclusions open the way to the discovery of the " propter quid, " the first cause of all being, subsistent " esse. " These conclusions necessitate further investigation in terms of the proper formality of this science, " habens esse. " Such an inquiry, embracing two general steps, leads to the unique, subsistent " esse, " which as such is the cause of all being. According to Father O'Brien, the first step in his inquiry is an examination of the conclusions of the five ways in the light of the proper subject of the science, resulting in the realization that each cause is a being without limitation, subsistent " esse. " The second step is the further conclusion that subsistent " esse " is necessarily unique. 20 Ibid., p. 231. 21 Ibid., p. 231.</page><page sequence="16">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 103 Since we have now exposed, in very general lines, the function that Father O'Brien assigns to the five ways, we will now examine and evaluate this Thomistic approach to the existence of God that receives such high praise from Father O'Brien. Employed within the context of metaphysics' order of discovery, in its investigation of its proper subject, the " quinqué viae " in their starting point, in their processes, and in their conclusions are eminently relevant. Through them a subsisting being is discovered. 22 For Father O'Brien, the five ways retain all their value as meta- physical demonstrations of the existence of the First Cause. The con- clusions are formally distinct, but through them the way is opened to the discovery of the unique First Cause of all being. Criticism and Evaluation of This Thomistc Approach In the clear and methodic presentation of Father O'Brien's position there is much to be gained in philosophical research and progress. Although we find wide areas of agreement in his penetrating study, there are other theses of the author to which we cannot subscribe. We agree with his definition of metaphysics as " the science of being-qua-being and of those things which either as properties or as causes pertain 'per se' to the consideration of being, " since all conceptions that make God the subject of metaphysics are to be rejected. We see as more consistent with the authentic position of Saint Thomas himself Father O'Brien's rejection of the opinion of the Gilsonian School which makes God the proper object of Metaphysics. In raising our thoughts to the consideration of Him Who is, Chris- tianity revealed to Metaphysics the true nature of its proper object. When with Aristotle a Christian defines Metaphysics as the science of being as being, we may rest assured that he understands it always as the science of Being as Being... that is to say, God. 23 Father O'Brien is more consistent here with the order of meta- physics' discovery of the truth as the science of being as being, 28 Ibid., p. 239. 28 Gilson, E. The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy (JNew York, 1940), p. 00.</page><page sequence="17">I04 DONALD R. KEHEW with the consideration of God coming only as the final chapter of that study, as the cause of that subject. Metaphysics is the human science which considers being in common as its proper subject, which consequently attains God solely and exclusively as principle of this subject. In considering the order to be followed in approaching the ques- tion of Goďs existence, we subscribe to Father O'Brien's position of rejecting the order of the Summa Theologiae as unsuitable for the metaphysical task. Many Thomistic authors, considering the question along the same lines as Father O'Brien, have emphasized the need of situating the third article of the second question of the first part of the Summa Theologiae in the context in which is was written. Canon Van Steen- berghen has continually stressed this need. I have always tried to understand them (the quinqué viae) as an historian of philosophy should try to understand an author of the 13th century : he should try to grasp what this author has wished to say and, for that, he should take account of the whole of his doctrine and its his- torical context. 24 Continuing in the line of reasoning as an historian of philosophy, the same author has clearly applied this to the five ways. When we isolate the text of the Five Ways from its immediate context, we are guilty of unjustifiably mutilating the thought of St. Thomas. We do something wrong when we present as his last word on the subject a summary and incomplete exposé of his ideas on the proofs for God's existence. 25 This emphasis is also reflected in the wisdom of Victor White's remarks at the beginning of his paper " Prelude to the Five Ways. " He writes : It has become extraordinarily difficult to read the text of St. Thom- as Aquinas as he wrote it, or as it would have been read by his con- temporaries... Those sections of the text which have a particular interest and importance of their own may all too easily be read torn out of their context in the closely-knit unity which is the Summa Theologiae, and disregard for what precedes or follows them in the original text can too 24 Van Steenberghen, F.

Hidden God (Louvain, 1966), pp. 159-160.</page><page sequence="18">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 105 easily distort their meaning and purport. There is also the risk that we seek in the Summa for contributions to controversies which are not yet arisen when it was written ; or answers to questions which the original text had already excluded... Our reading of the Quinqué Viae - the so-called "Five Ways'' of proving the existence of God - in the Summa (I, ii, 3) is perhaps rather especially liable to be blurred in these ways. 26 This context, as Father O'Brien clearly states, is a theological setting - question two is properly a theological question concerning theology's proper subject, God. Most Thomistic authors concur on this point. Edward Siliem is but one clear example. For Saint Thomas the question of establishing the existence of God is a part of the vaster question about the essence of God, and it is plan- ned to be treated not for its own sake, but for the sake of showing what the divine essence is... St. Thomas is clearly not planning his Summa Theologiae in the way that a philosopher now-a-days needs to plan his natural theology... St. Thomas is concerned with God as He has revealed Himself to us, with what God has told us about Himself, or in technical terms, with the divine essejice itself, and not simply with God as the cause of created things... In other words, the question of the existence of God, and equally that of how God does not exist (which is necessary to show how different God is from all created things) is regarded by him, not as a separate question to be treated on its own philosophically, as though it had nothing to do with the revelation of God, before treating the divine essence, but as involved in the theological study of God's essence. 27 Victor White sums up this aspect of the historical and doctrinal context of Question two with the statement The Summa Theologiae is not, as it is sometimes supposed, a " pot- pourri " of theology and philosophy ; it is wholly a Summa of Theology concerned with the Sacra Doctrina, the Holy Teaching of salvation given by God's revelation. But because it is that, it can use philosophical argument for its own end - which is " hominis salus " - the health or salvation of man. 28 We therefore align ourselves with Father O'Brien and the many other Thomistic philosophers in rejecting the order of Question Two of Part One for the metaphysical task. We concur with this author in criticizing M. Gilson and his followers in claiming the right to ex- 26 White, V. God the Unknown (London, 1956), p. 35. 27 Siliem, op. cit., pp. 43-44. 28 White, op. cit., p. 44.</page><page sequence="19">I06 DONALD R. KEHEW pound the philosophical thought of the Angelic Doctor along the lines of its original development. Gilson is at pains explicitly to pre- sent the order of the Summa as Saint Thomas' philosophical doctrine on the existence of God. We, in union with Father O'Brien and a host of other Thomists, vigorously oppose such an opinion. This we do because M. Gilson has advanced, as the philosophy of St. Thom- as in regard to God's existence, a treatment and an order which is theological. To neither sacred theology nor to metaphysics is such a treatment and an order a service. We also subscribe to Father O'Brien's thesis that the discovery of Infinite Being in metaphysics is not made by starting from a nom- inal definition of God. We agree that the usage of a nominal defi- nition of God is inappropriate to metaphysics. The inclusion of Canon Van Steenberghen in the list of that group of philosophers who hold that a nominal definition of God is necessary has been shown to be due to a misunderstanding by Father O'Brien of Canon Van Steen- berghen's treatment of metaphysics. In a review of Father O'Brien's book for the 1963 issue of " Philosophical Studies " (vol. XII), the Canon has emphasized that ...there is never a question of a " nominal definition " of God in the pages of my " Ontology " where the existence of Infinite Being, unique cause of the order of finite being, is demonstrated... Only once in my " Ontology " is mention made of the nominal definition of God, where I show that the metaphysical proof of the existence of an Infinite Being is also the sole rigorous proof of the existence of God. Thus I in- dicate the connection between the Metaphysical theme of the infinite Being and the religious problem of the existence of God. It is apropos of this religious problem only that a nominal definition of God is required. 29 In evaluating the presentation of Father O'Brien, it can be seen that we are in accord with a large part of his presentation, beginning with his definition of metaphysics, continuing through the order to be followed in this study and, finally, with his rejection of the usage of a nominal definition of God in metaphysics. Yet, the next step, the function of the " quinqué viae " in the science of metaphysics, is the area of our genuine disagreement with the author. In the light of the vast amount of philosophical writing that has been devoted to a critical study of the five ways, we feel justified in opposing the thesis of Father O'Brien in three large areas of his presentation. 29 Van Steenberghen, Philosophical Studies , pp. 144-145.</page><page sequence="20">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 107 1) The first point of disagreement concerns Father O'Brien's approach to a knowledge of being as limit. He confirms that the metaphysician, after having established the fact that limited being exists, is justified in posing the question " propter quid, " whose response will be the affirmation of the First Cause of finite beings. Yet, Father O'Brien claims that the " knowledge of beings as limited... is derived from the realization of the real composition of essence and existence, as well as of more evident aspects of an act-potency composition in the beings of experience. " 30 This appears to be a direct reversal of the process of knowledge - the knowledge of beings as finite precedes the knowledge of the real composition of essence and existence of those beings. 2) The second area of disagreement is in line with a large number of authors who find the reasoning of the five ways unsatisfactory and completely lacking in suitability for the metaphysical task. Father O'Brien has claimed that the five ways are " eminently relevant " 31 to the metaphysical task. It seems that he fails to perceive the many pertinent difficulties attributed to the five ways. Some difficulties of each way follow. Concerning the first way : A capital difficulty in this argument is that metaphysical examination of change establishes the fact of at least one unmoved mover, but it does not demonstrate the existence of only one unmoved mover. Canon Van Steenberghen has clearly highlighted this difficulty. The reasoning as such is well defined and accurate, but it does not permit us to conclude immediately to the unicity of the First Principle... Aristotle proved the unicity of the First Mover on astronomical grounds derived from the unity of the cosmos and the unicity of the first change- able or the first heaven... In the Summa Theologiae the points derived from the Aristotelian astronomy have happily been left aside, but the proof of the unicity of the First Mover is also lost with them. 32 Walter Kaufmann of the Philosophy faculty of Princeton Uni- versity has also emphasized this difficulty. He says We become involved in Thomas' metaphysics, in his adaptation of Aristotle... Aquinas' God, like Aristotle's first mover, is unmoved, but Aristotle used this argument in his Metaphysics, from which Thomas 80 O'Brien, op. cit., p. 211. 31 Ibid., p. 239. 32 Van Steenberghen, F. Ontology (New York, 1952), pp. 148-149.</page><page sequence="21">I08 DONALD R. KEHEW has derived it, to infer the existence of over forty unmoved movers. Is not Thomas arbitrary in supposing that there is but one ? Later in the Summa, he tries to show why there can be only one God. But why call this one god, " God ?" 33 It therefore seems that the conclusion of the first way which states that " it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other ; and this everyone understands to be God " to be beyond that which has been proved in this first argument. Concerning the second way : The second way, because it closely parallels the first, centering in the concept of cause rather than mo- tion is therefore subject to the same weakness of a premature con- clusion. Canon Van Steenberghen forcefully indicates this in " Hidden God" under the chapter entitled " Incomplete Solutions." It proves that you must seek the absolute beyond dependent or caused causes and that there exists therefore at least one first cause. But is this first cause one or many ? Is it finite or infinite ? Creative or merely transforming ? Corporeal or incorporeal ? Personal or imper- sonal ? The text of the " secunda via " provides no answers to these questions, though they are very important to the theistic theory. Here, too, we find ourselves in the presence of a demonstration that is incomplete and that calls for indispensable development. 34 Professor Kaufmann remarks in a similar vein concerning this point. Whether taken by itself or in conjunction with the first proof, the second way no less than the first says in essence that the universe cannot be understood without postulating at least one occult entity. 36 Like the first way, the conclusion of the second way goes beyond that which has been proved by the argumentation. Concerning the third way : This way, as listed in the Summa , is presented in a complicated and confusing form which is better cor- rected by the argumentation found in the Summa contra Gentiles (i ,15). By the use of this clearer, parallel text, we are able to for- mulate the reasoning of Saint Thomas into a simpler form, beginning with the observation that contingent beings exist. However, we 88 Kaufmann, W. Critique of Religion and Philosophy (New York, 1961), pp. 151-152. 84 Van Steenberghen, Hidden God, p. 124. 85 Kaufmann, op. cit., p. 154.</page><page sequence="22">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 109 know that every contingent being is caused and consequently can be explained only by the necessary. Yet a distinction is needed in the category of the necessary, since the necessary can be either necessary of itself or it can draw its necessity from a cause. In this latter case, one must rise to a being which is necessary of itself, that is, an absolute being. Once again in this line of logical progression, as in the first two ways, we find the premature assumption of one, sole " per se ' first principle. The argument does lead logically to at least one " per se " necessary being but it does not establish that there is only one such necessary being. We therefore see that the criticism of the first three ways is similar, they all contain a premature conclusion based upon the lack of establishing a unique first principle. Concerning the fourth way : The criticism of this proof is usually directed to two principles used here by Saint Thomas as universally true, yet in reality these two principles are found not to be true in all cases. The criticism of the first of these principles is well formu- lated by Canon Van Steenberghen. The principle that " the more and less are so called with respect to a maximum " is certainly not true in all cases, for " the more and less " are often so designated with respect to a unit of measure. Thus a person is more or less rich according as he possesses a more or less impressive number of " francs " or " dollars. " 36 In replying to this frequently stated criticism, Father O'Brien maintains that this principle should be understood only of tran- scendental perfections. Canon Van Steenberghen answers I reply : 1) it is a pity St. Thomas did not actually say it ; it would have sufficed to add two words : " magis et minus in transcendentalibus dicuntur... " ; 2) even in this new form the truth of the principle ap- pears only to him who already knows that the " Maxime ens " exists : before that, one does not know if the perfection of being can exist in a pure state ; one establishes the fact that finite beings share the perfection of being but one does not know yet if they participate in a perfection fully preexisting ; hence the principle cannot serve to prove the exis- tence of the " Maxime ens. " 37 A Second principle in this argument, here criticized by Pro- fessor Kaufmann, is equally invalid 86 Van Steenberghen, Ontology, pp. 150-151. 37 Van Steenberghen, Philosophical Studies, pp. 148-149.</page><page sequence="23">IIO DONALD R. KEHEW The second principle will recommend itself to few readers ideed. In spite of its noble ancestry, we should not admit that " the maximum in any genus is the cause of all in that genus/' as if there must be some- thing hottest that is the cause of all heat and something most purple that is the cause of purple in all purple things. 38 Because of these two invalid principles, upon which Saint Thom- as has essentially based his process of argumentation, this fourth way must be regarded as an unsatisfactory proof. Concerning the fifth way : The fifth way involves a double diffi- culty in its reasoning. Again, the conclusion goes beyond that which has been proved, which is the most serious difficulty in this argu- ment. The second area of misunderstanding is the example of the flying arrow that Saint Thomas uses to illustrate his argument. In this fifth way he is reasoning concerning beings which have a spe- cific nature, that is, a principle of a determined activity, yet the example of the arrow does not illustrate this, since the arrow is an inert body deprived of all natural movement. Therefore, the arrow example should be discarded, since it fails to serve the purpose of an example, which is to make intelligible a doctrine or a principle. The first difficulty, concerning the premature conclusion is high- lighted by Canon Van Steenberghen. ...it is the existence of finalized natures which requires an intelli- gence. I am quite disposed to accept this idea, which I believe pertinent and fertile. But it must be admitted that numerous precisions have to be added before concluding to the existence of God. Is there one sole intelligence at the origin of all natures? Is it immanent in the world or transcendent ? Is it a Demiurge who organizes the primitive chaos a Creator ? It would be ridiculous to claim that all these problems, still debated lively today, are resolved at the end of the quinta via. 39. Professor Kaufmann has interpreted this argumentation as an analogy between the universe and a human artifact. It appears that the example of the arrow has misled him. He speaks of an inert human artifact rather than a " natural " being, that is, a being having need of being directed by an intelligence. Kaufmann's con- sequent rejection of the argument is, therefore, really a rejection of the reasoning that the world is made even as things are made by human beings. Obviously, this is unacceptable. 88 Kaufmann, op. cit., p. 157. 89 Van Steenberghen, op. cit., p. 149.</page><page sequence="24">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God in The main reason for our rejection of this fifth way as a rigorous proof of the existence of God is that the extension of the conclusion is too vast. This invalidating defect, added to the confusion of a poorly chosen example, makes the process of the argumentation unacceptable. Conclusion of the Five Ways : It is in the light of all of, these critical evaluations that the use Father O'Brien makes of the five ways must be rejected. The very serious objections raised against them contradict Father O'Brien's high praise of the five ways as being " admirably appropriate to metaphysics as a process of dis- covery. " 40 Rather, it has been shown that there is a basic sufficiency in the five ways ; the first two ways must be completed, the third and fifth ways have to be corrected and then completed, and the fourth way is unsatisfactory. The statement of Canon Van Steenberghen concerning the five ways as a line of argumentation for the existence of God is a good conclusion to this area of our study. The conclusion of all this is obvious : it is time for contemporary Thomists to abandon the " fetishism " of the quinqué viae... I am con- vinced that if St. Thomas returned among us, he would be the first to disavow the text of the quinqué viae and to request his disciples to use it with more discernment than they have too often shown. 41 3) Our third area of disagreement with Father O'Brien is in his use of these quinqué viae in the metaphysical task. We agree with him that the conclusions of these arguments do not give us " Ipsum esse subsistens " as he strongly emphasizes in expounding the double process necessary to pass from the conclusions to the existence of the unique Subsistent Being. Our area of disagreement is in using the five ways for the metaphysical critique of limited being which should lead to the discovery of unlimited and unique Being. This critique must be a critique of limited being, as limited or finite. The use of the five ways reveals characteristics that are dis- covered in corporeal beings (they change, they depend on causes, they begin and they cease to exist, they tend toward a determined end) but are not necessarily characteristics which belong to finite beings as such (" characteristics which manifest its radical relativity or dependence : I think that these characteristics are the ontological 40 O'Brien, op. cit., p. 218. 41 Van Steenberghen, op. cit., p. 151.</page><page sequence="25">112 DONALD R. KEHEW likeness of finite beings among themselves and their essentially active tendency. ") 42 The first three ways and the fifth way can conclude immediately only to a transcending of the corporeal world and a further reflec- tion is indispensable in order to transcend the created order entirely. It therefore seems that the use of these cosmological arguments is an unnecessary deviation that prolongs and complicates the ex- position. Because of these three areas of basic, fundamental difference with the author, it would seem to be impossible to subscribe to the thesis of Father O'Brien that the clearest and the most fundamental argumentation for arriving at the existence of God is the meta- physical approach using the five ways of Saint Thomas. A Proposed Approach to This Problem To proceed to the affirmation of the existence of God only two requirements are necessary, the witness of experience and the use of reason. The requirement of the witness of experience fulfills the need of an " a posteriori " proof, since such a proof proceeds from the plane of real, existing effects to the plane of the cause of that reality. The second requirement, that of the use of reason, retains the proof on the necessary metaphysical level, which involves a demonstration based upon a reflection on the nature of reality as such and on the condition of real existence. The first step of the proof is to examine the implications of that which experience reveals to us - the existence of sensible things, whether animate or inanimate. The tangible empirical data of our experience is a world of things and persons. The examination of this data reveals that we exist and the world exists but this existence and life are a perpetual wonder to us, a mystery, a cause of endless amazement. A large part of this wonderment concerns the fact that this existence is present to us as something imposed, something given, something that does not explain itself, something that we ourselves did not cause. The fact that our experience reveals a non self-explanatory existence impels us to seek an explanation, to seek the fundamental source and origin of this " given " existence. 42 Ibid., pp. 150-151.</page><page sequence="26">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 113 That which is not self-existent, which cannot provide within itself an explanation of its own existence is obviously contingent, dependent and relative. This appears to be the condition of not only human existence but also of the existence of the other things in the universe and the universe itself, since nothing in the experienced universe provides the explanation of its own existence. Neither man, nor the things of the world, nor the universe itself appear as self- explanatory, self-sufficient, absolute. The crucial question of the first step of the proof is to determine if man's knowledge is able to proceed beyond this condition of relative reality to that of an abso- lute, an unconditioned reality sufficient to account for its own exis- tence. It is obvious that only one of two responses is possible to this question. These two responses are : a) no known Absolute exists, or b) an Absolute must and does exist. These are the only two possi- bilities, there is no middle gound. We shall now examine each of these possibilities. (a) No known Absolute exists The first possible response is one that has great popular appeal today. According to some philosophers today, especially some of the contemporary 41 existentialists " of whom we spoke in the intro- duction of this chapter, beings simply exist as a matter of fact. They claim that no metaphysical justification for these is pos- sible. The empirical fact of existence is a fact without explanation - it is simply given. Objective reality has no sufficient explana- tion - it is simply there. As such it is meaningless and thus irra- tional. In this light, existence is considered to be absurd (in the sense of meaningless) and no metaphysical explanation of it is pos- sible. Because of this inability of explanation, these philosophers maintain that no judgment is possible concerning the question of an absolute basis for existence. Such a position is itself a metaphysical thesis, since this proposal, which affirms the absurdity of existence, refuses to attempt any metaphysical inquiry which aims at explaining existence. A method- ical doubt, which involves a provisional suspension of the meta- physical inquiry, is here dogmatized into a definite and final meta- physical position, a position which refuses any ontological judgment. It is without doubt that absurdity certainly exists, but it does not exist in being. Rather, it exists as a mental attitude toward being. 8 - Franciscan Studies 1972</page><page sequence="27">114 DONALD R. KEHEW The idea of the absurdity of being and existence, like the idea of nothingness which was so competently analyzed by Bergson, is one of those negative ideas which are actually nothing more than pseudo- concepts, implying contradiction, because they merely express a mental annulment of what has just been stated. 43 This position, that objective empirical reality rests upon no Absolute whatsoever, is a radical hypothesis which itself requires a rational support and basis which is not offered by those who present it. The affirmation that objective reality is irrational and meaningless is not sufficient from the philosophical point of view. Reasons for such an hypothesis are required since this hypothesis represses a natural and spontaneous tendency of the human person who does not find satisfaction in the simple ascertainment of the fact of existence. Rather man, as a questioning animal, inevitably seeks the basis, the source, the cause of such existence. Hence, this thesis, and any such thesis which denies the absolute, is an important thesis which re- quires proofs. Those who maintain this position, however, offer no such justification. It thereby seems to be a position contrary to the very nature of man to accept such an hypothesis as that of " absurd existence " as an understanding of the human condition. (b) An Absolute must and does exist This only other alternative is to affirm that non self-sufficient existence implies the existence of an absolute, that the relative nec- essarily leads to the absolute. Since relative means dependent, conditioned and non self-sufficient, the absolute reality by defini- tion would be independent, unconditioned and self-sufficient. Since relative reality exists, an absolute reality must exist to account for it. Everything cannot be relative. There must be at least one being who is self-existent, who has existence without having received it from a cause. The impossibility of its contradictory makes this evi- dent. To state that everything which exists, exists in virtue of something else is clearly contradictory, since both logically and con- ceptually it is impossible and thereby destroys itself. There must be an absolute to account for the relative, which absolute is self- existent. In short, since something exists, something is self-existent. The history of philosophy has shown that the existence of an 48 Tresmontant, C. Toward the Knowledge of God (Baltimore, 1961), p. 26.</page><page sequence="28">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 115 absolute has been acknowledged by most great thinkers. It is the understanding of the nature of this absolute that has differed greatly in this history of philosophy. Two general groupings, how- ever, are able to be distinguished concerning the understanding of an absolute. The first group, those who acknowledge a necessary, uncondi- tioned existence, an absolute as the foundation of reality, had con- ceived the absolute in various, yet similar ways. In these theories, empirical reality is based upon, or established within, this absolute in such a way that empirical reality, the world itself, is the absolute or a modality or aspect of the absolute substance. The human con- scious subject, and indeed the world with its totality of empirical reality, is totally immersed in the absolute and thereby is part of the absolute. Often this participation in the absolute is seen as a condition of alienation, exile or a similar mode of relationship toward the absolute. Such a metaphysical hypothesis, in varying interpretations, has a long tradition extending from the Upanishads to Plotinus, Spinoza, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. Even materialism (as proposed, for example, by Marx and Engels), while refusing to accept the universe as a modality of a reality in alienation from the absolute, can be classified in this category since these proponents strongly maintain that matter itself is the absolute. Attempts to show the insufficiency, and thus the unacceptability, of such hypotheses have often been on the elementary, empirical level where the first fact which is acknowledged is that man is not self-sufficient. The realization that existence is as something given, something which neither created itself nor is able to account for its own existence, extends from man to the universe as a whole and to all the elements of the universe. Neither the universe nor any of the beings which exist within the universe, are self-sufficient. Everything in the universe appeared at a particular moment in time and science affirms that everything is likewise perishable. Such refutations as these do not seem to be an adequate answer to those who maintain that matter itself is the absolute. Although materialism leaves unanswered many important questions (e.g. How does matter explain the obvious finality apparent in nature, espe- cially living organism ? ; How is the evident evolution in the world from the imperfect to the perfect explained ? ; etc.), a refutation of it on this empirical level is not enough. We maintain that the only</page><page sequence="29">Il6 DONALD R. KEHEW adequate refutation of this problem is the one that we shall offer in the second step of our proof. The other grouping of thinkers, who acknowledge the existence of an absolute, has been those who maintain that the absolute must be wholly other than the material, the empirically objectivized. The absolute must be ontologically distinct from the universe and every part thereof, yet be the cause and reason for its existence. The con- cept of causality is, they maintain, a valid vehicle with which to arrive at the knowledge of the absolute beyond the material universe. The principle of sufficient reason allows one to see, in the analysis of the continually evolving system of the universe, that in the passage of time something " more " is continually being manifested, which the former (and lesser) is unable to adequately explain. Matter can- not, in itself, account for life, just as life cannot adequately explain the thinking and personal monads that are the human beings. At the very beginning of such a process of evolution, nothingness cannot possibly account for the emergence of material reality. It is obvious that only being can account for being and the principle of sufficient reason indicates the inability of trying to explain being in terms of non-being, the greater in terms of the lesser and the new in terms of the old. If the search for the absolute stops at this point, then all the objections and criticisms which we have made concerning the cos- mological arguments of Saint Thomas could aptly apply here also. All that has been proved, at this point, is that an absolute or some absolutes must exist, and that this absolute must be sought beyond the world of material beings. There is nothing at this point in this argumentation to prevent the absolute or absolutes from being found within the realm of non-material finite being. The relativity of ma- terial beings does not in itself show the relativity of other finite beings which may exist beyond this category. It will be recalled that this was one of our objections to Father O'Brien's use of the five ways of Saint Thomas. We maintain that to rigorously attain the true absolute it must be demonstrated that this absolute is beyond the total order of all finite beings. This is the task of the second step of our proof - to demonstrate that the finite order, as such, is relative, dependent and contingent and by so doing, proving the existence of an infinite being as the Absolute, the cause of that finite order. This second step in the proof of the existence of God is without</page><page sequence="30">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 117 doubt more difficult than the first, since this step concerns the area beyond that of immediate perception, that is, beyond the empirical order of human experience. It is strictly a metaphysical process, a reflection bearing upon being as such and upon the conditions of the real as such. This is the only way to go beyond the order of expe- rience itself and make affirmations concerning every finite being, even those outside the world of human experience. The whole force of the arguments rests upon the demonstration that the finite order (the totality of all finite beings) is relative. The whole finite order, synthesized by the mind, never departs from the real plane, the plane of existence. The long history of philosophical inquiry shows the various at- tempts to prove the relativity or dependence of the total order of finite being. Many of them are obviously defective since they fail to rigorously establish that which they seek to prove. Some claim that this relative characteristic of finite being is proved by its real composition, that is, the synthesis of two correl- ative elements - essence and existence. This is Father O'Brien's contention in which he states that " knowledge of being as limited is derived from the realization of the real composition of essence and existence. " 44 It was exactly this point which was the first area of disagreement that we made in our criticism and evaluation of Father O'Brien's presentation. Others have maintained that the fact that existence does not enter into the definition of finite being indicates its relativity. Many of the qualified criticism leveled against the ontological (a priori) argument of Saint Anselm, concerning the inability of passing from the logical plane to the real plane, are able to be aplied to this at- tempt to show the non-absolute character of the finite order. Another approach has been a consideration of the range or hier- archy that the total order of finite beings manifest. This hierarchy implies or suggests an absolute maximum at its summit and rela- tivity or dependence for everything below this summit. Although an absolute does indeed seem to be implied in this hierarchy of finite beings, the existence of this absolute is not the conclusion of a strict process of reasoning and is thereby unacceptable. A more satisfactory approach to this question has been the strong insistence that 44 O'Brien, op. cit., p. 211.</page><page sequence="31">Il8 DONALD R. KEHEW ...knowledge of the relativity of the finite as such can be acquired only by the metaphysical critique of its being and of its activity , for these are the only two aspects of any finite being which are accessible to us. 45 This two-fold critique of finite being clearly presents the entire finite order as relative, dependent and non self-sufficient. Each of these two aspects serves as a sign of fundamental dependency. Concerning the being of the finite The being of the finite beings shows a relation of both opposition and of similarity to other finite beings. The opposition is seen by the fact that each finite being is one, distinct and individual, and by being so is thereby opposed to each other finite being. Each of these other finite beings is also, in its turn, one, distinct and individual and thus opposed to all others. The only being which would not be so opposed to each and every other would be the total cause of the other, since the total cause precontains the one caused, and is therefore obviously not opposed. It is evident, therefore, that one finite being cannot be the adequate cause of another, since if it were this creative cause it would precontain the other and so could not be in opposition to it. This relation of oppo- sition does not of itself imply real dependence between finite beings but rather isolation and separation, one from the other. It is the profound similarity (despite the diversity and opposi- tion) that reveals the fundamental relativity of all finite beings, since all finite beings are altogether alike as beings. The ontological sim- ilarity must remain unintelligible unless we go outside the finite order, because it can only be accounted for by their common depen- dence on one single cause transcending all finite beings. It is from this critique of the being of finite beings that we reach the realization that the absolute cannot be finite but rather, of ne- cessity, must be non-finite (which is infinite). Concerning the activity of the finite Finite beings possess the power of activity. This is readily seen in those finite beings of experience which visibly manifest change, transformation and growth. The science of metaphysics clearly in- 45 Van Steenberghen, Hidden God, p. 189.</page><page sequence="32">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 119 dicates that this is likewise true of all finite beings, since all finite beings possess existence and thereby possess the power to perfect that existence, yet each in a way or mode proper to its own type of finite existence. Indeed, Canon Van Steenberghen, in his textbook " Ontology " devotes five pages to the proof of this fact through a metaphysical analysis of the self. 46 This power of activity is the striving or acting of a being to seek new perfection, to extend itself by entering into relationship with surrounding beings. This property of activity plainly indicates cer- tain characteristics of finite beings, including both the dependency upon other beings to gain this perfection (because no being can give itself a perfection it does not already possess) and the power or desire of perfection which makes the particular finite being act. Both of these aspects of activity reveal the essential dependency of finite being. In the first case it is dependent because it tends positively toward other beings in order to perfect itself. The power of expansion directs finite being towards other finite beings in which it finds its complementary perfection. Without other finite beings, one finite being cannot conquer its isolation or realize itself fully. The activity that emanates from the very nature of the active, finite being (the power of expansion and perfection) is also an indi- cation of its essential dependence. This power of self-perfection shows that, in its very being, the finite being is under the influence of a cause which, in giving it being, gives it by that very same fact, this power to expand and to perfect itself. In this way it is obviously dependent upon that cause. Finally, it must be noted that because one finite being perfects itself by means of another or other finite beings it does not neces- sarily entail the lessening of the perfection of the other. Rather, an increase of perfection is added to the total order of finite beings. This obvious need of others in order to accomplish activity indicates, as we have just shown, the relativity of finite beings on the indi- vidual level. However, what is true of individual finite beings is like- wise true of the collection of these individuals which is the order of finite beings. In this way, the total order of finite beings is relative, since all change involves dependency and is thereby obviously not the absolute. Rather, the absolute must be outside the total order of the finite, it must be non-finite (which is infinite). 46 Van Steenberghen, Ontology, pp. 120-125.</page><page sequence="33">I20 DONALD R. KEHEW The fact that the absolute, the infinite is only one sole being is immediately perceived since unicity is a corollary of infinity. The exact meaning of ontological infinity is thus brought out : the infinite Being is that being who is opposed to nothing, who is lim- ited by no other. There is evidently only one such being for, if there were many infinite beings, they would be opposed to one another and con- sequently finite. The expression " many infinite beings " is a contradic- tion in terms. 47 Our metaphysical, rational proof has brought us to the existence of one infinite being, the cause of the totality of the finite order. That which is implied in the attribute of cause can lead us to the primary consideration in our proof of God, that of personality. We have seen that the ontological likeness between finite beings is based upon their common participation in the Infinite who is their total cause. The very nature of causality reveals that the cause, as cause, necessarily precontains its effect, as effect. By this is not meant that causality is some sort of a transfer of a perfection from the cause to its effect. Rather, the cause precontaining its effects means that in order to have the power or capacity to produce some effect, a cause itself must possess a degree of perfection at least equal to that of its effects. This principle, when applied to the infinite being, the cause of the totality of the finite order, can give us a glimpse of the nature of this infinite being by a careful study of the caused (or created) universe. Everything that is genuine perfection or real worth in creatures preexists in the creative cause, yet in an incomparably more intense way. This is true whether the perfections are mixed (that is, essentially finite and some even corporeal) or if they are unmixed (that is, in no way essentially bound up with the finite). Mixed perfections, revealed to us through our perceptive experience of the corporeal world, are essentially linked to finitude since to purge them of all reference to the finite is for them to lose their specific connotation. Therefore, these perfections cannot be predi- cated of the infinite in a formal way since this would imply attrib- uting finitude to the infinite, which is obviously contradictory. These perfections are able, however, to be predicated virtually of the infinite since he has the power to create these perfections. Our internal experience reveals to us perfections that are un- 47 Van Steenberghen, Hidden God, pp. 196-197.</page><page sequence="34">A Metaphysical Approach to the Existence of God 121 mixed, or simple. Our knowledge of ourselves puts us in presence with a reality which, although corporeal, is different from the rest of the corporeal world - the reality we call a person. One is aware of himself as person, as a " subject capable of thinking and willing , a center of knowledge and love . " 48 This personality is, to us, imperfect, finite, changing and dependent. However, the perfection of person- ality itself is not essentially bound up with finitude, since the notion of person is not destroyed if it is freed from the imperfections which finitude brings to it. This perfection of personality can be said to be precontained in its cause formally, that is, in its own form. In this way the infinite being must be a personal being, capable of thinking and willing, a center of knowledge and of love. We have here arrived at the affirmation of the existence of an infinite person who is the cause of all finite beings, the One who corresponds to what religion has traditionally designed as " God. " Some will certainly object that such an approach is a cold and artificial way to arrive at the existence of God, but this objection is not to say that it is out of place or wrong. Although the terms and statements used are simple and commonplace, it is only by reflection that their full implication can be appreciated. One of the mistakes of the modern nominalists is to treat necessary truths as platitudinous and, therefore, as uninformative ; they ignore one curious fact of human experience, a fact which cannot be denied, however difficult it may be to explain it. This fact is that many so- called obvious or trite statements take a long time to be appreciated or realized. I use the word " realize " because it brings to mind Newman's famous distinction between notional and real assent. Most of use are slow to realize what is familiar or to put together what is really con- nected because an effort of mind is required to effect the connection. 49 It is highly likely that most people come upon the awareness of God and accept His existence in ways which are far less formal and mediate than those which are expressed in the syllogistic premises of metaphysical reasoning. Nervertheless, whatever is the means that leads one to the knowledge of God's existence, it is justifiable to express the evidence and the certainty arising from it in metaphysical language and reasoning in the form of a strict logical demonstration. This natural mode of intellectual conviction is the explanation of 48 Ibid., p. 213. 49 D'Arcy, M. No Absent God (New York, 1962), p. 64.</page><page sequence="35">122 DONALD R. KEHEW the logical and real connections between the premises that one accepts and the conclusions that necessarily follow from them. To some this remains too simple a process, since to use the finite-with-finite relation as a model for the infinite-with-finite re- lationship is to abuse and stretch these ideas beyond their compass. Those who maintain this inability to reach the awareness of God through metaphysical reasoning do not seem to take into account our human awareness of dependence, of belonging and of kindred. This relationship could not be without there being one who is the cause of this dependency and belonging, without in any way having the dependent and imperfect status which is linked to our existence. Our awareness of this cause is, without doubt, almost wholly incom- petent to describe its true nature, but the fact that we are an effect of this cause does give us a glimpse, indistinct as it is, that can be used to enrich our understanding of both ourselves (as finite effects) and of God (as the infinite cause).
