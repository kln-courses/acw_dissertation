<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SOUNDINGS INTERVIEW THE COMPLEAT METAPHYSICIAN: A Conversation with Robert Cummings Neville Editor's Note: In the summer of 1 999 we persuaded Robert Cummings Neville, Professor of Philosophy, Religion, and Theology and Dean of the School of Theology at Boston University, to take some time from his busy and complicated schedule and talk with us about what the chattering classes like to call his "agenda. " The interview finally took place, mostly by e-mail, in November and December of this year. The notion of a single agenda is perhaps problematic in Neville's case not only because he is that rare Platonic bird, a philosopher-king (a philo- sophical theologian and a university Dean and "church bureaucrat9'), but also because he has built a much respected system of his own in what Julian Hartt in these pages a few years ago called the "no-man's land" of metaphysics (73.4 [Winter 1990]). Not only that, it is a system that has engaged without special irony, reserve, or prejudice the vast and busy enterprise, taking its initial cue from Alfred North Whitehead, that has come to be known as "process thought. " (The many dimensions of this enterprise are described elsewhere in this issue by George Allan, himself a highly respected "process thinker. ") Neville has respected the ambitions of process thought without suc- cumbing to what may be called a Whiteheadian scholasticism. A White- head scholastic is Alexandrian by temperament; the aim is to unpack the insights of the master for the benefit first of the theologians and then the rest of the literate but needy world. If the world does not appear to hunger and thirst after righteous prehensions, well, that precisely is the process agenda: that which ye ignorantly seek, such we declare unto you. For Neville, metaphysics is a set of hypotheses that we aim to test and set in order because they represent, ultimately, our protocol for negotiating a way through the world. In laying out what he takes this to involve, Neville is very much an heir to the author of Process and Reality. In religious terms, this is for him the way of Christian faith and witness. Neville's thought is laid out in more than fifteen books and in hun- dreds of essays and articles. His early God the Creator (1968) gave notice that the theologians and philosophers were going to have a fresh, Soundings 82.3-4 (Fall/Winter 1999).

Here was a theologian who would not be frightened off by the winds of doctrine that had dominated the 1960s and would preoccupy the 1970s. The bibliogra- phy is larded (and laced!) with titles like "Can God Create Men and Address Them Too?", "The Cumulative Effect of Behavior Control," "Pots and Black Kettles: A Philosopher's Perspective on Psychosurgery, " "Various Meanings of Privacy, " "The Scholar-Official as a Model for Ethics, " and "Body-Thinking in Chinese Philosophy. " Earlier this year a singular compliment was made to Neville's work in the publication by the State University of New York Press o/Interpreting Neville, edited byf. Harley Chapman and Nancy Frankenberry, contain- ing essays by fifteen distinguished scholars. And Abingdon Press pub- lished a collection of Neville's sermons, The God Who Beckons: Theology in the Form of Sermons. This pair of works, neither taking any specific notice of the other, provides only the most recent evidence that Neville's contribution to his several professions is well nigh unprecedented in American intellectual life. Our readers will note, however, a certain wry resistance to any such grand claims. In the first questions we try to tease out of him a specula- tion as to how his career may have been influenced by his having grown up in the city where the St. Louis Hegelians held forth, and where later T.S. Eliot took his first steps. Neville's answer is that he was more taken with Stan Musial and that he was lucky enough to see the legendary Satchel Paige pitch a game or two. What is a reviewer to do? ***** Soundings: Let's begin with some questions about the interests that led you into Philosophy. Already in your freshman year at Yale weren't you serving as assistant to John E. Smith, who would later be chair of Philosophy and, somewhat later, President of the APA? Was this assignment a lucky happenstance, or was there something already in your preparation for college that led to your being matched up with the philosopher who was to have such an influence upon you? Neville: Actually, Freshman year I served scrambled eggs in the dining hall breakfast line, genuinely useful work. Toward the end of that year we received our work-study assignments for the fol- lowing years, and I had requested to work for a philosopher. John Smith was randomly stuck with me. When I went to inter-</page><page sequence="3">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 341 view for the job, he was overwhelmingly dignified and energetic, with steel-gray hair, full professorial rank (I had met only assis- tant professors in philosophy up to that point) , and of extreme age. In fact, he was exactly twice my age. I was eighteen. Five days a week for the next three years I went to his office for two hours. We talked philosophy for an hour and three quarters, and then I did his typing. At first I was slow, but by senior year I took his dictation directly onto a little Smith-Corona portable typewriter and could go about 130 words a minute. That ac- counts for my relatively high rate of productivity as a scholar. Some of my philosophical competitors accuse me of publishing every idea IVe ever thought. That's false. I've published much more than that. It's in the fingers. The ideas that I have thought through, however, are nearly all derived from John and those conversations. Nowadays he seems hardly older than I am at all. In fact, though his hair has turned white, he still has it whereas my haircut has been involuntarily changed. Soundings: You came to Yale out of St. Louis. That's where T.S. Eliot came from to go into Philosophy at Harvard, over half a century earlier. That's where the St. Louis Hegelians did their work a half century before that. There's a statue of Schiller down near the old Railroad Station in St. Louis. Is there something in the air in St. Louis that nurtures the metaphysical bent, or itch, or awe? Or was Philosophy something that hit you by surprise right off the bat at Yale? Did you ever consider any other profession? Neville: St. Louis did and does have a worthy philosophic tradi- tion, but I didn't come from the social class that knew anything about that. My father did take me to the symphony and once to an opera, but mainly to the zoo and the ball game. Though I was too young to remember, I witnessed the 1944 World Series be- tween the Cardinals and the Browns; I do remember seeing Satchel Paige pitch. My first rite of serious worship was riding figure eights on my bike in front of the house I thought Stan Musial lived in. The most charismatic early influence, however, was the shortstop Marty Marion, whose number, 4, has influ- enced the structure of my philosophy ever since. (I allow people to believe the structure comes from Plato's divided line because that sounds so much more respectable.)</page><page sequence="4">342 SOUNDINGS The philosophic crisis of my young life occurred when I weis 14, walking down the hall of my high school talking to my En- glish teacher, Roy С Dripps. He said, "Well, Bob, you know that God is not in time." The strange thing is that I did know what that meant and that it is true. My book, Eternity and Time's Flow, explained it at length, with pictures too, forty years later. But in St. Louis I didn't know what kind of thing that strange knowl- edge was. I knew it had to do with religion, so I intensified my Christian life, becoming a local preacher in the Methodist Church at 15. 1 read books by Neis Ferré and Bernard Ramm, but decided they didn't get it. In college I heard of philosophy; I read Kierkegaard and Til- lich, and knew that they did get it. It was in the Wesley Founda- tion at Yale that I put together my Christian faith and philosophy, becoming a philosophical theologian. And it was there that I met Divinity School interns like Ralph Norman and Jeff Hopper, who advised me to talk with Hopper's father about a career. Stanley Romaine Hopper was Dean at Drew then, and he advised me that if I wanted to be a theologian I should study philosophy and avoid seminary, on the grounds that seminaries soften the mind. I did that and for my pains now have a job preventing at least one seminary from being a mind-softener. Soundings: Many refer to the years when you were doing under- graduate and graduate work at Yale as a kind of Golden Age for Philosophy there - Brumbaugh, Smith, Blanshard, Wells, Hendel, Weiss, Sellars, et al. And up on Prospect Street, at the Divinity School, there were Calhoun, Niebuhr, Lindbeck, Frei, Hartt, Christian. What were the major influences upon your de- veloping work there? Neville: Yes, it surely was a Golden Age. But it was coming to an end even then. I was in the last classes taught by Brand Blan- shard, Filmer Northop, and Charles Hendel (who had been the architect - should I say alchemist? - of that Golden Age). Dick Bernstein, Dick Rorty, and Don Sherburne were graduate stu- dents or instructors then, but they became famous elsewhere. I only had two religion classes as an undergraduate, both with Hans Frei. The first was called "The Christian Worldview," and Hans became ill partway through, to be replaced by Paul Holmer. The second, a directed study, was called "The Christian</page><page sequence="5">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 343 Weltanschauung," and it consisted of reading Barth and Tillich. What a learning experience, including the point that theology sounds truer in German! In graduate school, George Lindbeck was an assistant professor of medieval philosophy, prior to the Second Vatican Council from which he emerged as The Lindbeck of the Yale School. From both Hans and George I learned that inquiry into the truth of theological ideas is the most compelling contemporary philosophical task, quite the op- posite of what you might expect from people who became fa- mous for saying that theology is like cultural-anthropological descriptions of what some Christian communities believe in their deep structures. Needless to say, I don't read the Yale School the way it usually is read. Paul Weiss is just as unlikely to have spurred me toward philo- sophical theology, but he did. By precept (usually loud and chal- lenging) and example (more vigorous than I even to this day), he showed me that philosophy has to be genuinely systematic if it is to avoid dogmatism, and he encouraged me to build mine around theological issues. John Smith, as I said before, actually thought the ideas with which I began my systematic work. Bob Brumbaugh was also a very important influence, not only be- cause of his brilliant work on Plato, which always seemed so easy, but also because he taught how systematic philosophy has to be play. Once Bob said he agreed with John Wild that philosophy has to deal with the concrete, but he complained that Wild shouldn't have waited until it hardens. Nick Wolterstorff was my sophomore philosophy teacher in Directed Studies; I was much too unformed then for him to relate to my thinking, though years later we have come to many of the same concerns Soundings: William James used to distinguish between the once- born and the twice-born. As a philosopher, which group do you belong to? That is, have there been moments or seasons of some major changes or reversals in mind and perspective for you? Were they derived from some point at which your thinking had arrived, or were they the result of "extra-philosophical" events in your life or the life of the world? I suppose under the first, you would have Kant awakening from his dogmatic slumber or Wittgenstein sensing things had come to a dead end with the Tractatus. Under the latter, maybe Augustine becoming a Chris-</page><page sequence="6">344 SOUNDINGS tian; or (as Russell thought) Whiteheaďs son losing his life in the Great War. But maybe there have really been no radical shifts in your thinking at all. Neville: Freshman year in college I was overwhelmed and con- fused about everything, so under the influence of Vere Chappell I became a Humean. In less than an hour you can learn to divide all things into impressions and ideas and with that distinction form a philosophic opinion on all matters. (Charles Hendel had a subtler view of Hume.) Sophomore year I became an existen- tialist and met Tillich in John Smith's garden, where I served him Scotch neat. Junior year under the influence of John and Dick Bernstein (who also was John's student and Paul Weiss 's) I be- came an Hegelian-Roycean-Absolute Deweyan pragmatist. Senior year I read Peirce and became the paleo-pragmatist I am to this day. In graduate school I read much theology as well as philoso- phy, but the most important influences on determining my own direction were Bill Wiebenga, Bob Ehmann, Steve Erickson, and Carl Vaught. With the first I learned that my philosophy would be Christian but that what counts as Christian is much affected by my philosophy. From Ehmann, contrary to his intent, I learned that Kant was really wrong. With Erikson I worked through Heidegger and that great continental tradition. Debating with Vaught, I developed the basic conception of creation ex nihilo that has been my major metaphysical theme ever since. It was framed in my dissertation, which was supposed to be about Duns Scotus (under George Lindbeck's influence) but which turned out to be my own theory of creation. The rewritten dissertation was published as God the Creator, which Tom Altizer calls my last good book. Since the Ph.D. my thinking has continuously expanded to em- brace new perspectives and topics. For instance, I devoted myself to comparative philosophy beginning at Fordham in the late 1960s; then medical ethics at the Hastings Center in the early 1970s. In graduate school I had learned almost no social philoso- phy, never read Marx, and had not been stimulated to do social science. In the decade after that, I poured myself into that litera- ture which showed up in The Cosmology of Freedom (1974). At SUNY Purchase I learned, so as to teach, Sanskrit, from Tom Berry. He also arranged for me to study, though I did not learn,</page><page sequence="7">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 345 Chinese. But I did begin the study of Taijichuan with Sophia Delza and continued with her for twelve years. I taught Taiji at Stony Brook for ten years and still practice it regularly; it is my real cultural introduction to Chinese philosophy. These and many other things were novel amplifications of my early philo- sophic stance, but I don't think they created any critical reversals. Of course, every time there is a significant change, everything in the past changes too. But I am still a Methodist from Missouri, even if that is understood now in terms of the fact I am a Boston Confucian (my book Boston Confucianism will come out somewhat later). Perhaps the most dramatic example of this incremental growth was occasioned by the death of our first daughter, Gwendolyn, in 1966 when she was 4 months old. Shortly after that, I had to go over the copyedited version of God the Creator, and came to the passage where I quoted with approval the line from Job that the Lord gives and the Lord takes away - blessed be the name of the Lord. Could I leave that in? After much agony, I found that I had to keep that affirmation and emphasize it. Because her short life had so little worth in historical or temporal terms, it focused for me the task of really understanding eternity. Brahman, the Dao, God the Creator - have never been mere abstractions for me but ways of engaging the depths of life that were far too deep in 1966. Soundings: How early did you develop the intense interest in cross-cultural philosophy that is so pronounced in your work? Isn't this interest something of an aberration in the mainstream of American, Anglican, and Continental philosophy? Neville: It all started one day in the late 1960s when I was stand- ing next to Tom Berry at Fordham. He asked what I was teach- ing, and I answered history of philosophy. Then he asked what texts I used for Indian and Chinese philosophy. Well, of course I had never thought of those philosophies but instantly recognized how stupid I was not to have. I couldn't think of any answer at all before it was time to zip up and leave (now you know where we were standing), so he signed me up to teach both Indian and Chinese philosophy. He tutored me through the first years, and I quickly came to see that calling philosophy "Western" is just as parochial as it would be to say that it is only German or French.</page><page sequence="8">346 SOUNDINGS Over the years, many friends such as Tu Weiming, Frank Clooney, David Eckel, and John Berthrong have come to realize that the way to minimize the damage I would do to the traditions they love is to instruct me. And so I have had many very good teachers. The recently completed Cross-Cultural Comparative Religious Ideas Project at Boston University is one of the most fulsome collaborations of scholars across cultural traditions ever to have happened. Three volumes of its discussions will come out from SUNY in 2000. Contemporary academic philosophy in America is pretty blind to comparative philosophy. By the time it wakes up to India and China, the traditional philosophies of Africa and the Americas, as well as Islam, will be at the forefront of everyone else's paideia. That I chanced into the world of religious studies where seri- ous philosophy is done has saved me from academic philosophy. The world philosophic conversation will come from religion, not the Western philosophic academy. I should say in this regard that Tom Altizer and Ray Hart, whom I came to know so well through the religious studies academy, were profound influences on my philosophy/ theology. I dedicated my Theology Primer, a textbook for seminarians, to Tom, who is the most ecclesiastically con- cerned theologian I know, despite his rhetoric. Soundings: There's quite an array of important philosophical voices lined up in Interpreting Neville - Frankenberry, Allan, Ford, Brown, Corrington, Wyschogrod. Which of these essays seems to you now to offer the strongest critique of your philoso- phy? Has caused you to undertake the most searching revisitng of your positions? Neville: Clearly the most potent critique is Robert Corrington's, and for two reasons. First, of all the essayists his response inte- grates the most elements and parts of my system. Most of the others pick up on some one aspect, and since I've written about so many things it sometimes seems as if they are writing about different philosophers. Corrington understands me most thor- oughly, although several others are very good at that. Because of this, his criticism counts a great deal. Second, Robert makes a genuine bottom line assessment, namely, that, taken altogether, my philosophy does not register the right depth of sadness in the universe. If that is so, then I'm really wrong, but importantly</page><page sequence="9">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 347 wrong. The issue turns on whether I escape anthropomorphism in my theory of value, which he says I don't, or whether he in fact anthropomorphizes too much in talking about sadness in the cosmos. My whole system leads me to my view, as does his to his view. There are other important criticisms, of course. Nancy Frankenberry attacks my pragmatic theory of reference for relig- ious symbols by appealing to Davidson's kind of pragmatism. I'm still persuaded that Peirce's pragmatism, which I follow, is ahead. Marjorie Suchocki accuses me of failing to be sensitive to femi- nist issues because I use gendered religious symbols such as the Earth Mother and the Sky God. She says all such symbols stereo- type women. She might be right, and of course my own philo- sophical concept of God is abstracter than which one cannot get, surely not the Big Guy in the Sky. But I'm reluctant to give up the rich resonances of gendered symbols even if we have to guard against the abuses to which feminists point. Soundings: Several of the writers in Interpreting Neville think you have problems with symbolic meaning, and perhaps with the di- verse uses of language. This sort of concern, we suspect, lies be- hind the reluctance of a great many theologians and philosophers of our time to take systematic metaphysical work seriously. So many see in Rorty's warning against making philoso- phy into a purported "mirror of reality" a reflection of their own suspicions about the reliability of language to do more than "de- scribe" (Rorty's term) reality. Two American metaphysicians of an early generation - Weiss and Hartshorne - might have seemed oblivious to the fragility of language. Some would say they had no sense of irony with respect to language. Weiss titled his first book Reality, which strikes many today as more than slightly comic. Clearly these critics see in American pragmatism a counsel of suspicion of language, whereas you see a different kind of resource. Neville: Wait a minute. You've unloaded the whole deconstruc- tionist critique on metaphysics here, to which I want to respond by making some distinctions, beginning with a comment on rhet- oric. Weiss's Reality was named to be a critique of his teacher Whitehead's Process and Reality (Weiss rejected the process of ac- tual occasions for a substance view) which in turn was a rhetori-</page><page sequence="10">348 SOUNDINGS cal critique of Bradley's Appearance and Reality. Deconstructionists are supposed to be sensitive to history and context: why not read the metaphysicians that way? Whom do you suppose Hartshorne was opposing with his title The Divine Relativity? Now a proper (Peircean) semiotic would say that interpreta- tion has three main problematics: the reference of signs, the meanings of signs, and the contextual interpretation of signs. The pragmatists called serious attention to the last, and postmodernists also claim to be focusing on interpretive context when they get excited about signs as expressions of social power. Semioticians of the European (Saussure's) school focus on the meaning of signs as determined by the codes of semiotic systems. In religious studies we have become conscious of the vast num- bers of different sign systems that interplay in complex interpre- tations, systems that overlap, resonate with one another, or that serve as limitations and correctives. Because of the complexity of symbol systems, it is always nearly impossible to give the "plain meaning" of an important assertion in religion or philosophy, especially systematic metaphysics. The problem of reference is the sleeper, however. Both Kan- tians and most British empiricists, as well as nearly all nominal- ists, believe that there is no real reference of signs to reality outside of sign systems. The problems of representative percep- tion fostered this skepticism about reference. And also, the fact that the form of any interpretation that might engage some ex- ternal reality can also be registered within a sign system means that any putative reference can be reduced to the expression of it in a sign system. Now Peirce's theory says there are three modes of reference, that of icons, of indices, and conventions. Conven- tional signs are like language and do refer within semiotic sys- tems; they make the connections between areas of representation. Iconic reference is when reality is taken to be like what the signs say. A cross on an altar is an icon of the cross of Jesus' crucifixion - Peirce's example. But any verbal descrip- tion, be it an attempt to have one-to-one isomorphism as the early positivists sought or an attempt to describe the indescrib- able through metaphors, is iconic insofar as it says "the real ob- ject is like this. . . ." Rorty criticizes metaphysics as if it were only iconic.</page><page sequence="11">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 349 The neglected kind of reference is indexical. An index is a sign referring in such a way as to set up a causal relation between the object and the interpretation of it, as a pointing finger gets us to turn our heads to see. An indexical reference determines some- thing of our orientation to objects. Most big-deal religious sym- bols have a powerful indexical component insofar as they serve to transform the interpreter by accommodating the interpreter's soul better to the religious object. Indexical reference is the causal component in interpretation that allows interpreters to be really engaged with things outside of their meaning schemes. Ar- istotle's claim that perception and the knowledge derivative from perception comes through touch is an example of recognition of the indexical mode of reference. Whitehead's theory of prehen- sion, underlying experience in the mode of causal efficacy, is a late recognition that other modern philosophies had lost sight of indexicality. A metaphysical system like Whitehead's, Weiss's, Hartshorne's, or mine refers in all three modes. Obviously they are special lin- guistic systems. Also, they attempt iconically to describe how things are when interpreted with those linguistic systems. But they also refer indexically, engaging us in better or worse ways with the reality to which the systems refer. Robert Corrington's criticism of my system for not properly registering cosmic sadness is as much indexical as iconic - my system does not let us en- gage the world's sadness enough, he says; it does not give us a true or authentic orientation to the world. My counterclaim is that my system puts our response to the world's sadness in the right place. So to the deconstructionists and postmodernists who say meta- physics cannot refer, I say that their assumed metaphysics couldn't recognize reference if they tripped on it. Of course merely iconic or descriptive reference cannot justify itself unless there is also a causal connection as in a scientific experiment, or in looking again, or in living with a metaphysics to see how it orients life. The pragmatic theory of interpretation integrates reference, meaning systems, and contextual interpretation. An interpreta- tion takes its object to be referentially represented by its signs in the respects in which the signs stand for the objects. The inter- pretive context as well as the character of the sign-system deter-</page><page sequence="12">350 SOUNDINGS mine just those respects in which the signs stand for the objects. The upshot of this is that any metaphysical system interprets real- ity in just the respects allowed by its symbols and the interpretive context of its interpreters. No system reproduces reality, nor does it mirror reality except perhaps in certain respects. Deconstruc- tionists attribute to metaphysicians a kind of arrogance that sim- ply cannot pass the pragmatic test. No one gets the "whole truth." There is no such thing as the whole truth. Only the truths of interpretation in various respects. The fun parts of metaphysics have to do with comparing sys- tems to see the different respects in which they interpret reality, and then constructing systems that register all those respects - my version of Hegelian dialectic. The fun parts also include set- ting up experiential ways to test the orientations that systems fos- ter. The compelling part of metaphysics, however, is its obligation to provide good signs for engaging the breadth and depth of reality. Without signs for them, we cannot recognize and hence relate to realities, or dimensions of reality. Reality we don't recognize can bruise us. But it can also just slip by unno- ticed. Disciplined metaphysics pushes us to engage more accu- rately, to correct for the blinders in other parts of our meaning systems, or the biases of our interpretive contexts. A metaphysi- cally vital age is one that has its eyes open and is vulnerable to instruction. I fear that the deep conservatism of deconstruction and postmodernism, so fearful of missing a nuance, leads to dis- engagement and preoccupation with navel-gazing. Sorry for the philosophic blast. But I get tired of people telling me that I can't do what I've done for years, all because they as- sume that what I do, metaphysics, is the dumb thing that Kant said it is. To go back to your point about suspicion, postmodernists get excited about suspecting symbol-systems. The real object of suspicion should be the operative cultural meta- physics by which we engage our world, usually unconsciously, a suspicion that can be developed only by developing a responsible metaphysics. Soundings: Let's talk about several other Robert Nevilles besides the metaphysician. Maybe you don't think they are different Nevilles, but the same person in a different guise only with the same agenda.</page><page sequence="13">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 351 For instance, what about your music? We know that in addition to having a very fine voice you are the librettist for at least one opera, The Last Words of Sisera, which has not yet been produced but which Soundings published a few years ago. This opera, like many others, is based on a Biblical theme, albeit not a well- known one. Have you had occasion to reflect out loud (in pub- lic) on the theological importance of opera? Do you have any- thing to say to your seminarians about this, or is opera to you like, say, birdwatching is to Hartshorne? Neville: Your problem - actually your blessing - is that you ha- ven't heard me sing. The chief characteristic of my voice is that it is very low, in range, quality, and sound. What I have in excess is gall - I'll sing anywhere. As to the libretto, it indicates both my conviction that ideas need expression in imaginative forms and my recognition that music is the imaginative form for which the soul is most hard- wired. Of all the Western musical forms, opera penetrates most deeply from the civilized level of highly reflected language through the limbic system into the meters, dynamic expansions, and melodic rises and falls of the soul. A libretto is just the verbal semiotic surface of an opera, but it does suggest deeper musical soul-themes. Sisera, for instance, is about life and death (of course), sanity and madness (of course), politics and violence (of course), friendship and betrayal (of course), and so far is like most Italian operas of the last century. But it is also about per- spectives: brigand Israel's versus civilized Canaan's, women's ver- sus men's, parents' versus children's, and most important the divine perspective, choosing Israel yet equally bound to Canaan. This is the only opera I know that both questions and affirms the tilt of the universe, its denial of any concrete basic equilibrium, as symbolized in the choice of Israel. Yahweh, of course, is a very low bass. Soundings: While you have been doing all that metaphysics in re- cent years, you've been a dean at a great American university. Granted that Plato talked about the need for philosopher kings, most of us would see your deaning and your thinking {Diakonen und Denken, as Heidegger might say) as a couple of rather oppo- site activities. But we note that you are a dean at a university where the president is a Yale-trained Kant expert - a philoso-</page><page sequence="14">352 SOUNDINGS pher, no less. Many of us wonder, what is it like to dean for John Silber? As president he managed to persuade a great many first- rate minds and talents to join Boston University. Is it a great ad- vantage in such a university setting to be dealing with a man who knows his Plato and his Kant, or does it make any difference? Neville: Like most people who hear I work at Boston University, your real interest is in John Silber. So let me talk about him first and then get back to your polite question about what deaning means to me. John has been a great university president, probably the great- est of his generation, bringing Boston University into the ranks of the major research universities across the curriculum. Long before John, Boston University was known for its personalist phi- losophy and theology and for its extraordinary development of social ethics under Walter Muelder, including the activism sym- bolized by Martin Luther King, Jr. Many readers of this journal, cognizant of that important history in religion and related hu- manities, and of the social and political commitment of the Uni- versity, might not appreciate just how far Silber had to bring Boston University in other areas to have the position it does. Not only did he bring in good people, as you say, but he raised money, built laboratories, and got the University engaged in all the publics appropriate to its schools and disciplines. His com- mitment to the Chelsea Public School System extended the moral commitment of the University from its religious establish- ment to the School of Education (deaned by another philoso- pher, Ed DeLattre). All of this is being continued by his successor as president, Jon Westling. As to his philosophic background, of course that is important. He has thought deeply about both the problems and opportuni- ties of higher education in our time, and the directions he has chosen have not been the obvious ones. Because he argues strongly for his views and doesn't bother to tell others their views are respectable when he thinks they aren't, he is not only prickly but colorful. He doesn't much respect people who are afraid to defend their views, and he communicates that disrespect. You can imagine how that goes over in an environment in which be- ing made to feel uncomfortable is grounds for suit!</page><page sequence="15">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 353 As to my getting along with John, he has pretty much left me alone to lead the School of Theology, providing strong support when asked. IVe strongly disagreed with him about some things, personnel matters, for instance, and even policy. He has a nega- tive rhetoric about hiring experts in non-Western cultures be- cause he thinks that leads to a shallow multi-culturalism where easy things are celebrated and nothing hard gets learned. The study of religion, even in theology school, has been multi-cultural for two centuries, and so I dismiss his argument as aimed else- where. And despite his rhetoric he has supported me in develop- ing strength in our religion department and School of Theology in Chinese religion, Buddhism, and African religions, supple- menting strength in Islam that long predates me. Now as to my own deaning, I have been the chair or other administrator of everything I have been in since 1966. This has not been for Plato's reason, namely, that the price of not gov- erning is to be governed by someone less good than oneself. On the contrary, I think part of being in the world is to care for the institutions of our lives. Many people think that way about fami- lies, but my world is also the academic and religious world (I'm a church bureaucrat as well as academic dean - by virtue of being a denominational seminary dean). I could never live with myself without being attentive to academic institutions. I now under- stand myself to be a Confucian scholar-official. The job as dean of theology at Boston University brought together my life-long religious commitment, including ordination, with my administra- tive experience, my devotion to teaching - I teach a full load though doubtless less well than I would if it were my only job - and my life as a thinker. Keeping all these things going, plus be- ing attentive to my family, requires a lot of energy and support from others, both of which I have so far. My wife, Beth, has simi- lar energy with an equally wide range of commitments, and we reinforce as well as support one another. Soundings: You have just published a fine collection of sermons, The God Who Beckons: Theology in the Farm of Sermons. These are addresses you have given mostly in Marsh Chapel but also at Trinity College in Cambridge, and at Korean churches and Afri- can American churches. In these sermons you employ no fancy theological language. You do not, to use a distinction that</page><page sequence="16">354 SOUNDINGS Jonathan Z. Smith always tells us is important, speak in second- order language but in first-order language. One would not know you were a metaphysician. Or would she? Are you serious in say- ing that these sermons are really theological reflection? Neville: How could I preach from the heart without revealing the theology that's there? The sermons are all about God, no matter what the text. But I am a textual preacher, usually using the lec- tionary, and think of preaching as an imaginative art. It should be poetic, in the Greek sense of being creative. In this case, ser- mons should be creative of holier souls in those to whom they are addressed. These sermons preach the God of creative will, grace, overwhelming and sometimes wasteful love, and some un- fairness, the God of Sisera. I agree with those many theologians who say God is not a being, not a thing, not in a genus, being being and non-being, beyond good and evil. So I'm something of a Scotist rather than a Thomist, believing that God's will "pre- cedes" God's nature rather than the other way around. But it's silly to put it that way in sermons. I don't experience God as the One, Pure Being, Quiet Nothingness, but as aboriginal and eter- nal Act, Crazy Yahweh. Fortunately for preaching, the Bible is on my side (at least most of the time). Soundings: Let's return, here at the last of this all-too-brief con- versation, to your dialogue with the Whiteheadians. You have written a lot about Whitehead and process philosophy over the years, and process thinkers such as John Cobb, Marjorie Su- chocki, Lewis Ford, Delwin Brown, David Hall, and Don Sherburne have been among your closest interlocutors. Your doctoral students include Elizabeth Kraus, Robert Meliert, Jo- seph Hallman, and Steve Odin, all of whom have published in the area of process philosophy. Yet your book Creativity and God is an attempt to reject process theology root and branch. How do you explain this, and how do you see your relation to Whitehead and his school? Neville: Whitehead was the singular thinker in this past century who proved that systematic philosophy or metaphysics on the grand scale is possible by actually doing it. Esse is the best proof of posse. I agree more with Peirce than Whitehead, I think, and Peirce thought the way around Kant before Whitehead by show-</page><page sequence="17">Interview with Robert Cummings Neville 355 ing how philosophy's systems are great hypotheses. But White- head worked out a magnificent system in great detail, which Peirce never did. Moreover, Whiteheaďs followers from Wieman and Hartshorne down to our contemporaries maintained a disci- plined technical approach to philosophy that advanced greatly on others who vaguely supported "becoming," "temporality," and other process themes. Moreover, and perhaps more to the point, when I published God the Creator in 1968, the process philosophers and the Thomists were the only ones who paid attention. Few others thought metaphysics was possible, and only those movements had the easy assumption that, of course, one had to make long and detailed arguments. Although I had studied Whitehead before publishing that book, it was only afterward, in conversa- tion with process theologians, that I devoted myself to the intrica- cies of his system and became a technical insider. I'm proud of that association and of the respect accorded my work by so many responsible process thinkers. As to major disagreements with Whitehead and his school, there are two. The first concerns God, as you noted, and is this: whereas Whitehead and Hartshorne, and the rest, clearly distin- guish God from creativity, claiming that God is an instance (how- ever prime) of creativity, I believe that creativity and God cannot be separated. There are many arguments for this. For instance, God plus creativity plus the world are more worshipful than God alone; Whiteheaďs category of the ultimate prevents a solution to the problem of the one and the many; a God who is finite but never actually determinate cannot be prehended; and so forth. These are all technical matters that have been debated in print. The second disagreement is about temporality and the endur- ance of finite things. Whitehead said that the true realities of the cosmos are momentary actual occasions that perish as soon as they have become wholly definite; on his account, a temporally enduring thing can only be a society of such occasions. Influ- enced by my teacher Paul Weiss, I think that some finite things have essential continuity of identity through time and change and are what I called "discursive individuals." This means that things have a past, present, and future all together and all chang- ing. The togetherness of a thing's past, present, and future is not temporal, never at a time, and not "all at once." Rather it is eter-</page><page sequence="18">356 SOUNDINGS nal. My account of the flow of time is that it has to be nested in eternity. Not only God but also every changing temporal thing has an "eternal identity" in my view. So if I reject process philosophy's account of process as well 21s of God, you see why my friendship with all those process thinkers is based on something other than intellectual solidarity. Or maybe intellectual solidarity is not a function of agreement but of respectful argument in good faith, in which case there is no difficulty at all seeing why my friends are who they are.
