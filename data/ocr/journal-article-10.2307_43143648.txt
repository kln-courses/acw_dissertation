<plain_text><page sequence="1">172 Central States Archaeological Journal October ; 1987 Stone and flint artifacts. The two stone pendants and a preform are of interest because the holes were first pecked to a depth, then the hole was rounded out and polished. The preform shows a pecked depression and the beginning of a hole. The Early Archaic point and the two finished pendants were found in St. Clair County, Illinois, the pendant preform was found in St. Charles County, Missouri. Wear in the holes and in the two notches on top of one is quite evident. Both are made of hardstone. The point is of interest because it was found in Illinois but the flint is from Central Missouri. It is a light tan quartzy material. It proves that Early Archaic peoples were crossing the Mississippi River.

My wife Andrea, our son Nathan, our daughter Amy and I piled into the vehicle and started toward the archaic shell banks that abound along a river in Davidson County, Tennessee. We arrived at one of our favorite sites, one that had yielded many fine artifacts of bone and of shell. Fish hooks, hair-pins and drilled needles of bone; masks, dip- pers and gorgets of shell are among the many treasures found there. It is always a collector's dream to find a "once-in-a-life-time" item, but I was scarcely prepared for the gem that we found. It lay in shell midden about three feet below the surface: a deer antler measuring in length 6.25 inches with ex- tremes of 1.25 and .75 inches in width. It was our only find of the day; but floating upon cloud nine, we hurried home to clean it and to see just what was carved upon it. A full length figurine is sculptured upon it (not incised, as is true of so many bone items that are in any way decora- tive). It is a weird likeness of human life, having skeleton-like arms and legs, a prominent breast-bone and male organs, and a faceless head that appears to be wrapped in folds of cloth or skin. I was puzzled as to its meaning and use. I still am. I could hardly wait to show my prize to my friend, Malcolm Parker. He was greatly excited. He told me that in his opinion the man-like figure was anthropomorphic and very like certain paintings found on cave walls in the Southwest United States. He also stated that the artifact in meaning could relate to death and to the artist's belief in a life after death. The relic was awarded 1st place cate- gory of bone, shell and pottery at the Wav- erly, Tennessee, show of 1986. It com- manded much atttention at Clarksville and at Baxter, Tennessee. I would like information from collec- tors throughout the Central States area. Is it one of a kind or have others like it been found? Any Easter day is special, but March 30th, 1986, 1 shall not forget. 'Possum head effigy pot, found at the Big Eddy Site in St. Francis County, Arkan- sas. It has rattles in the nose. It probably dates to about 1300 A.D.
