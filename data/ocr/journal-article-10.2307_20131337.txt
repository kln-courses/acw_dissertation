Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1997. xvi + 139 pp. Cloth, $27.95?These six lectures from the twenty first Thomas Spencer Jerome Lectures, an annual series exploring vari ous dimensions of Roman life, provide an invaluable reflection on the relationship, Pelikan's "counterpoint," between Genesis and the Ti maeus down through the ages. How did the only Platonic dialogue known in its entirety during the Middle Ages influence Judaeo-Christian cosmology? PeUkan chooses to answer this question by first discussing "Classical Rome: 'Description of the Universe (Timaeus 90E) as Philos ophy'" and Lucretius' theological and Uterary contributions to the his tory of cosmogonie speculation. In rejecting divine causality, Lucretius' atomism made room for natural science and for a teleology without ex plicit reference to direct heavenly agency. Talk of the divine was thus interpreted apophaticaUy and the poetry of de Rerum Natura aUowed the truths of what remains for us a "likely story" to be conveyed without a historical or anthropomorphic Uteralness. Lucretius' indebtedness to Epicurean materialism is obvious and as PeUkan stresses, "it was from Athens that classical Rome learned to think philosophically about cos mogony" (p. 23). In "Athens: Geneseos Arche as 'The Principle of Be coming' (Timaeus 29D-E)," PeUkan poses the fundamental questions: Why was the cosmos created? And according to what model had it been created? Plato's answer is of course that the world of becoming is an image (eikon) of an immutable and perfect model. This patterning is due to God as Goodness and his wiUing that aU things act together for a purpose. Chapter 3 continues this inquiry with "Jerusalem: Genesis as a 'Likely Account' (Timaeus 29D) of One God Almighty Maker." Here Pe likan focuses in on Jerusalem's contribution of the imago Dei. While the Timaeus defines "the terms of the counterpoint," Genesis sets "the outline and sequence" of creation (p. 45), the crowning achievement of which is the rational and sovereign human person. Therefore, whereas Plato may have understood the entire universe to be in God's image, Moses reserved this exalted position for humanity alone, a dignity PeU kan treats in his discussion of free moral choice. Chapter 4, "Alexandria: The God of Genesis as 'Maker and Father' (Ti maeus 28C)" treats Ph?o's identification of Being as found in Plato with the Creator of Moses. Quoting Ph?o's de Opificio Mundi extensively, PeUkan shows how monotheism not only rejects the Greek pantheon but preserves the goodness of a unified cosmos as weU as explains the divine Logos no longer as a mere auxiUary in the act of creation but as an essentiaUy divine Mediator. This direct manifestation of the godly is taken up in chapter 5: "New Rome: Christ as 'God Made Perceptible to the Senses,' 'Only Begotten God,' and 'Image of the God Apprehensible Only to the Mind' (Timaeus 92C)." Seeing Constantinople as the New Rome, PeUkan sees in the Cappadocian Fathers new cosmological in sights made possible by the Council of Nicaea. Because of the Incarnate Son, the material realm is even more closely united with its invisible ori gin and goal. The last lecture, "Catholic Rome: The Trinity as 'Source, Guide, and Goal' (Timaeus 27C)," accordingly examines early Trinitar ian speculation, particularly as found in Augustine and Boethius.</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 191 PeUkan brings his usual mastery and eloquence to each of these es says. Each can be read alone as commentary on selected passages of the Timaeus; Ukewise, each essay contains valuable insights into the history of cosmology. This is a highly recommended work for anyone interested in a better understanding of the Athens-Jerusalem question in general as weU as the history of cosmogonie speculation in particular.?
