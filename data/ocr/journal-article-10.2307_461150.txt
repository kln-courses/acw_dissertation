<plain_text><page sequence="1">DYLAN THOMAS AND THE "BIBLICAL RHYTHM" BY WILLIAM T. MOYNIHAN D ESPITE its appearance as a miscellaneous collection of lyrics, Dylan Thomas' poetry is a closely unified body of work. Poetic unity customarily reveals itself in cohesive imagery (what Kenneth Burke calls "symbolic equa- tions"), and in the repetition and development of related themes. Thomas' Collected Poems pos- sesses such imagistic and thematic coherence, and these images and themes, furthermore, have as their subsuming source the Bible. Every Welsh home, Thomas tells us in his prose, has a parlor with its Bible-and the Bible opens automatically at the Book of Revelation. No reader of Collected Poems can fail to notice the frequency with which Biblical characters and incidents appear.1 Nearly two-thirds of the ninety-odd poems are directly or indirectly con- cerned with material related to the Bible. More- over, Thomas' concept of divinity and the central "voice" of the poetry are both rooted in Biblical figures. But it is not the mere presence of Biblical figures that should be noted; the impor- tant thing is that the most comprehensive rela- tionship of imagery, theme, and subject matter is cast in a Biblical mold. The figures and incidents which struck Thomas' imagination were not only those which have intrigued poets for centuries, but also those which impart to the Bible its most apparent formal characteristic. As theologians, poets, and critics have long implied, and as Northrop Frye has stated explicitly, the unifying structure of the Scriptures is based on a series of movements, or ''rhythms," related to the process of creation, fall, and regeneration. The two most apparent in- stances of this rhythm are the analogous move- ments of the Pentateuch and the New Testa- ment: Christ's birth, his flight into Egypt and his "hidden life," his death and resurrection, paral- lel the creation, the Jewish captivity in Egypt and wandering in the desert, their figurative death in the death of Moses and their entrance into the promised land.2 A major point of Frye's treatment of the "Biblical rhythm" is that the Bible, by its primacy in Western thought, has been so im- pressed on the literate Western mind that almost any attempt to express total vision has recourse to some variation of the birth, fall, and regenera- tion movement. Since there are also obvious con- nections to the dying god and Jungian trans- formation archetypes, it is almost commonplace to point out some variety of "Biblical rhythm" in a literary work-or even in a group of works such as Thomas' poems or those that Frye cites: "the later poems of Eliot, of Edith Sitwell, and many Cantos of Pound."3 But, on the other hand, each artist handles the rhythm differently. Com- pare, for example, Eliot's apocalyptic vision in the Quartets with Thomas' In Country Sleep volume. The value lies not so much in pointing out the presence of total vision, but rather in noting the individuality involved in the poet's vision, in noting the particular metaphors and themes the poet uses to develop his Weltansicht. There is a rough approximation between the publication dates of Thomas' five books and the phases of the Biblical rhythm, but this approxi- 1 For a general discussion of the Bible in Thomas' prose and poetry see C]ara Lander, "With Welsh and Reverent Rook: The Biblical Element in Dylan Thomas," Queen's Quart., Ixv (Autumn 1958), 437-447. 2 Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, N. J., 1957), pp. 205, 315-326. 3 Anatomy, p. 324. Numerous articles and seven book- length studies have given little attention to the unity of the poetry. Elder Olson's The Poetry of Dylan Thomas (Chicago, 1954) is standard. While recognizing that the poetry moves through successive concerns, from the "worm beneath my nail" to the objective world and finally to an "exultant expression of faith and love," Olson does not fully develop such insights. He points out numerous connections between images, but he is reluctant to pursue these connections to their symbolic and, as I shall try to show, mythic implica- tions. "There is always a danger," Olson says, "when a poet's work exhibits some kind of rounding-out and develop- ment, that we may tend to treat his poems merely as parts of one long poem. I should like to avoid that danger" (p. 20). Collected Poems is obviously not "one long poem," but Thomas himself admitted in his famous letter to Henry Treece-Dylan Thomas: 'Dog Among the Fairies' (London, 1956), p. 37-"that each of my earlier poems might appear to constitute a section from one long poem; that is because I was not successful in making a momentary peace with my images . . . ; images were left dangling over the formal limits, and dragged the poem into another." The images continued to "dang]e over the formal limits" throughout his poetry. William York Tindall, in A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas (New York, 1962), says, "Thomas developed in theme and method from the dark early poems. . . to the sunny poems of childhood and Laugharne, but conclusions about development must be cautious; for he took one step backward for every step forward-and one step sideways" (p. 20). Though Tindall sometimes implies an imagistic unity in Collected Poems his main purpose is to explicate each of Thomas' poems, and his results in this respect are cer- tainly the most successful to date. 631</page><page sequence="2">632 Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" mation is neither precise nor important.4 There are, as should be expected, themes and images of creation, fall, and redemption throughout the poetry-just as the Flood and the rainbow covenant with Noah occur in the Old Testament long before the entry into the promised land, and just as the "Shantik shantih shantih" of The Waste Land anticipates the "Teach us to sit still" of Ash Wednesday. Thomas did not set out to treat creation, fall, and redemption succes- sively; that there is some chronological relation- ship between these themes and the publication of the poems must be regarded as the result of un- conscious factors. The pervasive influence of the Bible certainly had much to do with his treat- ment of these subjects. And age-his shift from an obsession with genesis and womb, to the ob- jective world that suffers and loves, to the formu- lation of a vision of perpetuity-surely had just as much to do with the shape the poetry as- sumed. In fact, rather than the early poetry building toward the thematic unity of the later poetry, the opposite would appear to be the case -the final poems bring out the thematic and symbolic unity inherent in the early poems. In his world of creation, for example, Thomas de- scribes not an Edenic universe, but-as does Blake-a world which falls in the very moment of creation. As the poetry moves along, from Incarnate Devil to Fern Hill, furthermore, he comes to align his concept of creation more with the Biblical story-he supplies an "Eden" to precede the "Fall." It is relatively late in his poetry that he comes to realize that "the legend / Of Adam and Eve is never for a second / Silent in my service" (p. 145).5 And it is, finally, in the poem written to introduce Collected Poems that he comes-with hesitation, self-consciousness, and some self-depreciation-to assume the Noah persona, a persona which epitomizes his regen- erative vision. Regardless of Thomas' intentions and regard- less of chronological imprecision, his poetry is unified by a "Biblical rhythm." The details of that rhythm can be clearly established by a con- sideration of the images and themes of (1) crea- tion, (2) fall, and (3) redemption or regeneration. I Thomas liked to describe his early work as from his "womb-tomb" period. Despite the tongue-in-cheek tone, the description is apt in that birth, and birth's irreversible impetus to- ward death, dominate the thought and imagery of the early poetry. Human generation, however, was not the only creation he was interested in- he was also obsessed by thoughts of the creation of the world and of poetry. These three types of creation are not always separable. In each the work of the other is implied and in each the procreative functions of man are metaphorically present.6 Since Thomas saw the origin of the universe as analogous to man's, it naturally followed that cosmic and sexual activities could be seen as comparable functions. Thus the moment of con- ception is depicted as light breaking "where no sun shines," and the process of embryonic growth takes place when "the fruit of man un- wrinkles in the stars" (p. 29). Similarly, sperm about to fertilize is said to be "from the star- flanked fields of space" (p. 51), much as creative light issues out of the void. Thomas, however, did not conceive of the uni- verse as entirely anthropomorphic. While his view was generally identical with Blake's view that "God only Acts and Is, in existing beings and men,"7 his poetry never completely dis- carded the transcendent and autonomous God of the Welsh chapel. It is obvious, as Tindall says, that "God and Christ are always around in Thomas' poetry-not in their proper capacities, however, but as metaphors for nature, poet, and their creative powers."8 Language, especially poetic language, is de- I Ralph Maud, in "Dylan Thomas' Collected Poems: Chronology of Composition," PMLA, LXXVI (June 1961), 292-297, cautions against conclusions based on the sequence of Collected Poems. However, as Maud would seem to agree (see his fn. 3, p. 292), general statements about the sequence may still be valid. Furthermore, where there is a lapse of years between the first draft and its pub]ication, the pub- lished version is seldom the "same" poem. Generally speak- ing, 18 Poems develops images and themes of creation, Twenty-Five Poems (1936) and The Map of Love (1939) de- velop notions of the fallen world. Deaths and Entrances (1946) and In Country Sleep (1952) provide the fullest de- velopment of the regeneration concept. But the recognition of a successive rhythmic movement is not contingent upon any precise consideration of chronology. 5 All page references to Thomas' poems refer to Collected Poems (New York, 1953, 1957). 6 To name three concurrent leve]s of interpretation is not to exclude other innumerable lines of suggestiveness. But it would be both confusing and unrewarding to exp]ore all possible reverberations of meaning in this study. I have, wherever possible, tried to indicate relationships between levels of meaning; at other times I have had to settle for what I consider the subsuming level of meaning. 7 "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," The Complete Writings of William Blake, ed.

In any attempt to speak of God, one must use the finite, inevitably meta- phoric, terms of human speech. Genesis describes creation as something which was spoken by God, man as the "image" of God, Eden as "planted," and God as "walking in the garden in the cool of the day." In Job xxxviii, Jehovah speaks "out of the whirlwind" and asks, "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?" and "When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling-band for it." Although Thomas identifies the Poet with the Word of the Gospels (John i.1), using each as a metaphor for the other, the first speaker of the Word, the Jehovah of Genesis and the God of Job, hovers in the background. Thomas had recourse, at least as poet, to traditional ideas of God, before Whom his typical posture is that of petitioner, intercessor, pilgrim (see, for example, pp. 97, 115, 132, 143, 160, 181, 192, 197). The influence of Blake, Joyce, and Lawrence helped to make him something of a vitalist and a pantheist, and he was certainly at times a scoffer-"Every morning I make / God in bed, good and bad" (p. 150). That Thomas rejected the hypocrisy he saw in various forms of Christianity obviously does not mean that he rejected the possibility of metaphoric truth in the Christian "myth." He says as much in his prefatory note to Collected Poems: "I read somewhere of a shepherd who, when asked why he made, from within fairy rings, ritual observances to the moon to protect his flocks, replied: 'I'd be a damn' fool if I didn't.' These poems, with all their crudities, doubts, and confusions, are written for the love of Man and in praise of God, and I'd be a damn' fool if they weren't." Despite the fact that Thomas, like almost all modern poets, seems never to have made up his mind on precise theological points, he did once give a definition of God which is meaningful, even if somewhat jocose. He called Him the "godhead, the author, the milky-way farmer, the first cause, architect, lamp-lighter, quintes- sence, the beginning Word, the anthropomorphic bowler-out and black-baller, the stuff of all men, scapegoat, martyr, maker, woe-bearer."9 There are, it may be noticed, three separate groupings in the phrases Thomas uses. He describes a God of creation, a God of attrition, a God of love. The God of creation is "godhead ..., the milky-way farmer, the first cause . . ., quintes- sence, the beginning Word." In general terms this Creator resembles the God of the Old Testa- ment. Thomas' God of creation is further re- lated to Blake's Nobodaddy; it is He who made both the lamb and the tiger, both man and the serpent, both Adam and the devourers of Adam -sex and time. He is an evolutionary God who created life and death out of the sea, "This was the god of beginning in the intricate seawhirl" (p. 44). The God of attrition, "the anthropomorphic bowler-out and black-baller," is a god of time and destruction, of the wearing-away of life. Thomas ridicules the traditional depictions of such a vengeful God-"Shall gods be said to thump the clouds / When clouds are cursed by thunder?" (p. 52). But he makes of time, if not a god of vengeance, at least a spirit of evil: "with his torch and hourglass, like a sulphur priest, / His beast heel cleft in a sandal" (p. 92). And there are in Thomas' concepts of time strong overtones of the manichean divinity of evil. It is time that "cast forth my mortal crea- ture" (p. 9), it is time that tracks man down "like a running grave" (p. 21), it is time that murders (p. 79). All three aspects of divinity can be found throughout the poetry, but there is a general shift in emphasis. The more the God of time gives way to the God of love the more we recog- nize His human qualities, but paradoxically, the more permanent becomes His presence. Despite this absolutism, the God of love is the "stuff of all men, scapegoat, martyr, maker, woe-bearer." Thomas, for example, merges the God of Genesis who "walked on the earth in the evening / Counting the denial of the grains" (p. 173) with the mythic Prometheus "who blew the great fire in / And died on a hiss of flames." This God "weeps like the risen sun among / The liquid choirs of his tribes," as does Thomas' God in In Country Heaven10 who stands weeping over His earth as it destroys itself. It is He whom the poet cannot fathom, but that he knows is true-al- though he can find no assurance for knowing it (p. 191). Set in and against this theocentric background is a view of man as spirit, or ghost, imprisoned in flesh. Man's imperfect origin is reflected pri- marily in a flesh-spirit, metal-ghost antagonism, "the ghost is dumb that stammered in the straw" (p. 36). In dreaming of his rebirth after death, the poet describes the "second / Rise of 9 Quite Early One Morning (New York, 1954), pp. 178-179. 10 I am indebted to John Malcolm Brinnin for access to this manuscript which is in his possession.</page><page sequence="4">634 Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" the skeleton and / Rerobing of the naked ghost" (p. 34). It is from the idea of flesh being a prison of the spirit that the images of "flesh's armour" (p. 8) and of man being "forged" in minerals (pp. 40, 44) make sense. All men are imprisoned by their contraries, body and spirit, "bonerailed and masterless" (p. 40). Because man is an imperfect being, a sinner, man is the unwitting source of much of the evil in the world. He does evil and he prevents the realization of the good, "the hours' ladder to the sun" has been "monkeyed by the blood of man" (p. 32). Man is made in the image of God, born out of the sea from "Adam's brine," but inherently sinful, "The patchwork halves were cloven as they scudded" (p. 35). Mankind is climbing a ladder of which the sides are "of Adam," made in the image of God, and the rungs are "of Abaddon," inherently evil (Sonnet II, p. 80). Thomas' imagistic link between the God of genesis and the "stuff of all men," between the creator of the universe and the creature of the world, is Christ. It is because Christ is the "stuff of all men" that God is, too. The relationship is both historical-"I who was shapeless as the water / That shaped the Jordan near my home," and eternal-"Was brother to Mnetha's daughter / And sister to the fathering worm" (p. 8).11 Since Christ is not only God but also a human being, all men, and especially the Poet, can be seen as Christ figures. The "Jack Self" of Hopkins becomes Jack Christ for Thomas: "My Jack of Christ born thorny on the tree" (p. 15). The central figure of Collected Poems is an Adam- Christ-Poet composite-the representative of suffering, crucified humanity. The poet hears dead men on the battlefield "Cry Eloi"-the cry of Christ on the cross-from the "hill of bones" (p. 36)-an allusion to the hill of skulls, Golgotha. The same identification is involved in Vision and Prayer, which has to do with the birth of a child who is both any human being and also Christ. But, although Christ is an aspect of God, and man is a figure of Christ, man is not identi- fied with God. The "godhead," the "first cause," the "quintessence," remains above and beyond the created world of man and Christ. The created world is the physical manifesta- tion of God, or by analogy, a figure of Christ. This is why "the long world's gentleman" can be said to "share my bed with Capricorn and Cancer" (Sonnet I, p. 80). This is why the rain- bow of the covenant (Genesis ix.11-15) can be described as extending "from my nipples / From pole to pole . . . round the snail-waked world" (Sonnet VIII). And the evil and suffering in the world are therefore also God's wound, God's pain. The whole world-body metaphor, which is so basic to Thomas' poetic vision, and which has been so often noticed by his readers, is derived from this figural analogy of man-Christ-world. The sea, for example, can be like the blood of man and it can also be seen as the blood of Christ, "The sea sound flowing like blood from the loud wound" (p. 153). The retelling of the opening of Genesis takes on characteristics of human generation in In the Beginning (p. 27). The light from the star (three- pointed to suggest both the Trinity and perfec- tion) creates with "one smile of light" which breaks across "an empty face"-not empty space as we might expect. The "bough of bone" is a variation of the rib of Adam from which Eve (and thereby the human race) was created. While Thomas' universe may begin with a gentle fiat of a three-pointed star, it proceeds by contradictions and oppositions-"Heaven and hell mixed as they spun," or, like human gen- eration, it proceeds by division or a kind of cellular mitosis-"the substance forked that marrowed the first sun."'2 "Forking" is one of Thomas' favorite images in his early poetry to express the idea of growth by division: "The seed that makes a forest of the loin / Forks half its fruit" (p. 6). "From the divorcing sky," Thomas says, "I learnt the double / The two- framed globe that spun into a score." Sperm and egg are seen as "bisected shadows on the thunder's bone / [that] Bolt for the salt unborn" (p. 35). In view of the dependence of one sub- stance on another, cell on cell, man on woman, creature on creator, all the halves are imperfect: "The broken halves are fellowed in a cripple, / The crutch that marrow taps upon their sleep" (p. 35). Human beings are cripples because they cannot create alone; they are dependent upon the living marrow in their bones (and, imper- 11 Mnetha is a character that Thomas derived from his reading of Blake. S. Foster Damon, William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols (Boston, 1924), p. 72, says: Mnetha is a "woman aged but strong . .. protectress of arts." See also Olson, p. 99. For a possible Blakean echo in the worm reference compare Blake's "Gate of Paradise" (Plate 16): "I have said to the Worm thou / Art my mother and my father." 12 "Without contraries there is no progression," says Blake in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and goes on: "Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence." Keynes, p. 149.</page><page sequence="5">William T. Moynihan 635 fectly, on each other) and thereby subject to death and decay. The inherent conflict in creation is, then, life versus death. The point of view of Thomas' treatment of creation is like that of Adam when he first perceived death. He is too close to the horror of the revelation to think of how "green" was the beginning. In Thomas' subsequent poetry the "Eden" of instinctive life, of child- hood, and of nature will be depicted. But at the outset "the womb / Drives in a death as life leaks out" (p. 6). Divine creation begins when the "twilight locks" are no longer confined to the "long worm" of God's finger (p. 4), when the waters of death are no longer confined within God. ("Locks" in Thomas, although Freudian in some cases, are better understood here in their literal sense of anything that holds, or confines something.) Even calling God's finger a worm (from the pic- torial representations of God by both Blake and Michelangelo perhaps) conveys the creator- destroyer meaning. For the worm is both crea- tive, "the fathering worm" (p. 8), and destruc- tive, "the worm beneath my nail / Wearing the quick away" (p. 14). Just as foreboding in this description of the beginning of life is the image of time hungrily nourishing itself on the galactic breasts of God. This diabolical creature nourished of God comes shortly to nourish itself on man and the world: "The lips of time leech to the fountain head" (p. 10). Time, however, is more important as a symbol in the fallen world than it is in the world of creation. First come the worm and its cognates (serpent, maggot, crocodile), signifying that in- herent in creation is sin, fall-or, more directly- death. Incarnate Devil (p. 46) is a whole poem dealing with this concept. Thomas says here that evil is an integral aspect of creation, that the "circle" (the cycle of life) was "stung awake" by the "incarnate devil in a talking snake." In mytho- logical terms "the garden gods / Twined good and evil on an eastern tree," but what it all comes down to is that "a serpent fiddled in the shaping-time." It is important to note that God is characterized in the first stanza as "a fiddling warden" who "played down pardon from the heaven's hill." The creator, too, is indifferent to the inevitable sinfulness of his creation. Good and evil are inextricably intertwined. The world that divinity shaped and the world that the poet shapes are symbolically joined both by the poet's purpose and by the way he creates. His purpose is to show the truth of the created world, to reveal the crocodile: "I, in a wind on fire, from green Adam's cradle, / No man more magical, clawed out the crocodile" (p. 44). To "claw out the crocodile" is to reveal sin and death. (This idea is analogous to that of the "biting man," p. 65, and to biting out the mandrake in Sonnet I, as well as to Job XLI.1, "Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord . . .?") The poet has the same task as the Creator. He is "the brassy orator / Laying my ghost in metal" (p. 40). He who is already aware of being a spirit imprisoned in flesh by God feels the further necessity of expressing his "ghost" in printed form. In terms parallel to the previous stanza's description of the evolutionary creation of man, the third stanza of I, in My Intricate Image describes the creation of a poem. Like the evangelical world of St. John, and the cosmology of the Cabala,"3 the poetical world of Dylan Thomas begins with the word, "In the beginning was the word" (p. 27). The void is the world of letters, unorganized, chaotic. From this prima materia comes the word. Words, once they are part of man's being, "translate" to the heart the elementary facts of human existence-birth and death. Thomas finds the knowledge of death more deadening than the fact of death itself, "The words of death are dryer than his stiff" (p. 15). The flesh of man is the "declension" by which the disorganized body of words is brought into meaningful relationship and the means by which the poet learns "to twist the shapes of thoughts / Into the stony idiom of the brain" (p. 25). Like the creations of God (man, world, time), the creations of the poet bring death. The talking of his "busy heart" makes him shed his "syl- labic blood" (p. 19). The great shaper is God "Who gave these seas their colour in a shape" (p. 70), and the poet as shaper of words partakes of this creative function. Now, Thomas says, God can shape me back to clay-"make the world of me," just as I have taken the sights and sounds of "your walking circle"-the world, round and always turning-and shaped them into poetry, a "merry manshape." (That these lines may also support a sexual interpretation 13 "The En-Soph creates by means of numbers and letters. The thirty-two 'instruments of God' are the ten primordial numbers to which all numbers can be reduced and the twenty-two fundamental letters of the Hebrew alphabet to which all words can be reduced." John Senior, The Way Down and Out (Ithaca, N. Y., 1959), p. 25.</page><page sequence="6">636 Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" does not negate the poetic one. As usual, Thomas may be describing all types of creation by means of a single metaphor.) The poet who "clawed out the crocodile" of life will be turned back into dust by the croco- dile's counterpart, the maggot or the worm. Thus "Joy is the knock of dust" (p. 22). But the dust of the earth is the source of new life, all the "dry worlds" are constantly flowering again through both human and natural generation. Even the grains of sand are "multiplying"- "Each golden grain spat life into its fellow" (p. 24). They too take part in the whole world's male and female generative impulse, as in Into Her Lying Down Head-"Two sand grains to- gether in bed" (p. 127). All of nature is con- stantly creating. "Four elements and five / Senses, and man a spirit in love" (p. 193)-these are the prime images of creating nature. In the perfect crea- tion, creation viewed without the presence of destructive time, all the four elements move in ideal union-"Earth, air, water, fire, singing into the white act" (p. 185). Such a view of creation, however, is not present in the early poetry for the very reason that that world has not yet been redeemed from the scourges of time. The four elements taken individually sym- bolize different aspects of creativity. The images of creation drawn from the earth-tree, flower, grass-are secondary to the major symbolic role of the earth, or "dust," which manifests itself especially in the later poems as an image of re- creation or universal renewal. At the outset the functions and products of earth are used as signs of fertility and productivity of the most ordinary kind: "I should tell summer from the trees, the worms / Tell . .. the winter's storms" (p. 53). (It is in the redeemed earth of the later poetry that "the dead oak walks for love," p. 134.) Thomas uses "flower" to indicate the beauty as well as the productivity of nature's creation- "Flower, flower, all all and all" (p. 39), and he describes the simple renewal of life through the earth, "My second struggling from the grass" (p. 33). The wind, the seasons, and the weathers are the actions of the air. In creating the world God "set alight the weathers from a spark" (p. 27), and in the created world "A process in the weather of the heart / Turns damp to dry" (p. 6). Air, in the form of wind, weather, and seasons, is therefore an essential image of creating nature and a part of all creation, including that of Adam-Christ. Air is also associated with the earth to provide clusters of images signifying life. In Thomas a ball is a synecdoche for the world, hence for life- "The ball I threw while playing in the park / Has not yet reached the ground" (p. 72). A ball which is pricked loses its air; life too can be seen as a process wherein we eventually lose air. "Bubble" therefore becomes a metaphoric substitute for breath, "If the unpricked ball of my breath / Bump on a spout let the bubbles jump out" (p. 108). Life is created by nature out of "blood and bubble" (p. 40), and time is a thief who brings death by stealing bubbles, "the time-faced crook . .. with swag of bubbles" (p. 76). The wind as the primary movement of air is another constant metaphor for the breath of the world and of life itself. Whether "four-winded" or "twelve-winded," the created world is a world of winds, the "windy salvage" of God (Sonnet I). And in the human being "the windy blood / Slides like a sea" (p. 29) and becomes in death the "clotted wind" (p. 33). Most of the water imagery has to do with the sea, and, as might be expected, one of the major functions of the sea imagery is to express the idea of evolution. Man is "sea-born" (p. xvi), Adam is "sea-sucked" (p. 35), and woman has been "water-lammed" (p. 63). The begetters of mankind have risen "grimly from the wrack" (p. 54), that is, from seaweeds. From the sea comes all the force of life: "Out of the sea, the drive of oil" (p. 39), or again, "Life rose and spouted from the rolling seas" (p. 27). The sea is a "face of voices" (p. 43), and both the sea and a woman can be viewed similarly: "Where once the waters of your face / Spun to my screws." The sea is the "nurse of giants" (p. 65). Within man there is an ocean: "Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart /Push in their tides," and man's "windy blood / Slides like a sea" (p. 29). When the human seed fertilizes the egg it is imaged as a hero coming into harbor (p. 49). But the sea is not only the source of life; it is the termination of life in Thomas' imagery. This is why his thirty-fifth birthday poem closes with "I sail out to die" (p. 193). Life itself is a "grave- ward gulf" (p. 76), and man returns in death to the sea, which draws its water from all the corners of the world: "My grave is watered by the crossing Jordan. / The Arctic scut, and basin of the South" (p. 37). The sea is also a metaphor for the "voyage of life." The "invalid rivals / Voyaging clockwise off the symboled harbour" (p. 41) are the pedes-</page><page sequence="7">William T. Moynihan 637 trian minds and the philistines of the world. They live "clockwise," that is, in a humdrum circle, according to the clock. They see the water of death as annihilation, "Finding the water final"; they are "consumptives"-weak and diseased. They do not voyage bravely; instead they take their lingering "two farewells," but they "sail on the level," not on the two levels of the poet. This is their "departing adventure / To the sea- blown arrival." The moon and the tides of the sea are Thomas' images for the regularity, the order of life. In this sense the sea tumbles "in harness" to the moon (p. 112), and the moon is "the binding moon" (p. 74). The moon as the guardian of sleep, dream, romance, also marks the passage of time and by analogy the coming of death. The "conceiving moon" of In the White Giant's Thigh is, like Keats's Cynthia, a symbol of fertility. In keeping with universal occult and religious symbolism, Thomas' creation and renewal by fire is of a higher, or at least intenser, kind than that of earth, air, or water. Fire is seen as an aspect of God the creator, as well as of the world He created-"In the beginning was the mounting fire." The whole creating earth turns "On a wheel of fire" (p. 38) which is the sun. The sun is "the mystic sun, the wife of light" (p. 61), and the prime symbol of the created world's depend- ence on God-the "servant sun," "the rite of light" (p. 65). The sun is associated with the blood and the forces of life: "blood in their suns / Lights up the living worm" (p. 6), "The secret of the soil grows through the eye / And blood jumps in the sun" (p. 30). And the poet in the process of creating a poem can say, "Caught by the crabbing sun I walk on fire" (p. 19). The three types of creation, divine, natural, and poetic, all share one imagistic complex-that derived from spinning. Playing on the dual mean- ing of "spin," Thomas superimposes the idea of turning on the idea of making thread from raw fiber such as straw. Thus the globe is "of genesis spun" (p. 122), the world is a "spun bud" (p. 137), the earth in its turning makes a musical composition-"the whole world then ... / Spins its morning of praise" (p. 193), "the two-framed globe . .. spun into a score" (p. 26), and North, South, East, and West winds are a "four-winded spinning." The work of the creating season, spring, is likewise the work of spinning: "Be- ginning with doom in the bulb, the spring un- ravels, / Bright as her spinning-wheels, the colic season" (p. 40). The newly created world is called "the first, spinning place" (p. 179). The sun is the spinner of the conditions of life (pp. 157, 164), and the world of its making is "spun slime" (p. 193). And the poet, of course, is likewise a "spinning man" (p. xvi). Thomas' tailor and straw imagery are directly connected with his spinning concept. Since the tailor is one who makes things out of cloth and thread, he is a creator. Thomas describes God as "my maker, / The cloud perched tailors' master with nerves for cotton" (p. 148). The "tailors' master" does his sewing with nerves instead of cotton. Man's physical appearance is tailored- "pinned-around-the-spirit / Cut-to-measure flesh" (p. 147), and the poet beneath his preten- sions is "the boy of common thread." He charac- terizes his detractors, conventional mankind, as "the clock faced tailors," The flashing needle rock of squatters, The criers of Shabby and Shorten, The famous stitch droppers. (p. 148) Even the tides in their function as the source of life are called the "sewing tides" (p. 65). In view of the fact, however, that a tailor cuts as well as sews, and in view of the fact that the "cut-to-measure" flesh is doomed to death, the tailor image, like all images of creation, implies destruction as well as creation. The Latin root of "scissor" means "one who divides," or, specif- ically, a tailor. It is in this destructive role that Thomas sees the embryo "crouched like a tailor / Sewing a shroud for a journey" (p. 110). It is thus that the tailor can be "the green unraveller" (p. 12), green because he creates, an unraveller because his creation is doomed to death, and because he dresses man and nature for death: "His scissors oiled, his knife hung loose / To cut the channels at their source." This is also why "tailor age" "comes, like a scissors stalking" (p. 21). The tailor cluster of images explains most of the straw, string, bandage, hair, winding sheet images that occur in various places in Collected Poems. All of these things are creative when joined, bound, "spun," or sewn, and all are un- creative or symbols of death when they are not united. Unless some definite statement of their union is made, their appearance is a sign of mortality, serving a function similar to the more common "wax." When Thomas says "from the planted womb the man of straw" (p. 2), he means mortal man. He uses a similar image in "A rooking girl who stole me from her side / Broke through her straws, breaking my bandaged string" (p. 13). The breaking through straw is</page><page sequence="8">638 Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" the coming to the surface of sexuality, and the breaking of the bandaged string is the arousing of adolescent sexual desires. The notion of mortality and infertility is apparent in the imaging of the world as "the lying likeness of / Our strips of stuff that tatter as we move" (p. 17) and in the line "button your bodice on a hump of splinters" (p. 82). Imagistically associated with strips and straws and threads are the hair and coil images which make occasional appearances. The avenues of love which the fisherman of the Ballad had ex- plored when "his loin was a hunting flame" be- come the snare of the long-legged bait-"Coil from the thoroughfares of her hair" (p. 175). "Sussanah's drowned in the bearded stream" (p. 171) and Samson is "drowned in his hair" (p. 125). Even the forbidden fruit is seen as a "bearded apple" (p. 46). Just as the procreative urge ensnares man-"In the groin's endless coil a man is tangled" (p. 89), so also does the poetic urge ensnare the poet who In his slant, racking house And the hewn coils of his trade perceives Herons walk in their shroud. (p. 190) II It is not necessary to postulate a specific rela- tionship of Thomas to any doctrinal or theo- logical position regarding the Fall, or the Garden of Eden. As far as his poems go, he could just as well have used classical allusions to the Golden Age, or accounts of the fabled Hesperides, or Freud's first unweened state, in order to empha- size the imperfection of his world. But the fact of the symbolism remains that it was primarily derived from an imaginative re-creation of the Bible. The idea of Eden which is important to the symbolism is that related to "Edenic" states known to living man-childhood and rare mo- ments of tranquillity in nature, and even rarer moments of sexual bliss. Referring to childhood, before the "rumour of manseed / Within the hallowed gland," Thomas can say, "Green was the singing house" (p. 24). This is also the con- dition in the later Edenic descriptions of Fern Hill where the memory of childhood "was all / Shining, it was Adam and maiden" (p. 179). This joyful memory of Eden's green persists in spite of the fact that the poet now realizes he was "green and dying," now realizes the inevitability of the Fall, of suffering and death. Thomas' best picture of the unfallen state is another descrip- tion of childhood in Poem in October: And I saw in the turning so clearly a child's Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother Through the parables of sun light And the legends of the green chapels. (p. 114) Glimpses of the unfallen state may also be found in physical love: "in the cool of your mortal garden / With immortality at my side like Christ the sky" (p. 121). He says to his love, "In your every inch and glance is the globe of genesis spun, / And the living earth your sons." Love enables the lovers to recapture the pristine quality of the newly created world: And taken by light in her arms at long and dear last I may without fail Suffer the first vision that set fire to the stars. (p. 119) But the fallen world is omnipresent. It cannot be avoided. First there is the great Fall which is inherent in the nature of creation and exist- ence: "The hand that whirls the water in the pool / Stirs the quicksand" (p. 10). Time, the ruler of creation, is the most important symbol for the attrition of life-"I saw time murder me" (p. 79). The individual, and mankind whom he repre- sents, is enclosed even before birth in an Egyp- tian pyramid (p. 36).14 WVrapped like a "padded mummer" in the mask of a mummy (as also in "The mummy cloths expose an ancient breast," p. 72), which is also his "Egypt's armour," man "Weeps on the desert ochre and the salt / Incis- ing summer" while he tries to scrape through the embalming "resin" to reach the "starry bone" and the small spot of light which is like "a blood parhelion." Sonnet IX has to do with this same process of mummification-"the resurrec- tion in the desert." As might be expected, parchment and callig- raphy, pyramid, and (as they are in Genesis and Exodus) the Nile and Egypt, are images of time's oppressive captivity: "time, the quiet gentleman / Whose beard wags in Egyptian wind" (p. 72). Egypt is also the cradle of civiliza- tion and therefore an image of antiquity and by analogy the mummified world of propriety and 14 Senior says the pyramid "was a means of ascension. The word for 'pyramid' is derived from a set of hieroglyphics meaning 'place of ascension,' and the glyph for 'ascension' could represent a kind of pyramid. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the pyramid was an Egyptian ziggurat, a tower that stretched to heaven." This idea casts light on Thomas' other pyramid imagery ("my proud pyramid," p. 88), and also connects it to his tower and turret clusters.</page><page sequence="9">William T. Moynihan 639 convention. This is one reason why the "croco- dile" is described as "Tail, Nile, and snout" (p. 44); its body is human civilization, and mankind weeps for the lost Eden-"All-hollowed man wept for his white apparel" (p. 44). Thomas describes this further in Today, This Insect where he says, now that his symbols have "outelbowed" time and space, he will use the insect "and the world I breathe" as his images (p. 47). The severed halves of the insect are the subject of the particular poem, symbolic of his poetry in general, and, also, symbolic of the world which he sees about him. Thus he de- scribes the death of the insect in terms that are meaningful to both poetry and life, "I divided sense," and says that by killing the insect he has destroyed its Eden and "green genesis" just as time destroys man's. The central figure of this poem, as of the fallen world, has a "serpent caul" and is a "crocodile before the chrysalis." The "crocodile" is the worm, the caterpillar, which becomes a butterfly, the "flying heart- bone." But the lines also apply to the poet who is the monster that killed the insect, who like the serpent visited the garden, who like the butter- fly grew from the worm and the chrysalis ("Snail of man in His ship of fires," p. 78), and who be- fore he fell from innocence was a spirit of love. (As he tells us in "Should Lanterns Shine," p. 72, any "boy of love" would hesitate before "he fell from grace" if he knew the disenchantment which would follow sexual knowledge.) The last three lines of the stanza inform us that, like the ass's jawbone, this simple tale, "this children's piece," tells the truth, although unacknowledged; it brings the fate of the de- stroyed city upon the place of bliss-it "blows Jericho on Eden." All of this comes from ob- serving the insect, whose story is the "certain promise," the evidence of the whole cycle of existence, and of the inevitability of death. Life itself then is by its nature imperfect, "fallen." This is how Thomas can say of the new- born child, the "fallen saint," "Heaven fell with his fall and one crocked bell beat the left air" (p. 105). Again, he refers to "the infant forever unfree, / 0 my lost love bounced from a good home" (p. 109). However, there is another aspect of the Fall which is somewhat closer to the traditional inter- pretations of the story of Eden. This is the fall that comes with the knowledge of sex and the awareness of suffering. The all-important knowl- edge, for instance, that Adam and Eve gained from the apple is called in rabbinic commentaries tob wara, which means something like adult awareness. Adult life is comparable to the ex- pulsion from the Garden, comparable to the wandering in the desert. It is in this sense that Thomas sees women as lying "Like exodus a chapter from the garden" (p. 63) and that the images of sex and time come to be the spirits of evil in the poetry. The fallen world of adult life is made up of "time and the crabs and the sweethearting crib" (p. 14). Life is a "boiling circle"; it is "the sea and instrument nicked in the locks of time" (p. 44). And time is like a "running grave" (p. 21), it is ... a man outside with a billhook, Up to his head in his blood, Cutting the morning off. (p. 150) The whole world is seen as the helpless prey of the hunter, time, who has a tail like the beast of Revelation, "Stalking my children's faces with a tail of blood" (p. 58). Both the world of nature and the world of human beings moves inevitably toward death: Curlews aloud in the congered waves Work at their ways to death, And the rhymer in the long-tongued room, Who tolls his birthday bell, Toils towards the ambush of his wounds. (p. 190) The poet mourns the loss of innocence: "What's never known is safest in this life" (p. 59). Above all things, time for Thomas was a thief and the source of grief. "Grief thief of time" is the "time-faced crook, / Death flashing from his sleeve" (p. 76). And this "knave of pain" "steals off / The sea-halved faith that blew time to his knees"-time and grief steal our faith which is our only means of defeating time. Birth and death are "the two sad knaves of thieves," the offspring of time (p. 11). In Sonnet VII (p. 83) "time's tune" fixed "in a naked sponge" "sucks the bell-voiced Adam out of magic"-steals mankind's faith. And in In Country Sleep the "Thief" and his inevitable coming is associated with the fallen state of the whole world, "Ever and ever he finds a way.... / As the world falls, silent as the cyclone of silence" (p. 183). But "the country is holy." It is a kind of Eden in which all of nature worships God and the child in her innocence is still in a state of grace: "Be shielded by chant and flower and gay may you / Lie in grace" (p. 182). But time, the Thief, comes in this poem also "to take / Her faith" so that her death will leave her in a mean-</page><page sequence="10">640 Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" ingless world ("the lawless sun") grieving for the loss of time. The drive of time to create new life and to overcome death is the source of the "urchin grief" (p. 92). The "coral saint"-ever multiply- ing life, and the "salt grief"-the suffering of existence, make us forget the fact of death for a while, "And a whirlpool drives the prayerwheel" -our worship of God is conditioned by the "whirlpool" of our fallen existence. New life is the death knell of the living. It makes us recog- nize that the living are being replaced, "The oak is felled in the acorn / And the hawk in the egg kills the wren" (p. 173). It is because sex is seen as an aspect of this relentless drive of time to re- produce its creatures that the poet can speak of "The female, deadly, and male / Libidinous betrayal" (p. 127). The fallen world is a world of "wounds."'15 Man's mortality is his wound which cannot be healed. This is the "tide raking / Wound" (p. 185) which is "the turning of the earth in her holy / Heart." Without creation and mortality, time, the Thief, would be meaningless and power- less-would "fall on the dead like the willy nilly dew." The womb is a "bowl of wounds and weed" (p. 101) because it brings forth mortal creatures. But the joy of sex may at times make even mortality beautiful, so that "the wound / Is certain god" (p. 120). The wound as an image of the suffering of life and the inevitability of death appears in the Sonnets, Vision and Prayer, and Lie Still, Sleep Becalmed. The "gentleman of wounds" of Sonnet I is Christ, a figure for suffering humanity. This is why he can say, "The world's my wound, God's Mary in her grief, / Bent like three trees and bird-papped through her shift." God's world is the whole of creation, which is, by its mortal, fallen nature, a "wound." But the world of creation is also the mother of Christ, "God's Mary in her grief." The trees and birds of nature are her body and she is the spouse of the "long wound," God. In each of the five sonnets where "wound" appears it has a slightly different meaning, as is Thomas' custom. For example, in Sonnet VI, the "wound of manwax" has a much more specific connection with sex. The figure which dominates Thomas' fallen world is a voyaging or wandering figure. It is variously Samson, Christ, Ishmael, Cain-all figures of suffering humanity, "the stuff of all men, scapegoat, martyr, . .. , woe-bearer." The sea, as the primordial archetype of chaos, is the favorite place of wandering. Other places of wandering, common to numerous poets besides Thomas, Blake especially, are "the forest, the fallen garden . .. the labyrinth, the wilderness and the pathless blanket of winter snow."'6 In The Winter's Tale it is the trackless new fallen snow that symbolizes the wilderness in which the man is "torn and alone in a farm house in a fold / Of fields" (p. 131). In this fallen world no one can escape; whoever treads "these lab- yrinths," whoever is born into the "flat cities" is sure to fall "to His green myths" (p. 78). The poet prays "In the name of the wanton / Lost on the unchristened mountain" (p. 161) "that he [the Savior] let the dead lie though they moan." He prays this because "Forever falling night is a known / Star and country" (p. 163) to those who are accustomed to the "mazes" of the fallen world, the "quarters and graves / Of the endless fall." Although a child is to its parents their hope of immortality-"the serpent's / Night fall and the fruit like a sun" (p. 145), her dead body is the symbol of the death of innocence-"White as the skeleton / Of the garden of Eden," and her death an evidence of the fall, a return to chaos, "Bare as the nurseries / Of the garden of wilder- ness." The Altarwise sonnets are Thomas' most com- plete depiction of the fallen world, the world of exodus, or wilderness, the world of the lost wanderer, the outcast voyager. The sonnets are also the epitome of Thomas' obscurity. The whole sequence, and every word within it, is intended to be meaningful on so many different levels, that it may almost be said that the ambiguity itself is an image of the fallen world which it depicts. However, the speaker is, among other things, a "tale's sailor from a Christian voyage," a voyager and an outcast as well as a figure of Christ. The Sonnets have a loose chronological frame- work based on references to various periods in the process from birth to maturity.'7 Thus in the 15 Some idea of the antiquity and universality of the "wound" image may be gathered from Tertullian's reference to the wound of Christ which he calls a figure of the Church and also of mankind.

It is interesting to note that Tindall himself says, "I used to think Thomas more of a Freudian than he was. . . . But now I think Freud one of the lesser elements, useful for adding a dimension to the Bible" (pp. 9-10).</page><page sequence="11">William T. Moynihan 641 first sonnet Christ "scraped at my cradle," while in the second "The child that sucketh long is shooting up," and "Soon sets alight a long stick from the cradle." Sonnet III marks youth and the earliest stages of adolescence. It describes the loss of innocence in terms of the murder of Abel ("the lamb") by Cain ("Adam's wether" and the "black ram"). Sonnet IV marks the age of questions, the first awareness of death and passing time. Sonnet V signifies the discovery of the hypocrisy of conventional religion and the revolt against it. Like Jonah, then, the hero is cast into the sea and swallowed by the whale: "A climbing sea from Asia had me down / And Jonah's Moby snatched me by the hair." The initiation into life, which is also an initiation into death, through the experience of sex, occurs in Sonnet VI where the voyager blows tallow "from the wax's tower / The fats of midnight when the salt was singing." Then in Sonnet VII the voyager is aware of the nature of reality, "Adam" has been drained of "Time, milk, and magic, from the world beginning." And what is the re- sult of this view of life, the inevitable end of the voyager? "the crucifixion on the mountain, / Time's nerve in vinegar, the gallow grave." Sonnet IX then describes the mummification and burial of the crucified one. This is the end of the voyage, this is the meaning of man's "odys- sey," "With stones ... for ash and garland / And rivers of the dead around my neck." Life's penance and life's victory wreath is death. What meaning has this for the poet? Sonnet X answers this question: the "tale's sailor" will, like Atlas, "hold half-way off the dummy bay" balancing "Time's ship-racked gospel," the world, on the "globe" of his poetry. He will describe the "blown word" and "December's thorn screwed in a brow of holly"-the pain of life in the midst of its joy. And the "first Peter" can ask Christ, "the tall fish," who the "rhubarb man" is who has produced such a "flying garden" out of the "sea-ghost" of life. He hopes that his "garden" with its own "two bark towers" of personal Eden and Calvary will, by dying, find regenera- tion at the Day of Judgment. The regeneration is described in terms of the organic decay and reintegration of the body into the natural cycle, by means of the worm, the maggot of death. What makes the sonnets so opaque is that the relatively simple chronological progression is often obscured by the shifting point of view and the multiple identity of the narrator. The nar- rator is above all the Poet, who is archetypally associated with Christ, especially in Sonnet VIII. But the Poet is also the prototype of the human race, in which role he is "Adam, time's joker" who "on a witch of cardboard / Spelt out the seven seas, an evil index."''8 And the Poet is also one with all the outcasts and rebels of history and literature-Cain and Rip Van Winkle, Ishmael, Jonah, and Christ crucified. The Son- nets deal not only with the voyage of an indi- vidual, but also with the Man-Christ-Poet com- posite that appears throughout the poetry. The Ballad of the Long-legged Bait is the voyage of a man experiencing "the loss of Eden."'9 The hero is closely identified with Samson (the original title was Ballad of Samson- Jack), and the poem is a comprehensive treat- ment of the sex-time-death trap which for Thomas epitomized much of the human condi- tion. In loving we reproduce, and in reproduction we prepare for our own death-this is the di- lemma of the wanderer in the fallen world. (The same idea is basic to numerous poems from Thomas' middle period, for example, It Is the Sinner's Dust-tongued Bell, I Make this in a Warring Absence, Unluckily for a Death, Into Her Lying Down Head.) The Ballad takes the sea-voyage, life-journey analogy and adds a new dimension: fishing- voyage, reproduction. The sequence of events provides a symbolic description of courtship, marriage, pregnancy, progeny, and parenthood. It is a modern Freudian variation of the Samson story-a man daringly marries the woman he most desires and is brought by the deed into servile captivity; he becomes a sacrifice in "the furious ox-killing house of love." The raw animality, the brutish urge which Thomas so often associated with sex is conveyed by a host of violent sea life images. The sexual act is de- scribed as the woman bait fleeing "humpbacked tons" of whales, and innocence is lost: "Oh, Jericho was falling in their lungs!" Clear evi- dence that the fishing tale is an allegory of sexual experience appears in the seventeenth stanza, where the "whirled boat" is located "in the burn of his blood" (p. 169). After the wedding of sperm and egg-"Huge weddings in the 18 These lines may have a specific relationship to Thomas' own working methods. Vernon Watkins describes the manu- script of one of Thomas' stories, "The Orchards." "The whole story was written in minute handwriting on the inside cover of a cardboard box. He told me that it helped him to see the whole story in one place as he wrote it, and pages were less good for this than box-covers."

There is no victory over the twin evil of flesh and time. The fisherman has conquered "all the wanting flesh his enemy" and the "tempter under the eyelid," leaving "no more desire than a ghost." But in achieving that tranquillity he has sown his seed, he has thrown out "his line," he has cast forth his "gold gut." Now as he winds his reel he finds the monstrous progeny of time. "Out of the urn the size of a man" comes new life. The great god-devil Time possesses the fisherman through the instrument by which he sought to evade time-sex. The fisherman's "rod," like that of the dowser, leads him now to land, the fallen world. Though in some ways beautiful-"A garden holding to her hand / With birds and animals," it also includes "proph- ets loud on the burned dunes" and the ser- pent-insect-"insects and valleys," "Time and places," "seasons and clouds." The catch is the world of generation and destruction-"Rome and Sodom To-morrow and London," ruled by time and time's symbol, the steeple-"steeples pierce the cloud on her shoulder" (p. 175). There is nothing left of the Edenic orchards and the country of innocent childhood wishes-"nothing remains / Of the pacing, famous sea but its speech." The anchor which once "rode like a gull / Miles over the moonstruck boat" now "dives through the floors of a church" and the fisherman is "lost on the land." The sea in Lie Still, Sleep Becalmed (p. 153) is the "salt sheet," the bandage, which wraps the wound of God, as well as the place of voyage and the grave of the "drowned." Man's passage through this sea is also the exposure of his own wound to salt. Life is "my voyage . .. to the end of my wound." But the poet admonishes the sufferer, both God and mankind, to "lie still, sleep becalmed, hide the mouth in the throat" so that the rest of us will not be condemned or tempted to join the drowned, to give up the voyage. In Thomas' world, like the world of St. Paul, "all creation groaneth and travaileth in pain until now," and also like St. Paul, both mankind and creation wait for regeneration: "And not only it, but we ourselves also who have the first- fruits of the Spirit-we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption as sons, the redemption of our body" (Romans viii.22, 23). As we have seen, a large portion of Thomas' poetry is concerned only with the "sound flowing like blood from the loud wound" (p. 153), the groaning of mankind and creation. But Thomas' hope and vision of redemption becomes more and more evident as Collected Poems progresses. Almost in spite of himself he finds That the closer I move To death, one man through his sundered hulks, The louder the sun blooms And the tusked, ramshackling sea exults. (p. 193) TTT The plethora of rebirth imagery which marks the final quarter of Collected Poems is one of the most striking developments in Thomas' poetry. Nearly every one of the major poems written after 1941-the war poems, the poems to his children, the birthday poems, the incomplete Country Heaven trilogy-has perpetuity or re- generation as its central theme. There are nota- ble exceptions to this general movement: Fern Hill concludes that "time held me green and dying / Though I sang in my chains like the sea," which is more in keeping with the view of the earlier poetry, as is the "revolt" theme in Lament. But the dominant tone of the later poetry is restorative; it presents a view of life regenerated. The anguish of a creation whose end is decay, and of a fallen world characterized by a fatal marriage to sex and time and by the op- position of flesh and spirit, becomes reconciled in a gigantic body which creates and recreates deathlessly. Although the final poems are overwhelming in their symbolic promise of a regenerated world, they do not present a completely realized para- dise. We have nothing comparable to the Paradiso and Dante's vision of the redeemed enthroned as petals of the divine rose, nor do we even approximate Blake's "Night the Ninth" in The Four Zoas, where all the dead awake to the last judgment and men walk through flames and live. We have in Thomas, rather, a poet con- tinually striving to transmute out of the natural signs of perpetuity a vision of man's generic immortality. By the use of movements from dark to light, from winter to spring, by instances of sexual fulfilment and religious rituals, by such traditional symbols as the phoenix, and by pastoral and Edenic analogues, Thomas gives us glimpses of what that "other" state of existence might be like. But it is a condition which he as poet and we as readers must look upon from afar. Like Moses, we all stand atop Mt. Pisgah and</page><page sequence="13">William T. Moynihan 643 gaze toward a promised land. It is a land which owes much to literary tradition, to the Bible, to modern psychology, to animism, and to numer- ous other occult and theological positions whose presence is more a matter of tone than of de- monstrable certainty. Although the land is not clear in all its particulars, we know its outlines and, more important, we know that it is a symbolic world toward which the poetry has been building. At the outset Thomas saw birth as the begin- ning of death; toward the end he came to view birth as the beginning of a cycle which cul- minated in an entrance into "the sundering ulti- mate kingdom of genesis' thunder" (p. 146). By 1939 the more optimistic view was beginning to be manifest. Although he sees his son being bullied into the "rough seas" of existence by the "witch- like midwife second," he admonishes him (in an obvious counterpoint to Shakespeare's "Cry Havoc!") to "Cry joy" (p. 107). And in a com- panion poem, If My Head Hurt..., the woman marks the birth of her son by saying "the endless beginning of prodigies suffers open" (p. 109). This shift of attitude toward birth, and con- sequently toward life and death as well, is the substance of Vision and Prayer. It reveals the tension of the "common lazarus" (cf. John xi) who "prays / Never to awake and arise" (p. 163) but who nevertheless is "found" (p. 165) and comes "To dumbfounding haven" where the "high noon" of God "Blinds my / Cry" (p. 157). The movement from dark to light-the poem begins with the dark running "over the ghost" and ends with lightning and sun-is underlined by a subtle adaptation of baptism imagery. The poet, contemplating the birth of his child, says in the first stanza that there will be "no baptism," only darkness for a "blessing." At the poem's end, however, the rite of in- corporation into the elan vital has been accom- plished. It is not effected by the pouring of or- dinary water, but by the fiery liquids from the heart of the theocentric universe, the "loud sun" which "Christens down / The sky." The speaker is "found" and longs to be "scalded" and "drowned" "in his world's wound." Although this is an expression of Thomas' affirmation, of his belief in the worth and value of human life, it is an agonizing expression. What he announces here is the movement from the horrible confusion of the purposeless world to the equally horrible reality of the purposeful world, what Blake speaks of as "the terrors of Creation and Redemption and Judgment." His prayer for "the wanton / Lost on the un- christened mountain" was that they not know the suffering and terror of rebirth, that they be allowed to remain "In the interpreted evening / And the known dark of the earth" (p. 164). The whole poem turns on the analogy between the birth of a child out of the safety and darkness of the womb into the terror of the birth process and the blinding sun of life, and the rebirth or re- demption of man out of the "known dark" into the "dazzling prison" and lightning of the "blinding / One." Despite the magnificence of the goal, the process is painful and terrifying. But the wonder of creation startles him into love of life and desire for redemption, "His lightning answers my / Cry," and "the sun roars at the prayer's end." Love is the transmuting element which turns the fallen world into the redeemed world. Thomas says this in nearly all of his later poems, but each time he uses a slightly varied combina- tion of symbolic equations. A Winter's Tale, for example, employs winter-spring, sexual fulfill- ment, the phoenix, and the cup and bread as prime metaphors for saying that a man may achieve a state of bliss, Nirvana, release from the "crest of grief" (p. 132), fulfillment for his hunger and need. A Winter's Tale is the tale of rebirth which nature tells even in the dead of winter, and it is likewise the tale told about "the believer lost and the hurled outcast of light" (p. 133). The "winter's tale" is told by the "snow blind twilight" and by the voices of the remembered spring-the nightingale, the "voice of the dust of water," "the wizened / Stream," "the gristed leaves," and even the "carved mouths in the rock." It is "a hand or sound" in the telling that opens the "dark door" of perception (p. 134) where appears the mystic bride, the "she bird," who combines the symbolic red and white of ful- fillment, perfection, the ideal state, "her breast with snow and scarlet downed" (p. 134).2? With her appearance all that had been seen as dead comes alive: "The dancers move / On the de- parted, snow bushed green," the "centaur dead, turn and tread the drenched white / Paddocks." (Thomas also says Heaven is a place "where souls grow wild / As horses in the foam," p. 192.) The bird has come to the "hurled outcast of light" to make life meaningful. Now everything 20 Evelyn Underhill, Mysticism (Meridian, N.Y., 1955), p. 146.</page><page sequence="14">644 Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" is done for love: "The dead oak walks for love," "For love, the long ago she bird rises." All the fallen world rejoices in man's pursuit of the ideal, for in the prayer and the bird who came in an- swer to the prayer nature sees its redemption: "all the elements of the slow fall rejoiced / That a man knelt alone in the cup of the vales" (p. 135). As is customary in fairy tales and legends of wish fulfillment, the man follows the bird,2' "All night lost and long wading in the wake of the she- / Bird." The numerous ideals the bird represents include sexual fulfillment, but also an allegorical "joy beyond / The fields of seed and the time dying flesh astride." Nature is transcended; "The heavens" become "the heav- en," the "grave" becomes "the burning font" of regeneration (p. 136). In death the man and the bird are united. The "door of his death" opens to a second and completed vision in which the man who had "knelt alone in the cup of the vales" is now "on a bread white hill over the cupped farm." The earth, the world of nature, is seen as the sacramental cup and bread, the ritual foundation of his vision. This is why the whole tale takes place "Once when the world turned old / On a star of faith pure as the drift- ing bread" (p. 131), and after the tale ends "the rite is shorn" (p. 136). In the final four stanzas everything that had come alive with the bird disappears back into death and winter, still waiting for the resur- rection, the "trumpeting dawn." But the man does not return to the winter of his hunger and need; he is reborn. Joined with the bird in the nuptials of death, brought to the bridal chamber of the grave, the man finds the mystic "whirl- / Pool at the wanting centre." This "woman breasted and .. . heaven headed / Bird" is now clearly a figure of androgynous divinity. In Genesis the Hebrew word for Almighty God, "El Shaddai," means "woman-breasted." "Heaven headed" speaks for itself. The man who had knelt and wept and prayed has now been "brought low," and from this death he rises in the spring of resurrection: "And she rose with him flowering in her melting snow." Thomas regarded three of his last poems-In Country Sleep, Over Sir John's Hill, and In the White Giant's Thigh-as parts of a single poem- in-progress.22 Considered in this way, these works reveal the god-universe and the man- divinity merged, yet, paradoxically, still carry- ing on their respective man or God functions. In order to see more clearly this penultimate de- velopment of Thomas' regeneration myth we must look at the unity of the poems through Thomas' own eyes. In 1950, during a BBC reading, Thomas de- scribed the plan into which the three poems would fit as "grand and simple." The "grand" part is his optimistic and regenerative view of human existence. The "simple" part is Thomas' description, which does, however, provide val- uable insights into what he was striving to achieve. The proposed long poem-which Thomas called In Country Heaven is to open with the "godhead . . . black-baller. . . woe- bearer" weeping as one of His worlds (the earth) murders itself. "And Country Heaven is sud- denly dark. Bushes and owls blow out like candles." The human inhabitants of heaven wonder which of the worlds has destroyed itself, and, when they learn it is their former home, they begin to exchange stories. "And, one by one, these heavenly hedgerow-men, who once were of the Earth, call one another, through the long night, Light and His tears falling, what they remember, . . . what they know in their Edenie [sic] hearts, of that self-called place. They re- member places, fears, loves, exultation, misery, animal joy, ignorance and mysteries, all we know and do not know."23 Thomas would have us regard In Country Sleep, Over Sir John's Hill, and In the White Giant's Thigh as remembered tellings by in- habitants of country heaven. (Thomas is not using "remembered" in the conventional sense. Instead "the rememberer may live himself back into active participation in the remembered scene, adventure, or spiritual condition.")24 Thomas' explanation puts all the poems sub specie aeternitatis and, consequently, allows us to connect the Thief and child, the sparrow and hawk, the women and the hill. For all finally become meaningful under a divinity who is both within nature and outside of nature. Thomas also said that "some of the long poem is written down on paper, some of it is in a 21 Soren Kierkegaard, in Fear and Trembling and The Sickness unto Death, trans. Walter Lowrie (New York: Anchor, 1954), p. 170, refers to this in his discussion of possi- bility: "Fairy tales and legends so often relate that a knight suddenly perceived a rare bird, which he continues to run after, since at the beginning it seemed as if it were so very near-but then it flies off again, until at last night falls, and he has become separated from his companions." 22 Quite Early One Morning, pp. 178-179. 23 Ibid., p. 179. 24 Ibid., p. 180.</page><page sequence="15">William T. Moynihan 645 rough draft in the head, and the rest of it radiantly unworded in ambitious conjecture."25 Fortunately, at least one copy of In Country Heaven has survived, and that manuscript forms an interesting complement to Thomas' remarks on the grand design.26 This poetic fragment equates God, the human heart, and nature, and even more particularly the hill, yet at the same time retains the perception of God as an in- dividual spirit. The poem shows maker and first cause of Creation subsumed under a God of love and of pity who cosmically prays and weeps for man. God Crosses the breast of the praising East, and kneels, Humble in all his planets, And weeps on the abasing hill. The symbol of heaven is nature; heaven is "the canonized valley" where "angels whirr like pheasants." Heaven is a place of "seraphic fields," with "God's bright, flocks, the belled lambs leaping, / (His gentle kind)," and the hawk is a shooting star who is "locked blind in a lame cloud." "Heaven's cities" are also sacred, they are "the twelve apostles' towns," and though the marauding fox still prowls there, the "farms of Heaven's keeping, / . . . sleep sound." They sleep sound because the final element of existence is pity: For the fifth element is pity, (Pity for death); No fowl or field mouse that night of his kneeling Lies in the fox's fires Or twice dies in the screechowl's eyes. This glimpse of paradise that Thomas fash- ioned sometime between 1946 and 1949 was ap- parently put aside in order to view eternity through human eyes, rather than the world through God's eyes. In Country Heaven describes eternity as the world without death-but Thomas did not find it so easy to banish death from the world. It is this problem that the three "remembrances" try to resolve. In Country Sleep is directed to a sleeping child, and, at first glance, it appears repetitious and contradictory. The repetition is certainly part of the poet's effort to enchant the reader, to spell- bind by a Whitmanesque piling up of descrip- tions. The contradictions lie in the poem's open- ing by admonishing the child not to "fear or believe" that the wolf shall devour her, and con- cluding with the warning that she must always "believe and fear" that the Thief "comes to leave her in the lawless sun awaking/ Naked and for- saken to grieve he will not come." The resolution of this apparent contradiction and of the meaning of the poem lies in the identification of the half dozen major images in the poem. The "country sleep" which the child experiences is a symbol of death. And the final confusing lines turn on a distinction to which we have previously alluded. The child should fear that the Thief will leave her in a "lawless sun." If, however, she retains her "country faith," she need not fear, for she will find that faith "as deathless as the outcry of the ruled sun." The religious imagery associated with nature and the country becomes a kind of catechism of the faith the poet would confer on the child. Nature is heaven because, as in In Country Heaven, all the attributes of nature sans death become a description of eternity. We still have death (symbolized by the Thief), but we should know by the sacramentality of nature that death will be transcended. "The nightbird lauds through nunneries and domes of leaves / Her robin breasted tree, three Marys in the rays" (p. 182). The "holy of holies," the "Sanctum sanctorum," is "the animal eye of the wood / In the rain tell- ing its beads." There is a "beat of blood through the laced leaves," and a "surpliced / Hill of cypresses." The whole of nature is a miraculous prayer. It is a "saga from mermen / To sera- phim," it is "Music of elements, that a miracle makes!" The Thief is time, and consequently death. In calling time a Thief, Thomas is drawing upon the New Testament descriptions of Christ: "The Lord will come as a thief in the night" (II Peter iii.10), and especially "Behold, I come as a thief! Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame" (Revelation xvi.15). The garments which Revelation would have the believer keep are the garments of faith. The Thief of the Apocalypse does not, however, come to steal the faith of the believer in "the saga of prayer" as Thomas' Thief does. If the adult believed, says Thomas, as fervently as the child in the holy magic of nature, he would finally want the Thief to come; he would want to "wake from country sleep" to find that deathless faith of which miraculous nature is but a figure. The primary law of animal existence is cannibalism.

If "the country is holy," if all the elements of nature are miraculous and eternal, some judg- ment is necessary concerning this fundamental cannibalism. This judgment is given in Over Sir John's Hill. The hawk symbolizes devouring na- ture; he is the executioner who "pulls to his claws / And gallows, up the rays of his eyes the small birds of the bay." The hawk, like all nature, calls "Come and be killed." And the poet, like St. John, who heard a "voice from heaven like a voice of many waters" (Revelation xiv.2), opens "the leaves of the water at a passage / Of psalms" and finds the meaning of his fable about the sparrows' death. First of all, death is not blamed on the slayer: "all praise of the hawk on fire in hawk-eyed dusk be sung." The emphasis falls rather on the in- nocent victims "who cluck, 'dilly dilly, / Come let us die'." But in their slaughter they become "blest," although they, "the led-astray birds," are also judged guilty by the forces of nature, "the heron and I, under judging Sir John's elmed / Hill." The judgment of Sir John's Hill is Thomas' judgment of the world, of the beauty and value and purpose of life. The poem an- nounces praise for the hawk, guilt for the spar- rows. The hawk is praised because he continues the life process, but the sparrows too are of in- finite worth. Thus the poet (and the heron- because the heron is sacerdotal and a symbol of the holiness of nature) asks mercy for the souls of the slain birds. The appeal for mercy echoes Matthew x.28-29 (a passage which also shows the thematic relationship of this poem to In Country Sleep): "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father." This is the basis for the poet's prayer that God "have mercy on" the birds, "God in his whirlwind silence save, who marks the sparrows hail, / For their souls' song." The implication is, clearly, that there will be mercy. For the poet says he has engraved these words "for the sake of the souls of the slain birds sailing." If the souls are "sailing," then there is some regeneration. In the White Giant's Thigh reverses the com- mon platitude about human beings continuing to live through their children. Thomas takes here as his subject those women who have never conceived and finds that in spite of the fact that they produced no new life while living, they do in death. Although this is the most pantheistic of Thomas' rebirth poems, it cannot be regarded as simply pantheistic. For from these "dead and deathless women" he not only draws the knowl- edge of mankind's participation in the ever- creating earth, but he also learns of a "love that is evergreen" which survives the grave. The much-discussed question of the white giant as a legend or as a "real" geographical landmark seems irrelevant. Thomas thought that there was such a place and he embellished it for his own purposes, forming the hillside landmark into a living creature, a symbol of the fertile earth, in whom and by whom the dead women were now deathless.27 The women in death, as in life, are part of the elemental creative urge in all nature. The poet, too, responds to this urge, "Now cur- lew cry me down to kiss the mouths of their dust." And the whole poem is "remembered" by the "heavenly hedgerow men" who can see the rebirth which has taken place, "And the daugh- ters of darkness flame like Fawkes fires still." In spelling out Thomas' Biblical rhythm we have encountered Jehovah, Satan, Adam, Abra- ham, Cain, Jacob, Samson, Christ. We now come to Noah. The Adam-Christ-Poet composite is constant, but in each phase of the poetry it takes on slightly different overtones. The three modifying figures are Jehovah, Samson, and Noah. The jealous God, the first Cause, is the figure under which the early poetry labors-in awe, in mockery, in creation. Samson, although explicit in only two poems, is nevertheless the representative figure of the fallen world. Finally, Noah, the savior of mankind and nature, epit- omizes the poetry of regeneration. In the Prologue Thomas invokes the primitive archetype of the flood to symbolize metamor- phosis from the natural cycle to a new and higher kind of life. That the sea in this poem is not primarily a Freudian sea and that Thomas is not simply imaging a return to the womb is sug- gested by the ark figure. Thomas the man and the poet is the "Noah's ark" which sails into the primordial flood. The identification of man and ark becomes even clearer towards the end: 27 One critic has suggested that the "white giant" is the locale of some Welsh legend and marks the spot from which a group of young women leaped to their deaths rather than be taken away from their husbands (Marlene Chambers, "Thomas' IN THE WHITE GIANT'S THIGH," Expl., xix, March 1961, 39). However, Thomas himself said that he had "never seen the White Giant and had no idea of its location, if any," but he understood that "barren girls" came to the Giant as a place of fertility and that there boys were waiting to oblige-without success (Reader's Guide, p. 293).</page><page sequence="17">William T. Moynihan 647 We will ride out alone, and then, Under the stars of Wales, Cry, Multitudes of arks. The poem opens with day "winding down," a third of the way along, "the salmon, sucked sun slips," shortly thereafter the moon appears, and, finally, the stars. The stars are identified with the souls of men, the "multitudes of arks" which are sailing with him in the night. (He times the birth of his daughter, "since the falling star you were born," p. 183, and elsewhere describes the stars as "mansouled fiery islands," p. 193.) Thomas sees himself as Noah saving the world, and he also sees every man as a Noah's ark "manned" with his own "loves," sailing "across / The water lidded lands." This is the summation of Thomas' vision of re- generation, the thematic and symbolic climax of the Biblical rhythm that unites his poetry. It is epitomized in Prologue's ending where the faith he found for his daughter, the mercy he found for the sparrows, and the perpetuity he found for the barren women becomes a symbolic regeneration for himself: My ark sings in the sun At God speeded summer's end And the flood flowers now.
