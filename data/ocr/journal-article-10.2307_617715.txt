<plain_text><page sequence="1">doctrinaire structuralist bias which is evident in this volume, as in its predecessor. It is not satisfactory simply to characterize Judaism as an anti-iconic religion and construct reasons for this, when practice has so constantly belied such a theory. (Even in the Bible which forbids anthropomorphism or theriomorphism, the prohibition evidently never affected verbal images.) These opening paragraphs show an imperfect understanding of the basic 'sacra- mental' world view not only of Christianity but also, in a way, of its cultural sister, Judaism. But the rest of the introduction is more helpful, and brings out, on Levi- Straussian lines, such common patterns of theme and interpretation as the volume presents. Unfortunately, the opening essay, ' Das Bild des Unsichtbaren. Zu den friihen Christus- bildern ', by M. Barasch, is the least satisfac- tory item in the volume, and it may also have influenced the introduction in the respect just criticized. A disappointing text is matched by poor use of illustrations (including a simple mistake regarding a famous mosaic) and an antiquated bibliography, which fails to reflect how this subject has been revolutionized in the past 30 years. In the other essay on Christian themes, I. P. and C. Culianu study the Ascent of Elijah and the Dormition of Mary in Rumanian folk icons and interestingly suggest that pre- Christian religion has left traces. Certainly, such influences are not infrequent in popular Orthodox and Catholic religion; but the philo- logical arguments need a more up-to-date treatment. As for the legend of the Jew whose hands were cut off and restored, whatever the reasons why this came to be a favourite detail in Balkan icons, it ought to be said clearly that it is explicit in the Greek literary tradition from John of Thessalonica in the early sixth century. The only article on a Jewish theme, by J. Gutmann, on the Judaeo-German custom of embroidering and treasuring cloths used at circumcision, is interesting, but strange as a contribution to a volume on representations of gods. Two articles deal with ancient Near Eastern religion: H. Sauren discusses the dress of gods in Mesopotamian literary and visual docu- ments, identifying the symbolic regalia related especially to planetary deities, while W. Neumer-Pfau discusses the warrior-goddesses who take part in the Gigantomachy on the great frieze of the Pergamon Altar, relating them to the Anatolian cult of the Great Mother. The articles mentioned with special prai , at the beginning are also those which range farthest beyond the Near Eastern and Euro- pean fields. R. M. Berndt is the leading authority on Australian Aboriginal religion, and his article gives a most informative intro- duction to its subject. A. M. Hocquenghem, likewise an authority on the Mochicas of Peru, examines two important iconographic features, the fangs bared by supernatural beings and the serpents, usually attached to their girdles: these symbolize respectively the absolute authority and the immortality of the ancestors, forced labourers; and he left Madagascar under something of a cloud. There is insufficient space to do more than hint at the wide range of new information and valuable insights provided by Stephen Ellis in this study. His style is, unusually for an aca- demic treatise, clear and readable, aspiring at times to elegance. The book has been well pro- duced, with an excellent bibliography and no detectable misprints other than some for- givable misspellings of long and difficult Malagasy names; though some photographs and a few more maps would have been wel- come. Criticisms of the text are few and minor and relate mainly to the introductory chapter where there are occasional doubtful interpreta- tions and areas of vagueness in the treatment of the early history of the Merina people. The only important regret is that the book is directed at specialists on Madagascar, and a detailed knowledge of the historical, geo- graphical, and ethnic background is assumed. In the absence of a more comprehensive intro- ductory chapter and a wider use of explanatory footnotes, the non-expert will have to struggle with an unfamiliar political, social, and cul- tural background made more forbidding by the discouragingly long names of people and places. This is a pity as the book deserves a wide audience and can be read with much profit by students of general colonial history and Third World nationalism. In his introduc- tion, the author expresses the hope that in telling the story of the menalamba he will con- tribute to a wider understanding of Malagasy history. He has amply succeeded in this aim. MERVYN BROWN H. G. KIPPENBERG and others (ed.): Representations of gods. (Visible religion: annual for religious icono- graphy. Vol. II.) x, 173 pp. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1983. Guilders 75. The plan of this Annual was briefly described in the review of Vol. I (BSOAS, XLVII, 3, 1984, 608). The papers in Vol. II are again related to a broad theme, but again loosely and with no claim to cover its main aspects. The eight studies gathered here are, however, mainly of a high standard and are well supported by 98 illustrations occupying 60 pages. Three of the contributions, which account for more than half of the volume between them, are abso- lutely authoritative, by masters of their sub- jects: R. M. Berndt on 'Images of God in Aboriginal Australia ', A. M. Hocquenghem on characteristic features of divine beings among the Mochicas of Peru, and H. von Stietencron on the development of myth and iconography in relation to Durga Mahisasuramardini. Since there is not a little to criticize in this volume, let this high praise stand first: it will be expanded below. The introduction, by L. P. van den Bosch, aims to sketch the theme of ' Representations of gods' and indicate how the various essays relate to it. He starts with assertions about attitudes to iconography in Judaism, Chris- tianity and Islam which the reviewer finds highly questionable-partly because of the 243 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">whose authority is vested in the shamans of the Mochicas and other Andean peoples. The longest, most closely argued and most fully illustrated contribution to the volume is that by H. von Stietencron, ' Die Gottin Durga Mahisasuramardini. Mythos, Darstellung und geschichtliche Rolle bei der Hinduisierung Indiens '. He leads the reader with admirable clarity and most convincingly through the labyrinth of variant and developing myths and visual representations concerning the vic- torious battle of the supreme Goddess over the champion of their enemies, the Asuras, who first took the form of a bull. The proposed develop- mental history and analysis is most illumi- natingly related to the Brahmin adoption and exploitation of a powerful myth which they found to hand in popular culture. The reviewer is not in a position to criticize this analysis, but would balance some previous sceptical remarks about doctrinaire structuralism by saying that this article seems to present structuralist anthropology at its best. ROBERT MURRAY A. M. KHAZANOV: Nomads and the outside world. Translated by Julia Crookenden. (Cambridge Studies in Social Anthropology, 44.) xxviii, 366 pp. Cambridge, etc.: Cambridge University Press, 1984, Â£37.50, $65. We do not take kindly to those who trans- gress what we have defined as the 'normal' parameters of space and time. When they live in communities like gypsies, bohemians or hippies and, without actually breaking the law, refuse to inhabit 'normal' dwellings, to per- form ' normal ' activities at ' normal ' hours, and perhaps worst of all to ' settle down ', they threaten our civilized way of life with its clearly measured and organized spatial and temporal order. Like it or not, these commu- nities belong to our society; but familiarity breeds contempt and dislike of them as ' back- ward ', ' disorderly ' and ' dirty ', despite recent studies showing that, for example, gypsies regard us, the Gorgios, as dirty for not observing what to them are categorical rules of cleanliness. Our attitude to such deviant ' Others' is, however, ambivalent and inevitably coloured by counter-images, the myths of the outlaw and the nomad. Outlaws, as heroes for today, are individuals not groups: Robin Hood's direct heirs are the fantasy loners James Bond, Superman, Luke Skywalker; his band of out- laws resurfaces, at a convenient distance, in the American West of the cowboy and the Magni- ficent Seven. Nomads are even more remote: there were none in Merrie England, and even when we had an Empire, the tribes that harried our frontiers were not nomads, while the nomads we knew were often secret allies creat- ing trouble for foreign governments of which we did not really approve. For Western Euro- peans now, the term ' nomad ' conjures up only positive and romantic images: desert hospita- lity, arcadian shepherds, Biblical patriarchs. Only remotely do we now recall the medieval devastations of the Mongol hordes. Nomads and outlaws are for us a different sort of ' Other'; they are not our problem, not part of our time and space. Remote and un- threatening, we attribute to their way of life enviable qualities of freedom, nobility, purity and simplicity. For the Russians it has been very different. As Gellner points out in his essential Foreword to this important book, ' Russian history and consciousness ... is pervaded by an awareness of the nomad problem.' The Russian image of nomads is one of predators and parasites; from their conquest of the first Russian state to their final conquest, within living memory, by the Soviets, nomads have left their mark on the Russian soul. It is fitting that the first major theoretical and comparative study of nomads should have been done by a Russian anthropo- logist-but it is perhaps only possible for it to be of general interest (as it is) because the author is also clearly a dissident, or at least unorthodox in his field. K. Marx does not appear in the massive bibliography; in the text he figures only to be indirectly criticized through the work of some ardent and (Khaza- nov says) misdirected Western disciples. None the less, Khazanov's approach to nomadism is essentially historical-materialist. He takes a strictly economic definition of nomads as ' mobile, extensive pastoralists'. Where non-Marxists have sought to study separately the implications of nomadism as pastoralism and nomadism as movement, Khazanov is interested only in the former, noting that 'all forms of pastoralism may be regarded as different methods of economic adaptation, the parameters of which are deter- mined, in the final analysis, by ecology and the level of technological development' (p. 69). Assembling an enormous range of historical and ethnographic materials by Russian and Western scholars, he establishes a typology of nomadic societies, classified according to mainly geographical criteria, and he carefully examines the evidence for the origins of nomadism in each region-the steppes and highlands of Eurasia, the Middle East, the Near East (including North Africa) and East Africa. Nomadic economies he finds to be unstable and dependant on non-pastoral sources of food and goods. The major features of nomadic social organization, in particular the development of social inequality, reflect the nature of relations with the outside. He examines the various forms those relations take (settlement, trade, tribute, raiding, sub- mission, subjugation), the emergence of states among nomads, and the history of nomad rela- tions with settled states in each region. Throughout he is commendably cautious in dealing with the evidence, and concerned to debunk prevailing myths about nomads, for example that the patriarchs of Israel were nomads (they were actually much involved in agriculture), that nomadism developed out of a hunting way of life (in almost all cases it was a late development out of settled farming), that nomads are not interested in conserving pastures (there are counter-examples from each region). Khazanov's theory of nomadism lies in his most general conclusions: that nomadic socie- 244 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
