<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Staging as an Anthropological Category" Eric Gans The scene of human culture is not found in nature; it is staged. Each of the utterance forms of language is a staging, whether it be the ostensive that stages an element of the real world ("Fire!"), the imperative that forces the world to realize the staging implicit in the linguistic sign, or the declarative that allows us to construct in our imagination a fictive staging of this world. It is this latter category that most concerns Wolfgang Iser, but the imaginary construc tion of the fictive is conceivable only on the basis of the more elementary forms that link the world of signs with the world of originary experience. "Staging as an Anthropological Category" is the title of the last section of Iser's major work of literary anthropology, The Fictive and the Imagi nary.1 In the epilogue, Iser puts aside his categories of fictive and imaginary, first for those of "mimesis" and "performance," and finally for that of "staging." All these last are "anthropological" categories in the sense that they explicitly abandon the dual subject-object relation of metaphysics for a scenic configuration in which the sign mediates among the members of a collective audience. A staged performance, the classical locus of mimesis as it has been understood since Aristotle, takes place before the representatives of the community, who observe the generation of a transcendent world of meanings out of human interac tion. To refer to the fictions that we enjoy in the privacy of our imagination as "staged" is to remind us of the communal source of these as of all representations. I would contend that the transcendence of reality through representa tion implicit in the categories of mimesis, performance, and staging, a transcendence that is for Iser the raison d'?tre of the human as a literary being, can most parsimoniously be explained by means of a generative hypothesis of origin. The impossibility of attaining the "real" otherwise than through representation?an impossibility that defines humanity from the beginning?is at the same time the basis of the imagination's capacity to liberate itself from the culturally given to explore the implicit potential of new, hypothetical "realities." Generative thinking observes this process of liberation from the minimally disruptive standpoint of its hypothetical scene of origin. New Literary History, 2000, 31: 45-56</page><page sequence="2">46 NEW LITERARY HISTORY One way of characterizing the difference between human language and even the most sophisticated animal communication systems is that language allows us to combine or "stage" ideas in our minds indepen dently of the real-world situation in which we find ourselves. But this mental process in itself does not suffice to justify the metaphor of "staging." How then does our capacity to combine ideas in our minds lead us to the idea of the stage, with its reference to the public scene of dramatic and, before that, of ritual performance? The answer is that it does not. If the human gift of language were adequately understood, as the majority of social scientists would have us believe, as our individual mental capacity for generating "symbolic" signs that permit us to formulate ideas independently of direct stimuli, then there would be no plausible explanation of how phenomena like ritual and, subsequently, literary staging could ever have come into being. Hence it is not surprising that, with all the recent advances in cognitive psychology, neurology, primatology, and paleoanthropology, no plausible explanation has yet been provided for the co-origin of ritual staging with language.2 Although paleontologists often cite evi dence of ritual practices (cave art, burials, statuettes) as the sole proof that those who engaged in them possessed human language, they inevitably attribute the selective value of language itself to its use in seeking food, avoiding predators, maintaining and developing tool kits, or, at best, creating solidarity within the group.3 The originary interde pendence between language and the ritual that stages it has not yet been assimilated within positive scientific discourse. In contrast, Iser's human istic conception of literature offers insight not only into this interdepen dence but into its inaccessibility to positive scientific method. The model of communication provided by our staging of fictional language sheds light on our use of language in general. If we make the "postmetaphysical" assumption that staging does not emerge as a specific form of our general linguistic capacity but that it is rather this capacity that emerges from staging, then the key challenge posed to literary anthropology by Iser's metaphor is to construct the relation between fiction as mental staging and the stage as the locus of cultural performance. We can use the linguistic sign as a means of internal representation only subsequently to its invention/discovery as a collective mode of communication?one whose radical discontinuity from prehuman signal systems is increasingly recognized. What then does it mean for the linguistic sign to be staged? The stage is a sacred space inaccessible to us; what takes place on it stands in a "vertical" representational relationship to lived reality that contrasts with our "horizontal" appetitive relations with objects on the plane of worldly interaction. It is by attending to what we cannot react to in the mode of</page><page sequence="3">STAGING AS AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CATEGORY 47 mere animal appropriation and assimilation that we generate?and, in Darwinian terms, that we inaugurate the process of selecting for?the free space of contemplation that can subsequently become internalized in our brains and give rise to the process of internal staging we call "thinking." The sacred stage that we share with the other members of the community is the source of the mental space in which we conceive our ideas. For Iser, the key operation by which we continue to expand this mental space is called "fictionalization." I hope to contribute to an ongoing dialogue with Professor Iser by translating his formulation of the relationship between the fictive and the imaginary into the language of generative anthropology.4 I begin with a seminal sentence from the first chapter of The Fictive and the Imaginary: [T]he fictionalizing act converts the reality reproduced into a sign, simulta neously casting the imaginary as a form that allows us to conceive what it is toward which the sign points. (FT 2) Fiction has traditionally been opposed to reality on the analogy of the opposition between truth and lie. In contrast, Iser insists on the dependency of the fictional world on the elements it borrows from the real world. When we say that a novelist's Paris or London is not the "real" Paris or London, we have already accepted the latter as an objective basis of comparison. But the "reality reproduced" in the work of fiction does not serve the same purpose as it does in so-called nonfictional discourse: it becomes a "sign" that, to use Iser's term (FI3), "lure[s]" our imag ination away from its undisciplined reveries and obliges it to focus on the referent of this sign, "what it is toward which the sign points." This process of seduction repeats the originary passage from unreflective appetite to desire mediated by the sign. How are we to translate this formulation into the terms of originary aesthetics? As Iser well understands, the aesthetic relation is not "natu ral" but exclusively human, that is, mediated by signs. The fictionalizing act that generates the literary sign sets our imagination the task of constructing an imaginary world on the basis of this sign, an operation that requires the constant return from the world to its source in the sign. This oscillatory movement is more apparent in the contemplation of a static art-object like a painting, where the spectator's imaginary con struction is constantly renewed by new glances at the artwork, than in our experience of the temporally unfolding literary text; the reader is not aware of "returning" from his imagination to the text because he never leaves it. It is nonetheless useful to make explicit this characteristic movement of aesthetic creation/reception, if only because it reminds us</page><page sequence="4">48 NEW LITERARY HISTORY that sign and imagination constantly interact. Even the most richly iconic representation of plastic art, let alone the "arbitrary" signs of language, depends on the imagination to fill it with content as much as the imagination depends on the "form" supplied by the sign. The aesthetic sign gives access to a reservoir of remembered content that is no sooner exteriorized in an imaginary form than the latter becomes inadequate to the sign's potential and must be torn down and recon structed anew. In Iser's formulation, the "reality reproduced" is converted into a "sign." Described thus, the operation of fictionalization is tantamount to the originary emergence of language in a prelinguistic world. If Iser makes no reference to a "signified" or "Idea" intermediary between the worldly referent and the signifier, this is not because he is unaware that the meaning of the word "cow" belongs to another category of being than Bossy over there. On the contrary, in Iser's analysis, the aesthetic sign?on the model, I would add, of the originary sign?can signify only a fictional Bossy; the category of cows-in-general is a subsequent meta physical construction that could not have provided the stimulus for the sign's emergence. The model of the originary sign of human language should not be sought in the stimulus categories that form the content of animal communication. Vervet monkeys have some dozen alarm cries for different categories of enemies, each of which suggests a different mode of action: aggressive attack, flight into the trees, flight along the ground, and so on. But human language begins not with categories but with the unique, a historically eventful singularity that calls not for some particu lar action but for the deferral of all action. Fiction returns to the originary use of language in order to designate a particular element of reality not as belonging to an interesting category but as of interest in itself, as sacred, dangerous, a potential source of mimetic violence. The sacred is what is desired too strongly by too many people to be safely appropriated by any one of them. It can be shared only through the mediation of the sign, which by designating this object implicitly institutes a category of all such objects. The categorical signified does not precede but derives from the unique sacred referent of the originary sign. Just as staging cannot be understood as an elaboration of thinking, so the system of arbitrary significations that distinguishes human language from the associative signals or "calls" of animal communication cannot be understood on the basis of the metaphysical priority of the categori cal signified over the specific referent. The signified or Idea emerges as what the originary sign commemorates when the object to which it referred is no longer present. The first signifier may justifiably be called</page><page sequence="5">STAGING AS AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CATEGORY 49 the "name-of-God" because the word "God" refers to the Idea as an active force or Being, the subsistent center of the scene of representa tion on which the desires of the community are concentrated. The material referent of the sign on the stage of culture is the temporary incarnation of the atemporal central Being that defers mimetic violence through the intermediary of this sign. Although a hypothetical observer from Sirius might claim that this Being is, in its incipience, an illusory projection of the mimetic desires of the group onto the central object, once the linguistic sign exists to commemorate the scene of this projection, we cannot denounce the illusion without condemning language itself. Whatever else we do when we pronounce the name-of God, we minimally commemorate the kernel of transcendence that allows the Idea to take the place of the thing; failing this, human language would be no different from an animal signal system. Let us pursue our originary reading of Iser's text. The sign, having been generated by the fictionalizing/sacralizing act, simultaneously "castfs] the imaginary as a form." The imaginary thus "cast" has heretofore manifested itself "[i]n our ordinary experience ... in fleeting impressions that defy our attempts to pin it down in a concrete and stabilized form" (FI 3). The "form" into which the imaginary is "cast" should be understood as occupying our internal scene of repre sentation on which the sacred fiction is mentally staged. The prelinguistic imagination manifests itself in "fleeting impressions," not merely be cause it lacks linguistic signs to which these impressions may be anchored, but because it lacks a scene on which they can be staged. In the suggestive terms of Derek Bickerton, the prehuman imagination is exclusively occupied with "on-line" appetitive activities directed toward food, shelter, and reproduction, whereas language provides the human brain with neuronal foci around which there can emerge the "off-line" processing of past and future, remembered and hypothetical realities.5 But whereas Bickerton and the linguistic/scientific community in gen eral are at a loss to conjecture what might have given rise to this new, sign-centered imagination, Iser suggests that its origin lies in the act of fictionalization that confers "form" on a particular element of reality. The word "form" in Iser's text carries echoes of the Platonic-Aristote lian eidos but more specifically of the notion of "literary form." It is the latter that "allows us to conceive what it is toward which the sign points," to conceive it not as an Idea but as the object of a staged mimetic performance. The philosophical or metaphysical concept has its source in a "misreading" of the pointing action of the sign. That the sign points, that it is ostensive, is clear both from Iser's text and from our originary interpretation of fictionalization as the designation of the inaccessible sacred object. For the metaphysician, on the contrary, the "form that</page><page sequence="6">50 NEW LITERARY HISTORY allows us to conceive" is precisely that form of utterance which is divorced from the world of pointing: the declarative "What-is" sentence or proposition. We point to the shadows on the wall of the cave, but the Idea or linguistic signified is a transcendent Being that we cannot see to point to. Yet the dependence of Plato's declarative form-as-Concept on the deferral of violence accomplished by the ostensive sacred is revealed by the exemplary ethical role played in his inaugural metaphysics by the Idea of the Good. What is Good is what we can all share without violence, what is beneficial to all members of the society without exception despite their ostensibly divergent selfish interests.6 This unproblematic sharing is understandable only on the model of the originary sign that defers violence by being communicated entire to all participants in the place of the sacred object that cannot both remain whole and be apportioned among them. Yet this deferral cannot automatically be extended into the real world; the sharing of the sign must be followed by the division of the object. Plato's Idea of the Good and, by extension, Platonic metaphysics in general is characterized by the unproblematic conflation of the insubstantial sign and the substan tive object; conflict among individual interests is not transcended but dismissed as misunderstanding, as Socrates dismisses Callicles's glorifica tion of egotism in the Gorgias. Although the source in human experi ence of the Idea of the Good, as of any other Idea, can only be the sacred Good incarnated in ritual by the sacrificial victim and pointed to in secular culture by "fictionalization," the edifice of metaphysics is founded on the denial of any such ostensive origin; the Idea is hypostasized as Being in abstraction from its originary anthropological context. Iser's "form" is literary rather than eidetic; fiction permits us to "conceive" the referent of the sign not as a direct vision of the Idea but through a narrative understanding of human reality. In order that we may "conceive what it is toward which the sign points," narrative explains why the timeless sign has pointed it out by telling us the story of how in time it became significant. Implicit in Iser's text is the awareness of a difference between the mode of cognition by which we apprehend the "reality" in the first half of the sentence, before its conversion into a sign, and that by which we conceive it anew in the second half through the mediation of "form." Iser's sentence reproduces the originary hermeneutic circle: it is as though, by means of our unreflective "prehuman" decision to designate this reality by the sign, we became capable of reflecting on all reality as a potential designatum of the sign. But the term "fictionalization" suggests that this reflection is not a mere matter of circular self-consciousness. If, in the first half of Iser's</page><page sequence="7">STAGING AS AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CATEGORY 51 sentence, we were able to exclude the temporal by translating "fictional ization" as "sacralization," the second half makes clear that we must retain the specificity of its temporal unfolding as "fiction." Through the unitary act of fictionalization whose product is simply "a sign," the imaginary is cast as a form in which our conception of the reality pointed to by the sign will emerge through a temporal or narrative process. (This is true, mutatis mutandis, of plastic as well as temporal art, but I cannot pursue this point here.) Thus the sign referred to is, on the one hand, a minimal, formal sign, a "word" apprehended in the instant, and, on the other, an institutional sign with a beginning and an end revealed only in time, a semiotic entity of which the minimal realiza tion?though its cultural function is no longer concerned with mini mality?is a complete linguistic utterance, a "sentence." Just as the atemporal proposition is the foundation of metaphysics, the literary sentence is the kernel of narrative temporalization, of storytelling. The difference between literary and eidetic form thus distinguishes two modes of passage between ostensive and declarative, word and sentence. We move from pointing out the central being to, on the one hand, detailing its essence in answer to Socrates' ironic "What-is" question in which Nietzsche saw the archetype of metaphysics and, on the other, showing this being in action as an "anthropomorphic" god and ultimately as a mortal. The sign exists qua sign, that is, indepen dently of the scene in which it first appeared, only because its ostensive referent has been transmuted into an "immortal" signified, a commemo rating signification or meaning. Because immortality is a quality of the sign before it can be attributed to sacred being, it is retained by the sign even when it comes to designate a mortal being. The passage from myth to literature is that figured in the Gilgamesh epic between immortality and mortality of the protagonist designated by the sign.7 Yet both Plato and the author of the Gilgamesh epic came "late" to human language. What is the originary basis of the duality that will subsequently be realized explicitly in the two forms, predicative and narrative, of the declarative sentence?which itself may have appeared a million years after the first utterance of Homo habilis? As a representa tional form anterior to both eidetic and literary form, the ostensive sign is more than a mere referential gesture. Its specific difference, to use the terminology of C. S. Peirce, as a symbolic (conventional, "arbitrary") rather than an indexical (associative) sign is the quality of "reproduction" referred to in Iser's sentence; the sign is not a mere conduit toward the object but an object of attention in itself. The originary sign, by designating the object of individual and communal desire, expresses at the same time the signer's renunciation of appetitive designs on it in the face of the concurrent desires of the other members of the community;</page><page sequence="8">52 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the originary sign is an "aborted gesture of appropriation."8 Attention to this sign, as a result of which it may be said not merely to designate but to represent its referent, is already "formal"; the sign mimetically takes on the "form" of the object, which becomes thereby independent of the object itself. In its very spatio-temporal constitution?a gestural sign would be both spatial and temporal?the sign cuts itself off from the worldly space-time of horizontal appetitive relations. Even before the declarative sentence's explicit construction of a predicative form, either temporal/narrative or atemporal/metaphysical, the ostensive form both shows us what it is that it points to and at the same time "tells the story" of its pointing in the temporality internal to the performance of the sign itself, beginning with the gesture of appropriation and ending with the sign of renunciation.9 This temporalization of the sign within the terms of Iser's exposition prefigures his later discussion of "staging as an anthropological cat egory." But first, his book leads us from fictionalization through theories of the imaginary to the notion of "text as play" and, in the Epilogue, to the categories of mimesis and performance. The thrust of Iser's historical analysis is to demonstrate that, since Aristotle's defense of mimesis against Plato, aesthetic theory, following aesthetic practice, has evolved from a model of art as representing or "imitating" something already given to one in which art generates a "phantasm" in the reader's consciousness. In Aristotelian terms, art grows progressively less "mimetic." Yet, curiously enough, Iser's histori cal account of aesthetic liberation from the origin is accompanied by a growing undercurrent of originary thinking in his own text. The notion of "staging" emerges within the text of The Fictive and the Imaginary as an irruption of repressed ostensivity. Why return to the slavery of mimesis from the freedom of "play" if the category of "fictionalization" had already settled the question of the non-given nature of aesthetic representation? And after the givenness of mimesis has, once again, been dissolved in the "phantasm," why introduce, a few pages from the end of the book, the new and this time unambiguously scenic concept of "staging"?"as an anthropological category"? Here is Iser's explanation: "If representation is phantasmic figuration, it becomes a means of staging that gives appearance to something that by nature is intangible" (77296). Thus in the very moment at which the object of representation becomes altogether "phantasmic," the "stage" of representation is called for in order to "give [it] appearance." This is the procedure described earlier as "casting the imaginary as a form," but now the no longer sufficient abstraction of "form" has been replaced by the concreteness of the "stage." We now realize that the narrativity of literary "form" in the</page><page sequence="9">STAGING AS AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CATEGORY 53 sentence quoted from chapter 1 had been dependent on the stageable significance of the prior "reality" that was converted into "a sign." Whereas the earlier statement was made from the standpoint of classical representation as "imitation of nature," that taken from the epilogue alludes to the modernity of the phantasm in contrast to the originary object of mimetic representation. Now the imagination can no longer be brought back to reality by the sign, which has been replaced by the vaguer term "representation" as an indication that the earlier distinction between the "sign" and the "reality" it "reproduced" can no longer be maintained. What we have now is a "staging" that, rather than "repro ducing" a chosen segment of reality, must itself realize or "give appear ance to" the "intangible" phantasm of the imagination. The added concreteness of "staging" over "form" offsets the loss of concreteness from mimesis to "phantasm." But whereas in the earlier passage the significance of the "reality" to be imitated was taken for granted, now the "staging" of the imaginary content situates it explicitly in an institu tional, indeed, a ritual context. The metaphor of staging brings to mind the origin of the stage as an altar raised above the everyday world for the conduct of sacred rites. From the formal gesture that converts a selected portion of reality into a sign, we have progressed to the institutional activity of ritual in which the originary scene is reproduced. That which is staged is not a single moment but a temporal sequence in which the instantaneous, formal act of signification is contained as a figure within its ground. What is staged must enter, perform upon, then leave the stage; in Aristotle's terms, the dramatic action must contain a beginning, a middle, and an end. Yet the deritualized, literary concept of staging is cut off from what Iser describes as myth's pretension to know the beginning and religion's claim to know the end: "Etiological myths are the beginning and prophecies are the end" (FI 298). Unlike either sacrificial myth or soteriological religion, literature exists in a context where beginnings and ends cannot be anchored in reality without falling into Utopian illusion. Indeed, whatever knowledge we have of beginnings and ends, the nature of staging itself already implies that it is the dramatic agon in the "middle" that must be performed in order to validate or renew this knowledge. To stage an action is to locate it in the sacred middle/center surrounded both spatially and temporally by the profane. The begin ning and end are the before and after of the sacred act that we encountered earlier as the fictionalizing creation of the sign. Whence the dual temporality of narrative. On the one hand, as "form," the middle is the singular central moment, the decisive act around which temporal density is supplied by prologue and epilogue. On the other, as</page><page sequence="10">54 NEW LITERARY HISTORY "content," the middle is what supplies body to the timeline on which beginning and end, entrance and exit are mere endpoints. We experi ence narrative form as atemporal closure, narrative content as time lived in the world of its characters. But in the course of literary history, the formal moment of sacrifice that defines the before and after of the sacred rite is reproduced in the imaginary world of literary narrative with increasing ambiguity, more in comedy than tragedy, still more in the phantasms of modernity. In Beckett's "fantasy" Imagination Dead Imagine, which provides (FI 238-46) Iser's ultimate example, the imagination's imagining of its own death achieves a maximally inextri cable ambiguity between the two senses of "death": as a state and as a moment of passage. This ever-increasing literary indecisiveness is always already inherent in sacrifice itself. All sacrifice is staged rather than spontaneous, temporal rather than instantaneous. Temporalization, the filling of sacrificial form with content that makes it understandable to us as sacrifice, is of the same nature as its secularization, its "fall" into literature. The progress of this "fall," through which literature becomes both more staged and less decisive, is the privileged object of literary history. Iser's analysis of this modern indecisiveness as a reflection or doubling of the cathartic "response" to which the spectator/reader's desire is "lured" is a crucial contribution to the postmodern paradigm shift in this field of study by which literature's reflection of history has come to be grasped as a process within the literary text itself. It is a relatively straightforward task to construct an originary model of the sign, however difficult it may be to integrate it into the scientific discourse of human evolution. But the temporality of staging "that gives appearance to something . . . intangible" can be modeled only in the most abstract sense. In the historical retelling of the Ur-story of the emergence of human language from mere signals and of human desire?and the possibility of love?from mere appetite, the very retemporalization of the sign that is storytelling insures that we cannot fill in the details. Originary thinking can nonetheless contribute an additional layer of modeling to Iser's exposition. The metaphor of staging underlines the presence on the aesthetic scene not merely of "phantasms" but of actors, real persons whose symmetrical and always potentially agonistic confrontations on stage incarnate the fragile harmony and conflictive potential of mimesis. In Ren? Girard's "triangular" model of mimetic desire, the disciple's pious repetition of the model's gesture is at the same time an act of rivalrous usurpation. All drama is mimesis of conflict because conflict is inherent in mimesis itself. It is because the Ur-story is not simply one of unrealized possibility but</page><page sequence="11">STAGING AS AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CATEGORY 55 of conflict and resolution that we need "staging," not merely in the form of ritual but in that of secular fiction. To perform representations on stage is to explore their potential for generating the significance that emerges from mimetic conflict and the necessity of its deferral. It is in this light that we should read the final paragraph of Iser's book: The need for staging is marked by a duality that defies cognitive unraveling. On the one hand, staging allows us?at least in our fantasy?to lead an ecstatic life by stepping out of what we are caught up in, in order to open up for ourselves what we are otherwise barred from. On the other hand, staging reflects us as the ever-fractured "holophrase," so that we constantly speak to ourselves through the possibilities of our otherness in a speaking that is a form of stabilization. Both apply, and both can occur simultaneously. Precisely because cognitive discourse cannot capture the duality adequately, we have literature. (FI 303) This apparently irenic passage does not lack for indications of either the violence of mimetic conflict or the necessity of its deferral: interdic tion, transgressive ecstasy, fracture, otherness, duality, and the slightly sinister "stabilization." What we are "barred from" is the sacred center of the stage, the locus of sacrifice that we cannot usurp without provoking collective violence. But, as Iser's exposition shows, the aesthetic is not limited to a usurpatory wish-fulfillment. What truly produces "stabiliza tion"?the deferral of violence that culture obtains by means of repre sentation?is that we continue to "speak to ourselves" through the unreal possibility of this staging. Our very humanity originates in the scenic center where we must stand in order to become users of language but that we can occupy only on the fictional stage of our imagination. This subject, "ever-fractured" by the tension between the resentful periphery and the impossible center, may be described more simply, as linguists do, as the one who says "I." In order to become the "subject" who says "I," we must understand ourselves simultaneously as center and as periphery, both as the sacred source of language and as one of those "subjected" to it. Yet "understand" is not quite the right word, since it implies a cognitive model within which the paradox has already been resolved. Cognition, in the form of originary anthropology, offers us a metaresolution, a minimal model of what the human must be in order to give life to this paradox through a praxis of desire. Such a model, and the discourse that elaborates it, can be historicized to describe the possibilities available to this praxis at the different evolutionary stages of the human exchange system. But our model cannot be made to anticipate the new degrees of freedom that will be the product of this praxis, along with the new possibilities of desire and mimetic conflict that they in turn will generate. This anticipation can only be lived in our</page><page sequence="12">56 NEW LITERARY HISTORY imagination if it is staged as fiction. Thus in order to reaffirm our solidarity with the emergent freedom of the originary event that defines the unity of the human, we need, as Iser tells us, not merely language, but literature. University of California, Los Angeles NOTES 1 Wolfgang Iser, The Fictive and the Imaginary (Baltimore, 1993); hereafter cited in text as FI 2 My own hypothesis of the common origin of language and ritual was first presented in Eric Gans, The Origin of Language (Berkeley, 1981); the most recent version is found in my Signs of Paradox (Stanford, 1997). 3 A partial exception to this rule is Terrence Deacon's The Symbolic Species (New York, 1997). The author refers explicitly to ritual as the means by which "symbolic" human language could have been learned, without however taking into account ritual's sacral and sacrificial nature. 4 I can mention here only in passing Iser's insightful essay "What is Literary Anthropol ogy? The Difference between Explanatory and Exploratory Fictions," to appear in Revenge of the Aesthetic: The Place of Literature in Theory Today, ed. Michael Clark (Berkeley, forthcoming 2000), which contrasts the open-ended "exploratory" anthropological model of literary play with the "explanatory" "recursive looping" of generative anthropology. This contrast is sharpened in Iser's interview with Richard van Oort, "The Use of Fiction in Literary and Generative Anthropology," Anthropoetics, 3.2 (Fall 1997/Winter 1998), &lt;http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/anthropoetics/ap0302/iser_int.htm&gt;, where he explicitly associates his own critical method with the "exploratory" as opposed to the "explanatory" model. 5 See Derek Bickerton, Language and Human Behavior (Seattle, 1995). 6 See my "Plato and the Birth of Conceptual Thought," Anthropoetics, 2.2 (Fall 1996/ Winter 1997), &lt;http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/anthropoetics/ap0202/plato.htm&gt;; also in Signs of Paradox, ch. 6, pp. 75-91. 7 See my The End of Culture (Berkeley, 1985), ch. 8, pp. 179-88. 8 See Signs of Paradox, ch. 2, pp. 13-36. 9 This process of detemporalization is discussed at greater length in Signs of Paradox, ch. 2, and in my "Originary Narrative," Anthropoetics, 3.2 (Fall 1997/Winter 1998), &lt;http.// www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/anthropoetics/ap0302/narrative.htm&gt;. Very briefly, the sign as "aborted gesture of appropriation" is detached from its worldly temporality as a practical act by the sacred inaccessibility of the common central desire-object. At this point, it becomes an object of attention in itself, not a mere pointing-to but a sign of the object that is, at the same time, a "sign" to the other participants of the sign-maker's renunciation of appropriative designs on this object.</page></plain_text>
