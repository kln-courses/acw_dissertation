<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ferrules of Engagement: The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses Elizabeth Inglesby Stephen Dedalus brings to Ulysses certain ideas associated with his early attempts to become a creator: his pledge to "go to encounter for the mil- lionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race" ( Portrait 275-76), for example, and his youthful definition of artistic epiphany, which Joyce renovates consid- erably in Ulysses. Stephen's attempts to "read the signatures of all things" in Ulysses begin in "Telemachus" and continue in the "Proteus" episode, showing some of the results of his efforts to progress as an artist: primar- ily, his tendency, when encountering material reality, to forge - create and simultaneously falsify - a text with which to encapsulate what he sees be- fore him (37). He habitually cobbles together his own cursory observations and fragments of others' words and ideologies. This proclivity, coupled with his view of objects as pretexts for creating epiphanies out of the mun- dane, demonstrates the solipsistic strain in Stephen that Joyce will counter in the novel by using the very materials with which his young protagonist imprisons his consciousness: objects and words. The underexamined story in Ulysses is that of the minutiae that some- times seem beneath the notice even of those who set out to examine trivia. We might call this category of details the "throwaways," to borrow Joyce's name in Ulysses for an amalgamation of horse, paper scrap, and prophet, except that to do so suggests that they share the same prominent status as "Elijah Throwaway," an entity who receives a fair amount of overt atten- tion from both the narrative voices and Bloom. To find the deeper founda- tions of the phenomenal world in Joyce, it is necessary to move beyond examinations of items that Joyce presents as talismans, symbols, or ob- jects that characters respond to with focused, conscious attention, such as the kind Stephen employs when he seeks out an epiphany. Presences so unobtrusive and incidental that they appear thoroughly dispensable at first glance provide the bedrock for Joyce's creation, a crucial layer of linguistic and material reality in which a blade of grass occupies the same Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 56, No. 3, Fall 2014 © 2014 by the University of Texas Press DOI: 10.7560 /TSLL56303</page><page sequence="2">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 293 moral, etymological, and physical universe as the giant, the budding ge- nius, or the Everyman. Ordinary things, such as plants, furnishings, or pieces of jewelry, "speak" in unexpected ways in Ulysses , allowing the author to challenge traditional hierarchies of importance that have long dominated discussions of humanity's place in the physical realm; these items encourage a reconsideration of both the way in which we envision our own significance among the props we habitually undervalue, disre- gard, or misunderstand, and the power of language to create and reorder that understanding. Before Ulysses begins, Stephen is no stranger to the concept of trivia as vital to the formulation of aesthetic theory. As he tells Cranly in Stephen Hero , Stephen's concept of epiphany depends upon singling out details and focusing upon them until they yield a vision that moves both object and viewer beyond ordinary comprehension: "This triviality made him think of collecting many such moments together in a book of epiphanies. By an epiphany he meant 'a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the mind itself' ... He told Cranly that the clock of the Ballast Office was capable of an epiphany" (211). Stephen's early formulation of this process when he applies it to objects, however, depends largely on an action that takes place in the observer's mind: "Imagine my glimpses at that clock as the gropings of a spiritual eye which seeks to adjust its vision to an exact fo- cus. The moment the focus is reached the object is epiphanised. It is just in this epiphany that I find the third, the supreme quality of beauty" (211). Stephen's use of passive voice to describe what happens to the object em- phasizes its helplessness as the subject's eye not only regards, but "gropes" for it; his syntax demonstrates his belief in the primacy of the perceiving subject, going so far as to make "focusing," rather than actually seeing, the supreme act of any epiphany. As he continues to lecture Cranly, however, he makes a grammatical and ideological leap that he can neither sustain nor explain fully, as he ascribes a fleeting use of agency to his object: The mind considers the object in whole and in part, in relation to itself and to other objects, examines the balance of its parts, contemplates the form of the object, traverses every cranny of the structure. So the mind receives the impression of the symmetry of the object. The mind recognises that the object is in the strict sense of the word, a thing , a definitely constituted entity. You see? . . . Now for the third quality. For a long time I couldn't make out what Aquinas meant. He uses a figurative word (a very unusual thing for him) but I have solved it. Claritas is quidditas. [Italicized in original] After the analysis which discovers the second quality the mind makes the only logically pos- sible synthesis and discovers the third quality. This is the moment which I call epiphany. First we recognise that the object is one integral</page><page sequence="3">294 Elizabeth Inglesby thing, then we recognise that it is an organised composite structure, a thing in fact: finally, when the relation of the parts is exquisite, when the parts are adjusted to the special point, we recognise that it is that thing which it is. Its soul, its whatness, leaps to us from the vestment of its appearance. The soul of the commonest object, the structure of which is so adjusted, seems to us radiant. The object achieves its epiphany. (213) In this explanation, Stephen makes a number of assumptions that guide his thinking about the relationship between subject and object. First, he perhaps unwittingly admits a bias toward objects that stand out for their visual symmetry, a preference that would presumably narrow the field of things likely to capture the mind's attention. The clock, for example, with its geometric design and vaguely human-like "face/7 makes an easy target for the appreciator of symmetrical unity or harmony. The next part of Stephen's explanation underscores the importance of language as a par- ticipant in seeing the object: "the object is in the strictest sense of the word, a thing." The entity is "definitely constituted" in part by the act of naming. Stephen's vocabulary then becomes murkier, as he tries to articulate the next phase of recognition, in which the beholder sees the object "adjusted" to a "special point." Adjusted by what or whom? Does the adjustment oc- cur as an action within the perceiving eye, like focusing? Is it a linguistic adjustment? Or is it a reorganizing or shifting movement within the object itself, needing no further outside interference to bring it about? Stephen's theory sheds little light on these questions. He waxes tau- tological, deciding that the object "is that thing which it is," then switches from passive to active voice, concluding that the item in question has a "soul," and that "its whatness leaps to us from the vestment of its appear- ance." This last phrase adds a spiritual dimension to the object, perhaps as an attempt to create a balancing counterpart for the "spiritual eye" that he mentions earlier. The object suddenly takes on more anthropomorphic qualities as it seems to don garments: "vestments" that have hitherto seemed to be the object are now merely coverings from which the soul of the thing will have to emerge in order to actualize itself.1 In this version of epiphany, the object is allowed one bold surge into action and agency, but Stephen quickly snatches authority back from it, returning his attention to the eye of the beholder as the locus of the "seeming" radiance it per- ceives. The last sentence offers a puzzling and unresolved final reversal to active voice, stating that the object has "achieved" - earned or enacted - epiphany. Taken as a whole, however, this passage suggests that perhaps Stephen might just as easily have said that "the object receives its epiph- any." Stephen has yet to confront this inherent discrepancy in his formu- lation. It will take another novel and a greatly expanded field of play for Joyce to grapple more fully with the contradictions inherent in Stephen's</page><page sequence="4">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 295 idea. The fact that the theory contains so many unsettled points of revolu- tion illustrates the difficulties inherent in Joyce's consideration of objects as anything more than convenient loci for organizing human thought and emotion. As Joyce works in Ulysses to destabilize the notion of singular, co- herent consciousness, however, he creates more opportunities to contem- plate the nature and degree of the distance we work to maintain between ourselves as subjects and everything outside of ourselves as objects.2 Fallacies of the Familiar Joyce employs both Stephen and Bloom, as well as other voices with vary- ing preoccupations, sensitivities, and limitations, in the service of explor- ing the untold story of the world they inhabit, all the while demonstrating that the active presence of characters does not render their environment an inert stage upon which to play out their dramas or a tapestry woven entirely of human design, hanging as a backdrop. The "Proteus" episode, in which Stephen strolls along Sandymount Strand, opening and closing his eyes, checking to see if the world disappears when he cannot see it, and vowing to "read the signatures of all things," seems a logical place to begin an examination of Joyce's thinking about the meaning of the mate- rial, as it features a character with a keen interest in contemplating the nature of physical reality. Stephen's objective, however, may point readers in the wrong direction if they rely chiefly upon him to make legible the mysterious qualities of the natural and synthetic phenomena he encoun- ters. His desire to penetrate the veil that separates him from the things he wishes to read should not be taken at face value. As Joyce reveals in "Telemachus," Stephen's literacy, as it pertains to objects before him, is both painfully self-referential and deeply informed by the books he has devoured. He seems doomed to regurgitate quotations when faced with the task of decoding unfamiliar or unwritten texts. His failure to read his surroundings exposes what Joyce encourages us to recognize as deeply entrenched human assumptions about objects: that they are inert and indif- ferent, lifeless and uncomprehending. Ulysses offers opportunities to ques- tion these assumptions, but Joyce's audience must move past Stephen's readings in order to recognize that the inanimate world has its own narra- tive - just as language itself in the novel has its own narrative, even while characters are adopting both things and words for proprietary purposes. Ulysses begins by giving Stephen ample opportunities to try out his ideas about his material surroundings as he begins his day in contem- plation of the visible. He immediately illustrates the problem of seeing without cluttering his vision with multiple, often literary, associations or giving in to narcissistic urges. "Telemachus" offers the first glimpse of a young man whose thoughts never stray far from his miseries and fears as he interprets them with the help of his knowledge of the philosophers</page><page sequence="5">296 Elizabeth Inglesby and literary artists he admires. During his morning conversation with Haines and Buck Mulligan, Stephen aches with misery over the death of his mother and the guilt he feels at not having granted her dying wish that he pray with her. He also worries over his status as an outsider and a misunderstood artist whom Buck cruelly teases and Haines seems deter- mined to treat as an Irish curiosity. As he banters with Buck and Haines, Stephen recalls bits of text he learned in school or church, or from read- ing Wilde and Swinburne. He begins to assemble from these odd lines and from elements of the scene around him the narrative of his impend- ing, self-imposed exile from the tower where he has been sleeping. Ob- jects seem to stay in the background for him as shadowy extensions of his own anxieties. In an act of authorial mimicry and playful mockery of Stephen's dependence upon his education to help him comprehend reality, Joyce briefly introduces in "Telemachus" a literary predecessor of his own, Walt Whitman.3 Alluding to the poeťs democratic ideals concerning people, objects, and natural phenomena, Joyce exposes, through highly indirect means, the narrowness of Stephen's point of view. Whitman's "Song of Myself" provides a model of expansive thinking that often treats nonhu- man entities, such as plants, animals, tools, and household items, with a respect and interest similar to that afforded the human multitudes that people the poem. The irony of the title comes from the fact that one of its main themes is the enfolding of the self with "multitudes" of other people, things, and natural phenomena, so that it becomes nearly impossible to tell where the self ends and the rest of the world begins. In order to "celebrate self," Whitman celebrates the inherent fallacy of seeing himself as fun- damentally divisible from the world at large, or from his audience: "For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you" (Whitman 21). He asks his reader, "Have you reckon'd the earth much?/ Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?" (21-22) - a question that resonates with Joyce's design for "Proteus," in which he will test Stephen's ability to find a way of reading that does not obscure the text at hand by pasting over it with other texts. Whitman's "uniform hieroglyphic," the "leaves of grass" that form both the title of his famous volume of poetry and a central metaphor of abundance, fertility, vitality, and vibrant stillness, combines with his conviction that his status as a material creature among the phenomena, a leaf among leaves, affords him limitless opportunities to try out different modes of understanding: To me all the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow, All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means. ... I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue</page><page sequence="6">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 297 cut with a burnt stick at night. ... I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood, I see that elementary laws never apologize, (I reckon that I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.) I exist as I am, that is enough, If no other in the world be aware I sit content, And if each and all be aware I sit content. (404-15) These lines may make Whitman's speaker sound as though he would be pleased to play the role of an inanimate object, sitting placidly and mak- ing no effort to justify or explain his existence, but the poem as a whole suggests that he finds irresistible the urge to try to speak with a voice both human and inhuman, to merge as completely as possible with the mate- rial and articulate his sense of indivisibility from the long catalogue of things both natural and synthetic that collectively form the sprawling self in whom he revels. Ulysses reveals a similar impulse to attempt to penetrate the silence of the object-world and to write its voice into the novel, preserving all the while an awareness of the impossibility of ever fully liberating this voice from the very human language Joyce employs to try to capture it. Rather than fighting this circumstance, he uses it to undermine Stephen's defini- tion of epiphany, broadening its basis, reordering the primacy of the sub- ject and object, and demonstrating the relatively puny scale of revelations that depend on the precarious stability of ephemeral moments of human mental focus. Against a faintly sketched, Whitmanesque framework, Joyce suggests that Stephen hampers his own efforts to arrive at an authentic understanding of his place in the universe precisely by focusing too ex- clusively on the content - both original and borrowed - of his mind as the mediator of reality. The references to Whitman's poem of inclusiveness act as an underground epigraph for "Telemachus" and for the story of objects throughout the novel: a buried plot that one might follow alongside the more overt concerns of the characters. The poet's shadowy presence sug- gests that some of Stephen's limitations, and more generally, humanity's perceptual shortfalls, might be overcome in the long term by enlarging the scope of regard to include more than just the obviously sentient, such as the milkmaid that Stephen underpays or the dog he encounters later on the strand. Ulysses suggests that we must also try to understand things as more than just commodities, symbols, or mirrors of ourselves, for example. Whitman's influence steals into the chapter through a combination of direct quotation and visual cues, and helps to emphasize etymological and empathetic connections between objects ostensibly on the sidelines of the characters' actions. Joyce's method of introduction depends on subtlety;</page><page sequence="7">298 Elizabeth Inglesby he quietly links seemingly disparate elements of the scene by using liter- ary allusion as a medium for bringing forward a point about a dimen- sion of reality that people normally ignore. The connections that reveal this dimension hinge, in part, upon the proximity in the episode of Buck's cavalier swipes at the grasses he encounters along the way to the beach and Stephen's belief that his ashplant is calling his name. In this episode, Stephen watches Buck dressing to leave the Martello tower for a swim. Joyce describes this action in a paragraph that anthropomorphizes Buck's clothing and introduces Whitman directly into the text, but fails to specify completely whose particular mind is responsible for either inclusion: And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie, [Buck] spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. Agenbite of inwit. God, we'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict my- self? Very well then, I contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands. (16-17) The passage is a study in deliberate ambiguity. Buck seems to be respon- sible for personifying his clothes, as he is the one speaking to and chid- ing them. The word "rebellious" would seem to belong to him. However, Joyce's later insertion, in the Paris text of 1922, of "Agenbite of inwit," Stephen's oft-repeated mantra, suggests that much of the paragraph may actually be Stephen's creation. The speaker or thinker of the next line is unclear. Is it Buck talking about the activity in which he is currently en- gaged, or is it Stephen, sardonically imagining himself taking up the dress code of his aesthetic predecessors? The "contradiction" at the heart of the passage also remains unspecified, and the Whitman quotation that follows could conceivably come from either Stephen or Buck, since both seem to share a proclivity for frustrating or contradicting the expectations of oth- ers. Critics disagree about the provenance of the quotation; Harold Bloom ( Joyce's "Ulysses" 23) and Richard Ellmann ("Ulysses" on the Liffey 17), for example, credit Buck with uttering it, while Kevin Dettmar ( The Illicit Joyce of Postmodernism 19) attributes it to Stephen. The passage as a whole con- tains up to four speakers: Buck, Stephen, Whitman, and an anonymous third-person voice that might be Stephen, Buck, or an unidentified narra- tor. This confusion results in the Whitman reference belonging, perhaps, to no character in particular, but more generally to the episode itself.4 Indeed, "Telemachus" appears to owe more to Whitman than just this singular in- stance of direct quotation: section 33 of "Song of Myself" finds Whitman's speaker contemplating having "walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the morning" and "hauling my boat down the shallow river,/ Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead,/ Where the buck turns</page><page sequence="8">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 299 furiously at the hunter,/ . . . Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush" (46-47). These images correspond with the location, activities, conversational topics (Stephen has been complain- ing that Haines talked of shooting a panther in his sleep), and even one of the nicknames of Joyce's characters in "Telemachus." The last line quoted above from section 33 of "Song of Myself" - "Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush" - proves to be particularly useful because it points directly to a moment crucial to understanding the speech of unheard things in Ulysses. While in the foreground the characters engage one another in conversa- tions about art, religion, and politics, Joyce creates an understory of the material world as it collides with callous and unthinking human behavior and tries to make itself heard. After dressing, Buck, Haines, and Stephen, carrying his ashplant, leave the tower for the shore. Stephen hears Buck behind him, "club[bing] with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses," and addressing them as though they were on the attack: "Down, sir. How dare you, sir?" (17). He chides the vegetation in much the same tone as he has just scolded his clothing, continuing his simple, play- ful personification and perhaps adding weight to Stephen's perception of him as gratuitously violent and destructive. Joyce makes clear, though, that Buck's gesture is directed not at Stephen, but at the "leader shoots" - in the original manuscript, "upreared ferns or grasses" (1 7).5 Stephen's thoughts, in line with his universalized sense of victimhood, stay reso- lutely focused on himself, his weariness, and his ridiculous appearance: "his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires" (18). The moment ends with Buck, about to dive into the "fortyfoot hole, . . . tugg[ing] swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell" (19). Buck apparently considers the ashplant an extension of Stephen, and his good-bye to or through it serves as a reminder of both its totemic status and its persistent presence as a witness to human activity. Joyce then sets the scene for the phenomenal to undercut the cere- bral by using the inanimate to highlight the narrowness of the characters' opinions about religious belief. He displays Stephen, in particular, as a model of overinflated self-referentiality, deaf and blind to phenomena not immediately participating in the drama of his suffering. As soon as Buck is out of earshot, Haines baits Stephen with the topic of blasphemy, claim- ing not to be a "believer in the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God." Stephen answers him: "There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me" (19). In Stephen's conception of faith, there is room for only one kind of unbelief: the kind of deliberate turning away from irrational religious ideas and ritual that brings him guilt when he thinks about how he demonstrated it at the deathbed of his mother by refusing to pray (19). His unwitting role as the impercipi- ent in Joyce's tale of the material becomes clearer when Haines moves to</page><page sequence="9">300 Elizabeth Inglesby draw Stephen into further conversation. At this moment, using Stephen's walking stick, Joyce exposes his protagonist's inability to examine his own philosophical boundaries by revealing his lack of awareness of any shad- owy world outside of himself and the human systems he has studied and internalized. Haines continues: - Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a per- sonal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose? - You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought. He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My familiar, after me, calling Steeeeeeeeeeeephen. A wavering line along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. (20) This moment is revealing not only because it uncovers crucial aspects of Stephen's spiritual crisis, his tortured relationship with the abstract con- cept of "free" thought and his unconscious comparison of himself with a suffering Christ dragging his cross, but also because it marks one of the first instances in which Joyce gives an object a noticeable speaking voice. The ashplant, with its timely shriek, appears to Stephen to act in fulfillment of his need for verbal response to his statement. Stephen un- doubtedly feels that it does, as he refers to the stick as "my familiar," sub- stituting, perhaps unwittingly, a supernatural relationship long associated with witchcraft for Haines's idea of a "personal god." However, the nature of the speaking object, the ferrule, and the way in which Stephen hears and interprets its squeal allow Joyce both to expose Stephen's narcissistic sensibilities and to write past them to get to the story of the object and the implications that story holds for the rest of the material world in the novel. Juxtaposed with Stephen's double-edged admission that he is a "hor- rible example of a freethinker" is a demonstration for the audience of just how firmly Stephen is shackled to his own miserable perspective. The fer- rule of his ashplant scrapes the ground, and Stephen hears only his name. The text, however, hears the voice of the object itself, and subtly connects it with both Buck's attack on the grasses and ferns, moments before, and with Whitman's vision of the grass as a symbol of our deep connection with and ultimate indivisibility from other phenomena with which we share the universe.6 Read from this angle, the ashplant's cry becomes a shrill protest of the brusque self-absorption of its human counterparts and of the violence visited upon the leader shoots moments before. In the original manuscript, Joyce spelled "ferrule" with one "r" - a mistake that necessitated a change to the Paris text of 1922. As he checked the spelling, this correction afforded him an opportunity to think more</page><page sequence="10">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 301 deeply about the linguistic reverberations it brings to the episode. The two words share a rich and interesting relationship, one well suited to Joyce's purposes as he strives to call our attention to the smallest material details of the novel. A "ferrule" is "a ring or cap of metal put round the end of a stick, tube, etc., to strengthen it, or prevent splitting or wearing" ("ferrule, n."). The modern English word is derived from Latin and related to ferrum and verrei , meaning iron and bracelets. "Ferule" is both an alternate spelling of "ferrule" and a word referring, in its noun form, to "a genus of plants, the giant fennel," "a plant or stalk of it" (akin to "festuca/' a blade of grass or any of the genus of the parsley family), or "a rod" ("ferule, n.") In its verb form, it means "to beat, strike with a ferule" ("ferule, v."). Sud- denly, etymological and physical resonances between Stephen's supposed "familiar" and the vegetation that takes a beating in this episode enable us to recognize empathetic connections that Joyce draws between things without the help or comprehension of characters.7 By handling these words as though they are objects with weighty ma- terial presence and noticeable physiological similarities, or perhaps even living creatures that share bloodlines, Joyce demonstrates the power that they have to reorder the way in which his audience apprehends both char- acter and what has traditionally been dismissed as mere scene setting or stage props. Stephen, lost in his own thoughts, cannot make the connec- tion, so the author challenges his audience to take up the slack by learning to listen for the unexpected ways in which objects speak in the novel. Joyce has restructured the definition of "epiphany" to reflect more emphatically how things and the words we use to describe them control, to a great extent, what we are able to focus on during a moment of realization or clarity. If readers register it, this particular revelation concerning the la- tent sensitivity or responsiveness of the inanimate happens almost entirely through language that binds together images of violence, its victims, and the mouthpiece that draws attention to them.8 Neither the seeing eye of a character/ witness nor the thinking "I" of a character /interpreter takes charge of "focusing" for us. Joyce's remodeled, underground epiphany depends not, as Stephen has outlined, on seeing an object as "one integral thing," but on picking up on the myriad subtle connections that link one mode of being to others, an act that calls to mind the idea of metempsycho- sis carried through the novel as a whole. The "soul" or "whatness" of these speaking objects in "Telemachus" leaps toward the audience from several directions at once, not primarily through one clearly identifiable organiz- ing mind, but through finer filaments of continuity - literary, etymologi- cal, physiological, ethical - embedded in the text. The use of one form of "whatness" to illuminate another becomes one of the many methods that Joyce employs to challenge the notion of the singular, coherent conscious- ness confidently surveying its surroundings, certain that it has not missed anything of importance. Just as actual objects must become words in order</page><page sequence="11">302 Elizabeth Inglesby to exist in books, Ulysses makes words behave as much as possible like objects to underscore the potential power that they have to impinge upon the vision of both the characters and the audience. As the passage above comes to an end, Stephen plays a role in creating the "wavering line along the path," but the novel offers the possibility that the line belongs to the ashplant itself as much as to the young man drag- ging it. As the ferrule leaves a signature in the dirt, Stephen again wants to appropriate it. He thinks of how the others will trample over it later, perhaps as a gesture of disregard for his potential as a writer, or an echo of the way in which Buck has trampled his feelings by speaking callously of May Dedalus's death. Despite Stephen's sense that the ashplant is an extension of himself, it also emerges as an object capable, in one sense, of speaking and writing its own version of the salient points of this scene. It leaves its mark in the text, emphasizing, as it bears un-silent witness to the behavior of its human counterparts, the extraordinary blindness of those who claim to be phenomenal readers.9 In an echo of Stephen's fear of neglect, Joyce acknowledges, with the ashplant's imperiled signature, the possibility that he has buried the tale of the object-world so deeply within the novel that it risks being trampled over by the more conventionally ar- ticulated stories of the characters and the objects they single out for special attention. In this way, the ashplant, momentarily a pen, also draws our at- tention back to the interface of the physical and the cerebral encapsulated in the act of writing a book. Objects in the text that appear in tandem with Stephen stand a great chance of being swept away by the waves of tormented, hypertextual thought that accompany many of his attempts to encounter reality in all its various forms.10 From the beginning of the novel, Joyce takes pains to establish Stephen's unreliability as an observer of the material world. First of all, his myopia, made worse than usual by his having lost his glasses, makes seeing the phenomenal world a physical challenge for Stephen, who attempts to compensate through thinking. As "Proteus" opens grandiloquently with Stephen's announcement of his chosen topic of contemplation, "Ineluctable modality of the visible, at least that if no more, thought through my eyes," Joyce prepares to demonstrate that this kind of "seeing" will be inadequate to the task of taking in all the rich- ness of his surroundings, causing Stephen to continue to forge, rather than read, the "signatures of all things" (37). His walk on the strand finds him noticing "seaspawn and seawrack," among other items, but his "readings" of the beach vegetation are heavily pasted over with romantically tinged language that all but obscures their existence as actual plants: Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night</page><page sequence="12">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 303 by night: lifted, flooded, and let fall. Lord, they are weary: and whis- pered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit . [Italicized in original] To no end gathered. Vainly then released, forth flowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters. (49) In this attempt at crafting pathetic fallacy, Stephen cannot long maintain the integrity of even a simple form of personification because he floods the passage with so many references: to popular songs and the writings of St. Ambrose and Dryden, for example.11 Though Stephen's thought process begins with a moment of sympathetic contemplation of the gestures of the underwater fronds, the weeds themselves are soon forgotten in Stephen's haste to move from image to allusion, and it seems more important to him to note that Saint Ambrose had an aesthetic experience similar to his than to spend much time in careful observation himself of the natural phenom- ena before him. He looks at the fronds in order to see not them, but their literary correlates as his mind has already envisioned them.12 Abandoning the image of "leaves awaiting their time" (another reminder of Whitman), Stephen quickly scurries on to the next in his set of associations: a naked woman from Dryden's MacFlecknoe . His ashplant, significantly, waits pre- cariously nearby, poised to "float away" like Stephen's awareness of the solidity of the things he sees before him and converts so readily to texts of his own design ( Ulysses 49). His process of paring away the original object of focus until it becomes purely a literary allusion stands in contrast to the way in which Joyce manipulates allusions and verbal associations in "Telemachus" in order to foreground, briefly, objects that the characters customarily treat carelessly or misunderstand, like the leader shoots and the ashplant. Joyce uses these items to illustrate the brittle illusion of hege- mony his characters struggle to maintain over their material surroundings. The story of the ashplant, with its vocal ferrule and its linguistic and physiological cousins, continues throughout Ulysses , expanding an ety- mological continuity into a multiform echo in the text as Joyce peppers the novel with ferulaic variants: bracelets, grasses, fronds, sticks, canes, umbrellas, and the like.13 Sometimes, they simply flash briefly as physical elements of a scene or intrude upon the thoughts of the characters but still fail to receive the full recognition of the mind that pictures them. Joyce disperses them throughout the various episodes like shadowy messengers to remind the audience of what it has earlier witnessed: callous human attitudes and behavior toward the nonhuman, and blindness toward the life of the inanimate world that can also indicate blindness to the suffer- ing of the manifestly or officially sentient as well. Joyce scatters bracelets throughout the text, for example, often giving them voices that resonate</page><page sequence="13">304 Elizabeth Inglesby with the voices of other objects, or timing their appearances in the novel at moments when he wants to emphasize a failure of seeing, hearing, or understanding of the Other on the part of one of the characters.14 In "Nestor," for example, Stephen unsympathetically observes his "welloff" students and imagines their lust for seaside girls; the image that springs to Stephen's mind is of "tittering bracelets" on the arms of young girls "engaged in struggle" (24-25). Meeting his sister at the bookstall, he conjures a memory of her listening to his tales of Paris, "fingering a pinch- beck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token" (243). His thoughts fly first to her hard- ship, and he is wracked with guilt. However, as she morphs, in his mind, into the "lank coils of seaweed" he earlier consigned to romantic metaphor at the water's edge in "Proteus," Stephen's empathy once again deserts him. He thinks chiefly of self-preservation as he regards Dilly's misery. When the bracelets reappear in "Circe" on the limbs of the "night hours," they speak with the voices of "dull bells" (471), manifesting weariness and echoing both the "Heigho!" of the harness bells on the tired horses that Bloom regards empathetically in "Hades" (70) and the "loud dark iron" bells of St. George's church that Stephen and Bloom hear in "Circe" and "Ithaca" (471, 704). The bracelets add their voices to the chorus of things that speak in Ulysses with only a limited chance of being heard or understood. The ashplant itself reappears dozens of times in the novel, fulfilling its role, as Stephen sees it, of faithful accessory to his wardrobe and occa- sionally handy tool or weapon. It also participates in the text as a member of a class of objects whom Joyce encourages us to view as independently communicative, both vocally and gesturally.15 In subtle ways, Stephen's walking stick, the canes gripped by the blind stripling and by the spec- tre of Rudy, who appears at the end of "Circe," and even the ubiquitous umbrellas of Ulysses - carried by various characters, used as a "sceptre" (470) and a "marquee" (568) in "Circe," or cluttering Bloom's hallstand four abreast (68) - speak of another dimension of the story of Ulysses . They point, tap, clack, and squeal alongside the talkative characters, emphasiz- ing what the human element in the novel misses, revealing ironies in its disregard for the phenomenal world, and witnessing with their constant presence to the multimodal possibilities for sentience or awareness, even when they remain mute. As Stephen makes his way through "Wandering Rocks," he carries on a fragmented conversation with himself that touches on his earlier concerns in "Proteus" about whether or not the world continues to exist "without" him when he closes his eyes: The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing</page><page sequence="14">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 305 of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher, were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. (242) Joyce encloses this moment of Stephen's contemplation of the two worlds - "real" and "ideal," after Richard Henry Stoddard, or "dead" and "powerless to be born," after Matthew Arnold (Gifford and Seidman 276) - between two communications from the material world. The leath- ern bands and dynamos speak, and Stephen hears in them a call to action: "be on." He takes their urgings to mean that he should get moving down the street, but they seem also to suggest, successfully, that Stephen turn "on" active contemplation of his earlier consideration of the world outside himself. His appraisal of machines as "beingless beings" seems shallowly paradoxical and dismissive, as if finding an oxymoronic way of expressing their essence constitutes a sufficient understanding of their existence, in Stephen's mind. As he ponders how to respond to being caught between two worlds, his sentences become choppier and syntactically awkward, though revealing: "Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shat- ter them, one and both" makes "I" a towering, stick-like figure between the chaos that engenders a sense of helplessness in the first phrase and the action that decisively destroys chaotic motion in the second. Although Stephen fears stunning himself as he thinks of taking action, he seems to desire a resolution of the questions of the nature of reality that nag him throughout the book. "Shatter me you who can" is a taunt or challenge directed at any force that can demonstrate to him his place among the phe- nomena he encounters and thinks about. In the next moment, his ashplant handle taps him on the shoulder, clacking against him as if in response to his challenge as he makes his way down the street.16 Stephen, however, remains oblivious, distracted by a print in the window of a shop. Not until "Circe" does the ashplant get to become a version of the "I" in the sentence above, an agent of the action foreshadowed in Stephen's syntax. When Stephen uses his ashplant to smash the gas lamp and bring on the last leap of "time's living final flame" and the "ruin of all space" (583), "one and both" shatter two dimensions hitherto crucial to delineat- ing the realm of the material as separate from the ethereal, philosophical, and spiritual. After this climactic moment, Stephen "abandons his ash- plant" (583), then complains of having "displaced" his "centre of gravity" (589). Bloom - whom Molly calls "an old stick in the mud" in this episode (440) - picks up the ashplant and spends the rest of the episode trying to restore it to Stephen's reluctant grasp, a feat he is only able to accomplish as "Circe" fades with the image of Rudy holding a "slim ivory cane" (609). "Eumaeus" begins with Bloom picking Stephen up, dusting him off, and</page><page sequence="15">306 Elizabeth Inglesby attempting to bring him back in touch with the material needs of his body. Thereafter, images of the ashplant, with its iron ferrule and its resonating counterparts, the grasses, sticks, and bracelets, continue to haunt the nar- rative as a constituency with a voice intended for the audience's hearing, if not for that of the characters. Joyce also uses Stephen's linguistic dexterity to introduce another physical and etymological signpost in Ulysses , one that complements the objects that speak in "Telemachus." In "Nestor," Stephen entertains and puzzles his students with a joke that brings together the subject they are studying, history, with a Dublin landmark and a suggestion of cheap sexu- ality to be found at the seaside. Stephen asks: Wait. You, Armstrong, Do you know anything about Pyrrhus? . . . - Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier. . . . - Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book, what is a pier. - A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the waves. A kind of bridge. Kingstown pier, sir. . . . - Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge. The words troubled their gaze. (25) In this exchange, which he imagines reenacting later in order to amuse Haines, Stephen introduces the pier, or "disappointed bridge," as a meta- phor for disconnection - for a failure to communicate between two spheres of existence. This image generates Stephen's musings on the nature of the real, and of the "actuality of the possible as possible" (25), a line of thought he will unfurl more fully in "Proteus" as he attempts to grapple with Aristotelian definitions of reality. He considers how history might have unfolded differently, thinking of all the potential manifestations of being that have been cut off from us because they have not been actualized: Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a bedlam's hand or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death? They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibili- ties they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that the only possible which came to pass? . . . Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms. (25-26) Stephen's instinctive tendency is to think of what might have been (but was not) as though it had material presence: a class of things that must be "ousted," or removed, bodily, from the "room" in which they are stored,</page><page sequence="16">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 307 in order to make way for what is.17 If so, where do the phenomena of pos- sibility go when they are usurped by the "real/' or actual? Stephen cannot hold for long in his mind the weighty image of potential; he reverts to abstractions, such as "thought is the thought of thought" and "soul is the form of forms," in order to sidestep the question of where the "soul" actu- ally resides or what comprises it. He does not seem to want to consider the possibility that if human bodies are the containers of the soul, then other "bodies" might also be capable of possessing "spiritual" content. When he reaches this impasse in his thoughts, it is as though he has come to the end of a philosophical pier and stopped, seeing no way to progress further in his inquiry into the actual and the possible. Interestingly, the last thought that he has before coming up with his clever pier joke is of the sound of the seaside girls' "bracelets tittering in the struggle" to fend off the aggressive attention of the schoolboys in his class. Gifford and Seidman note that Stephen's thoughts, after they lead from "Pyrrhus" and "pier" to the more esoteric "possibilities" and the soul as a "form," echo "another of Aristotle's distinctions, that between poetry and history in The Poetics " (31). If Joyce, as Gifford and Seidman argue, is mak- ing use of the philosopher's assertion that "the poet's function is to describe, not the thing that has happened, but a kind of thing that might happen" and that "the distinction between historian and poet" is that "the one describes the thing that has been and the other a kind of thing that might be," then this particular way of envisioning the poet's (or novelist's) task helps to illuminate one of the ways in which Joyce himself sees possibilities for rei- magining the definition of the soul and its relationship to the material body. Joyce considers not only what might have been, had humanity behaved dif- ferently in the past, but what might be if people were to reconsider their relationships with the physical world. In Ulysses , he sets out to furnish a room with normally ousted possibilities of communion with the inanimate. The room belongs not to Stephen, however, but to Bloom; Joyce waits until "Ithaca" to make it materialize fully as a location in which recognition of the object world as a peer becomes "a kind of thing that might be." Stephen inaugurates Joyce's play upon "pier" and the homonym it brings to mind, "peer," a linguistic connection the author will use to sug- gest new ways of attempting to see beyond both the human and the in- dividual point of view. It is Bloom, however, whom Joyce uses to model potential ways of bridging the gap between ourselves and the objects around us. In conjunction with Bloom's various attempts to pierce the veil ostensibly separating him from the rest of the phenomenal world, Joyce reveals, in Bloom's pierglass, an inanimate world that actively returns the human gaze. In doing so, Joyce suggests the possibility that we might move toward spanning the gulf between mind and matter by changing the ways in which we regard the latter.</page><page sequence="17">308 Elizabeth Inglesby A Reappointed Bridge: Bloom's Pierglass and the Returned Gaze of "That Other World" Although Stephen has declared that vision, or "thought through my eyes," will enable him to see into the nature of reality, Joyce suggests that perhaps his failure to listen to the voices of the phenomenal limits his comprehen- sion of the material realm. Bloom, whose story begins in the fourth epi- sode, at first seems to hold some promise of clarifying the flaws in vision that Stephen has introduced, as the older man appears to be more inter- ested in gaining knowledge through sensory experience than in finding the literary correlative for what he observes. Yet Joyce uses Bloom not as a corrective to Stephen's point of view, but as a different medium for further- ing the narrative of the nonhuman. Bloom often nudges us toward con- templation of the inanimate, even if his own thoughts about it frequently remain underdeveloped. We are privy to Bloom's mental observations as he navigates Dublin, tasting, smelling, and feeling it as well as looking at and listening to it. If we depend upon Bloom to help make sense of Joyce's treatment of matter, we encounter a man who appears more open than Stephen to the possibility that things, like animals, may have intrin- sic value beyond their usefulness to humanity, and may perhaps even have knowledge, agency, or power, despite their silence and stillness. He wonders what nonhuman entities, such as the hearse-pulling horses of "Hades" or the items on his mantelpiece, might be capable of in the way of thought or sensation and recognizes some of the barriers that conspire to keep him from experiencing overt communion with them. Bloom keeps alive a spirit of inquiry into their nature rather than always automatically appropriating them for use as extensions or reflectors of the self. Bloom's observations of the material world are colored by his fears and desires, even if his thoughts are generally less literary than those of his younger counterpart, Stephen. Bloom's underdetermined regard for the phenomenal, however, functions as a more useful model for the process of bringing to light the complexities inherent in any attempt to see be- yond ourselves, particularly when we must rely heavily upon language to express what we discover there. Bloom's sometimes bumbling efforts to apprehend the nature of his physical surroundings, in many respects, represent Joyce's recognition that no true articulation of what lies outside the mind is possible; Bloom's imaginative, empathetic attempts to enlarge the confines of his perspective, however, may reward him with some par- tial truth concerning his place in the empirical realm and may deepen his sense of the indivisibility of mind and the matter that comprises and shapes it. Re-envisioning as a means of achieving some understanding gets another trial once Bloom, with his sharper eyesight and less textually clut- tered mind, enters the novel and begins to peer into the murky depths of the world outside of himself. Through Bloom's interactions with his</page><page sequence="18">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 309 surroundings, Joyce establishes that an inclusive viewpoint, one that incorporates consideration of perspectives other than human ones, can enlarge one's humanity and illuminate hitherto neglected aspects of the material. Of the two protagonists, Bloom comes closer to achieving the overall vision that Joyce champions in the novel, of a world teeming with vitality and intelligent presence. From the beginning of "Calypso," when we first encounter Bloom, he is trying to communicate with the nonhuman, talking and listening to his cat and attempting to guess at her desires and motivations. He de- cides that animal powers of perception are underrated: "They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to" (55). 18 His interest extends beyond the family pet, though, as he also contemplates in "Lotus-Eaters" the lives of carriage horses: He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaken reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jug- ginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed alright and their doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wag- ging limp between their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they look. (77) Bloom acknowledges, through his tentative language, that his ideas about the inner lives of beasts are guesses at best, but guesses based on his ob- servations of the visible, material circumstances of their lives. Although he mentions "[t]heir Eldorado," as if to say that they have aspirations beyond the simple satisfaction of their desire to eat, he seems to feel little urge to turn the horses into metaphors for human suffering or to situate them in the pantheon of famous horses of literature or art; instead, he tries, as best he can, to approximate their perspective. Bloom also considers the horses that pull the heavy wagons loaded with coffins and granite for the grave markers, wondering whether they have any sensitivity to the human sorrow that attends their occupation: "Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it with his plume skeoways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing against a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day?" (101). Bloom tries to imagine what the horses experience in their toil, right down to the pressure that the weight of their harnesses exerts on their bodies, but he ultimately admits that he does not know the extent of their knowledge of their own suffering or of ours. He leaves room for the possibility that the animals' experience might be similar to our own, rather than presuming to know what they can or cannot perceive.</page><page sequence="19">310 Elizabeth Inglesby Bloom's openness to the idea that other beings could be capable of registering sensation and understanding makes it possible for him to in- clude vegetation as well, as he does in "Lotus-Eaters" when he thinks of "Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness" (71). He contemplates the custom of communicating one's thoughts or inten- tions to another by sending bouquets made up of flowers with certain symbolic meanings: "Language of flowers. They like it because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down" (78). "They," in this case, probably refers to women, as Bloom is carrying on a light epistolary ro- mance under the pseudonym "Henry Flower." Joyce's language, however, suggests that we also consider the possibility that the flowers can speak a language among themselves and that "no-one can hear" the private com- munications that they share. Part of what fuels Bloom's willingness to see other life-forms as sen- tient is his vaguely formulated understanding of metempsychosis, or the passing or transmigration of souls from one body to another. Bloom's vari- ous graveyard reveries during the "Hades" episode demonstrate that he does not draw clear distinctions between what the living and dead bodies are capable of experiencing or registering. He pictures the hearse spilling Paddy Dignam's corpse out into the road and sees his face: "Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now" (98). Bloom also antici- pates a visit to a pub on the return trip from the cemetery: "Expect we'll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consola- tion. Elixir of life" (98). Both of these thoughts indicate Bloom's reluctance to separate completely the dead man's "soul" or personality from his ma- terial body. Bloom figures that characteristics normally associated with personality, rather than corporeality, may pass from one material form to another: Holy fields. More room if you buried them standing. Sitting or kneel- ing you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it, too, trim grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mt. Jerome. Well so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life ... Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living. Changing about. Live forever practically. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves. (108-9) The passage at first seems to suggest that Bloom views corpses primarily as a kind of logistical problem to be solved: how to inter them most ef- ficiently? how to keep them from debouching above ground after burial?</page><page sequence="20">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 311 His practical side has led him to think of the hearts of the dead as "old rusty pumps" "lying around" the graveyard like so many useless spare machine parts (105), an image that resonates with Stephen's idea of ma- chines as "beingless beings." Yet his notion that the "sleeping" bodies of graveyard tenants make the best narcotics once they metamorphose into poppies shows that he senses that character traits might adhere to "cells" as they change forms. At the center of the novel, in "Nausicca," we find Bloom walking alone on the beach after his encounter with Gerty MacDowell, ruminating on sexuality, suffering, and death, as he has done throughout the day. His sympathies extend to a wide range of entities, allowing him to consider the perspectives of and motivations driving bats, bees, birds, sailors at sea, and lightship operators. He ponders metempsychosis once again, thinking of grieving people turning into weeping willows, and even wonders, "Do fish get seasick?" (379). When he looks down at the sand, objects strewn along the shore arrest his attention and interrupt his reverie: Mr. Bloom stopped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go. Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with a story of a treasure in it thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Chil- dren always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's this? Bit of stick. (381) Readers may recognize this scene as a companion to or perhaps even a parody of Stephen's attempt to "read" the "signatures of all things, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, blue- silver, limits of the diaphane" (37). Unlike Stephen's, however, Bloom's seaside confrontation with physical reality begins with an admission of the difficulty of reading even those "texts" that have been written by hu- man hands, in a language he ostensibly understands. As he stands "peer- ing" at the items ranged before him, he faces not only his own fear of personal obliteration, but also the near-inscrutability of the material realm, which seems to contain messages that Bloom is uncertain how to interpret: Mr. Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What? I. Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides, they don't know. What is the meaning of that other world.</page><page sequence="21">312 Elizabeth Inglesby AM. A. No room. Let it go. (381) The passage relays Bloom's fears and uncertainties about who or what he is, symbolized by his unfinished sentence ostensibly addressed to Gerty, scrawled in the sand, but abandoned as he finds that he has "no room" to complete his declaration of selfhood. His expansive consideration of so many perspectives and possible modes of being have left him unable, perhaps, to reduce himself to a few succinct words. He is left wondering about the meaning of "that other world," an echo of Martha Clifford's dislike of Bloom's bawdy language, but also an invitation to consider himself as part of a phenomenal world that is "large" and "contains mul- titudes," as Whitman claimed of himself. Bloom's fear that anything he writes will be erased reiterates Stephen's certainty that his friends will trample the wavering line that his ashplant left on the path in the morn- ing. Significantly, however, Bloom imagines that Gerty might still be able to discern his face in the tidal pool, a "dark mirror" that may continue to reflect his current sense of immersion in the sensory world. The image he imagines there anticipates the moments in "Ithaca" when Bloom and Stephen will see themselves reflected in one another's faces and Bloom will gaze at objects reflected in his pierglass and feel a connection with them beyond ownership. Bloom's understanding that inert matter may house some form of vitality also has interesting implications in "Circe," in which Bloom and Stephen encounter the terror and wonder of speaking objects, such as a button, a gasjet, soap, yews, and bracelets, to name a few. Though the episode is often characterized as "hallucination" and treated as though it represented a complete, irrational departure from conceivable reality,19 Joyce's translation, into English or near-English, of the voices of the inani- mate may also be read as a less subtle version of the narrative that things have voiced all along in the novel. In "Circe," Joyce asks us to imagine what it would be like to be privy to the thoughts or perspectives of the things around us, and demonstrates through a series of dizzying exchanges how inadequate to the task of taking it all in the human mind would likely be. The episode seems to ask how much "response-ability" the characters are capable of summoning when faced with a version of reality in which all things are potentially sentient, watching and judging human behavior. Reading the episode as an external expression of conscience - Bloom's guilt or shame over the secrets, lusts, and other failings he harbors, or per- haps Stephen's remorse for his uncharitable behavior toward his friends and family - is a commonplace of "Circe" criticism, and plenty of evidence may be found to support such interpretations. Joyce's inclusion of speak- ing inanimate objects in the moral arena of the chapter, however, compii-</page><page sequence="22">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 313 cates such interpretations by introducing things that appear to have the same, or nearly the same, status as the characters to whom Bloom and Stephen feel bound to answer for their "sins." Some of these objects, such as the Nymph from the picture in Bloom's bedroom, or Bella Cohen's fan, are closely associated with both a particular character and a certain part of his or her psyche. This association, however, does not make talking inani- mate items into mere hallucinations. Instead, the vocal presence of these more "familiar" objects simply helps to reveal the power of narcissism to influence what we choose to focus on in our environments. Things that seemingly possess human qualities or seem to reflect our images back to us, like the nymph, receive more sustained attention from the characters than objects whose utterances are more cryptic, such as the gasjet that exclaims "Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!" (510), the bicycle bells that warn Bloom to "Haltyaltyaltyall" (435), or the sandstrewer's gong that cries out "Bang Bang Bia Bäk Blud Bugg Boo" (435).20 When the Nymph initially approaches Bloom, she appears to have been summoned by his weeping confession: "My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff . . ." (544). She "descends" from her "oaken frame," speaking "kindly" to him, but also betraying her origins as a picture from Photo Bits by quoting advertisements from the magazine (545). At first, she seems likely to be purely a product of his imagination, as she tells him frankly of what she has "seen in that chamber," his bedroom; she hints that she has witnessed scenes of lust and depravity that make her blush as she recalls them, and his responses corroborate her recollections. Bloom is by turns apologetic and full of excuses for his behavior. However, when she suddenly dons a nun's white habit and tells Bloom, "No more desire . . . Only the ethereal" (552), he resists, telling her "coldly," "You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only the ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices?" (553). His response represents his unwillingness to see all that is transpiring before him as simply a figment of his mind, or a bodiless transaction between her image and his own memories of what the nymph might have witnessed. Bloom's button, though it has only one line, "Bip!" (552), as it snaps off of his trousers, plays a role in breaking the "spell" of "Circe" that Bloom feels he has been under during most of the episode. Like Stephen's ashplant in "Telemachus," the button speaks up as if to as- sert the primacy of the actual over the ethereal, helping Bloom to stand up to the nymph, who exits the scene with "her plaster cracking" in mockery of her refusal to acknowledge her materiality. Other objects, such as the waterfall (547, 549, 552) and the church bells (471) seem to have only a distant connection with any specific person. Therefore, they can more easily dodge categorization as the products, or familiars, of any particular character's mind. Although the characters hear them elsewhere in Ulysses , the bells are linked most closely with the</page><page sequence="23">314 Elizabeth Inglesby bracelets who share their utterance of "Heigho! Heigho!" in "Circe." The cry going up from both bell and bracelets steers us back to the voices of objects in "Telemachus," who call to the reader and go unnoticed by the characters. Joyce includes such items as if to ask what consideration we would feel we owed to such seemingly tangential objects if they had the ability to communicate their thoughts to us in language we could more readily understand. In Nighttown, these talking things momentarily be- come "peers" with potential claims on characters' consciences, rather than mere props or inert possessions of their human counterparts. Instead of enabling inanimate objects to speak for the first time, the narrative rules at play in "Circe" briefly make their voices more insistent and easily intelli- gible to the characters and the audience. The episode represents Joyce's at- tempt to smash a barrier similar to the idea of the "fourth wall" separating actors from the audience in a dramatic performance. In the case of Circe, however, the fourth wall is the barrier between characters and props (and perhaps even costumes): despite the outlandish quality of the episode, Joyce demands that we recognize the profound ways in which objects and places impinge upon consciousness, and the ways in which language, a property that all things possess in "Circe," makes that process possible. In "Ithaca," Joyce pulls us back from the theatrics of "Circe" in or- der to allow us to take stock of the impact they have made on Bloom's and Stephen's understanding of their relationships to the phenomenal. Bloom returns to the relative quiet and calm of his own home, accompa- nied by Stephen, who stays for conversation but declines to spend the night. Just before he leaves, Stephen and Bloom share two experiences that Joyce links with the story of the inanimate world that Ulysses has been telling. One is a moment in which Stephen and Bloom both hear the bells of St. George's church ringing as they are shaking hands at the end of the night. The narrative voice asks, "What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?" The text answers, "By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet. lubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat. [Italicized in original] By Bloom: Heigho , Heigho , Heigho , Heigho " [Italicized in original] (704). Joyce offers the audience a reminder not only of Stephen's grief for his mother and Bloom's compassion for the carriage horses whose harness bells he heard earlier in the day, but also of the bracelets that reverberate in "Circe" and their relationship with the ferrule, or mouthpiece, of Stephen's ash- plant. As in "Telemachus," Stephen hears thoughts: he registers nothing resembling bell sounds, but rather, the text that might accompany them. Bloom, at least, hears the voice that Joyce gives to bracelets and bells, even if it carries personal associations for him. The other post-"Circe" connection that Joyce creates among Stephen, Bloom, and the world of objects occurs when both characters are "[sjilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of</page><page sequence="24">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 315 theirhisnothis fellowfaces" (702). The significance of their gazing at one another appears to reside in the narrator's choice of possessive adjectives to reveal what they see in each other's faces: commonality in "their"; and individuality and recognition of separation in "hisnothis," or perhaps, if we read the word fragment as "his - no, this," a cryptic acknowledgment of similarity of features that doubles the sense of their connection as "fel- lowfaces." 21 The moment of "reciprocal" recognition between two obvi- ously sentient and intelligent beings acts as a precedent for Bloom's next encounter with a mirror, in which his confrontation with the objects on his mantel "mirrors," in some revealing ways, the moment with Stephen.22 When Bloom reenters his house after Stephen's departure, he stumbles over the newly rearranged furniture that Molly has moved, or that Boylan has moved for her during their afternoon together. Bloom's collision with the "walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily ar- rested his ingress)" (705) brings his focus sharply to the material things that occupy the room. He notices two pieces of furniture in particular: One: a squat stuffed easy chair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discoloura- tion. The other, a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush. (706) The two chairs, with their attitudes and attributes reminiscent of physi- cal qualities of Molly and Boylan, seem clearly intended as anthropomor- phized symbols of the betrayal that has taken place in the house earlier that day. The language of the passage self-consciously alludes to the topic that Bloom has obsessively dwelt upon and avoided all day, and thus manages to suggest that Bloom's encounter with the chairs as chairs has been eclipsed by his vision of them as representative of his unfaithful wife and her lover. Yet moments later, Bloom disengages from his wounded feelings long enough to consider other items in the room - even things reflected in mir- rors - without turning them wholly into symbols or reflections of his own sorrow or jealousy. Characteristically, Joyce leads us toward this vision with a play on words: the similarity of "pier" and "peer" expands into a play of ideas about the existence of a spiritual dimension in the mate- rial universe. Bloom, peering into the glass, is able to regard himself as an object among objects, a feat that Joyce suggests through his use of a "gilt- bordered pierglass" as a lens through which Bloom can view himself and even his wedding presents with equanimity:23</page><page sequence="25">316 Elizabeth Inglesby What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece? A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4:46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl: mat- rimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper. What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom? In the mirror of the gilt-bordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless com- passionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle. (707) The exchange of looks taking place between Bloom and two of the wedding gifts, the dwarf tree and the embalmed owl, ties together, in one small moment, several threads of a theme running throughout Ulysses : the extension of sympathies and consideration toward beings - animals, plants, and inanimate objects that we are unaccustomed to including fully in our sphere of concern - as a means of exploring another realm of the "possible," or as Aristotle might put it, "what might be."24 Joyce shows the embalmed owl (reminiscent of both the corpses in the cemetery and the animals that Bloom has studied during the day) returning to Bloom, with its wise and melancholy gaze, some of the compassion he has shown for others. The exchange is not a simple mirror reflection, however, but a transfer of the compassion of the owl's gaze from Bloom (whose gaze is, more passively, "compassionated" by this encounter, a reminder of Stephen's "epiphanised" ballast clock) to the dwarf tree (reminiscent of the disregarded plant life in the novel, like the "leader shoots"), which in turn looks at the back of the owl, completing a circle of regard that sug- gests mutuality, rather than difference, among the gazing objects. Bloom sees his "peers" in the objects reflected in the glass as clearly as he has seen a "fellowface" in Stephen. The metaphor of the "disappointed bridge" that fails to connect two worlds dissolves once Joyce reshapes it into the pier- glass, in which the pier, meeting its own reflection, completes itself in the glass as a bridge between consciousness and the concrete. A "Hubbub of Phenomenon": Unearthing the Buried Voices of Ulysses Examples of objects asserting themselves separately from characters serve as Joyce's attempts to picture a world in which such activity could be</page><page sequence="26">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 317 occurring constantly, just beyond the periphery of our awareness. He asks us to consider what epistemological adjustments would be necessary in order to accommodate such a realization, and how it would alter our con- ceptions of the human place in the material world. The goal of such at- tempts is to sift through the layers of a complex and indivisible matrix of mental activity and material presence, turning objects over to expose the potential richness of their existence. Joyce recognizes the interdependency of our minds, our surround- ings, and the language we use to describe the world we register and ex- perience. He demonstrates the reciprocity of this arrangement through a variety of forms of animation involving allusion, linguistic continuities between entities, the use of one object's voice as a reinforcement for an- other, and repetition and evolution of the appearance of certain kinds of objects over the course of the novel. Ulysses reminds us that we cannot see without the presence of the seen, a world of overwhelming and of- ten indecipherable complexity, and that we cannot describe what we see without relying upon the organizing forces of a language larger and more powerful than any individual self. Given our inescapable reliance upon this material and linguistic matrix, Joyce envisions moving beyond view- ing objects as props in our drama in order to demonstrate that the histori- cally hierarchical relationship between the human and the nonhuman is largely a construction of language, as it transforms sense data into the raw material of philosophy. The novel breaks new ground by encapsulating a world in which all elements can potentially command equal attention. Though objects may seem to "speak" most obstreperously in "Circe," they are never completely silent anywhere in Joyce's world. The narrative of the material and the menial in Ulysses is a long, fragmented, and partially obscured one that depends heavily on the recurrence of certain kinds of objects and the connections that language establishes between them to help it surface. This story is not the kind that leaps out at the person experiencing Ulysses for the first time, but rather, one that comes to light through a process akin to archeology, in which the reader must attempt to draw conclusions about Joyce's regard for the material based upon a large catalogue of objects that often appear, as do artifacts lying in the soil, without interpreters to offer ready explanations for their significance. The muffled voices of these items do, however, find ways to make themselves heard in the text, as Joyce consistently offers his audience opportunities to experience them that are not necessarily available or apparent to the characters. Ultimately, Joyce's concept of the function of trivial detail diverges considerably from Stephen's early ex- planation of the "epiphanised" object as the special creature of individual human consciousness. The author's reworked definition of epiphany ap- pears to be far more complex and subtle, moving beyond simply display- ing objects that seem ripe for his characters' particular regard. The author</page><page sequence="27">318 Elizabeth Inglesby provides sites in the text where a kind of epiphany can occur for the readers of Ulysses , yet often understates these opportunities to such an extent that they seem to be, in their nascent state, more possibilities than necessities in a full encounter with the text. However, the presence of objects that "speak," no matter how quietly, of a living world beyond the confines of individual consciousness is fundamental to Joyce's expansive vision of the novel as a potentially limitless framework for conveying not only the human experi- ence, but also the material matrix in which all existence is embedded. University ofMontevallo Montevallo, Alabama NOTES 1. Bill Brown takes the process that Stephen is attempting to elucidate in a differ- ent direction in his discussion of the way in which objects confound their observ- ers, achieving "thingness" when "they stop working for us" and slip out of the roles normally assigned to them as possessions or commodities ("Thing Theory" 4). Lisa Flueťs "Stupidity Tries: Objects, Things, and James Joyce's 'Clay'" refer- ences Brown's assertion and credits him with "identifying] literary criticism with the responsibility to retell the history of the material world as a kind of upward mobility story; literature chronicles how objects abandon their alienated, reduc- tive identifications with function, value, and commodity status and 'attain' the status of things. In addition, literature chronicles how modernity routinely works to impede this narrative of advancement" (206). These ideas bolster my sense that Joyce deliberately creates independent roles in Ulysses for things that are signifi- cant apart from their associations with characters. 2. Critics such as Robert Spoo, Patrick McGee, Hugh Kenner, and Richard Ellmann, to name a few, have devoted considerable attention to the different ap- proaches that Stephen, Bloom, and various other characters take to reading their surroundings. They point out, for example, that Stephen experiences the world with less bodily gusto and more self-conscious philosophical and literary over- lay than Bloom does, and that the novel offers a multiplicity of angles from which to view any character or situation that it encompasses. Much of the critical focus, however, remains on the characters themselves, rather than the actual objects they encounter. A few notable exceptions occur in the work of Garry Leonard, Jennifer Wicke, and Thomas Richards, all of whom tackle one important aspect of the empirically commonplace, studying the role that objects as commodities play in Ulysses. Along with John Gordon, whose Joyce and Reality: The Empirical Strikes Back also addresses the way in which Joyce crafts the material world of the novel, these critics stay resolutely fixed on the primacy of character consciousness as both the arbiter of encounters with the phenomenal and the genesis of the multiplicity of styles in the novel. Others, such as Steven Connor, focus more narrowly on the talking objects in "Circe," as these things are particularly difficult to dismiss once Joyce gives them the ability to speak English or near-English. He breaks the chorus of voices of the inanimate that fill "Circe" into categories of ventriloquy, which he</page><page sequence="28">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 319 designates as "more appropriate than hallucination to name the dominant tech- nique of the chapter" (101). That these voices are, ultimately, extensions of the characters' psyches, however, remains an underlying assumption of Connor's ar- gument as well that of Douglas Mao, who makes a similar assessment of Joyce in a chapter on Wyndham Lewis in Solid Objects. Connor begins by entertaining the idea that Joyce wants us to be alert to the possibility that objects, not just char- acters, have a narrative to express: "Up to the beginning of 'Circe,' there have been a number of hints in Ulysses about the desirability of a language enlarged to include the non-linguistic world of nature or matter, not just as a symbol, but in self-announcing utterance" (93). He cites the example of Stephen urinating into the ocean while giving "words to the sounds of [the] rushing and sucking of the sea," and concludes that "it is important at this moment that Stephen learns to surren- der himself to voices outside himself, learns not just to write the world, but also to 'read the signatures of all things'" (93). His next comment, however, sweeps aside the idea of surrender to "outside" voices, taking the argument back toward a view of the inanimate world as a collection of inert forms waiting for a character to come along to enliven them with his imagination: "Stephen animates the world of nature by giving it voice, breathing its breath, in a blending of utterance that parallels and is enacted through the mingling of human with marine saline substance" (94). Mao seems to agree: "Taking their cue from Flaubert, James and Joyce cram their fictions with solid objects, but since these objects come explicitly mediated through particular consciousnesses, the total effect of their works (themselves insufficiently firm of outline) will be to undermine the solidity of the perceived world as surely as Pater's Heraclitean paroxysms undo our chances of capturing that which melts before us, or Russell's form of attending to the wallpaper promotes its demateri- alization" (107). What Mao overlooks in Joyce, however, is that the novelist offers us multiple views, over the course of multiple episodes, of many of the objects he includes in Ulysses. Joyce, thereby, often precludes the problem of displaying a given object as little more than the "product" of a "particular consciousness." He also finds ways to allow objects to speak for themselves, without depending upon human voices to convey their utterances to the audience. 3. Sustained critical attention to Whitman's presence in Ulysses seems surpris- ingly sparse, though the poet receives at least a brief mention as one of Joyce's literary influences in many of the works I consulted while writing this essay. Donald Summerhayes examines Joyce's allusions to Whitman in "Joyce's Ulysses and Whitman's 'Self': A Query," an eight-page article published in Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature in 1963; Richard Ellmann, in a discussion of Joyce's treatment of Aristotelian idealism and materialism in the novel, asserts that "[t]he law of contradiction, which, Stephen declares, underlies all Aristotle's psy- chology, and which in turn underlies the first three episodes of Ulysses , prevents 'man' and 'not-man' from being the same thing. On the basis of such distinctions the non-subjective, external world can be built up in unchangeable thereness. Mulligan's lumping together of human and animal, of Irishism and Irish syco- phancy, of cruelty and kindness, are failures to acknowledge the law of contradic- tion. As he says, quoting Whitman: 'Do I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict myself'" ("Ulysses" on the Liffey 17). This reading of Whitman's lines provides a justification for their appearance in the text at this moment, and also underscores</page><page sequence="29">320 Elizabeth Inglesby Stephen's blindness to the dynamism of the external world he assumes is non- subjective and unchangeable. Buck, in violating the "laws of contradiction" that Stephen "follows faithfully enough in the first three episodes" (Ellmann 17) seems to echo Whitman's tendency to lump together all sorts of people, animals, objects, and landscapes in order to express the contradictory "multitudes" that make up a self. Buck's rough way of treating his clothes, Stephen, and the "leader shoots" he "club[s] with his heavy bathtowel" ( Ulysses 17) makes at least playful reference to their potential or actual sentience. James Maddox also briefly discusses allusions to Whitman in both "Telemachus" and "Scylla and Charybdis" (Joyce's "Ulysses" and the Assault upon Character 111), and Richard Finneran explains the connections between Whitman's "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and Joyce's cryp- tic phrase, "The word known to all men," which appears in several episodes of Ulysses ("That word known to all men' in Ulysses : A Reconsideration"). 4. The poet enters the matrix of allusion and observation at the ground level, and his influence lingers throughout Joyce's tale of the phenomenal world, reso- nating particularly in images of grass, reeds, fronds, and sticks that Joyce includes liberally throughout Ulysses , beginning with their unusual debut in 'Telemachus." 5. The change, in the Paris text of 1922, from a passive construction, "up- reared," to the more dynamic and forceful "leader shoots," with its rebellious and feisty connotations, represents Joyce's desire to increase, incrementally, the sense throughout the novel that the nonhuman world, even when sitting still, is vital, rather than utterly inert or lifeless. 6. Whitman's famous image from "Song of Myself" of the grass as "the beautiful uncut hair of graves" suggests that his fondness for this symbol stems not merely from its clear connection to significant sites of human memorial but also from its usefulness as a symbol of the ordinary, small-scale, ubiquitous entity that we can easily dismiss as the stuff of "background." Whitman calls attention to it, promis- ing, 'Tenderly I will use you, curling grass," acknowledging that "the smallest sprout shows there really is no death" (25), and asking the grass, "If you do not say anything, how can I say anything?" (67). Joyce adapts this kind of inclusive regard for the minute and mundane to suggest that there really is no thing in Ulysses inca- pable of finding a voice, even if willing auditors are harder to come by. 7. Sara Crangle, in her insightful discussion of the role of Stephen s ashplant in Ulysses ("Stephen's Handles"), points out that Stephen sees it as "a tangible source of authority"; a "spirit or demon in association with a human being" and one "[imbued] with a spectral eternality"; a "sword"; and "a physical handle that de- livers [him] from incertitude, as well as a harbinger of death," all ideas that spring from its association with him in particular (62). She also notes, however, that "its implicit power prompts Buck to tug at it in a gesture of farewell," a statement that suggests the possibility that the ashplant may have some sense of agency of its own. This idea finds support earlier in the article when Crangle asserts that "Joyce increasingly [prioritizes] the machinations and experiences of the physical world over those of the mental one" and that "tactile, sensual experience takes prece- dence over theoretical grappling" (52), though she stops short of discussing what powers, if any, the ashplant has independent of its connection with Stephen. She also affirms that Bloom's approach to the phenomenal world is markedly different from Stephen's: "Bloom insists upon miring himself in tangible particularities nei- ther certain nor transcendent; in this, he forms an ideal counter to Stephen, whose</page><page sequence="30">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 321 more academic desire to grasp all continually results in a very dead certainty, from his earliest interests in names and nouns to his recurrent exploration of epiphanies and epiphanic theory" (65). 8. Sheldon Brivic, in The Veil of Signs , points out that in Joyce, "the reality of words is seen when they are seen changing. They alternate between the clearness we grasp and the unclearness we slip into so that their 'band and disband' revolves into and out of consciousness . . . most of the looping of signification involving Joyce's characters connects them to other characters to whom they are not speak- ing, to inanimate objects, to ideas, and to something outside their known, con- scious worlds" (2-3). In the case of the ferrule, the link between it and the plants that Buck has been thrashing happens with scarcely any relationship to charac- ter at all. The "changing language" is almost entirely responsible for creating the connection. 9. The blind stripling, "Penrose," with his tapping cane, will resurface through- out Ulysses as a reminder of this failure of vision among some of the sighted mem- bers of Joyce's cast. 10. Patrick McGee argues, in Paperspace: Style as Ideology in Joyce's "Ulysses," that Stephen's use of texts is a way of "constructing] a disguise" in the form of a "classical subject from which his discourse seems to originate," and that "Stephen does not perceive the world unmediated, for the living subject is grounded in the dead - those other subjects, those texts, which feed into Stephen's discourse, which read Stephen even as he reads the world . . . Stephen does not read passively; he writes in an act that subordinates the speaking subject to its process, its work" (18). McGee's position helps to underscore the extent to which Stephen's "readings" of the "signatures of all things" are for him primarily ex- ercises in defining himself as a subject rather than seeing the objects he reads as separate entities, or even "texts" themselves. 11. An interesting irony resides in the line from St. Ambrose's Commentary on Romans , which notes, "For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now"; this line implies a kinship in suffering among all the components of creation, and fosters the idea of a rough equality among them (qtd. in Gifford and Seidman 64). 12. Hugh Kenner reads this passage as an example of the way in which, in "Proteus," "all melts into Stephen's mind and into words. There is no coupling of name to thing; there is, rather, a swerving approximation of two experiences, one sensual, one textual, as of hyperbola and asymptote"; to the sensual experience, however, Kenner gives short shrift. He writes that "[t]hings have voices also" in the passage, but neglects to elucidate them further except to say that the "fine Latin cadence" of Ambrose's words" "says what [leaves and waves] try to say," (40) a conclusion that simply reinforces the idea that "things," in fact, do not "have voices also." 13. Joyce even included a "St. Ferréol" in the list of saints he added to "Cyclops" in the Paris text. The New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia mentions St. Ferréol of Uzés, who died in 581. Fr. Landelin Robling, Order of Saint Benedict, asserts that "the rule of St. Ferréol, written in the sixth century, regards transcription as the equiva- lent of manual labor since it charges that the monk 'who does not turn up the earth with the plow ought to write the parchment with his fingers.'" JewishEncyclopedia .com reports that "Ferréol, Bishop of Uzès, converted [the Jews] by living in familiar</page><page sequence="31">322 Elizabeth Inglesby intercourse with them. Having been severely rebuked for this by Childebert, Ferréol ordered the Jews of his diocese to meet in the Church of St. Theodoric, and preached to them a baptismal sermon. Some Jews abjured their faith; he forbade the others to remain in the city, and expelled them from his diocese." His rele- vance to Ulysses , other than the resonance of his name with the ferrule of Stephen's ashplant, lies in the conversation that Bloom and Stephen have in "Eumaeus," in which Bloom reassures Stephen that "literary labour" is "important work" and that Stephen is "entitled to recoup [himself] and command [his] price" (644-45); St. Ferréol may also remind the reader of Bloom's status as a "converted" Jew who nevertheless wanders the city, feeling, at times, like an exile or a disregarded entity - particularly after facing the Citizen in "Cyclops." 14. The "bracelet of bright hair about the bone" in John Donne's "The Relic" offers an interesting counterpart to Joyce's use of bracelets to draw attention to cognitive failure on the part of his characters. Donne's speaker calls his bracelet a "device" for uniting lovers in death and explains that it "might be some way/ To make their souls, at the last busy day, / Meet at this grave, and make a little stay" ( Selected Poetry 122). Donne's speaker wonders whether or not anyone opening his grave will understand the bracelet as an object that unifies separated souls. Joyce, on the other hand, uses bracelets to set up echoes in the text of related ideas and to underscore his characters' inability to unify resonances between certain sounds and sights, a task he expects the reader to perform. 15. Stephen discusses the universality of a language of gesture in Circe (432), but without specific reference to his ashplant as a speaker of it. 16. Joyce added this detail to the Paris text of 1922. 17. Stephen's thought process resonates with Woolf 's ambition, in To the Lighthouse and Jacob's Room , to raise the specter of an empty room or house that, paradoxically, contains limitless epistemological fodder. The room that Stephen describes holds, essentially, an emptiness as well, because the possibilities it houses never came to pass. 18. Bloom later revisits this idea after encountering the "blind stripling" in "Lestrygonians"; he realizes that many people treat the blind as though they were stupid, too, or not fully human. This realization causes him to confront prevail- ing attitudes toward those who are lacking in certain faculties and to uncover the "blindness" of the sighted when faced with uncommon modes of perception, such as reading Braille or navigating by sense of smell and hearing: "Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or we are sur- prised when they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person or a hunch- back clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more . . . Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being born that way?" (181-82). Bloom's observations underscore some of the limitations of conventional thinking that get in the way of a more nuanced consideration of the capacities of other beings. For more on Bloom and the stripling, see '"O, despise not my youth!': Senses, Sympathy, and an Intimate Aesthetics in Ulysses ," by Siân E. White. 19. Daniel Ferrer refers to "Circe" as "both a magic lantern, producing phan- tasies whose function is to consolidate the Self, by concealing reality or filling in its flaws, without ever mingling with it, and an infernal machine which destroys</page><page sequence="32">The Speech of Unheard Things in Ulysses 323 identities and shatters reality" (130). The episode can also function, however, as a way of bringing elements of the reality that lies outside the human mind into dialogue with one another and the "Self" that Ferrer implies would like to avoid having full contact with reality. Hugh Kenner asserts that "the 'hallucinations' ex- ist almost wholly for us. We, if not Bloom, see many strange things in this long episode, though it is not always clear what we may be seeing because the style is misleadingly homogenous" ( Ulysses 121). If we have been reading all along with an eye for the active voice and participation of the phenomenal in the narrative, the hallucinatory effect engendered by the presence of talking objects, at least, might not seem so extreme in "Circe." 20. Joyce reiterates this distinction in "Ithaca," when Bloom receives "consola- tion" from the "candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk" (710). 21. Marilyn French, in Book as World: James Joyce's "Ulysses," explains the differ- ing sounds that Bloom and Stephen hear in the bells as Joyce's way of establish- ing that they have "returned to their own modes of perception, into their own flesh" after "reaching separate but consubstantial unity" by contemplating each other's faces (230-31). She asserts that "most of the points on which the two men make contact are comically trivial" and that "the significance of these moments of rapport is not something we can estimate," but decides that these encounters in "Ithaca" demonstrate an "underlying unity of mankind" established in "Circe" by "show[ing] us two very different human beings warily and tentatively perceiving that unity and interrelatedness" (232). Joyce also uses the encounter, however, to bring back into focus the voices of things that we have heard elsewhere and to underscore their echoing presence even as the text ostensibly follows the actions of the characters. 22. The mirroring encounter between the older and younger man also recalls a moment from "Nestor" in which Stephen, while helping Sargent with his sums, ruminates on "Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and move- ment, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a dark- ness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend." Stephen then recognizes in Sargent his own younger self, "these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness" (28). 23. This moment, which culminates in the "equanimity" Bloom feels, near the end of "Ithaca," toward his wife's infidelity (731-33), shares the "pier /peer" con- nection with one of his earlier ruminations on promiscuity, in which he thinks of the pier with lamps, summer evening, band, Those girls , those girls , / Those lovely seaside girls Milly too. Young kisses, the first. Far away now past. Mrs. Marion. Read- ing lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding. A soft qualm regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips. Will happen, too. (67) This reverie makes Bloom think of himself, Boylan, Milly, and Molly as "peers" in the arena of sexual desire. Bloom recognizes that all of them will feel and act</page><page sequence="33">324 Elizabeth Inglesby upon lustful urges, and to struggle against desire or compete against others for dominance in the sexual game is "useless." Their need for fulfillment connects all of them across moral and physical boundaries. These thoughts also connect Bloom with Stephen, who thinks of the "twittering bracelets" on the girls' arms, as noted above. 24. Note that Joyce excludes the clock from this exchange of regard. Perhaps it is too redolent of Stephen's theory of epiphany from Stephen Hero , in which the Ballast Of- fice clock must depend upon Stephen to decide whether or not it has "epiphanised."
