<plain_text><page sequence="1">Intralist and extralist sources of distinctiveness and the bizarreness effect: The importance of contrast JAMES B. WORTHEN AND PHILIP H. MARSHALL Texas Tech University The roles played by intralist and extralist distinctiveness with respect to the recall of bizarre and common sentences was investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, a greater percentage of bizarre than common sentences was accessed in predominantly common lists and in lists containing equal numbers of common and bizarre items. Reciprocally, a greater percentage of common than bizarre sentences was accessed in predominantly bizarre lists. In Experi- ment 2, contrast (i.e., the degree of separation between common and bizarre sentence types) was manipulated. In high-contrast lists, intralist distinctiveness was more powerful than extralist distinctiveness associated with bizarreness. The opposite was true for low-contrast lists. The results support an extension of the distinctiveness hypothesis to include the independent effects of intralist and extralist distinctiveness and suggest related limiting conditions. In recent years, much of the research investigating bizarre mnemonics has been guided by explanations and hypotheses that incorporate the distinctiveness construct. McDaniel and Einstein (1986), who provided the first formal extension of the distinctiveness account to bizarreness research, have suggested that distinctiveness may be at the heart of the bizarreness effect. In their review of the previous literature, McDaniel and Einstein found that investigators that have found bizarreness to be an effective memory aid have usually incorporated the use of a within- list design. Those that have used a between-list design tended not to find the significant effect. Thus, when subjects are presented with bizarre and common items within the same list, results indicate a mnemonic advan- tage for the bizarre items. In their study, McDaniel and Einstein hypoth- esized that, in a mixed list, the bizarre items are made distinct by the presence of the common items and are, therefore, better recalled. To support their distinctiveness hypothesis, they demonstrated a mnemonic benefit for bizarre sentences accessed when subjects were presented with lists containing equal numbers of common and bizarre sentences. Also in support of the distinctiveness hypothesis, Einstein, McDaniel, and Lackey (1989) showed that when subjects were presented with unmixed AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">WORTHEN AND MARSHALL lists followed by interfering material, the nature of the interfering ma- terial differentially affected the recall and access of target sentences. If subjects were given an unmixed list comprised of bizarre items, their subsequent recall of those bizarre items was increased if the interfer- ing materials consisted of common items. Einstein et al. argued that the list of common interfering items could be thought of as providing a context in which the bizarre target items become distinct and, thus, better recalled. Recent research has defined distinctiveness in both absolute and rel- ative terms (Einstein &amp; McDaniel, 1987; McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 1991). In absolute terms, bizarre items are inherently distinct relative to oth- er items stored in memory. However, distinctiveness also varies relative to other items within a specific learning situation. For example, McDaniel and Einstein (1991) reported that bizarre items are rated as more bizarre when presented in lists containing bizarre and common items than when presented in purely bizarre lists. In keeping with this dual notion of distinctiveness, we address distinc- tiveness in terms of the proportion of common to bizarre items within a specific list and in terms of an individual's probable total memory history. As such, we identify two potential sources of distinctiveness. Intralist (or within-list) proportional distinctiveness exists when a given item type is in the numerical minority within a specific list; extralist pro- portional distinctiveness exists when a given item type is in the numer- ical minority relative to one's previous experience and stored knowl- edge. Previously stored knowledge is important with regard to extralist distinctiveness because it is likely to contain categories of information that may be accessed for purposes of comparison and contrast. This conceptualization of distinctiveness allows us to make several specific hypotheses regarding the distinctiveness function in relation to the bizarreness effect. First, if distinctiveness underlies the facilitative effects of bizarreness on memory, then the percentage of bizarre sen- tences accessed should increase as the ratio of common to bizarre sen- tences increases. We hypothesize that as the proportion of common sentences is increased within a mixed list of common and bizarre sen- tences, the bizarre sentences will become more proportionally distinct within the list and this distinctiveness will lead to enhanced recall. Second, if distinctiveness (rather than bizarreness) is the critical vari- able underlying the bizarreness effect, intralist distinctiveness should function symmetrically. That is, if distinctiveness is responsible for the mnemonic effects, we should also expect an increase in the percentage of common sentences accessed as the ratio of bizarre to common sen- tences is increased within a list. Thus, we would expect to find a mne- monic advantage for either sentence type that is proportionally distinct (in the numerical minority) within a given list. 240</page><page sequence="3">DISTINCTIVENESS AND CONTRAST It must be noted that comparisons to another item type are necessary for distinctiveness effects to occur. That is, the failure to obtain a bizarre- ness effect using unmixed lists (e.g., McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 1986) does not necessarily dispute the existence of extralist distinctiveness. In an unmixed list, only one item type exists within the list. As a result, the likelihood that another specific category of information will be access- ed for comparison is decreased relative to the mixed list case. Thus, distinctiveness effects are not as likely to occur in unmixed lists because the situation does not promote access of (and thus comparison and contrast with) other specific categories of information. If, however, another imagery type is introduced as intervening material, a basis for comparison is provided and distinctiveness effects may be found (e.g., Einstein et al., 1989). Although the majority of previous research using mixed lists has in- volved equal numbers of common and bizarre items, the few studies that have manipulated the proportion of items within lists (and thus intral- ist distinctiveness) appear to indicate that the effects of intralist distinc- tiveness are as powerful as the effects of extralist distinctiveness. Kroll and Tu (1988, Experiment 5) presented subjects with lists containing predominantly common, predominantly bizarre, or equal numbers of bizarre and common sentences (50/50 list). Results indicated no signifi- cant differences between common and bizarre items in terms of recall or sentences accessed in the predominantly bizarre and 50/50 lists, but a significant advantage in recall and access of bizarre material in the predominantly common lists. Although Kroll and Tu (1988) made no reference to the sources of distinctiveness described above in their interpretation, the results can be explained in terms of extralist and intralist sources of distinctiveness. In the predominantly common list (where the bizarreness effect was obtained), the bizarre items have the advantage of both extralist and intralist distinctiveness. The lack of a significant effect in the 50/50 and predominantly bizarre lists suggests that extralist distinctiveness is not necessarily more powerful than intralist distinctiveness. In the predom- inantly bizarre list, the extralist advantage of the bizarre items is com- peting against the intralist advantage of the common items, and thus significant effects are less likely to be obtained. In the 50/50 list, no intralist distinctiveness exists, but the bizarre items have the advantage of extralist distinctiveness. Kroll and Tu's data indicate that extralist distinctiveness was not sufficient to allow for a recall or access advan- tage. It must be noted, however, that the lack of a significant difference in Kroll and Tu's 50/50 list is at odds with previous research. The ma- jority of researchers using equal numbers of bizarre and common items within lists has reported a bizarre recall advantage (e.g., McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 1986, 1991; Pra Baldi, De Beni, Cornoldi, &amp; Cavedon, 1985). 241</page><page sequence="4">WORTHEN AND MARSHALL Hirshman, Whelley, and Palij (1989, Experiment 1) presented sub- jects with predominantly common and predominantly bizarre lists and found significantly greater recall for bizarre sentences in the predomi- nantly common than in the predominantly bizarre lists. Although com- parisons between common and bizarre recall within each of the lists were not made, the mean recall for common sentences in the predom- inantly bizarre list was slightly, but most likely nonsignificantly, higher than the recall for bizarre sentences. In keeping with the intralist dis- tinctiveness explanation, the opposite was found in the predominantly common list. Sharpe and Markham (1992) reported a study in which they varied the proportions of items within lists and found that recall of bizarre sentences increased as the proportion of common to bizarre sentences within each list increased. That is, as a greater number of common sen- tences were included in the lists, the percentage of bizarre sentences recalled increased. However, Sharpe and Markham did not make the comparisons that we feel are necessary to clearly delineate the role of intralist and extralist sources of distinctiveness. For example, there were no item recall or sentence access comparisons between sentence types within any of the list compositions. Thus, without within-list compari- sons, we are unable to determine the relative recall advantage or dis- advantage of each sentence type within each specific list composition. EXPERIMENT 1 Experiment 1 was designed to provide a direct test of an expanded proportional distinctiveness hypothesis, including an examination of extralist and intralist sources of distinctiveness. Subjects were present- ed with either a list consisting of 50% common sentences and 50% bi- zarre sentences, 75% common sentences and 25% bizarre sentences, or 75% bizarre sentences and 25% common sentences. In the 75% com- mon condition, our prediction was that a greater percentage of bizarre than common sentences would be recalled because the bizarre sentenc- es have the advantage of both intralist and extralist distinctiveness. In the 75% bizarre condition, the extralist and intralist sources of distinc- tiveness are in direct competition. In this case, the bizarre sentences have an extralist advantage, whereas the common sentences have an intralist advantage. Given the results of previous research (Hirshman, et al., 1989; Kroll &amp; Tu, 1988; Sharpe &amp; Markham, 1992), we expect the common items to be equivalently or better recalled than the bizarre items. In the 50/50 list, only extralist distinctiveness will be active be- cause neither imagery type is in the numerical minority within the list. 242</page><page sequence="5">DISTINCTIVENESS AND CONTRAST Again, based on the majority of previous research, we expect a recall advantage for the bizarre items in this condition. METHOD Subjects Ninety introductory psychology students (approximately equal numbers of men and women) participated for extra course credit. Subjects were tested individ- ually and experimental sessions lasted approximately 15 min. Design and materials Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to each of three groups that differed in terms of the composition of the list presented: 50% common and 50% bi- zarre sentences, 75% common and 25% bizarre sentences, or 75% bizarre and 25% common sentences. The 20 sentences making up each list were drawn from the set of stimulus materials used by McDaniel and Einstein (1986). Each sentence contained three nouns typed in all capital letters. The relationship of the nouns within each sentence was manipulated to provide a common and bizarre version of each sentence. For example, the common version of the word triplet banker, newspaper, and puddle would be "The BANKER dropped the NEWS- PAPER in the PUDDLE," and the bizarre version would be "The BANKER floated across the PUDDLE on a NEWSPAPER." Two list versions were con- structed for each list type and randomly assigned to subjects.1 Within each list, sentence type (bizarre or common) was assigned randomly to each sentence to provide the necessary ratio of common to bizarre items. Thus, sentence type was varied within subjects, and list version and list composition were varied between subjects in this 2 x 2 x 3 mixed factorial design. Each sentence ap- peared in the middle of a computer monitor, and the order of presentation of the sentences was completely randomized. Procedure Each subject was seated in front of a monitor and a keyboard. After each subject had read the instructions presented on the computer screen, the ex- perimenter repeated the instructions verbally. To ensure an incidental learn- ing, image-generating situation as in McDaniel and Einstein (1986), each sub- ject was told that the purpose of the experiment was to measure individual differences in imaging ability. For each sentence, subjects were told to form an interactive mental image of each sentence and then to rate the vividness of their image on a 5-point scale by pressing a number on the keyboard. The vividness rating served to further emphasize the importance of making an image. Each sentence was presented for 8.5 s, but subjects were encouraged to rate the sen- tence at any time during the 8.5-s interval. After 5 s, the sentence "You have three seconds to make a rating" appeared on the screen below the target sen- tence. Subjects received five practice trials to familiarize themselves with the time constraint. During these practice trials, each subject was presented with 243</page><page sequence="6">a row of X's instead of sentences so as to control for any interfering material that might change the proportion of common to bizarre items. After imaging and rating each sentence, each subject was given a 2-min distractor task con- sisting of math problems to minimize the possibility of recency effects. After these 2 min, each subject had 4 min to recall, in any order, all of the words that were typed in all capital letters from all of the previously presented sentences. Subjects used the computer keyboard to type their responses. RESULTS Recall was analyzed for the percentage of nouns recalled and the percentage of sentences accessed for each sentence type. Although plu- ral versions of target nouns were accepted, synonyms or related words were not accepted. The percentage of target nouns recalled in each condition is shown in Figure 1. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the percentage of target nouns recalled indicated no significant main effects of sentence type, F(1, 84) = 1.64, p &gt; .20; list composition, F(2, 84) = 2.38, p &gt; .05; or list version F(1, 84) = .93, p &gt; .30. However, a signifi- cant interaction was found between list composition and sentence type, F(2, 84) = 5.14, MSE = .0148, p &lt; .01, and a significant three-way inter- action was found between list version, list composition, and sentence type, F(2, 84) = 3.82, MSE= .0148, p &lt; .05. To further examine these interactions, an analysis of simple effects was conducted. In the 75% common condition, bizarre target nouns were recalled significantly better (M= 32.8) than common target nouns (M= 22.9), F(1, 28) = 8.13, MSE= .0179, p&lt; .01. Although the percent- age of bizarre target nouns recalled was greater than the recall of com- mon target nouns for both list versions, the bizarre recall advantage reached significance for only one list version in this condition; for List Version 1, F&lt; 1, and for List Version 2, F(1, 14) = 16.56, MSE= .0160, p &lt; .005. No significant effects were found regarding target nouns recalled in the 50/50 condition [all Fs &lt; 1 with the exception of the nonsignificant effect of list version, F(1, 28) = 2.92, p &gt; .05]. In the 75% bizarre condi- tion, neither list version, (F&lt; 1); sentence type F(1, 28) = 1.94, p &gt; .15; nor the interaction between sentence type and list version, F(1, 28) = 1.06, p &gt; .30, reached significance. The percentage of sentences accessed in each condition is shown in Figure 2. The analysis of the percentage of sentences accessed indicat- ed a significant main effect of list composition, F(2, 84) = 4.98, MSE = .0233, p &lt; .01; a significant main effect of sentence type, F(1, 84) = 9.03, MSE = .0267, p &lt; .005; a significant two-way interaction between list composition and sentence type, F(2, 84) = 12.50, MSE= .0267, p&lt; .0001; 244 WORTHEN AND MARSHALL</page><page sequence="7">DISTINCTIVENESS AND CONTRAST 34 32- 30- 28- 26- 24- 22-" -0- ---0 50/50 75% Common 75% Bizarre 20 Common Bizarre Sentence Type Figure 1.

C n 246 j V</page><page sequence="9">DISTINCTIVENESS AND CONTRAST Between-lists analyses of target nouns recalled and sentences access- ed for each sentence type were conducted using the Tukey procedure. These analyses indicated that, for bizarre sentences, recall (in terms of both target nouns recalled and sentences accessed) was significantly greater in the 75% common condition compared with the 50/50 and 75% bizarre conditions (p &lt; .05 for both). No significant differences in recall were found for common sentences between lists. DISCUSSION In general, the results provided support for several aspects of the proportional distinctiveness hypothesis. The recall and sentence access advantage of the bizarre sentences in the 75% common condition sug- gests that when extralist and intralist sources of distinctiveness are ap- plied to the same sentence type, memory for sentences of that type is greatly enhanced. The results of the 75% bizarre condition, where extralist and intral- ist sources of distinctiveness work in opposition, were as predicted. The common recall and sentence access advantage in the predominantly bizarre list suggests that the effects of intralist distinctiveness may be stronger than the effects of any extralist distinctiveness associated with bizarreness. This finding contrasts with previous research which has not been able to demonstrate an advantage for common sentences within predominantly bizarre lists (Hirshman et al., 1988). The lack of significant differences between bizarre and common sen- tence types in the 50/50 list may suggest that the effects of extralist distinctiveness are relatively weaker than intralist effects. In this condi- tion, the equal numbers of common and bizarre sentences obviated any intralist distinctiveness, but the bizarre sentences could still have had an extralist distinctiveness advantage. However, despite the fact that the results from this condition are in keeping with the findings of Kroll and Tu (1988) and Sharpe and Markham (1992, Experiment 2), the exist- ence of a bizarre advantage with this type of list composition (50/50) has been consistently demonstrated elsewhere in the literature (e.g., McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 1986, 1991; Pra Baldi et al., 1985). Finally, although the sentences used in this experiment were drawn from those used by McDaniel and Einstein (1986) and have been fre- quently used in previous research (e.g., Hirshman et al., 1989; Kroll &amp; Tu, 1988; Sharpe &amp; Markham, 1992), our analysis of list version indi- cated significant differences between versions in the 75% common con- dition. Although this would normally be considered a nuisance effect, this fortuitous finding (as shown below) may be explained by variations in the relative bizarreness and commonness of the stimulus materials 247</page><page sequence="10">in the two list versions. Several researchers (Cornoldi, Cavedon, De Beni, &amp; Pra Baldi, 1988; Wollen &amp; Margres, 1987) have argued that many of the conflicting outcomes in the area of bizarre mnemonics may be explained by the inability to operationalize bizarreness properly and consistently. Similarly, and in keeping with the spirit of this argument, a post hoc examination of the bizarreness/commonness ratings (gath- ered from 20 independent subjects) of the sentences used in each list version of each of the three list compositions used in Experiment 1 in- dicated significant differences [75% common, t(19) = 2.11, p &lt;.05; 50/ 50, t(19) = 6.81, p &lt;.001; and 75% bizarre, t(19) = 2.99, p &lt; .01] between the ratings of the bizarre sentences. Specifically, with regard to the 75% common condition (where a list version effect on recall occurred), the mean bizarreness rating for the bizarre sentences in the list version demonstrating the significant recall and access advantage (3.98 on a 5- point scale) was significantly higher than the version which did not demonstrate a statistically significant recall or access effect (3.68). On the other hand, the mean ratings for the common sentences were es- sentially equal (1.57 vs. 1.63). Thus, there was greater disparity, or con- trast, between the common and bizarre items in the list version that yielded the bizarre advantage. Although list version effects on recall were not found in the 75% bizarre or 50/50 conditions (despite the existence of significant differences between the bizarreness ratings), we felt that an investigation which controlled the degree of contrast be- tween item types was warranted. Thus, Experiment 2 was specifically de- signed to explore the effects of item type disparity by manipulating the contrast between sentence types within each list. EXPERIMENT 2 Distinctiveness effects may be dependent upon the relative contrast between sentence, imagery types, or both, within lists. That is, extralist and intralist sources of distinctiveness may influence memory only when the category boundary between the bizarre and common items in the list is clearly established. Evidence for this notion stems from a post hoc examination of the bizarreness ratings of the sentences used in Exper- iment 1. Based on these findings, we expected that distinctiveness whould be effective when the common and bizarre items are clearly distinguishable (i.e., in a high-contrast list), but not when the bound- ary between common and bizarre items is marginal or fuzzy (i.e., in a low-contrast list). Specifically, we expected a bizarre recall and sentence access advantage in the 75% common list because of the effects of ex- tralist and intralist distinctiveness, and a bizarre recall and access advan- tage in the 50/50 high contrast because of effective extralist distinctive- 248 WORTHEN AND MARSHALL</page><page sequence="11">DISTINCTIVENESS AND CONTRAST ness and an absence of intralist distinctiveness. We also expected a com- mon recall and access advantage in the 75% bizarre high-contrast list. No intralist proportional distinctiveness effects were expected in the low- contrast lists. The sources of distinctiveness active for each sentence type in each of the contrast conditions can be found in Tables 1 and 2. METHOD Subjects Ninety-six introductory psychology students (approximately equal numbers of men and women) participated for extra course credit. Subjects were tested individually and the experimental session lasted approximately 15 min. Table 1.

Within each of these conditions, subjects were randomly as- signed to one of three list compositions: 75% common sentences, 75% bizarre sentences, or equal numbers of bizarre and common sentences (50/50). Two list versions were constructed for each list type in each condition. Sentence type (bizarre or common) was varied within subjects, and contrast, list version, and list composition was varied between subjects in a 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 mixed factorial design. Bizarreness ratings for the common and bizarre versions of the McDaniel and Einstein (1986) sentences and for 30 newly generated common and bizarre sentences were collected. Twenty subjects received one of two lists containing equal numbers of common and bizarre sentences. Each list contained all of the word triplets to be normed, and sentence type varied within each list (i.e., a triplet that appeared in common sentence form in one list appeared in bizarre sentence form on the other). The dimension of bizarreness or unusualness to he rated was not constrained by the experimenter, and all sentences were rat- ed on a 5-point scale. Based on these ratings, high- and low-contrast lists were constructed. The high-contrast lists consisted of bizarre sentences that subjects rated high in bizarreness and common sentences that were rated high in com- monness. The low-contrast lists included bizarre sentences that these subjects rated as moderately bizarre and common sentences that they rated as moder- ately common. The resulting mean bizarreness ratings for each sentence type in each condition are shown in Table 3. Procedure The procedure for Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1 with the exception that subjects were allowed 5 min (rather than 4 min) to com- plete the recall task. This change was implemented to decrease the possibility that subjects' recall may be limited by the time given to type responses into the computer rather than limitations related to memory. Table 3.

An ANOVA of the percentage of target nouns recalled indicated only a significant main effect of sentence type, F(1, 84) = 6.15, MSE= .0151, p &lt; .02. This effect is explained by a general recall advan- tage for bizarre target nouns across list compositions (mean percent- age of bizarre recall = 26.5, mean percentage of common recall = 20.6). Significance was not reached for the effects of list composition, F(2, 84) = 1.84, p &gt; .15); list version, F(1, 84) = 1.61, p &gt; .20; the interaction be- tween list version and contrast, F(2, 84) = 1.61, p &gt; .20; and the interac- tion between list composition and sentence type, F(2, 84) = 1.99, p&gt; .10. Similarly, F&lt; 1 for the effects of contrast; the interactions between list type and list version; list version and contrast; and the higher order interactions between list composition, list version, and sentence type; and list composition, list version, contrast, and sentence type. An ANOVA of the percentage of sentences accessed indicated signifi- cant main effects of contrast, F (1, 84) = 7.71, MSE= .0042, p&lt; .01; sen- tence type, F(1, 84) = 9.95, MSE = .0273, p &lt; .005; a significant two-way interaction between list composition and sentence type, F(2, 84) = 3.39, MSE = .0273, p &lt; .05; and a significant three-way interaction between contrast, list composition, and sentence type, F(2, 84) = 5.34, MSE = .0273, p &lt; .01. The effects of list composition, F(2, 84) = 1.54, p &gt; .20; list version, F(1, 84) = 1.35, p &gt; .20; and the interaction between list composition and contrast, F(2, 84) = 1.66, p &gt; .15, did not reach signifi- cance. Similarly, F&lt; 1 for all other variables and interactions. Given the significant three-way interaction between contrast, list composition, and sentence type, an analysis of simple effects collapsed across list versions was conducted. Analysis of the high-contrast condition indicated no significant sim- ple main effect of list composition, F(2, 45) = 1.72, p &gt; .15, nor sentence type, F&lt; 1), but there was a significant simple interaction between list composition and sentence type, F(2, 45) = 9.08, MSE = .0244, p &lt; .001. Further analysis indicated that the percentage of bizarre sentences ac- cessed was significantly greater than the percentage of common sentenc- es accessed in the 75% common condition (access means 51.2 vs. 32.9), F(1, 15) = 10.99, MSE= .0244, p &lt; .005, and the 50/50 condition (ac- cess means 45.0 vs. 33.7), F(1, 15) = 5.45, MSE = .0186, p &lt; .05. The percentage of common sentences accessed was significantly greater than the percentage of bizarre sentences accessed in the 75% bizarre condi- tion (access means 41.9 vs. 28.5), F(1, 15) = 4.74, MSE= .0302, p &lt; .05.

A comparison of access means using the Tukey procedure indicated that a significantly greater percentage of bizarre sentences was accessed in the 75% common condition than in both the 75% bizarre and 50/50 conditions (p &lt; .05). Analysis of the low-contrast condition indicated a sentence access advantage for bizarre sentences across list compositions, F(1 ,45) = 7.71, MSE= .0290, p&lt; .01 (mean percentage of bizarre sentence access = 37.6; mean percentage of common sentence access = 28.0).

The finding of a common sentence access advantage in the 75% bi- zarre high-contrast condition indicates that the mnemonic advantage of intralist distinctiveness can be greater than the effects inherently associated with bizarreness (extralist distinctiveness). In a predominant- ly bizarre list, the extralist and intralist sources of distinctiveness work in opposition. The bizarre items have an extralist distinctiveness advan- tage, whereas the common items have an intralist distinctiveness advan- tage. The common advantage demonstrated here provides support for an extension of the distinctiveness hypothesis which includes the sym- metrical functioning of intralist proportional distinctiveness. That is, the results suggest that distinctiveness can affect common as well as bizarre items. The bizarre sentence access advantage in the 50/50 high-contrast condition does indicate, however, that extralist distinctiveness (in this case bizarreness) does have a significant impact on memory. In a list containing equal numbers of common and bizarre items (and thus void of intralist proportional distinctiveness), extralist distinctiveness effects can be isolated to some degree. The bizarre advantage found here and in previous research using 50/50 list compositions (e.g., McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 1986, 1991) suggests that bizarreness per se does have a signifi- cant, but limited, mnemonic advantage. In the 75% common high-contrast condition, the bizarre sentences have the advantage of both extralist and intralist sources of distinctive- ness and, as predicted, were more likely to be recalled than common sentences. More important, finding a greater percentage of bizarre sen-</page><page sequence="16">tences accessed in this condition compared with the 50/50 and 75% bizarre conditions rules out the possibility that the access advantage was due exclusively to extralist distinctiveness. This finding, in combination with the common recall advantage in the 75% bizarre condition, clear- ly demonstrates the independence of extralist and intralist sources of distinctiveness. Significant effects of list composition (intralist proportional distinc- tiveness) were found only in the high-contrast conditions. This suggests that intralist distinctiveness is effective only when the boundary between bizarre and common items is clearly established. In the high-contrast conditions, intralist comparisons were facilitated by the fact that the bizarre sentences were clearly bizarre and the common sentences were clearly common. As such, intralist distinctiveness becomes more salient than extralist distinctiveness. However, in the low-contrast condition, the fuzzy boundary between the sentence types may have made within-list comparisons less obvious or spontaneous. In this case, extralist distinc- tiveness is the only operative source of distinctiveness. This notion is supported by finding only a significant main effect of bizarreness on recall of target nouns and sentence access in the low-contrast condition. As mentioned, we assume that high-contrast lists have category bound- aries that are more clearly established than low-contrast lists. Structur- al comparisons between the low- and high- contrast sentence lists pro- vide support for this notion. Of the sentences rated highly bizarre (high contrast), 74% describe an object or animal engaged in some type of anthropomorphic action, whereas only 24% of the low-contrast bizarre sentences depict anthropomorphic scenes. On the one hand, given that no common sentences depict anthropomorphic action, the common and bizarre sentences in the high-contrast lists can be categorized into one of two relatively discrete categories. On the other hand, no distin- guishable rule exists (other than general bizarreness) with which to categorize common and bizarre sentences that make up low-contrast lists. It is of interest that the anthropomorphic rule for generating effec- tive bizarre materials has been noted in previous research. In a study of bizarre and common visual mediators, Marshall, Nau, and Chandler (1980) found that giving human or living features to nonhuman ani- mals or objects was the most mnemonically effective among single elab- orative operations. The differences found between the low- and high-contrast groups in this study may also explain why previous research has failed to find a common recall or sentence access advantage in a predominantly bizarre list (e.g., Hirshman et al., 1989; Kroll &amp; Tu, 1988). The results of the present study suggest that bizarre items have a mnemonic advantage in 254 WORTHEN AND MARSHALL</page><page sequence="17">DISTINCTIVENESS AND CONTRAST low-contrast lists. In high-contrast lists, however, the mnemonic advan- tage becomes a function of list composition. In predominantly bizarre high-contrast lists, common items enjoy a mnemonic advantage because of intralist distinctiveness which is enhanced by a well- established boundary between common and bizarre items. In situations or studies where contrast is not controlled, the mnemonic outcomes associated with high and low contrast will each be negated by the other and no differences between item types will be found. Finally, it must be noted that the results of this study are in accord with semantic (e.g., Imai &amp; Richman, 1991), imaginal (e.g., McDaniel &amp; Einstein, 1986, 1991; Wollen &amp; Margres, 1987), and expectation-vio- lation (Hirshman et al., 1989) explanations of the bizarreness effect. Although the experimental design of the present study does not allow for direct comparisons of the three competing explanations, the results of the high-contrast condition (Experiment 2) fit especially well with predictions of the expectation-violation explanation. Specifically, Hir- shman et al. suggest that because surprise responses habituate rapidly, the recall of bizarre sentences should diminish as the number of bizarre sentences is increased within list. The decreases in the percentage of nouns recalled and sentences accessed as the ratio of bizarre to com- mon items is increased within each high contrast list support this hy- pothesis. In conclusion, the results of the present research provide support for an extension of the distinctiveness hypothesis that includes the indepen- dent effects of intralist and extralist sources of distinctiveness. When the boundary between common and bizarre items is clearly established (high contrast), memory will be affected by the proportional configu- ration of item types within the list (intralist distinctiveness). When the boundary between item types is not well established (low contrast), memory is influenced mostly by extralist factors. Appendix.

Although all sentences of the minority sentence type were replaced for each list version of each list composition, there was some overlap among the sentences of the majority sentence type in the 75% common and the 75% bi- zarre conditions of both experiments. To test the effects of overlap, t tests were conducted comparing target nouns recalled and sentences accessed between the set of overlapping and replaced sentences. No significant differences were found for either dependent variable in any of the list compositions of either experiment (all ts &lt; 1).
