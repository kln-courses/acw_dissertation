<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mnemosyne, Vol. XXXIII, Fase. 1-2 NOTES ON THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES' BACCHAE*) BY W. J. VERDENIUS ?: ???. Not 'je parais* (R.), but ? have come'. For the perfective use of the present cf. 5 p??e???, il t???s?, and K.G., I, 135-7. See also below, on 42 t??te?, 44 d?d?s?. ?: ????. Not "perhaps" (D.) but certainly an etymology of ?????s??: cf. 27, 84, 466, 550, 859. Etymologies of proper names are especially prominent in Euripides' later plays: cf. Schmid, 540 ?. ?, 8?3 ?. ??, and ?. van Looy in Zetesis: Album amicorum E. de Strycker (Antwerp-Utrecht 1973), 345-66, espec. 353. For other etymologies in the Bacchae cf. 292-5 (d????? ? ????? ? ?????), 298-9 (???t?? ? ?a??a), 367? 5?8 (?e??e?? ? p?????), 5^6 (?????a?- ???? d?? ???a?e ?a????). Euripides puts much emphasis on Dionysus' descent from Zeus (Schmid, 659 n. 4), probably to accentuate his universal significance (Winnington-Ingram, 36). I : t??de. 'Here' : cf. 7 t?de, 20 t??de, 23 t?sde, 6o t?de, 2I2 8de, Barrett on Hipp. 12, K.G., I, 628-9, Schw., II, 210-1. 2: t??te?. The historic present is used with or, as in this case, without expressive force (praesens annalisticum) : cf. Schw., II, 272. R. and L. fail to distinguish this use from the perfective present at 42 t??te?. 3 : ?st?ap?f???. The translation 'carrying lightning' is suggested by fr. 312 ?st?ap?f??e?, but 'carried by lightning' (R., L.) seems to be more probable on account of S. O.K. 199-200 p??f???? ?st?apa?. *) The following observations expand and correct my notes on the Bacchae in Mnem. IV 15 (1962), 337-8. They form the beginning of a commentary on this play which I am preparing and which is intended to be a supplement to the editions by Gr?goire, Dodds, Roux, Lacroix, and to the notes added by Kirk to his translation. Abbreviations are explained at the end of the article.</page><page sequence="2">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE 4: ??e??a?. Properly 'having acquired by exchange' (LSJ All), hence 'having exchanged my divine figure for a human one*. There is no need to raise the question how this is to be reconciled with the anthropomorphism of the gods, as is done by R. 8: ???? te. Most editors read ???? without te, but there is no evident parallel for f???a as an internal object of t?f??e?a: smoke and flame are different things. Willink (221) defends ?d??? given by Plutarch, but the fire is smouldering rather than abundant (L. '?pais'). The MSS. reading ???? te has been rightly defended by C. Prato, Maia 9 (1957), ?-19, who discusses 19 passages, most of them from the later plays, where anapaests occur elsewhere than in the first foot. Similar deviations from the rule are to be found in Aeschylus (e.g. Prom. 680) and Sophocles (e.g. Phil. 491). For more examples cf. C. Prato, SIFC 33 (1961), 101-13. Willink objects that "the antithesis ???? /'??a? is awkward rather than desirable here", but it may be an allusion to the story that Semele was persuaded by Hera in disguise to ask Zeus to visit her in his true shape (Hyg. Fab. 167, 179). The corruption underlying Plutarch's testimony is similar to that at Suppl. 860 t? ???? (given by Polybius), where the MSS. have t?? ?????. 8: p????.

Cf. Suppl. 148 a??a s???e???, Io 987 ???e?? ?????, and ?.G., I, 262. 9: ?????. Not an apposition to f???a (R.) or to the whole sentence (D.), but rather to the internal object of ??sa? which has been left unexpressed. Cf. Wilamowitz on H.F. 59, Bruhn, ? 11, K.G., I, 284-5. Similarly 66 p????. For ????? used as an abstractum pro con- creto D. compares El. 1261 ?????. Cf. also Horn. A 214 ?????? e??e?a t?sde, Hes.

(not discussed by K.G. and Schw.) cf. ap????t??, ?a??ast??, and A. Tovar in Serta Turyniana (Urbana etc. 1974), 56-8. L. hesitates whether ??at?? belongs to p?d?? or to s????: it clearly belongs to p?d??, for ???at??? s???? is an explanatory apposition (cf. A. Suppl. 202 ??e??? e? ???? f????). 12 : ??t???de?. Wrongly explained by R. as 'hypallage' : ??t???e?- d?? is equivalent here to ??t???e?? 'full of grapes'. For weakening of the sense of suffixes cf. Schw., I, 426, 836. 13: d?. Introduces the explanation (specification) of ? ???. Cf. my note on Men. Epitr. 352, Mnem. IV 27 (1974), 32-3. 13: t???. R. and L. read t?? with the MSS., and Kannicht simi- larly keeps t?sde at Hel. 89. R. refers to Euripides' "go?t pour les formes rares ou insolites", but the feminine ??? seems to be an Alexandrian invention based on the plural ??a?: cf. S. fr. 601 and the v.l. a? at O.C. 58. It should also be remembered that the confusion of a and ?? is extremely common in minuscule script. 13: p??????s???. ?. rightly observes that "Athenian audiences seem to have been especially interested in details of foreign lands". Cf. W. Kranz, Stasimon (Berlin 1933), 79 ff., S. L. Greenwood, Geographical Allusion in Attic Tragedy (Diss. Chicago 1938), K. E. M?ller, Geschichte der antiken Ethnographie und ethnologischen Theoriebildung (Wiesbaden 1972), 148 ff. There is also a display of learning on the part of Euripides, who in some respects was a forerunner of the Alexandrians (cf. e.g. 102-4, I227_9&gt; I274)?</page><page sequence="4">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE ?6: e?da????a. The meaning 'rich' is based on the idea of security from adversity: cf. C. de Heer, ???a?, e?da????, d?????, e?t???? (Amsterdam 1968), 63 ff. ?. McDonald, Terms for Happiness in Euripides (G?ttingen 1978), 255, seems to me wrong in suggesting that Arabia ''seems to be in a right relation to Dionysus, and so its prosperity is also due to his divine favor": e?da????a denotes a natural quality just as ???????t??? and d?s?????. ?8: ????s??. Not 'mixed with non-Greeks' (G., L.), but 'all kinds of (similarly 1356). The word probably belongs both to ????s? and to ?a???????. 20 : p??t??. D. in his first edition read t??e? and connected p??t?? with ???e?sa? and ?atast?sa? ('only when ...'), but in such cases (e.g. Ar. Nub. 1171: see my note in Mnem. IV 6, 1953, 180) p??t?? stands close to the participle. In his second edition D. keeps ???e? and is inclined to accept Pierson's transposition of 20 after 22 and to read ????a (Chr.Pat.) in place of p????. R. argues that p???? may have the meaning of 'country' (cf. 58), but the preceding p??e?? points to 'town'. She is right, however, in keeping the transmitted order of the lines and in translating t??de by 'here' (see above, on 1 t??de) and p??t?? by 'for the first time' (cf. LSJ s.v. p??te??? ? III 3 d) : it is at Thebes that Dionysus for the first time arrives at a Greek town. Emendations such as e?ta??a p??t* ??????? ??????? ????a proposed by Willink (221-2) are unnecessary, S. Melchinger, Die Welt als Trag?die, II (Munich 1980), 231, thinks that t??de p??t?? is contradicted by 201 pat????? pa?ad????. That phrase, however, does not imply "dass der Kult des Gottes in Theben wohlbekannt ist" (at 272 Tiresias himself calls Dionysus a da???? ????), but refers to the general principle that a being manifesting supernatural power should be recognized as a god (as is rightly pointed out by R. on 203; cf. also her note on 893-6; D. unnecessarily assumes an anachronism). Melchinger's solution of the alleged contradiction, "dies alles ? Geburt, Tod und Wieder- kehr ? geschieht ganz offenbar, um immer wieder zu geschehen, als ein Mysterium", is without any foundation. 21: ???e?. It is misleading to say that this line "introduit une id?e nouvelle" (R.): it introduces the specification of what the coming of Dionysus both to Asia (16 ?pe????) and to Greece (20</page><page sequence="5">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES' BACCHAE ?????) meant. Accordingly, it is wrong to call 20 a doublet of 23, as is done by Willink (221), who is equally wrong in reading t??e? and in putting a full stop after ???t???. G. Hermann's suggestion (adopted by Oranje, 177 n. 93) that ???e? in the sense of 'there too' implies his intention to establish his rites in Greece is rather stretched. For the specifying use of ?a? cf. Thuc. VII 27, 4 ???e??? ?p??a???????, ?a? ?t? ??? ?t?., PI. Meno 70 a 5 e?d?????? ?sa? e? t??? ????s?? ?a? ??a??????t? and my note in Mnem. IV 17 (1964), 262; see also Mnem. IV 9 (1956), 249. Accordingly, not a full stop (R.), but a comma or a semi-colon should be put at the end of 20 (L. recommends a semi-colon in his commentary, but prints a full stop in his Greek text!). 21: ???e?sa?. R. rightly observes that Dionysus is the ?pa???? (140) of the Bacchic dance, but her translation 'apr?s avoir l?-bas dans? ma danse' is unsatisfactory, for one expects a more specific indication. I therefore prefer to connect te?et?? both with ???e?sa? and ?atast?sa?: cf. 482 pa? ??a???e?e? . . . ????a, LSJ II ?. For the construction ???e?sa? te?et??, wrongly called 'transitive' by R., see above, on 9 d????. The phrase ???e?sa? ?a? ?atast?sa? may be called a hendiadys: the establishment of the cult consists in the first performance of the dance. For the central place of the dance in the cult of Dionysus cf. R. Cantarella in Studi V. de Falco (Naples 1971), 124. 22: te?et??. Translations such as 'myst?res' (R.) and 'initiations' (L.; cf. LSJ 'mystic rites practised at initiation') are misleading, for the cult of Dionysus did not require a formal initiation. For te?et? 'performance of ritual acts' cf. C. Zijderveld, ?e?et? (Pur- merend 1934) ; see also D. on 73 te?et??. A different view has been defended by H. S. Versnel in Lampas 9 (1976), 32, who refers to 77 ?a?a????s??. The context shows, however, that the purification is brought about by partaking of the ??as??. 22: ???t???. R. comments: "le dieu devient 'manifeste' ? ses fid?les". But Dionysus wants to manifest himself to, and become recognized as a real god by, all men. 23 : d?. R. unnecessarily adopts ?e from 1 : apodotic d? may occur after a participle: cf. Hyps. fr. 60, 11 (where Bond wrongly calls the correction ?e "probably right"), K.G., II, 277, Denn., 181-2,</page><page sequence="6">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE and my note on Semon. 7, no, Mnem. IV 21 (1968), 154. In such cases d? is a weak form of d?: cf. M. Leumann, Kleine Schriften (Z?rich 1959), 229 ff.; see also C. J. Ruijgh, Autour de 'TE ?pique' (Amsterdam 1971), 646-8. L.'s suggestion that d? is "une simple reprise de la coordination marqu?e par ???e?" is obviously im- possible. It may be added that d? is also given by a Berlin papyrus published by W. Brashear in ZPE 19 (1975), 300-1. 23: t?sde. D. is inclined to accept Pierson's conjecture t?sde, and this form is now given by the Berlin papyrus mentioned in the preceding note. It is defended by R. Kassel in ZPE 21 (1976), 35, who argues that "man erwartet, zumal im Prolog, das Pronomen nicht bei dem geographischen Begriff, der den weiteren Raum be- zeichnet, sondern bei dem Ortsnamen, der den Schauplatz des Dramas angibt". This is correct, but such an indication has already been given by t??de at 20, and t?sde marks the contrast between ??e? (21 ) and ??? ??????d??. 24: ????????a. Not 'excite by Bacchic cries' (LSJ; similarly R. 'j'ai fait lever au moyen de G???????'), but ? have made them raise loud cries'. The causative force does not lie in ??a- (as is assumed by D. and R.), for this expresses the idea of 'upwards' implied in raising cries (cf. ??a????). The causative use of ??????? may be compared to that of ?t?p?? at 240 ; cf. also ???e?? (H.F. 686) and ?a??e?? (H.F. 966, Or. 411). 24: ????a?. This does not refer to the fact that "les pattes de la b?te sont nou?es sur la poitrine" (R.), for the meaning is 'put on', 'wrap round': cf. Tro. 1220 F????a p?p??? ?????at* ???pt? ?????, Hei. ?186 t? p?p???? ???a?a? ????? ?????; (see also LSJ A II 2). 24: ?????. R. wrongly thinks that this implies a personification of Thebes: names of countries or cities are often used to denote the inhabitants (K.G., I, 53). 25 : ?????. G. and L. rightly put a comma after this word. 26: e????. For ?? ??? 'it is not allowed' (not in LSJ) cf. e.g. Horn. ? 24, A. Ag. 342, S. El. 273, Eur. Med. 61, H.F. 41, 141, I.T. 1288, Ba. 673. For a similar use of ?? de? see my note on Men. Epitr. 43, Mnem. IV 27 (1974), 20. 27: ?????s??. L.'s translation 'affirmaient que je n'?tais pas</page><page sequence="7">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE Dionysos, fils de Zeus' is grammatically impossible. In addition the point at issue is not Dionysus' name, but his descent. 30: s?f?s?ata. Apposition to the unexpressed internal object ??af???? (see above, on 9 ?????). 3o: ???e?a. G. here and at 47 and 53 wrongly adopts Wecklein's e??e?a. The use of ???e?a as a preposition is attested by inscriptions from the 6th century on (Meisterhans-Schwyzer, Gramm, d. att. Inschr., 216 n. 1730). Conversely, we find ??e?a for ???e?a at H. Ven. 199. See further P. Monteil, La phrase relative en grec ancien (Paris 1963), 266-7. 31: ??e?a????t?. The meaning of ??- is not 'excessively' (G.), but 'aloud', 'publicly' (cf. ??a????, ??e????a?). D. translates 'they published gloatingly', but gloating is implied in the situation, not in the meaning of the verb. R. thinks that "les soeurs de S?m?l? se glorifient de leur perspicacit?", but the meaning is probably neutral: 'to proclaim emphatically' (cf. e.g. Pind. 0. 9, 38). 31: ??e?sat?. Not 'bely, falsify' (LSJ II), but 'invent' (LSJ I 3). 32: a?t??. D.: " 'those same sisters': their allegation that Semele was punished brought punishment on themselves" (similarly R. : " 'ces femmes-l?, qui niaient ma divinit?'. Elles vont apprendre ? leurs d?pens ce qu'il en est"). It is much simpler to contrast a?t?? ('themselves') with pa? t? ???? sp???a (35)? 32: ?? d????. Oranje (37) argues that this is such a serious encroachment on the social code that it means an act of war com- mitted by the god against Thebes. But (1) staying in home was an ideal held before women rather than a strict precept (cf. A. W. Gomme, Essays in Greek History and Literature, Oxford 1937, 96 ff.), and (2) Pentheus does not take offence at the fact that the women have left their houses, but at the idea that they use the Bacchic rites as a cloak for sexual debauchery (225, 354). It is true that the fact that all women have left the town (35) is rather abnormal, but it shows the power of the god rather than his aggres- siveness. 32: fst??sa. For the reference to delirium cf. M. G. Ciani, Boll. Ist. Fil. Padova 1 (1974), 73, 100. 33: ?a??a??. 'Fits of frenzy*. L. writes: "La notion de folie jouera un grand r?le dans toute l'action (est-ce que ce sont les Bacchantes</page><page sequence="8">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE qui sont folles, ou Penth?e? Ou bien y a-t-il deux folies, dont l'une est un d?lire sacr?, bienfait de la divinit?, l'autre une tare caus?e par une mal?diction divine?)". These questions are ill-posed: there is but one Bacchic ?a??a, but this state of mind is so unstable that it may turn as easily to peaceful joy as to brutal aggression (L. in his introduction, p. 13, rightly speaks of a "complexit? faite ? la fois de fr?n?sie farouche et de paisible s?r?nit?"). K. observes that "these Theban women are no ordinary bacchants; they are 'mad- dened' (32 f., 36) far beyond the normal degree of Dionysiac inspiration?which did not lead to the tearing apart of cattle or the ravaging of villages (735 ff., 751 ff.). The CHORUS, on the con- trary, are true bacchants, and the worship they long for, though it includes the eating of raw flesh, has little of the murderous, sinister, and antisocial excesses of the women of Thebes" (similarly Chromik, 243-4). This is true to some extent (for the unfavourable connota- tions of fst??sa and pa????p?? cf. 979, iooo, 1229), but it should be added that "as the play develops, their [the Chorus'] tone changes; they pray for vengeance with a dreadful concentration and gloat over the vengeance when it is achieved" (Winnington- Ingram, 11). On the other hand, the Theban women are a model of e???s??a (693) before they are disturbed (728 ff.). Both extremes, serenity and bestiality, are inspired by one and the same god, and Dionysus himself expresses the ambivalence of his power by calling himself 'most terrible and most gentle to men' (861). Grube (400) rightly remarks that "it is in the dual nature of the god, and there only, that we shall find the key to 'the riddle of the Bacchae' ". Cf. also H. Diller, Kleine Schriften (Munich 1971), 371: "Die dionysische Welt, die in dem Drama dargestellt wird, ist ein ein- heitlicher Komplex . . . gerade das buntschillernde Ineinander von wilder Ekstase und stillem Frieden ... ist charakteristisch f?r das dionysische Wesen". 33: d?. Has consecutive force: cf. H.F. 44, 711, Denn., 170, and my note in Mnem. IV 9 (1956), 248. 33: pa????p??. For the reference to delirium cf. M. G. Ciani, Boll. Ist. Fil. Padova 1 (1974), 75, 100. 33: f?e???. Neither locative (R.) nor separative (K.G., I, 401), but a genitive of limitation ('within the limits of, 'restricted to the</page><page sequence="9">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE field of). It is true that we find pa?a??pt??a? t???? 'to be cheated out of a thing' (LSJ II i), but Hipp. 238 pa?a??pte? f???a? is a closer parallel. For the genitive of limitation cf. Med. 647 ???t??tat?? ?????, A. Prom. 907 a???d?? f?e??? (where a??ad? f????? is to be rejected as a lectio facilior), Schw., II, 132. 34: ??e??. 'Wear': cf. 176, and LSJ A II 3. 34: ??????. Properly 'things done', as is pointed out by D. and R. See further Richardson on H. Dem. 273. 35: sp???a. D., R., L. are certainly right in putting a comma after this word: in this play a pause before the last iambus precedes a vocative (251, 453, etc.) or has another emphatic effect (963, 1238). Oranje (178 n. 98) quotes 273 as a counter-example, but there is certainly no pause before ds??. 36: ???a??e?. D. writes: "???? does not mean a grown woman in contrast with a girl" (similarly R.: "sans distinction d'?ge"; ?.: "a typical Euripidean redundancy"), but we often find t???a (pa?de?) ?a? ???a??e?. Consequently, pa?????? (694) were included, but young girls were not, and the phrase is not tautological after pa? t? ???? sp???a (Oranje, 178 n. 98), but restrictive. 36: ??????a. Elsewhere 'to drive mad completely', here with a separative genitive. Similarly ??a???????a? 'to struggle vehemently', but Or. 431 ??a??????ta? se ???. 37: ????. Not to be connected with ??a?e?e?????a? (D., R.), but with pa?s??. D. refers to S. El. 715 ???? d? p??te? a?a?e?e???????, but there more probably ???? emphasizes p??te? (cf. Phoen. 1696, LSJ s.v. pa? A I 2), and to Ba. 18, but there ?' ???? means 'as well'. 37 : pa?s??. Goes both with ???? and ??a?e?e?????a?. 37: ??a?e?e?????a?. We should expect that Cadmus' daughters mingle with the other women, not that the other women mingle with Cadmus' daughters, but the verb may have the meaning of 'to be in the company of : cf. Horn, ? 246-7 ??d? t?? a?t? ??s?eta? 'nobody gets into touch with her*. 38: ???ta??. Not 'sapins' (G., R., L.; Werner 'Fichten'; LSJ 'silver fir'), but 'firs' (German 'Tannen'): cf. G. G. Anpetkova- Sarova?-G.V. Piontek, Phil. 120 (1976), 21-31. 38: ?????f???. The contrast assumed by K., "in the open air?in their houses", is too flat, and R.'s explanation, "elles n'ont d'autre</page><page sequence="10">IO THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE abri que les arbres", is meaningless. The Bacchantes are so free from care that they do not hide themselves in caves, but reveal themselves by sitting on rocks (K. rightly observes that p?t?a?? does not mean 'among rocks', but 'on rocks'). 35-8. H. J. Tschiedel, A.u.A. 23 (1977), 67, writes: "Es ist, als habe sich die Vorstellung des ruhigen, geordneten, aber eben auch eingeengten und dumpfen Lebens innerhalb der famili?ren Ge- meinschaft der beiden ersten Trimeter und der dunklen F?rbung des durch die Endstellung in seiner Gewichtigkeit hervorgehobenen d???t?? irgendwie niedergeschlagen, w?hrend die St?rung der Ordnung, der Aufenthalt in der lichten, freihen Natur im zu- nehmend unregelm?ssigen Bau der beiden folgenden Verse mit ihrer F?lle heller Schlussdiphthonge h?rbar zu werden scheint". But (1) disturbance of order is characteristic of 35-6 (??????a), whereas the atmosphere of 37-8 is rather static (??ta?). (2) The idea that ? is a dark sound is based on modern pronunciation: in reality it was a "long, open 0, as in French fort" (OCD, 884). O. J. Todd, Sense and Sound in Classical Poetry, CQ 36 (1942), 29-39, points out that repetition of sound does not always have an expres- sive function. (3) Illustrative use of metre is comparatively rare in Greek poetry, and it is well to remember Leaf's note on Horn. ? 511 : "Mr Nicholson has pointed out that the two passages which in all Homer shew the largest consecutive number of purely dactylic lines (five) occur in the description of Patroklos' funeral (? 135-9, 166-70)". Cf. also the interesting remarks made by K. J. McKay in AUMLA 22 (1964), 191-5 on Callim. Epigr. 63, 1. 39: ???a?e??. For ??- 'thoroughly' cf. Wilamowitz on H.F. 155, R. Renehan, Studies in Greek Texts (G?tingen 1976), 24 ff. 40: ?t??est?? ??sa?. Oranje (177 ?. 95) rightly observes that this does not mean 'that she still has to be initiated', but 'that she is uninitiated'. He refers to Wilamowitz's translation 'dass ihm der Segen meiner Weihen fehlt'. It would be clearer to say 'what it means to remain uninitiated'. 40 : ?a??e???t??. Such genitives (cf. e.g. I.T. 487 ??e?p?? s?t???a?) are usually explained as objective or separative (K.G., I, 401-2), but it is more natural to take them as limiting the action to a special field (see above, on 33 f?e???).</page><page sequence="11">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE II 42: t??te?. For the perfective sense ('to be mother of) cf. Io 1560, S. O.R. 1247, El. 342, K.G., I, 137 (who wrongly refer to Ba. 2). See also above, on ? ???, and my note on Hes. Th. 45 ?t??te?, Mnem.

IV 1 (1948), 278-9, and rightly criticizes the comparison drawn there between Pentheus and Hippolytus. He suggests that ?e??a?e? may have the implication of 'waging an impossible war', but Kamerbeek is undoubtedly right in sticking to the literal meaning. On the other hand, his translation 'who fights against my divine power' is misleading: ?e??a?e? is used absolutely, and ta ?at ??? means 'as far as I am concerned' (cf. LSJ s.v. ?at? ? IV 2). R. rightly calls the last words a "restriction capitale. Penth?e n'est pas un impie: il adresse aux dieux libations et pri?res. Il refuse d'honorer Dionysos parce qu'il croit que celui-ci n'est pas un dieu". 45: ?a?. Has explanatory (specifying) force: see above, on 21 ???e?. 46: ??da???. 'In no way': cf. LSJ II, and s.v. p??

Hamilton, TAPA 104 (1974), 145 ff., wrongly</page><page sequence="12">12 THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE argues that this predicts an epiphany of the god and that such an epiphany is implied in the palace miracle (589 ff.). It is true that the Bacchantes assume Dionysus to be present in the shaking palace, but they do not actually see him, and when Dionysus appears he is still distinguishing himself from the god (605-6). Cf. Chromik, 246-7 and espec. 275 n. 23. These plain facts are en- shrouded by Hamilton in clouds of irrelevant parallels. He is especially impressed by the fact that thunder and lightning occur both at Dionysus' birth and as part of the palace miracle, and he rushes at the conclusion that the latter is a "reflection of the birth myth" (148). These mystifications seem to have their origin in a curious misunderstanding of the phrase ?e?? ?e??? ??de????a?: this does not refer to a "birth epiphany" (145), but to the fact that Dionysus was born as a god and therefore is a real god: for this use of ?e??? cf. 199, 284, 1332,1347, H-F-1320, fr. 843. Dionysus shows his divine nature by manifesting his power, and this is done through- out the play: cf. Winnington-Ingram, 25, 135, 164-7, an(i already F. Wassermann, NJhB 5 (1929), 273: "Das ganze St?ck eine grosse Epiphanie des Dionysos"; 277: "eine wahre Epiphanie mehr der Kraft als der Person". See also A. J. Podlecki, AC 43 (1974), 152-4, Oranje, 106 ff., espec. 114. 48: te. 'And generally', hence 'and to all the other Thebans'. Similarly 309. See further my note on Pind. 0. 7, 55 te ?a? in Meded. Kon. Ned. Akad. v. Wet., Lett. N.R. 35:2 (1972), 250. 50: p????. As the executive of Pentheus' orders: cf. A. J. Podlecki, AC 43 (1974), 148-9. 52: ??????. ?. notes: "This never happens in the play, though it is envisaged at 780 ff. It is perhaps mentioned to titillate the audience with the possibility of an unusual development". It seems simpler to assume that the sentence has been added in order to emphasize the god's resoluteness : he will carry through the propaga- tion of his cult under any circumstances (Schmid, 660, rightly points out that "Dionysos ist unter den Olympiern der einzige, der als Missionar seiner eigenen Religion und als K?mpfer f?r sie gegen menschlichen Widerstand wirkt"). It should be borne in mind that the possibility of an armed conflict is mentioned as a mere event- uality. Cf. A. P. Burnett, CP 65 (1970), 18: "punishment is only a</page><page sequence="13">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE I3 potential contingency"; 19: "Dionysus and Pentheus are not yet inextricably connected as the author and the subject of a particular fate; war has not yet been declared between them". Grube (401) already observed: "Dionysus is proudly insisting that he shall be recognized and worshipped in Thebes at all costs, but he has not decided that the cost must be high". Accordingly, it is wrong to interpret 50-2 as a kind of programme, and to look for traces of a (non-formal) battle in the extant play, as is done by R. Hamilton, TAPA 104 (1974), 140 ff. He is right in rejecting the explanation of the sentence as a suggestio falsi (advocated e.g. by D. and Willink, 30), but he neglects the words e? dp???? in his paraphrase and mistranslates ?????? by ? will get hold of him' (supplying a?t?? and equating this to a?t?? = Pentheus! He adds that "even if ????? is to be supplied, we need not assume this refers to a 'bataille rang?e' " [143 n. 11], but st?at???t?? shows that a formal battle is meant; cf. also 761-4, 798-9). His interpretation of the attack on Pentheus is equally artificial: he maintains (144) that "the language of the whole scene is military" and that the maenads "attack Pentheus with spears and the epic missiles, ?e???da? ??ata???????. The battle cry is raised". But these 'spears' are in fact 6??? (1098) and ????a??? (1133) denotes cries of triumph (cf. H.F. 981, El. 855, S. Ant. 133, Ar. Av. 1763) rather than a battle cry. Besides there is no real battle, because Pentheus is helpless. See also Oranje, 179 n. 101, 201 n. 196, 228 n. 312. 52: ?a???s?. According to D., the dative (cf. K.G., I, 409-10) stresses "the physical act of leading" (similarly R.: "le datif d?signant l'action exerc?e sur le subordonn?"). It is simpler and clearer to explain the dative as a dat. of interest. L.'s "datif instru- mental" is of course impossible. 53: ?????a? ???. Not quite equivalent to ???a?a, as is suggested by D. and L., but 'after having assumed I have now': cf. K.G., II, 61-2, W. J. Aerts, Periphrastica (Amsterdam 1965), 140-1. For the meaning 'get in exchange' cf. LSJ III 1, and see above, on 4 ??e??a?. Accordingly, Aerts (141) is wrong in calling ???t?? "proleptic". 54: te.

Prom. 152, in: Miscellanea tragica J. C. Kamerbeek (Amsterdam 1976), 455. 54: f?s??. 'Apparence' (L.) is better than 'nature' (R.): cf. LSJ II 2. Willink (30) argues that 53-4 are an interpolation, because (a) they have no adequate antecedent: "the only deducible impli- cation is that Dionysus would not have taken on mortal form but for the prospect of a clash of arms?which is absurd", and (b) they spoil the structure of the Prologue. But Willink seems to have overlooked the emphatic function of the ring-composition (cf. Winnington-Ingram, 47 n. 3): 53-4 recall 4, and ?? does not refer to the immediately preceding lines, but to the whole description of the situation at Thebes. Grube (401 ?. ?) rightly observes that "the god ends his speech by saying that he has taken on human form for the general purpose of seeing that Thebes recognize him, not for the specific purpose of leading the Bacchants in battle". This is preceded by the remark, "?? 2?e?a in 53 echoes the same expres- sion in 47. It is resumptive". But ?? ???e?a at 47 introduces the more general conclusion that Dionysus will have to show his divine power to the Thebans, not that he will do so in a human disguise. The description of the situation at Thebes suggests that the dif- ficulties, and even dangers, to be expected there will be so serious that Dionysus cannot content himself with his usual role as the invisible power behind his ??as??, but this is not a sufficient ex- planation of his disguise. Grube's suggestion (loc. cit.) that "he has taken on human form to try to secure recognition with the least trouble to all" is meaningless. His remark in TAPA 66 (1935), 38 ?. 3, "Gods do not persuade, they command, as Dionysus will have to do when his more goodnatured offers are rejected", is more helpful: if Dionysus had manifested himself as a god from the outset, he might have forced Pentheus to worship him as he forced the Theban women, but this would not have meant a true recogni- tion. Dionysus wants from Pentheus a voluntary and official act of acknowledgment as is shown by a man towards a man. See further Chromik, 244 ff. The explanatory character of the Prologue has a purely didactic purpose, and is not intended to reveal Dionysus' feelings of offence</page><page sequence="15">THE PROLOGUE OF EURIPIDES BACCHAE 15 and revenge, as is suggested by Oranje (179 n. 100). The didactic element comprises both factual information and emotional appeal, for "hinter den belehrenden Worten des Gottes sp?rt man die unheimliche Kraft seines Wirkens" (Wassermann, loc. cit. [above, on 47]). 55 : ???a. Marks the transition from reflection to action : cf. 197, 309, Denn., 14. 59: ??t???. I do not believe that this is intentionally ambiguous: 'my mother'?'the Mother', as is suggested by L., for Dionysus has emphatically mentioned Semele as his mother (9, 26, 41). Else- where, e.g. in Eur. fr. 586, Rhea or Cybele is represented as Diony- sus' mother: cf. D. on 78-9, Nilsson, GGR, I, 579. 61 : ?pcf. R. : "Le verbe, pris absolument, est ici charg? d'un sens religieux: dans le vocabulaire des myst?res, l'initi? (l'?popte) voit, tandis que le profane ne voit pas". This is obviously wrong: not all the citizens can become ?p?pta?, but they will watch the power of the Bacchantes, who do not shrink from making a demonstration around the royal palace (cf. 22 e?fa???, 50 de????? ??a?t??).
