<plain_text><page sequence="1">4 EARLY MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENT AND BURIAL OUTSIpE THE ENCLOSED TOWN: EVIDENCE FROM ARCHAEOLOilCA? EXCAVATIONS AT BRIDE STREET, DUBLIN By Mary McMahon * [Received 7 February 1995 Read 26 September 2001 Published 20 December 2002 ] Abstract This report describes the results of a limited archaeological excavation carried out between October and December 1993 in advance of the construction of a local authority housing scheme on the east side of Bride Street, Dublin. The excavation revealed five phases of activity. The evidence for phase I consisted of a spread of refuse and two rubbish pits, followed by an attempt at levelling up the ground by the deposition of sterile clays, the final layer of which provided a fairly level compact surface over most of the site. On the new ground the remains of a rectangular-shaped structure together with a hearth were excavated, which related to a second phase of domestic activity. The evidence from later deposits indicates a date between the eighth and tenth centuries for the settlement activity associated with both these phases. Phase III saw the beginning of a division in land use between the east and the west of the site. Burials occurring in the east of the site, which post-dated the earlier settlement, may mark the western extent of a graveyard associated with the church of St Michael le Pole. After the graveyard went out of use in the eleventh or twelfth century, the evidence suggests that this eastern side of the site was being used for agricultural or horticultural purposes during phases IV and V. To the west, heavy, silty clays were clearly not cultivated, but industrial activity, including copperworking and ironworking, predominated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Associated features included a hearth with a channel or chute, possibly a run-off for molten metal, and pit furnaces. Historical and topographical survey Introduction The site lies outside the medieval walls of Dublin, on the southern side of the city (see Fig. 1?figures are grouped together at the end of this fascicle). The recovery, by excavation, of skeletons dating to between the eighth and tenth centuries suggests that the excavation site formed part of a graveyard associated with an early ecclesiastical establishment. There were two churches in the immediate area, those of St Brigid and St Michael le Pole. Geographically, the excavation site is closest to St Brigid's, although Bride Street runs between the site and the church. St Michael le Pole, the second church-site, lies approximately one hundred metres further to the east. It seems likely, however, that the graveyard is associated with the latter church (Fig. 2).

Royal Irish Academy</page><page sequence="2">68 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy St Michael le Pole The site of the church and graveyard of St Michael le Pole is well known and consisted of a church and round tower, both of which were demolished only in the eighteenth century (Gowen 2001, 19-20). The earliest cartographic represen tation is Speed's map of Dublin, dated 1610 (Fig. 3), although it is incorrectly no ta ted. In this depiction no enclosing wall is visible and the precinct extends as far as Bride Street. By way of contrast, St Brigid's church to the west has an enclosing wall (Fig. 3, 64). The church of St Michael le Pole or 'St Michael of the pool' was so-called because of its proximity to the large pool south of Dublin castle, known as the 'black pool' or dubhhnn (Public Record Office of Ireland (PROI) 1888, no. 252, 83). It is usually associated with a group of early churches situated in the south-east suburb of medieval Dublin. These churches, namely St Patrick's, St Brigid's, St Kevin's and St Peter's, have been ascribed to the pre-Norman period (Clarke 1977, 39). Both Clarke and Bradley point out that the cult of St Michael was flourishing m Ireland in the pre-Norman period and that the dedication may be original (Clarke 1977, 39; Bradley 1992, 52). Of more importance, a poem preserved in the book of Ui Maine (dated c. 1121) refers to the cult figures of M?el Ruam (Tallaght) and Michael. This may refer to the church of St Michael le Pole, the round tower built 'in a spirit of Hiberno-Norse revivalism' (Clarke 2000, 45). Early ecclesiastical centre at Dublin The existence of references m the annalistic records to abbots at Dublin in the seventh and eighth centuries (Clarke 2000, 40) suggests the presence of an early ecclesiastical centre, sited somewhere near the 'black pool' at Dublin Castle. It has been suggested that the strikingly oval configuration of the streets of St Peter's Row, Whitefriar Street, Upper and Lower Stephen's Street and Mercer Street, south-east of the pool, may preserve the outline of a large oval enclosure, a feature of other ecclesiastical centres (Clarke 1979, 39). However, archaeological excava tions at the site of the church of St Michael le Pole have provided evidence that indicates that this in fact may well be the location of the early ecclesiastical centre at Dublin (Gowen 2001, 48-51). St Michael le Pole was sited on the banks of the black pool and had a round tower, a feature of many other early foundations. Evidence of pre-Viking levels, dated to between the late seventh century and the ninth century, was revealed (Gowen 2001), thus indicating settlement on this site before the Vikings arrived in Dublin in AD 841. The continuity of the site into the Viking period was demon strated by the discovery of a series of pre-church graves, one of which was a lintelled grave (usually an indication of a high-status individual) This grave was cut by the church (built in the early twelfth century) and produced a date between the late tenth and late twelfth centuries (Gowen 2001, 36). The archaeological excavation at Bride Street has also produced a similar sequence of activity and chronology, which appears to link both sites. At Bride Street evidence of early settlement was revealed, represented by rubbish pits and the remains of a rectangular-shaped structure and associated hearth (see phases I?III). This activity was sealed by burials, dated to between the eighth and the</page><page sequence="3">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 69 tenth centuries. On this basis it seems reasonable to link Bride Street with St Michael le Pole, the possible site of the early ecclesiastical settlement at Dublin. The lack of archaeological information makes it difficult to link the early activity at Bride Street with the church of St Brigid, which, as Bradley points out, is probably post-Viking in date (Bradley 1992, 52). In addition to this, Bride Street physically separates the excavation from the church of St Brigid. Although this street is first named in the Anglo-Norman period (see below), Alan Hayden established the antiquity of its continuation northwards, Werburgh Street, which he dated to the late tenth century (Simpson 2000, 32). The balance of probability is that Bride Street, leading to Werburgh Street, is of similar antiquity. The scant historical record may also help to explain what happened in the area around Bride Street after the Vikings arrived. In 1170 the area around Bride Street was held by the priory of the Holy Trinity (Christ Church), who had received it from the ruling Hiberno-Scandinavian leader in Dublin at the time, Asculf Mac Torcaill (McNeill 1950, 29). This family appears, from medieval documentary toponymical evidence, to have dominated land-holding in the south ern suburb Included in lands given to the priory 'of Earl Hasgall's gift' was St Brigid's church and lands in the parish. The city gate at Nicholas Street was called 'porte Hasculf or Hasculfs gate (c. 1190: McNeill 1950, 29). The sources also refer to Earl Hascald's garden, which was probably located on the east side of Bride Street. The excavation at Bride Street has indicated that this side of the street may originally have formed part of the early cemetery, which was out of use by the twelfth century. The 'garden-type' soil that overlay the cemetery may have been part of Asculf s garden, which was under cultivation (see The garden 'Paradise' below and phase IV). In summary, the archaeological and historical evidence suggests that the ecclesiastical centre at St Michael le Pole originally encompassed a large area, stretching from Ship Street Great as far west as Bride Stieet. However, some of the western lands, towards Bride Street, had been seized some time before the mid-twelfth century and probably considerably earlier, when the Vikings took Dublin. This side of the cemetery was subsequently rendered obsolete, and the lands became part of the demesne lands of the ruling dynasty in Dublin. Burials continued, however, on the site of St Michael le Pole (Gowen 2001, 37-42). The Anglo-Norman period Although the ecclesiastical site at St Michael le Pole had contracted in size and importance by the twelfth century, there was a continuation of an ecclesiastical presence at St Michael le Pole throughout the medieval period. The continued use of the church was probably in response to the radical changes in the surrounding topography, which rendered the area available for settlement. Previ ously, the land around Bride Street had been dominated by the Poddle river, which flowed across the valley, crossing Bride Street somewhere north of St Brigid's church (Simms 1978). However, shortly after the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1170 the Poddle was diverted to flow along Patrick Street and into the city ditch, thus containing it (Walsh 1997, 5-41) This probably resulted in the area around Bride Street being drained somewhat and available for settlement. This was borne out by an excavation at the corner of Bride Street and Ship Street, which located the original bed of the Poddle, before it was diverted up Patrick</page><page sequence="4">70 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Street. This old river bed was sealed by a series of three post and wattle/timber structures, the uppermost one of which was dated to the early thirteenth century (Simpson 2000, 42-3; Simpson 1994). Bride Street There are difficulties in locating the name Bride Street in the early Anglo-Norman period, as the names of streets had not stabilised by this time. A land grant in the area dated to between 1231 and 1242 illustrates this problem. The source refers to a road, which 'extends from the north of St Patrick's cathedral eastwards to Polla' (Polla was the area round the black pool) (PROI 1892, no. 662, 112) but does not name the street (probably Bride Street or possibly * Crosse Lane'). Similarly, a later land-grant, dated to 1356, described roads outside the gate as 'the crossways, of which one goes towards St Brigid's church on the south and the other goes towards the Poll mills on the east' (PROI 1892, no. 662, 112). The former may suggest that it was not a road as such but rather a lane leading to the church, while the latter must refer to Ship Street Little. In 1338, however, there are references to a 'highway' in St Brigid's parish, which usually denotes a major route. Elias de Asshebourne, a prominent citizen of Dublin, was granted lands in the 'polle', parish of St Brigid, extending from the 'highway' to St Brigid's Church (PROI 1892, no. 615, 104). Only in 1499 is the street finally named. A land-grant was located by reference to 'Bride Street on the west...the street from the bridge to the Poll mill on the north' (PROI 1892, no. 615, 104). St Brigid's church The second church close to the excavation site was St Brigid's church, lying on the western side of Bride Street, which appears to have been the dominant church in the area. The church was a pre-Norman foundation and was granted to the Priory of the Holy Trinity by Asculf MacTorcaill (McNeill 1950, 29). The church was listed in a confirmation grant, dated c. 1179, along with other possessions in the area (McNeill 1950, 7). It was also known in medieval documents as 'St Brigid's of the pool' and 'St Brigid's of the pole', although it was located a good distance from the pool (PROI 1892, no. 498, 81). In 1191, however, it was granted, with St Kevin's and St Nicholas's, to St Patrick's when St Patrick's was elevated to prebendal status (McNeill 1950, 19). The priory possibly received the church of St Paul in exchange (McNeill 1950, 81). The garden 'Paradise' There was a large garden in the parish of St Brigid in the medieval period, known as 'Paradise', which was possibly the survival of part of Asculf MacTorcaill's garden. In 1428 a grant of land mentions the 'great garden in the parish of St Brigid the Virgin and St Michael of the poll' (PROI 1892, no. 904, 144). In 1485 John Watynge received 'a messuage and a tan-house with a bawn and haggard place in St Brigid's Parish...and an orchard adjoining'. The orchard is later named as 'the paradise' in a reference dated three years later (PROI 1888, no. 352, 100). The tanning house was located on the corner of Ship Street Little and Bride Street, and therefore the garden must have extended along the eastern side of Bride Street, where the excavation site is located (PROI 1888, no. 352, 100). This garden survived into the late medieval period.</page><page sequence="5">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 71 The excavation During October and December 1993 an archaeological excavation was under taken by the present writer at Bride Street, Dublin, on behalf of Dublin Corpora tion (now Dublin City Council) in advance of a housing development (Fig. 1). The archaeology of the site had been considered at a very early stage in the prepara tion of plans for the development of the site. In 1987 trial bores were examined but revealed no evidence for archaeological stratigraphy. Again in 1992 the city archaeologist excavated a number of test trenches, the results of which revealed very little evidence for medieval activity on the site. However, it was decided to carry out an excavation in the vicinity of one of the test trenches, which had shown a charcoal spread on what was considered to be the natural boulder clay. In the course of the excavation it was discovered that the 'boulder clay' was rede posited. The excavation was funded by Dublin Corporation, and full provision was made for it within the construction programme by the Housing Construction Branch of the Corporation, which also provided the on-site facilities and any assistance required during the course of the excavation. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands facilitated the post-excavation work by provid ing accommodation. The Heritage Council also part-funded the preparation of the report for publication under the Archaeology Grant Scheme 2000. The area to be excavated measured a maximum of 16.1m east-west by 14m north-south, which was progressively reduced as the depth of the excavation increased (Fig. 1). From the test trenches it was known that the modern rubble overburden was c. 1.5m deep. This was cleared in advance of the excavation using a mechanical digger. On commencement of site works, two brick and stone-built basements(?) (Fig. 11, F9 and Fll) and a rubbish pit (Fig. 11, F10), which had cut into the medieval deposits on the site, were removed by machine. The remains of a red-brick drain (Fig. 11, F3) occurred c. 1.5m deep, just beyond the northern edge of the excavation. Several other less substantial post-medieval features that overlay the medieval deposits were excavated by hand (Figs 8, 9 and 11, F4, F5, F6, F7, F12, F15, F16 and F23). The entire site was also cleared back by hand in order to remove any post-medieval contamination from the surface of the medieval de posits (Figs 8 and 9, F2). The OD levels given in the report are related to the Ordnance Survey established datum at the corner of Little Ship Street and Great Ship Street. The national grid reference number for the site is 31531 23371. All features (including layers and structures) were given feature numbers as they were revealed, e.g. Fl, F2, F3. As they were recovered, each artefact was given a National Museum catalogue number followed by the feature number. The excavation licence num ber 93E153 was used as a prefix, but this has been omitted in the report. Phase I (Figs 4-7) The earliest phase of activity recovered from the excavation belongs to a period that pre-dated the introduction of a large volume of redeposited boulder clay onto the site (Figs 5-7, F133). Both during the test trenching and almost until the end of the excavation, this clay had been thought to be natural boulder clay. It was the presence of a deposit with a very black charred appearance (Figs 4 and 5,</page><page sequence="6">72 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy F126)?which initially was interpreted as the bottom layer of a later pit F123 (Fig. 7)?that alerted us to the possibility that the natural-appearing and sterile clays were in fact redeposited. On further excavation deposit F126 was found to spread in all directions, i.e. to the north, south, east and west, below the clay F133. Microscopic examination of deposit F126 showed that many of the stones in the sample were stained orange. The deposit also contained isolated chips of charcoal, fragments of animal bone and shellfish remains. The sample was inorganic and it could be that 'indicators' of human activity originally made up a greater part of the deposit but were not preserved. Deposit F126 was stratified above a deposit of grey clay (Fig. 5, F160) that formed an approximately round-shaped 'mound', which was both covered and encircled by deposit F126. The depth of material lying above the spread of refuse (F126) as it sloped downwards to the east was very substantial. It consisted of the yellow clay (F133) over deposits of firm, brown, stony clay. Both the sterile nature of these clays and their volume, in addition to time constraints, necessitated the use of a machine to explore the stratigraphy further. Three machine trenches were dug (Figs 4-6, trenches A, B and C). Trench A (Fig, 4), This trench, measuring approximately 7,3m north-south by 3.1m east-west, was excavated at the west of the site to a depth of c. 10.02m OD, i.e. 3m below modern ground level. This was a little below the base of the disturbance caused by post-medieval structures. The eastern section face of this trench partially cut through a small stretch of deposit F126 and the underlying clays but did not reveal anything informative. A deposit similar to the charcoal (F126), but much more organic (Fig. 4, F134) covered much of the grey clay (F139) found at the base of the trench. The relationship between F126 and F134 was not clear, but it appeared that the spread (F126) sloped down to the west, levelled off and mixed with the deposit of pungent material (F134), which contained both charcoal and organic matter. This spread, thinly in places, over much of the surface of the underlying grey clay (F139) within the trench. Some occurred within a rounded depression (F137?see below) with a heavy concentration occurring to the west where F134 is marked on Fig. 4. Three other features, F135, F136 and the base of F118 (see phase IV), were found to cut into the grey clay (F139). Pit F136 (Fig. 4) was sub-rectangular in shape and measured 1.08m north-south by 1.98m east-west. It occurred in the south-west corner of the trench and extended westwards beyond the edge of the excavation. The fill consisted of a black organic deposit piled up to form a slight mound, 0.49m deep at the west and sloping to 0.39-0.2m deep at the east. The sides of the pit were straight and the base flat, but sloping slightly to the east. The only finds were animal bone and one small, fist-sized, smooth, water-rolled stone. A second straight-sided pit (Fig. 4, F135) with rounded corners was revealed. This also extended westwards beyond the area of the excavation. It measured 1.34m north-south by 1.14m east-west by 0.15-0.3m deep, shallower at the south end. It contained a black charred fill. Examination of this revealed charred animal bones, apple pips, hazelnut shell fragments and charred gram (oat and wheat). Blackberry seeds, mussel shell fragments and fish bone were also present. The base of the pit was flat in the centre with a very gradual slope around the outer edge. The sides were relatively straight, and a series of post- and stake-holes</page><page sequence="7">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 73 occurred around this edge. Two squared post-holes at the north-eastern and south-eastern corners measured 0.13m by 0.15m by 0.11m deep at the north-east and 0.12m by 0.08m by 0.15m deep at the south-east. The other post-holes were smaller and rounded, averaging 0.04m by 0.05m by 0.08-0.13m deep. An approximately circular pit (Fig. 4, F137), with a diameter of c. 0.65m, had a flat base and shallow, straight sides. It was 0.1m deep. It lay to the north-east of pit F135 and was filled with the charcoal-organic deposit (F134), which was concen trated in this area. Two other machine trenches were excavated in an east-west direction at both the north and south of the site, trench B to the north and trench C to the south (Figs 4-6, sections QP and KL). Both of these trenches were only approximately lm wide but were sufficient to provide profiles of the site's stratigraphy along its east-west axis. Trench B, Section QP (Figs 4 and 5). The south-facing section of this machined trench gave a profile through the refuse spread (F126), the underlying grey clays and the redeposited clays that overlay it. As the trench was cut across the circular mound of clay (F160), which was covered on all sides by the refuse deposit (F126) described above (Fig. 4, trench B), the impression given by Section QP (Fig. 5), of a ditch and subsequent fill, is misleading. A better understanding of the nature of the deposits can be seen in Section KL (Figs 4 and 6, trench C). On the section face it was possible to follow the deposit (Fl 26) above the layer of mottled light grey-brown clay containing stones and some flecks of charcoal (Fig. 5, F160). It spread eastwards above the slope of this clay as it dipped down and began to level off further to the east. F160 overlay further bands of grey and grey-brown clays (Fig. 5, F161-F167). The clays (Fig. 5, F133 and F168-F173) deposited above the eastward slope of the spread (F126) were yellow-brown to orange-brown in colour and had a strikingly different colour tone from the lower clays. In total these deposits were a 1.75m deep, and although minor variations could be observed, they were all very similar and homogeneous in nature. Trench C, Section KL (Figs 4 and 6). This machine-excavated trench lay 0.34-0.7m to the south of the southern edge of the excavation. The section face indicated a similar range of stratigraphy as described for Section QP. Below the redeposited yellow clay (Fig. 6, F188?similar to F133 in trench B) was a series of brown, stony clays overlying deposits of grey-brown/grey-blue clays that sloped down to the east (Fig. 6, F189-F192). Here the grey clays showed a gentle rise to the west. However, there was no evidence for the refuse spread (F126), which had petered out somewhere between the two trenches. The uppermost deposit of the grey clays (Fig 6, F180) was cohesive, containing rounded and some angular stones, lying both flat and upright, and pebbles. There appeared to be charcoal smears, but the deposit may also have contained some rotten black mudstone, which would smear m a similar fashion to charcoal. More frequent pebbles occurred towards the base of the deposit. A horizontal band of stones (Fig. 6, F181) occurred near the top, at a similar level to F191 and F192. A concentration of very black wet charcoal (Fig. 6, F182) possibly represented the fill of a pit/cut, but this was not clear from the section alone. There was a vertical division between the grey clay (F180) and a marbled grey-brown cohesive clay (Fig. 6, F183) containing pebbles, small stones and frequent charcoal smears and stains.</page><page sequence="8">74 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy A deposit of firm, grey-brown cohesive clay with frequent pebbles and small stones (Fig. 6, F185) lay at the base of the above clays and appeared more natural than redeposited. Beneath this a further deposit of brown, stony clay also appeared to be a natural deposit (Fig. 6, F186). Phase I?Interpretation and discussion The earliest evidence of settlement on the site was represented by a black organic deposit, which was excavated in trench A (F134). As far as could be observed this was related to the refuse spread (Figs 4 and 5, F126). The pungent nature of the deposit was probably due to the preservation of organic matter, which was to a great degree absent from the rest of the site. Two rubbish pits (F135 and F136) were also associated with this level of activity. Post- and stake-holes around the edge of one of the pits may be all that remains of a post-and-wattle lining. There were no finds associated with these deposits. The two east-west trenches, B and C, which were machine excavated, revealed that a large quantity of boulder clay had been deliberately laid down over most of the site. In trench B the layers of clays outlined in Fig. 5 (F133, F168-F173) were redeposited boulder clay. These were distinguishable from deposits F160-F163 by a difference in colour and clay types. The upper deposits were completely sterile, whereas layers F160-F163 contained charcoal flecks. Similar layers of redeposited clays were also exposed in trench C excavated further south (Fig. 6, F188-F192). These overlay grey clays (F180-F186) that contained charcoal inclusions. The introduction of the boulder clay onto the site represented an attempt at levelling the ground, which was revealed in both trenches to slope gently down wards from west to east. The uppermost spread of redeposited clay (F133) provided a relatively level surface for later activities. There were no finds associated with this phase of activity, but evidence from overlying deposits suggests a date between the eighth and the tenth centuries for this settlement activity. Phase II (Figs 7-9 and 12) The second phase of settlement saw intensive activity on the redeposited clay surface (F133). Post-holes of a timber structure, an associated hearth and rubbish pits survived relating to this activity (Figs 7-9). The yellow clay (F133), which formed a moderately compact surface, sloped downwards into the north-east corner of the site and was somewhat higher at the south of the site, with a slight rise towards the west also. It was between 0.2m and 0.35m deep, and the surface of this deposit occurred between 10.47m OD in the north-east corner, 10.7m OD at the north-west, and 11m OD at the south. A very shallow depression (Fig. 7, Fl 25), which was wider at the west than the east, occurred in the north-east of the site. It was c. 1.25m east-west, 1.1m north-south and 0.07-0.12m deep, and contained a spread of red ash and some small pieces and flecks of charcoal indicating its use as a hearth. It also contained animal and fish bone and at least one possible charred barley grain. There were clusters of stake-holes and post-holes at each of its north-west and north-east corners, and one stake-hole at each of its south-west and south-east corners. The hole at the south-west corner was slightly larger and squared in shape, 0.15m by 0.12m by 0.29m deep, and was more of a post-hole than the other smaller holes.</page><page sequence="9">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 15 Some of the small stake-holes at the north-west and north-east were conjoined double stake-holes, and a larger one at the north-east corner was 0.40m deep. The others averaged between 0.15m and 0.35m deep. A shallow, scoop-shaped cut (Fig. 7, F122), 0.84m north-south by 0.74m east-west by 0.26m deep, occurred to the west of the hearth (F125). The sides were gently sloping and rounded, and the fill was a grey-brown, silty clay with charcoal flecks and containing some animal bone. To the north-west was a small, square-shaped cut (Fig. 7, F127), measuring 0.4m by 0.46m by 0.25m deep, which contained a grey, silty clay fill with charcoal flecks. A spread of red ash and charcoal occurred further to the north-east (Figs 7 and 9, F140). Twenty-four post- and stake-holes were found both here and running in a south-westerly direction from this point to the south of hearth F125 (Fig. 7). These post- and stake-holes were 0.12~0.04m in diameter and 0.15-0.25m deep. A general line was visible, with a cluster or possibly a double row at the east, running in a north-east-south-west direction. To the north-west of hearth F125 was a post-hole (Fig. 7, F128), 0.28m north-south by 0.26m deep, which contained small twigs of charcoal in a silty clay fill. A second conjoined post-hole occurred immediately beyond the section edge at this point, and it contained the remains of a charred post. Three small stake-holes were discovered adjacent to post-hole F128. Probably relating to these features further east was a small round cut and fill, 0.26m by 0.27m by 0.16m deep. Soft, light-yellow-brown clay (F121) was found in small patches and spreads, mainly to the south of the stake-holes and cuts F80, F125 and F122. These deposits also appeared to follow a linear north-east-south-west direction. They contained occasional charcoal flecks and animal bones, and lay direcdy above the yellow clay (F133). An elongated, narrow, approximately rectangular-shaped feature (Fig. 7, F123) lay on a north-east/south-west axis. It measured 1.68m east-west and was 0.3m wide at the west end and 0.48m at the east. It was wider and deeper (0.46m) at the eastern end, and narrower and only 0.35m deep at the west. The sides were straight. It was filled with a silty, mid-grey clay containing moderately frequent charcoal and rust-coloured flecks. Finds consisted of some animal bone and one or two small pieces of pink granite. Frequent rounded stones, measuring 0.1m by 0.15m, occurred at the base but these appear simply to have been part of the underlying layer rather than part of the fill. The top of the western half of the feature had been lowered when it was cut through by a later pit (Fig. 7, F43). The redeposited yellow clay (Fl 33) covered approximately 4.5m of the site in a north-south direction. Two slight rises and variations occurred within it to the west of pit F69 (Figs 7 and 8, phase IV) and towards the centre of the site. To the south of the site several stony, very sterile deposits were found in a slight depression or channel (Figs 7 and 9, F101A), running in a north-east-south-west direction. The stones were both rounded and angular. Further deposits of the yellow clay (F133) lay to the south of this channel, measuring approximately 7.2m east-west by 2m, and greater north-south. It appears that the yellow clay (F133) had been cut into and had filled up with, or had been filled up with, these stony layers at some point. The activity post-dated the deposition of clay (F133) but could also have post-dated this phase of activity and may more correctly be assigned to phase III or IV.</page><page sequence="10">76 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy A homogeneous brown, cohesive, silty clay deposit, containing many rounded and angular stones, lay within this channel area. At the western half of the channel there was a general deposit of a cohesive clay with frequent animal bone (F110). This was cut by a later pit (Fig. 7, F109, phase IV). A small area of grey-brown silty clay with occasional animal bones (Fig. 7, F112) cut through the yellow clay (F133) at its southern extent. It in turn was cut at the west and east by later post-medieval disturbances (Fig. 7, F9 and FIO). This deposit probably continued southwards beyond the edge of the excavation. Also cut into the yellow clay (F133) was a shallow round pit (Fig. 7, Fill). The fill was a soft brown-grey clay containing a piece of slag and animal bone. The base of the pit, which consisted of a redeposited, compact, stony green clay, sloped slightly to the west. It measured 1.28m east-west by 1.2m north-south by c. 0.32-0.36m deep, although a later pit (Fig. 7, F21) to the west had cut away a portion of this feature. It is unclear what phase this feature belonged to, and it is possible that it was cut from a higher level. A double row of eight post-holes occurred in the redeposited boulder clay (F133) in the south of the site, near pit Fill (Fig. 7). Post-medieval pit F9 cut across the line of these post-holes. To the south-east, where F133 rose slightly forming a slope, was a single post-hole (Fig. 7), measuring 0.12m by 0.12m by 0.18m deep, and a small spread containing some charcoal, both charred and uncharred animal and fish bone and charred wheat and oat grains (Fig. 7, F131). In the north-west corner of the site lay a deposit of cohesive green-brown sandy clay (Figs 7 and 8, F124), containing small pebbles, occasional charcoal flecks and frequent crushed mussel shell, measuring 1.55m north-south by 2.3m east-west. This deposit overlay a stony green-grey clay (Fig. 8, F193), which also contained crushed mussel shells. This appeared to sit in a slight depression cut into the underlying clay (F133). No finds were recovered from these deposits. Two post-holes also occurred in this area (Fig. 7). Two conjoined rubbish pits (Fig. 7, F114 and F115) occurred at the north-west of the site. Both pits were rounded and were linked together by an upper rectangular-shaped cut with rounded corners. The fills were wet, cohesive, grey silty clays with brown organic staining or discoloration around the edges. Pit F114 at the west was apparently dug out and had filled up first, with pit F115 added later. The overall elongated cut measured 2.36m east-west by 0.96m north-south. Pit F114 measured 1.1m east-west by 0.88m north-south by c. 0.6m deep. Pit F115 measured 0.88m east-west by 0.70-0.88m north-south by c. 0.7m deep. The upper elongated cut was c. 0.3m deep, creating a shallow ledge around the top of the two pits, joining the two together. The recovery of two curved roof tile fragments, of early eleventh century date, from the fill of pit F114, similar to finds from pits associated with phase III (see below), suggests that these pits may more correctly be linked with a later phase of activity. Phase II?Interpretation and discussion A considerable amount of activity took place on the firm level surface provided by the redeposited boulder clay. A series of post- and stake-holes appear to form the south-west corner of a rectangular-shaped structure. Associated with this structure was the remains of a hearth (Fig. 7, F125), which contained ash and charcoal. Further spreads of ash and charcoal to the north-east (Fig. 7, F140) could also represent hearth debris. Clusters of stake-holes at the north-west and north-east</page><page sequence="11">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 11 coiners of the hearth and stake-holes at each of its south-west and south-east corners gave the impression that they might have been the uprights for some sort of light screen or shelter around the hearth. Alternatively they may have been part of a cooking frame from which pots were suspended over the fire. The stake-hole clusters might represent renewals and replacements of old uprights. The associa tion of stake-holes and hearths has been found at other sites such as Killeder dadrum, Co. Tipperary (Manning 1984, 246, Fig. 6) and Reask, Co. Kern (Fanning 1981, 103-4, fig. 13). The eastern side of the feature was slightly curved and narrower than the western side, and it is possible that the opening of the hearth was to the west. It is most likely that the hearth was for domestic use, as indicated by the presence of some animal and fish bone refuse found in the sample. The small scoop-shaped cut (Fig. 7, F122) to the west appeared to be cut into the edge of the hearth, but it may have had an associated function as it was too small to have been a rubbish pit and too large to have been a post-hole. The spread of charcoal and burnt food refuse at the south of the site (Fig. 7, F131) could also represent hearth debris. A depression or channel to the south of the site (Fig. 7, F101A), which ran in a north-east-south-west direction, was filled with a cohesive, stony clay deposit. The channel continued eastwards beyond the area of the excavation. Its abrupt western termination would seem to preclude the possibility that it was a drainage channel. However, it might have acted as a sump to prevent waterlogging of the ground and the structure to the north. Water would have drained into it from the higher southern ground. The double row of post-holes that occurred west of the channel may have been related in some way to this feature. The deposits in the north-west corner of the site (F124 and F193), which sat above and slightly cut into the underlying clay, contained crushed mussel shells, which were not very prevalent elsewhere on the site. Seashell remains were generally very scarce throughout the site, apart from the occasional lense within a pit, so their occurrence in this area was noteworthy. Despite the general lack of organic preservation on the site, macroscopic analysis of a sample from pit F115 (Fig. 7) indicated the presence of food waste in the form of animal bone and fishbone together with some human faeces, indicat ing its use as both a rubbish pit and a cesspit. The purpose of the narrow sub rectangular feature (Fig. 7, F123) is not clear. The presence of some animal bone in the fill suggests that it was used for refuse. Burials overlying this phase of activity (see phase III) indicate a date of at least the tenth century, and possibly a date as early as the eighth century for this phase of settlement. This activity shows a remarkable similarity to the sequence exca vated at the church site of St Michael le Pole, which lies further to the east (Figs 1 and 2) (Gowen 2001). Structural post-holes, hearths and gullies represented settlement at the site of St Michael le Pole, activity dated to between the seventh and ninth centuries. The evidence from both these sites is very significant in that they have produced the earliest evidence of settlement in this part of Dublin, south of the black pool. Phase III (Figs 7-9 and 13; Pis I and II) East of the site In the east of the site a simple unprotected dug grave containing a burial (Fig. 7, F132) was discovered within the redeposited clay (F133). The left</page><page sequence="12">78 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Pl. I?Prone burial [:585(132)] from the south. side of the skeleton and grave cut was partially disturbed by the machine excavated trench B (PL I). Prior to this the clay deposit (F133) had been thought to be natural boulder clay, and after the discovery of this burial the remainder of the clay deposit was hand-excavated. The skeleton, which unusually was lying face down (prone) and orientated north-south, was of a sixteen- to twenty-year-old adolescent (the skeletal remains are fully reported on in Appendix III). The left arm was lying in front of the neck with the hand twisted back towards the face; the right arm lay in front of the chest. The skull was face downwards. No evidence of a cut for this grave was visible from the surface of the clay (F133), but the remains of the base of a cut were found, indicated mainly by a textural change and not a colour change. It appeared that the grave had been dug into the clay (F133) and then backfilled with the same material, making it very difficult to observe any difference within the yellow clays. A thin black deposit</page><page sequence="13">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin Pl. II?Burial [:579(86)1 from the east. occurred around the edge of the cut and on the skeleton, which may have been a natural leaching. The grave cut measured c. 1.53m north-south and was a maximum of 0.46m east-west (although this was not the complete width as it had been disturbed) and was 0.21m deep. It was narrower at the southern end where the feet lay, wider in the middle near the chest, and tapered again towards the north, at the head end. A shallow rectangular-shaped feature (Fig. 7, F80) was revealed in the north-east of the site, also dug into the redeposited clay (F133). The cut had straight sides,</page><page sequence="14">80 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and the base sloped gradually into a central depression, 0.18-0.2m deep. It was slightly wider (0.6m) at the western end and narrowed to the east (0.42m). It measured 1.76m along its east-west axis and was filled with the same material as the overlying deposits here (Fig. 8, F63; Fig. 9, F72), which consisted of a soft, silty, moderately friable, mid-grey clay with charcoal flecks, small stones, pebbles, animal bone and 0.5kg of small pieces of slag. Although this feature had all the appearance of a grave cut, no human remains were recovered. A small portion of a child's skull, the right parietal bone, was found in an overlying deposit (Figs 8 and 9, F55, phase IV), suggesting the disturbance of another burial in the vicinity. A second shallow elongated cut occurred to the south of the site (Fig. 7, F101). This was slightly curved but lay on an east-west axis, and within it were two disarticulated human bones (580(101)), an almost complete right femur and a complete right tibia, one of which was from a young adult. The feature measured 1.56m east-west by 0.42m north-south, by c. 0.15-0.2m deep. A deposit of light-grey-brown, loamy, silty clay (Fig. 9, F72) c. 0.05-0.12m deep, which contained frequent animal bone, occurred principally at the east and south of the site and overlay the above. A curved roof tile fragment was recovered from this deposit. Further west was a spread of mottled yellow-grey silty clay (F105). An iron ringed pm and 0.25kg of medium-sized pieces of slag were found in this deposit. A light- to mid-brown moderately friable clay (Fig. 8, F63) with some charcoal flecks and occasional crushed mussel shells, 0.25-0.28m deep, lay along the northern edge of the excavation at a similar level to the clay (Fig. 9, F72). A second simple dug grave (Figs 7 and 9, F87) which was cut into the clay (F72), measured c. 1.20m east-west by 0.38m north-south by c. 0.38m deep. The grave fill showed very little difference from the surrounding layers and was not immediately obvious during excavation. It contained a simple inhumation consist ing of a skeleton (Fig. 7, F86) lying in a supine east-west position (PL II). The right arm, the legs (except the left tibia) and the feet had been disturbed by a later pit (Figs 7 and 9, F69), and the head had slumped onto the right shoulder. The left arm lay partially behind the lower vertebrae with the head twisted back to face north in an awkward position. The remains of the right fingers lay on the pelvis. West of the site. Silty clay (F107) overlay earlier deposits in this area of the site, the only find being a curved roof tile fragment. A rectangular-shaped feature (Fig. 7, F85) cut through this deposit. It had rounded corners, straight sides and fairly straight edges and measured 2.25m east-west by 1.68m north-south by 0.3m deep. The fill was a very cohesive grey silty clay with occasional stones, moderately frequent charcoal flecks and occasional lenses of brown material with crushed shell and animal bone. Two curved roof tile fragments were recovered. Further east was another pit (Fig. 7, F50), which was round in shape, c. 1.65m in diameter, by c. 0.5m deep. It contained a cohesive grey silty clay fill, some animal bone and occasional shell fragments. The pit had a brown coloration around the sides, which might possibly have been the remains of a lining or some organic substance. It may be assumed that this pit post-dated pit F85, as it very slightly cut through the latter. Phase III?Interpretation and discussion Two articulated burials (F132 and F86), disarticulated human remains and grave cuts were discovered in the east of the site. There was no evidence from the</page><page sequence="15">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial Bride Street, Dublin 81 excavation for burials on the west side of the site for this or the later periods of activity, and this phase marks the beginning of a division between the east and the west that was to continue during the later phases of activity. The earliest evidence of burial on the site was of an adolescent (F132), which was discovered within the redeposited yellow boulder clay. Unusually the burial was prone and also orientated north-south. Unfortunately, the skeletal remains did not show evidence for the cause of death. The simple dug grave occurred in the yellow clay and was backfilled with it. The reasons for such a form of burial can only be guessed at and may have been many. The practice may have stemmed from a fear of the deceased, the character or behaviour of the individual. There may have been superstitions about the manner of the death itself, be it through disease or as a result of punishment Again, one can only speculate about the myriad of folk and religious beliefs prevalent at the time. This type of burial could be a form of ultimate punishment for something that the society concerned would regard as abhorrent. Radiocarbon dates of calibrated AD 726-979 (see Appendix II) have been obtained for this burial, placing it between the early eighth and the late tenth century. The occurrence of prone burials is uncommon. In England they are usually Romano-British, i.e. third to fifth century AD, or occasionally Anglo-Saxon, fifth to seventh century AD, and where found in a cemetery the norm would be to have no more than one (I am very grateful to Betty O'Brien for giving me the above information). In Ireland, however, a few were excavated at Ardfert Cath edral, Co. Kerry, in a c. fifteenth-century context, one of which was placed within the cathedral, the others being in the cemetery (Finbarr Moore, pers. comm.). The fact that prone burials have been found in a Christian context at Ardfert and the location of this burial beside other apparently Christian burials (see below) suggests that the individual was Christian. The elongated rectangular-shaped feature (Fig. 7, F80) had all the appearances of an east-west grave cut, with the wider end to the west and the narrower end to the east. As there was no obvious difference in the nature of the fill with the surrounding deposits, it is possible that the cut had been left open for some time prior to burial, resulting in some accidental backfilling. The absence of human remains may be explained by the truncating of the upper portion of the grave at a later date. The discovery of a portion of a child's skull confirms the disturbance caused to burials by later activity. Another grave cut (Fig. 7, F101), orientated on an east-west axis, was excav ated to the south-east of the site. The osteoarchaeologist could not be certain that the two bones, a femur and a tibia, were from the same individual. The shallow nature of the cut again suggests that the grave was truncated at some later time, which disturbed this and possibly a second burial. Burial F86, also orientated east-west, was found to be that of an older adult female, approximately five foot five inches tall, who exhibited traces of osteoarthritis. The unusual position of the left hand twisted backwards behind the back suggests that the body was either crudely laid in the grave or that it had stiffened in an awkward position before being placed in the simple dug grave. This burial stratigraphically post-dated the other articulated burial (F132), and this was confirmed by the radiocarbon dates of calibrated AD 877-1001, which shows that while both burials could have been contemporary, there could have been a minimum of twenty-two years between them.</page><page sequence="16">82 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The build-up of material above burial F132 contained a ringed pin (577(105)) as well as metalworking refuse and some animal bone. Similar pins have been found associated with tenth- and eleventh-century levels at other Dublin excav ations (Fanning 1994, 17, 53). A curved roof tile was discovered in a deposit sealing grave cut F101, indicating at the latest an early eleventh-century date. The associated small finds together with the radiocarbon dates confirm an early medieval date for the articulated burials, the grave cuts and the human remains. There were two churches in the immediate vicinity of the excavation: St Michael le Pole to the east and St Brigid's church on the west side of Bride Street. Although there are no early historic references to this street, a recent archaeologi cal excavation has established that Werburgh Street, which is a continuation northwards of Bride Street, is of late tenth-century date (Simpson 2000, 32). It is therefore possible that Bride Street is of similar date, and it is unlikely that the excavated burials, located as they are on the east side of this street, were linked with St Brigid's church. Another reason for doubting their association with St Brigid's is that it would appear that the normal medieval practice was to place burials mainly to the south of the church (McMahon 1998, fig. 2; Edwards 1990, 130). The burials are more likely to have been associated with the church of St Michael le Pole, the remains of which still exist, albeit below ground, between Ship Street Great and Chancery Lane. The recently reported excavations at the site of the church of St Michael le Pole revealed a sequence of activity, including burials, radiocarbon-dated to the late tenth or late eleventh century, very similar to the Bride Street excavation (Gowen 2001, 36). This similarity of excavated remains and chronology appears to link the two sites, and it seems reasonable to imply that the excavated burials represent the western extremity of a common burial ground. Early Irish monastic sites were characteristically enclosed within oval or circu lar embankments, or valla, with the larger sites possibly having two enclosing banks. The inner enclosures, which contained the most important ecclesiastical buildings and burial ground, frequently enclosed very large areas and had, on average, diameters ranging between 100m and 200m (Edwards 1990, 106-7; Swan 1985, 97). As the church of St Michael le Pole lies just c. 100m to the east, it is possible that the Bride Street excavation site lies within an associated enclosure. The curving nature of the street pattern at Great Ship Street and Little Ship Street, as depicted on Speed's map to the north-east of the site (Fig. 3), may reflect the edge of the ecclesiastical enclosure. A small barrel padlock of thirteenth- to fifteenth-century date (Fig. 18, 436(7)) was discovered in a later disturbed context with medieval and post-medieval finds. As with a similar one found at Greyfriars Friary, Northampton, the padlock was most likely used to secure a leather or wooden book shrine that would have been associated with an ecclesiastical context. The presence of curved roof tile frag ments also points to an association with a building of some importance such as a church. Tenth/eleventh-century domestic houses would have been roofed with thatch or a combination of sods and thatch (Wallace 1992, 56-8). West of site. During this phase silty clays become a feature of the west of the site. Difference in land usage appears to be the reason for the accumulation of the silty clay deposits, as the underlying yellow clay was fairly uniformly distributed below</page><page sequence="17">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 83 both the eastern and western deposits. Rubbish pits containing animal bone and shell fragments were the only features revealed. Curved roof tile fragments associated with these deposits indicate an early eleventh-century date for this activity. Phase IV (Figs 7-10, 13) East of site. A rounded pit (Figs 7, 9 and 10, F69) cut into and disturbed the burial (F86). It measured 1.45m north-south by 1.2m east-west by 0.44~0.54m deep. However, it extended beyond the eastern edge of the excavation. The pit fill was grey-brown silty clay, which contained fine rounded pebbles, small stones and flecks of charcoal, animal bone, mussel shell, fish bone and at least one charred cereal grain of barley (Hordeum sp.). Three curved roof tile fragments were discovered together with an iron nail, a piece of lead and a hone stone. The pit fill was darker brown in colour around the edges and may be all that remains of an organic lining. However, in general there was little or no organic material preserved on the site. Plant remains were poorly preserved and most of what did survive was charred. Deposits of 'garden-type' soil (Figs 8-10, F29, F35, F37, F55, and F59) ex tended over the burials. These layers were all fairly homogeneous with little to differentiate one from the other. In general they appeared to have a higher clay content towards the north-west corner of the site. Otherwise, they were all loamy, loose in texture, with a silty clay content, but much less cohesive than the clays to the west (see below). A sample of soil (F55) has been looked at by an environmen tal archaeologist, Brenda Collins (appendix I), and she has noted the presence in the sample of charcoal, charred grains (wheat, oat and possibly barley), charred hazelnut shell fragments and charred seeds of vetch (Vicia sp.) and fat hen (Chenopodium album). Uncharred fragments of animal bone, fish bone and mussel shell were present, as well as small deposits of both charred and uncharred deposits of human waste. Three sherds of medieval pottery (846-8(55)) were recovered from deposit F55, including two sherds of French ware and one sherd of local ware, together with a curved roof tile fragment. This deposit overlay similar type deposits (Fig. 9, F29 and F59), which were confined to the south of the area. An unidentifiable silver coin (237(29)) was discovered in deposit F29 together with some sherds of medieval pottery. These overlay a deposit of red ash (Figs 9 and 10, F75) containing flecks of charcoal and occasional fragments of burnt bone. Deposits F35 and F37, which occurred in the north-east corner, were both variations of the 'garden-type' soil. Deposit F35, which appeared to be earlier than F55, was greyer in colour than the surrounding deposits and had a higher clay content. It contained eight sherds of medieval pottery, including Saintonge ware, North French ware and four sherds of Dublin hand-built ware (fabric 004) together with a curved roof tile fragment. One sherd of Ham Green cooking ware, two sherds of North French ware and one sherd of Dublin hand-built ware (fabric 004) together with three curved roof tile fragments were recovered from deposit F37, which was a mixed variation of deposit F55 with a slightly higher clay content. Little information was retrieved from the south-south-east of the site for any phase of activity. The ground levels were considerably higher here, and it would</page><page sequence="18">84 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy seem that the upper medieval levels were destroyed by post-medieval activity. The main deposit in this area above the yellow clay (F133, phase II) and the spread of charcoal and burnt bone (F131, phase II) was a grey-green cohesive clay deposit (Figs 9 and 10, F24) with occasional charcoal and ash flecks. Four sherds of locally manufactured pottery and a fragment of copper alloy were recovered. It appeared from the excavation that this was deposited later than the ash (F75). A spread of small stones (F78) overlapped this ash deposit. A stick pm (Fig. 17, 532) was discovered in this deposit. Towards the west was a deposit (F92) that was c. 0.1m deep. It appeared to be a variation of the clay deposit F24. It contained a sherd of Ham Green ware and a sherd of Saintonge ware. This deposit covered a round pit (Fig. 7, F109) that had fairly straight sides and a flat base. It measured 1.05m east-west by 1.30m north-south by 0.75m deep. The fill was a wet grey silty clay that contained a sherd of Ham Green ware and a sherd of Dublin hand-built ware (fabric 004). As this southern portion clearly bore little relationship to the excavated features to the north, these stratigraphical details are largely irrelevant when considering the overall interpretation of the site. They would have had some meaning only if the area to the south had been excavated. West of site. Further deposits of silty clay occurred at c. 10.87m OD on the west side of the site. These clays were again predominantly grey in colour, but mixed and mottled (Fig. 10, F40). They provided a moderately firm and level surface. Two curved roof tile fragments were recovered from this deposit. At the west of the area of silty clays was a pit (Figs 7 and 10, F43), which contained a very cohesive, wet, grey silty clay fill, from which seven fragments of curved roof tiles and two pieces of slag were recovered. The sides of the pit were rounded, sloping gently to the base of the cut. Pit F43 cut through an overlying deposit of silty clay (Fig. 10, F36) as well as through the clay (F40), indicating that it was a little later stratigraphically than the F40 deposit. This pit also cut through a shallow flat-bottomed feature (Fig. 10, F48), which measured 1.45m east-west by 0.60m north-south by 0.13-0.16m deep. The fill was similar to the surrounding silty clay, and to the west the edges of the feature were very indistinct. It is possible that this was the remains of a more substantial feature that was originally deeper but disturbed and truncated by pit F43 and later activities. The function of the feature is unknown, and the only finds recovered from the fill were fragments of slag, which weighed 0.5kg in total. Another pit (Figs 7 and 8, F120) measured 2.2m east-west by 0.9m-1.2m north-south, with a maximum depth of 1.15m. It contained a variety of fills, which generally became more organic towards the base of the pit. It contained both animal bone and shell fragments. It was clearly predominantly a rubbish pit, which was left open and in use over a period of time. Two sherds of imported pottery, Ham Green cooking ware and Normandy red-painted ware, came from the upper fill of the pit. At the south-west of the site a number of pits occurred that may be slotted into this phase. One of these (Fig. 7, F66/F91) was cut through by post-medieval activity. This round pit, measuring 1.30m north-south by 0.64m east-west by 0.75m-0.85m deep, contained cohesive grey silty clay fills. A deposit of charcoal occurred around the edge of the pit. The upper fill (F66) contained two sherds of</page><page sequence="19">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial Bride Street, Dublin 85 imported English ware, an iron nail and another iron object, possibly a chisel (564(66)). A curved roof tile fragment was found in the lower fill (F91). A large approximately rectangular-shaped pit (Figs 7 and 10, F118) continued beyond the western extent of the excavation. Although cut by later post-medieval activity, the pit was found to measure c. 5.5m east-west and c. 2m north-south. Approximately eight or nine fills occurred in this feature, some of which were quite shallow, and several contained crushed shell. Covering and levelling off the pit was a firm yellow clay with stones (Fig. 10, F33), which contained a curved roof tile fragment. Towards the east of the pit, in addition to F33, a green-grey, gritty, sandy clay (F129) also covered the top of the pit. This deposit contained a sherd of local hand-built pottery together with a curved roof tile fragment. Although difficult to ascertain because of the intense disturbance caused by post-medieval activity, it would appear that these deposits pre-date the silty clays described above. North-west of site. A number of features were revealed in the north-west corner of the site which were associated with metalworking. This was probably contemporary with, or a little later than, the activity associated with the deposits of silty clay at the west of the site and the cemetery further east. An associated feature (Fig. 8, F54) continued northwards beyond the edge of the excavation. It had a square shaped corner at the south-west, its western edge was slightly curved and its southern edge turned back towards the north a little. The base sloped slightly towards the west, where the depth was 0.5m, compared with 0.33m at the east end. It contained a deposit of mixed ash and silty clay with both charcoal flecks and flecks of red ash. It also contained animal bone, 4.5kg of slag, and burnt clay. One sherd of Saintonge ware, four curved roof tile fragments and an iron hook (1158(54)) were also found. F103 was most probably a secondary fill within feature F54, or may even be part of the same feature. It contained a tiny glass bead (578(103)) and a curved roof tile fragment. To the south of feature F54, and cut by it, was a deposit of yellow-brown silty clay (F67), which contained a sherd of South-east Wiltshire ware. A rounded pit (Fig. 10, F52) cut feature F54. It measured 1.6m north-south by 1.3m east-west by c. 0.4m deep. The uppermost pit fill (F52A) consisted of a fairly pure light-brown clay from which copper alloy chain links (Fig. 17, 397B) were recovered together with a sherd of Saintonge ware and two sherds of Dublin hand-built ware (fabric 004). This clay may simply have been used to backfill and level off the top of the pit deliberately, prior to the commencement of the overlying metalworking activities (see phase V). The lower pit fills (F56 and F60) were both cohesive, grey, silty clays with charcoal flecks; F56 contained one sherd of South-east Wiltshire ware and one sherd of Dublin hand-built ware (fabric 004), while F60 contained a total of nine sherds of pottery comprising South-east Wiltshire ware, Ham Green ware, Minety ware and locally manufactured pottery. Another fairly straight-sided pit (F93), much disturbed by post-medieval activ ity, occurred to the south, measuring 1.2-1.3m east-west by 0.66m north-south by c. 0.5m deep. The pitfills (F89, F93A and F90) were all mixed with varied lenses of material, containing both charcoal and ash flecks. The lowest layer (F90) was more organic and contained fragments of decayed wood. The only finds from this pit were three curved roof tile fragments and some slag. Pit F93 had been dug into at a later date by a secondary rounded cut (Fig. 10, F74) measuring 0.96m east-west by 0.66m north-south by 0.4m deep. The</page><page sequence="20">86 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy primary fill consisted of charcoal (F82), which contained 1.75kg of slag, including four large pieces, one of which (1163(82)) may be the remains of a furnace bottom. Burnt clay fragments were also present. A curved roof tile fragment was also recovered. This was covered by a deposit that had slumped into the feature from the west (Fig. 10, F76). A deposit of mottled grey silty clay heavily flecked with charcoal and rust-coloured flecks overlay this deposit, which was, in turn, covered by a light grey-brown silty clay with frequent charcoal flecks (F62). This deposit contained 3.75kg of slag, including small vitrified pieces and a piece with burnt clay attached. A deposit of dark-grey silty clay (F94) with very frequent charcoal occurred to the west of the secondary cut (F74). It contained 3.25kg of slag, mainly large pieces. Also present were fragments of burnt clay with slag adhering and small pieces of vitrified clay. This was probably associated with the same activity as the charcoal (F82). Phase TV?Interpretation and discussion East of site. The cemetery appears to have gone out of use by this phase, but although it was no longer being used as a burial ground, the demarcation between the east and the west continued, which presumably can again be attributed to a differentiation in land usage. Although there was no definitive boundary between the two areas, a broken line on Fig. 10 gives an indication of the division. The associated pottery sherds suggest a twelfth-century date for this phase of activity. Deposits at the east of the site during this and indeed the next phase consisted of garden-type' soil, which differed noticeably from the silty clays to the west. It is possible that the eastern loamy garden soils were the result of agricultural or horticultural activities. Large quantities of organic waste were included in the deposits, and regular digging and cultivation aided mixing of the materials (Collins 1996). Vegetation in the form of crops or trees growing in this area would have added an organic loamy component to the soil in the form of dead foliage and plant life. The deposits to the west of the site may have retained their high clay content because such activities never took place there?rather, it seemed to have been used more for industrial purposes, such as metalworking, and the disposal of rubbish (see below). Presumably these garden soils evolved over a prolonged period of time, and presumably there is some difference of date between the uppermost levels and the lower levels, which contain fewer pottery sherds. This may suggest a chronological difference but could also indicate a differentiation of dispersal and inclusion within the upper and lower stratigraphy. That such divisions occurred within ecclesiastical enclosures is attested by a reference in the ninth century to a vegetable garden within the monastic enclosure at Armagh (Edwards 1990, 114). This area of the site could have been part of a large garden in Bride Street, known as Earl Hascald's garden, which survived into the late medieval period (see Early ecclesiastical centre at Dublin above). The deposit of red ash (Fig. 10, F75) clearly derived from some burning activity in the vicinity, and it would appear to have been deliberately dumped on the north-facing slope at the south of the site. It is possible that it was the waste from metalworking activities such as those suggested for the north-west and south-west of the site (see below). Presumably, whatever activities it related to took</page><page sequence="21">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial' Bride Street, Dublin 81 place beyond the area of excavation to the south of the site, from where it was dumped down the slope. West of site. The only features occurring withm the silty clays to the west of the site were rubbish pits. Such pits were generally found in backyard areas and may well have served as rubbish disposal areas for houses further to the west. North-west of site. The features found at the north-west of the site seem mainly to represent metalworking, an activity that continued into phase V. The square-shaped cut (Fig. 8, F54) with its sloping base could be either a backfilled feature associated with the surrounding metalworking, or it might simply have been an area dug out deliberately in order to dump material with a high ash content. The ash may have been the waste material from local burning associated with the metalworking activity. The slag and burnt clay must also have derived from the same events. The southern portion of the feature has the appearance of some sort of channel, which could have had a function in the metalworking process. Feature F74 was most probably the remains of a crude furnace. It was dug into the top of an existing rubbish pit and either filled up gradually or was deliberately filled. It was presumably left open long enough for material to slump mto it. It appeared to have been levelled off with a silty clay to provide a new workable level surface for the later phase V activities. The large amount of slag, the furnace bottom and the burnt clay, which is probably furnace lining, from the primary fill suggest in situ metalworking. Similar metalworking debris was associated with furnace pits excavated at Reask, Co. Kerry (Fanning 1981, 107, 118). The charcoal and slag to the west of this feature is possibly the rake-out of debris resulting from the metalworking activities. The earlier pit into which the furnace was cut appears to have been a simple rubbish pit. The organic content at the bottom might have been decayed wattles or organic material dumped with brushwood and wood. If they were wattles it is possible that they represented a pit lining, but as the remains were so decayed it is impossible to suggest this with any certainty. A considerable amount of ash was dumped into the pit with the upper fills. The lack of pottery sherds from both the furnace and the lower pit may simply imply that no domestic-type rubbish found its way into this industrial context. From the associated finds a twelfth century date is possible for this phase of activity. Phase V (Figs 8-10 and 13) East of site The uppermost medieval levels at the east of the site in this phase continued to be composed of general deposits of 'garden-type' soils (Figs 8-10, F8, F13, F22 and F28). The area covered by the soils measured approximately 8m north-south by 6.5m east-west, and the total depth of these phase V deposits was c. 0.4-0.5m. These soil deposits extended beyond the edge of the excavation to the north and east, but at the west they lay above a very gradual slope formed by the edge of the silty clays to the west (see below). To the south they also lay on a slope, slightly sharper than that to the west, which was formed by earlier phase IV deposits. They clearly therefore had a definite north-south boundary at the west and an east-west extent to the south. As with phase IV, the deposits were very homogeneous in nature, with very little differentiation between them. Separate feature numbers were largely given in</page><page sequence="22">88 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy an attempt to order the finds assemblage. However, one layer generally blended into the other without any distinction between the two. The soils were dark brown, friable, loamy clays containing moderately frequent charcoal flecks, pebbles, small stones, occasional flecks of ash and crushed shell, and animal bones. As in phase IV they had the appearance of soils that had been frequently dug over, possibly for some agricultural or horticultural purpose. In comparison with the earlier de posits, frequent sherds of both imported and locally manufactured pottery were present throughout, together with some curved roof tile fragments and metal objects including a small buckle (Fig. 17, 57(22)). While all of the deposits contained moderately large amounts of slag, layer F22 contained the largest amount (10.5kg). At the south, two features (Fig. 10, F26 and F17) occurred that were cut into the underlying deposits. It is unclear what phase they belonged to, but as they were stratigraphically later than F24 they have been put into phase V. An irregularly shaped feature (F26) measured 4.8m east-west by 0.17m deep. It extended beyond the southern edge of the excavation. It had a straight edge along the north side; it fact, it was so straight that it appeared to be a very deliberate cut, like that of a spade. The fill was a dark grey silty clay, which was quite firm and compact, with occasional crushed shells, pebbles and orange coloured flecks. The only finds were occasional animal bones and one curved roof tile fragment The purpose or meaning of the feature was unclear, particularly as its full extent was not visible. Further east was a small rounded cut (F17), which measured 0.9m east-west by 0.92m north-south by 0.29m deep. It had gradually sloping sides and a curved base, which was cut into clay (F133) of phase I. The fill was a dark grey with flecks of rust-coloured material and frequent lumps of iron slag (1kg) together with a vitrified piece. One sherd of Dublin glazed ware was also recovered. It is very possible that this feature represents the only archaeological remains of metalwork ing at the south-east of the site. West of site. Several layers of silty clays occurred to the west of the site (Fig. 10, F18, F30 and F36). These were overlapped slightly by the 'garden-type' soils at their eastern extent, where they diminished in thickness to form a gradual east-facing slope running in a north-south direction. These clays were all very similar in nature, and any differences between them were very difficult to distinguish. They were predominantly grey but mottled with varying patches and lenses. The percentage of charcoal flecks varied, but all layers contained rust-coloured flecks together with pieces of slag; layer F18 contained the highest percentage at 9kg. A deep, round pit (Fig. 10, F21) occurred towards the south of the section, measuring at the top 1.72m east-west by 1.2m north-south, by 2.45m deep. The base of the pit was c. 0.6-0.7m wide. It is probable that it was in use over a period of time, with the narrower, deeper portion filling up with a deposit of charred remains and gritty green clays (F84 and F38). Analysis of a sample of fill F84 revealed the presence of charcoal together with charred oats, wheat, fragments of animal and fish bone and mussel shell. The charcoal and charred cereal grains could represent hearth debris. No chaff or cereal weeds, indicative of crop processing waste, were present, and the cereal grains might simply represent spoilt gram tossed onto the fire as waste. A deposit of silty clay (F108) slumped into the</page><page sequence="23">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 89 top of the pit from the west, following which the upper portion was re-cut and widened slightly. The upper fills (F21A + B) were silty clays, varying in colour from mid-brown to grey-brown with charcoal flecks. Finds included animal bone and slag. A variety of medieval pottery was recovered from the various pit fills, including forty sherds of locally-manufactured pottery and fifteen sherds of imported pottery. These were mainly from the upper fills (F21A + B), with only two sherds of Dublin hand-built ware, one curved roof tile fragment and an iron toilet implement (Fig. 18, 582) from the lower fill (F84). Several medieval layers (Fig. 10, F57, F58, F61 and F102) occurred on a narrow strip that survived post-medieval disturbance (Fig. 10, F9 and Fll). These bore little meaningful relationship to the stratigraphy elsewhere on the site. However, they were probably approximately contemporary with and similar to the silty clays. The remains of a barrel padlock (Fig. 18, 400) was found in layer F58. Possibly these layers, which sloped down to the south-west, were part of a larger pit. However, they were too fragmented for it to be possible to estimate their original pattern. North-west of site including hearth F31. The deposits in this area of the site were again associated with metalworking activity. The mam activity appeared to pre-date the deposition of the silty clays. However, feature F19 (Fig. 8) was contemporary with the clays. An approximately rectangular-shaped thin spread of yellow-brown silty clay (F19), 1.26m east-west by 0.8m north-south, with a circular area of soft brown charcoal-flecked material in the centre, 0.74m east-west by 0.6m north-south, overlay a hearth (F31, see below). The function or meaning of this shallow, regularly shaped feature was unclear, but it presumably represented an upper level of activity associated with the metalworking. A light-grey and red ash in a small, shallow central hollow lay above a setting of stones/hearth (Figs 8 and 10, F31). This had an approximately semi-circular shape at the south, but continued northwards beyond the edge of the excavation, where the full extent of the stone setting was recovered. Here the flat stones formed a straight east-west edge. The hearth sat above a deposit of charcoal (Figs 8 and 10, F27) 0.15m deep. This sloped down towards both the east and the south. In the northern section face of the site it could be seen sloping to the east to a deposit of brown ash (Fig. 8, F88), frequent slag and a medium-sized stone, which in turn was covered by more charcoal (F27). These deposits sat against a straight-sided cut. The southern edge of feature F88 only was visible as a profile or cross-section in the north section of the site as it was cut into a feature (F54) associated with the earlier phase of metalworking (phase IV). It was clearly associated with, and part of, the hearth and the other metalworking activities. Towards the east of the hearth area the charcoal (Fig. 8, F27) was covered by a deposit of soft, loose, friable yellow-brown material (Fig. 8, F25) This had an ash content and charcoal flecks and some stones It contained animal bones and slag and may simply have been dumped over the hearth area when the latter fell out of use. The charcoal (F27) extended southwards from the hearth where it covered a hollowed-out channel or linear depression (Fig. 10, F27B) running in an east-west direction. The base of the channel sloped down gently towards the east and extended as far as cut F39 (Fig. 10, see below). The north side of this channel was blackened with charcoal and compacted from burning, and frequent lumps of slag</page><page sequence="24">90 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy occurred on either slope of the depression The general charcoal spread (F27) to the north of this channel also contained slag, 5.5kg in total, together with vitrified and burnt clay. The channel (F27B) had 1kg of slag. Both deposits contained a total of two sherds of medieval pottery. A small, rounded feature (Fig. 10, F39), 0.88m east-west by 0.60m north-south by 0.4m deep, tapering to a point at the west, lay immediately to the east of the channel (F27B). The base of the feature was also slightly rounded, giving the cut a scooped-out appearance. It was filled with very pure, cohesive, bright yellow clay that was very unlike any of the surrounding deposits and must presumably have been a deliberate backfill. The cut was apparently contemporary with the hearth (F31) and associated metalworking activities. Two other features that may relate to the same activities were the small cuts and fills F42 and F47 (Fig. 10). The small, very round, shallow cut with a flat base (F42) measured 0.6m east-west by 0.53m north-south by 0.07m deep. It contained a charcoal and slag fill possibly derived from the overlying charcoal (F27). Another small, three-sided trapezoidal cut (F47), with its point facing towards the west, measured 0.38m east-west by 0.3m north-south. The sides sloped down gently to form a small, elongated, rounded base. The fill was also black charcoal and slag. Both these features lay to the south of the hearth and were earlier than the charcoal spread (F27). It is possible that they were associated with the same activities as those connected with the hearth, and were simply covered over and backfilled with the residual charcoal and slag (F27). A poorly defined depression (F34), 0.18-0.2m deep, containing a soft mid-brown fill with an ash content, also lay below the charcoal (F27). The sequence of stratigraphy observed in this area of the site was mirrored in the extreme north-west corner, where only a tiny fraction, 1.4m east-west by 0.35-0.5m north-south, of the layers survived post-medieval disturbance. A thin layer of red ash and charcoal (Fig. 8, F98) probably related to the general burning activities associated with the hearth. This occurred below a layer of ashy, silty clay containing charcoal flecks (Fig. 8, F97). This deposit seems to relate to some sort of channel or chute (Fig. 8, F199) visible in the north section face. This channel, which was cut away immediately to the south of the section face, contained a fill with frequent flecks and pieces of charcoal, frequent animal bone, occasional shell fragments and a large lump of slag. It appeared to underlie and be cut into by the hearth (F31) and charcoal (F27). At the extreme western edge of the site the remains of a pit occurred (Fig. 10, F41 and F46), which had been cut away by the post-medieval feature Fll (Fig. 10). This pit, which was not fully excavated, was found to be over lm deep and between 1.22 and 1.6m wide. The various fills contained dense charcoal in places. The lowest fill consisted of a deposit of pure charcoal. The north-south cross section through the pit revealed that there had been various recuts at the top of the pit. One of these recuts had a band of dense charcoal at the base of the depression, and it is possible that the upper portion of the pit was dug into to create hollows either for metalworking or for the dumping of material associated with the metalworking. Slag was retrieved from the fill (F46). South-west of site. The uppermost medieval levels in the south-west corner of the site again occurred in isolation from the rest of the site, as the post-medieval feature F9 (Fig. 10) had cut away all the medieval stratigraphy to the east of the area,</page><page sequence="25">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial. Bride Street, Dublin 91 leaving only a narrow strip, c. 1.4-1.8m wide, to the west of this. It would appear that the main activity was again metalworking. Here there were four rounded cuts, which had rounded bases and were between 0.7 and 0.84m in diameter. To the north-west of feature F9 a small feature (F45), measuring 0.76m north-south by a minimum of 0.64m east-west, contained ash and charcoal together with occasional crushed mussel shell and animal bone 5.5kg of slag occurred and included the remains of a furnace bottom (1162) and small pieces of vitrified and burnt clay. The fill appeared to have been material with a rubbish content that was dumped into a hollow or cut. This small cut may originally have been a hollow for metalworking, which was later backfilled. A small lense of soft ash and slag (F53) occurred below the hollow (F45) and spread to the south of it. A second hollow beneath the latter represented a similar cut and backfilling (F45A). A similar rounded depression and fill occurred below this (Fig. 10, F65). The fill consisted of a light-yellow-brown, greasy, pliable clay (putty-like) with occasional charcoal smears, sitting in the central base portion of the cut, with soft, loose, grey-brown material containing frequent charcoal flecks and pieces on either side of it. The reasonably pure-looking clay, which must have been deliberately used as a backfill in the depression here, is similar to the clays found in other depressions (F39, see above), which were also associated with metalworking. Another hollow containing a light-brown cohesive clay fill (F70), with frequent charcoal and fragments of wood, was revealed below F65. A large piece of slag, which crumbled on removal, was retrieved. This may also have been the remains of a furnace bottom. Further burning was represented by a lense of brown ash (F77). The lowest fill consisted of grey clay (F73), which became increasingly charcoal-flecked and very black towards the base and which also contained 0.75kg of slag. Some fish vertebrae occurred in this deposit at the south side of the feature. These may have been simply dumped here or may have been burnt with the wood used for the putative furnaces. The layers to the south of these features were grey silty clays with a rubbish content that also contained slag. Phase V?Interpretation and discussion The marked demarcation between the east and west of the site continued during this phase, with 'garden-type' soils predominant in the east and silty, uncultivated clays and metalworking in the west. Metalworking activities The deposits excavated in the north-west of the site represent a continuation of in situ metalworking. The slag exhibited traces of both blue-green and red, indicat ing that it was the residue from both copperworking and ironworking. The hearth (Fig. 10, F31) was associated with a large deposit of charcoal and slag and with a linear, channel-type feature (F27B) that had the appearance of a chute of some type. The compaction and burning of the sides of this feature indicated that it had been exposed to heat, and a good deal of slag adhered to the sides of it, suggesting that it had some function within the metalworking process. It may have acted as a run-off for molten metal, hence also the slope to the east towards a small rounded feature (F39). It is reasonably similar in appearance to</page><page sequence="26">92 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy the channels found within 'the forge' at Baysdale, North Yorkshire, dated to the early fourteenth century (Crossley 1981, 30, 32). The Baysdale features were somewhat larger, but the Bride Street channel may simply represent metalworking on a smaller scale. The round feature (F39) may have had a similar function to the round cuts found at the end of the channel at Baysdale. Slag was apparently tapped into them from the channel. The pure yellow clay that occurred in this cut and also in cut F65 may have been used to make or repair tuy?res or to line furnace pits as suggested by Fanning (1981, 107). The bright red deposits of ash in the vicinity of the hearth might be from the fires used in the smelting and roasting of ores, or they may simply be the burnt waste from fires and furnaces used in the smelting or the manufacturing of metal objects. The other small depressions must also have had some function associated with metalworking, such as furnaces, but their purpose was unclear. A small, linear, slot-shaped feature within the charcoal spread (F27), with an east-west orientation, could possibly have been the setting for the nozzle of a bellows. The square-shaped feature (Fig. 8, F19) may have been the remains of a base or setting for an overlying feature also associated with metalworking. This, how ever, is very speculative without further evidence. The most obvious interpretation for the small, rounded features at the south west corner of the site, which had been cut and re?ut, is again that these are smelting furnaces, which were then backfilled or partially covered and then re?ut as necessary. They would seem too small to have been of much use in the dumping and burning of rubbish, and the occurrence of slag and ash would seem to confirm their metalworking association. The deposits of ash, charcoal and slag within the features and layers to the north and south must all be the residue from burning associated with the heating of ores or metals. From the associated finds it would appear that these intensive copperworking and ironworking activities were being carried on in the thirteenth century. The finds Approximately 1,475 small finds were recovered from the excavation. All finds were fully catalogued and given the site prefix, followed by their catalogue number and the feature or context number in parentheses, for example, 93E153:64(6). The following finds are described by their catalogue and feature number only. Medieval pottery A total of 749 sherds of medieval pottery were recovered from the site. The excavation assemblage is similar to that found at other excavated Dublin medieval sites (Barton 1988; McMahon 1988, 291-4, McMahon 1991, 56-9; Simpson 1995; and Walsh 1997), and detailed fabric descriptions are given in these and other publications (Barton 1963; Sweetman 1984; Vmce 1988). The assemblage was too fragmentary to facilitate the identification of vessel types; however, the bulk of the sherds are most likely from jugs or cooking pots. The assemblage was sorted into groups and counted, and an estimate was made of the vessel numbers present (Table 1).</page><page sequence="27">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial. Bride Street, Dublin 93 Table 1?Bride Street assemblage by sherd count. Group Sherds Percentage English 188 25% French 97 13% Local (Dublin/Lemster) 464 62% Total sherds 749 No pottery was recovered from phases I, II or III, which have been dated to between the eighth and eleventh centuries, placing them m an Early Medieval context. A total of 64 sherds were recovered from phase 3V, while 506 sherds were associated with phase V (Table 2). Both phase IV and phase V have been tentatively dated to the thirteenth century, based on the pottery recovered, although using pottery as a dating tool is fraught with dangers (Clarke 1984, 159). Although 179 sherds came from the post-medieval deposits, this can be accounted for by disturbance of medieval deposits by later activity. Imported ware The imported ware from England and France constitutes 38% of the total assemblage. The English ware (Table 3), which constitutes 25% of the total pottery assemblage, was imported from the general Bristol area, except for one sherd from Chester. The French imports (Table 4), constituting 13% of the pottery assemblage, are from the Saintonge area of south-west France, from an unknown production centre in northern France, from Rouen and from Normandy. South-east Wiltshire ware (Fig. 14). This ware, which is found widely distributed m South England, has also been found on other excavations in Dublin (Simpson 1995, 41; Walsh 1997, 109, 126) and Waterford (Gahan and McCutcheon 1997, 292-3). The fabric, which has been described by Vince (1988, 264), is pale to mid-grey and has a characteristic pimply texture. The glaze is a thin, pale yellow-green. It has been dated to the eleventh century in England but it was thought not to have been exported to Ireland until the second half of the twelfth century (Vince 1988, 264). Recent excavations at St Audoen's church, Dublin (McMahon 1994, 60), and in Waterford (Gahan and McCutcheon 1997, 293) indicate that it was being imported into Ireland from at least the early twelfth century.

Minety ware (not illustrated). The source of this ware is thought to be the Minety area of north Wiltshire (Vince 1988, 262). Fabric is fired to a mid/dark grey, with limestone tempering that burnt out leaving a typical pitted interior surface. Thin, dull olive-green glaze. This ware was found in Bristol Castle in contexts dated to between 1123 and 1133 (Ponsford 1991, 84-5). Ham Green glazed and cooking ware (Figs 14 and 15). This ware forms a considerable proportion of the imported medieval pottery from the excavation at Bride Street. It accounted for almost half (49%) of the imported ware, and 18% of the total assemblage. The ware from the Ham Green kiln near Bristol has been described first by Barton (1963) and more recently by Ponsford (1991, 98). Both cooking pots and glazed jugs were produced. Based on minor differences in fabric and vessel morphology, the glazed ware is divided into 'A' and 'B' groups. At Bride Street the bulk of the ware was Ham Green 'A'. A revised dating sequence has been put forward for this ware. Ponsford (1991, 98) suggests that the 'A' ware can be dated to c. AD 1120-1160 and the 'B' ware to Table 4?French wares by group (numbers in parentheses = minimum vessel count).

These four body sherds include one sherd of south-west English cooking ware. This ware has been found m Dublin at Bridge Street Lower (McMahon 1991, 59) and at Dublin Castle (Papazian 1989, 38). It is almost completely oxidised and coarsely tempered. Evidence from High Street, Dublin, suggests a possible mid-twelfth- to early thirteenth-century date range (C. Papazian, pers, comm.).

In Ireland it indicates a continuation of the Bristol ceramic trade into at least the fourteenth century. Chester ware (not illustrated). One sherd was found m a phase V context. This pottery has been found in other Dublin excavations and in Drogheda (Sweetman 1984, 183). The oxidised fabric is sandy, with quartz and small, dark stone inclusions. It has a suggested date range between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, although it is largely absent in Chester from contexts with suggested fourteenth century dates (C. Papazian, pers. comm.). Normandy ware (Fig. 16). Fabric is white, slightly micaceous, with occasional quartz inclusions. Some sherds have vertical dribbles of red paint on their outer face. Similar ware was found at St Audoen's church from twelfth-century levels (McMahon 1994). Fig. 16. 851(98): Off-white, buff-coloured body sherd with infrequent quartz inclusions, pitted surface. Decorated with two vertically applied lines of red paint, together with roller-stamped decoration above an incised, wavy horizontal line. Found in a deposit of ash and charcoal associated with hearth F31 (Fig. 10)?phase V. Rouen ware (not illustrated). Sandy, micaceous fabric fired to a white to pale buff colour. The glazing and decoration is quite distinctive. Rouen ware is found in</page><page sequence="30">96 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy London from the late twelfth century, and the mid- to late thirteenth century has been suggested as a terminal date for this ware (Allan 1983, 198). North French ware (not illustrated). Off-white to buff, sandy, micaceous fabric with glossy green glaze. Saintonge ware (Fig. 16). This is the commonest French import found in Dublin, where, according to Barton, who was looking at pottery from Winetavern Street and Christchurch Place, it ranks third m the quantity of ceramics found (Barton 1988, 288). At Bride Street, however, it accounts for only 7% of the total assemblage and 18% of the imported pottery. The fabric is fine, micaceous, off-white, occasionally pink, with quartz inclusions. The ware is grouped as follows: (i) Green-glazed. This glaze has a mottled effect. The vessels are usually tall jugs with flat bases, strap handles and parrot-beak applied bridge spouts. (ii) Unglazed. No glaze or decoration was added to these vessels. (m) Polychrome. This type was painted, usually with stylised birds or heraldic motifs. Saintonge ware was being imported into Britain and Ireland in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Gahan and McCutcheon 1997, 316-18; Hurst 1988, 237-8; Allan 1983, 199). It has been found in some Dublin city excavations in thirteenth-century contexts (Hurst 1988, 231-2, 242-53). Polychrome ware has been closely dated to the late thirteenth/early fourteenth century (Dunning 1968, 45; Allan 1983, 200-1). Fig. 16: 843(92): This is a sherd of a Saintonge green-glazed jar with a simple rolled rim. Found in a clay deposit in the east of the site?phase IV. Dublin and native ware Local ware (see Table 5) constitutes 62% of the total assemblage. The nomen clature used by Papazian for the medieval pottery recovered from the Dublin Castle excavations (Papazian 1989) has recently been revised (McCutcheon 2000). However, for the purposes of consistency with other Dublin excavations reports published within the last ten years (McMahon 1991, 56-9; Simpson 1995, 48-52; Walsh 1997, 109-23), the Papazian terminology has also been used in this report.

This pottery has also been found at other Dublin sites including Bridge Street (McMahon 1991, 56-7), High Street, Back Lane and Patrick, Nicholas and Winetavern Streets (Walsh 1997, 114, 127). It has a hard, oxidised fabric with a grey core and inclusions that are granitic in origin; it can be glazed or unglazed. Dublin Castle evidence suggested a thirteenth-century date (Papazian 1989, 65), but at High Street (C. Papazian, pers. comm.) it was found in contexts dated to the late twelfth century. Fig. 16' 1106(22): Rim-spout (parrot-beak type). The spout is applied and thumbed to look like a frill. A broken appliqu? on the spout may have been anthropomorphic. Orange inner face, grey core, orange-green glaze, little mica. Found in 'garden-type' soil to the east of the site?phase V. Fig. 16: 829(84): Body sherd, orange inner face, orange-grey core, green glaze. Large mica plates visible on inner face. Decorated with square-shaped rouletting. Found in pit fill at the west of the site?phase V. Dublin glazed ware (fabric 002) (Fig. 16). This ware amounted to 24% of the total assemblage and 38% of the local ware. These are wheel-thrown vessels with a fabric similar to fabric 004 but more moderately tempered (McMahon 1991, 58). A white slip was applied prior to glazing on many of the sherds. It has been suggested that, as this pottery is wheel-thrown, it may be slightly later in date than the coarser hand-built ware (McCutcheon 2000, 122). It has been found in a late thirteenth/early fourteenth-century context in Dublin (McMahon 1988, 279, 285, 293, 311). Ftg. 16: 649(13): Rim sherd from a bowl. Internally glazed. Burning on outer, unglazed face. The flat rim is pierced. Found in 'garden-type' soil to the east of the site?phase V. Dublin temper-free ware (fabric 003) (not illustrated). This ware made up only 4% of the total assemblage and 7% of the local ware Found in other Dublin excavations including Bridge Street Lower (McMahon 1991, 58) and Dublin Castle (Papazian 1989, 146). At Dublin Castle evidence suggests a thirteenth-century date with a suspected late continuation into the fifteenth century. The ware is completely oxidised with a sparsity of deliberately added inclusions. Lemster cooking ware (fabric 001) (not illustrated). This ware accounted for 7% of the total assemblage and 12% of the local ware. The fabric is typically creamy buff with many quartz, calcite and mica inclusions (O Floinn 1988). This pottery was being produced from the late twelfth century, and at Dublin Castle the ware was found in contexts dating from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century. Roof tiles2 This assemblage includes 116 sherds of roof tile. Of these, 93% are from curved roof tiles, 6% are from pantiles and one sherd comes from a medieval crested ridge tile. The tiles were identified and then weighed as the most accurate way of Report by Joanna Wren</page><page sequence="32">98 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy assessing the quantities deposited in each feature. They were then dated on the basis of contextual and typological information from this site and others known to the writer. The descriptions were ordered chronologically. Curved roof tiles There are 108 sherds from clay roof tiles. These tiles were used on the roof ridge or in combination with flanged tiles on the body of the roof. The flat, flanged tiles were placed on the roof with their flanges facing upwards. The curved tiles were then fitted over the flanges joining two neighbouring tiles together. No flanged tiles were found at this site, but they are known from other sites in Dublin, including St Audoen's Church, Cornmarket (McMahon, forthcoming). All of these tiles were made in the same soft, rough earthenware fabric. This was completely fired to buff. Inclusions were sparse and well below 1mm in size. Thm-section analysis of a sample of the tiles from contexts of varying dates showed them all to be made in the one fabric and probably dating to the one period. The majority (81%) of these tiles come from contexts that contained pottery dating to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; 15% are from post-medieval layers; 6% are from contexts associated with phases II and III. Burials from phase III have a radiocarbon date range from the early eighth century to the end of the tenth century. Tiles with this form and fabric occur in contexts throughout Dublin, with a date range from the early eleventh century (P. Wallace, pers. comm.) to the thirteenth century, and they were probably in use during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Similar tiles were found in early eleventh-century contexts in York (S. Garside-Neville, pers. comm.). It seems likely that the small percentage from the early phases in Bride Street were deposited at the later end of the date range for these contexts. Crested medieval ridge tile One sherd of crested medieval ridge tile (305(8)) was found in a thirteenth-century context, phase V. It was made in a local Dublin fabric (DT2), which has been identified previously (Walsh 1997,149-52) and thin-sectioned (Walsh 1997,153-4). Tiles made in this fabric usually date to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Copper alloy objects Stick pins (Fig. 17) Twelve copper alloy stick pins were recovered from the excavation, two of which (32(5) and 528(74)) have only remains of the shanks surviving. O'Rahilly has classified stick pins from Dublin excavations according to the shape of their heads, for example, club-headed (O'Rahilly 1998, fig. 2). The Bride Street pins have a late eleventh-century to late thirteenth-century date range (O'Rahilly 1998, fig. 21).

Buckle (Fig. 17) Fig. 17: 57(22): A small, decorative, strap-end buckle consisting of a buckle frame, 16mm in diameter, and plate, 27mm long, tapering to a point. The frame and plate were cast as a single piece. A hole centrally placed at the ring-end of the plate accommodates a pin that is inserted through and bent back around the hole to secure it in place. There are two rivets on the plate with corresponding clinch plates on the underside of the buckle which secured it to some material, one or two fibres of which survived on the rivets under the clinch plates. A similar buckle with the frame and plate cast together was excavated at Grenstein in Norfolk (Goodall 1981, 67, fig. 66.1), but it is of uncertain date. Other examples with the frame and plate cast separately have been dated as early as the thirteenth century (Goodall 1981, 67). The Bride Street buckle, however, was found in 'garden-type' soil at the east of the site, which has a twelfth- to thirteenth-century date?phase V Cham (Fig 17) Fig 17: 397B(52): Two short lengths of chain (29mm and 27mm respectively) with S-shaped links.

Four miscellaneous copper alloy fragments were also found including two strands of copper wire, which were twisted together, measuring 18mm long by 2mm wide (257(35)). Barrel Padlocks3 (Fig. 18) Two barrel padlocks were recovered from Bride Street. One (436(7)) is a padlock case made of copper alloy and is Type Id (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 23). The other (400(58)) is a case with the remains of the bolt with the barb-spring corroded into it. It is bimetallic, copper alloy and iron, and is a Type 4b (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 42). It has wood corroded on to it The basic technology for barrel padlocks is the same whatever the size, use or date (from the Iron Age on) of the object. The security comes from the expansion of barbs on a spine within the case, rendering it incapable of being released until the barbs are compressed by the barrel padlock key. The object to be secured is held by the hasp, which is an arm attached rigidly to a plate on top of the padlock case in Type Id. In Type 4b the C-shaped hasp is on a separate bolt and engages into a tube which is attached to the top of the case by a fin. Fig 18: 436(7): This padlock case is a very small and delicate artefact, only 27mm long, the smallest example found so far in Ireland. It is hexagonal in section with a diameter of 10mm. There is a rectangular cut-out measuring 6mm by 4mm on top of the case at the bolt end where the bolt would engage the case. The tapering arm-hasp, length 29.7mm, is oval sectioned, measures 4mm by 3.5mm and extends slightly beyond the case. It sits on a plate, 7mm by 5mm by 3mm at the key end. The bolt to this tiny padlock would have held two barb-springs, since there is a horizontal plate inside the case to separate them. These springs would have sat at right angles on a bolt plate c. 25mm long, under 10mm wide, with an aperture at one end to engage the hasp. The irregularly shaped keyhole, c. 6mm by 5mm, is at the opposite end to the hasp, and the key would have been very small with two cut-outs m it to compress the springs. The Bride Street Type Id padlock came from a disturbed context with medieval and post-medieval finds. However, this type has good parallels in Eng land dating from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century and they have been recovered from these contexts in Ireland. An example comes from Rathmullan, Co. Down (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 23-4), and two come from Waterford city (Donaghy 1997, 530, 534, fig. 15: 24.4 and 24.6). These cases are 44mm, 39mm and 34mm long?larger than the Bride Street example Three bolts for this type of padlock have also been recovered in Ireland. Two are stray finds, one from Report by Caroline Donaghy</page><page sequence="35">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 101 Christchurch Place/Fishamble Street in Dublin and the other from Dunbell, Co. Kilkenny. These bolts would have fitted the above or slightly larger padlocks but not the tiny Bride Street artefact. The third Type Id bolt in Ireland came from medieval levels at Carnckfergus, Co. Antrim, and would have come from a larger padlock than the previous examples, probably from a padlock case c. 80-100mm long. The remarkable feature of this padlock is its small size. The barb-springs on the bolt must have been extremely delicate, a mere c. 10mm by 2mm by 0.5mm, making its use very limited if it was a lock and not a toy. The only smaller example from Britain or Ireland is a gold barrel padlock brooch, 15mm long, found in a medieval gold jewellery hoard at Fishpool in Nottinghamshire (Cherry 1973, 312, pi. LXXXVLd), which had a decorative function only and was incapable of locking. A use for the Bride Street example could have been to lock a very small box, or more likely a leather or wooden book cover. A slightly larger example, 35mm long, was recovered from Greyfriars Friary at Northampton (Williams 1978, fig. 22:2), where it may have secured an ecclesiastic book. Fig. 18: 400(58): This is a Type 4b barrel padlock. The Type 4 padlocks have parallels in England dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, and the examples from Ireland are from the same period. The Irish Type 4 padlocks are sub-divided a-c on the form of the key hole (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 12). In type 4b the keyhole sits at the bottom of the key plate and extends partly along the bottom of the case. Although this padlock is incomplete, enough remains to classify it. This padlock came from pit fill F58?phase V. The object is not well pre served. It is c. 55mm long, and the diameter of the copper alloy case, half of which is missing, is c. 22mm. The case has a metal strap moulding for strengthening and/or decoration around it at the key end. The keyhole can be seen as a cut-out 9mm by 5mm at the bottom of the case at the key end. This would have extended a short way along the bottom of the case, but this area is now missing. The fin with the hasp tube, probably slightly longer than the case, sits along the top and is fairly complete except at the bolt end, where the case is heavily corroded with wood (possibly oak) and rust accretions. The fin, c. 5-6mm wide, is 2mm thick, and the tube tapers from the bolt end from diameter c. 8mm to c. 5mm. The remains of the iron bolt are evident m the single barb-spring, which is corroded into the case. The springs are 40mm long. Type 4 padlocks have a separate U-shaped bolt with the arm-hasp as one arm and the barb-spring or springs as the other. The actual locking area of the hasp is the curve of the U, the part of the arm-hasp left out after it is pushed home into the hasp tube on the case and the barb-spring is engaged in the case. The wood, which is preserved by corrosion at the bolt end of this padlock, indicates that it was used to lock a door or perhaps a shutter or chest. The Type 4 padlocks come from twelfth- to fourteenth-century contexts in Ireland, where twelve examples have been found (Donaghy 1991, vol. 2, 105) including four Type 4b padlocks (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 40) An iron case with deep lateral grooves came from the Priory at Armagh, length c. 70mm, diameter c. 30mm. Another iron case with three convex ribs attached to it and moulding at both ends, length 65mm, diameter 30mm, is a stray find from Francis Street in Dublin (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 40). The above padlocks would have had a triple</page><page sequence="36">102 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy barb-spring bolt. An iron example from Waterford dating to the second half of the twelfth century had metal straps around the case and would have had a dual barb-spring bolt, length 53mm, diameter 30mm. A fragmented copper alloy example was recovered from a house at Temple-na-Skellig, Glendalough, Co. Wicklow, length c. 60mm (Donaghy 1991, vol. 1, 41). The two barrel padlocks, Type Id and 4b, fit well into the sequence of these artefacts found in medieval Ireland from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, and the origins can be seen in Norman England. However, 436(7) is outstanding in its small size and fine workmanship. The exceptional size also aids in interpret ing its use, possibly on a book shrine. The same is true to a certain extent with the wood corroded on to the other padlock, 400(58), indicating security of a door, window or chest. The use of padlocks implies control over people and/or property, and even the very small padlock would restrict access to the book it was locking. Iron Ringed Pin (not illustrated) Although this pin was very corroded, an X-ray revealed that 577(105) is a plain-ring, loop-headed pin. Length 113mm, ring 13mm diameter, shank 3mm diameter tapering to a point. Ringed pins, which would have been used as simple dress fasteners, are a frequent find on crannogs, ringforts and monastic sites (Fanning 1974/5, 212). They were popular in Ireland from the eighth century (Fanning 1994, 16, 53). This variety is the commonest type found in Ireland and it is also the commonest type made of iron. The form was adopted by the Norse settlers. Large numbers have been found in the Dublin excavations associated with the tenth- and eleventh-century levels (Fanning 1994, 17, 53). The Bride Street pin was found in a clay deposit that also contained some slag, indicating metalworking in the vicinity?phase III. Knives (not illustrated) 132(5) is part of the corroded blade of a knife. The blade has a thin triangular section. Where it narrows towards the tang it is rounded, very similar in appear ance to knives of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Fanning 1976, fig. 11: nos 131, 150 and 221). Length 55mm, width 16mm, thickness 2mm. Found in a post-medieval pit. Although 1153(18) is heavily corroded, it appears to be part of the blade of a knife, length 65mm, width 20mm. Found in silty clay to the west of the site?phase V. Toilet implement (Fig. 18) Fig. 18: 582(84): This object, which is semi-circular in shape, is hooked at one end and flattens into a spatula-like object at the other. Its fine nature suggests that it had a cosmetic use as a dual-purpose toilet implement. The spatulate end may have functioned as a scraper, perhaps to scrape oil off the skin, and the hook could have been used for example as an earwax scoop, or to perform some other personal function. Being iron, this implement is unusual in that these objects were</page><page sequence="37">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial' Bride Street, Dublin 103 more generally made of copper alloy (Egan and Pritchard 1991, 337). A similar toilet implement was excavated at Essex Street West, Dublin (Simpson 1995, 75, fig. 26:5), in a late twelfth- to late thirteenth-century context. Found m pit fill at the west of the site?phase V. Key (not illustrated) 131(5) is a heavily corroded doorkey, of which only the bow and 40mm of the stem survive. The bow is kidney-shaped, 38mm wide, similar to one illustrated by Fanning (1976, 134-5, fig. 12:117) although smaller It belongs to type VIIA and dates to the fifteenth century (London Museum 1967, 142, pi. XXXI, fig. 43:8 and 9). Found in a post-medieval pit. Nails (not illustrated) Sixteen nails, including one with a clench plate, were found. The heads varied from 15mm to 30mm m width. Shanks were from 30mm to 90mm in length. The clinker-type nail (1236(8)) had a head 40mm wide, shank 35mm long and a 20mm wide clench plate. This type of nail was used in ship or boat building (McGrail and Denford 1982, 38, fig. 3.14, and ? R?ord?in 1971, 82, fig. 24). It was found in 'garden-type' soil at the east of the site?phase V. Tools and other miscellaneous objects (not illustrated) 563(47) is a heavily corroded iron rod-like object (chisel?). Length 140mm, c. 12mm in diameter at centre, widens and flattens towards one end to 23mm wide. It was found in a pit at the west of the site?phase IV. 1160(34) is a socketed handle. Dimensions after being X-rayed are: length 55mm, width 30mm tapering to 25mm. It was found in a deposit associated with metalworking?phase V. 563(47) could be a wall hook or spike. It appears to have a circular section at its widest end (25mm in diameter), flattening towards a rounded narrower end (10mm in diameter). Found in a deposit also associated with metalworking?phase V. 1158(54) is possibly a hook, hook 17mm and shank 3mm. It was found in a pit ?phase IV. Iron smelting finds (not illustrated) There was much evidence for metalworking from the site, in particular the north-west corner. Fragments of burnt clay found associated with slag are probably the remains of tuy?res or furnace lining. 1162(45) and 1163(82) are fragments of two furnace bottoms, measuring respectively 90mm by 50mm and 110mm by 80mm. Both were found in furnace pits?phases IV and V. 545(28) is the remains of a tuy?re fragment. It is composed of the clay tuy?re on one side with slag accretions on the other. However, no perforation or nozzle feature was apparent. Found in 'garden-type' soil at the east of the site?phase V. Coins (not illustrated) 58(22) is a silver coin. On excavation it was possible to make out a helmeted bust in profile; the reverse was unidentifiable. However, conservation did not improve</page><page sequence="38">104 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy the clarity. A possible comparison prior to conservation was made with a Hiberno Norse coin dated between AD 1065 and 1095 (Seaby 1970, 17, no. 4151). Found in 'garden-type' soil in the east of the site?phase V. 237(27) is an unidentifiable silver com, 17mm in diameter.

Found in silty clay in the west of the site?phase V. 551(22) was 22mm long by 20mm wide. Found in 'garden-type' soil in the east of the site?phase V. Bone (Fig. 18) Fig. 18: 550(22): This object is a polished piece of cut bone (broken in half), c 30mm in diameter. It was probably used as a gaming piece. Found in 'garden-type' soil in the east of the site?phase V. Glass (not illustrated) 578(103) was a tiny, circular, dark blue(?) glass bead, 3mm in diameter with a perforation visible only at one end, very similar in size to one excavated at Reask, Co. Kerry (Fanning 1981, 121, fig. 19:144). Unfortunately the bead disintegrated between the excavation site and the conservation laboratory. Found in a deposit associated with the metalworking activities at the north-west of the site?phase IV.

A further one-litre sub sample was examined from sample 33 (F126). With regard to the remainder of the samples it was decided that further examination was unlikely to yield significant results, and no more material was processed. The samples were soaked and disaggregated in warm water. They were passed over stacked Endecotts sieves (2mm, 1mm, 0.5mm, 0.3mm). The retent from each sieve was examined using a binocular microscope. The term 'seed' is used in a general sense to mean the fruiting bodies of plants. Results The samples contained little or no organic material. Plant remains were poorly preserved, and most of what little remained was charred. All of the samples contained food waste. The samples examined from pit fill contexts all contained evidence of food remains, both charred and uncharred, in keeping with the use of pits for the disposal of household refuse, including hearth debris.</page><page sequence="43">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 109 Phase I Sample 33?refuse spread (Fl 26) Sample 38?pit fill (F135) Phase II Sample 30 (F115) -pit fill In total, 1.5 litres of material was processed. Fragments of charcoal, mussel shell and bone in the sample indicated human activity and probably the dumping of domestic refuse. Charred apple pips, charred hazelnut shell fragments, possibly one charred grain of wheat (cf. Tnticum sp.), one charred oat grain {Avena sp.) and charcoal were present. Blackberry seeds (Rubus sp.), mussel shell fragments and fish bone, all of which were uncharred, were also present. Charcoal, bone, fish bone and a small number of poorly preserved faecal concretions were present. A fragment of bone was embedded into one of the concretions. Microscopic examination of the faecal material showed that no plant remains were present. Charcoal, bone, fish bone, possibly barley (cf. Hordeum sp.? 1 charred grain) and two uncharred seeds, one of sedge (Carex sp.) and the other of knotgrass (Polygonum aviculare), were present. Both sedge and knotgrass could have been growing in the vicinity of the site at that time and their seeds incorporated into the deposit.

Three charred grains of wheat (Tnticum sp.), charcoal, fragments of bone, fish bone, mussel shell and four uncharred seeds of elder (Sambucus niger) were also present. The charcoal and charred cereal grains could represent hearth debris. No chaff or cereal weeds, indicative of crop processing material, were present, and the cereal grains might simply represent waste or leftover grain tossed onto the fire. The bone, mussel shell and elder seeds were unburnt. Elder could have been eaten?although it is something of a weed in hedgerows and on banks, and its presence in the pit was not necessarily evidence that the fruits were eaten.</page><page sequence="45">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 111 Appendix II Radiocarbon dating summary Queen's University of Belfast, Radiocarbon Research Laboratory Field identification no.

Louth Introduction These skeletons were not examined m situ but were analysed post-excavation. They consisted of two articulated individuals, which, although disturbed, were in a good state of preservation. There was also a minimum of two other individuals present from the disarticulated bone found on the site. The burials consisted of an older female and an adolescent aged between sixteen and twenty years at the time of death. One of the disarticulated individuals was a young adult and one was a child. Since it was not possible to draw any conclusions about the population from so few individuals, the burials are merely described separately below, along with any pathology noted. Living stature of the burials was estimated using the regres sion equations of Trotter and Gleser (1952; 1958). Summary of pathology There was evidence for nutritional deficiency or acute infections in the early childhood of the two burials. There was also evidence for vitamin deficiency in the young adult from the disarticulated remains. The older female had suffered from periodontitis (gum disease), linked to heavy calculus deposits, and also had heavy wear on her anterior teeth. This individual also had degenerative joint disease (DJD) in the spine and ribs. Although there are many factors involved in the development of DJD, it does tend to get more severe with advancing age. Description of burials F86?Older adult, female. 166cm This was an almost complete female skeleton The cranium was virtually complete but broken, and the vertebral column was complete with seven cervical, twelve thoracic and five lumbar vertebrae. There were twelve pairs of ribs, and the manubrium and body of the sternum were present. Both clavicles and scapulae and all the bones of the left arm were complete, but only the proximal half of the right hum?rus remained from the right arm. The left capitate, lunate, scaphoid, trapezium and trapezoid remained from the hand bones, as well as all the left metacarpals and the right first and second metacarpals. There were seven proxi mal and five middle hand phalanges present. The pelvis, consisting of left and right ilia, ischia and pubes, as well as the sacrum, was complete. The proximal half of a left femur, a complete right tibia and an almost complete right fibula were labelled F87 but were considered to be part of this</page><page sequence="47">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial Bride Street, Dublin 113 skeleton. The left tibia was also present and complete, and the left fibula was virtually complete. Skeletal pathology. This individual had a noticeably thickened skull, particularly the right parietal bone and the right side of the frontal bone. The thickening was caused by expansion of the diploe rather than by any changes in the outer or inner table. The cause of the thickening is unknown: there is no porosity of the outer surface such as is found in porotic hyperostosis, and the changes do not appear to be consistent with Paget's disease. Osteoarthritis was observed in the posterior joints of the lower lumbar vertebrae. There was also degeneration of the cervical vertebrae, with the inferior surface of the body of C5 and the superior and inferior surfaces of C6 and C7 exhibiting pitting and porosity. There was mild osteophytosis of the lower cervical and the thoracic vertebrae and severe osteophy tosis in the fifth lumbar vertebrae and the upper surface of the sacrum. There was also osteoarthritis of the joint at the heads of the first and twelfth ribs on the right side and on the transverse joints of most of the middle ribs from both sides. Dental pathology. There was heavy attrition on the incisor teeth and moderate wear on the molar teeth. Calculus deposits were light on the buccal surfaces of the mandibular teeth and moderate on the lingual surfaces of all teeth except the right lower molars, where deposits were heavy. There was some slight alveolar recession around the roots of the mandibular molars, which is indicative of periodontal disease and which can be aggravated by heavy calculus deposits. Linear enamel hypoplasia, which can indicate nutritional deficiency or acute infection in childhood, was observed on the incisor teeth.

The skull consisted mainly of the occipital bone, both temporal bones and fragments of parietal bone. Only a small portion of the frontal bone, including the right orbital part, remained. The maxilla and mandible were also present. The vertebral column consisted of seven cervical, twelve thoracic and five lumbar vertebrae. There were twelve ribs, and the manubrium and part of the body of the sternum were also present. The right clavicle was complete, and the medial half of the left clavicle was present. Both scapulae were also present. All the arm bones were complete. The hand bones consisted of the right scaphoid, hamate and capitate, all the metacarpals and ten proximal, six middle and two distal phalanges. The right ilium and ischium and part of the pubis remained from the pelvis, as well as three sacral vertebrae. The right femur was complete, and the distal half of the left femur was present as well as both patellae. The shafts of both tibia and the right fibula were present.</page><page sequence="48">114 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Epiphyseal fusion The acetabulum was just fused and the epiphysis at the olecranon of the right ulna was fused, but all the other epiphyses of the long bones were unfused. Dental pathology. There was some overcrowding in the mandible, with the second left incisor displaced in front of the first incisor and canine. The left canine was rotated by almost 90?. Attrition was very slight. Calculus deposits were moderate on the lingual surfaces of the mandibular teeth and the buccal surfaces of the left maxillary teeth but were light on the remaining tooth surfaces. Linear enamel hypoplasia was observed on all the incisors, canines and premolars. The episodes occurred between the ages of two and five years.

The epiphyseal line on the proximal tibia was still clear, so the bone came from a young adult aged seventeen to twenty-five years. Pathology. Periostitis, an inflammation of the periosteum, the outer cover of the bone, was observed on the lateral surface of the tibia shaft and also on the medial and posterior surfaces near the distal end. Periostitis of the tibiae may be linked to a deficiency of vitamin C. F55 This consisted of a fragment of a right parietal bone from a child.

Of these fragments, 1,533 (49.85%) were unidentifiable to species level and consisted for the most part of rib blade, long bone shaft and miscellaneous vertebra fragments. The animal bone remains came from two broad chronological periods. Phases I?III spanned the eighth to the eleventh century and consisted of a total mammal bone count of 930 fragments, of which 411 were unidentifiable to species level. Phases IV-V were dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century and in total amounted to 2,072 mammal bone fragments, of which 1,122 could not be assigned to specific species. In addition, taking the two periods together, 36 bird and 37 fish bone fragments were also recovered (Table 1). Comparing the two overall assemblages, cattle, pig, sheep/goat and cat were common to both periods. In phases IV-V horse, dog and red deer were also present. Indirect evidence for the presence of dog during phases I-III consisted of tooth puncture marks on certain of the cattle long bone fragments. Cattle, which were of the shorthorn variety, dominated the bone counts, accounting, in phases I?III, for 435 (83.81%) of a total identifiable count of 519 and in phases IV-V for 716 (75.36%) of a total of 950 fragments. On fragment totals pig and sheep/goat followed in that order over both periods (Table 1). Quantification of the material per species into values of minimum number of individuals highlights the dominance of cattle (Table 2). However, due to the small size of the samples, and also taking into consideration the time span, it is impossible to draw any definitive conclusion as to the relative importance of each of the main meat-producing domesticates to the local economy or diet of the inhabitants of the site. Osteological research on much more extensive bone samples from several sites that lay within the confines of the walled medieval town of Dublin indicates that cattle were the primary meat providers from the tenth to the thirteenth century (Butler 1984, 34; Butler 1990, 28; McCormick 1982, 92).

It is obvious from the presence of chop and/or light cut marks on a high percentage of the bone fragments from both periods that the assemblages as a whole originated as discarded food refuse. Bone elements on which this evidence was apparent included skulls, mandibulae, vertebrae, ribs, scapulae, pelvis and certain of the long bones. The chop marks would have been inflicted by a heavy cleaver type implement during the sectioning of the animal carcasses, while the light cut marks, in some cases occurring in the form of a number of parallel lines, indicate the process of meat removal or boning. There was no evidence available to demonstrate the actual method(s) of slaughter. In the case of the cattle, evidence for sectioning was apparent on a number of the hum?rus and femur fragments. It was noted that the medial and lateral condyles of a number of the humeri distal fragments had been hacked through, a process that would have separated the upper from the lower front leg. In addition, the top of the caput of a number of the femora had been severed and would have resulted in the separating of the upper hind leg from the pelvic socket. Other femur heads were intact, however, so it is likely that dismembering was also achieved by inserting a thin, sharp-bladed knife into the pelvic socket and cutting the bone free. Similar sectioning techniques have been demonstrated at the sites mentioned above. No evidence for the sectioning of pig or sheep/goat carcasses was available. It would appear from the presence of a large number of the individual skeletal elements in the assemblages from both periods that the animals had been butchered and sectioned on the site itself or close by. The blackening on certain fragments indicates that following meat removal these bones had been thrown into a fire. This had caused heat fracturing of these particular specimens. The remains of a single horse were among the material from phases IV-V, but there was no evidence for the consumption of horse meat.</page><page sequence="51">McMahon ?Early medieval settlement and burial: Bride Street, Dublin 111 A bovine horncore from F120 and a female goat's horncore from F30/F36 had been severed by a number of blows directed to the skull. This material may be refuse from horn working. Evidence for this craft has been found on a number of sites including Fishamble Street, mid-tenth- to twelfth-century levels (McCormick 1982, 115), Parliament Street, eleventh- to thirteenth-century levels (Butler 1992, 2-4), Wood Quay and Bridge Street, both thirteenth-century levels (Butler 1984, 98-100; McMahon 1991, 67). Saw marks on the four off-cuts from phases IV-V indicate the exploitation and fashioning of red deer antler. Comparable material from the twelfth century is common to many bone samples from other Dublin city excavations including High Street and Winetavern Street (? R?ord?in 1971, 75).
