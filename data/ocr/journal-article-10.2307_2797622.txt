EMMANUEL ANATI In June, I96I, during our sixth research cam- 195 paign in the Camonica Valley (Province of Brescia, Northern Italy), we recorded a new monumental rock which brings fresh evidence on the chronology and the stylistic evolution of Camunian prehistoric art.'

SKETCH MAP OF THE CAMONICA VALLEY WITH LOCATION OF ROCK PICTURES The engraved rock in question had been known for years to the peasants who own the surrounding fields and is called by them roccia dei Corni Freschi, or 'rock of the fresh horns.' Mr. Anselmo Chimivelli guided Mrs. E. Anati, Mr. G. B. Mafessoli and myself to the spot. The rock stands in the field called 'della Hola Grande,' at the eastern foot of the stony hill of Monticolo, about one mile to the north * With PlateJ and two text figures of the village of Montecchio (Fraz. Darfo), at a height of about 230 metres above sea level. This is the fourth site in the Lower Camonica Valley at which rock pictures have been found,z the others being Boario,3 Borno 4 and Ossimo.5 The carvings face the south-east and are located at the intersection of the southern and eastern vertical surfaces of the 'Fresh Horns' rock. In front of them, a flat field extends to the Oglio river a few hundred metres further east.6 The rock pictures are very finely engraved, in dotting technique. The outlines are sharp and well designed, and the dots are tiny, uniform and regular. This technique is characteristic of several other monumental rocks in the Camonica Valley, in particular, of those at Borno,7 at Cemmo8 and at Paspardo. 9 to 20 30 t FIG. 2. CORNI FRESCHI ROCK CARVING The carvings, altogether about I20 cm. Iligh, represent nine halberds, in two vertical rows, six of them on the right and three on the left. In a later period, the blade of the halberd at the bottom left was altered by a cup-and- ring carving. The handles of the weapons are all slightly bent and are broader at the end, which in five cases appears to have a dot in the middle, probably showing that it was perforated. At the junction with the blade, it seems that an additional piece (perhaps of wood) was sometimes added, II3</page><page sequence="3">No. I95 MAN AUGUST, i962 perhaps as a decorative feature. All the blades are central- ribbed, and they all seem to belong to the same type, the type known from the Remedello Chalcolithic culture in the region, at Villafranca (Verona),Io and at Gambara (Brescia). I I In addition to these nine, we know of I9 other repre- sentations of halberds in the rock pictures of the Camonica Valley: I3 at Boario Terme, i at Borno, 3 at Nadro and 2 at Cemmo. But only one of them, that from Cemmo (unfortunately broken), 2 seems to show the same characters as these. However, the Corni Freschi halberds are the only ones known in the Camonica Valley to show the central rib. In the rock pictures of Mount Bego (French Maritime Alps), we have recorded 6o representations of halberds, but none is of the same type as these. Another, from an anthro- pomorphic slab found at Miandassa di Villar Perosa (Piemonte), is again of a different type, while two stelxe with figures of halberds from Teglio (Sondrio), again show different characters. The halberd persisted a long time in the Camonica Valley, and two main types of this weapon have been recognized. The first occurred in the second and the beginning of the third phase of Camunian art, and was tentatively dated to the first half of the second millennium B.C.; the second type, occurring only at the very end of phase IIIA and in phase IIIB of Val Camonica, was tenta- tively dated I500-I200 B.C.I3 Although it would seem that the halberds of Corni Freschi have affinities with the first type, they are not identical with it, and must be considered as a new and different type (probably contemporary with the first). In view of the strong similarities of these figures with the weapons of the Remedello Chalcolithic culture, it is likely that they date from before the end of the eighteenth century B.C.I4 The Corni Freschi rock picture is a well conceived composition, of the same type as the other monumental rocks of Val Camonica, from Paspardo,'I5 CemmoI6 and Borno.I7 In all these rock carvings, there are series of weapons arranged in two rows in a manner very similar to that found in this site. The same figurative concept is repeated also in the menhir statues from Alto Adige (Tyrol), where these weapons appear to be the attributes of many- handed idols, holding a weapon in each of their numerous hands.i8 At Corni Freschi the anthropomorphic figure is not depicted, but the arrangement of the weapons is the same as in the other monuments of the sort, and the rock picture is likely to represent the same figures which appear elsewhere in the Camonica Valley, and, in a more realistic form, in the Alto Adige. If this hypothesis is correct, we are faced here with a case of highly sophisticated, symbolic art, dating back before the middle of the seventeenth century B.C. The Corni Freschi is an unexpected discovery for another reason as well. All the other known engraved rocks of the same type from Val Camonica appear to date after the seventeenth century B.C.; this fact had led me to suggest that this kind of figurative approach began in this region towards i600 B.C.I9 The Corni Freschi shows that this date must now be put back, by at least one century. Notes 'The sixth campaign in the Camonica Valley was carried onl as part of a research project supported by the Bollingen Foundation of New York. 2 Most of the rock engravings were found in the Central Camonica Valley, only a few being recorded in the Upper and Lower parts of the valley (see map). 3 E.

I4 Considering that Polada must come after Remedello, and before the Terramara culture, this is the latest possible date for the end of Remedello. It is likely that the Remedello culture had a rather long existence. The few cases in which Bell Beakers were found in Remedellian tombs must go back to the very beginning of the second millennium.
