<plain_text><page sequence="1">Monarchie yields somewhat dubious results; what appears far more per- tinent is the dramatist's very real humanist preference for clemency rather than rigor in the treatment of the vanquished, which Jondorf brings out cogently in a discussion of the conflict between Agamemnon and Pyrrhe in La Troade. The concluding chapters attempt an analysis of Gamier's dramatization of political themes, and in particular what the author calls the 'orchestration' of political thought with other modes of feeling. By 'orchestration' she means something like analogical or poetic unity-how the political element is integrated with other aspects of a given drama. Before examining this quality in the plays, she gives some examples of how contemporary dramatists like Jean de la Taille and Montchrestien fail to achieve it. Her contrasts, particularly those be- tween Gamier and the latter, are quite convincing. In Montchrestien's L'Ecossaise, for instance, 'Marie Stuart's "constance" in the face of death is displayed for admiration without any complete examination of whether it is right or wrong for her to be executed. In Montchrestien this does not matter; in Gamier it would matter very much' (p. I35). After 'orchestration' most rewarding is a brief study of how Gamier rings various changes on the theme of love in Marc-Antoine: how the characters in their conflict between personal and political values come face to face with individual responsibility, rejecting the scapegoat For- tune, and declaring in effect that the fault lies not in their stars but in themselves. My chief reservation would be that such analyses are all too few and too brief. In general, however, the book asks the right questions, deals well with a goodly number of them, and most important of all, shows us more clearly than previous studies Gamier's significance as a human- ist and a compassionate witness of his time: the first dramatist to achieve a true fusion of antique and modern themes. STANFORD UNIVERSITY John C. Lapp Michael Baraz. L'Etre et la connaissance selon Montaigne. Paris: Corti, I968. 219 pp. 3oF. Professor Baraz' study is divided into four parts: 'L'Etre' (pp. 9-86), 'La Connaissance' (pp. 87-I39), 'La Personnalite' (pp. 141-208), and the 'Conclusion' (pp. 209-216). There is an 'Index des noms cites,' but no bibliographical statement. Part I is subdivided into three chapters. In Chapter I, 'Le sentiment de REVIEWS 385</page><page sequence="2">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY l'unite cosmique,' Baraz demonstrates Montaigne's awareness of the dependance of his Being on universal flux, order, and necessity.1 In Chapter 2, 'La nature et la societe,' awareness of Being and of the need for the 'conservation de notre etre' is studied in relationship to social en- vironment. Montaigne's avoidance of complete involvement in politi- cal life is dictated by prudence and by his consciousness of the laws of universal necessity. In Chapter 3, 'Images et vision de l'etre,' Baraz shows how Montaigne's vision of Being, the harmony of man and na- ture, is expressed in the metaphorical structure of the Essais.2 Part ii, 'La Connaissance,' has two chapters: 'Une notion pluriva- lente: l'inscience' and 'L'inscience et l'activite du jugement.' In the for- mer, Baraz derives the negative aspect of 'inscience' from Montaigne's critique of anthropomorphism in the 'Apologie . . .' (II, 12).3 In the latter, the most important positive aspect of 'inscience' is shown to be the application of thought (the total content of consciousness) in shap- ing personality, the 'moi.' Part III, 'La Personnalite,' contains two chapters: 'De l'inscience a la culture du moi,' and 'Personnalite et structure litteraire.' In the first part of Chapter i (pp. I43-I60), the role of thought in 'la formation du moi' receives further development. In the second part (pp. I6o-I68), Baraz explains that the cultivation of personality in Montaigne's universe, where 'l'tre et non la connaissance tient le rang supreme,' must neces- sarily lead to a friendship cult, for a friendship like that of Montaigne and La Boetie is 'la "communication a l'estre" la plus incontestable qui soit accessible a l'homme' (p. I68). In Chapter 2, after situating the 'essai' in the autobiographical tradition of the Ancients and in the baroque-classical tendencies of the sixteenth century, Baraz concludes 1 The first nine pages of the chapter, slightly revised, had appeared under the same title in Cahiers de l'Association Internationale des Etudes Franfaises, no. I4 (March I962), 211- 224. 2 Except for minor changes, the excision of two paragraphs, and the addition of a con- cluding paragraph, this chapter reproduces for the most part Baraz' article, 'Les images dans les Essais de Montaigne,' Bibliotheque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 27 (I965), 361-393. 3 Baraz' chapter, 'Sur la notion d'inscience chez Montaigne,' in De Ronsard a Breton ... Hommages a Marcel Raymond (Paris, I967), pp. 42-50, provided an important nucleus for this treatment of 'inscience.' It is curious that Baraz nowhere refers the reader to Mon- taigne's use of this almost untranslatable word in 'De la phisionomie': 'Je dis pompeuse- ment et opulemment l'ignorance, et dys la science megrement et piteusement; (c) acces- soirement cette-cy et accidentalement, celle-la expressement et principalement. Et ne traicte a point nomme de rien que du rien, ny d'aucune science que de celle de l'inscience' (II87, Pleiade-Thibaudet, I950). 386</page><page sequence="3">with a structural analysis of 'De la phisionomie' (III, I2) and of 'De l'experience' (III, 13).4 In these, he sees Montaigne's finest achievement in the literary expression of his 'moi.' In the 'Conclusion,' what was generally implicit in the body of the study is made explicit: 'On reste loin de la personnalite profonde de Montaigne tant qu'on se limite a vouloir savoir ce qu'il a pense .... II n'a certainement pas desire que son oeuvre devienne objet de connais- sance, ce qui veut dire en fait: objet d'innombrables interpretations.... Pour penetrer dans son univers interieur, il faut tout d'abord se pro- poser le meme but que lui: la modification du sentiment de l'existence' (p. 209). The twentieth-century reader and critic of Montaigne, in or- der to appreciate fully the role of 'inscience' in shaping Montaigne's personality, must himself become involved morally. Baraz would want all of us to come to know the works of Constantin Brunner,5 to whom, he says, 'revient l'inappreciable merite d'avoir donnee a ce que nous avons appele ici "inscience" une expression con- forme aux exigences de l'ere scientifique' (p. 2I 5). Basic to this modem conception of 'inscience' would be Brunner's insistence, after Spinoza, that Thought is not Knowledge.6 This most important philosophical premise is everywhere apparent in Baraz' study of Montaigne. In this reviewer's opinion, only a few contemporary critics, among them Friedrich, Thibaudet, Frame, and Gray, have succeeded in pene- trating so profoundly Montaigne's 'univers interieur.' None, it seems to me, has defined and developed so well the nature of 'inscience,' its relationship to the shaping of personality, and its expression in imagery and structure. More careful proofreading would have eliminated a number of typo- graphical errors. On page I8, 'De la ressemblance des enfans aux peres' (II, 37) is given as the title of II, I8 ('De l'affection des peres aux enfans'). Certain editorial inconsistencies can be noted: the use of 'p.' in page references, pages 36-38, elsewhere 'p.' is not used; Latin text quoted, 4 His article, 'Sur la structure d'un Essai de Montaigne (III, I3: "De l'Experience"),' Bibliotheque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 23 (I96I), 265-281, has been integrated, after revision, into the analysis. 5 'Constantin Brunner' is the nom deplume of Louis Wertheimer (I862-I937). Three of his works seem particularly relevant to Baraz' study: Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volk (I908); Unser Christus oder das Wesen des Genies (1921); Kunst, Philosophie, Mystik (I940). The whole no. 375 of Les Cahiers du Sud, vol. 57 (I964) is devoted to Brunner. A useful bibliography appears on p. 124. 6 Baraz, M., 'Prerenaissance au 2oe siecle,' Les Cahiers du Sud, no. 375, vol. 57 (I964), i9.

Agrippa d'Aubigne, poete des Tragiques. Caen: Associa- tion des Publications de la Faculte des Lettres et Sciences Humaines de l'Universite de Caen, I968. 580 pp. 5oF. Anyone who takes an interest in the ferocious wars of religion which turned the French people so viciously against one another in the late sixteenth century must read the Tragiques of Agrippa d'Aubigne. Those who are further interested in the particular expression given to that conflict by one who committed himself to it with both sword and pen will want to read Bailbe's exhaustive examination of the Tragiques. However, since the latter's approach is largely descriptive, in the aesthetic as well as in the historical parts of his study, the book will be less useful to the reader looking for a tight structural interpretation of the Tragiques as an epic poem. A brief biographical sketch and a few pages of essential information about the genesis and architecture of the Tragiques lead directly to the first major chapter which exposes all the historical relationships between the written work and the historical events which it reflects. Aubigne's sources of information, from personal observation to the popular pam- phlets, are identified, and the value of the work as a witness to history is assessed. Bailbe's handling of this material is thorough, well-docu- mented, business-like, and balanced. His point of departure for discuss- ing events and characters of the wars is always the poem so that, while the whole history of the conflict is passed in review, the study remains strictly that of the Tragiques. Constantly reminding us of Aubigne's polemical purpose in writing, he is able to make a series of judgments regarding the poet's attitude towards the events, the leaders on both sides, and the various groups, forces, and ideologies in conflict, and to prove his statements by providing examples of that attitude from every page of the poem and from its prose sequel, the Histoire universelle. Scrupulous documentation in the notes gives the skeptical reader every opportunity to verify the facts. Two central chapters treat the epic elements and the satiric character of the Tragiques. Bailbe begins each with a succinct history of these 388</page></plain_text>
