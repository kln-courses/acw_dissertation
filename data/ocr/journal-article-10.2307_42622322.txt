Rockefeller Memorial Collection, Bequest of Nelson A. Rockefeller, 1979 (1979.206.1230) Until very archaeological recent modest years, presence remains Moche both of metalwork this within powerful the has known had and a very modest presence both within the known archaeological remains of this powerful and artistically gifted ancient American people and within Moche scholarship. The modest pres- ence began approximately a hundred years ago with the work of Max Uhle at Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna in the Moche Valley, where metalwork objects that subse- quently came to be understood as Moche in style were discovered during the excavations of 1899-1900 (Uhle 19 1 3). Unearthed at Sites A and F, the metal objects were few. In 1 9 1 3 Uhle published only two of them, a small hollow gold figure, one of three, and an "end piece " of a neck ornament inlaid with turquoise (Uhle 1913: pl. 5, f and g). The two pieces were part of a cache found on the south platform of the Huaca del Sol together with other objects of gold and turquoise (Menzel 1977: 39). More of Uhle's turn-of-the-century metal discoveries at Moche were not published for many years. Parts of his unpublished work reached print through the efforts of A.L. Kroeber only in the 1940s. The Moche metal objects among them were: gold ear ornaments with wide frontais and long shafts, hollow gold ornaments and beads joined at the sides and pierced with two pairs of suspension holes in the back or sides, copper "bells 77 in the form of small heads, cast copper chisels topped with images in the round, and copper and gold ingots, among other types of works (Kroeber 1944: pls. 44, 47, 48). They greatly increased the representative types of Moche metal objects known to modern researchers. The 1940s generally were important years for the greater understanding of the ancient Moche peoples and for a clearer awareness of their handiworks. In the Chicama Valley, antiquities housed in the museum at Haci- enda Chiclln were substantial in number and played a meaningful role in Moche studies. Inaugurated in 1926, the Chiclin museum collections were enlarged through the efforts of Rafael Larco Hoyle, who worked in various north coast valleys. Digging and purchasing widely, Larco collected antiquities and pub- lished extensively on archaeological aspects of the area. One of Larco's publications, Los Mochicas, issued in 1945, was the first to illustrate major Moche works of art in metal. They included some of the most "lordly" of Moche metal object types: the great flared headdress ornaments with raised central image (Larco 1945: 29) and the elaborate nose ornaments (Larco 1945: 30). Both types - the wide, semi- circular head ornaments made to be worn centrally over the forehead, and the orna- ments that dangle from the septum of the nose thereby covering the mouth - had long been distinguished in Moche modeled and fine-line ceramic vessels. The head and nose ornaments illustrated by Larco were of gold, and although sizes were not published at the time, the headdress frontais were almost 30 cm across (Berrin 1997: cat. 139, 140) (fig. 1). 207</page><page sequence="3">i . Headdress ornament of gold of unknown provenance, 24 x 28 cm Museo Arqueológico Rafael Lareo Herrera, Lima (XSB-004-029) The nose ornaments, too, were elegantly conceived. One was of a particularly distinc- tive Moche shape, an upswept crescent that was rimmed at the bottom with a row of small dangles, a detail frequently seen in Moche fine-line drawing. All three gold nose ornaments in the 1945 publication appear to have been inlaid, perhaps with a malleable - and colorful - material. A cast chisel, said to be silver, with a rattle top in the shape of tur- baned head with turquoise inlays was also illustrated (Larco 1945: 30). It too was an indi- cation of the importance of the man (or men) with whom the objects had been buried. No source or context was published for these works,- the author commented instead on the metals available to the Moche - gold, silver, copper, and lead - and the techniques such as alloying and soldering that had been observed among the objects themselves (Larco 1945: 17, 22). Other important developments of the 1940s for both Peruvian and Moche archae- ology were the excavations of the Virú Valley Project, a multicomponent endeavor that pro- posed an "intensive study of human cultural adaptation within the confines of a small area over a long period of time" (Strong and Evans 1952: 3). One significant result of the project was the 1946 discovery of what came to be known as the Tomb of the Warrior Priest at the Huaca de la Cruz site (Strong and Evans 1952: 150-167). An aged Moche "warrior priest" had been buried extended on his back in a cane coffin with all the accoutrements symbolic of high position about him. Many of these were objects of copper and/or gilded copper. Since the discovery and publication of Virú's Warrior Priest burial, much more infor- mation has become available on Moche tombs, some of them of much higher status 208 JONES</page><page sequence="4">(Alva and Donnan 1993; Donnan and Maclcey 1978). Yet many of the features first observed in the Virú tomb have proved to be consistent with elite Moche burials as they are under- stood today (Donnan 1995). The presence in the tomb of multiple objects made of metal - including personal finery such as nose ornaments and the gilded copper headdress elements and clothing plaques - are salient features of lordly tombs. The placement of metal objects on the face and in the hands of the deceased (Donnan 1995: 143; Strong and Evans 1952: 156) is another. It is now clear that the higher the status of the personage, the greater the quantity and quality of metal objects buried with him/her. The highest- status burials have many objects of gold and silver, quantities of works made of copper, much of it gilded and/or silvered, adorning the honored lords in death. The picture of Moche metalwork began to enlarge dramatically with the discovery in the 1960s of objects in Moche style in the far north of Peru in the Piura Valley. The discover- ies, made by looters in the burial grounds in the vicinity of Cerro Vicús, included many ceramic vessels (Patellani 1970) and objects of gold, silver, and copper and their mixtures (Disselhoff 1 971). A particularly large find of metal objects was reported at Vicús in 1969 (Disselhoff 1972; Lapiner 1976: 113-114). Labeled by the local name of Loma Negra, the metal finds consisted of personal ornaments of gold and silver such as ear ornaments (La- piner 1976: pls. 380, 385, 389) nose ornaments (Lapiner 1976: pls. 390-392, 394~395, 397), and numerous objects of different size, shape, and function made of copper and gilded and silvered copper (Disselhoff 1971: figs. 1, 2, 7, 11-16, 19-20, 22; Lapiner 1976: pls. 349-355, 357-358, 360-361, 363, 369). The imagery of this large group of metal objects was also consistent with Moche iconography. Themes of domination and sac- rifice were prevalent, with many depictions of warriors (Disselhoff 1971: 1, 2, j} Lapiner 1976: pl. 381) and Decapitators (Disselhoff 1972: fig. 15; Lapiner 1976: pls. 350, 360, 363, 382). Series of small masks (Disselhoff 1972: fig. 20), some with grimacing or snarling mouths and "feline" eyes (Lapiner 1976: pls. 351, 352/ 355, 357-358), were present in the corpus. Style, too, was consistently Moche, but as Moche presence in the far north of Peru had not previously been documented archae- ologically, judgements about the nature of the find, its purpose, and its relationships - tem- poral and spatial - were left open. While many issues remained to be clarified about Loma Negra, the works of art them- selves began to be studied. Hundreds of pieces had surfaced, and many in series of gilded or silvered copper - small masks and faces, warriors and sacrificers, scorpions, spiders, crabs, and more - were known in multiples, all hammered in low relief, all with attach- ment holes, indicating a role in ancient life that could only be conjectured. The sumptu- ous objects - the head ornaments, the ear ornaments, the nose pieces - were rarer. Made of gold and silver, they were individual in their imagery and lively in presentation. Nose ornaments were a particular favorite in the upper Piura Valley for they were the most numerous luxury item (see, for example, Donnan 1990: 24-25). The aspects of Loma Negra metals that attracted attention were metallurgical ones. The Loma Negra metals are almost entirely made of hammered sheet metal. Copper was in greatest proportion. The early studies, undertaken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Heather Lechtman and col- leagues (Lechtman, Erlij, and Barry 1982), pri- marily addressed the issue of the gilded and silvered surfaces on copper. The Loma Negra gold and silver coatings were extremely thin and even, and while these qualities were par- ticularly impressive, they proved to be very difficult to study. Precisely because of the thinness of the coatings, and the presence of extensive amounts of copper corrosion prod- ucts, research into the ancient surfaces was challenging. Many experiments and careful compari- sons later, the MIT researchers concluded that the surfaces were achieved through an "electrochemical replacement process in which gold and silver were dissolved in an aqueous solution of corrosive minerals. The precious metals are then plated from solution onto the copper objects" (Lechtman, Erlij, and Barry 1982: 3). A sophisticated and ingenious process, electrochemical replacement plating had not previously been reported for the an- cient Americas, and as metallurgical studies have since continued, it is a process that has only been reported for the upper Piura Valley. JONES 209</page><page sequence="5">It has not as yet been identified anywhere else on precious metal surfaced copper objects of the Moche era (Schorsch, Howe, and Wypyski 1998: 145, 153). That the Moche metalsmiths gilded copper had been understood long before the studies mentioned above revealed one of the methods by which the ancient artisans accomplished it. Major works of art in gilded copper were known from the southern Moche region, but they were created using a method or methods other than electrochemical replacement plating. Famous among them is the "mask" (Jones 1979: 70; Schorsch 1998: fn. 78; Ubbelohde-Doering 1952: cat. 230), or gilded copper face, that was discovered in the early years of this century in a "subterranean chamber" of the Huaca de la Luna at Moche (Lehman and Doering 1924: 24, 39). First reported by the archaeologist Eduard Seier (19 12: 222-223), the chamber is now known as the Seler Tomb. The mask, which is the major extant work of art from the tomb, is lifesize but was apparently not for use during life, as there are no seeing or breathing holes in it (Benson 1972: pl. 5). The mask might have been the funerary face covering for the ancient Moche lord or priest who was un- doubtedly buried in the Seler Tomb. Alterna- tively, it could have been for attachment to a "crown or head-dress" (Ubbelohde-Doering 1952: 48), where the assertive face would have impressed all viewers. The discoveries of the late 1980s at the site of Sipán in the Lambayeque Valley (Alva 1988, 1990) would revolutionize thinking about the ancient Moche, their rulers, their artisans, their metalworlc, and countless other aspects of the Moche life and history. The graves that have been excavated at Sipán under the direction of Walter Alva of the Museo Arqueológico Nacional Brüning de Lambayeque (Alva 1994; Alva and Donnan 1993) have revealed a wealth of metalworlc: personal ornaments and insignia of gold and silver; banners, clothing, and headdress ele- ments of gilded and silvered copper,- cast staves and scepters, other finery in shell, stone, feathers, and cotton textile. The exca- vations, which are ongoing, show that the greatest lord - known as the Lord of Sipán, found in Tomb 1 - was buried with his entire extended body covered with objects of metal from the shallow gold dish or "cap" on his head to the silver sandals on his feet (Alva, this volume, and 1994: 43-145; Alva and Donnan 1993: 55-125). It is instructive to look at the metal objects deemed worthy of the Lord of Sipán in death. They were many. Three large shrouds wrapped the lord completely, two of them sewn with gilded copper platelets; more gilded copper platelets and emblematic low- relief human figures covered the surface of four cloth banners (Alva 1994: fig. 49). Other items accompanying the deceased included a large gilt copper ornament - perhaps a pec- toral or headdress ornament - with two large raised and extended hands (Alva 1994: figs. 60, 61); an outer tunic covered totally with gilded copper platelets,- four nose ornaments, two of upswept crescent shape in gold and two round - one gold and one silver (Alva 1994: figs. 64, 65, 74); and three pairs of elabo- rate gold ear ornaments with long narrow shafts and wide frontais inlaid with gold and turquoise (Alva 1994: figs. 39-41, 44, 47). The great lord's funerary mask was of gold, made in separate parts. One covered the lower face and mouth, other elements were a band of teeth and individual nose and eye cover- ings (Alva and Donnan 1993: figs. 90, 92). A gold caplike bowl was on the head; four neck- laces of gold and silver were at the neck (Alva 1994: figs. 90, 92, 97, 99); cast chisel-bladed scepters of silver - one with a hammered gold top - were in the hands (Alva 1994: figs. 77, 83). Ingots of gold were in the mouth and right hand, a silver ingot in the left. Two head crests of hammered gold (Alva 1994: figs. 106, 124), one of which had such great size that it must have been difficult to support upright on the head, were underneath the body, as were two large backflaps - again one gold and one silver (Alva 1994: figs. 109-111). Other items included crescent-shaped bells of gold and/or gilded copper, gilded copper headdress elements, a necklace of gilt copper head-form beads, and copper objects such as belt finials, lance points, daggers, and straps. While the works in metal were in the greatest array, they were not the only funer- ary offerings closely accompanying the body of the Sipán lord. Shoulder-width shell bead collars, shell and gold bead bracelets, and panaches of colorful feathers were also placed directly on, above, or below the body. The lord's important personal regalia were not 210 JONES</page><page sequence="6">only part of his mortuary bundle, they were directly on his person, wrapped as he was within three burial shrouds. Two hundred years earlier, another power- ful ruler had been laid to rest in the Sipán necropolis (Alva 1994: 174-233; Alva and Donnan 1993: 167-217). Tomb 3 is thought to be that of a man of rank equal in his time to the Lord of Sipán in his. There are many simi- larities in the contents of the graves of the two rulers. The personal regalia in Tomb 3, in- cluding all of the metalwork, much of which was of gilded copper, were on or very close to the extended body of the lord as they had been in Tomb 1 . While specific details of the tombs differ, significant elements are the same. Banners with low-relief gilded copper images of considerable similarity were in both tombs, as were burial masks, headdress and pectoral ornaments, crescent-shaped bells, necklaces of gold and silver, numerous elabo- rate nose ornaments, pairs of ear ornaments of gold and silver, cast chisel-bladed scepters, and gold and silver ingots on head and hands. In Tomb 3, a silver nose ornament was dis- tinctively held in the left hand, implying a significance to nose ornaments that goes beyond their ornamental form. The similari- ties of ritual burial practice had been main- tained for at least two hundred years, and are but one indication of the persistence of belief and the codification of Moche burial prac- tices. They also show how firmly established were the prerogatives and traditions of power. The placement of metal objects in the mouth/face and in the hands of the deceased was clearly a major part of the burial ritual, whether the metals were gold, silver, or folded pieces of copper, as they had been in the Tomb of the Warrior Priest in the Virú Valley (Strong and Evans 1952: 156). The precious- ness of the metals so placed increased with the power and rank of the interred, but the role played in death by the metal objects, however valuable, appears to have remained the same. Emblematic of what must have been a protective or empowering role or quali- ty inherent in metals in Moche belief, the fact that the greatest lords of the land were buried totally covered with metal objects must have accorded them the maximum authority and protection in death. The importance of the role metal objects had in burials, and the quantity buried with great men - as illustrated by the Sipán tombs, was to continue on the north coast of Peru for centuries. The continued inclusion of a myri- ad of valuable metal objects in the tombs of the mighty is demonstrated by a burial of some hundreds of years later, that of Huaca Loro at Batán Grande also in the greater Lam- bayeque Valley. Huaca Loro is associated with a later culture, known as Sicán or Lam- bayeque, dated to a.d. 700-1375, which was clearly the inheritor of the earlier Moche tra- ditions in the valley. The Huaca Loro tomb was excavated in the early 1990s (Shimada 1995; Shimada and Griffin 1994), and con- tained the body of a lord, fully accoutered in ceremonial attire that consisted of a great gold mask and headdress (Shimada 1995: fig. 104), multiple sets of ear ornaments, a mantle originally sewn with nearly two thousand gold foil squares (Shimada 1995: fig. 36), as well as many other objects of gold, silver, gilded copper, and other precious materials. A hierarchy of placement is discernable within the funerary offerings. Gold and silver objects were closest to the body, works of gilded cop- per, other metals and materials farther from it. So rich was the Batán Grande lord that two different deposits of personal finery - of gold, silver, and gilded copper - were placed sepa- rately from the body, a considerable deviation from earlier practice. Thousands of pieces of gilt copper scrap in the Huaca Loro tomb were further evidence of the significance of metals. Of the approximately 1.2 tons of funerary offerings in the grave, nearly three quarters were of metal (Shimada and Griffin 1994: 83). The earlier Moche discoveries at Sipán, however, now totaling twelve tombs, have shed much light on all Moche metal objects, those from Loma Negra included (Jones 1993a). Royal tombs, as well as the tombs of priests, warriors, guardians, attendants, and others, can be hypothesized to have existed, using the evidence of the Loma Negra metals corpus and the analogy of Sipán (Jones 1993b). As the wonders of Sipán were being revealed between 1987 and 1990, archaeological re- search was also being conducted in the upper Piura Valley under the auspices of the Ponti- ficia Universidad Católica del Perú (Guffroy, Kaulicke, and Makowslci 1989,- Kaulicke 1991, 1992, 1994; Makowslci 1994,- Makowslci et al. 1994), where the excavations finally revealed an actual presence for the Moche in JONES 211</page><page sequence="7">Piura. Even though no direct connection to southern Moche metalworking or metal- using circumstances was established, local Vicús memory did include information that "much material was obtained from the sack- ing of what seems to be a burial platform" (Kauliclce, personal communication, 1999) at Loma Negra, and that the bodies there were probably extended (Kaulicke 1992: 882). The existence of a Moche burial platform in the area thought to be the source of the Loma Negra metals, and the possibility that it held a number of important Moche graves with multiple objects is credible if the corpus of Loma Negra metal objects is considered. The Loma Negra metals include objects of personal finery in gold and silver that were appropriate for Moche royalty, and there are the quantities of gilded and silvered copper works sufficient to cover lordly corpses in death. Variations in iconography and metal- working technology can further support hypothesized time differences among the Loma Negra pieces. For instance, two nose ornaments of gold and silver can serve to illustrate issues of iconography and tech- nology that have implications for time differ- ences among the Loma Negra works. Nose ornaments are the most numerous of the regal Piura objects and it is probable that there were numbers of them in each major Loma Negra tomb. The two to be discussed here, an ornament with spiders and one in the shape of an anthropomorphic head, might have been placed in graves at about a gener- ation apart, perhaps more. Hypothetically the earlier of the two is that with spiders (fig. 2). A particularly appealing object, it has small gold spiders - the backs and eyes of which originally held tiny inlays - on a rectangular gold "web." The gold spiders are visually set off by the silver plates to which they are attached, and these in turn are framed by the gold web. To join the whole, the six spiders were soldered to six individual silver back- plates that were soldered to the gold grid. Sol- dering is a metallurgical joining method not often used for gold and silver objects at Loma Negra (Schorsch 1998: 118-119), but it is one in use in Cupisnique times in the central Andes (Lechtman 1996: 55-66). Spiders are also known in the art of the north coast in Cupisnique times (Salazar- Burger and Burger 1982: 234). They continue in Moche art, where a major role as super- natural decapitator develops for them (Cordy- Collins 1992: 215-219). Sheet-copper spiders (Disselhoff 1972: fig. 22) from Loma Negra are rendered with round bodies and neatly encir- cling legs like those of the nose ornament. These spiders are straightforward depictions that do not have the overlay of decapitator symbolism that is so pervasive at Sipán, or at a later time at Loma Negra. The stylized natu- ralism of spider depiction on the nose orna- ment, taken together with the basic metallur- gical features of its manufacture, indicates an early Loma Negra date for it. The multiple metal plates of which the spider ornament is composed give the orna- ment a slightly heavy, solid air. This quality is not present in the second nose ornament to be considered, an anthropomorphic head with a plumed, turban headdress, undoubtedly depicting a Moche lord (fig. 3). It is of gold worked in low relief, and has a silver nose piece of its own. The hammered gold sheet of the ornament is physically and visually light in weight. The plumes are flexible and grace- ful, while the tiny nose ornament moves freely. Even now, with missing eye inlays and lacking many of the sparkly silver dangles from its surface, the ornament has a self- important air. 2.

Rockefeller Memorial Collection, Bequest of Nelson A. Rockefeller, 1979 (1979.206.1223) The manufacture of this nose ornament is particularly sophisticated, and it must have been the work of the master artist-metal- smith of the time. The gold anthropomorphic face has silvered elements in the headdress, ear ornaments, and collar. These details are emphasized with clarity and form a setting for the silver dangles. The means by which the details were silvered directly onto the gold is as yet undetermined. The silvering of gold is an uncommon practice anywhere in the world, and the method used by the ancient Loma Negra metalsmith has so far eluded determination by modern researchers (Schorsch 1998: 125-127). The elegant accom- plishment of the method, however, is ideal for a gold and silver object that needs lightness to be worn comfortably. Perhaps depicting the lordly face of the wearer himself, the nose ornament successfully unites form, technique and image, thus testifying to a Moche metal- lurgical tradition of breadth and imagination. Moche metallurgical traditions continue to be studied today, and they have proved to be most revealing of the degree of technologi- cal ingenuity present, particularly within the Loma Negra metals (Centeno and Schorsch 1998; Diez Canseco 1994,- Howe et al. 1993; Schorsch 1998; Schorsch, Howe, and Wypyski 1998). The skill the metalsmiths achieved in manipulating their material allowed for much refinement in the finished works of art. Coat- ings of gold and silver alloys on a copper base allowed for a notable range of colors, which were both inventive and subtle. An example of the complexity of visual presentation achieved with the juxtaposition of different gold- silver color combinations on a copper support is a Loma Negra disk with a spread- wing owl in relief in the center (fig. 4). jones 213</page><page sequence="9">4- Disk ornament of gilded and silvered copper from Loma Negra, 28.2 cm. diam.

Goldberg, 1986 (1987.394-56) Made of individual parts of gilded and sil- vered copper sheet of closely hued color, the owl itself is golden and the background silver. The wide outlining rim of the disk is golden as are the two rows of dangles attached to it (Schorsch 1998: 114-116; Schorsch, Howe, and Wypyski 1998: 155). The " juxtaposition of similar metal colors and the illusion of movement elicited by variations in surface texture, coupled with the actual movement of formal components... contribuì e to their distinctive appearance" (Schorsch, Howe and Wypyski 1998: 156). Gold and silver alloys were used in numerous imaginative ways on the copper substrates of important ritual and personal objects of all sorts at Loma Negra. The presence at Loma Negra of copper in quantity is highly significant. As a substrate 214 JONES</page><page sequence="10">5 . Crown of gold from Chongoyape, 23.5 cm. high National Museum of the American Indian, Washington. (16/1972 B) for surface coatings of gold and silver, copper offered the opportunity for the production and use of many sophisticated works of art. When new, and produced by the electro- chemical replacement plating process of Piura, which created the smooth, shiny metallic surfaces, the gilded and silvered works must have been barely distinguishable from objects of gold and silver themselves. While the rela- tive value of the metal content of the two dif- ferent kinds of works must have been clear to maker, owner, and ritual specialist, the visual effect of the two types of works must have been much the same upon first view. Gilded copper is, of course, also present in quantity, and in important objects, at Sipán. The presence of so many copper-based objects at both Loma Negra and Sipán raises ques- tions about earlier finds that are considered to be major Moche tombs. For instance, did the graves from which the headdress frontais and nose ornaments published by Larco in 1945 contain objects of gilded or silvered copper? Or did the so-called Seler Tomb in the Huaca de la Luna, where a few such objects did survive (Jones 1979: 70-72), contain more? Is it possible that there was a difference in the quantities of metalworlc objects available to rulers in the southern Moche region as opposed to those in the north, where both Loma Negra and Sipán were located? Another possibility is that the gilded cop- per objects from known - and many unknown - tombs simply did not survive, or if they did survive were so little valued that they were not recorded. The experience of Ramiro Matos in 1963 when traveling in upper Piura is illuminating on this issue, as he reports: "Quisiéramos decir unas pocas palabras sobre los objetos metálicos que hallamos en nue- stro recorrido. Son realmente considerables, tanto por su abundancia, cuanto por su con- tenido artístico y técnico. Cuando visitamos la casa... en Pabur, vimos un lote de piezas metálicas arrumadas en el suelo. Cuando pre- guntamos sobre el destino de ellas, nos repuso [sic], 'son objetos sin valor.7 Es que eran obje- tos de cobre y otros de cobre bañado" (Matos 1 9 6 9 : 1 2 3 ) . 1 The problem of perceived relative value of the copper and gilt copper objects is compounded by the difficulty of preserving the integrity of the inevitably thin sheet- metal archaeological pieces. Advanced age and the condition-after-burial of the Moche metalworlc is especially troublesome for the gilded and/or silvered copper objects. The soils of the northern Peruvian coast are saline and therefore very corrosive for archaeological objects. The metal objects can be a difficult to maintain because they are very fragile and often highly mineralized. All three metals - gold, silver, and copper - interacted with each other and with their burial environment over a long period of time, and their surfaces can be all but obscured by the variety of ma- terials on them. The conservation, storage, jones 215</page><page sequence="11">6. Pair of gold ear ornaments from Chongoyape, 10.2 cm. diam. National Museum of the American Indian, Washington. (16/1972 G) and display of Moche copper objects is a chal- lenge under the best of circumstances (Howe et al. 1993). While the inheritors and continuers of many Moche burial practices regarding metalwork, and the splendid outfitting of wealthy rulers in golden and silvery raiment are known, as the example of Huaca Loro at Batán Grande shows, the beginnings of the practices that were so well developed by Moche lords and their metalsmiths are more elusive. Personal ornaments of gold and silver exist from pre-Moche times (Alva 1992), but there is some disjunction in specific object type between them and Moche works (Don- nan 1992). Two well-known groups illustrate the precedents to Moche works. Considered to date to about the Janabarriu phase at Chavín de Huántar (Burger 1992: 203-206), or approximately 400 to 200 b.c., the first group was published in 1929 by Julio C. Tello. They were chance finds of the late 1920s made near Chongoyape in the upper Lambayeque Valley (Burger 1996: 47-52; Lothrop 1941).

The major works of art in metal from both Chongoyape and Kuntur Wasi are gold crowns (Lothrop 1941: pl. 16; Onuki 1995: pl. i; Tello 1929: 156). They are straight-sided, cylindrical shapes of hammered sheet gold with low relief decoration worked around the circumference of the crown (fig. 5). Ear ornaments are another important type, and pairs exist in both groups. They have short shafts and broad frontais with a central hole (Lothrop 1941: pl. 17; Onuki 1995: pl. 3; Tello 1929: 156). Kuntur Wasi pairs are without decoration, while a number from Chongo- yape have repeated, patterned elements around the perimeter of the frontal (fig. 6). These precious metal embellishments were 8. Nose ornament of gold from Chavín de Huántar, 3.2 X 9.6 cm The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1999, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Tishman (58.181) made for the head, including the crest/fore- head, ears, and nose, but the shape of the orna- ments deemed appropriate at these earlier sites is not that of later Moche examples. The wide, flat, flared-out frontais with raised central image (see fig. i) are not among the Chongoyape/Kuntur Wasi works, where headpieces are tall cylinders. Nor do the ear ornaments have the solid, circular frontal with centrally organized designs (fig. 7) and long, counterbalancing shaft of Moche exam- ples. Nose ornaments of the earlier period, too, differ in shape, if comparisons are made to the gold find reportedly made at Chavín de Huántar (Lothrop 195 1: 234). The Chavín nose ornaments are whiskerlike in their slender elegance (fig. 8) and do not have the programmed outlines of the larger, flam- boyant Moche works. The early phase of Moche metalwork is considered to come from Loma Negra in upper Piura, and from the site of La Mina in the Jequetepeque Valley, because both sites are associated with ceramic vessels of Moche I style. La Mina, a unique tomb in the lower Jequetepeque Valley, was looted in the late 1980s, but underwent salvage excavation, so that various aspects of its physical properties are known (Donnan 1993,- Narváez 1994). The gold and silver metal objects reported to be from this site are among the most visually arresting of all Moche works of art. Among them are the flared headdress crests with raised central image (Donnan 1992: figs. 116, 123, 142), and numerous nose ornaments of solidity and size (Donnan 1992: figs. 127-131). Loma Negra metalwork objects, too, have both artistic and metallurgical complexity and exhibit the required Moche details of shape and size. Distinctively, few headdress crests are reported from Loma Negra, but nose and ear ornaments in classic Moche shape are among that corpus. Both ceramic and metal objects from La Mina and Loma Negra fit well into the Moche I iconographie canon, but if these sites are exemplars of the earliest Moche style in metalwork, then form, image, and technology were already firmly in place when they were made. Some identifiable, and meaningful, changes from earlier central Andean traditions in metalwork, as illus- trated by comparisons with the Chongoyape/ Kuntur Wasi works, have occurred. What occasioned such changes remains to be dis- covered, but certain indications point to the northern Andes as a contributing factor as far as metalwork is concerned. The gold objects unearthed in upper Piura at Cerro Callingará in the mid-1950s (Alva 1992; La Industria 1956 [?]), are a salient con- tributing factor. Known also by the name of the nearby town of Frías, the find included such significant gold objects that they sur- vived the looters7 melting pot and were seized by local Peruvian officials. Thus entering col- lections in Peru (Alva 1992: figs. 60-69), they became well known. The most important pieces were published within a very few years of discovery (Mujica 1959: 268-275). One of them, the so-called Venus de Frías (Alva 1992: figs. 60-61), has taken on a meaningful role in JONES 217</page><page sequence="13">the question of source. A hollow figure made of sheet gold, it is clearly in the Tolita- Tumaco style of northern Ecuador/southern Colombia (Jones 1979: 86-91). On the basis of formal comparisons with ceramic figures, the Venus de Frías can be dated within the period between the first century b.c. and the first century a.D. (Scott and Bouchard 1988). Other of the Frías gold objects are in the same Tolita-Tumaco style, but not all. Since the time of the original Callingará find, apparently made by local farmers (Kaulicke, personal communication, 1999), other evidence of relationships to Ecuador have emerged through what are seen as ceramic associations (Amaro 1994: 78-80; Kaulicke 1991: 418-419; Lumbreras 1979: 22-25). Trade, most particularly for the much prized Spondylus shell, has been proposed as a vehicle for interaction between northern Peru and Ecuador (Hocquenghem et al. 1993: 453), and studies of the frontiers between the cultural areas of northern Peru and southern Ecuador have been undertaken (Hocquen- ghem 1 991). The most substantial connection is the Callingará gold find, however, where gold objects from northern Ecuador were actually unearthed in northern Peru. Buried at such a considerable distance from their place of origin, the Ecuadorian gold objects are taken to indicate a possible trading loca- tion at Cerro Callingará (Kaulicke, personal communication, 1999). It must have been an important one if the high quality of the Frías goldwork is considered. The nature of the contact between the cen- tral and northern Andes as it relates to metal- work is a long way from being understood. Yet some form of interaction with the north- ern Andes appears to have existed in the upper Piura Valley, perhaps in the centuries around the beginning of the common era. Such contacts between the two areas might explain some of the formal and technological changes that appear in early Moche metal- work, for both Ecuador, and Colombia even further north, had viable metalworking traditions at the time. The possibility has been proposed that the Moche style coalesced in the Piura-Upper Jequetepeque area (Kau- licke 1994: 358), and if this proves to be cor- rect, it is probable that the northern Andean metalworking traditions made contributions to it. If so, such contributions became part of singularly important developments in the central Andes, for the Moche were the origi- nators of the greatest period in Andean metal- lurgy. The availability of copper, its new cul- tural significance, and the plethora of gilding techniques employed with it, lead to a virtual metallurgical " explosion/7 when " except for tin bronze, all the significant metals, all the significant alloys, and all the significant coloring techniques were invented. The tre- mendous originality, creativity, and real tech- nical sophistication of the Moche was never surpassed in the Andes. In that sense, Andean metallurgy is Moche metallurgy" (Lechtman 1993). NOTE i. "We would like to say a few words about the metal objects we found on our trip. They were considerable, as much for their abundance as for artistic and technical content. When we visited the house ... in Pabur, we saw a group of metal pieces stowed on the floor. When we asked what would happen to them, they responded, 'they are of no value.' It is because they were objects of copper and gilt-copper." 218 JONES</page><page sequence="14">BIBLIOGRAPHY Alva, Walter 1988 Discovering the New World's Richest Unlooted Tomb.
