<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Literature "Core" at the State University of Iowa BY JOHN C. McGALLIARD since 1944, when the faculty voted the present curriculum, the core courses in literature at the State University of Iowa have not belonged formally to the English department. Along with the other core courses, and the basic skills, the literature core forms a part of the administrative unit which we call General Studies. This unit has what may be designated as assimilated depart mental status. It has a separate budget and a director. The core courses as a whole are an effort to re orient and rebuild the familiar required courses which occupy most of the student's time before he enters upon the concentrated work of a "major," traditionally occupying the last two years. The core program attempts to make this period which (for the most part) precedes spe cialization more meaningful and intellectually fruitful than it was in the past. The object of the separation from departmental auspices is put by President Virgil M. Hancher, with caution, in the first number of this Journal. He agrees that those who favor breadth via departmental distri bution are on the right road. Then he asks: . . . but would they not be further along the right road if they took the position that there are fundamental principles or subject matter of physical science, or of biological science, of social science or of the humanities, cutting across departmental lines, that may be combined to give the student a course with valid intellectual content which will at the same time give him a better understanding of the world in which he lives than he has any reasonable chance of obtaining from a single course in a single de partment? 1 1 Journal of General Education, I (October 1946), 12. 204 Iowa had already answered "yes" in 1944. Henceforth a student in the College of Liberal Arts must earn eight semester hours in each of four groups of core courses: (1) Literature, (2) Social Science, (3) Natural Science, (4) His torical and Cultural Studies. Within each group he has an intentionally limited amount of choice. These core courses have been developed ? are still in process of development ? in accordance with the recently emerging or emerged conception nowadays designated by its most articulate spon sors as "general education." According to the opening editorial of Dean Earl J. McGrath, also in the first number of The Journal of General Education, "General education is that which prepares the young for the common life of their time and their kind" (Vol. I, p. 3). Common is the key word ? common life; not merely com mon American or common Anglo-Saxon. A legiti mate interpretation of the sentence envisages the student as a citizen of the world; for I take "their kind" to be the human kind. Again, from the same editorial, "General education is not concerned with the esoteric and highly specialized knowledge of the scholar." Its concern with knowledge is not less thorough and earnest than that of the professional or vocational specialist. But it seeks the knowledge of greatest value to the student as man and citizen. Hence, finally, "The reaction against specialism is accompanied by an effort to integrate the subject matter of related disciplines" (p. 5). Our literature core is in harmony with these ideas and aims. This is not surprising, in view of</page><page sequence="2">The Literature "Core" at the State University of Iowa 205 the fact that it was established, in essentials, some fifteen years ago under the leadership of Norman Foerster, who anticipated the views stated above by half a generation. In a letter sent last summer to new members of the staff, Professor Seymour M. Pitcher, chairman of the Literature Core, says: The point of view in these courses is that of general education and general literature. In them literature is taught ... as imitation and criticism of life. Students are encouraged to think of literature as a characteristic human activity . . . , not merely as manifestation of a national culture. ORGANIZATION OF LITERATURE CORE COURSES Before taking up the texts, a few words about machinery and organization are perhaps in order. Of our three semester courses, each carrying four hours of credit and involving four class meetings a week, the student must take two ? any two. At present the courses are designated, respective ly, The Greeks and the Bible (Literature Core 1), English and American Authors (Literature Core 2), and Introduction to Modern Literature (Lit erature Core 3). The courses may be elected in any order; classes in all three are offered through out the year and in the summer. In popularity the Introduction to Modern Literature runs somewhat ahead of the other two, which are currently about even. We keep the sections at an enrollment of thirty five or less. The instructor in any section is the sole teacher of the course for the members of his class. There is no division into huge lecture au diences and concomitant quiz sections. Instead, each section is in itself an independent lecture audience, discussion group, and writing class within limits. All sections complete a uniform minimum of texts. Over these a uniform final examination and, sometimes, a uniform mid semester test, are given. Except for these, all assignments and all testing are in the hands of the separate instructors, who also read and grade their own students on the uniform examination. All students write at least 2,500 words during the semester, usually distributed over four or five essay assignments. Before admission to any of the Literature Core courses the student must have passed examinations in the course called Com munication Skills. This he accomplishes either after or without taking the course; some students are exempted at the outset (ten to fifteen per cent), some pass after one semester, some after two, a few after three. The rest seldom remain in the university ? after three semesters of failure in a course covering the mechanics of writing, speaking before a small group, and reading com prehension. Communication Skills does the work of freshman English composition. With inevitable exceptions, mistakes, and sheer flukes, it does a good job; it has taken out most of the drudgery of reading student themes primarily for mistakes in mechanics. Consequently we can assign essays, not themes: that is, discussions connecting the literature read with the student's experience and observation, instead of mere exercises in elementary techniques of exposition. In the fall of 1947 we resumed the special classes for conspicuously superior students. This feature of our program was dropped during the war because of inadequate staff. Enrollment in these classes is doubly optional: on the part of the student recommended and accepted and on the part of the instructor concerned. With this reser vation ? and it is highly important, because it makes the difference between our plan and auto matic sectioning according to ability ? we try to get the ablest, the maturest, the best read, and the most interested students in one of three special classes. These classes do approximately the work of the three core courses in two semesters. But they do it without extra credit. The only rewards are smaller classes, classmates of similar high abil ity, and a less standardized procedure. We aim to accept for these classes only the best of the clearly potential "A's" ? that is, about 60 or 70 of, say, 1,500 entering students. Enrollment in the special class is, of course, no guarantee of a grade of "A"; the student gets whatever he earns according to the higher standards of these classes. If he does inferior work he is sent back to a regular class.</page><page sequence="3">206 The Journal of General Education I have said that the Literature Core courses are not a part of the English department, either in the catalogue or in the budget. But (aside from part-time instructors, that is, graduate students) it is the policy of the university to appoint no one to the sole and permanent post of teacher of core courses. Everyone teaching a core (of any group) is a member of a university department as well. We contemplate no division of the staff into junior and senior colleges. Thus teachers of the Literature Core are ordinarily members of the English department. Theoretically, however, they might be members of any literature department at all relevant to the material studied, or of the departments of religion or philosophy, provided only that they are willing and able to deal with the texts as literature. This year a member of the classics department is teaching a class of Literature Core 1. On the other hand, it is our policy to have every member of the English department teach at least one core course. The only exceptions are (1) those mem bers of the department who do extradepartmental teaching in the other related area of General Studies, Communications Skills, and (2) a very few persons in their sixties or partially retired. In the matter of teaching assignment, individ ual preferences can usually be gratified within the three-course framework. New full-time mem bers of the staff are expected to teach all three courses within two or three years; indeed, in terest in the program as a whole is a condition of appointment. But an instructor begins ordinarily with two or three sections all in one of three cores; and so far as possible ? that is usually ? his wishes are respected in the matter. It may be of interest to note that as a whole Literature Core 3 is taught by the youngest group in the depart ment, Core 2 includes all the older members, and Core 1 is handled predominantly by a middle group (they would not like to be called middle aged!), say, 30 to 45. An important fact about the program is that it has been developed, adopted, and changed by the teaching staff ? especially, to be sure, by the full-time members. A formal or informal vote of acceptance, continuation, substitution, or al teration sustains the general plan as well as the parts thereof. The dean of the college, the director of general studies, the chairman of the English department, and the chairman of the Literature Core ? in the order of increasing intensity of gaze ? keep an eye or quarter eye on the pro gram. And the faculty and institution generally have steadily shown an interest and exerted an influence which I believe to be, in sum, if not in all items, thoroughly salutary. Thus the stimulus to the adoption of Literature Core 3 (Modern Literature) came both from inside and from out side the teaching staff. But the choice of texts to be studied here, as elsewhere, was and is decided by the wishes of the teachers themselves, deter mined when necessary by counting noses. Now, why have we selected certain books, rather than others? Our aim is to teach the best literary works in the Western tradition. But this statement requires some clarification. It is to be noted that the program is not that of a world literature course; we undertake no responsibility to "represent," for example, India or China. The Western tradition forms a continuous, if not an organic whole; it includes the Old and New Testaments. It does not, in the same sense, include the literature of ancient Egypt or eastern Asia. Nor, within the tradition, do we attempt historical or geographical symmetry; there is, for instance, no Roman literature in the plan. Further, our texts all qualify aesthetically; they are literature as well as Great Books. The course is thus to be distinguished from those in which, let us say, Aristotle's Politics or Newton's Principia Mathe matics are read. Such books, which may well find a place in a course in the humanities, do not, we think, belong in a literature core. We aim to teach the best literary works that can be successfully taught to students in the first or second year of college. This necessary reservation imposes certain choices. Thus we have found Plato's Republic, taken as a whole ? and we insist on taking books as wholes ? too ambitious. Some of the Socratic</page><page sequence="4">The Literature "Core" at the State University of Iowa 207 dialogues are not. And Lucretius fails to appear, not because we dislike his un-Platonic, Epicurean science and philosophy, but simply because the De Return Natura, magnificent poem that it is, is too technical, as a whole, for our sophomores. We prefer Chaucer's human to Dante's divine comedy for similar reasons ? I need not expatiate. But the name of Dante raises another question of general policy. To what extent should works which must be read in translation be included in a course in literature? We believe that some im portant literary ? that is, aesthetic ? qualities are unimpaired: the design, the plan, the ordering of the attitudes and feelings expressed. Other qual ities are unavoidably lost: those inherent in the unique word and the unique phrase of the original language. Hence our large reliance upon works in the English language: 100 percent in Core 2, 50 percent in Core 1 (we regard the King James Bible as an integral part of English literature), about 70 percent in Core 3. Now let us turn to the texts. LITERATURE CORE 1 : THE GREEKS AND THE BIBLE A College Bible (Crofts) : Genesis, Exodus (I XXI), I Samuel-II Kings, Amos, Isaiah, Job, Ec clesiastes, Luke The Odyssey of Homer (Shaw translation) (Oxford) Three Greek Tragedies (Chicago) : Aeschylus, "Prometheus Bound; Sophocles, Oedipus the King; Euripides, Hippolytus The Works of Plato (Modern Library) ; Euthy phro, Apology, Cri to, Phaedo (beginning and end: the death of Socrates), Protagoras As can be seen, we spend half a semester on the Bible. Our purposes here are essentially the same as in the teaching of Homer or Chaucer or Shakespeare or Plato. These are: an intelligent mastery of narrative and expository content; a comprehension of ideas and attitudes; and assimila tion of aesthetic qualities. In Genesis^ for example, we want the student to gain a reasonable knowl edge of the stories of the Creation, the Garden of Eden, the Flood; of the patriarchal personages and their mode of life; of the more or less individualized and diversely motivated characters such as Jacob and Joseph. We take him rapidly through the career of Moses, who awoke a people to national and religious awareness (we stop with the handing down of the Ten Commandments at Mt. Sinai). Then (omitting, according to the minimum list, the stirring stories in Judges; but many of us do read them), we follow the biog raphies of Saul, David, and Solomon and more rapidly, the history of the two kingdoms until the captivity. So far as ideas and attitudes are concerned, ours is a secular reading of a book ? I should say books ? elsewhere encountered by the student, if at all, as a thing sacred and wholly apart. As all secular reading should, ours aims to be sympathetic but neutral. We neither espouse nor condemn; we neither exhort nor scoff. Instead we seek to under stand. We inquire what conceptions of man and of God are to be found in the various parts of the Bible. We observe what kind of man is approved, imitated, or condemned; and when and why. We note the developing conceptions of deity; water sprite at the brook Jabbok; thundering, jealous tribal god; vengeful lord; shepherd of his chosen man or people; searcher of hearts; universal God of righteousness and mercy; anthropomorphic fashioner of clay men in one account, spiritual Creator of the universe in the other. We are interested in the change from ritual ordination ? the primitive priestly era ? to the ethical inter pretation of religion; the "social gospel" of Amos, the clear monotheism and ethical idealism of Isaiah. With the separation of conduct from material reward we leave the Old Testament; that is, with the religious enthusiasm of Job and the religious pessimism of Ecclesiastes in the face of identical insight. In the New Testament we read ? rapid ly, as is evident ? Luke's account of the life and teaching of Jesus. Here, while trying to grasp the main outline of biographical, political, and religious events, we concentrate primarily on the way of life which Jesus recommends to man. You</page><page sequence="5">208 The Journal of General Education available in the School of Religion.) In the course of the reading most of us point out the Funda mentalist attitude, the Modernist believer's at titude, and the agnostic and atheistic views. But we do not choose among them. The difficulties encountered are less frequent and less serious than one might expect. For nearly all ? not all ? religious groups in this country have accepted, in varying degree, the broadly uniform results of the historical and scholarly study of the Bible and of ancient history. These concern such matters as the chronological periods represented, the composite authorship of certain books, the development of varying religious atti tudes at different epochs, etc. And for the con venience of the teacher ? and the student, if he is interested ? the fruits of these studies are con veniently garnered in a large number of pretty reliable commentaries easily available in the library. The range is from the elaborate International Critical Commentary to excellent one-volume Bible encyclopedias. Occasionally we do have mild rumblings. We are quite agreeable to the use of other versions, if the student prefers ? for example, those autho rized for Catholics. A very few students object to anything but the familiar limp leather and thin pages. We cheerfully let them keep their old Bibles! Once in a great while a firm Funda mentalist objects even to the statement of the Modernist attitude toward the text. One walked out of my classroom last spring, despite all my efforts at impartiality. But it was once in fifteen years ? and he later recanted ? after receiving a good grade in the course! And perhaps one per cent of our students still believe at the end that "the Bible should be left to the churches"; that is, they have not accepted our cardinal premise, namely, that the Bible ? otherwise neglected al most wholly ? merits a secular reading. But the total dissenting minority is exceedingly small. The other half of the semester is devoted to Homer, Greek drama, and Plato. We think the Odyssey one of the best stories in the world. We want the student to enjoy the diversity of adven may well shudder ? so do we; not volumes but libraries have been written upon the third Gospel. Yet this book of Luke is a condensed biography not too long for the "abridged book" item in the monthly Reader's Digest. In many ways it is sim ple; and surely many simple men have understood it in its essentials. Why should we assume that our students cannot? On the side of aesthetics, the first thing we do for the student is to present him with a readable volume printed and bound like other books. (It marks chapters but not verses.) It includes about one-fourth of the total text in the King James version, omitting, along with much valuable ma terial? but still conspicuously omitting ? those parts that have no more to do with literature than the Consolidated Statutes of Iowa or the United States Census Reports. We try to show the student that the Bible is not a book but an anthology con taining legend, history, tales or short stories, biography, lyric poetry, philosophical poetry, poet ic prophecy. Then we read these for what they are, just as we should do with a more or less com parable anthology of, say, American poetry and prose (though we have larger blocks, more nearly complete units, than most anthologies). We do not neglect to read aloud a great deal of the sonorous Elizabethan prose of the English trans lation. We do not teach dogma or belief. By definition of our aims, we refrain from pronouncing upon questions like the inspiration of the text (or translation), the objective truth of miracles, or the supernatural events in the life of Jesus. Our goal is always to find out first, as clearly as we can, what the text apparently meant to the man who wrote it and the audience for whom he first wrote; and, second, to ask ? if not to answer in full ? what value it may have for us today. We may mention in passing the theological use of, for instance, prophetic passages (relating the Old and New Testaments) ; but we do not tarry on such matters. We are, I hope, neither cowards nor casuists. We simply believe that modern Christian or Jewish theology is outside our scope. (They are</page><page sequence="6">The Literature "Core" at the State University of Iowa 209 ture in the first twelve books (he calls them chap ters, and his instinct is sound). We try to show him the closely knit plot of the last half: the planning and the accomplishment of the hero's rehabilitation in Ithaca. When he grasps the plan by which Homer has joined the two, he will know from his own reading experience how an epic poem is made. Then we hope he will be curious about how the world, and the men and women and gods and goddesses in it, all looked to a leader of the Heroic Age, specifically to a wily Greek among wily Greeks in a world full of dangerous men and dangerous nature. We want him to observe what such a man, what such an age and civilization, thought most worth while in life. We trust him to see, with a few hints, even through a prose translation, that the author was a poet and looked at the world with a poet's fervor and imagination. We read Greek tragedy because it unites in tensive comment on the issues of human life with dramatic and literary art intrinsically excellent and of central importance in the Western tradi tion. But we approach it empirically and induc tively, not as from on high. The student is led to see the unified structure and concentration of a Greek tragedy: simple and sequential in the Prometheus; complicated but tightly wrought, not confused, in Oedipus the King; less involved ma terially but more intricate psychologically in the Hippolytus. And though Prometheus is a myth and a demigod, the student can see him as Aeschylus saw him: a partially ? the "partially" is important ? successful champion of human rights against tyranny. Young men are not today, if they ever were, outside of Freud, afraid that they may murder their fathers and marry their mothers. But they promptly recognize in Oedipus a supreme example of one of the perennial ironies of life: how a man may, in spite of ? nay, through ? his very efforts to avoid catas trophe, run right into it. The Hippolytus offers the ubiquitous and modern theme of frustra tion in love and its consequences. But it offers more than that. The young and noble Hippolytus ? more than the youngish and noble Oedipus, yet like him; more than the young-minded Prome theus, but like him, too ? the idealistic Hippoly tus is too absolute and arrogant in his righteous ness. This is another way of mentioning that important intellectual subtlety of characterization in Greek tragedy known to the classicist as hybrh. It is an important insight; and it is not beyond our students in concrete presentation. In Plato, we read the group of dialogues that together give us a full-face portrait of Socrates. The Euthyphro is a perfect example of the Athe nian gadfly stinging the complacent citizen. The dialogue is short, single-minded, sustained. Its failure to "find the answer" is characteristic, surely, of Socrates' provocative questioning of his fellows. This circular pursuit of a definition is at least as good an exercise of the kind as you will find in some modern textbooks that aim at the same intellectual discipline. Contrary to some opinions, it is not vitiated by verbalism. As far as it goes, it is perfectly solid. And it leaves the problem at the right place, having cleared away the cobwebs. From there on the instructor and student are free to take the road of behaviorism, or the road of idealism, or the middle way of "moderate realism." Any ultimate definition of a moral quality (religion is the term in the Euthy phro) involves one of these positions. Which is right we do not know. But this dialogue is more than an exercise in logical definition; if it were not it would not belong in a literature course. Like the other dialogues we read, it is a work of art. It has a strong and dramatic motivation: the two speakers have the keenest incentive to seek a definition of religion. For Euthyphro has just indicted his father for homicide in a doubtful case, and So crates is going to be tried in a few days on a charge of atheism. The conversation, happily real istic in appearance, is as far from a record of actual talk as the dialogue in a good modern play or short story. And characterization, accomplished entirely within the dialogue, is likewise adequate: the polite, ironical, unpretentious but probing,</page><page sequence="7">210 The Tournai of General Education undogmatic but persistently questioning Socrates over against the cocksure but mentally careless, eventually disturbed Euthyphro. If the student reads the dialogue in this way he will enjoy it. And he will understand better why the Athenians were anxious about getting rid of Socrates. He will be ready for the Apology. I shall not offer an analysis of this great and familiar classic. I shall only repeat that our students do not abandon literary art when they study its firm organization, its ordered selectivity, its modulation of scale and tone, its sense of emphasis. And this defense of free speech, free thought, and free religion ? offered by a man on trial for his life ? surely this speech does not strike our students as a raid on the department of philosophy. Phil osophical premises and implications it certainly has; but it is not abstract logic. It is applied philosophy, if you will; and applied philosophy is the very stuff of literature. Of such also is the Crito, where the question is whether the condemned Socrates ought to escape from prison. This, too, is literature on the same terms as the Euthyphro and the Apology. It raises a question of permanent interest, I hope, in our civilization. I think our students are right when they read it in this way; when they think of, say, pacifists or ? on the other side ? those Americans who forfeit citizenship by joining a foreign army at the behest of conscience. But we protect the student against na?ve and uninformed transfer; we explain how the Athenian state was not Amer ica, or any modern state. One example: few Americans, for practical reasons, and few Euro peans, for legal as well as practical reasons, are free to pick up and emigrate when they like; and this is one of the premises of Socrates' argument. Of the Phaedo we read only the opening and the close: the account of Socrates' last day and death. We read the Protagoras for its full-length portrait of Socrates in competition ? highly dramatic and quite literarily motivated ? and conflict with the other intellectuals of Athens, the sophists or college professors. Of this rich dis cussion of the relation between knowledge and conduct, I will say only that it is both philosophy and applied. To our students it does not seem at all remote from reality. Well, then, do we inculcate the gospel of So crates according to Saint Plato? What about in doctrination, here and throughout the three core courses? The choice of a text ? any text ? is an act of indoctrination. By adopting the text we say ipso facto that it contains ? that it is ? something which we want the student to come in contact with. In this course, for instance, we have said that we want the student to know some books from the Bible and from Greek literature. We believe that he can understand and enjoy them, that they can be integrated as elements of his mind, personality and character. In the time allotted, they are the best literature that we can find ? and teach ? in two great blocks of the Western tradition. How the student will react to them ? whether he will accept or reject or trans form or reinterpret or apply them ? all that we leave to him. We help the student to understand Amos and Socrates; we do not champion their views. Once understood, they must do that for themselves; whether they win or lose is up to the student. We say only: he ought to meet them. For example, I often suggest, as an optional topic for a required essay, "The Case for the Athenians against Socrates" or "The Case for the Pharisees against Jesus" ? and I've had takers, too! To sum it up: our attitude as teachers is both sym pathetic and critical; we strive for a creative rather than a passive neutrality. LITERATURE CORE 2: ENGLISH AND AMERICAN AUTHORS The Canterbury Tales (edited by Howard and Wilson, Prentice Hall) or Chaucer's Complete Works (edited by Robinson, Hough ton Mifflin) : Parts of the Prologue; Pardoner's Prologue and Tale; Prioress's Tale; Wife of Bath's Prologue; Nun's Priest's Tale Shakespeare: Richard II; Henry IV, Part 1; Hamlet; Much Ado About Nothing. Seven Centuries of Verse (edited by Smith, Scribners)</page><page sequence="8">The Literature "Core" at the State University of Iowa 211 Twain: Huckleberry Pinn Fielding, Joseph Andrews Thoreau, Waiden, or Melville, Moby Dicky or Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter As already indicated, an identical spirit informs our teaching in all three courses in the Literature Core. It is manifest, from the list of texts above, that we do not undertake a "survey" of English or American literature. Nor, of course, does the term "authors" in our catalogue title mean that the approach is biographical. ("Masterpieces," which some of us use unofficially, invites invidious comparisons ? as though these, and no others, were the permanent and irreplaceable great books of our literature.) Our center is the human mean ing, interest, and value of the texts, a center between the ivory tower of "art for art's sake" and the steel tower of art for righteousness' sake. We exclude nothing arbitrarily: history, literary his tory, aesthetic theory, philosophy; all are laid under contribution. But the r?le of each is func tional, as the educators say; they are to illum inate and so make more significant the texts be fore the student. In learning to read Chaucer adequately he will necessarily be inducted in some measure into medieval life and culture; but we do not teach Chaucer in order to make him a medievalist. Quite the other way around: he be comes a bit of a medievalist in the process of reading Chaucer. He cannot get at the meaning of Shakespeare's plays or apprehend the qualities of his poetry without going some distance into the world of the Renaissance. But he does not study Shakespeare primarily to find out about the six teenth century. For the modern student of litera ture in general education, the sixteenth century, as such, has passed on; but Shakespeare ? the Shakespeare he ought to read ? abides. In sum, we neither cut off the dog's tail nor let it wag the dog. Too many people who encountered Chaucer's "Prologue in high school or sophomore English re call in later life only the opening line, "Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote." They remem ber that the instructor faithfully annotated Chaucer's account of the twenty-nine pilgrims, and perhaps that one or two of the tales were eventually read. But often the content of what should have been an experience of poetry, of nar ration and description and lyrical expression, has evaporated, partly because it was buried under a heavy weight of unintegrated facts. For the Prologue, neither dull nor static, may well seem to be both to the freshman or sophomore com pelled to pace off its eight hundred lines at the rate of twenty each day. Hence, after reading the first forty-two lines, in which the pilgrimage is announced, we (or some of us, at least) turn at once to the description of the Pardoner and then go on to his account of himself in the Pardoner's Prologue and then to his tale. Thus the student very early makes the intimate acquaintance of this lively rascal, sees him in characteristic action, and listens to his sure-fire telling of one of this old world's best stories. The reader is face to face, immediately and concomitantly, with medieval civilization, medieval religion (or some of its abuses), vivid and exciting humanity, and excel lent narrative. If the instructor uses any judg ment at all, the beginning student, innocent of the Middle Ages, of Chaucer, and perhaps of lit erature, will be bound to acknowledge that this man spins a good yarn. That is half the battle, in teaching any piece of literature. Then ? not until then ? he can be interested in the reasons why it is a good story. At that point his progress in literary study may become conscious though painless. Next, we think it best to read the Prioress's Tale. Though utterly unlike the Pardoner's nar rative, it, too, is a short, simple, highly concen trated story. First, to be sure, we turn back to the General Prologue for the account of the narrator. Then the Prioress's own prologue to the tale, which is rather difficult, is read to the class and explained by the instructor. The tale itself is relatively easy Middle English; the student can handle it for himself in a single assignment. To do so affords him a satisfying sense of accom</page><page sequence="9">212 The Journal of General Education plishment, as well as serving the best interests of literary appreciation. Meeting this example of medieval piety, the student gains, further, a new experience of religion ? a human, not merely a medieval facet of life. That it cannot be dupli cated in those terms in his own life is no objection ? quite the contrary. (Odysseus' interviews with Athene or Nausicaa will not be duplicated in the student's life either.) A possible objection is the theme of anti-Semitism which the tale involves. But we think it well for the student to learn that this is not exclusively a problem of the twentieth century. Having discovered that Chaucer is a good story teller, who can be both light and serious, the student is prepared to let the unhurried Wife of Bath take her time with him. He should be ready, before she is through, to recognize a comic char acter as great as those in Shakespeare or Dickens. And he will begin to experience something of the nature of literary humor, comedy, and irony ? whether he uses those terms or not. Now, having grown into the stature of a reader of Chaucer, he will be ready for that leisurely, elaborate, subtle ? but juicy ? masterpiece, the Nun's Priest's Tale. And if the farthest range of the cosmic comic spirit remains beyond him, there is still much within his grasp. Chaucer has many levels; as a tale of a cock and a hen, the piece is available to all readers. As has been intimated, we read Chaucer in his own English. (A single experiment was enough to convince us that far more is lost than gained by the use of a modernized version.) There is ample time for the instructor to read a large part of the text aloud; the students imitate his example, if not often in individual performance, at any rate regularly as a group. This provides a great deal of auditory experience and has proved adequate in a course not designed to produce specialists in Middle English. Chaucer's grammatical forms cause little difficulty; and the student is en couraged to use the editorial aids, the glossary, and his own enterprise in dealing with the diction and phrasing. Students respond readily with the necessary effort, once they understand that the purpose is not to learn a "foreign language" but to read some good stories accurately. In Shakespeare's Richard II the student meets an Elizabethan play, a kind of drama different, in ways that are pointed out to him, both from the Greek tragedy that he may have encountered in Literature Core 1 and from the plays he may know in the modern theater. He will follow the for tunes of a king surrounded by powerful and am bitious noblemen ? circumstances that the in structor must help him to understand and appraise. But above all he makes the intimate acquaintance of a man, a man who is a poet, a dreamer, an unconscious egotist, something of a sentimentalist. This man, highly gifted in feeling and imagina tion, is brought into conflict with a smooth, efficient, hard-headed politician. Both characters are endowed by the dramatist with an extra ordinary, a unique capacity for self-expression and for objective analysis. Through their utter ances they reveal themselves to us. But they do more than that. They reveal us to ourselves; they thus make articulate for the student areas of his own humanity and personality previously undis covered. He sees not only why Richard fails when tested against Bolingbroke, but also how man may fail when tested by life; and also how the man, or thing, that wins may be in some ways less noble or admirable than that which fails. Space forbids a survey of the broader canvas and richer contrasts of Henry IV, Part 1, or of Hamlet, the fullest of all Shakespeare's studies of man thinking and acting amid the greatest issues of life. Neither here nor in Much Ado About Nothing do we neglect Shakespeare in his r?le of entertainer. Without dictating the answer in ad vance, we analyze the question whether Falstaff is greater than a favorite radio comedian, whether the dialogue of Benedick and Beatrice is brighter than that in a current movie hit. Perhaps our efforts may be summed up by saying that we try to make the student more eager to see Shakespeare on the stage and more able, as well as more eager, to read him in the study.</page><page sequence="10">The Literature "Core?* at the State University of Iowa 213 Our other texts in this course are less firmly established in the program. This year we are re placing Swift's Gulliver's Travels by a group of narrative and lyric poems. Probably two American books will continue to have a place; Huckleberry Finn has long been used, Waiden was read for a year or two, and now Moby Dick and The Scarlet Letter are under consideration. Although the course would lack proportion without texts from Ameri can literature, our aim here is not to "represent" some period or phase of national history but ? as elsewhere ? to read books of permanent as well as present human meaning and relevance. Without diminishing the student's enjoyment of Mark Twain's novel as a fine tale of adventure along the Mississippi, we try to show him that it is also a book with deep and far-reaching insight into human relationships. We point out that Thoreau and Hawthorne not only wrote admirable prose but also studied the problem of man in Nature and man in Society. Melville's story of the whale will captivate him; we aim to guide him through at least some phases of Ahab's Hamlet like struggle with the problem of evil. We hope to make ? too often, of course, we must try to make over ? his reading of poetry into some thing beyond a classroom task. If he comes to see it first as revealing and illuminating his own life and experience, the victory is won. For through out this course ? or any other ? it is only thus that literature can become what it must become for all students, a thing of beauty and a joy forever.

Hence it has been given, counting last summer, just five times so far. The idea of the course was adopted by majority rather than unanimous vote of the Literature Core staff. Some of us thought it unwise to put a few necessarily rather arbi trarily chosen works of the last three-quarters of a century on a par ? so far as requirements and credits are concerned ? with classics chosen from the cumulative centuries of the past. Others of us felt more strongly the claims of the present. The wish to meet, or at least approach, the stu dent "on his own ground" played a part. We all hope, of course, that this direct contact with the literature of his own epoch will lead the student into better reading both of modern and older literature. As is apparent, we take the modern patterns (note that we do not say "contemporary") as beginning with the great Russian novelists of the nineteenth century, with Ibsen and his successors in the drama, with de Maupassant and the French realists in the short story, and in poetry in the English language ? a bit of a leap here ? with the third decade of the twentieth century. As in the other core courses, we chose the best books we could find ? and teach. We thought Joyce's Ulysses and the novels of Proust too difficult for most students. And brief experience showed that it was better to help the student read other poems of Eliot and Yeats than to read "The Wasteland" and "Byzantium" at him. But aside from the best books, we felt an obligation to introduce our students to the dom inant forms of literature in our time. Hence we begin with short stories. I doubt seriously whether any of these half dozen will be found on any final</page><page sequence="11">214 The Tournai of General Education list of great works of literature. But it is beyond question that most of our graduates will read more short stories after they leave college than anything else. Now these are at any rate good stories; and each shows clearly a particular kind of thing that the short story can do. We teach them both for their individual sakes and as examples. We expect the students to analyze each in structure, social milieu, style, theme, characterization, and implicit attitude. Without trying to turn him into a professional critic, we try to make him aware of the technique which is responsible for the unique pleasure that each story can give. In the drama our practice is essentially similar. Here, of course, the winnowing wind of time has blown a little longer. Hedda Gabler and Candida, at least, are a possession for the future as well as the present. And the student who has analyzed as well as enjoyed his way through the rest should be a better play-goer and a more critical movie goer than he would be without the experience. A number of the Russian novels of the last century are by way of becoming classics. Crime and Punishment we thought excellent in itself, eminently teachable, fully representative, yet not too long, like some Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. In the good sense as well as the bad ? in the modern sense, at any rate ? these novelists begin where the great English Victorians leave off. The sociological and psychological portraiture of Crime and Punishment is a new kind of ex perience for the reader brought up on Dickens or his imitators. And this Russian novel is a guide and gauge for the student exploring the serious fiction of the twentieth century. At any rate, it has been the most successful item in the course to date. I cannot predict the permanence of the other two novels in the course. A Passage to India is one of the subtlest and most discerning modern novels in the language. It offers analyses and insights, moreover, on the problems of race (Indian), re ligious experience, and psychological integrity. It pictures a world where Western standards, and "Western logic, do not work, and it is a readable novel in which events are used symbolically. Last year, further, we read The Grapes of Wrath. I think the students liked it, but a number of the instructors found it inferior or already familiar to their classes; hence Malraux this year, on which no report is yet available. For this niche we tried, however, to find a suitable novel dealing with rather massive social, political, or economic problems. We spend about six weeks on modern poetry. This has centered on Frost, Eliot, and the later Yeats. Here, though two of these are living men and the third but lately dead, we feel on safer ground. For it seems likely that these three poets have a definite place ? certainly not permanently fixed ? but still a place in the canon of poetry in the English language. What is more, the stu dent who has learned to read them can read con temporary poetry as a whole. So we teach them to read poems as poems and as everything else that the text invites. Some of us move from light to heavy Frost and thence to light Eliot or light Yeats and finally to heavy Eliot and Yeats. Others plunge right in where the water is coldest and traverse the pool according to one plan or another. Our students, of course, have been accustomed to sentiment, but not to subtlety; to overstate ment, not understatement; to poetic hope or poetic pathos, not to poetic bitterness or irony; to a one-two-three narrative or expository pattern, but not to any other kind of organic structure. We try to help them fill in these gaps in their capacity for reading poetry. On tests and in essays we ask for comprehensive, over-all discus sions of short poems. Or, at the end of the term, they may be presented with an imitation of Eliot by MacLeish and asked to explain (1) who might conceivably have written the poem ? Eliot, Frost, or Yeats ? and why; and (2) why neither of the other two is a good guess. On the whole, our attempt to teach modern poetry is the most strenuous and probably the most demonstrably successful part of the Introduction to Modern Literature.</page></plain_text>
