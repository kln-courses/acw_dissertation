<plain_text><page sequence="1">MADE FOR EACH OTHER: A SYMBIOSIS OF BIRDS AND PINES. By Ronald M. Lan- ner, Oxford Univ. Press, New York, New York. 1996: 160 pp., 14 chapters, 24 figures, 8 tables, and 15 color photographs on 4 plates. $35.00 (cloth).-This slim book interweaves a description of symbiosis on a "grand scale" between some corvids and over twenty spe- cies of pines across "vast tracts of North American and Asian wildland" with the co- evolutionary story of the Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) of the western United States. The author makes the case that the nut- cracker-pine relationship is a strong mutual- ism because nutcrackers are the most impor- tant dispersal agents of the pine seeds and the pine seeds are a nutrient-rich food essential for nutcracker survival. The critical message, delivered in the final chapter, "Is the Keystone Slipping?," is an alert that serious threats to the whitebark pine may diminish populations of the nutcracker and other animal species that depend on the pine seeds. This is a book for pine lovers. To support his argument for the mutualism between cor- vids and pines, Lanner examines the phylog- eny, comparative morphology, and ecology of pines, particularly the 35 species of "soft pines" in the subgenus Strobus. This group of species has a high proportion of species with wingless seeds: a critical adaptation to dis- persal by corvids. The five species of stone pines-Eurasian and one North American- that are close mutualists with the Eurasian (Nucifraga caryocatactes) and Clark's nut- crackers receive the most attention. Charac- teristics of stone pine cone fertilization and development, and seed germination and nutri- tional content, are described in detail. Some of these descriptions are less relevant to the main thesis of the book than others, but they provide a rich natural history. A review of the family Corvidae quickly focuses on the "pine birds": the nutcrackers and the Pinyon Jay (Gymnorhinus cyanoce- phalus). "Pine bird" adaptations to a diet of pine seeds are long bills, the ability to carry numbers of pine seeds, and well-developed spatial memory for retrieving cached seeds. The foundation for the pine-corvid mutualism, including experimental evidence that Clark's Nutcrackers use fixed objects as visual cues to find food caches, is provided primarily by the research of Diana Tomback, Stephen Van- der Wall, Russell Balda, and Lanner's own work on seed dispersal by birds. Lanner is careful to point out that nutcrackers are not completely dependent on a single species of pine. He notes that nutcrackers use a variety of other pine seeds and foods and migrate (ir- rupt) when the pine seed crop fails. However, nestlings are fed pine nuts that were cached almost exclusively, and cached foods are used extensively during fall, winter, and spring when other foods are scarce. In Lanner's view winged pine seeds are an- cestral to wingless seeds, and corvids provide the selection pressure to make this transition. He presents a scenario for evolution of wing- less seeds in two groups of closely related pine species: the P. ayachuite-strobifomis- flexilis complex in Mexico and the western United States and the P. parviflora complex in eastern Asia. Pine seeds cached by corvids</page><page sequence="2">298 THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 111, No. 2, June 1999 are less likely to dessicate and more likely to germinate than seeds dispersed by the wind. Therefore, in drier climates, characteristics in pines that enhance dispersal by corvids-ver- tical fruiting branches, sessile cones, non- opening "breakaway" scales, seed-retaining cone cores, and large, wingless seeds-would be advantageous. Lanner's two main theses-whitebark pine depends on Clark's Nutcracker for effective seed dispersal, and the whitebark pine is a keystone species-superficially seem difficult to reconcile. Many animal species (birds, squirrels, and bears) extract, move, and eat whitebark pine seeds (the keystone concept), but the nutcracker is essentially the only agent of seed dispersal (a tight mutualism). The final chapter ("Is the Keystone Slipping?") pre- sents the case that whitebark pine is a species upon which Clark's Nutcracker, red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) depend to varying degrees. The whitebark pine is seriously threatened by "competition from more shade-tolerant trees due to fire exclusion; heightened bark beetle attacks, also engendered by fire exclusion; loss of habitat through global warming; and quick death from a parasitic fungus." If these threats severely diminish populations of whitebark pine, over the long term and in a diffuse ways, the nutcracker, and to a lesser extent, the red squirrel and grizzly bear will suffer. The writing is clear and the pace brisk. Fig- ures and tables are used judiciously and the plates are excellent. Some readers may object to instances of anthropomorphism ("White- bark pine takes its seeds very seriously indeed when it comes to distributing the tree's re- sources.") and unabashedly adaptationist in- terpretations, but this is perhaps expected in a book directed to a general readership. Details of pine phylogeny and the uses of pine nuts by people help to flesh out the story. I heartily recommend this book to all interested in good natural history writing and forest ecology in particular.-R. TODD ENGSTROM.</page></plain_text>
