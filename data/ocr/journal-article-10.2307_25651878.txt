<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER CHAMETZKY Global Art, National Values, Monumental Compromises: "German" 9/It Commemoration in America, "American" Holocaust Commemoration in Germany 1. introduction: shifting meanings Consider first a thing, its logo, and its public image: a New Balance running shoe (fig. 1). Wearing this in America probably indicates that, like me, you have feet wider than a D (double E in my case), and so make the utilitarian decision in favor of athletic footwear sized by width as well as length. In Germany, though, this clunky, functional brand has been adopted by some trendy right-extremist youths?the nationale Jugend?as the shoe to wear, not for its width, but for its logo. In that milieu, the obstinately unimaginative "N" on the side of the shoe is a sign of neo-Nazi beliefs, declaring extreme and xenophobic nationalism almost clandestinely and with an informal, sporty, inflection.1 The anthropologist Arjun Appadurai has observed that "globalization involves the use of a variety of instruments of homogenization (armaments, advertising techniques, language hegemonies, and clothing styles) which are absorbed into local political and cultural economies, only to be repatriated as heterogeneous dialogues of national sovereignty, free enterprise, and fundamen talism in which the state plays an increasingly delicate role."2 This general insight specifically applies to the transformation of the New Balance "N" into a nationalist icon in the Oberlausitz (Upper Lusatia, located in eastern Saxony, east of Dresden), from which also ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ follows the seeming ? ^^^^^^^^^^^I^^^^^^^^^^^^H viewed, a Bloomian ^P^|^^^^B^^^^9^^^^^^^^^H "strong-misreading"?of disoriented K ft^^HM^. * iMSI^^^^^^I youths who seek group identity by ji^1^^^^*^ *l35fcH^TP5BII^H staging pagan rituals in the search for ^K^^^ V W^uSf^t^^l /^^H some mythic ur-Germanic soul, ff^C^ ^^W^T^J^^^l z^iH^I Fig. 1 New Balance athletic shoe collection of the author ^^^HHHIH^^^IHHI^I^HHHHII^H^HHH 155</page><page sequence="2">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW while at the same time adopting as one of their symbols a foreign-designed and produced, globally available commercial logo. Despite the much discussed globalization of markets and values that renders New Balance and any number of products and images equally available from Carbondale, Illinois, to Bautzen im Oberlausitz, from Berlin to Mumbai, local attitudes, customs, conceptions and misconceptions, and, especially, still-active histories inher ited from the past continue to produce discursive sites determining hetero geneous ways in which internationally exchanged and globally available objects, images, and ideas are received and interpreted. Art, too, has long been a global system, in which comparable instances of international migration and local reception and adaptation can be observed. The meanings of artworks, images, and ideas also often shift with their move ment from one place, or site, to another, as well as with their movements through time. Rapidly shifting physical and discursive contexts has character ized modern and postmodern art. With such shifts come shifts in meaning: not an essential aspect of the work of art, but an interpretive field, generated in discourse. When that discourse seeks to define appropriate objects and images as focal points for national memory and mourning, the shifts that take place can demand obfuscation of origins, suppression of discordant voices, and compromise of any focused and coherent artistic conception. 2. GERMANY TO AMERICA: LIGHT EFFECTS Consider now the September 24, 1936, spread from the German picture magazine Illustrierter Beobachter (fig. 2). This page presents the famous Lichtdom, or Cathedral of Light, designed by Albert Speer for the 1936 Reichsparteitag on the Zeppelin Field in Nuremberg, an effect he staged there from 1934 to 1938, and at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin in 1936. These illuminated spectacles were designed to captivate and enthrall live partici pants as well as to be photogenic for both moving and still photographers. In 1937 the architectural critic Wilhelm Lotz wrote, "The designer has in the service of the requisite image used here one more building material for the first time on this scale, namely directed light in the form of floodlights," and went on to describe approvingly how these effects created "the requisite image" to impact Hitler's speech positively.3 Speer had begun using mass illumination at the 1934 Parteitag, "ringing the field with 130 searchlights, which proved visible to a height of 20,000-25,000 feet," the effect of which Speer described as "a vast room, with the beams serving as mighty pillars of infinitely light outer walls."4 Designed to stage the illusionary transformation of the class- and regionally fragmented German masses into one Volk, Speer s light shows also garnered international admiration. In 1936 The NewYork 156</page><page sequence="3">Peter Chametzky Times characterized the effect of searchlights being turned from the sky to the parade of gilded eagle standards as "indescribably beautiful."5 Speer's grandiose effects didn't represent German architecture's first use of light as a temporary building material. As both Kathleen James Chakraborty and Janet Ward have shown, one characteristic of Weimar architectural practice, especially in Berlin, was the spectacular commercial use of electric illumination. These displays took place in the great depart ment stores and movie theaters of 1920s Berlin, as well as in commercial and civic boostering celebrations such as the 1928 "Berlin in Light" (fig. 3). Berlin's 1920s commercial illuminations sought to establish the city as a Weltstadt on the level of Paris, the nineteenth century's "City of Light," London, with its glittering Piccadilly Circus, and, especially, "The Great White Way," of New York. According to Ward, "Germany's ultimate interwar self-salvaging attempt through electric aggrandizement occurred with the 'Berlin in Light' (Berlin im Licht) week of October 13-16, 1928, when for four nights a full illumination of the city's monuments and commercial buildings was staged by the city's major retail association (Verein der Kaujleute und Industriellen). 'Light is Life,' proclaimed the Osram electric company's adornment of the Siegessdule (Victory Column), clad with a sixty-six-foot high surface of electric light."6 Fig. 2 Illustrierter Beobachter, 24 Sept. 1936, photo: courtesy Christopher Phillips, ICP Der JiustoterteBeobwiifc^ EreifnteetntfksMn ^^^^^^^^^^H VeransiaihntendesPartdteees derEhre: . ^^^^^^^^^^^^B ^si&amp;^s^^ flHIIIHflilHIIIHHH ' * I ' 157</page><page sequence="4">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW 9 j Fig. 3 (7e/*^ "Berlin in Light. Light is Life," Siegessaule (Victory Column), Berlin, as wuminated by the Osram electric company, October 1928, photo: Landesarchiv Berlin Fig. 4 (right) Siegessaule, Berlin, contemporary photograph The Nazis, as in many realms, adopted existing formal and technical ideas and adapted them to their own ideological ends. This becomes evident in the images and format of the Illustrierter Beobachter, the "Illustrated Observer," the picture magazine companion to the Nazi party newspaper, Vblkischer Beobachter, and the inheritor of the techniques pioneered in Weimar-era publications such as the Mosse Press Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung, and the communist Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung for which John Heartfield produced his devastating photomontages. In the case of spectacular light effects, the Nazis could claim to have "repatriated" effects used by Jewish department store owners such as Tietze and Wertheim, and often designed by Jewish architects such as Eric Mendelsohn. In Mein Kampf, James Chakraborty points out, "Hitler deplored the urban prominence of depart ment stores, whose architectural magnificence unjustly surpassed, he believed, that of Germany's cultural and other civic institutions."7 In each of these cases, the spectacle of hght was a tool. Its appeal as an ideological 158</page><page sequence="5">Peter Chametzky instrument across the political spectrum derived from its combination of the promise of beneficial technological progress with atavistic sacral associations: culture moving forward to the past. As James-Chakraborty argues, many twentieth-century German architects, from all political positions, were inter ested in employing such spectacles. The socialist Bruno Taut, for instance, used glass and light to invoke an idea that his colleague, the science fiction writer Paul Scheerbart, called the "City Crown" (Stadtkrone), glittering crys talline towers that would function as public rallying points, like the great Gothic cathedrals, but now in the service of secular, communalist goals. The aestheticization of politics, as Benjamin warned in the famous last lines of "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility," was one of fascism's tactics, and the research and development phase had been modernity itself, which created aestheticized venues for ritualized mass con sumption, such as department stores and movie palaces. But one should not ignore the possibility of alternative experiences, even within systems attempt ing with great success to generate hegemonic meanings. Early film spectator ship, for instance and as Miriam Hansen has shown, provided opportunities for counter-hegemonic responses.8 By the time of Benjamin s "Work of Art" essay (1936), given the example of Nazi Germany, there was good reason to doubt the critical acumen of the masses in resisting and refunctioning spectacles staged to give aesthetic form to fascist politics. Yet, in his essay "Berlin Childhood Around 1900," Benjamin recollected his own childhood experience of the Siegessaule that proclaims Germany's defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, celebrated each year in mass ceremonies performed on Sedan Day (fig. 4). In Benjamin's account, rather than a glorious victory col umn, the shaft was transformed into a mass gravestone: "With the defeat of the French world history seemed to have sunk into a glorious grave with which this column was topped and toward which the Siegesallee flowed."9 Benjamin was unwilling to give over to the imperial?or fascist?culture industry the power to totalize meanings within his own symbolic sphere. I believe that the more attentive we are to everyday life under fascism?or capitalism, or "real existing Socialism"?the more we become aware that alternative readings are available and have been and are being produced, no matter how carefully staged or designed the symbol or the spectacle. As the New Balance example with which I began shows, sign systems are not seamless, images are subject to further, ground-level interpretation? whether by ideologically focussed intellectuals or misdirected youths. I first saw this particular spread from the Illustrierter Beobachter in New York in spring 2002, at the International Center of Photography, included in an exhibition skillfully curated by Christopher Phillips on the "Rise of the Picture Press."10 Phillips astutely wove together both the left- and right-wing 159</page><page sequence="6">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW uses of photojournalism, documenting the availability of these techniques for use, and abuse, by regimes and individuals of any political persuasion. In NewYork in 2002 the pages from the Illustrierter Beobachter not only documented the history of German political and commercial spectacles, and graphic design, but also evoked a contemporary American memorial. From March 11 to April 13, 2002, the "Tribute in Light" illuminated the Manhattan sky (fig. 5), as it has since then for one night a year, on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks. "Tribute in Light" was the second title of this work, changed from "Towers of Light" (fig. 6), to appease qualms on the part of survivors that the shafts of light might be read as a commemoration of the fallen World Trade Center buildings, rather than a memorial to the human victims. The work of a collaborative team, "Tribute in Light" was composed of 887,000-watt search-lights deployed in "two 50-foot-square arrays on a lot bounded by Murray, West andVesey Streets."11 The Municipal Art Society coordinated the project. The designers were John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of Proun Space Studio in Manhattan, and, especially, Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, artists who had had studios on the 91st floor of one of the towers. These two collaborative pairs had come up with the idea simultaneously. They were joined in realizing the project by Richard Nash Gould, a NewYork architect, and Paul Marantz, of the architectural hghting firm of Fisher Marantz Stone. These principals were assisted by dozens of workers, and supported by grants from Deutsche Bank, AOL-Time Warner, and General Electric, which contributed cash and 100 xenon bulbs costing $1,200 each. Consolidated Edison donated the electricity. The project was tested for feasibility in Las Vegas. The image of light piercing high into the night sky, as Speer s "Cathedral of Light" already proclaimed by its name, evokes sacral associations. This was also true of the Trade Center Towers themselves, whose doubling recalled the twin towers of many Gothic cathedrals. Julia Kristeva once referred to them as" 'Notre-Dame' de l'argent" (our lady of money).12 In the "Tribute in Light," though, rather than ordaining a particular secular leader?or value?with divine powers, the light columns have been described as resembling a votive candle. Myoda described it as "a presence but ethereal rather than concrete," and LaVerdiere as "a temporal light that helps people come to terms with loss."13 As we have seen, spectacular light shows were used in Weimar, and in Nazi Germany?as they are, of course, at the opening of shopping centers across America, or for movie premieres. That these associations could be invoked, as well as Star Wars light sabers, and not just the specifically intended act of mourning for the victims of 9/11, did not seem to be an issue for the designers or sponsors of this work. Americans often portray discussions of the 160</page><page sequence="7">Peter Chametzky complexity of meaning and associations as useless dithering and a distraction from the practical imperative of simply getting something done. Perhaps the designers also believed that meaning is supplied by context. Perhaps they planted at ground zero itself an internal critique of the nationalist fervor unleashed by 9/11. Julian LaVerdiere (MFA,Yale, 1995), for instance, studied for his BFA at Cooper Union with the critical, political sculptor Hans Haacke, and was well aware of Speer s work as he designed his light show, though this debt went unacknowledged before the piece was executed and in its immediate reception.14 LaVerdiere seemed quite aware this would pass unnoticed in America: in 2003 he was quoted as saying, in reference to a Hugo Boss ad he had worked on that included references to Nazi architec ture, alluding to the firms past as a producer not only of Wehrmacht but also SS uniforms (and probably employing slave laborers): "Nine times out of ten, this esoterica would never be recognized, but at least it helps us believe that we are doing our part, rather than just making money."15 So soon after September 11, perhaps any other associations were super fluous?and any discussion of them would probably have been deemed disrespectful, if not downright unpatriotic.16 Instead, we were to see this as another aspect of an absolutely unique and unprecedented event?a creation at "ground zero," an absolute null point of human experience?a designation which itself, though, perhaps cynically or maybe unconsciously, links back to the destruction by American atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: The New York Times employed the term in reference to lower Manhattan by Fig. 5 "Tribute in Light," The New York Times, page 1, March 12, 2002, photo: Vincent Laforet/ The New York Times/Redux.

As will be noted in the next part of this essay, Fig. 7 Andy Warhol, Stadium, 1982, Acrylic and silkscreen on canvas, 90.2" x 70.1," ?The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY, photo: Courtesy Galerie Bruno Bischqfberger, Zurich. 162</page><page sequence="9">Peter Chametzky the ghost of Speer haunts many German monumental and memorial projects. I suspect it would also be taboo for a German sport shoe designer to offer without some controversy a product defined by a graphic "N" on the side. In both cases, meanings generated at ground level would have intruded on either the spectacle of ethereal, sacral transcendence of political and social realities intended by "Tribute in Light," or the functional corporate identity to which the trademarked "N"?the anti-Nike?aspires. Postmodernism revels in the death of originality and the mutability of meaning, as Andy Warhol demonstrated. Warhol leveled cultural hierarchies between popular and elite art and images, making over every "original" effect into available reproduction, and every available reproduction into an "original" Warhol. In 1982, when many German neo-Expressionist artists, such as Anselm Kiefer and Markus Liipertz, were using the language of indi vidualistic, affective painting to re-employ, deploy, and supposedly to disarm, populist Nazi imagery, Warhol resurrected Speer s "Cathedral of Light" for the 1936 Olympics, and brought it back to Germany in a new form, in a series of depersonalized and decontextualized silkscreen paintings innocuously titled Stadium and Reflection (fig. 7).These were shown in the 1982 Zeitgeist exhibition at the Martin Gropius Bau in West Berlin. If the Nazis aestheti cized politics (and formally, it has been claimed, they learned not only from Weimar architects, but also from American college football half-time shows, which Harvard man and future Nazi foreign-press secretary Ernst Hanfstaengl brought to Hitlers attention in the early 1920s),18 Warhol, by pulling this aesthetic effect out of an overtly politicized context, "repatriated" it to the world of art itself as ideology, defusing its intended affect, and stealing its ide ological thunder. The fetishization of the Fuhrer becomes the fetishization of the image and the commodity?exposing the connection between the two as strategies?as Warhol's print freezes the light show and makes it available for purchase. Nazi populist propaganda is re-presented as value-free, though valuable, Pop Art. 3. NEW YORK TO BERLIN AND BACK AND BEYOND: MEMORIAL SITINGS Rosalind Krauss has argued that the detachment of sculpture from a particular place is characteristic of modernism.19 She locates the rootless, "nomadic" nature of modern sculpture, in contrast to earlier periods, in Rodin's revi sion of sculpture's traditional role of creating monuments to fit formally within particular spaces and thematically into histories associated with their surroundings. Rodin's bronzes could be cast in multiple versions, disengaging their connection to a particular place. Perhaps in response to this devaluation 163</page><page sequence="10">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW of place in relation to object, in the late 1960s minimalist sculptors, especially in New York, began to think, first, of the gallery itself as an active location (and for this there were modernist precedents, especially in Soviet Constructivism), and then to move beyond the gallery and into the "real world," to create pub He, site-specific works. Richard Serra's work provides classic examples of site specificity. In Serra's conception, site specificity derives from the physical placement of an object in space that leads to the phenomenological alteration of that space and of the thing itself in the presence of the viewer: The specificity of site-oriented works means that they are conceived for, dependent upon, and inseparable from their locations. The scale, the size, and the placement of sculptural elements result from an analysis of the particular environmental components of a given context. The pre Hminary analysis of a given site takes into consideration not only formal but also social and political characteristics of the site. Site-specific works invariably manifest a judgment about the larger social and poHtical con text of which they are a part. Based on the interdependence of work and site, site-specific works address their context, entering into a dia logue with their surroundings.20 In this passage Serra was both generaUy explaining his practice, and specificaUy objecting to the removal of his 1981 Tilted Arc from Federal Plaza in New York in 1989, which, according to the artist and his supporters, con stituted its destruction. Serra and his work acknowledge the "social and political characteristics" of a site. This was especiaUy true after the Tilted Arc controversy, which took place in the context of the transition from the Carter to the Reagan presidencies, and was spurred on by political appointees and, towards the end, by the so-caUed "culture wars" that marked the end of the 1980s and controversies surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts and public support for the work of artists such as Karen Finley, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Andres Serrano. Though Serra wants his works to impact the "social and political char acteristics of the site," they generaUy avoid evocation of a site's history, of space as always already filled with accumulated perceptions and sensations, and of viewers (or spectators) as themselves a diverse coUection of individ uals, each possessing a distinct history and identity.21 Tilted Arc, for instance, was plotted in relationship to the faceless office building behind it, by which it intended to put a face?a dissatisfied one?on the office work ers entering and leaving each day. Their progress through the plaza was to be disrupted, whereby their perception of their own place in space, and, by association, their status as cogs in a bureaucratic mechanism, was to be heightened. In Thomas Crow's formulation, this was a "strong site specific" 164</page><page sequence="11">Peter Chametzky work, one that disrupted its surroundings to such a degree that its very existence there was deemed unbearable.22 Crow holds that Serra's work, rather than being destroyed, was in fact finished by its removal, and that Serra's defense on the grounds of artistic freedom betrays a lack of under standing of the implications of his own work. In recent years there has been a move on the part of both artists and crit ics to expand the notion of site specificity beyond a physical place. A site, accordingly, could constitute an institutional structure, such as "the museum" in general and not a specific building, or, a discursive site, such as "the art world," or "a world in which AIDS exists"?which is the site that precipi tated the attacks on Finley, Mapplethorpe, Serrano, and by association, Serra?and others at the end of the 1980s.23 In Germany, of course, the sum of events, actions, and all subsequent responses to it that are woefully inade quately designated by the term "Holocaust" (at least since the 1979 showing of the American mini-series of that name on German national television) forms the most obvious, pervasive and intractable discursive site for artists and others.24 The physical, in this case, can't be disregarded, though, since artworks, monuments and memorials evoke certain specific and variable aspects of that history by their presence in particular physical settings?most obviously at the sites of concentration camps, for instance?but also many other sites in Germany and across Central Europe. Serra's aesthetic is very significant for projects and problematics linking New York and Berlin. Serra collaborated with New York architect Peter Eisenman on the initial proposal for the massive monument ultimately approved to serve as the central German Holocaust memorial, "Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" (fig. 8). The memorial is sited at the conflu ence of historical, memorial, governmental, and commercial buildings, and one that since the 1990s has become a site too of dramatic contemporary architectural confrontations and competitions. It sits on the site of the former ministerial gardens, a five-acre plot located adjacent to the governmental and ceremonial centers of the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate, visible from the Reichstag roof as renovated by Norman Foster and the adjacent Embassies (most notably the new American Embassy that opened on July 4, 2008), scrutinized by the jutting windows of the Behrens Strasse facade of Frank Gehry's DG Bank, the new Adlon Hotel, and, historically, within the wall's former no-man's land and not far from the location of Hitler's and right over Goebbels's bunkers (fig. 9). In the essay "Germany's Holocaust Memorial Problem?and Mine," the influential theorist and historian of Holocaust memorials James Young recounts his turn from the position of critic?like Thomas Crow, privileg ing discourse over object?to active co-producer, invested in the actual 165</page><page sequence="12">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW Fig. 8 Eisenman Architects with Richard Serra, competition model "Waving Field of Pillars" realization of Germany's central Holocaust memorial at this site in Berlin.25 Others have already recounted in detail the long history of this monument's genesis and the many debates, discussions, symposia and anthologies devoted to it, which I will only sketch here.26 The process began in 1988, when the Berlin journalist Lea Rosh first put forward the idea for a central place of remembrance and mourning for, specifically, the Jewish victims of the Nazis ? an exclusivity that has been criticized?and reached one point of completion on June 25,1999, when the modified Eisenman project, from which Serra had since withdrawn, was approved by the Bundestag by a vote of 314 for, 209 against, with 14 abstentions. Young, who was appointed to the five-member commission that guided and judged the final competition from 1997 to 1999, and worked with Eisenman to revise his design (the revision precipitated Serra's withdrawal), has told this convoluted story very lucidly, with his telling privileged by his access to insider information and nuanced by his own movement from a monument skeptic to supporter. As a skeptic, he was doubtful about any Holocaust monument's ability to deal adequately with its subject; about the risk of perceived "closure" of reflection on an issue with which Germany should never be done; of the clanger of diverting attention, and funds, from 166</page><page sequence="13">Peter Chametzky Fig. 9 Eisenman Architects, "Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe," 2005, view towards Potsdamer Platz/Sony Center. Tiergarten at right, entrance to "Center of Information" to left. Photograph: Eisenman Architects. the many already-existing Holocaust memorial sites, monuments and ongo ing activities in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany. Finally, though, he came to the conclusion that with the move of the Federal Republic s capital to Berlin the monument was necessary, a position also advanced in an article in Die Zeit by Jiirgen Habermas.Young asks: Did I want Germany to return its capital to Berlin without publicly and visibly acknowledging what had happened the last time Germany was governed from Bedin? With its gargantuan, even megalomaniacal restoration plans and the flood of big-industry money pouring into the new capital in quantities beyond Albert Speer's wildest dreams, could there really be no space left for public memory of the victims of Berlin's last regime? How, indeed, could I set foot in a new German capital built on the presumption of inadvertent historical amnesia that new buildings also breed? As Adorno had corrected his well-intentioned but facile (and now hackneyed) "Nach Auschwitz..." dictum, maybe it was also time for me to come down from my perch of holy dialectics and take a position.27 The process by which the design was chosen, as Young describes it, seems not to have been far different from the way academic search committees work: from a large initial field of applicants, the five-member committee rather 167</page><page sequence="14">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW quickly eliminated those that seemed obviously unacceptable, such as Markus Lupertzs proposal for a twenty-foot-tall statue representing the biblical matriarch Rachel, in the nude?which, for one thing, male Hasidic Jews would not even be able to look at. After finding faults with the remaining short-listed entries, the committee settled on a few finalists who were given the opportunity to present themselves and their work. A couple of the short listed proposals and their "flaws": Dani Karavan proposed a field of flowers in the form of a yellow star. Flaw: the yellow star was an anti-Semitic emblem, thus commemorating the victims with a symbol created by their oppressors. Daniel Libeskind proposed a broken wall he called "Stonebreath," which Young says "evoked a spectacular vision of irreparability, irredeemable voids, and a scarred landscape." Flaw: lack of singularity and originality. According to Young: "Insofar as this seemed to be an extension of the void he had built into his Jewish Museum design, it also appeared to be an extension of the Jewish Museum itself, which already had a Holocaust void built into it."28 Finally, the commission had its two 1997 finalists: the German Gesine Weinmillers "Eighteen Scattered Sandstone Wall Segments" (fig. 10) and the Eisenman and Serra proposal, "Waving Field of Pillars" (figs. 9, ll).Weinniiller's proposal called for a three-sided plaza into which the visitor would descend, bordered on its lateral sides with tapered walls, in which eighteen more walls would be distributed. On the long wall opposite the open end would be inscribed historical text about the Holocaust. The relationship to the tapered and inscribed reflective wall of Maya Yang Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial is inescapable, though here, as Young points out, the text "would not presume to name all the victims of the crime but would name the crime itself."29 Bringing the viewer's movement into the piece into relationship with its theme and with the expanded site of the surrounding city also recalls Lin's wall, but formally this derivation also goes back to the work of Serra, and his site specific outdoor pieces such as the 1970-72 landscape work, Shift.30 The title of the Weinmillers proposal, though, was a canard: the 18 walls were not "scattered" but carefully plotted so that from a particular vantage ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ point they would reform in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B the eye ^^^H^^^^^^^pH^^^H^^^^^^H an iconic configuration, the ^^Hr m^^l^H^^Hl^^^^^H Star of David.

A last reason for the selection of the Eisenman and Serra proposal: the nationality and ethnicity (Eisenman s obvious Jewishness, Serra's less obvious) of the designers would cast this national memorial in an international context, demonstrating contemporary Germany's cosmopolitan attitude. The avoid ance of "Germanic" design solutions has been a tendency in many projects in Berlin, most dramatically in the Reichstag renovation, entrusted to the English architect Sir Norman Foster and Libeskind's Jewish Museum, build ings I've written about extensively elsewhere, and both hugely successful.31 But whereas one might most identify the minimalist monument proposed by Eisenman and Serra with American art, it is hard to imagine a similarly stark, untraditional, non-narrative, uninscribed monument being built at an equally important site and bearing commensurate commemorative weight in the United States. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had supported the building of a central Holocaust memorial, and reportedly favored the Eisenman and Serra design. According to some accounts his one reservation was that there were too many concrete columns.32 Opposition to the memorial in general and to this design 169</page><page sequence="16">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW in particular on the part of the incoming Social Democrats, and particularly Culture Minister Michael Naumann, became a significant issue during the 1998 election, and continued to be voiced after Gerhard Schroder's Social Democratic government assumed power. The grounds for this dissent were: 1. the Eisenman/Serra design recalled the monumental architecture of Albert Speer; 2. aesthetic beauty was inappropriate in the remembrance of the crimes of the Nazi state; 3. a memorial was inappropriate in any case; a cen tral Holocaust museum would be more useful.33 As I will discuss in closing, debates on the function of memorials, whether they should be purely sym bolic, and take one out of the everyday, or be informative and useful to everyday experience, also have a relatively long history in the United States that converges with German discussions over the Holocaust memorial. In response to these criticisms the winning Eisenman and Serra design was modified. The initial field of some 4000 columns ranging from about one half to five-and-one-half meters high, was reduced to 2,711 at a maximum height of about four meters. The western end was landscaped with trees to separate the site more from the developing urban environment adjacent to it and to connect it visually to the perimeter of the Tiergarten greensward across the street (fig. 9). Both these modifications also decreased the associa tions with Speers stark monumentalism. All of these alterations were totally unacceptable to Richard Serra, who withdrew his participation and name from the work.34 Eisenman, as an architect more used to accommodations to a client and less concerned with conceptual purity than Serra, assented to the changes and even added to them. The memorial opened to the public on May 9, 2005, exactly sixty years after the end of World War II and ten years after the opening of the first memorial competition. One above-ground aspect that still derives from Serra and his aesthetic convictions is the narrowness of the passage between the columns (fig. 11). This precludes groups, and even couples, from navigating the labyrinth together, at least side-by-side. Here, remembrance and mourning is to be an individual journey. This is very much Serra's conviction, independent of the function, or the site, of his work. Serra remains committed to the individual contemplation of form. This minimalist aesthetic employs geometric, machine-formed shapes bearing no resemblance to the human body. They thus depart from a millennial-old anthropomorphic sculptural convention, whether in representational form in premodern art, or in the abstracting work of modernists such as Henry Moore. Unlike these works, the minimal aesthetic does not provide surrogates for the body, but makes us conscious of our actual and individual body in its distinction from the inorganic presence that confronts it.

Whatever hmitations the memorial has, it is undoubtedly an impressive piece of contemporary sculpture, and an impressive commitment of symbolic and commercially valuable real estate to non-income-producing contemplation. Eisenman has described his inspiration for the field of uninscribed pillars not as the obvious gravestones (though he says it s fine if people make that association), classical stellae, M.C. Escher mazes, or minimahst sculptures, but in emphatically middle-American, indeed, Field of Dreams terms: "a field of corn that I was lost in in Iowa... I was trying to do something that had no center, had no edge, had no meaning, that was dumb." The art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto points out that here, at the center of myriad types of information and associations?governmental, commercial, historical? Fig. 12, Eisenman Architects, "Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe," winter 2006 171</page><page sequence="18">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW Eisenman planted "a black hole, a place intended to embody meaningless ness."35 However, Danto avers that this association "is brilliant but too much to ask of anyone." Michael Schmitz has argued that Eisenmans monument negotiates between the poles of "harmonizing" and "problematizing" Holocaust remembrance. "Harmonizers" view the murder of the Jews as one of many such events in history, comparable to Stalinist crimes or other genocides, while "problematizers" position it as totally unique event and the result of fundamental flaws in German character and culture, intractable and ultimately incomprehensible. The Eisenman memorial does not prescribe (or proscribe) either interpretation. It offers an open-ended, abstract, and experiential memorial experience, with no inscribed names, no aboveground explanatory text, no prescribed entrance or exit, and no particular path through it.36 The minimal form of each individual pillar calls for the spectator to answer its "theatrical" address with his or her own response.37 Response also depends much on climatic conditions: ones experience of a desolate memorial on a bleak, windy Berlin winter day is far different from that in a sun-drenched summer light, when visitors are likely to sunbathe on the columns, despite signs prohibiting such behavior. The most dramatic compromise, which Eisenman opposed but now shrugs off with the phrase "as an architect you win some and you lose some," was the underground "Center of Information" exhibition space (fig. 9).38 This space consists of five rooms that introduce you first to the historical devel opment of the so-called "final solution," and then sequentially to countries, families, and individuals decimated by it. Unlike the above-ground memorial, it is not dedicated solely to Jewish victims. Here, too, one senses a kind of compromise approach, balancing between what Young has defined as the German tendency to focus on impersonal causes and processes, and the American desire to personalize and individualize victims and evoke empathy in the spectator, as at the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington, where one receives a particular victim s ID card as companion through and keepsake of the exhibition experience. Another function of Berlin s infor mation center, though, is that unlike the field of pillars, it allows for tracking the number of visitors, according to DerTagesspiegel some 200,000 in the first three-and-a-half months it was open, from May to August 2005 (far more than were anticipated, leading to a budget deficit of 550,000 Euro) and 300,000 in its first seven months.39 Eisenman s initial individual proposal for a revised memorial that would inform textually would have been much more literal and obtrusive optically, but a bit more subtle in practical use than the Information Center: he pro posed that the memorial could also include a huge transparent building 172</page><page sequence="19">Peter Chametzky Fig. 13 "Spirit of the Doughboy," 1926, - Herrin, Illinois.

What we mean is that our words were attacked?our sauntering, freewheeling, raucous, stumbling, unbridled, unregulated, unorthodox words." For Rosenblatt, then, the attack on the Trade Center Towers was ultimately an attack on the First Amendment guarantee of free dom of speech, which libraries enshrine. Debates over useful versus purely symbolic memorials are not new. Andrew Shanken has recounted the history of debates in America after both World War I and World War II over the form that war memorials should take.41 After World War I the proponents of traditional, figurative, symbolic sculptures on pedestals won the debate, resulting in the ubiquitous "Doughboys" in front of countless armories and on town squares across America (fig. 13).These don't represent particular individuals, but symbolize the entire American Expeditionary Force and its heroism "over there." After World War II, on the other hand, it was the proponents of "The Living Memorial"?the useful and functioning addition to the fabric of civic life? who won out, leading to the construction across America of war memorial auditoriums, libraries, and recreational facilities in the 1950s. 173</page><page sequence="20">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW Fig. 14 War Memorial Swimming Pool, Amherst, Massachusetts. Photograph: Donna Roy. As someone who learned to swim in the Amherst, Massachusetts, "War Memorial Swimming Pool" in the 1960s, I found Shanken's article and the debates it enumerates particularly poignant (fig. 14). As a kid I knew this was the "War Memorial Pool" but had no idea what war was being referred to, whether the French and Indian, the Revolutionary, the locally fomented Shay's Rebellion, or something more recent, such as the Korean or one of the World Wars. Or all of them combined? Or did it have something to do with the ongoing Vietnam War? Not overtly, certainly, since this war was not yet ripe for memorialization and had never even been declared by Congress, and thus could only be officially referred to as a "conflict." We all called it a war anyway, and I recall thinking, as that war defined much of my and my family's negative attitudes towards any celebrations of the American military, let alone overt displays of patriotism, that the pool was somehow suspect, that swimrning there amounted to some sort of statement of approval of what should rightly be critically confronted and protested. On hot summer days I swam in it anyway, but I suspect its naming?in addition to its punish ingly sun-scorched concrete deck?has something to do with my father's feeling (expressed to me recently, in a conversation unconnected to this essay) that "I never hked that pool."This was an era, and my rniheu certainly one, in which military service, even in the good cause ofWorld War II, was seen, in Joseph Heller's unforgettable phrase and novel, as a Catch-22, a self-per 174</page><page sequence="21">Peter Chametzky petuating cycle of cynicism, exploitation, and violence that any sane person would seek to avoid and therefore proves himself fit for service, unqualified for a section 8 dismissal. The catch-22 of the "Hving memorial" is that even if you don't agree with its message you might need to swim, or get a book out of the Hbrary.The patriotic value to which we are told all American sacrifices ultimately relate?the protection of freedom, freedom of expression, reHgion, movement?is traduced by our coerced participation in and assumed assent with the message of the memorial itself. In 1945, writing in Good Housekeeping magazine, the leading American urban historian and theorist of the day, Lewis Mumford, offered another form of dissent from the national trend towards living memorials, arguing they were iU equipped to fulfill a patriotic function. Mumford argued that memorials need to take us out of our everyday environment and activities (as Eisenman s certainly does) to give us the opportunity to reflect on what he saw as the memorial's true caning, to promote responsible, reflective American (and world) citizens: Plainly, such a practical result cannot be achieved by an auditorium or a swimming pool, perfunctorily named a memorial. These useful struc tures do not bind us to the dead; they do not stir the feelings and rouse the energies that will keep us from being content with such debilitated efforts at cooperation as would merely give us the illusion of "peace in our time." That higher function and that higher purpose belong to the sphere of art, and such art is essentially of a religious character.42 Mumford's invocation of the sacred recaUs the "Tribute in Light"?as weU as predicting former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani's contention that whatever is ultimately built at ground zero must be "soaring and very beautiful"?which would seem to suggest, again, the aesthetic of the Gothic cathedral. The more practicaUy involved Mayor Bloomberg, though, has asserted, "People that live in Battery Park City don't want to live in a memo rial, and we've got to be sympathetic to that."43 Here, as in the Berlin Holocaust memorial, the "solution" that is being developed is a compro mise, in this case involving a dizzying cast headed by Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg, but also featuring developer Larry Silverstein, who leased the rights to the Trade Center Towers six weeks before their destruction, and thus coUected the insurance money on them, with the famiHes of victims forming a chorus of often dissenting voices. The leading part in the overaU development of the sixteen-acre site went to Daniel Libeskind, whose Jewish Museum Berlin catapulted him to world reknown as a builder and not just theorist of programmaticaUy symbolic structures. Libeskind devel oped the site plan and the initial, rather literal, "strenuously symboHc" to the 175</page><page sequence="22">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW point of kitsch concept for an also commercially functioning 1776-foot-tall "Freedom Tower," the final, $2-billion design of which is the product of David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merril.44 Other "blue chip" archi tectural projects at the site include office buildings by Fumihiko Maki and Richard Rogers, a performing arts center by Frank Gehry, and transportation center by Santiago Calatrava. The towers' footprints will be reserved for a symbolic memorial designed by Michael Arad and Peter Walker, "Reflecting Absence," pools of water sunk into the ground. The site will also include a "living" "Freedom Museum," as well as other cultural and commercial attractions, such as The Drawing Center, formerly a Soho fixture: all in all a monumentally American combination and compromise between the hving and the symbolic memorial, between commerce and commemoration, reflection and recreation (fig. 15).
