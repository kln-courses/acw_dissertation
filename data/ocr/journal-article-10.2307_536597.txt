Another for lagniappe: Patsy had buried two husbands. The rumor got out that she had a white liver and would kill every man that she married. She and Sol fell in love, and were sore troubled. Driver Green suggested that they call on Unc' Brutus, who lived on the Line. They took a roasted shoat for a present. The old man received them well, but he hedged, told them to return home and for each to look for a sign on the way. He said not to be afraid of hants, as he had his duppy pen them up; just to walk slowly and look for signs. If good they could be married without fear; if bad, then they must bow their heads and humble themselves. They had reached the big road that led to the draining machine, and had turned into the one to the quarters, when Patsy grabbed Sol's arm. "'Tain' no use," she sobbed. "Lissen that dawg th'owin' death howls." "Them ain', sugar. Ah chained up ma ole Ring. He smell me comin' back. Ah takes hit fer ma sign." A little later they came upon a mocking bird upon the ridge pole of a hay barn, pouring full-throated melody into the moonlight, throwing himself into the air and floating upon poised wings, dropping back to his perch. "That's ma sign, Sol, an' Ah takes hit. Efn the Lawd wuz prankin' wid me He won' do hit wid no mawkin' bird." "The Lawd? 'Lowed we wuz lookin' fer juju signs." "Ah axed 'em bofe."

HEWITT LEONARD BALLOWE Diamond, Louisiana Mu-Igala or the Way of Muu. A Medicine Song from the Cuna Indians of Panama. Translation and Comments by Nils M. Holmer and Henry Wassen. (G6teborg: Elanders Boktryckeri Aktiebolag, I947. Pp. 94. 4 figs. Kr. 4.) This text was acquired by Wassen, of the Etnografiska Museet in Goteborg, from a literate San Bias Cuna Indian, Guillermo Haya. The latter wrote it down in Cuna at the dictation of a medicine man, then added a rough translation in Spanish. Both were then given to Wassen. It is presented first as a Cuna text in 535 numbered lines, with orthography, syl- labication and word units regularized in accordance with a system set forth by Holmer in a separate chapter. Each line is a complete utterance as it would be chanted by a medicine man. The whole is then given in English translation (Holmer) in a like series of numbered lines, with elaborate footnotes to assist the reader over the inevitable dif- ficulties encountered in rendering a text between languages as different as are Cuna Reviews 445</page><page sequence="2">Journal of American Folklore and English in grammatical and semantic processes. Finally, the reader is provided with a synopsis and commentary (Wassen) which helps greatly to understand the main threads of the text. As for the song itself, it is a Cuna chant used for difficult childbirths and as such is an important document, for this is the first example known to be recorded from this tribe. Mu is, in Cuna belief, a female power or spirit concerned with the formation of the fetus and endowing it with all its functions. The song chronicles the birth proc- ess and contains, in essence, the medicine man's preparations, his instructions to spirit helpers that dwell in anthropomorphic wooden figures, their encounter with Mu in the underworld and their besting of her in word-fights and with cacao-bean smoke, the birth itself, and a follow-up treatment with plant medicines. All is cloaked in euphemistic and symbolic language in which the colorful conceptions and imagery of the Cuna are very evident, though not always too clearly explained by the authors. Wassen provides a number of detailed comparisons with similar concepts among other South American tribes and in four concluding pages suggests North American and possible Asiatic parallels. The whole is much more adequately presented than earlier medicine songs from the Cuna as published by Nordenskiild and Wassen.' The linguists may justifiably ask for accent marks in the native text as given by Holmer; the ethnologist concerned with Central and South America will find this an important, useful document. There are a number of typographical errors, probably unavoidable when type- setting and proofreading are done by printers to whom English is a foreign language. Few of them, however, destroy the meaning. D. B. STOUT Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York Gods &amp; Heroes. Myths &amp; Epics of Ancient Greece. By Gustav Schwab. Translated by Olga Marx and Ernst Morwitz; Introduction by Werner Jaeger. (New York: Pantheon Books Inc., I946. Pp. 764. Illustrated; index. $6.oo.) An English translation of Gustav Schwab's-to use the poet-critic's own title and spelling-Die schonsten Sagen des classischen Alterthums, which first appeared in I838, has been long needed. Pantheon's opus supplies that need and supplies it very well. Schwab's classic-for such it is-is tremendous in scope and difficult to describe. Its first half is given over to a retelling, rather than an exact translation, of the Greek myths and legends. The second half retells the two Homeric epics and a few related stories, in particular those of Agamemnon and his family. In other words, here is in digest all the traditional narrative material that formed the subject matter of an- cient Greek literature. More than any one other book, Gods &amp; Heroes demonstrates the great debt of all literatures to Greek legend and myth. Reading it will give any- one-except the classicist-a new light on the poetry, drama, and figurative refer- ences of his own and other literatures. It's a big book-and one that should be useful and enjoyable to everyone who pretends to culture without a truly intimate acquaint- ance with all the Greek classics. The translation, as the original, is in a language in- telligible to the mature high school student but by no means beneath the dignity of the highly educated adult. Schwab's work, as I have said, is not a translation. It is rather a summary and a 1 Cf. E.
