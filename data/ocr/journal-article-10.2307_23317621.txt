SLUSS Georgia Institute of Technology ROBERT E. PLOYHART University of South Carolina M. GLENN COBB U.S. Army Research Institute BLAKE E. ASHFORTH Arizona State University A recent theoretical proposal is that relational identification generalizes to organiza tional identification through affective, cognitive, and behavioral mediating mecha nisms. The generalization process is strengthened when a relational other is prototyp ical—that is, is seen as promoting core organizational values. We investigate these propositions via two field studies. First, we find, via temporally lagged data from 186 newcomers to the telemarketing industry, that relational identification with a super visor generalizes to organizational identification through affective (i.e., affect transfer), cognitive (i.e., social influence), and behavioral (i.e., behavioral "sensemaking") me diating mechanisms. Second, we find, via temporally lagged data from 1,101 newcom ers to the U.S. Army, that a newcomer's relational identification with his/her super visor generalizes to the newcomer's organizational identification, but only when the supervisor is perceived to be prototypical. Our combined findings suggest that (1) multiple identifications are more integrative than exclusive and (2) organizational membership may be more personalized and relational than previously assumed in extant research. Theory and research on newcomer socialization describe how a newcomer "becomes" an adjusted, integrated, and accepted member of a new organi zation (Ashforth, Sluss, &amp; Harrison, 2007a; Bauer, Bodner, Erdogan, Truxillo, &amp; Tucker, 2007; Van Maanen &amp; Schein, 1979). Inherent in the process of becoming is the process of identification (Ashforth The authors thank Associate Editor Michael Pratt and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive com ments.

Editor's note: The manuscript for this article was ac cepted for publication during the term of AMfs former editor-in-chief, R. Duane Ireland. &amp; Mael, 1989). In short, newcomers must answer a quintessential (and, at times, existential) question: "Who am I (now)?" Newcomers, therefore, strive to define themselves within their new organizational settings to facilitate adjustment (Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989; Pratt, 1998). According to recent advancements in social iden tity theory, common referents for this process of self-definition include (1) a newcomer's employing organization (organizational identification) and (2) the newcomer's immediate supervisor (relational identification [Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007, 2008]). Or ganizational identification has drawn the bulk of scholarly attention, which has only recently fo cused on relational identification (Brickson, 2000; Flynn, 2005; Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007, 2008). Re search, as a result, has clearly shown that organi zational identification impacts a wide range of pos itive attitudes and behaviors (e.g., less absenteeism, less turnover, more proactive learning, more satis faction, more organizationally beneficial behaviors [Ashforth, Harrison, &amp; Corley, 2008; Pratt, 1998, 949 Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

In an effort to predict organizational identification, scholarly work has focused on (1) organizational practices that increase identification both during and after socialization, such as collective and formalized ori entation programs (Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996; Ash forth, Sluss, &amp; Saks, 2007b; Atzori, Lombardi, Frac caroli, Battistelli, &amp; Zaniboni, 2008; Bullis &amp; Bach, 1989) and (2) organizational properties such as per ceived prestige and attractiveness (Bartels, Pruyn, de Jong, &amp; Joustra, 2007; Dukerich, Golden, &amp; Shor tell, 2002; Mael &amp; Ashforth, 1992; Riketta, 2005). Although organizational practices and properties provide insight into the process of identification, research has largely overlooked the influence of relational context—especially relational identifica tion with a supervisor (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007). Research has demonstrated that his/her supervi sory relationship serves a formative and facilitative function in a newcomer's organizational experi ence (Bauer &amp; Green, 1994; Gersick, Bartunek, &amp; Dutton, 2000; Kammeyer-Mueller &amp; Wanberg, 2003; Major, Kozlowski, Chao, &amp; Gardner, 1995). However, surprisingly little is known about how and under what conditions identification with his/ her supervisory relationship influences a newcom er's organizational identification (cf. Pratt, 2000; Sias, 2009). In two separate studies, we investigate the dynamics through which newcomers' relational identification generalizes (or spills over) to the newcomers' organizational identification. First, we investigate the affective, cognitive, and behavioral mechanisms (i.e., how) by which relational identi fication generalizes to, organizational identifica tion. Second, in a separate study, we investigate how a newcomer's supervisor's prototypicality be comes a key moderator (i.e., condition) in general izing relational identification to organizational identification. Taken together, these two studies contribute significantly to understanding of how newcomers define themselves in their organiza tional contexts as well as demonstrating that mul tiple identifications may be more cooperative than competitive. Investigating how and under what conditions re lational identification generalizes to organizational identification is important for three major reasons. First, our studies advance theory on multiple iden tifications in organizational settings by modeling a more parsimonious and holistic process than cur rent research supposes. Social identity theory indi cates that individuals interact with others of the same or different groups on the basis of a deperson alized understanding of these relational others when the social identity of groups is salient (Hogg, 2006; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986). For example, social identity theory would predict that a newcomer will base interaction with his/her supervisor upon a somewhat faceless (i.e., depersonalized) under standing of the supervisor rather than a nuanced picture of him/her as an individual (cf. Hogg, Mar tin, Epitropaki, Mankad, Svensson, &amp; Weeden, 2005; Hogg &amp; Terry, 2000). Similarly, social iden tity theory would predict that a newcomer is not likely to transfer personalized and/or idiosyncratic supervisory attributes to the newcomer's general understanding of an organization. In short, social identity theory, as well as recent advances in re search on levels of self (Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996; Cooper &amp; Thatcher, 2010), does not entertain the possibility for identification with a personalized relationship to influence or "talk to" identification with a more depersonalized collective. As a result, most research on multiple identifications has fo cused on comparing the strength of identification across various referents, often with the apparent assumption that increasing identification with one referent is associated with a decrease in identifica tion with another (e.g., Johnson, Morgeson, Ilgen, Meyer, &amp; Lloyd, 2006; Riketta &amp; van Dick, 2005; cf. Hekman, Bigley, Steensma, &amp; Hereford, 2009; Hek man, Steensma, Bigley, &amp; Hereford, 2009). Testing the generalization process of relational and organ izational identifications will provide essential evi dence on the processes by and conditions under which personalization informs (and possibly mutes) depersonalization. In addition, our studies may help show that multiple identifications can cooperate with each other rather than conflict and compete. Second, the influence of a newcomer's supervi sor on his/her identification, and therefore adjust ment, may be the dark horse of the socialization process (cf. Kammeyer-Mueller &amp; Wanberg, 2003). Scholars can "ill afford to ignore the role of the supervising manager during the adjustment pro cess" (Bauer &amp; Green, 1998: 82). Indeed, research ers know that, via mentoring and other supportive behaviors, high-quality supervisory relationships influence job satisfaction and task accommodation during newcomer adjustment (Bauer &amp; Green, 1994,1998; Green &amp; Bauer, 1995). Nevertheless, the bulk of research on socialization and social identi fication in organizations relies heavily on organiza tion-wide structures, processes, or variables (e.g., orientation programs, on-the-job training, organiza tional prestige) as the main mechanisms for theo retically explaining and empirically predicting newcomer attachment. As a result, research has largely overlooked the sway that a newcomer's im mediate supervisor has on the newcomer's nascent identification with a new organization. In addition,</page><page sequence="3">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth 951 the supervisor's sway may only hold under certain conditions. Supervisors are traditionally assumed to (1) embody or personify the organization for subordinates (e.g., Ashforth &amp; Rogers, in press; Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986; Eisenberger et al., 2010), (2) create idiosyncratic relationships with subordinates (e.g., Graen &amp; Uhl Bien, 1995; Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007), and (3) posi tively portray their organization's goals, values, and norms as well as the attached roles (e.g., Cash man, Dansereau, Graen, &amp; Haga, 1976; cf. Stryker &amp; Burke, 2000). Though employing the first two as sumptions, we challenge the third. Our second study relaxes the assumption that supervisors are always exemplary—that is, prototypical—and a "natural source for teaching appropriate organiza tional values to subordinates" (Lord &amp; Brown, 2001: 148) as well as always "talking up" their organization (e.g., Jackall, 1988). Third, an assumption in the social identity model of leadership (e.g., Hogg, 2001; van Knip penberg &amp; Hogg, 2003) is that leaders are more likely to be endorsed and seen as effective j/they are prototypical of the group they lead (e.g., Giess ner &amp; van Knippenberg, 2008; Hirst, van Dick, &amp; van Knippenberg, 2009; van Dijke &amp; De Cremer, 2008; van Knippenberg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2005). However, theory states that these mechanisms only work when followers or subordinates identify strongly with the collective —an assumption that is not always satisfied. We contend that newcomers are in the process of identifying (or not) with their organization (Ashforth et al., 2008), and supervi sors' prototypicality may "make or break" this nas cent organizational identification (cf. Giessner &amp; van Knippenberg, 2008; Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008; van Knippenberg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2005). Thus, we extend the social identity model of leadership by applying it to the newcomer context in which prototypicality plays an important role as the con dition under which identification takes place— namely, how a new organization member moves from identifying with a personalized supervisory relationship to identifying with the more or less depersonalized organization. THEORY AND HYPOTHESES Building upon work in social psychology (e.g., Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996), Sluss and Ashforth (2007, 2008) proposed that relational identification may generalize to organizational identification. More specifically, given that identification involves the "whole person" via affect, cognition, and behavior, it is proposed to converge across referents (in our case, supervisory relationship and organization) via affective, cognitive, and behavioral mediating mechanisms. Generalizing relational to organiza tional identification also is somewhat condition al—especially when the relational other (in our case, a newcomer's supervisor) is perceived as pro totypical or, in other words, "a typical and exem plary representative of the collective" (Sluss &amp; Ash forth, 2008: 816; Bullis &amp; Bach, 1989). Although prototypicality has been operationalized or experi mentally manipulated via a wide range of variables (e.g., demographic characteristics, personality traits, past work experience), we focus on behaviors that promote core organizational values (cf. van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003). In this section, we review the conceptualization and mechanisms of relational and organizational identification. Next, we build on basic generalization principles from applied psychology to hypothesize how identifica tion generalization occurs via affect transfer, social influence, and behavioral "sensemaking"—that is, via affective, cognitive, and behavioral mecha nisms. Then, after reporting the results of Study 1, we test the hypothesis in Study 2 that a supervi sor's prototypicality moderates the generalization process between relational identification and organ izational identification. For an overview of our model, please see Figure 1. Relational and Organizational Identification Organizational scholars argue that supervisory relationships (as well as other salient role relation ships) are essential to how individuals define themselves at work (Brickson, 2000; Cooper &amp; Thatcher, 2010; Flynn, 2005; Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007; also see work in social psychology [e.g., Aron &amp; Aron, 2000; Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996]). In short, a newcomer's immediate supervisor is an important "looking glass" into the newcomer's organization (Ashforth et al., 2007a; cf. Mead, 1934; Stryker &amp; Burke, 2000). The newcomer's relationship with his/or supervisor—the supervisory relationship— becomes, as such, a high-value target or referent for relational identification—that is, "the (partial) def inition of oneself in terms of a given relationship" (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007: 15). A newcomer is likely to include his/her supervisory relationship in his/ her self-concept to the extent that it positively ful fills both task and psychosocial needs (cf. Aron &amp; Aron, 2000). The attractiveness of the supervisory relationship to the newcomer is therefore likely influenced by the perceived valence of the super visor's role vis-a-vis the newcomer (e.g., assigning tasks, providing feedback) and by the manner in which the supervisor enacts the role (e.g., courte ously, fairly, competently). The attractiveness of</page><page sequence="4">Academy of Management Journal FIGURE 1 Identification Convergence: Mediation and Moderation the supervisory relationship and the subsequent relational identification provides salutary benefits such as self-enhancement (cf. Dutton, Dukerich, &amp; Harquail, 1994), a sense of connection and belong ing (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995), self-expansion (Aron &amp; Aron, 2000), and self-consistency (see also Cooper &amp; Thatcher, 2010; Swann, 1987). As a re sult, relational identification likely promotes posi tive attitudes and behaviors targeted at the relation ship such as empathy, liking, cooperation, and helping. In addition, relational identification may spawn positive attitudes and behaviors toward other referents that are connected with the relation ship (as indicated by, for example, organizational citizenship behaviors, job satisfaction, and inten tions to stay). Effectively, the newcomer experi ences the connected referents "as an extension of the role-relationship" (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007: 18)—with one key referent being the organization. A critical determinant of newcomer adjustment is organizational identification, generally defined as "the perception of oneness with or belonging ness to" the organization wherein the organization becomes a part, at least at work, of who the person is—(i.e., self-defining) (Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989: 21; Patchen, 1970). Organizational identification is of ten confused with organizational commitment. Or ganizational commitment refers to a person's posi tive attitude toward his/her organization, wherein the person's sense of self and organization remain separate entities; conversely, organizational identi fication refers to the intertwining of self with what defines one's organization (Ashforth et al., 2008; Pratt, 1998). As a result, organization commitment can be more readily transferred to other organiza tions that promote similarly positive attitudes, whereas organizational identification is necessarily organization-specific, so that leaving a particular organization prompts a visceral sense of personal loss (Ashforth, 2001). Pratt (1998) argued that iden tification occurs via either affinity, in which a per son recognizes similarities between self and organ ization, or emulation, in which the person changes to become more similar to the organization. Orga nizational identification has been argued to address numerous psychological motives, particularly for</page><page sequence="5">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth 953 self-enhancement, belonging, and uncertainty re duction (e.g., Hogg &amp; Terry, 2000; Pratt, 1998). Generalizing Relational Identification to Organizational Identification Following Sluss and Ashforth (2008), we argue that relational identification may spill over to or ganizational identification via the principle of gen eralization from applied psychology. Specifically, generalization occurs when attitudes toward two similar referents tend to mutually spill over (e.g., Till &amp; Priluck, 2000). "Generalization between two referents relies on them resembling each other. Re semblance does not necessarily mean that the two stimuli look, feel, or are the same. Instead, resem blance refers to the two stimuli being tied or primed together" (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008: 811). Importantly, this means that, for generalization of identifications to occur, our two referents—a newcomer's supervisory relationship and employ ing organization—need only to be tied together in some psychologically meaningful way. Newcomers rely heavily on others for information about what the organization is, how it operates, and where they fit in (Chao, 1997; Morrison, 1993). The supervisor is generally perceived as a credible and appropriate "agent" of the organization (e.g., Eisenberger et al„ 1986); indeed, as noted, the supervisor may even personify the organization for newcomers (e.g., Ashforth &amp; Rogers, in press; Eisenberger et al., 2010). Further, the supervisory relationship is likely to be psychologically connected to the organ ization given that the organization serves as the "home" for the relationship and the supervisory relationship's goals support the goals of the organ ization (Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978). For example, the su pervisory relationship holds the keys to project allocation, reward distribution, and job training (e.g., Chen, Tsui, &amp; Farh, 2002). In addition, the organization (especially for the newcomer) is still somewhat abstract, consisting mainly of general impressions (Ashforth &amp; Johnson, 2001). The su pervisor—a psychologically connected agent of the organization—should serve then as a type of win dow into the organization's more localized context. Given these perceived links between the supervi sory relationship and the organization, identifica tion with the former may therefore generalize to identification with the latter. Thus: Hypothesis 1. A newcomer's relational iden tification with his or her supervisor is posi tively related to the newcomer's organiza tional identification. Generalizing Relational to Organizational Identification: Mediating Mechanisms How, specifically, does relational identification generalize to organizational identification? Har quail (1998) noted that identification involves the "whole person"—affect, cognition, and behavior. Ashforth's (2001) "ABC" (affect/behavior/cogni tion) model of identification further indicates that one can "feel," "act," or "think" one's way into identification (2001: 209-215). This tripartite for mulation is consistent with Sluss and Ashforth's (2008) argument that identification generalizes across referents through affective, behavioral, and cognitive mediators: (l) affect transfer (affect), (2) social influence (cognition), and (3) behavioral sense making (behavior). Sluss and Ashforth proposed an additional cognitive mechanism, anthropomor phization (i.e., "ascribing relational qualities to the collective" [2008: 813]). Although affect transfer, social influence, and behavioral sensemaking can occur within a nascent supervisory relationship, anthropormorphization implies a more established relationship. Because this assumption is question able for newcomers (the focus of our studies), we have not included anthropomorphization. In Study 1, we assume that supervisory relationship and or ganization are more or less equally interconnected for all newcomer-supervisor relationships. We re lax this assumption in Study 2 and test how a supervisor's prototypicality (i.e., being an exemplar of the organization through promoting its values) moderates the association between relational and organizational identification. Affective mediator: Affect transfer. Affect is an important underlying construct within newcomer adjustment (Ashforth &amp; Saks, 2002; see also Brief, 1998; Louis, 1980). A newcomer experiences both the affective ups and downs of learning about and adjusting to a new organization as well as his or her place in it. Similarly, the process of identification entails a strong affective component wherein the magnitude of identification with a target is tied fairly strongly to how one feels about that target (see Ashforth et al.'s [2008] review). Extending findings from marketing (Kim, Allen, &amp; Kardes, 1996) and personal relationships (Bance, 1999), Sluss and Ashforth proposed that the "affect generated from identifying with a role relationship may directly and unconsciously transfer to the or ganization and vice versa" (2008: 814). In other words, a newcomer's identification with his/her supervisory relationship naturally increases the positive affect felt toward the supervisory relation ship (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007). And given that the supervisory relationship and the organization are</page><page sequence="6">954 Academy of Management Journal August "primed" together for the newcomer, relational identification should simultaneously increase pos itive affect felt toward the organization—hence, the somewhat unconscious transfer of affect from the relationship to the organization. The positive affect felt toward the organization then provides a posi tive entrée to identifying with the organization (Harquail, 1998; Harris &amp; Cameron, 2005). In sum, the newcomer's relational identification with the supervisor, via affect transfer, increases positive affect felt toward the organization which, in turn, increases the newcomer's propensity to identify with the organization. Hence: Hypothesis 2. Affect transfer partially medi ates the relationship between a newcomer's relational identification with his or her su pervisor and the newcomer's organizational identification. Cognitive mediator: Social influence. The no tion that individuals' opinions are susceptible to and influenced by others' opinions pervades soci ological, psychological, and organizational theo ries. Indeed, Mead (1934) argued, in his theory of symbolic interactionism, that important relational others deeply influence a focal individual's self concept. Similarly, social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) and social information process ing theory (Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978) propose that others' opinions sway how individuals form their own opinions—particularly in new situations or contexts. Following these theoretical threads, we argue that a newcomer's relational identification with his/her supervisor will open a conduit for the su pervisor to socially influence the newcomer's opin ions about the organization, and, as a result, the newcomer's self-concept (and what is included therein). Relational identification "tends to in crease the value of the norms, opinions, goals, and information stemming from the [newcomer—su pervisor] relationship" (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008: 812). Beyer and Hannah (2002) found that, even for engineers with industry experience, supervisors are "centrally located" as organizational represen tatives and become a key source for opinions about the engineers' new organizations. In addition, a newcomer's supervisor is generally expected to cast their organization in a positive light (Jackall, 1988), which should increase its perceived attractive ness and provide a cognitive anchor within the new comer's self-concept. Taking these arguments to gether, we expect that a newcomer's identification with the supervisory relationship will tend to in crease the intensity with which the newcomer pays attention to the supervisor's opinions about their or ganization (i.e., social influence) and, assuming that the supervisor positively portrays the organization, this social influence will tend to increase organiza tional identification. Thus: Hypothesis 3. Social influence (from a new comer's supervisor) partially mediates the re lationship between the newcomer's relational identification with the supervisor and the new comer's organizational identification. Behavioral mediator: Behavioral sensemaking. To this point, we have focused on how newcomers "feel" (i.e., via affect transfer) or "think" (i.e., via social influence) their way from relational identifi cation to organizational identification. We now fo cus on how newcomers "behave" their way to or ganizational identification. A basic tenet of arguments concerning social identification processes is that individuals who identify with a target will behave in ways that benefit that target (cf. Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986). As noted, abundant empirical evidence demonstrates that organizational identification tends to be posi tively correlated with organizationally beneficial behaviors (e.g., extra-role performance, cooperation (Riketta, 2005; Riketta &amp; van Dick, 2005). Similarly, relational identification is argued to engender be haviors that benefit the targeted role relationship— such as interpersonal helping, relational rule fol lowing, and the like (cf. Blader &amp; Tyler, 2009; Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007). That said, the relationship be tween identification and behavior "is complex and probably reciprocal" (Burke &amp; Reitzes, 1981: 83). We argue, as did Ashforth and colleagues, that "be haviors are very important for the self- and social construction of identification such that one may not only think and feel one's way into identi fication but one may act one's way into it as well" (2008: 331). In other words, the more individuals behave like a bona fide organization members, the more likely these individuals will form self-defin ing beliefs regarding their behavior. "Behavioral sensemaking" ("in this case, attrib uting behavior engendered from one identification target to another" [Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008: 815]) may be one particular way that newcomers experi ence and "act their way" to organizational identifi cation. Behavioral sensemaking is centered on the fact that many behaviors in organizational settings are simultaneously "aligned across" multiple tar gets of identification—especially targets that are nested. Behaviors, for example, due to identifica tion with the supervisor relationship (e.g., consci entiously completing a customer work order to ful fill the supervisor's expectations) may look quite similar to behaviors due to organizational identifi</page><page sequence="7">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth 955 cation (e.g., conscientiously completing a customer work order to increase organizational productivity and quicken the sales process). In many respects, the behavioral goals emanating from the newcom er-supervisor relationship have a large overlap with behavioral goals set by the organization. For exam ple, both supervisor and organization would expect the newcomer to exert effort in learning how to perform key tasks (Bauer et al., 2007). Enacting behaviors that are thus aligned across multiple targets of identification tends to trigger a sensemaking process in which the need for self consistency becomes predominant (Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, 1997, 2001; cf. Weick, 1995). In our case, the new comer who identifies with the supervisory relation ship and enacts a behavior that fulfills both the supervisor's and organization's expectations will infer that he or she also must identify with the organization—because of the newcomer's need for self-consistency (Swann, 1987). To explain, indi viduals desire consistency between who they are (i.e., identification) and what they do (i.e., behav ioral enactment) (Kessler &amp; Wiener, 1972; Swann, 1987; cf. Swann, Griffin, Predmore, &amp; Gaines, 1987). Thus, a newcomer who identifies strongly with the supervisory relationship will tend to be have in a way that is aligned with the goals of the supervisory relationship. Given that the supervi sor-targeted behavior likely also supports the goals of the organization, the newcomer, desiring to maintain self-consistency, will tend to then infer organizational identification from his or her behav ior. Hence: Hypothesis 4. Behavioral sensemaking par tially mediates the relationship between a new comer's relational identification with his/her supervisor and the newcomer's organizational i d en tifi cation. STUDY 1: METHODS Sample The sample consists of 186 newcomers in 12 telemarketing organizations from the U.S. We ad ministered three temporally lagged surveys to the newcomers as part of a larger data collection effort on the newcomer experience. None of the substan tive variables overlapped across studies. Of the ini tial 819 surveys sent, 481 (59%) participants re turned a completed first survey. Of these, 296 (61%) participants returned a completed second survey, and 186 (63%) then returned the final sur vey. The final sample of 186 respondents (23%) can be described as follows: female, 56 percent; Cauca sian, 42 percent; mean age, 29 years (s.d. = 11); full-time, 59 percent; probationary, 65 percent; and working at an in-bound call center, 53 percent. The sample description is quite similar to the demo graphic characteristics of call center employees in the U.S. (Morrell, 2008). Participating Organizations The telemarketing industry is large and diverse in services and products yet similar in human re source issues such as new hire training, perfor mance, and retention. Access to these organizations was facilitated via two professional industry asso ciations. An e-mail invitation was sent to each or ganization's CEO. In response, 12 organizations volunteered to participate. The new employees in these 12 organizations worked exclusively on the telephones in call centers. Although the typical telemarketer's tasks are often repetitive, routinized, and without high coworker interdependence (e.g., Taylor &amp; Bain, 1999); Wegge, van Dick, Fisher, Wecking, and Moltzen (2006), the occupation is nonetheless very demanding at times; demands in clude dealing with annoyed clients, processing of ten complex information in real time, transitioning instantly to new calls, and more. In all 12 organi zations, the newcomers were sequestered during formal training (for an average of five days) from the rest of their organization and did not perform hands-on tasks. After the training, they began work ing under an assigned supervisor. The newcomers' core task was to "be productive," whether that was to register someone for an appointment with a pre view weekend stay at an exclusive resort, obtain a donation for a fundraiser, solve a customer prob lem, or sell an actual product. Production was mea sured on daily, weekly, and monthly cycles. As such, the newcomers focused on these report cycles in adjusting to and learning about the job and or ganization. Additionally, the newcomers, after completing training, interacted daily with their im mediate supervisors for direction and feedback. Procedure The identification process unfolds over time, and consequently, we designed our study to ensure that measures of identification and the hypothesized mediators were assessed at theoretically appropri ate intervals. Surveys were administered at three points in time to provide the most rigorous test of the hypotheses (Mitchell &amp; James, 2001): (1) two weeks following formal training (time 1 [Tl]); (2) five weeks following formal training (time 2 [T2]); and (3) eight weeks following formal training (time 3 [T3]). The Tl survey included measures of</page><page sequence="8">956 Academy of Management Journal August relational identification and demographic variables as well as a baseline measure of organizational identification so as to best specify the predictive power of relational identification during newcomer adjustment. The demographic information in cluded age, gender, race/ethnicity, previous work experience, permanent versus probationary status, full-time versus part-time status, and out-bound versus in-bound call center status. The T2 survey included measures of the mediating mechanisms (i.e., affect transfer, social influence, and behav ioral sensemaking). The T3 survey included the dependent variable, organizational identification. The timing was purposeful. First, two weeks after training allowed newcomers to provide an initial attitudinal measurement (for both their organiza tion-newcomer and supervisor-newcomer relation ship). Second, measuring organizational identifica tion eight weeks after the end of training was appropriate considering the training and task cy cles in the telemarketing industry (Morrison, 2002; Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1997). We included several safeguards in our design to reduce concerns about common method bias (Pod sakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003). First, we separated the measurement of the independent, mediating, and dependent variables by a temporal lag, which reduces biases (e.g., consistency motifs, illusionary correlations) that might occur in a cross-sectional study. Second, we grouped items in the surveys and separated the variables to increase psychological distance (in the same survey). Third, we promoted participant confidentiality. Partici pants were assured that the completed surveys were not handled or seen by any of the newcomers' direct supervisors at any time. Attrition Analysis Analyses were conducted to determine if attri tion (i.e., owing either to not responding to later surveys or termination of employment) resulted in a final sample that differed from the overall sample (i.e., nonrandom sampling bias [Goodman &amp; Blum, 1996; Lance, Vandenberg, &amp; Self, 2000]). Goodman and Blum (1996) suggested using individual differ ence variables to test for inherent differences be tween respondent groups. We compared the final sample (i.e., those that responded at times 1, 2, and 3) to two groups: (1) those that only responded at time 1 and (2) those that only responded at both times 1 and 2. We compared demographic variables and the baseline measure of organizational identi fication for these groups and found no differences. Although we have no data with which to compare the final sample's demographic profile with each participating organization's demographic profile, the final sample is similar to the general population of U.S. telemarketers (Morrell, 2008), which helps reduce concerns with nonresponse bias. Measures Organizational identification. Organizational identification was measured via three items from the measure by Mael and Ashforth (1992): (1) "When I talk about this organization, I usually say 'we' rather than 'they,'" (2) "This organization's successes are my successes," and (3) "When some one praises this organization it feels like a personal compliment." We obtained an alpha reliability of .88. Given the negative external image of the tele marketing industry, the three other items from Mael and Ashforth were not relevant due to their reliance on external social comparisons. Scale development: Content and construct va lidity. Scales for relational identification, affect transfer, social influence, and behavioral sense making were developed for this study. We devel oped initial items on the basis of theory for each of these constructs (Hinkin, 1998). After initial item generation, two subject matter experts (doctoral level research associates in organizational behav ior) reviewed the items for (1) alignment with the theoretical definitions and (2) clarity. The items were revised and submitted to five additional sub ject matter experts who then matched these revised items with one of the theoretical (i.e., operational) definitions. This matching process generates both a substantive agreement index and substantive valid ity coefficient (Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1991). We de leted or adapted items using these indexes. Last, a third group of five (additional) subject matter ex perts conducted a second round of the matching process to ensure proper alignment of the new and adapted items with the operational definitions. The content validation process produced a total of 28 items for the four scales. We then tested for construct validity via a pilot study with 158 nonnewcomer telemarketing em ployees from one of the sample organizations. These individuals completed a survey that in cluded the 28 generated items and the 3 items for organizational identification to assure that the es tablished organizational identification measure was appropriate for the telemarketing sample. We tested a five-factor model using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) via AMOS 18. As typ ical in scale development, 12 of the 28 generated items were deleted because of low reliabilities, low loadings, and/or high cross-loadings, a process leaving 16 items. The resulting trimmed model</page><page sequence="9">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth demonstrated good to excellent fit (*2 = 98.33 [df = 80]; p = .08; *2/d/ &lt; 2]; RMSEA = .04 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05; p = .78]; NNFI = .98; CFI = .99; all alpha reliabilities &gt; .70; factor loadings &gt; .50). RMSEA, NNFI, and CFI have been found to be less sensitive to sample size and, thus, are useful fit indexes when analyzing models based on smaller samples (i.e., n 200 [Fan, Thompson, &amp; Wang, 1999]). Relational identification. Relational identifica tion, affect transfer, social influence, and behav ioral sensemaking used a scale ranging from 1, "strongly disagree," to 7, "strongly agree." Rela tional identification (a = .85) consisted of four items:1 (1) "My relationship with my immediate supervisor is an important part of who I am at work," (2) "If someone criticized my relationship with my immediate supervisor, it would feel like a personal insult," (3) "My relationship with my im mediate supervisor is vital to the kind of person I am at work," and (4) "My relationship with my immediate supervisor is important to my self-image at work." Measures for mediating mechanisms. Affect transfer focused on positive felt affect toward a newcomer's organization (e.g., "I am fond of my organization"; a = .92). Social influence focused on how much importance the newcomer gave to his/ her supervisor's opinions about the organization (e.g., "What my immediate supervisor thinks about the organization is very important to me"; a = .88). Behavioral sensemaking focused on behaviors that are aligned with both the supervisor's and the or ganization's expectations (e.g., "Making an extra effort to understand how my organization wants me to do my job"; a = .82). The Appendix presents all Study 1 items. Control measures. To better estimate change in organizational identification, we controlled for the baseline level of organizational identification at Tl. As such, we were able to control for each individ ual's response tendency and more rigorously cap ture relational identification's impact on organiza tional identification at T3. We also captured a series of demographic variables that may influence an individual's proclivity to identify with his/her organization (Bauer et al., 2007). Beyond race/eth nicity, gender, and age, we also measured three employment statuses: (1) full-time versus part time, (2) permanent versus probationary, and (3) in-bound call center employment versus out-bound call center employment. Full-time and permanent employees are presumably more invested in their company, and "in-bound employees" have more intrinsically motivating tasks, suggesting greater psychological involvement (Riketta, 2005). Given that the number of demographic control variables was relatively high, we wanted to avoid unnecessarily reducing statistical power. Follow ing Becker (2005), we conducted a regression anal ysis predicting organizational identification (at T3). The first step included our baseline measure of organizational identification and the second step included the demographic variables. After organi zational identification had been accounted for at Tl, none of the demographic variables significantly predicted organizational identification at T3. Thus, we included only organizational identification (at Tl) as a control variable in the analyses de scribed below. STUDY 1: RESULTS Descriptive statistics, reliabilities, and correla tions among variables are presented in Table 1. Support for our simplest proposition, that rela tional identification generalizes to organizational identification, is hinted at in Table 1. Notice that the correlation between relational identification (measured at Tl) and organizational identification (measured at T3) is stronger (r = .40) then when organizational identification is measured at Tl (r = .29). Even with the possible inflation of the Tl correlations, we still find a stronger relationship between relational identification and organiza tional identification when the latter is measured at T3. However, a more rigorous test of generalization is provided by our use of structural equation mod eling (AMOS 18) to test the mediation hypotheses. We were able to model (and therefore control for) measurement error as well as simultaneously test for the mediating or indirect effects. We also em ployed Sobel tests and bootstrapping analyses to confirm that the indirect (or mediating) effects were significant (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008). 1 Relational identification and leader-member ex change, albeit interrelated, are conceptually and empiri cally distinct. Leader-member exchange (e.g., Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995) concerns the perceived quality of the relationship between a subordinate and his or her man ager. In contrast, relational identification concerns the extent to which a subordinate defines him or herself in terms of his or her relationship with his/her manager (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007). In a study of 187 working professionals, Sluss, Cooper, Morrell, and Thompson (2008) found that leader-member exchange and relational identification were positively correlated (r = .48); never theless, the two constructs were empirically distinct per the results of confirmatory factor analysis.</page><page sequence="10">Academy of Management Journal TABLE 1 Study 1: Descriptive Statistics, Reliability Coefficients, and Correlations" Variableb Mean s.d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1.

Overall, the measurement model demonstrated excellent fit (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999; *2 = 104.94 [df= 94], p = .21; RMSEA = .03 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .97]; NNFI = .99; CFI = .99). That said, the mediating mechanisms were measured at the same time (T2) and, as such, may be more subject to common method bias than the other variables. We therefore tested three alternative measurement models. First, we tested a three-factor model in which relational identification and organizational identi fication remained separate factors while the medi ating mechanisms were combined into one factor. This model demonstrated unsatisfactory fit as well as poorer comparative fit than the hypothesized model {x2 = 608.66 [df = 101], p = .00]; RM SEA = .17 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .00]; NNFI = .69; CFI = .74). Second, given the moderately high cor relations among affect transfer, social influence, and organizational identification, we tested an other three-factor model in which relational iden tification and behavioral sensemaking remained separate factors while affect transfer, social influ ence, and organizational identification were com bined into one factor. This model also demon strated unsatisfactory fit and did not fit as well as the hypothesized model [y2 = 668.80 [df = 101] p = .00; RMSEA = .17 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .00]; NNFI = .65; CFI = .70). Finally, we tested a two factor model in which we combined relational identification and organizational identification in one "identification" factor and the mediating mechanisms into another. The model also demon strated unsatisfactory fit and did not fit as well as the hypothesized model (x2 = 853.45 [df = 103], p = .00; RMSEA = .20 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .00]; NNFI = .54; CFI = .61). Thus, we treated our five variables as discriminant in all subsequent analyses. Structural Model We tested the direct effect between relational identification and organizational identification as well as the indirect effects of affect transfer, social influence, and behavioral sensemaking while con trolling for the baseline measure of organizational identification. Figure 2 diagrams mediating mech anisms. We first specified a direct effect model in which relational identification predicted organiza tional identification with baseline organizational identification controlled for. The direct effect model demonstrated excellent fit with the data (X2 = 19.93 [df =33, p = .21]; RMSEA = .02 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .77]; NNFI = .99; CFI = .99). The direct effect was significant (/3 = .37, p &lt; .01) and, as such, supports Hypothesis 1, which states that newcomer identification with the supervisor relationship is positively related to newcomer or ganizational identification. Next, we specified a partial mediation model in which we added the indirect effects of affect trans fer, social influence, and behavioral sensemaking. The partial mediation model demonstrated excel lent fit [x2 = 192.07 [df = 111], p = .00; RM SEA = .06 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05; p = .08]; NNFI = .95; CFI = .96). We then compared the partial media tion model to a mediation model in which we spec</page><page sequence="11">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth FIGURE 2 Mediating Mechanisms for Identification Convergence3 V = 195.64 (df= 112, p = .00); RMSEA = .06 (H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .07); NNFI = .95; CFI = .96. * p &lt; .01 ** p &lt; .05 ified a null direct effect between relational identi fication and organizational identification. This full mediation model—wherein the effect of relational identification on organizational identification is specified through the indirect effects of affect trans fer, social influence, and behavioral sensemaking— also demonstrated excellent fit and was not signif icantly different from the partial mediation model (X2 = 195.64 [df= 112, p = .00]; RMSEA = .06 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .07]; NNFI = .95; CFI = .96; A*2 = 3.57 [df = 1, p &gt; .05]). As such and in support of Hypotheses 2 through 4, we report the path coefficients from the full mediation model, given its increased parsimony. Hypotheses 2,3, and 4 predict that affect transfer, social influence, and behavioral sensemaking each partially mediates the relationship between a new comer's relational identification and his or her or ganizational identification. For Hypothesis 2, the paths between relational identification and affect transfer (.40, p &lt; .01), as well as that between affect transfer and organizational identification (.35, p &lt; .01), were significant. To test whether the in direct effect was significantly different from zero, we employed two tests: (1) Sobel's test and (2) bias-corrected bootstrapping (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008). We found that the indirect effect of affect transfer, via Sobel's test, was statistically different from zero (t = 3.39, p &lt; .01). Although the param eters used from our structural model for Sobel's test took into account the covariation of the other me diators, Sobel's test has an assumption of multivar iate normality, which is frequently violated. Ac cordingly, we also generated, via bootstrapping analysis, a 95% "bias-corrected" confidence inter val for the specific indirect effect (Bollen &amp; Stine, 1992; MacKinnon, Lockwood, &amp; Williams, 2004; Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008; Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002). This confidence interval was .04 to .22, demon strating a statistically significant indirect effect for affect transfer. Taken together, these findings sup port Hypothesis 2 in that affect transfer mediated the association between a newcomer's relational identifi cation and subsequent organizational identification. For Hypothesis 3, the paths between relational identification and social influence (.52, p &lt; .01), as well as between social influence and organizational identification (.31 &gt; P &lt; .01), were significant. We found, via Sobel's test, the indirect effect to be statistically different from zero (f=3.36,jp&lt;.01), and the 95% confidence interval, via bootstrap ping, was .10-30. Thus, Hypothesis 3 was fully supported. Finally, for Hypothesis 4, the paths between rela tional identification and behavioral sensemaking (.34, p &lt; .01), as well as between behavioral sense making and organizational identification (.16, p &lt; .05), were significant. In addition, the indirect effect was significantly different from zero according to Sobel's test (f = 2.06, p &lt; .05), and the 95% con fidence interval from bootstrapping analyses was .01 to .12. Thus, our findings support Hypothesis 4. As a supplemental analysis, we also contrasted the specific indirect effects via a bootstrapping</page><page sequence="12">Academy of Management Journal analysis (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008). We found that none of the paired contrasts (i.e., affect transfer with social influence; affect transfer with behav ioral sensemaking; social influence with behavioral sensemaking) were significantly different from zero. As such, none of the indirect effects were significantly different from each other in magni tude and we concluded, at least from our data, that affect transfer, social influence, and behavioral sensemaking are somewhat equally yoked as medi ators of how identification generalizes across targets. STUDY 2: THE MODERATING ROLE OF PROTOTYPICALITY In the first study, we broached the question, How does relational identification generalize to organi zational identification? The overarching purpose was to theorize and then assess the processes by which relational identification spills over or leads to organizational identification. As we hypothe sized, we found that generalization occurs via af fective (i.e., affect transfer), cognitive (i.e., social influence), and behavioral (i.e., behavioral sense making) processes; indeed, all three mediators played fairly equal roles. Within these mediators and particularly within social influence, we as sumed that a supervisor's promulgated affect, be havior, and opinions would reflect positively upon an organization—creating a positive connection for a newcomer between relational and organizational identification. In the second study, we relaxed this assumption and assessed how the supervisor's pro totypicality might make or break the generalization of relational identification to organizational identification. As argued above, social identity theorists have recently posited generalization across relational identification and organizational identification. However, not all supervisory relationships and or ganizations are equally intertwined. Specifically, referents vary in how much they psychologically resemble each other. One major way a relational other might resemble a collective—in this case, an organization—is prototypicality. We argue that the prototypicality of a supervisor will moderate the generalization of relational identification to organ izational identification. Prototypicality is the ex tent to which, in our case, the supervisor "is per ceived to be a typical and exemplary representative of the collective" (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008: 816). As noted, prototypicality has been utilized and opera tionalized in various ways (van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003). One major stream of research is lead ership categorization theory, according to which individuals are categorized as "leaders" when their traits or behaviors match a perceiver's salient pro totype of a leader (Lord, Foti, &amp; DeVader, 1984). Although there is "substantial agreement" (Lord &amp; Hall, 2003: 51) in the elements of such prototypes (a typical leader is often thought to be, for example, dedicated, intelligent, and charismatic [Offerman, Kennedy, &amp; Wirtz, 1994]), prototypes vary by social domain (e.g., business vs. politics), hierarchical level, and gender, and they are shaped by the per ceiver's experience and remain somewhat idiosyn cratic and dynamic. Thus, both the perceiver and the context are implicated in attributions of leader ship to a given person. In our model, leaders were already formally defined by their organization (in this study, as drill sergeants), and we focused on the extent to which these leaders were prototypical in the sense that they extolled the organization's (in this case, the U.S. Army's) values to their followers. A second major stream of research is the social identity model of leadership (Hogg, 2001; van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003), mentioned earlier. Ac cording to this model, "The ingroup prototype de scribes and prescribes group membership appropri ate attributes in a specific context" (van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003: 245; see also Haslam, Reicher, &amp; Platow, 2011;). As such, prototypes em body a mix of the actual and the ideal. In the social identity model of leadership, prototypicality is a match between the attributes of the leader and those of the group (van Knippenberg &amp; van Knip penberg, 2005). The greater the leader's perceived prototypicality (i.e., the more that the leader is seen to reflect the group), the greater his or her potential to influence group members and the more effective his or her leadership tends to be. Because the social identity model of leadership focuses on groups, it includes a very important proviso: leader prototypicality is only likely to have an impact when a group's identity is salient and the group's members identify with the group. Absent group salience, members will not be primed to think about the group or its welfare, and absent identification, members will not be sufficiently mo tivated to act on the group's behalf. In contrast, our model focuses on the dyadic relationship between a given subordinate and his or her leader (and its impact on organizational identification), and thus: (1) we focus on relational identification rather than group identification2 and (2) we define leader pro 2 This model explicitly incorporates group salience because of the number of potential in-groups (and out groups) that may be relevant in a given setting (in an organization, for example, an individual may simultane</page><page sequence="13">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth totypicality as the extent to which a leader extols the organization's values (cf. Howell &amp; Shamir, 2005). Indeed, Lord and Brown argued that "the finding—that work values are organized along identity-related dimensions—is important for un derstanding the integrating of individuals within higher-level social units" (2001: 142). Newcomers are likely to perceived leader proto typicality through the type and focus of the training provided during their adjustment period (cf. Hart &amp; Miller, 2005). A highly prototypical leader will fo cus newcomers' learning and training on tasks and routines that support their organization's values rather than learning and training that just "passes muster" (i.e., focusing only on the short-term job or task-related goals). For example, a highly prototyp ical leader in a team-based organization (such as the one in our study) will emphasize the values of cooperating with fellow team members—even when it is inconvenient or difficult to do so. Con versely, a less prototypical leader may only empha size the general notion of teamwork. As argued, relational identification tends to gen eralize to organizational identification. Leader pro totypicality may further strengthen the generaliza tion across identification referents. As a newcomer perceives his or her leader promoting organiza tional values, the newcomer is also likely to per ceive his or her relationships with the leader and with the organization as more similar in meaning and purpose (cf. van Knippenberg, van Knippen berg, De Cremer, &amp; Hogg, 2004). The similarity or resemblance in meaning and purpose is crucial be cause "identities with common meanings will tend to be activated together" (Burke, 2003: 203; Stryker &amp; Burke, 2000). As such, the more the leader pro motes organizational values, the more the supervi sory relationship will resemble (and facilitate) the newcomer's organizational attachment—thus strengthening generalization of relational identifi cation to organizational identification. Hence: Hypothesis 5. A newcomer's perceptions of his/ her supervisor's prototypicality moderate the re lationship between the newcomer's relational identification with the supervisor and the new comer's organizational identification: The rela tionship is more positive when prototypicality is higher (given control for baseline levels of the newcomer's organizational identification). STUDY 2: METHODS Our sample consisted of 1,101 newcomers to the U.S. Army completing Basic Combat Training (BCT) at two military installations in the U.S. We administered surveys to newcomers at three time points during the nine-week BCT phase of their overall initial training into the U.S. Army.3 BCT is what Goffman (1961) would term a "total institu tion," a situation in which similar individuals live and work together, isolated from the outside world, for a considerable period of time. BCT provides an excellent opportunity to test the generalization model. Specifically, the socialization process expe rienced in BCT is highly structured and similar for most newcomers. Organization-level procedures and methods of socialization are clearly specified and routinely emphasized throughout the experi ence. The only sizable variability in the socializa tion process is the manner through which supervi sors (here, drill sergeants) interact with the newcomers. Although there is much interaction be tween the drill sergeants and a unit (as a whole), there are daily, significant one-on-one interactions between the drill sergeants and newcomers throughout BCT. As such, newcomers experience a personalized role relationship with the drill ser geants, suggesting the possibility of relational iden tification. Contrary to stereotypical characteriza tions, drill sergeants vary greatly in their leadership style, which may range from supportive and en couraging to highly demanding to hybrid (e.g., Klein, Salter, Riccio, &amp; Sullivan, 2006). Therefore, BCT is in many ways a naturally occurring experi ment in which the socialization "manipulation" unfolds over time and most of the variability is focused within supervisory relationships. Of course, a potential limitation is that this environ ment is more tightly controlled than typical organ izational environments. We discuss potential is sues with generalizability in the Discussion section. Timing We administered the time 1 survey within the first week of soldiers arriving at their BCT loca tions. During this period of three to five days, des ignated as "Reception," newcomers are given addi tional medical tests, are issued uniforms and other basic equipment, and complete final administrative "in-processing" before entering BCT. They do not meet or work with their training drill sergeants ously be a member of a project team, department, lunch group, seniority cohort, gender category, and manage ment cadre). In contrast, our model focuses on the over arching organization. 3 Note that the U.S. Army expanded BCT to ten weeks following the completion of data collection.</page><page sequence="14">962 Academy of Management Journal August during this time. The first (Tl) survey collected data for demographic control variables (see below). In addition, we collected data on the newcomer's organizational identification with the U.S. Army as a baseline temporally lagged control. The time 2 (T2) survey was administered four to five weeks after BCT began. At this point, newcomers had worked with their drill sergeants, three per unit or platoon, for approximately three to four weeks. Given the nature of the BCT environment, this pro vided enough time to establish a personalized role relationship (Hinde, 1997). The T2 survey focused on both the newcomers' identification with the drill sergeant relationship as well as how much each newcomer perceived the drill sergeants (as a unit) to be promoting prototypical values. Follow ing recommendations by Saks and Ashforth (1997), we administered the T3 survey approximately nine weeks after BCT began—that is, immediately before graduation from BCT. The time 3 survey focused on the dependent variable—the newcom ers' identification with the U.S. Army. Sample Description The Tl survey was completed by 1,863 individ uals. Of these, 1,611 (87%) completed the T2 sur vey. From these 1,611, 1,270 (79%) completed the T3 survey. After accounting for both missing data and individuals that responded to the T2 or T3 surveys but not the Tl survey, we had a final sam ple size of 1,101 (a 59 percent final response rate). For all subsequent analyses, we focus on this final sample. Note that a small portion (n = 104) partic ipated in an augmented introductory training and, as such, the time periods between surveys were somewhat longer. Because the results are identical with or without these individuals, we retained them in our final sample. Seventy-nine percent of the participants were male. The mean age was 22 years (s.d. = 4.5). Sixty percent were in the active or "regular" U.S. Army, whereas 40 percent were in either the U.S. Army Reserve or National Guard. Race/ethnic data were not collected per U.S. Army policy. Following graduation, the majority of these newcomers enter into a more focused phase of training in their mil itary occupational specialty. There are three broad classifications: (1) Combat Arms (e.g., Infantry); (2) Combat Support (e.g., Transportation); and (3) Combat Service Support (e.g., Finance). Of the 1,101 respondents, 66 percent were in Combat Ser vice Support, 21 percent in Combat Arms, and the remaining 13 percent in Combat Support. To con firm that attrition did not systemically bias our results, we conducted an attrition analysis (Good man &amp; Blum, 1996). We compared respondents (i.e., those who responded to all three surveys) to nonrespondents (i.e., did not respond to the sec ond, third, or both surveys) and found no signifi cant differences on the variables captured in the Tl survey (i.e., gender, age, classification [e.g., Combat Arms], regular army status, baseline organizational identification). Thus, we do not suspect the pres ence of nonrandom sampling bias due to attrition. With respect to nonresponse bias, recruits in our sample were the same age (22 years old) as the typical U.S. Army recruit. Nevertheless, our sample had fewer males (69%) than the typical U.S. Army recruiting cohort (77%) (U.S. Army, 2011b). Measures As in Study 1 and following Podsakoff and col leagues (2003), we included several safeguards in our design to reduce concerns about common method bias: (1) we separated the measurement of the independent and dependent variables by a tem poral lag of approximately one month; (2) we de signed the items within the surveys to increase psychological distance; and (3) we promoted par ticipant confidentiality. Note that only the research team was present during data collection. Relational identification (time 2 survey). We measured identification with supervisory relation ship by adapting the four-item scale developed in the first study. The response scale ranged from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree"). The items include "My work relationship with my Drill Sergeants is important to how I see myself." "My work relationship with my Drill Sergeants is an important part of who I am at work," "If someone criticized my work relationship with my Drill Ser geants, it would be a personal insult," and "My work relationship with my Drill Sergeants reflects the kind of person I am" (a = .90). Note that we adapted the first and fourth items for clarity. Prototypicality of supervisor (time 2 survey). Existing measures of perceived prototypicality do not assess the extent to which the referent promotes core values of the collective, and they confound in-group with organization (cf. van Knippenberg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2005). Thus, we conducted semi structured interviews with 15 drill sergeants (as part of an earlier data collection effort) to develop a measure of prototypicality in a way that specifi cally addressed how a supervisor promotes values indicative of the organization (i.e., U.S. Army) (see similar procedures in Shamir, Zakay, Brainin, and Popper [1998]). We asked drill sergeants (as supervisors) how they promoted core organizational values during</page><page sequence="15">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth 963 their interactions with newcomers. The drill ser geants focused their responses on the values of cooperation, loyalty, and working together as fel low soldiers. These team-oriented values aligned well with and encompassed the published U.S. Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless ser vice, honor, integrity, and personal courage (U.S. Army, 2011a). The interviews suggested various items that reflected the ways that drill sergeants promote these values. One should note that these values were perceived as prototypical U.S. Army values and not as unit-specific values during BCT. Before data collection and via one-on-one inter views, we tested these items for face and content validity with nine newcomers who were in their last two weeks of training (i.e., subject matter ex perts] and, therefore, were not part of our sample. We asked them to indicate which items best repre sented U.S. Army values. Four items were selected on the basis of these interviews. The response scale ranged from 1 ("never") to 5 ("always"). The newcomers were asked "How often do your Drill Sergeants do the following?" The items were "push us to help our platoon members," "tell us not to let the platoon down," "encourage us to be loyal," and "encourage us to use soldier lead ers to solve our problems" (a = .85). Given that our measure of prototypicality was designed to capture the extent to which newcomers perceived the drill sergeants to be promoting organization-wide (i.e., U.S. Army) values, we asked two face-valid items ("My Drill Sergeants teach us about Army values and history;" "My Drill Sergeants link the Army values to our training") as a validity check. The bivariate correlation between the prototypicality measure and this two-item face-valid measure was quite high (r = .84), giving us more confidence in how we operationalized prototypicality. As an anonymous reviewer pointed out, these behaviors could be cast as "generally effective leader behaviors [with] substantial conceptual overlap with transformational leadership." What makes this a measure of prototypicality is that the items were explicitly derived from the core U.S. Army values instilled during basic training (ac cording to the drill sergeants): cooperation, loyalty, and working together. If the Army had instead lauded other values, such as innovation and cre ativity, or self-reliance and initiative, then our items would have been very different—and yet such items, too, could be said to represent effective leader behaviors in certain settings. In short, leader prototypicality is always context-specific. Organizational identification (time 1 and time 3 surveys). We used five of the six items from Mael and Ashforth's (1992) organizational identification scale. The item "I am very interested in what others think of my organization [U.S. Army]" was judged to be not applicable given that newcomers are se questered from the outside world during BCT. Per prior research, we simply changed the referent from "organization" to "Army." Sample items are "When I talk about the Army, I usually say "we" rather than "they"" and "When someone praises the Army, it feels like a personal compliment" (a = .85). Control variables. Our potential control vari ables included gender, age, Regular Army status (vs. Reserve/National Guard), and classification. Gender and age are common demographic control variables (see Study 1), but whether a newcomer will serve full-time or part-time (i.e., Regular Army or other status) as well as the newcomer's broad occupational classification (i.e., Combat Arms, Combat Support, Combat Service Support) may also have potential covariance with organizational identification (cf. Mael &amp; Ashforth, 1992; Riketta, 2005). That said, nonsignificant control variables unnecessarily reduce statistical power (Becker, 2005). As such, we regressed our dependent vari able, organizational identification, on all potential control variables. Only Combat Arms classification was a significant predictor and was therefore re tained as a control in subsequent analyses—in ad dition to the baseline measure of organizational identification. Discriminant validity. Given the relatedness among our variables of interest (i.e., relational iden tification [T2], prototypicality [T2], and organiza tional identification [T3]), we tested for discrimi nant validity via confirmatory factor analysis. We hypothesized a three-factor model and, using AMOS 18.0, found that this model demonstrated excellent fit with all items loading significantly on their a priori factors (x2 = 219.87 [df = 62]; CFI = .98; TLI = .97; RMSEA = .05 [H0: RM SEA &lt; .05, p = .59]). We then compared the hy pothesized three-factor model to two alternative models. First, we compared our hypothesized model to a two-factor model wherein relational identification and prototypicality were combined into one factor and organizational identification remained separate. Second, we compared the hy pothesized model to a one-factor omnibus model. Both alternative models resulted in a less than sat isfactory fit and did not fit as well as the hypothe sized model (two-factor: x2 = 1,267.72 [df = 64]; CFI = .83; TLI = .79; RMSEA = .13 [H0: RM SEA &lt; .05, p = .00]; one-factor: x2 = 3,546.04 [df = 65]; CFI = .50; TLI = .40; RMSEA = .22 [H0: RMSEA &lt; .05, p = .00]).</page><page sequence="16">964 Academy of Management Journal August STUDY 2: RESULTS The descriptive statistics, alpha reliabilities, and correlations are presented in Table 2. To test our moderation hypothesis, Hypothesis 5, we con ducted moderated multiple regression analysis (Co hen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003). We standardized the independent variables (i.e., relational identifi cation, prototypicality). We then regressed organi zational identification on the predictors in three steps: (1) control variables (i.e., Combat Arms clas sification, baseline organizational identification); (2) independent variables (i.e., relational identifi cation, prototypicality); and (3) the interaction vari able (i.e., relational identification X prototypical ity). If the change in R2 is significant for step 3, then one can conclude the moderation is significant. Hypothesis 5 predicts that supervisor prototypi cality moderates the relationship between rela tional identification and organizational identifica tion in such a way that, under conditions of higher perceived prototypicality, the relationship will be stronger (i.e., more positive). The interaction term significantly predicted additional variance in or ganizational identification (0 = .16, p &lt; .01), indi cating initial support for Hypothesis 5 (see Table 3). To confirm that the form of the interaction sup ported the hypothesis, we plotted the interaction as per Cohen et al. (2003). The general pattern of the interaction supports our hypothesis (see Figure 3, below). We also computed the significance of the simple slopes (Preacher, Curran, &amp; Bauer, 2006). We found that the slope for the relationship be tween relational identification and organizational identification, in the high prototypicality condi tion, is significantly positive (j3 = .22, t — 6.88, p &lt; .01) whereas the slope in the low prototypical ity condition is not significantly different from zero (/3 = .02, t = 0.61, p &gt; .05). As such, we found full support for Hypothesis 5. Note, however, that in stead of just strengthening the relationship, higher prototypicality (in the findings here) is necessary for the relationship to reach significance. Finally, given that the subordinate data were nested within supervisors, we conducted hierarchal linear mod eling and found nearly identical results. Specifi cally, the unstandardized regression coefficient for the interaction term was nearly identical to the unstandardized coefficient from a random-coeffi cients model that took into account nested data (i.e., HLM: .098 vs. .099)—as was the statistical significance. Thus, the implications and conclu sions are identical. We argue that moderated regres sion is theoretically appropriate given that rela tional identification remains at the individual level of analysis (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007). GENERAL DISCUSSION Prior extensions to social identity and leadership theories suggest that an individual's supervisor plays an integral role in that person's sense of a workplace self—especially when he or she is new to their organization (see also Ashforth et al., 2008; Lord &amp; Brown, 2001; Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008). Nev ertheless, the bulk of research has examined how organizational practices and properties influence newcomer organizational identification, virtually ignoring supervisor impact on organizational iden tification. In addition, research on identifying with multiple referents often implies mutually exclusive (or competitive) relationships. Our two studies ad dressed these issues by showing the processes and conditional nature of how identification with the su pervisory relationship—relational identification— TABLE 2 Study 2: Descriptive Statistics, Reliability Coefficients, and Correlations8 Variable11 Mean s.d. 123456789 10 1.

We found complementary results in two studies spanning different contexts, organiza tions, and temporal spacings in research design. First, our studies provide a more specified an swer to calls for more fruitful integration of per sonal relationship research and organizational sci ence (Dutton &amp; Ragins, 2007; Ferris, Liden, Munyon, Summers, Basik, &amp; Buckley, 2009; Hinde, 1997; Pratt, 2000). The bulk of relationship-focused research in organizations has focused on an instru mental, exchange-based, and, by extension, deper sonalized notion of relationships (cf. Dutton &amp; Ra gins, 2007). In contrast, our findings suggest that organizationally bound role relationships are also built upon motives of identity and transformation, rather than just exchange and transaction, and have a significant place in organizational research. Many organizational behavior models rightly recognize both individual (e.g., personality, demographic, ability) and organization (e.g., climate, structure, team processes) yet relegate relationships to the background or treat them as just a minirepresenta tion of an organization. In the words of Dutton and Ragins, "This perspective not only ignores the sig nificance of workplace relationships but also takes a needlessly segmented view of people in the work place; that although relationships are central to em ployees' lives they are somehow able to turn off this need once they enter the workplace" (2007: 5). Our studies do not take this segmented view and indeed demonstrate how a personalized relationship can in spire and influence an organizational attachment via affective, cognitive, and behavioral conduits—in FIGURE 3 Moderating Effect of Prototypicality and Relational Identification on Organizational Identification 3 -I 2.5 - Organizational Identification 2 1.5 Low Relational Identification -Low prototypicality ■High prototypicality High Relational Identification</page><page sequence="18">966 Academy of Management Journal August deed, an organizational attachment that is tradition ally assumed to be impersonal rather than personal. Second, our findings from a multiorganizational sample of "teleservices" newcomers suggest that generalizing identification involves the "whole person" (Harquail, 1998)—namely, affective (i.e., affect transfer), cognitive (i.e., social influence), and behavioral aspects (i.e., behavioral sensemak ing). As Harquail aptly questioned, "We have lim ited our exploration into organizational identifica tion to this one [cognitive, individually oriented] perspective—what about interactionist perspec tives on identity, or relational models of the self and self-identity that depend not just on the indi vidual but also on others?" (1998: 231). Our studies bring empirical evidence to bear and extend previ ous theoretical advancements in showing how the symbolic interactionist perspective (Mead, 1934), via relational identification and its mediating mechanisms, influences the social (in our case, or ganizational) identification process (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986). Third, our findings from a large sam ple of U.S. Army newcomers suggest that relational identification generalizes to organizational identi fication when a supervisor promotes organiza tionally held values—in other words, when the su pervisor is perceived to be prototypical of his/her organization. In sum, the two studies indicate that identification as well as newcomer adjustment pro cesses are more relationally focused than previous research would suggest (cf. Dutton &amp; Ragins, 2007). Our findings provide important evidence (and guidance) on how multiple identifications are co operative rather than competitive. Theoretical Implications We found that affect transfer and social influ ence, as affective and cognitive mediating mecha nisms, equally influenced the generalization pro cess. Affect transfer is a spillover of felt affect from supervisory relationship to organization, whereas social influence is the process by which a supervi sor's presumably positive opinions of his/her or ganization shape a newcomer's overall opinion of the organization. Using bootstrapping analyses, we found that the indirect effects were not signifi cantly different from each other. There has been a long debate among applied psychology and man agement researchers concerning the strength of af fect and cognition (for an excellent review, see Brief [1998]). Brief concluded that affect and cog nition are so intertwined that decoupling the pro cesses is quite untenable. Our findings seem to un derline Briefs supposition that affect (i.e., affect transfer) and cognition (i.e., social influence) act more as equal partners than battling enemies—at least within the identification generalization process. The equal yoking of affect, cognition, and behav ior within the identification process seems to em phasize and explicate how organizational identifi cation is perhaps more personalized than is often supposed. Social identity theory (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986) and self-categorization theory (Hogg &amp; Terry, 2000) arguments are that organizational member ship (i.e., self-categorization) alone provides enough cognitive and affective fodder for identification with a collective (what Rousseau [1998] posited and la beled as "situated identification"). Although situated identification is no doubt valid, modern organiza tions seem to strive for employees (and newcomers) to identify on a deeper and more integrated level than simply categorizing themselves as organiza tion members—not only saying "we" but experi encing the "we" as well (cf. Ashforth et al., 2008). In this regard, the depersonalization hypothesis of social identity theory falls short. However, our findings on generalizing relational identification to organizational identification via affect transfer, so cial influence, and behavioral sensemaking provide insight into how newcomers' "employment can take on the significance of a personal relationship" (Rousseau, 1998: 222), thus complementing and putting a more personalized face on identity and identification in organizational settings. Perhaps the emphases in social identity theory and self categorization theory on bloodless cognitive cate gorizations and depersonalized attachments have helped blind scholars to the important role that personalized relationships play in helping individ uals come to understand, care about, and ulti mately identify deeply with organizations and the collectives within them. Similarly, the two studies provide a more systematic and empirical way to integrate social identity theory and role identity theory (cf. Burke &amp; Stets, 2009; Stryker &amp; Burke, 2000). Organizational identification is squarely un der the purview of social identity theory (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986) whereas relational identification, al though informed by social identity theory, is under the auspices of role identity theory from both a structural-functional and symbolic interactionist perspective (Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2007; Sluss, van Dick, &amp; Thompson, 2010). Our findings suggest that the personalization inherent in generalizing rela tional identification to organizational identifica tion may help integrate and reconcile social iden tity theory and role identity theory, which in the past have been treated as largely independent (Ash forth et al., 2008; Hogg, Terry, &amp; White, 1995). Our findings concerning affect, cognition, and behavior from Study 1 also provide insight into the</page><page sequence="19">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth 967 newcomer adjustment literature. First, regarding af fect transfer, our findings speak directly to the pau city of research in the socialization literature re garding how emotion and mood play a role within the process (Ashforth &amp; Saks, 2002; cf. Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996). Although we found that affect transfer occurs between supervisory relationship and organization, it seems reasonable that affect may also spill over between, for example, a new comer's cohort and the newcomer's more senior coworkers, as these two referents are primed to gether through both classroom and on-the-job train ing. Second, social influence may become a cogni tive conduit for learning about and adjusting to the newcomer's task, group, role, and organization (e.g., Ashforth &amp; Rogers, in press; Smith, Plowman, &amp; Duchon, 2010). Indeed, social influence and its positive leanings may also facilitate the newcom er's engaging in positive framing (Ashford &amp; Black, 1996), thereby increasing adjustment to the task, role, group, and organization. Third, behavioral sensemaking—attributing behavior directed toward one target as implicitly directed to other related targets—provides the newcomer a way to "try on" the organization for size and become retroactively attached to the new job, people, and organization as a whole. Research has established that identifica tion with a given target motivates individuals to engage in behaviors that benefit targets (e.g., extra role behaviors [Riketta, 2005]). Although not dis agreeing with this overall finding, our study seems to support a reciprocal relationship in that behavior toward one target appears able to influence identi fication with related targets. In short, '"I act,' there fore 'I am'" (cf. Burke &amp; Reitzes, 1981). A newcomer to Hewlett-Packard may not initially see them selves as an "HPer," yet after consistently acting the "HP way" (Packard, 1995), the newcomer may start to define him- or herself as one (cf. Bern, 1972). The finding that newcomers "behave their way" to organizational identification (Ashforth, 2001) leads us to the major finding of the second study: relational identification does indeed generalize to organizational identification, but more so when a supervisor is perceived to support and represent organizational values—that is, is perceived to be prototypical. As such, we extend the social identity model of leadership (Hogg, 2001; van Knippenberg &amp; Hogg, 2003) in that we relax the assumption that followers must identify strongly with the collective (in our case, the sampled organization) for proto typicality to hold sway in the leader-follower rela tionship. We instead demonstrate that prototypi cality is part of the identification generalization process rather than an outcropping of it. In addi tion, the social identity model assumption is that these mechanisms work via depersonalization— that is, that leaders are seen as somewhat faceless yet exemplary representatives of the collective. In stead, our findings show that the social identity model of leadership also applies when a relation ship is personalized, via relational identification. Exploring prototypicality within the identifica tion generalization process also challenged a com mon assumption that all supervisors generally por tray their organization as positive and are supportive of organizational values (as is assumed in social influence). Indeed, whereas social influ ence was assumed to convey pro-organizational content, prototypicality actually captures the con tent and variability with which supervisors portray organizationally esteemed values. In other words, although managers may be expected to be prototyp ical, prototypicality does vary and significantly in fluences the intensity with which a supervisor-sub ordinate relationship becomes psychologically intertwined with the organization in which the su pervisor and subordinate work. Indeed, the fact that lower supervisor prototypicality nullified gen eralization versus causing a negative moderating relationship is important. It seems logical that, given the proximity of the supervisory relationship to newcomers, higher relational identification and lower prototypicality would actually interact to translate into lower organizational identification (following, in a sense, an augmented version of balance theory [Heider, 1958]). However, we found that lower prototypicality instead negated the con nection between supervisory relationship and new comer bonding with organization. As such, proto typicality makes the relational self "more or less" situationally relevant for the collective self (cf. Ashforth &amp; Johnson, 2001). Note that being nonpro totypical is not equal to being antitypical—wherein a supervisor actively contradicts an organization's values. We speculate that although some supervi sors may desire to be antitypical, in practice, insti tutionalized role expectations prevail (Jackall, 1988), and they will instead just abstain from en dorsing organizational values—that is, enact low supervisor prototypicality (Meyerson's [2001] "tempered radicals" may be comparable). Future Directions The findings taken together inspire several im portant future directions for research on identifica tion within organizational settings and, more gen erally, on how organizing occurs. First, although the supervisory relationship is quite important, other salient role relationships may also be fruitful candidates for study, such as those with senior</page><page sequence="20">968 Academy of Management Journal August peers/coworkers, clients, and the like. For example, software development organizations implement "paired programming" wherein two programmers share one computer while writing code together. This highly interactive context would seem to elicit a situation that is ripe not only for how attachment at the interpersonal level influences attachment with the collective, but also for how role-based and person-based expectations meld as these pairs or ganize and work together, which inherently influ ences important outputs for their organization. In short, the situation may be such that relational identification generalizes to organizational identi fication—although a relationship and an organiza tion may not be so tightly intertwined. Indeed, coworker relationships may involve, at times, more antitypical goals and values (e.g., Collinson, 1992), creating situations for both mutually cooperating and competing goals and values. In a related fashion, some relationships may not be structurally nested in a particular collective, yet cer tain conditions may still psychologically connect the relationship and the collective (e.g., task interdepen dence [Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008]). Similarly, the con nectedness between additional role relationships and/or collectives may transcend structural boundar ies to influence identification and other forms of at tachment (e.g., commitment, satisfaction, fit) with "nonconnected" (and assumed to be competing) ref erents. For example, mentorship may result in a deep and personalized relationship in which the lines are blurred between organization and career in such a way that the mentor-protege relationship may influ ence attitudes and behaviors within the protege's overall career. Indeed, the relationship and subse quent attitudes may endure long after relational in cumbents no longer share organizational member ship. In the end, it may be that the extent to which the relational and the collective are nested becomes a matter of perception rather than (structural) reality. Second, future research should more fully expli cate how identifications generalize and even con verge (see Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008). Testing the medi ating mechanisms and moderating condition simultaneously may better specify how the indirect effects function in the generalization process. Re search should also attempt to replicate and test addi tional mediating mechanisms, such as anthropomor phization (wherein relational partners ascribe "relational qualities to the collective" as a whole [Sluss &amp; Ashforth, 2008: 813; Waytz, Epley, &amp; Ca cioppo, 2010]), that were implicitly assumed constant in our studies. Future research might attempt to not only validate the relatively equal importance of affect, cognition, and behavior in identification, but also explore the temporal ordering or primacy of these mediating mechanisms (Harquail, 1998). Further, fu ture research might explore the relationships among the mediating mechanisms and the motives associ ated with identification, including self-enhancement, belonging, and uncertainty reduction. Third, relational identification was treated as an exogenous variable in our studies, raising the ques tion of what variables may foster such identification in the first place. We noted that, from the perspective of a newcomer, both the perceived valence of the supervisor's role vis-a-vis the newcomer and the manner in which the supervisor enacts the role influ ence the attractiveness of their relationship as a basis for identification. Thus, future research might ad dress possible distal antecedents, such as organiza tional culture (e.g., a "clan" culture's emphasis on participation and development [Cameron, Quinn, De graff, &amp; Thakor, 2006]) and structure (e.g., a hierarchi cal, "command-and-control" structure may discour age a subordinate's identification with his/her supervisory relationship), and proximal antecedents such as leader-member exchange (Martin, Epitropaki, Thomas, &amp; Topakas, 2010), transformational leader ship (Walumbwa &amp; Hartnell, 2011), and perceived supervisor support (Eisenberger, Stinglhamber, Van denberghe, Sucharski, &amp; Rhoades, 2002). In addition, as Sluss and Ashforth (2008) pointed out, just as relational identification spills over to organizational identification, organizational identification may also influence relational identification—albeit via differ ent mediating mechanisms. We suggest comparing and contrasting these reciprocal processes. Finally, it may be fruitful to apply the generaliza tion principle (wherein attitudes toward two con nected entities tend to spill over) to other organiza tional behavior constructs. For example, it seems that perceptions of exchange with a relational other may converge with perceptions of exchange with an or ganization and vice versa (see research on perceived organizational support [Shanock &amp; Eisenberger, 2006]). The same likely also holds for investigating perceptions of fit across referents (see Kristof-Brown and Jansen's [2007] review). Organizational science has seen a proliferation of attachment-related con structs such as identification, fit, commitment, psy chological ownership, and job embeddedness, with the bulk of associated theory forwarding a mix of individual differences and organizational context an tecedents while ignoring the "tribal" or relational context (Ashforth &amp; Rogers, in press). The generaliza tion principle may therefore provide significant in sight touching on these different constructs and foci. For instance, perhaps positive affect generated from feeling psychological ownership of one's job may spill over to a stronger sense of normative commit</page><page sequence="21">2012 Sluss, Ployhart, Cobb, and Ashforth 969 ment to one's job: "I feel ownership of my job; thus I feel socially obligated to perform" (cf. Cohen, 2003). Managerial Implications There are several implications for management. First, managers of newcomers and other employees need to pay attention to not only the opinions shared but also the mood and emotion engendered in their relationships with their subordinates. As the support of affect transfer demonstrates, affect is a major conduit through which attitudes about one entity transfer to another. Accordingly, managers should focus on creating an environment in which positive feelings are engendered so that a positive transfer can take place. As noted, most newcomers want a "caring boss" (and by extension a "caring organization"). It seems that managers could help newcomers implement positive framing (Ashford &amp; Black, 1996) so as to see challenges as opportuni ties. We suggest that an environment in which per sonal work goals and positive framing are encour aged and supported should facilitate the positive feelings. Second, organizations should be very careful in selecting which managers or supervisors will train newcomers. Many organizations develop socialization programs that only emphasize such factors as company policies, benefits, and similar transactive forms of knowledge. Our findings sug gest that organizations should also think carefully about who conducts socialization and how they do so—indeed, something that Van Maanen and Schein (1979) suggested over 30 years ago. Third, it seems wise for organizations to also provide train ing to help managers understand which values are most prototypical and how to promote these values. Finally, given the impact that relational identifica tion has on organizational identification, "on boarding programs" would do well to facilitate pro organizational interpersonal relationships. For example, an organization's mentoring program might actively involve multiple mentors—who are prototypical of the organization's values. Limitations Several limitations of our studies should be noted. First, all the variables were collected from the same source, individual newcomers. That said, we: (1) separated (temporally) the collection of our predictor, mediator (when applicable), and crite rion and (2) performed tests for discriminant valid ity to reduce concern regarding common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Second, the generaliz ability of our findings can be questioned. However, we argue that our samples may have resulted in a more conservative test of the theory. For instance, given the tenuous nature of telemarketing jobs (e.g., low professional status, high turnover), a newcomer's relationships with his/her manager and organization may not be highly important. In short, the employee may focus on the task at hand and the transactional nature of the job—being on the phone, making sales, and then moving on. Regardless, we found that the identification processes were significant. In addition, our second study focused on newcomers to the U.S. Army—considered a "total institution" (Goffman, 1961). Newcomers in a total institution may experi ence socialization very differently than those in other organizations (Ashforth et al., 2007a). Nevertheless, many large organizations, such as Cisco Systems, Google, Yahoo, IBM, Starbucks, IDEO, and Microsoft, are known for their strong socialization processes and somewhat overpowering (albeit not "total institu tion") approach. For example, senior Cisco Systems employees tell newcomers, "Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated" (in reference to the Borg of the TV series, "Star Trek—The Next Generation" [Paulson, 2001]). Third, given that prototypicality is necessarily context-specific, our measure of proto typicality is purposefully narrow and oriented to the U.S. Army. In addition, our measure may only be capturing what is prototypical during the initial (and critical) training phase for soldiers—and not what is prototypical later on in an Army career. As such, our measure was not intended to be widely generalizable, although it may be adaptable to contexts in which teamwork is paramount. Given prototypicality's im portance in the generalization process, we recom mend future research strive to uncover behaviors that are contextually rich and distinct for the particular organization. Scholars may find better predictive power matching prototypicality specifically to con text (cf. van Knippenberg &amp; van Knippenberg, 2005). Conclusion Our studies tested a recent theoretical advance in research on multiple identifications and newcomer adjustment: identification generalization. We found that, in the newcomer context, relational identification does converge with organizational identification (in Study 1) through affective, cogni tive, and behavioral mechanisms—yet (in Study 2), only when a newcomer perceives the relational other as prototypical of the organization. We there fore provide evidence and guidance on the pro cesses and conditions by which an individual's supervisor plays an integral role in identification generalization. We also provide evidence that mul tiple identifications may be more holistic and com plementary than previously assumed.</page><page sequence="22">Academy of Management Journal REFERENCES Anderson, J.
