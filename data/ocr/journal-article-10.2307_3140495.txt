<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEED OF A NEW APOLOGETIC: FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SCIENCE. BY PROFESSOR JOHN M. COULTER, PH.D., The University of Chicago. THE thoughtful adherents of Christianity certainly appreciate the fact that its presentation must be adjusted to the increasing body of scientific truth. To hazard religion upon the issue involved in denying matters of definite experience is not to be thought of. In a scientific age the result would be to alienate the increasing thousands who have inhaled the atmosphere of the modern laboratory; alld to conxrert a powerful and possibly helpful influence into a serious obstruction. In such an adjust- ment it would be both hazardous and futile to deal with the details of science, for they are ever increasing and shifting, dis- solving and recrystallizing. One of the fundamental blunders of the old apologetic, from the point of view of science, has been its assumption of authority in connection with details of scien- tific thought. Grievous injury to the cause of Christianity has been done by ex cathedra statements in reference to the methods and doctrines of science by those who are recognized to be unqualified to speak upon such subjects. It is fundamental for the new apologetic to recognize the limitations that increasing knowledge has put upon the individual. For one to pass upon matters that belong to specialists in another field of investiga- tion is to imperil his real message. Therefore, the new apologetic is not to conform to the details of scientific investigation but to the scientific attitude of mind. It matters little what scientific theories are advanced or with- drawn. They are certainly never withdrawn because of ignorant opposition, but only OI1 account of advance in knowledge. The overthrow of any scientific hypothesis that has been opposed by representatives of Christianity is never a vindication of that reli- gion, but a triumph of scientific investigation. The new apolo- 284</page><page sequence="2">285 TEE XEED OF A XEW AZPOLOGETIC getic must hold judgment in suspense, assured that if a hypothesis is false it will come to naught, and that if it is true no amount of opposition can withstand it. Antr opinion based upon ignorance is essentially prejudiced and worthless, and must react unfavorably upon the cause it is claimed to represent. The spirit of the new apologetic, therefore, is to recognize in scien- tific investigation a very important and a very special field of work whose announced results are to be received with respect and caution, and concerning the truth of which only further scientific investigation is competent to decide. This, however, merely deals with the attitude of the new apologetic; and although it implies suppression of opinion without adequate knowledge, it does not mean that the assured results of science are not to be used. In fact, they must be appropriated, for they enormously strengthen any claim for recognition made by Chris- tianity. Perhaps the most fundamental and far-reaching change that science demands of the new apologetic is the abandonment of the anthropomorphic conception of God. The Bible and Chris- tian literature are saturated with this conception, and to the sci- entific mind nothing can be more gross and grotesque. A deified man was probably the extreme possible stretch of the religious imagination of primitive times, and this outgrown conception has come to us as a sacred heritage. In the same primitive times the most conspicuous phenomena of nature were referred to such men, and among such pagan deities the Jehovah of the Hebrews took his place, greater than the deities of the heathen, but none the less a deified man. In recent times the phenomena of nature have been furnished a new terminology, but the terminology relating to Jehovah is still ancient in the extreme. This is responsible for no small amount of so-called atheism among scientific men, which is really a recoil from the grotesqueness of the anthropomorphic terminology, rather than from some rational conception of God. Certain results of the anthropomorphic conception of God were inevitable, and many of the fantastic beliefs of an early age confront the scientific man of today in the ordinary presentation</page><page sequence="3">286 TEE BIBLICAL WORLD of Christianity, and repel him. For example, this deified man must be a king, because the position of king was formerly the highest known among men. Naturally there followed all the methods and trappings of a king in a selfish and despotic age. It only remained to set this king apart in unapproachable maj- esty, surrounded by a brilliant court, touching the various inter- ests of his kingdom through messengers, and, if the ordinary terminology is to be trusted capricious to the last degree. With our present conceptions of the universe, with its inconceivable extent and complexity, what more incongruous conception of its creator and ruler could be conceived of ! To persist in the presentation of such a conception does incalculable damage; to many minds it makes Christianity merely one of the historic and outgrown religions. Perhaps the most pernicious result of the anthropomorphic conception of God was his removal from the immediate vicinity of his operations, and his becoming " an absentee God," as Carlyle called him. This involved the idea of his being some- thing quite apart from man and nature, transcendent ancl not immanent. This further demanded his localization in the uni- verse, and an actual place of residence was set apart in imagina- tion, and, still using the terminology of a flat earth, this was thought of as "above." In fact, our whole presentation of religion may be said to be still in terms of a central and flat earth. All of the impossibilities of the situation are so apparent to the student of science that he is not attracted, and he demands a God who fits into the universe as he knows it. This same conception of God as a deified and kingly man who rules the universe has been largely responsible for certain conceptions of prayer that are among our most persistent relics. A king is to be placated and can grant material favors. Hence it was natural, in ancient times, for prayer to God to take this same form, without any reference to the spiritual relation it expressed5 and which was the only real thing. To take plagues and tempests and earthquakes as an indication of divine dis pleasure was allowable in an age ignorant of the meaning of natural phenomena; but to continue this attitude in an age of</page><page sequence="4">287 TEE XE7kD OF A XEW APOLOGETIC science is discreditable. The contrast between a God concerned in the orderly operations of the universe, and one capable of responding to the diverse and contradictory and trivial requests that often take the form of prayers, needs only to be stated to convince one as to which is the worthier. In considering the anthropomorphic conception of God, and some of the further conceptions that have been derived from it, it would seem to some as if the whole structure of Christianity were involved. To such even a reverent discussion would be painful. But we are merely dealing with an ancient terminol- ogy, which has run conceptions into rigid molds that hold no relation to present knowledge. My contention is that the old molds should be broken, so that an adequate conception of God may take form and a new terminology may propagate and fix it. First and foremost, if there is a God at all, with such rela- tions to the universe as are attributed to him, science demands that he be immanent rather than transcendent, literally omni- present rather than existing in splendid isolation. The concep- tion of the nat-ure of the universe and of its control reached by science is infinitely more refined than that presented by any religion; so that to the scientific man the conceptions of the latter seem like the fancies of children, and in a certain sense such they are. That the representatives of Christianity really believe in the immanence, the literal omnipresence of God, is probably true; but much of their terminology, and hence implied conceptions, flatly contradict it. The manifestations called matter and mind are so bound up together as forms of expression of a universal and infinitely pervasive and tenuous ether that scientific men have come to a conception of univer- sality, of omnipresence, of unity of origin, that no expression of religion has obtained. Accept this immanence, and the anthropomorphic idea dis- appears, with its deified man, its king with a throne and royal trappings, its localized residence, its appeal for material favors its impossible relation to knowledge. I n its stead there is recognized an all-t)ervasive and sustaining power, from which</page><page sequence="5">288 TEE BIBLICAXL WORLD all things have come; and in whose manifestations the Christian recognizes a spirit related to his own, with whom he can have communion, and to whose infinite capacity he can intrust himself. A second fundamental adjustment that the progress of scien- tific knowledge demands may be called cosmological. Here again the shifting details of modern cosmology are to be avoided, but the old point of view must be changed. Of course, I venture to speak only of cosmology as it deals with the material universe. No one doubts that in ancient times the origin and structure and mechanism of the material universe were most fantastically explained. No one ought to doubt that the literature of those times, so far as it referred to the material universe, would record these irrational conceptions. Perhaps it was natural to single out the Bible as the one collection of ancient writings whose allusions to the material universe did not bear the marks of an unscientific age. However, it must always have been difficult to explain away the apparent genetic connec- tion between the biblical and the ancient non-biblical cosmol- ogles. The persistent holding on to an ancient cosmology in the face of a continuous advance in scientific knowledge has been one of the most damaging attitudes thrust upon Christianity by its misguided adherents. It developed that fratricidal war commonly misnamed the "conflict between science and relig- ion," but more properly called a conflict between science and theology. The contest was particularly unfortunate, since science was steadily victorious, and in the thought of many became a natural antagonist of religion, so that to them a Christian scientist became almost inconceivable. In my judg- ment, however, the most serious injury came to the great body of scientific men who were not interested enough to distinguish between an antiquated theology and the fundamentals of relig- ion, and who took what they recognized as being the fanatical statements of ignorance as fairly representing the whole scheme of religion. I freely grant that some of them were unwise onough to be goaded into counter-attacks, and to weaken their</page><page sequence="6">TVE XEED OF A Vk-H' APOLOGETIC 289 own case by presuming knowledge in a field other than their own. This is certainly not the scientific spirit, but an exhibi- tion of uncontrolled human nature. Of course, this was never the universal attitude of Christian leaders, among whom are follnd some of our most distinguished men of science; but the attitude was suiciently general and oicial to develop a per- sistent impression that science and the church were in conflict. When flat denial and charges of atheism were no longer able to support the ancient and tottering cosmology, an epoch of harmonizing the cosmologic statements of the Bible with the irrefutable discoveries of science began. Of course, this was but the beginning of the end, for it acknowledged the truth of certain important scientific claims, and the attempt to discover their statement in the terms of the ancient cosmology was such an appeal to the imagination that it could not last long. A statement that could mean now one thing, and later diametric- ally the opposite thing, dependent upon the knowledge injected into it by the reader, could be classified fairly along with the utterances of the Delphic oracle. The injustice done to the simple and very natural conceptions of the early writers does not seem to have been considered. Perhaps the most stubborn stand, and probably the last serious one, taken by the ancient cosmology against the new, was the resistance to the doctrine of evolution. When this doc- trine included man, a thing which it could not well avoid, there seemed to many to be an attack upon some of the fundamentals of the Christian religion; and even those who had gladly adjusted their beliefs to an evolution of the solar system, of the earth, and even of plants and the lower animals, drew back in alarm at the proposition to include man. But I fancy that even this thought is becoming slowly assimilated. Here certainly there is no occasion for me to contrast the conception of an infinite and progressive evolution of the universe with previous concep- tions as to its origin and methods. Such a conception consorts with the all-pervasive conception of God; while the preceding ones are linked with the anthropomorphic conception of God. Of course, such a cosmology demands not merely a change in</page><page sequence="7">290 TEE BIBLICw4L WORLD terminologJ,, but practically a restatement of the Christian standpoint. We all recognize that our experience lies in a transition period, with its inevitable anxiety and restlessness. But the times are ripening for some great constructive theologian, who will take the new and greater conception of God, and the new and infinitely more refined cosmology, and in their terms restate the eternal truths of the Christian religion. As a summary, I can not do better than quote these words from John Fiske: The thinker in whose mind divine action is identified with orderly action, and to whom a really irregular phenomenon would seem like a mani- festation of sheer diabolism, foreseec in every possible extension of knowledge a fresh confirmation of his faith in God. From his point of view there can be no antagonism between our duty as inquirers and our duty as worshipers. To him no part of the universe is godless. In the swaying to and fro of molecules and the ceaseless pulsations of ether, in the secular shiftings of planetary orbits, in the busy work of frost and rain-drop, in the mysterious sprouting of the seed, in the everlasting tale of death and life renewed, in the dawning of the babe's intelligence, in the varied deeds of men from age to age, he finds that which awakens the soul to reverential awe; and each act of scientific explanation but reveals an opening throughwhich shines the glory of the Eternal Majesty.</page></plain_text>
