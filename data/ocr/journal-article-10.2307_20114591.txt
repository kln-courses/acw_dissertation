<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM RUDDICK CAUSAL CONNECTION* Philosophers often attend to our common judgments, however casual or erroneous. The language we commonly use and the errors we commonly make are supposed to clarify the principles of sound judgment. That supposition has, I think, been justified by the results of attending closely to our common judgments in matters of perception, morals, and logic. But curiously, philosophers have tended to neglect our common causal judgments. They have been causal snobs preoccupied with 'the right causes', those endorsed by the scientific ?lite. There is concern only with long-established causes such as billiard balls, freezing water, flipped swithes, and indigestible dinners. The popular causes of the common man - fate, charms, conspiracies, and various divinities - are beneath consider ation and contempt. Even causes once favored by scientists themselves are neglected: the planet Vulcan attracts no more philosophic attention than its ancient namesake. This penchant for the scientist's current causes has been, I think, both a cause and an effect of unduly restrictive analyses of causation, causal error, and causal explanation. If the only phenomena considered are those subject to laboratory isolation and variation, it becomes tempting to identify the concept of cause with rules for finding true causes, causal error with misuse of those rules, and causal explanation with scientific laws and conditions that permit accurate prediction. Conversely, these identifications once made will restrict attention to the scientist's causes and explanations. Who but a scientist knows the rules for discovering "the whole of the contingencies of every description, which being realized, the consequent invariably follows", or even "an insufficient but necessary part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the result"?1 If that is what it takes to be the, or even a cause of an event, who but physicists and chemists know of causes? By the standards set by such definitions, our daily causal judgments are bound to seem crude, hasty, and capricious, and our causal errors are bound to seem na?ve and easily correctible. And if causal explanation is, or requires deduction from 46 Synthese 18 (1968) 46-67. &gt; D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">CAUSAL CONNECTION laws and conditions, our ordinary explanations will be as rough and sketchy as Professor Hempel would have us believe. Given these defini tions and analyses, philosophers are bound to think common causal judgments a waste of time. I am not, however, inclined to accept these identifications, and I do not find common causal judgments a waste of time. In the hope of breaking the spell of the scientist's causes and the restrictions of the positivist doctrine of causation, I wish to examine some of our common causal errors and common causal statements. This examination will reveal a special relation between some causes and their effects, that of congruity. In forming causal hypotheses, in choosing which causal hypothesis to test, and in retaining causal hypotheses even against the evidence, we tend to be guided by considerations of congruity. And, likewise, congruity with a given effect is often the basis for our choice of one from among several equally necessary causal factors as the cause of the effect we want explained. Such choices reflect the fact that congruity is a main source of explanatory power. I do not wish to claim that congruity is either a necessary or sufficient condition for an event to explain another. Either claim would require arguments which, in its present state of definition, this notion of con gruity cannot provide. Accordingly, I do not expect to worry or satisfy adherents of the positivist account of causation and causal explanation. But I hope at least to suggest that the positivist attempt to give a formal, syntactic analysis of causal explanation ignores the fact that our descrip tive language contains explanatory connections. My talk of congruity is a way of attracting attention to this fact, for congruity is a semantic, or intensional connection. A cause and an effect are congruous if they are describable by terms that are congruous, and congruous terms are seman tically connected in ways I shall illustrate even if not completely charac terize. A catalogue of common causal misjudgments will help to introduce and justify this notion of congruity. I. MISJUDGED CAUSES We are inclined to think some putative causes are better than they prove to be, and others worse. Of those we overvalue, there are the Fictitious 47</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM RUDDICK Cause, the Spurious Cause, and the Vacuous Cause. Of those we under value, there are the Paradoxical Cause, the Incommensurable Cause, the Chance Cause, and the Heterogeneous Cause. The Fictitious Cause is the biggest and most hopeless liar. It is a double deceiver, being an alleged object (event, property, or process) which is (or was) falsely believed to exist and falsely believed to have certain effects. Such totally false causes abound in folk and children's tales, as well as in the histories of both genuine and pseudo-sciences. Supernatural decrees, ghosts, both Vulcans (god and planet), entelechies, and the horror vacui are examples. They are hopeless causes, for eventual rejection as frauds is their only fate. A Spurious Cause tells fewer lies. While fictitious causes lie about both their existence and their efficacy, spurious causes lie only about their efficacy: they exist, but do not do what they are taken to do. Perhaps for this reason, spurious causes command a wider audience, even among the practical-minded. Being perceptible, they demand less faith than do fictitious causes, and can fool even taxi-drivers, historians, and doctors (whether amateur or professional). I have in mind such spurious causes as travellers' charms, 'the great men' of history, purgings and vitamins. Like fictitious causes, they face eventual exposure. The Vacuous Cause that Moli?re taught us to ridicule has, by contrast, more hope. To begin with, vacuous causes are not totally empty. When in Le Malade imaginaire, the mock candidate for the Faculty of Medicine tells his mock examiners that opium makes one sleep because there is in it a soporific quality whose nature it is to dull the senses, he is saying more than is usually allowed. By assigning opium a quality or power, he has committed it to having a general effect, that is, an effect on most men in most circumstances. And by locating that quality in opium, he has excluded the possibilities that opium is a mere placebo dependent for its action on the false beliefs of patients, or that opium is a mere pharma ceutical base or incidental medium. Moreover, unless sleep is defined as a dulling of the senses, the candidate has even suggested a way in which opium exercises its virtus dormitiva, namely by dulling the senses. His future patients would not be wrong in thinking that Argan knew something.2 But, no doubt, they would take him to know more than what was implied by the mere naming and locating of the cause. Un critically, they might suppose him to know details of structure and 48</page><page sequence="4">CAUSAL CONNECTION physiological action that were not known for centuries.3 The deceit of a (near-)vacuous causal diagnosis lies not in its seeming to say something, but in its seeming to say more than current knowledge entitles it to say or imply. Some near-vacuous causes, however, live to see their pretensions made good by subsequent discoveries. Accordingly, of the three over valued causes, vacuous causes are least deceitful and most hopeful. But why, we should wonder, are we prey to any of these deceits? Perhaps the vices most often blamed for causal error - hasty generaliza tion and uncured anthropomorphism - are at fault here. Logic texts say that superstitions are often the result of the jump from post hoc to propter hoc, from chance conjunction to lawful connection, and perhaps beliefs in spurious causes have such an origin. Belief in fictitious and vacuous causes, on the other hand, might seem to derive from the desire for humanoid agents throughout nature. According to various students of our past, such a desire appears in our earliest selves - the primitive tribes man, the child, and the Greek philosopher. And according to philoso phers, our concept of power or force - deriving as it does from our experience of moving limbs and chairs - shows that we still seek to satisfy this desire. Are not fate, ghosts, and entelechies but further satisfactions? Perhaps. But haste and self-projection alone cannot account for many of these misbeliefs. Superstition conjoins certain events which have prob ably never been observed together, and hence have never given hasty generalizers a chance. (Have seven years of bad luck ever dogged a mirror breaker? Has a child, having stepped on a sidewalk crack, ever found his mother at home with a newly broken back?) Conversely, most chance conjunctions give rise to no false generalizations. Superstition seems choosey. Since Frazer, anthropologists have noted a pattern among primitive causal practices. Magicians tend to be homeopaths, following a principle of 'sympathy' (or 'direct symbolism', or 'similarity'). A cause must re semble its effect. Thus, to induce rain, the magician scatters water from a tree, or carries an undiapered infant through the field. To insure fertile fields, pregnant women are set to sowing at full moon or high tide. To cure slow speech, a diet of lizard tongues is prescribed. If chance conjunctions had any part in the origin of these practices, it was the resemblance of the conjuncts, not their conjunction that invited causal inferences. 49</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM RUDDICK Moreover, many causal misbeliefs are too tenacious to arise from chance conjunction and hasty generalization. Were this their origin,they should be short-lived. The first failure of the chance conjunction would expose them. But as we learn from missionaries, anthropologists and our own vain attempts at persuasion, causal misbeliefs can withstand not just one, but constant failure of co-occurrence. The other common diagnosis of causal error, anthropomorphism, is less easily dismissed. Theorists differ as to which of our various aspects we are most anxious to find among natural phenomena. According to most philosophers, we tend to project ourselves as physical agents: choosing to move our limbs or our chairs and doing so is the paradigm for natural causation. According to other theorists, however, our para digm is social action. According to Kelsen, the Greeks took what we now call the natural order to be a moral order; for them, an effect was a retributive punishment which a cause, as a disturbance of a just balance, inescapably called down upon itself.4 According to Piaget, a child attri butes life and consciousness to natural objects so that they may be capable of responding to directions and commands, especially those issued by the child himself.5 In this, children resemble L?vy-Bruhl's primitives: cooperation, or joint participation is the aspect of human life projected into nature.6 Let us suppose (contrary to subsequent critics) that these claims are well-supported, and let us suppose further that we are still Greek, child like, and primitive in our causal desires. Nonetheless, before anthropo morphism can be an adequate explanation of causal mistakes, we must investigate the appeal of these paradigms of physical and social actions. Why is the alleged desire to have nature be like us - retributive, responsive to command and cooperative - strong enough to make men blind to evidence of causal mistake? I shall suggest an answer, but not until a very different kind of mistake is catalogued. We not only overvalue alleged causes ; we undervalue them. That is, we not only form and retain causal hypotheses independently of evidence; we also resist causal hypotheses independently of evidence. We hesitate to allow as causes what subsequent research proves to be a cause, or at least a causal factor. Upon hearing of such alleged causes, we react, "But how could that be the cause?" This is no request for details of production, but an incredulous challenge. Nonetheless, certain details of production can on occasion remove our resistance. 50</page><page sequence="6">CAUSAL CONNECTION The most repugnant of such undervalued causes is the Paradoxical Cause. Our repugnance and suspicion, even when there is statistical support for such a cause, are understandable, for a paradoxical cause is one whose description is logically incompatible with that of its alleged effect. For example, several years ago it was reported that highly excitable school-children had been tranquilized by a certain stimulant. "But how", people reacted, "could a stimulant tranquilize anyone, let alone a school-child?" I do not know how such resistance was in fact overcome but I know how it could be. Suppose the children's hyperexcitability proved to be due to a Aypoactive inhibitory center in the midbrain, and suppose further that the paradoxical drug was shown to stimulate that center. The clash between stimulant and tranquilization would be resolved by this third, mediating factor. There is nothing paradoxical about a stimulant stimu lating an inhibitory center, or about an inhibitory center reducing activity. The initial paradox has been dissolved by finding a suitable 'immediate' cause of the effect and thereby reducing the initially paradoxical cause to the status of a 'remote' cause. The case is not unique. Scientists often find puzzling correlations, and often know in advance what would remove the puzzlement. Indeed, such knowledge guides the formation and choice of hypotheses to be tested. The initial puzzlement and repugnance need not, of course, arise from an apparent paradox. An apparent Incommensurable Cause can be almost as distressing. Admittedly, we talk easily of the straw that broke the camel's back, but we do not mean what we say. By 'the straw', we mean the last straw, or the last of many straws and thereby refer to what we all take to be the cause, namely, a load (or overload) of straw. Should anyone insist that he meant what he said, that the single straw was the cause of the camel's collapse, we would object, "But how could a single straw break the back of a beast of burden?" We would allow, of course, that a single straw, or rather a small number of straws might break the back of a camel suffering from osteoporesis, or some other decalcifying disease. But then there is nothing incommensurable about a small load and the broken, fragile back of a sick camel no longer fit to be a beast of burden. We tend to hold with the Scholastic principle of commensurability of cause and effect, a principle with several historical roots. Like tribal magicians, Aristotle held that "agent and patient must be 'like' [i.e., 51</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM RUDDICK identical] in kind", and such similarity, of course, would include magni tude.7 It is doubtful Aristotle was still laboring under the juridical view of things Kelsen ascribes to earlier Greeks. But there are other obvious charms to this principle. It allows one to think of causal influence in a literal fashion, as a flowing of cause into effect. And it favors theistic accounts of creation. If all causation is literally causal influence, then a cause must be at least as great as its effects, for a donor cannot give what it does not first possess. And what is as 'great' as the universe if not God? Whatever our reasons, we do tend to demand that an incommensurable causal diagnosis be revised, either by enlarging the cause or diminishing the effect. Such causal enlargements reduce the initially alleged cause to the status of causal factor, or of part-cause; while reductions of effect qualify the original alleged effect. In either case, the initial diagnosis is replaced, but not totally rejected. Some instances of a third repugnant cause, the Chance Cause, resemble incommensurable causes. Indeed, on Poincar?'s analysis we say that an event is due to chance in cases in which "a very small cause which escapes our notice determines a considerable effect that we cannot fail to see".8 For example, whether I win or lose at roulette is due to chance, because an effect which is for me "of the highest importance" is decided by a "variation of a thousandth or a two-thousandth in the impulse" which sets the wheel turning. Not all chance events, however, have incommensurably small causes. On Aristotle's account, an event is said to be due to chance when it has an 'incidental' cause.9 For example, a man goes for a certain purpose to a place he rarely visits, and while there accomplishes something totally unrelated to his intended mission. His going there is the chance cause of his, say, selling a ticket to a feast, for "it was only incidentally that he got his money by going there". Chance, for Aristotle, is "an incidental cause in the sphere of those actions for the sake of something which involve purpose". Being 'incidental' to its effect is a misfortune that any cause can suffer during temporary misdescription. Most causes, however, can be rede scribed in a way that makes them 'proper' to their effects, that is, makes them proper answers to specific causal questions. But causes of effects due to chance cannot, Aristotle thought, be so redeemed. They are forever incidental to their effects. The gap between, say going-in-order to-do-Z and doing-7is irreducible. 52</page><page sequence="8">CAUSAL CONNECTION Likewise, there is a gap between cause and effect in Poincar?'s roulette case. The initial increment of torque that makes the difference between winning and losing differs from the effect not only in magnitude, but in category. It is a physicist's event, while the effect is a gambler's event. We can remove these disparities of size and category if we redescribe the effect in physicists' terms. Rather than the psychologically loaded phrase 'my winning number', let us use 'small spatial interval R9 for describing the wheel's final resting place. There is nothing 'considerable' about the difference between small interval R and its neighbor, interval B. Hence there is no longer a disparity in size between a small increment of torque and the small increment of motion from B to R. And, of course, torque and motion are at home together. If, however, we retain the gambler's description of the outcome, there may be no redescription or supplementation of the initially cited cause which will remove the disparity between cause and effect. For example, beefing up the decisive increment of torque with the rest of the torque and other forces will not work. Gambling outcomes and physical forces, of whatever magnitude, remain incommensurable in category. In this respect, the torque which determines a chance success at roulette is also an instance of a fourth kind of repugnant cause, the Heterogeneous Cause. Just as philosophers have argued that chance causation is im possible, so they have claimed that psycho-physical interaction and divine interference - paradigms of heterogeneous causation - are impossible. How could something immaterial have material results? An idea might produce another idea, but how could an idea produce neural stimulation? The disparity between mind and body, or between God and the world, as they are usually conceived, has inspired materialism and idealism. To reduce mind to body or body to mind is to remove an obstacle to their interaction. Just as the roulette case could be redeemed by 'reducing' the gambler's winning number to the physical space on which his stake happened to rest, so psycho-physical interaction can be made acceptable by 'reducing' desires to neuro-muscular events. Just as torque and motion are homogeneous, so too are contractions and movements of approach or avoidance. Or, alternatively, one may try to identify limbs and goal objects with alleged mental surrogates. There is nothing incongruous about desires producing appropriate images, or, more generally, with ideas causing ideas (within limits set by, say, traditional laws of associ 53</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM RUDDICK ation).10 Similar reductive remedies of pantheism and idealism help overcome resistance to the possibility of divine interaction with the world. The four causes we undervalue - Paradoxical, Incommensurable, Chance, and Heterogeneous - and their remedies are obviously alike, indeed sufficiently alike to count them as species of a single kind, the incongruous Cause. All four lack a certain property which their various remedies supply, thereby removing their incongruity and our initial resistance. Let us call that property, congruity. It is only when a causal diagnosis provides a cause congruous with the effect in question that we are likely to give any supporting evidence its full weight. And, I suggest, that it is because the causes we overvalue - Fictitious, Spurious, and Vacuous - have this property of congruity that we are inclined to ignore any subverting evidence. They are Congruous Causes par excellence, and as such are allowed lower standards of evidence, or none at all. But why should congruity and incongruity have such influence? The answer, I think, is this. We overvalue congruous causes because, although there may be little or no evidence that they produce certain effects, they do explain those effects. And we undervalue incongruous causes because, although there may be evidence that they produce certain effects, they do not explain those effects. This answer will be plausible only after congruity has been charac terized (Section II) and shown to be a source of explanatory power (Section III).

CONGRUITY From our overvalued causes and the remedies for undervalued causes, let us compile a partial table of congruous causes and effects (see Table I). There are two features of these pairs of terms worthy of comment: (1) one term either includes the other, or could be defined or explained with the help of the other; (2) certain conjunctions formed with these pairs imply causal state ments. For example, take 'overload' and 'break'. Neither term includes the other explicitly, but an ample dictionary might well contain the following entry: overload, n. A burden greater than something can long bear under normal conditions without breaking, malfunction or failure of function. The entry for 'break', however, would not mention overloading: the terms are not mutually definable. Moreover, this pair of terms in conjunction has causal implications. Consider the following conjunctions : 1. The wire was overpriced and broke. 2. Something was placed on the wire and the wire broke. 3. The wire was overloaded and broke. Were any of those three asserted, we would suppose that the first event mentioned bore, or was believed to bear some relevance to the second. For the third conjunction, that relevance is clearly causal ; for the first, it is not causal; and for the second, it may be causal. That is, assertion of p. The wire was overloaded and broke, implies q. The overload caused the wire to break, and perhaps q'. The overload snapped the wire. I mention q', because a pair of cause and effect terms of the sort in question (i.e., 'overload' and 'break') often have one or more associated 55</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM RUDDICK transitive verbs (here, 'snap'). Depending on the objects, or events in question, the conjunction (upon assertion) may either imply (as here) or be implied by a causal judgment containing one of these associated verbs. But these associations are of less importance than the nature of the implication of q or q' by p. The implication of causation is not as strong as logical entailment. If p entails q, p must be false if q is false. But it may be false that an overload caused the wire to break and yet true that the wire was overloaded and broke. If I say, "The wire was overloaded and broke, but the overload was not the cause", what I report may call for an explanation and perhaps I must have one in hand if I am justified in saying what I said. But what ever my remark invites or needs for justification, it makes perfectly clear sense. H. P. Grice has introduced a notion of implication weaker than entail ment which is useful here.11 It is not the conjunction which implies a causal statement, but rather the assertion of the conjunction which implies (or 'implicates') a causal statement. As we have already seen, this implication (or 'implicature') is subject to 'cancellation'. That is, the speaker can explicitly cancel the causal implication of his assertion of the conjunction without thereby cancelling, or withdrawing his assertion. Were the con junction itself, rather than its assertion, the vehicle of implication, such cancellation would not be possible. These implications of causal connection also have what Grice calls a high degree of 'nondetachability'. That is, most other ways of saying the same thing carry the same causal implication. For example, the causal implication of asserting "The wire was overloaded and broke" is not detached by asserting instead, "The wire was overloaded, then broke", or, "Overloaded, the wire broke", or "The wire broke: it was overloaded". This last sentence is not to be confused with "The wire broke and was overloaded". Although the sentences are superficially equivalent by truth-functional criteria, asserting "The wire broke: it was overloaded" implies that overloading was the cause of the break, while asserting "The wire broke and was overloaded" implies that the break was an occasion, or reason for overloading the wire. This last conjunction reverses the original order of the conjuncts. Since by truth-functional criteria, conjunctions of the forms 'p and q9 and 'q and p9 say the same thing, reversing the conjuncts is at least one way of 56</page><page sequence="12">CAUSAL CONNECTION detaching the causal implication of the original conjunction. Another method of detachment is the truth-functionally innocuous replacement of 'and' by 'but'. Asserting "The wire was overloaded but broke" implies (if anything) that the wire broke in spite of its overload. That this is implied, however, is doubtful, for its very sense is doubtful. That an overload would tend to prevent, rather than to produce breakdown verges on nonsense. Of course, 'but' or some other contrastive ('yet', nevertheless') is permissible when an overload is not accompanied by a break. Indeed, a contrastive is needed if we do not wish to surprise and mystify our hearers. A contrastive signals a discontinuity: it warns the hearer that what is to follow is not what he has been led to expect. Asserting "The wire was overloaded" raises expectations of malfunction. If those expec tations are to be dashed, then a speaker who wishes to make his remarks unarresting had best introduce surprising news of normal functioning by 'but'. He will thereby prepare his hearer and show that he realizes that a conjunction as odd as that of overload and normal function cannot pass without explanation. It may be supposed that these several expectations, oddities, and impli cations derive from common knowledge of first- or second-hand experi enced regularities. We have learned directly or indirectly that overloaded wires break: hence the facts about assertable and unassertable con junctions and contrastives noted above. But glib appeal to learning and experience is not as convincing as it once was. Nor should it be here. Few philosophers, even few philosophers of science have had great experience of wires. And yet we are certain of some general truths connecting overloaded wires and breaks. But what exactly are those truths? I, for one, do not know for certain that all or most overloaded wires break. It may well be the case that many wire-users are sufficiently knowledgeable and careful to take compensating pre cautions whenever they overload a wire. They may relieve other strains on an overloaded wire, or allow an overload for only short periods. But without knowing whether or not they do, I know that overloading in creases the probability of breaking, and hence makes compensa tions desirable or imperative. And I know for certain, whatever the actual frequency of breaks occurring or allowed, that overloads cause breaks. 57</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM RUDDICK It may be said that my scant experience of wires is amply supplemented by knowledge drawn from experience of similar things like ropes or threads. As a reader of philosophy of science, I have for example been told on the highest authority that there is a well-tested "hypothesis of the character of a natural law" to the effect that, Whenever a thread is loaded with a weight exceeding that which characterizes the tensile strength of the thread, then it will break.12 But if such a law is a source of my confidence in my general claims about wires, empiricists can take little satisfaction. Since tensile strength is definable as "the greatest longitudinal stress a substance can bear without tearing asunder", the 'strict universality' (and truth) of this 'hypothesis' is derivable from meanings, as well as from cases. My initial less general claims about overloaded wires have a similar linguistic, or semantic defense. Should someone seem to question either "Overloading increases the probability of a wire breaking" or "Over loading causes wires to break", we would suspect him of ignorance of at least some of the relevant English words and would very likely cite some thing like the ample definition of 'overload' given above. These claims, however, are not simple tautologies. If we could take a challenge to such platitudes seriously, we could defend them by per forming a simple demonstration with a wire and a weight. Although in no sense an experiment, such a demonstration is an appeal to experience, and as such would provide an empirical defense for claims that would more usually be defended semantically. These causal and probability claims, then, are doubly defensible. Verificationists would, of course, object that claims so variously de fensible must be ambiguous. If they seem to have both empirical and semantic defenses, that can only be due to their harboring both tautologies and generalizations under a single verbal cover. I grant that suitable qualifications can drive unqualified causal and probability statements into tautologies, thereby depriving them of empiri cal support, and other suitable qualifications can turn them into generali zations, thereby denying them of semantic, or conceptual support. For example, adding features of my definition of 'overload' produces the tautologies, "Under normal conditions, uncompensated overloads eventu ally cause breaks or breakdown", and "Under normal conditions, uncom pensated overloads increase the probability of eventual breaking or break 58</page><page sequence="14">CAUSAL CONNECTION down". Likewise, adding frequency qualifications will produce the frank empirical generalizations, "Overloading often causes breaks or break down" and "Overloads usually increase the probability of breaks or breakdown". But the results of such additions do not show the ambiguity of the initial, unqualified claims. Nor do they show that those claims are vague or imprecise: unqualified generality is not identical with vagueness, nor qualifying with making precise. Nor do these derivative tautologies and generalizations commit me to counting the parent propositions as hover ing between, let alone falling into, both the Analytic and the Synthetic baskets. I have avoided these disputed labels, for they have at least temporarily lost their philosophic usefulness. But if forced to use the labels, I would count the unqualified causal and probability claims as synthetic - on two conditions : namely, that (1) 'synthetic' is taken to mean no more than 'non-analytic'; and (2) 'analytic' is taken to mean (? la Frege) 'defensible only by meanings alone'. Calling them synthetic is, however, not merely useless. It is misleading, for it is the semantic support for such claims that is usually neglected. Even philosophers most committed to Hume and extensional logic give as paradigms of empirical laws truisms whose appeal is not simply the familiarity of supporting correlations.13 Why I have dwelt on these 'causal generalities' will become clearer in my subsequent remarks on explanation. Their immediate relevance is simply this : they add to the evidence that congruity is a semantic relation. The pairs of terms listed in Table I (p. 54) are such that one member may be used to define, or at least explain the other. In addition we see that lying behind the causal implications, expectations, and oddities associated with conjunctions formed of these pairs are causal generalities which have a linguistic, or semantic defense. That congruity is a semantic relation is of some importance if, as I believe, congruity is a principal source of the explanatory power of events. But before examining congruity and explanation, I shall mention a few more characteristics and examples of congruity. Congruity is a dyadic relation between descriptions of events, objects, states, or pro cesses. And it is a symmetric, but ordered relation. The first member of 59</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM RUDDICK the pair often marks an event beginning earlier than that marked by the second, as with the congruous pairs, 'asks for' and 'is given', or 'needs' and 'receives'. But only at the momentary outset does pushing against, or pulling at an object precede its motion. When 'pushing against' and 'moving' are used of concurrent events, there is no question as to which is the first, or causal term. Congruity is not a biunique relation. ('Moves', for example, is congru ous with various verbs of force.) Nor is it a transitive relation. ('Press upon' is congruous with 'crush'; 'crush', with 'break' and 'break' with 'make useless'. But 'press upon' is not congruous with 'make useless'.) Nor is congruity a reflexive relation: a term is not congruous with itself. This follows from the facts that only one of two congruous terms is definable or explicable with the help of the other and no term can explain itself. Nor can a grammatically active term explain its passive cognate. To understand either 'pushing' or 'being pushed', a person must under stand the other. Hence, neither term is available for explaining the other. Likewise, for correlative terms like 'giving' and 'receiving', or 'searching' and 'finding'. Unlike these correlative pairs, one term of a congruous pair may be understood without the other and thus will be available for explaining the other. I do not pretend to have given a list of properties which can be used for identifying further congruous pairs. The notion of one term helping to define or explain the other is too vague to allow this list such a use. My concern here is merely to sketch a relation which holds between what are cause- and effect-terms when they describe two events or objects, and to show that relation to be semantic. So much is enough to give sense to the thesis of the next section, namely, congruity, a semantic relation between descriptive terms, is a principal source of explanatory power. III. EXPLANATORY POWER What is the source of an event's explanatory power? The usual answer is : covering laws of appropriate form. Laws of the forms, (x)(Fx^&gt;Gx) and prob (G\F)?n (where n is near 1) confer on an event whose description has the form Fa the power to explain an event whose description has the form Ga. Various counter-examples have shown that this formal, or syntactical condition does not insure explanatory power.14 Perhaps further conditions, formal and otherwise, can dismiss these counter-examples. 60</page><page sequence="16">CAUSAL CONNECTION But, whether sufficient with or without emendation, coverage by laws of the above standard forms does not seem necessary for explanatory power. If any general proposition is needed to enable one event to explain another, it need not, I think, be either a universal generalization or a probability statement. Something 'looser' will do, namely, what in the last section I called 'generalities'. Examples are the causal generality "Overloads cause breakdown" and the related probability generality "Overloads increase the probability of breakdown". Since the latter states an increased probability, not a high probability, there is no tempta tion to make it fit the form, prob (G\F) = n, where n is close to 1. The causal generality, however, might seem to be elliptical for "Overloads always cause breakdown", and thereby lend itself to representation by (x)(Fx=&gt;Gx). Even if a universal causal claim were adequately representable by this formula, the causal generality cannot be so represented for, as we have seen, it is not a universal claim. It is true that overloads cause breakdown, but false that they always, or even usually do. Why has it seemed plausible that universal truths are necessary for explanatory power? Perhaps one set of connected assumptions is this: only a cause explains its effect; a cause is a sufficient condition for the occurrence of its effect; only laws can insure sufficiency; hence, laws are necessary if an effect is to be explained. John Stuart Mill, for one, held such a view. To insure that a cause was sufficient for its effect, he had to make a cause indefinitely complex: The cause ... philosophically speaking, is the sum total of the conditions positive and negative taken together; the whole of the contingencies of every description, which being realized, the consequent invariably follows.15 He noted, however, certain vulgar prejudices which kept us from admitting this complexity. We are so struck by a condition which is 'productive', or which immediately precedes the effect, that we single it out from among the innumerably many conditions which compose the cause (philosophically speaking). We especially favor immediately pre ceding conditions as 'the cause' (commonly speaking). Thus, we take as the cause of a camp being attacked by surprise the absence of the sentinel - a mere 'absence of preventing causes' - instead of a 'producing cause' such as a bribe, or the fatigue which put the soldiers to sleep, or the events 61</page><page sequence="17">WILLIAM RUDDICK that led to mobilization of the attacking force. And rather than the solid, indisputable earth, we take as the cause of falling bodies the 'logical fiction' of a force, or attraction exerted by the earth. These 'abstractions', unlike the earth itself, can be represented as "exhausted by each effort, and therefore constituting at each successive instant a fresh fact, simul taneous with or only immediately preceding the effect". Mill has our preferences right, but our reasons wrong. It is not a de mand for a temporally proximate cause that leads to the 'invention' of forces of attraction. As a fact of theory, forces are not conceived as a succession of 'exhausted efforts' each being simultaneous with or only immediately preceding an effect. But even if they were so conceived, it would be their congruity with their effects, rather than their temporal proximity that would make them preferable to the earth tout court as the cause of the falling of bodies toward the earth. As vacuous causes show, the relation between a force and its appropriate effect is an especially appealing case of congruity. Our preference for the sentinel's absence is also due to congruity with, not to its temporal proximity to, the surprise capture. Even if one of the 'productive events' that put the soldiers to sleep (say, their fatigue) had overcome them just before the attack, we should still prefer as the cause the sentinel's absence. As conditions sine quibus non, the fatigue and the sentinel's absence are on a par. The camp would not have been taken by surprise if either the soldiers were awake and alert or the sentinel had been at his post. But as candidate for the cause of the surprise capture, the sentinel's absence is superior. The soldiers' fatigue causes, or creates the need for a sentinel to stand guard while the soldiers sleep. It is the senti nel's absence, that is, his failure to stand guard that causes, or allows the camp to be taken by surprise. It may seem that the sentinel's absence is preferred because it, rather than the fatigue, is abnormal or is a deviation from routine. But suppose there had been no war and no apparent threat of war prior to the attack, and suppose that sentinels were often off their posts. In what sense was the sentinel's absence on the fatal night abnormal? Only I think, in the sense that the sentinel was not doing what by definition he was meant to do, namely, guarding against the very kind of surprise that took place. Or, in my jargon, the pair 'sentinel' and 'guarding from surprise', and hence the pair 'absent sentinel' and 'taken by surprise' are congruous 62</page><page sequence="18">CAUSAL CONNECTION pairs. By contrast, 'fatigue' and 'taken by surprise' are not. Our preference is for the causal factor congruous with the effect. And we can recognize that factor without knowledge of 'strictly universal' laws, or indeed any laws at all. In their concern to exclude untestable, non-empirical explanations, empiricists have made expla nation seem an unachievable ideal. To explain fully, say, the cracking of a car radiator, Hempel would require us to complete a long list of scien tific laws which he has only begun.16 But, I suggest, only one general truth (if any) is needed to explain fully the famous case, namely, "Internal pres sure bursts inflexible containers." Of course, for this generality to apply, it must also be true that the metal of which the radiator is made be inflexible and that the fluid with which it is filled be able to exert internal pressure. And to know why the radiator cracked when it did (on a cold night), we would have to know that the radiator contents expand, and thereby exert internal pressure, upon freezing. But this additional information merely justifies subsuming the case in question under the causal general ity, "Internal pressure bursts inflexible containers." It is the generality so applied that confers explanatory power on the freezing water. And ulti mately it is the semantic connection between 'expansive pressure' and 'bursting' that gives this generality the power it confers, for this general ity expresses that connection. It does not establish it. The ability to understand the cracking of the radiator is, I claim, enjoyed by anyone who knows the relevant bits of English (or some equivalent). The ability to predict the cracking is, of course, not so widely shared. Since Hume, predictability and explicability have been closely associated. Hume's demands on any impression which would legitimate the concept of power are demands for both inevitability (hence predicta bility) and intelligibility. For him, an impression of power (or, necessary connection) would have to reveal (1) what effect that power will always produce, (2) why it has that effect and no other, and (3) why it must have that effect and can have no other. Hempel's thesis that explanation and prediction are 'symmetrical', that is, that the source of explanatory power is the source of predictive power, is the refined version of Hume's conflation of intelligibility and inevitability (or conditional necessity). But to know, given certain conditions, what event will occur and when 63</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAM RUDDICK is not the same as knowing, given those same conditions, why that event and no other has occurred. To say what the latter does involve is, of course, not easy. But certain metaphors and analogies are helpful, especially in the light of what has been said about commensurability and congruity. In expressing dissatisfaction with psycho-physical interaction, Sherrington speaks of the absence of 'a hint' of the cause in the alleged effect: ... there follows on, or attends, the stage of brain-cortex reaction an event or set of events quite inexplicable to us, which both as to themselves and as to the causal tie between them and what preceded them science does not help us ; a set of events seemingly incommensurable with any of the events leading up to it. The self 'sees' the sun; ... in the sequence of events a step is reached where a physical situation in the brain leads to a psychical, which however contains no hint of the brain or of any other bodily part.17 And Santayana put equally well what we want. People expect to have an insight into causal connections, such as they have in action, or in answer to a prayer, or obedience to an order given or the execution of a plan.18 Or, at least they did so expect, Santayana thought, until Hume freed them from such vain hopes. I think we still have such expectations, and that they are both legitimate and satisfiable. That insight which involves the 'hint' of the cause in the effect is found when cause and effect are congruous. At least some of Hume's demands for a notion of causal connections can be met, namely, those for clear examples of intelligible causal connec tions. And a congruity does not satisfy Hume's demands for examples of inevitable causal connections, congruity does give rise to certain qualified inferences about future and past unknown cases. For example, if some thing is overloaded and no compensating precautions are taken, then failure of function is more probable and will eventually occur. And if something has broken while overloaded, then the overload is a probable cause. It was Hume's phenomenalism and his preoccupation with visual properties that insured his failure to find anything resembling the causal connections he pretended to seek. Whenever Hume wished to show that nothing could be inferred about the character of an effect from its cause, he tended to describe the cause solely in visual terms. Thus, the cause of a second billiard ball moving from rest was said to be the "approach and 64</page><page sequence="20">CAUSAL CONNECTION touch", or "contact" of another ball.19 And for Hume's Adam, an animal falling into "a fluid, transparent substance",20 and a flame consuming paper is a mere "bright, flickering" object. It is not surprising Hume despaired of finding causal connections which were nothing more than our projected expectations of familiar consequents. Visual properties do not tend to explain other physical properties, or as I put it, visual terms are not congruous with other physical terms.21 At times, however, Hume did count as the cause of a ball's moving from rest the shock, or impact of another ball. Is it obvious that nothing about the effect, or likely effect can be inferred from such dynamical, non-visual descriptions of the cause? Only someone indiffer ent, or insensitive to causal language could treat 'impact' and 'touch' as equivalent descriptions of the same event. Except for Aristotle and certain Idealists22, philosophers have been in different and insensitive to our causal language. In my efforts to correct these lapses, I have no doubt given the impression that I take what we say, rather than what happens to be the explanation of natural and social phenomena. I do not wish to deny a distinction between events and their descriptions, however vexed that distinction may be. But causal explana tion is closely tied, as Aristotle saw, to the answering of questions. And it can be argued (but not here) that questions, by virtue of their meaning, delimit what will count as an answer and what will count as a good an swer.23 Accordingly, it is neither paradoxical nor merely modish to claim that causal explanation involves congruity, a meaning-relation between the terms which describe a cause and the effects it explains. It is not our expectations, but our language that is the source of what ever 'causal connections' we project into nature. And far from being the mysterious connections empiricists allege, those causal connections are as intelligible as the meaning-connections they reflect.

For this law, Popper substi tutes two non-tautologous laws in a footnote. But explanatory power is not thereby increased. That power resides in the notion of an exceeded breaking point. But I am anticipating Section III below. 13 Consider these 'empirical generalizations' : 'Blows cause injuries.' (Hart and Honore) 'Fragile things tend to break when struck hard enough, other conditions being right.' (D. Davidson) 'Flames are hot and cause melting.' (Hume) 'When hard particles of steel are in immediate contact with soft particles of bone, the latter give way.' (Schlick) 'Insults cause anger.' (Nagel) 'Whenever the sun (or some other luminous body) is above the horizon, and its rays travel in straight lines, and there is no opaque body in a straight line between that luminous body and the part of the earth where we are situated, then it is day there.' (J. S. Mill) These are hardly statements of observed correlations. Like Popper's law about threads and mine about overloads, these 'familiar truths' are, I suggest, doubly defensible by both dictionaries and demonstrations. (Davidson's law is perhaps qualified to the point of tautology and has only dictionary defense.) 14 For counter-examples to the Popper-Hempel models of explanation, see, for exam ple, S.
