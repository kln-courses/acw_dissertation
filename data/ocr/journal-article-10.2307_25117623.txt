Paul Shepard ANIMAL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RITES A progressive march of civil justice over the past two centuries is the historic setting within which blacks, women, and lately 18-year-olds, have been in part ele vated in political power and social status. Whole nations and economic classes composing a "third world", usually identified by a non-industrial economy, are now popu larly regarded as unjustly deprived. The implication seems to be that powerful nations are economically obli gated to satisfy the right to be rich and, implicitly, to be free. Meanwhile the egalitarian flood reached out to orphans, working children, infants, idiots, and cripples. Then, with the humanitarian movement of the last cen tury spilling over, it came to the protection of domestic animals ? a kind of 4th world ? invoking in their name the right not to be overworked, tortured or abandoned. The movement for the rights of animals and plants would seem, therefore, to be an extension of legal means of civilization. The question is now whether the further ing of an ethical relationship to animals can indeed come as an extension of the idea of human rights. Is a civil and legal foundation derived from several millennia of purely human politics a sound basis for ecological jus tice? If not, what is the context of such an ethic? Today's concern for the well-being of animals in zoos and medical laboratories is a further unfolding of the defense of homeless dogs and cats. It is typical of this protective attitude toward animals to be yoked to the theme of poor housing: the condition of caged animals, and finding homes for strays. There is something about the "homelessness" of wild animals that obsesses humani tarians. For them a bird's nest is obviously its home and even a hole in the ground is better than no roof over one's head. This fixation on shelter plays into the hands of such enterprises as the logging and paper in dustries whose re-seeding of the plains of their disasters is publicly described as "creating a home" for wildlife. Like anti-litter and beautification themes, such propa gandist lullabies are the tunes to which protective asso ciations find themselves swaying if not dancing. It also has an Oriental expression, a logic by which rights of creatures, so frustrating in their semantic and practical aspects, can be serenely refined to the purity of non-killing. A recent exponent of this view was Albert Schweitzer, who, combining St. Augustine with Hindu Jainism, was devoted to the protection from death or injury of all life however minute or inconspicuous.1 Schweitzer's "reverence for life" was an endless chain of excruciating decisions in all things medical and horti cultural. His unshakable conviction of the rights of life over death and of the priority of human value did not mitigate his somber sense of judgement and responsi bility. For him, too, the care of life was associated with giving shelter. He kept captive a small menagerie of wild 1 See Albert Schweitzer, Philosophy of Civilization, Vol. 2, Civilization and Ethics (London: Black, 1923) ; Out of My Life and Thought (New York: Holt, 1933). Also, The Animal World of Albert Schweitzer, ed. and tr. C. R. Joy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1951), THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974 35</page><page sequence="2">animals so that he could admire them. As among all wild captives made into pets, these animals were amputated from their gene pool, and from fellow creatures and habitat; no amount of loving care could prevent them from becoming neurotic and flabby monsters. Schweitzer's impulse to "extend to all life that respect which we have for our own," however much * influenced by Eastern thought, is clearly related to Western humani tarian social justice. It was a part of the colonial mind, a kind of obligation to those "less forturfate" in a scale where rank is confirmed as much by responsibility as privilege. Charity has always had something of the read iness to be resigned to a status quo. That the relationship between non-human species should require human inter vention, though as old as the "dominion" precepts in Genesis, could only be acted upon by those who knew themselves to be the instruments of God's will. Even so, Schweitzer is no exception to the general sense of alie nation that preoccupied European philosophy and liter ature at the time, for it was a strategy in which humanism and technology combined to prove human transcendence. Like all ideologies, this attitude could perceive eco logical conflict as an uncompromising Us or Them. The consequences are either exile or sanctuary. As. any natu ralist knows, there is a widespread general assumption that any wild creature which is no longer found here has simply gone somewhere else. The popular discovery of the migration of birds had the unfortunate effect of seeming to support the notion of a kind of infinite mo bility. It took half a century to convince duck hunters that the ducks which no longer came south no longer existed. The concept of sanctuary is more interesting, for it is no mere illusion. It is the only humanitarian "solution" available to the ideological imagination. The American Indian and the American bison thus went onto reserva tions at the same time. The idea has the merit that it recognizes the multiplicity of factors necessary for life and treats survival as populations instead of individuals. Continued existence demands a space, geography, or habi tat, which cannot be fully described and is not known. We now have whooping crane sanctuaries, condor sanc tuaries, black-footed ferret sanctuaries. In New Zealand I have seen a frog sanctuary, all the known individuals of which live on a single rocky ridge no bigger than a football field. Most such protected space is "set aside" for relic populations of certain endangered species. Reservations are a kind of reprieve for those creatures whose range and number have so shrunk that they are in danger of becoming extinct, a last minute commutation from a death sentence to a life term. Or, in a political idiom, we may imagine all survivors of such minorities transplanted to a new state. Sanctuaries are also likened to museums established by patronizing largesse for the edification and amusement of visitors. The example of the sanctuary for frogs points up the inevitable problem in a world of two million species. Scores of species of molluscs and freshwater fish are either endangered or already extinct. The TVA alone accounted for several species of snails. No one knows of these ? or cares ? except a few naturalists. It is obvi ously impossible to establish a sanctuary for every crea ture which must soon face that ultimate ideological mo ment. Such will not be necessary. The humanitarian jury has an ancient Chain of Being etched in its conscience* "Worthy" species can thus be chosen, and it is not likely that we will go much "below" frogs. If the theme of sanctuary were actually followed to its logical end, with every endangered species in turn granted its own reservation, the spaces would gradually coalesce until the whole planet was a sanctuary. Not a bad idea, perhaps. But this cannot happen because the concept is a political solution to 19th century problems when space was still unlimited. In evolutionary terms this unfeasible arrangement could be described as allopatric ? the simultaneous life of potentially conflicting species by geographic separation. Extinction, exile (as extirpation), and sanctuary are the allopatric choices in man's cohabi tation of the earth with other life. Allopatry is consistent with our traditions of personal property, the model of the nation state, the philosophy of the domination of nature, and even with industrial growthmania up to a point. The alternative is sympatry, or living together. One form is captivity for the non human, which is an indirect form of its destruction as a species. We are nearly without the cultural rudiments of an ecological ethic based on sympatry. Only the Peace able Kingdom offers an image of that halcyon state. Un fortunately it refers to no creatures that we know. Al though depicted with the outlines of lions and iambs, the 36 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974</page><page sequence="3">Animal Rights and Human Rites inhabitants of that mythical garden have no other resem blance to life. There are some unchosen sympatric symbiotic forms. The dooryard birds, weeds of the lawn, roaches, fleas, house mice ? a few dozen stowaways in the wheelhouses and holds of spaceship earth. It is a sparse fauna and flora, to which the pests and diseases of mankind may be added as species in their own rieht. Though wild in the true genetic sense in which domesticates are not, they are relatively unimportant to the larger question. That both vegetarian and other ethical non-killing philosophies are exercised primarily on these urban fellow travellers and domesticated animals is indicative of the irrelevance of the creatures and the practices. Extinction has almost nothing to do with direct killing (with some exceptions, such as whales). The preoccupation with not killing houseflies is like a narcotic. Whole realms of life are swept away while devotees bicker over the sanitation of zoos and zealots gingerly move each ant from the side walk. It is almost as though some devil had provided this homely assembly of houseflies and milk goats to divert us. Our society has hardly begun to address the question of sharing the land with competitors, predators, parasites, and with those forms so little threatening and so fragile that special care is needed to prevent their inadvertent destruction. The scientific evidence, good as it is, cannot guide us to economic decisions affecting all daily con tacts with a million species or with the environments on which they depend. The situation is illustrated by the self-serving argument of chemical pesticide industries against restrictions: "Get all the evidence before you make a decision." ? a provision that would postpone regulation indefinitely. For the same reason ? that we do not know all the details of all the niches of all crea tures ? the concept of rights (at least as conventionally conceived) cannot be applied. We do not in fact know what must be done to assure the most elementary right of survival of more than a few hundred species. Something much more pragmatic than economics or quasi-political rights is called for: procedures which keep our connectedness with all life before us, even though we don't know how the connections work. Indeed, certain universal elements of ecological systems might be taken as representing the whole. I have in mind food chains. In contrast to the ethical-humanitarian canon of no killing, the food chain or trophic-ecological approach would be to emphasize the centrality of pr?dation. The humanitarian's projection onto nature of illegal murder and the rights of civilized people to safety not only misses the point but is exactly contrary to fundamental ecological reality: the structure of nature is a sequence of killings. Part of the "moral" difficulty of accepting this criterion is that it is overlaid with the overwhelming fact of the murder of some seventy million people between 1913 and 1946. The notion of deliberately linking such a dan gerous "blood lust" into an active philosophy of nature must surely on its surface seem monstrous. There will be no alternative but to begin at the beginning, to ex amine the nature of war as part of the politics of the members of a single species and the nature of pr?dation as a wholly different matter. The Cynegetic Sensibility llave men ever lived by a code of interspecies killing who do not kill one another? If so ? and I believe that the evidence is strong for such peoples, both in our past and among living hunter-gatherers ? what can it signify for us? Admittedly, at this point it can do no more than to signal a hopeful surface. We must unravel the so called "primitive" one step at a time, peeling back the alternate layers of anthropological fact and cultural lies, hoping that illumination from a time and a way of life to which we cannot literally return will shine upon us. Not only are war and murder rare, but among those killers of animals, whose lives were a perpetual celebra tion of food chains, there was and is disinclination to maximize. The jaw of the economist in us falls open; here were and are people who did not take more when there was more for the taking. No wonder the 19th cen tury regarded the "savage" as having a "lack of drive", "deficient intelligence", or "physical apathy". It was as incomprehensible as the notion that such low matters as killing and eating can be close to the center of any kind of ethical system. Apprehension of connectedness to nature is precisely the weakness of Western ethics. Marriage and diet are the universal means and symbols of relationship. It is just in the matter of food chains in nature that the THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974 37</page><page sequence="4">cynegetic (hunting/gathering) mind excels. For us, ani mals in general constitute a vague Other; we are re minded throughout our lives of the many distinctions between us and them. It is extremely difficult to recast that whole assumption, to break out of our own culture by an act of will, to see the others as a myriad of beings, the differences among which are on a plane with the dif ferences between us and any one kind of them. In the cynegetic view the world is an exquisitely elaborated comity laced through with eating habits, the most con spicuous and important threads of connection and signi ficance. When one senses, however momentarily, that experience of a world of beings which it produces, the loneliness of modern men can be seen as an ecological as much as a social phenomenon. No one could be lonely in a world so richly populated. For hunters, that tapestry is a hieroglyph in which the patterns of eater and eaten are the principal figures. The terms of this communication are species, and the grammar their habits. The extensive knowledge among hunting peoples the world around has astonished ethno logists for generations. That the Fang of the Gabon, the Hanunoo of the Philippines, the San of the Kalihari, and dozens of other peoples have plant and animal taxonomies numbering in the hundreds and even thousands was merely one of those irrelevant (or merely "practical") but irritatingly ubiquitous facts until this knowledge was related to 1) the individual development of cognition, and 2) the mosaic reference for totemic metaphor by way of an accompanying natural history. "The diversity of species furnishes man with the most intuitive picture at his disposal and constitutes the most direct manifes tation he can perceive of the ultimate discontinuity of reality," comments Le vi- Strauss.2 But the infinite dis continuity is not a fragmentation, because of the natural history; the myriad forms are connected up by food chains, learned as the nomenclature is learned. Only continuity as patterns of a flow relationship save the necessary refinement of perception from becoming a nightmare of pulverized otherness. That we academics today scorn the memorizing of names reflects our culture's contempt for nature. As Vic tor Shelford and other fathers of American ecology discovered in the nineteen-twenties, the study of the dynamic life of natural communities had to wait on in ventory and recognition. Even among the sciences tax onomy is a poor relative. Every high school boy inter ested in wildlife recognizes electronic apparatus and fast vehicles as the symbols of truly chic research. The use of the food chain as an instrument in the perception of creature-rights in sympatric existence grows from the evolution of human thought. Such is the evi dence of anthropology. But to bring the food chain into the sphere of every human experience as the language of relatedness requires a more explicit and personal poetry, the precisely honed metaphors of ritual ceremony. 2 Claude Levi-Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966), p. 137. Joseph Campbell suggests that the only effective rituals are those that refer to something homologous in each individual infancy.3 In this case the primordial associa tion is with oral nutrition. In suckling, we mammals pre pare a vision of the world. The point is that to describe food chains verbally is ineffective; one must use a deeper language. That ritual ceremony has deeper roots than speech is evident in its universality. Its very use by us is a sign of continuity with nature. Among vertebrate animals the important infor mation is communicated in stereotyped, unequivocal signs derived by "stylization" from some basic care-giving be havior. Thus is a drinking posture ritualized by gulls to affirm a pair-bond or the exaggerated yawn of the baboon as a threat. Such signals are always communicative, species-specific, given in context, innate, and often in tandem or cybernetic arrangements. They range from momentary displays of bright feathers to extended human religious ceremonies, a continuum that seems objection able only to those committed to doctrines of separatism. The whole range of ritual from courtship in birds to Renaissance art was surveyed under the aegis of the Royal Society of London in 1956. Since then, ethological work, studies of human behavior, and the psychological study of art ? particularly Franco-Cantabrian cave painting ? support the unifying thrust of that symposium under Julian Huxley's leadership.4 Although we can never know what ceremonies were held in the paleolithic caves of Southern Europe twenty thousand years ago, there is a substantial argument that the game mammals portrayed were perceived in a meta phor of human dimorphism, and that the painted forms on the naturally rounded surfaces functioned as transi tional objects in the psychiatric sense of forms inter mediate between self and not-self. They are formulations of trophic status transformed by the philosophy of a great Magdalenian culture. Only beings which have a place in a coherent creation can have rights. Ultimate questions of personal and species identity turn not only on the question of what one eats or is eaten by, but upon the silent wisdom that unity is achieved by the specific eating of kinds and parts, a merger of natures and mutual assimilation thrown into relief by that which is not eaten and by the anastamosing of the one food chain with the many. If the indigent state of taxonomy shows the low regard of the insular human intellectual community for the gnosis of kind and category, the secular meal must be its public counterpart. Might saying grace have ecological consequences? Indeed, it may be impossible to overestimate the achieve* ment of interspecies ethics that would follow a renewal of ceremony at table. In a single generation there might come into existence a society imbued with the joyful solemnity of assimilation as children and weaned on its 3 Joseph Cambell, The Masks of God, Vol. 1, Primitive Myth ology (New York: Viking, 1959). 4 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, B 251, 1956. 38 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974</page><page sequence="5">Animal Rights and Human Rites sacred meaning in adolescence. The implications would carry beyond the particular organisms consumed, since the homologizing nature of ritual would spread sanctity across the whole of life. This would fly directly into the face of the humani tarian impulse. Instead of turning from death ? and therefore from life ? dietary ritual explicates the rights of animals in the why and by whom they are killed and eaten. In its absence, consider the middle class meal in which children are normally unreflective Or conditioned to be silent regarding the death on the plate before them and who, when reminded of it, react out of repugnance for all things bloody and organic, by which a fastidious society has trained them to deny the sensuous spirituality of living tissue, or they indulge in the sentimental tan trums which prevent the human heart from childhood to senility from truly loving the Other. Only from the right to die and be eaten properly, in the proper and acknow ledged food chain, can the right to life for all creatures become apparent. Albert Schweitzer's "reverence for life" seems an ap propriate term for this. But for him there was no room for pr?dation at all. He remarked that it was a perpetual sorrow that life feeds on life. He could not break out of a two-thousand-year tradition in which the loss of paradise was associated with the daimonic metaphor of the apple of paradise ? the coupling of eating and sexu ality which is a central image of venatic thought. It is not surprising that two thousand years of this denial of life produced civilizations in which all eating is regarded as merely bodily and sensual instead of sacred, guilt is a perpetual side-dish, and every animal stands pre-judged for all time. Of course this paints an incomplete picture of our society. Communion is a Christian rite of assimilation by eating and drinking. If ecologically it seems like holy cannibalism, it at least retains the potential forms for an interspecies ceremony. Meal-time grace is still widely observed. Even if it thanks an abstract provider instead of the creatures eaten, it at least calls attention to an obligation and keeps alive nutritional hierophanies. Gratitude for the meal is only a beginning. Before it comes the cooking, butchering or preparation, killing or finding. Among the living peoples for whom the sacred and profane are not sealed off from each other, every stage in the food quest carries on its back some special observations and protocol. It remains to be discovered whether children have critical period requirements in these activities. Is witness to butchering-before-ealing, for example, an irreplaceable event in the life of a five year-old by which the articulation of one's own insides is achieved? If so, butchering is an "educational" event in the organization of internal reality and perhaps even an archetype of a larger reality. As any coroner, surgeon, or anatomist knows, what is revealed in dissection is not simply a standard suit of entrail underwear, like the parts of a certain kind of automobile. What can be learned is never complete, as every individual is a departure in detail from a basic schema. Besides its candidacy for rites of assimilation, every corpse is an omen. Its anatomical eccentricities are surprises which signify on several levels. A liver is a message about the quality of food and drink antecedent in the food chains and therefore the quality of the soil which supports them. In addition to these causal connec tions, the organs flesh out possible shifts in the social entities to which they are analogous and seem to bear oracular power. Every animal to be eaten is first a mes sage which we ignore at our peril, its language garbled where animals are domesticated, and denied to modern urban children. The words "sacred", "sanctity", and "spirituality" have been used in these remarks related to the trophic apparatus of human ecology. The poetry of the food chain and its mythic potentiality are better perceived in reli gious than legal terms. The rights of men in society can be articulated and are understood to be social and politi cal creations, even though they are thought to incarnate something intrinsic. But the rights of non-human forms are their behavior. Since there is no^ alternative except death, "right" is synonymous with their continued exis tence. When non-human rights are dealt with directly in the courts a farcical parody of justice occurs ? as in the 14th century when roosters and donkeys were burned at the stake or given other punishment. Certainly humans can be constrained by legal means in their actions toward the non-human. The difficulty is that "continued exis tence" refers to a species, not to killing versus non-killing. Like Aldo Leopold's definition of conservation as "what THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974 39</page><page sequence="6">a man thinks while chopping" a tree, it is less a question of what is done than of how it is done. Zoomorphizing in the Quest for Identity x\part from food chains, there is another universal interp?n?tration with non-human life that could be evoked in the name of the whole. The emptiness of the modern human psyche is twofold: at one end the loss of identity in food chains and at the other a more immediate failure in the perception of self. If only we knew all the other creatures perfectly it would leave exactly the cognitive space for man; we would know who we are as humans without having once looked into a mirror. We are end lessly engaged in search of surcease from our inchoate ness. Throughout life we put ourselves in a kind of cosmic police lineup, now beside an oak, then beside a dolphin, then a chimpanzee. Of each we can say, "We are not this . . . and yet, there is just this that we share . . ." With each discovery we place one piece in a puzzle. Of course the process is not that conscious or delib erate. Instead we "take up the other" as a metaphoric strategy in play and language, in a drama of predication, of the suspension of disbelief while assuming another identity to find our own. Before we can be subjects to ourselves we must become objects. To think as men we must first think as non-men. To think non-men is to enact them. Does this zoomorphizing seem merely to compound 5 Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac (New York: Oxford University Press, 1948), p. 68. the error of anthropomorphizing, already so widely regretted by intellectuals? Both may have a place, but they are not co-equals. Men are zoomorphs while other creatures are not men. Zoomorphizing places us in the context that protects us from that anthropomorphism which empties the taxo nomic pyramid like a funnel and remakes the diverse forms of life in our image, Zoomorphizing connects us to the plurality of otherness. The imitation of animals by children in games of leapfrog, the investment of personality in a stuffed animal toy, the animal stories and animated films, the animal headed gods, the metaphors in language ("He is a skunk!") are more than illustrations or even analogies. By incorporating into one body the mix of self and not self the wholeness of diversity is confirmed, in the mo ment before we sort them out. The body ? the organism ? is the archetype of connectedness. In this way the process of locating ourselves bit by bit in diff?rent natures does not shatter us like glass. The metaphoric recapitulation has its own ontogeny, a progressive unfolding in each, human life. For the seven-year old playing fox-and-geese it functions differ ently than among adolescents playing on a football team called "panthers," and differently still in the caricaturing by cartoons on an editorial page. A lifetime of non human sign images stretches from them to the troubled subjectivity of the human self and group, arching through each life more or less ceremonially. It may be asked at this point whether this widespread use of animal metaphors has anything to do with the rights of animals. Is this not just another example of man's self-centered exploitation of his fellow creatures? True, we "use" animals and plants as metaphoric fillers in successive frames of reference, making them into instruments of thought and perception. But in the process they also become themselves. The effect of locating them in a cognitive framework flows both ways: self recogni tion and niche recognition. After all, the same accusation of exploitation can be directed to the eating of animals which I have already discussed. The question itself is biased by ideology. The ideological question represents the no-compromise idealism of dichotomy-choice. The biological form of that imagination is the two categories: man and animal. In that view, if rights of the non-human are simply for the non-human to be what they are, the amorphous nature of non-human amounts to no right at all. Another question may be raised as to whether the taking of animal identity by metaphoric predication actually requires natural species. James Fernandez speaks of this "primordial" predication in childhood as a stage from which a maturing ritual capacity progressively refines its transformation terms.6 He cites the ceremony of the Eucharist as an adult example. Nowhere does he explicitly say that the human capacity for liturgical rites 6 James Fernandez, "The Mission of Metaphor in Expressive Culture", Current Anthropology, 15(2) :119-146, 1974. 40 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974</page><page sequence="7">Animal Rights and Human Rites requires a childhood fixation on animals, but only that animals are conveniently ubiquitous. Even if one were to acknowledge the 'necessity of animals at some critical period in triggering the child's poetic sense, why would imaginary animals not do just as well? Moreover, the predication is not that of an animal itself but of a sign image. To momentarily take the point of view of the bull or the wolf does not require the presence of an actual bull or wolf. If the stuffed toy is a vehicle by which the culture (ransmits these sign images to the child, why not a soft furry "wook" or "gleefus"? ? not a creature from familiar nature, but a new invention for which no natural prototype is necessary and whose natural history can be equally fictitious? The question goes to the heart of the matter. It opens questions about the relation of art to nature which can not be gone into here. It bears, moreover, on the revolu tion in perception of the world by which domestication and agriculture separated themselves off from hunting/ gathering, and, as Levi-Strauss says, the model of reality was shifted from its ancient place in nature to the world of made things as totemism was replaced by caste. Still further, the question bears on the place of monsters in psychology and culture. In a study of the sculptured animals on gothic cathedrals Walter Abell made the extraordinary obser vation that there was a correlation over some 300 years of French history between the amount of social stress and the amount of stylization of the carved figures.7 He concluded that periods of tension and unrest, times of famine, plague or war coincided with abstract forms, and alternatively that social and ecological harmony was signified in naturalistic forms. Much the same thing can be seen in 19th century landscape painting. Presumably, we cannot accept a world whose purposes are inimical to our own. In good times nature can be taken at its face value, but in bad we must look to its fundamental struc ture below the visible surface for the necessary support which its externals deny. Monsters and imaginary forms are to this extent mind-creatures of desperation, emergency sign-images. In a sense no imaginary creature is possible: if we give the "gleefus" legs or a head it has some reference to the zoological realm. The virtual impossibility of imaginary beings, unfettered by natural features, suggests that the unthinkable is unthinkable because of the necessity of creature prototypes or metaphors in the genesis of human thought. Did the human mind invent the ecological niche system or is mental activity an expression of the species system ? But the question remains ? any number of objects in our environment may satisfy the resolution by meta phoric predication that relieves one more iota of our poor pronoun nebulousness. Can we not say that some of us are more like Fords and others like Oldsmobiles with some profit? 1 Walter Abell, The Collective Dream in Art (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1957), Ch. 14, No doubt such objects can serve the function, but the problem they raise has to do with content. A quick survey of the stuffed creatures in toy shops confirms an uncon scious and unarticulated consumer demand ? that the definition between kinds be kept, that identity remains important. The distinctions go far beyond the leopard's spots, extending to its behavior as well. These features are not invented; they are empirical. The ultimate ref erence is the real animal. The silent demand by children that that reference be kept sharp is evident, in the natural ism of the toys. There is a demand taxonomy implicit which is also associated with the hierarchic structure of taxonomic categories ? species, genera, families and so on. Made and fictitious objects suffer from an inevitable ambiguity of systematic relationship as well as behavior. Some of the inchoateness of our lives can never be resolved, though we are destined to continue trying. "What does it mean to be alive?" is one of those ele mental enigmas. No one outgrows such primary questions. We may leave the paradigm of the animal to small chil dren only at the risk of subscribing to the doctrine of the great chain of being, wherein the natural is lower or simpler. To the biologist, those who call machines "alive" are toying with deep semantics. The predication of the Ford or Oldsmobile, the taking of machine shape and the transient identification with it is a dangerous game to play. This is not because it threatens human dignity ? THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974 41</page><page sequence="8">an injury to our pride ? but because it displaces us from a primary task of marking out a place in a cosmos that is given and which is more terribly Other than anything we can make. Levi-Strauss is concerned with the intellectual use of natural things for the purpose of social categorization ? the formal metaphoric predications of totemism. It is but a part of the perennial need to distinguish between men and other creatures, the preoccupation in human thought with the separation of culture and nature. I mention this her? tp remind us that what has been said on the preced ing pages is not intended to support the pop-ecological theme of man's identity with nature. Pretending to be an "animal is to obtain a momentary identity for the purpose of partly breaking it. In this the two formalities ? the food chain and the predication of sign image ? have certain things in common. They both are the obtaining of a whole being to unite with it, to reject the 'inedible' while assimilating certain of its qualities. Such creatures are not arbitrarily ob tained by the individual; his culture has selected the subsystems of trophic and paradigmatic biota. Both refer to natural history and extend into the environment from mind and body through connections that are discerned in nature: to hunt is to know the habits of the hunted; to enact is to know the habits of the model. Metaphor J. he quest for the nature of the human self is linked to an information pool found in the biosphere. The infor mation content of an eco-system is related to its genetic complexity, organized into species; it is transmitted pri marily by reproduction and pr?dation. The transforma tion of this information by the human quest is largely through metaphor. This activity discerns not only sepa rate species in their uniqueness but the centrality of the food chain. Thus, for example, food exchange in nature is the archetype of exogamy ? the information flow through marrying-out that relates clans one to another. The eating ? the food chain ? is the language of mythical heroes and animals. Communications regarding status therefore involve ritual aspects of ingestion. In any specific ceremony it is right that certain things be eaten as much as that certain ones eat. Ecological study has firmly established that the well being of prey species is as much at stake as that of preda tors ?in food chain systems. The "struggle" of the indi vidual prey to elude the predator has to do with sorting out particular sets of genes for continuation, not for the escape of the prey as a species. By eating certain indi viduals and not others the predator becomes the prey's instrument for filtering the information to be transmitted to its own succeeding generations. Moreover, the hawk's "choice" of eating a rabbit instead of a mouse may be looked upon inversely as an option within the eco-system whereby part of its total information is in that instance transmitted along certain lines and not others. In these examples it cannot be asserted that the hawk "uses" the mouse or rabbit any more than the mouse uses the hawk or the ecosystem uses them both. The human use of animals as food for thought may be looked upon in the same light. After several hundred thousands of years of the cultural exercise of metaphor, who has chosen whom? Like the options in the food web not exercised on any given occasion, can we say that the natural things for which this culture has no poetic use are unimportant? Every exercise of these predications furthers a relationship. How arbitrary can a conception slowly built up in this way be? One test of validity is in the consequences in human action. Whole ecosystems may live intact or be impaired. Therefore every species in them has some stake in the outcome. If the basic acts of metaphoric predication are instinctive and unconscious then man is no more aware of what is accomplished than the animals whom he caricatures. Can we say that he "chooses" the elephant to imitate in a certain ritual any more than that the elephant has chosen to direct some of its impact on the environment via this route instead of, say, pulling up Acacia trees? Even if we grant that the elephant is indeed an arbitrary cultural choice, we cannot so easily claim that the necessity of making some choice is an optional device created out of thin air, as that is inconsistent with the evidence. The very plurality of increments in this lifetime process requires an equally complex field of reference. Indeed, the complexity of relationships that are perceived demands many more kinds of creatures, habitats, terrains and places than are incorporated in these enactments. If, as I have suggested, the continuity of these pro cesses results in both the human and non-human members having "vested interests", then what emerges is a field of relationships not unlike that of parts of the human body. Is the question, "What are the rights of my foot?" meaningful? Only to the extent that it calls attention to contiguity. Suppose we could only see the foot and did not know that a man dangled from it? We still could not call it into court. Would we establish laws concerning the protection of feet? If so, what about the thousand other parts of the body similarly perceived? It is a poor analogy perhaps, but will have to serve the conclusion. What we do instead is to undertake a formal reticence, a restraint resulting in its protection. For every species we behave as though there were an unseen man attached to it ? some part of our humanity in jeopardy. But this perspective does not really evoke social action or legal policy. Since the connections are unseen they are best referred to indirectly. The official legislation of poetry, drama, or religion is generally unsuccessful. They are their own best arguments. To begin some slight shift in our general sense of acknowledgement or affirmation may be all that is possible ? a rite no more revolutionary than a few moments reflection on the consequences of buying prepared food: a society wolfing down meat it was too chicken to kill and prepare, activities going against the grain because they soil one's hands. fZ| 42 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW/WINTER 1974</page></plain_text>
