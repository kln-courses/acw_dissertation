<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bad King, False King, True King: Aps? and His Heirs Karen Sonik University of Pennsylvania The figure of Aps?, father of the great gods, makes but a fleeting appearance in the late second-millennium-b.c.e. Babylonian epic En?ma elis.1 Tidily disposed of within the first seventy lines of Tablet I, he has at best a peripheral and passive presence in the remainder of the text, his corpse serving as the foundation for Ea's dwelling and his death providing a plausible, if insufficient, justification for Ti?mat's subsequent transformation from protec tive mother to raging destroyer. Under these circumstances, the Aps? episode might reason ably be read as a mere preface to the main action, technically useful to, but nonetheless distinct from, the central conflict between Ti?mat and Marduk. Such a reading, however, would miss out both on those features of the incident that are interesting in their own right and on the importance of the Aps? episode to the broader arc of the narrative. The problem of accurately pinpointing Aps?'s role and identity within En?ma elis, whether as monster or personified or deified subterranean waters,2 springs both from the shifting nature of his depiction in the narrative and from the writing of his name therein, which never includes the divine determinative that marks the gods proper within the text.3 Portrayed as an elemental entity at the opening of the epic as he mingles his waters with those of Ti?mat, Aps? does not remain so for long. Once the first gods are generated from his in tercourse with Ti?mat,4 beginning the process of differentiation, Aps? himself seems to morph into a sort of proto-god, still not endowed with the dingir-determinative but newly provided with anthropomorphic features and with insignia reflecting his new rank and status: He is given both a voice and a mouth with which to speak (Ee I 35-36); a more or This is a revised version of a paper presented at the 2008 American Oriental Society meeting.

The names of all the gods, including the viziers Mummu and Kaska and Ti?mat's new consort Qingu, appear with the divine determinative in the text. Only Ansar, whose name in any case begins with the dingir-sign, is ex cepted. Among the monsters, the lahamu also takes the divine determinative. The names of the remaining monsters, however, and of Aps? and Ti?mat, never take the divine determinative in the text. 4. The nature of this genesis seems passive, almost incidental: Aps? and Ti?mat do not actively create the first gods. Lahmu and Lahamu instead arise from the mingling of their waters: "the gods were created inside of them / Lahmu and Lahamu became visible (and) were given names" (Ee I 9-10).

On the subject of Aps?'s state of dress, it is worth reiterating the association of clothing with life in Mesopotamian literature, specifically with civilized life. Thus, in well-known episodes from the SB Epic of Gilgames, Enkidu dons clothing as the second step in his transformation from wild proto-man to civilized man of the city (Gilg. SB II 34-35),8 while Gilgames, who dresses in lion skins during his wanderings in the wild, again dons his clean royal finery before returning to human civilization (XI 250-70).9 In the case of Aps?, his assumption of the ag? may similarly signify his transformation into a more civilized and active entity, the direct result of his contribution to the differentiation and organization of the world through the generation of the gods. Unfortunately, almost immediately upon completing his extraordinary transformation, Aps? goes to work attempting to undo that which was responsible for it: Disturbed by the clamor of his and Ti?mat's divine children, he and his vizier plot to destroy them (Ee 152).10 This decidedly unparental act is no doubt largely responsible for Aps?'s frequent identifi cation as a monster, as in a discussion by Livingstone: 5. The interpretation of these lines varies. While Lambert reads "Mummu put his arms around Aps?'s neck / He [Aps?] sat on his knees kissing him" ("Mesopotamian Creation Stories," 38), Benjamin Foster suggests "He [Aps?] embraced Mummu, around his neck, He [Aps?] sat on his knees so he could kiss him" {Before the Muses: An Anthology of Akkadian Literature, 3rd ed. [Bethesda: CDL Press, 2005], 441). 6. In his most recently published translation of En?ma elis, Lambert understands riksu as sinew rather than sash or tie; Lambert, "Mesopotamian Creation Stories," 38. The sedation of Aps? is thus followed by the "splitting of] his sinews," suggesting a dissolution of those bonds that hold the elemental entity to his active physical form and his return to his original passive state. 7.

Samhat then persuades Enkidu to go to Uruk to seek out GilgameS, continuing the process of his civilization by clothing him and then leading him to the shepherds' camp where he learns to consume bread and ale (Gilg. SB II 44-51), the food and drink of civilization, and to protect the domesticated animals from the wild (II 59-62).

Z. Bahrani and M. Van De Mieroop (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 2004), 10-18. 9. Following the death of Enkidu, Gilgames sinks into a deep depression, mourning both his friend and his own mortality. Got up like a lion, he roams the wild seeking a cure for his grief and a means of warding off in the inevitability of his own death (X 212-65). His bathing and donning of clean royal robes signify his re-entrance into the civilized human community. 10.

Marduk's own work of creation utilised the body of the Aps?, and the corpse of a second monster, Aps?'s wife Ti?mat, who was defeated and slaughtered by Marduk himself, as is recounted in the fourth tablet of the epic.11 Such a characterization of events proves immediately problematic, however: In failing to address Aps?'s shifting nature within the text, it not only implies a quite unpalatable origin for the gods of En?ma elis as the descendents of a pair of monsters but also causes us to dismiss Aps? as just another monstrous enemy in a narrative riddled with such, blinding us to the more calculated implications of his role within the text. But what exactly is the nature of this role? And if Aps? is not a monster, then what is he? Both Aps? and Ti?mat, after all, commit the same transgression in attempting to destroy their divine children?and Aps?, indeed, commits it first. But where Ti?mat seems clearly to assume the mantle of monstrosity, independently generating monster children before being brutally slain and then butchered for parts, Aps?'s treatment is quite different. There is no attempt to endow him with any monstrous features or creations and he is not only magically anaesthetized by Ea prior to being executed but seems also to be left at least mostly intact after his death.12 To understand the reason for this difference in treatment, we look to Aps?'s execution scene and to the events that follow (I 60-72): Ea, who knows everything, perceived their tricks. He [Ea] fashioned it and made it to be all-embracing, He executed it skilfully as supreme?his pure incantation. He recited it and set it on the waters, He poured sleep upon him as he was slumbering deeply. He put Aps? to slumber as he poured out sleep, And Mummu, the counselor, was breathless with agitation. He split (Aps?'s) sinews, ripped off his crown, Carried away his aura and put it on himself. He bound Aps? and killed him; Mummu he confined and handled roughly. He set his dwelling upon Aps?, And laid hold on Mummu, keeping the nose-rope in his hand.13 In the account of his death and its immediate aftermath, then, Aps? is first put to sleep, and then stripped of his ag? and his melammu,14 with Ea taking the latter of these for himself 11. Livingstone, Mystical and Mythological, 79. Bottero, notably, does not see a problem with identifying monstrous beings (specifically Lahmu and Lahamu) among the earliest divine entities in En?ma elis, asserting that Ti?mat and Aps? were "intertwined, as if in a formidable and motionless coupling, thus giving birth to the first di vinities, who were considered to be still in formation, incomplete and more or less 'monstrous'"; Jean Bottero, Re ligion in Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 2001), 75. Such a reading is, to some extent, supported by the fact that Ti?mat's corpse is referred to as a k?bu, an abortion or monstrosity (Ee IV 136) and by the fact that both Ti?mat and Aps? "shelter monsters before En?ma Elis makes them into a cosmognic [sic] pair and enemies of Marduk," F. A. M. Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts (Groningen: Styx &amp; PP Publications, 1992), 155. 12. If we accept Lambert's interpretation of riksu as sinews rather than as sash(es) or tie(s) (see note 6), then Aps?'s physical form should be understood as encountering at least a little of the same brutalization at Ea's hands that Ti?mat meets at Marduk's. The splitting of Aps?'s sinews would also nicely parallel the later splitting of Ti?mat's corpse though the two actions are not comparable in scale. 13.

The riksu is omitted here; see note 7.</page><page sequence="4">740 Journal of the American Oriental Society 128.4 (2008) prior to executing his forefather. Aps?'s corpse, resuming its original elemental state, is taken as the foundation for Ea's dwelling and so comes to serve as the location of Marduk's be getting and birth. These actions resonate on several levels. The association of clothing with life and civilization was discussed earlier: Nakedness, correspondingly, is frequently asso ciated with a state of powerlessness and with captivity and impending execution, not only in Mesopotamian literature but also in art.15 Aps? has already forfeited his right to his in signia by attempting to destroy the divine order he helped to create: Ea's stripping of him reiterates this point but may also serve a practical purpose, rendering Aps? defenseless and preparing his captive body for death. As noted by Bahrani on the subject of naked prisoners in Mesopotamia: The tradition of depicting both live prisoners and dead enemy soldiers undressed begins in Uruk-Jemdet Nasr seal carvings (c. 3000 BC) and continues into the first millennium BC ... it is possible that the stripping of prisoners was an actual practice seen as an act of subjugation and degradation, or ... a means of preparing them for death by execution.16 Examples of such stripping as they pertain to gods slated for death are known from several literary contexts: In her descent to the netherworld, Inana prepares for her conquest by don ning seven divine powers and is famously denuded of these, one at a time, as she passes through each of the seven gates of the netherworld.17 Left utterly naked and correspondingly powerless at her entrance into the realm of Ereskigal, she is executed for her transgres sion. 18 When she is subsequently resurrected through a trick contrived by the god Enki, a trick notably unavailable to Aps? as Ea is his killer in En?ma elis, it falls upon the unfortu nate Dumuzi to take his wife's place in the netherworld.19 Several surviving texts recount his futile attempts at escape and his capture and stripping at the hands of the netherworld wardens, the galla, prior to his death.20 One such scene recording the interaction between the galla and Dumuzi comes from the Ersemma of Dumuzi and Inana : Take the holy crown off your head, come bareheaded! Take the holy dress off your body, come naked! Lay the holy staff off your hand, come empty-handed! Take the holy sandals off your feet, come barefooted!21 15. See, e.g., in Anton Moortgat, The Art of Ancient Mesopotamia: The Classical Art of the Ancient Near East (London: Phaidon, 1969), the naked prisoners contained within the net held by Ningirsu on the obverse of the Stele of Vultures (fig. 118), the similarly naked captives contained in the net held by Sargon on the Sargon Stele from Akkad (figs. 126, 127), and the line of nude captives appearing on two stelae, one an alabaster example in the Iraq Museum (fig. 136), the other a diorite example from Susa now in the Louvre (fig. 138).

Translated in ibid., 133.</page><page sequence="5">Sonik: Aps? and His Heirs 741 Whether his stripping is meant to humiliate Dumuzi, in addition to preparing him for his impending death, is not always clear. In the specific context of En?ma elis, the denuding of Aps? similarly may or may not imply his humiliation. It does, however, unequivocally render him powerless in preparation for his imminent and permanent death, and for his return to the original elemental and passive state from which he developed. The removal of Aps?'s melammu, and Ea's donning of it, may also serve another purpose, signifying Ea's assumption of Aps?'s position and prominence, as well as his domination over the old (proto-)god. Ea's stature, important in En?ma elis insofar as it is reflected upon his son Marduk, would thus be magnified not by his defeat of a monster but rather by his assumption of Aps?'s greater authority and domain.22 Marduk, then, whose elevation and glorification is the primary intent of the epic, would be the son not of a monster-slayer but rather the son of the god who slew and assumed the realm of the father of the gods. Aps?, after all, as the figure from whom all the great gods are ultimately descended, presumably has power and authority corresponding to this role, even if this is not explicitly stated in the text.23 Aps?'s behavior reinforces this view, as his attempt to destroy the noisy and creative gods evokes the similarly disastrous attempt by a cantankerous but powerful Enlil to destroy the noisy humans in Atrahasis and in the SB Epic ofGilgames.24 Both the plan of Enlil and the plan of Aps? threaten catastrophe for the gods and, as a corollary, for order and civili zation. Both are also effectively thwarted by Ea, the former by a trick that preserves the hierarchy of the gods and Enlil's authority and the latter by outright action against Aps? that effectively creates a new divine hierarchy and line of descent (see fig. 1). Marduk's claim to the kingship of the gods, while ostensibly made on the basis of his defeat of Ti?mat, thus gains an added sense of legitimacy and even inevitability: He has become the direct heir of Aps? not only through the actions of his father Ea, who has assumed Aps?'s realm, but also through the mechanics of his birth, which is specifically stated as taking place within Aps? (I 80-81). The great gods preceding Ea, though they retain authority and a right to respect, are effectively bypassed and the line of legitimate succession is rerouted to lead directly from Aps? to Marduk. This reading of events emphasizes that while En?ma elis may be about the establishment of kingship, and of Marduk's kingship in particular, his is not the only model of divine rulership presented in the epic. It is, indeed, preceded by that of several others: that of Aps?, that of Qingu, and, nominally, that of Ansar as well.25 Aps? threatens the order of the world 22. Atac reaches a similar conclusion, suggesting that "one way for Enki/Ea to depose a god more archaic than he, is to rob him of his melammu. From this standpoint, both the Tablet of Destinies and the melammu . . . are almost accessory-like magical objects conceptualized as the embodiment of power over the cosmos"; Atac, "The Melammu as Divine," 307. For a more thorough and detailed study of the role of melammu in Mesopotamia and the Bible, see Shawn Zelig Aster, "The Phenomenon of Divine and Human Radiance in the Hebrew Bible and in Northwest Semitic and Mesopotamian Literature: A Philological and Comparative Study" (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 2006). 23. That Aps? cannot command the silence of the gods does not really detract from this view, given that even the great god Enlil can command neither the loyalty of his overburdened subject gods nor the silence of the humans in Atrahasis. 24.

Ansar is named king of the gods in Ee IV 83: "Against Ansar, king of the gods, you plotted evil plans."</page><page sequence="6">742 Journal of the American Oriental Society 128.4 (2008) not by wrongly seizing or bestowing power but rather by plotting a very ill advised course of action. His brief tenure as an at least partially anthropomorphic entity corresponds with his role as a legitimate, if unwise?even unjust?ruler, and he loses both his authority and his life through the inappropriate exercise of his power. His almost disastrous reign, marking him as the "bad" king of the tale, is most prominently followed by that of Qingu, the "false" king appointed to the rulership of the rebel gods by Ti?mat, who offers a glimpse of the perils of illegitimate and puppet rulership.26 Standing outside of the proper line of succession, which encompasses the great gods Lahmu and Lahamu, Ansar and Kisar, Anu, Ea, and Marduk, Qingu is one of the lesser deities who comprise Ti?mat's war assembly and battle array. Elevated to the kingship of the gods through his marriage to Ti?mat and her bestowal upon him of the Tablet of Destinies, Qingu temporarily usurps the divine authority that ought properly to descend down the line of Aps? and Ti?mat's rightful heirs, the great gods. After failing to demonstrate any of the intrinsic qualities that would make him worthy of assuming the leadership of the gods,27 however, he is rapidly relieved both of that burden and of his life. While Ansar, who nominally rules over the great gods before Marduk's elevation, is le gitimately within the original line of succession, neither he nor his elder champions, Ea and Anu, prove capable of defeating Ti?mat, and the field is left open for Marduk to offer his services?and to demand his price.28 Only now does Marduk assume the role of the "true king," a role portended by the peculiar circumstances of his birth and by the description of his form and abilities shortly thereafter. "Elected" by the assembly of his illustrious and legiti mately powerful ancestors (IV 1-34; V 78-79, 107-16), Marduk stands in stark and delib erate contrast to Aps? and his other kingly predecessors in En?ma elis, initiating a legitimate, wise, martially vigorous, and prosperous rule over the world as he has ordered it. 26. While Qingu is occasionally mischaracterized as a monster or demon, as in Julye Bidmead, The Akitu Fes tival: Religious Continuity and Royal Legitimation in Mesopotamia (Piscataway, N.J.: Gorgias Press, 2002), 65, he is, at least in the context of En?ma elis, a god and a descendent of Ti?mat, though the exact relationship between the two is not apparent from the text: "From the gods, her offspring, those who formed the assembly /She [Ti?mat] elevated Qingu from among them, she exalted him" (I 147-48). That said, in other, more obscure contexts, Qingu does appear in the company of monsters: "[When Assur] s[ent Ninurta to vanquish] Anz?, Qingu and Asakku, [Nergal announced before Assur]: 'Anz?, Qingu and Asakku are vanquished,'" Alasdair Livingstone, "Marduk Ordeal (Nineveh Version)," Court Poetry and Literary Miscellanea (Helsinki: Helsinki Univ. Press, 1989), 90. 27. The contrast between the pallid and undeveloped character of Qingu with the vital power of Marduk could hardly be more striking: Where Qingu is an undistinguished god raised from an otherwise undifferentiated mass of divine beings (I 147-48), Marduk is not only the ultimate product of an illustrious lineage (I 81-88), but also is perfected, made utterly superior in form and power, by his grandfather Anu (I 91-104). 28. Harris reads the ineffectual leadership of Ansar and the failure of Anu and Ea to successfully neutralize Ti?mat's threat as a function of their old age; see Rivkah Harris, Gender and Aging in Mesopotamia: The Gilgames Epic and Other Ancient Literature (Norman: Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 2000), 81-83. While intriguing, this is in sufficient to explain the nature and outcome of the major conflicts in En?ma elis.</page><page sequence="7">Sonik: Aps? and His Heirs 143 Aps? (masc.)
