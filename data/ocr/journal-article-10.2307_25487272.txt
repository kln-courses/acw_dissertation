<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark Shechner, Guest Editor Exposing Joyce It is about two years now since I published Joyce in Nighttown, my version of a psychoanalytic study of James Joyce and Ulysses, and almost seven years since I began work on the doctoral thesis from which the book was eventually distilled. In these seven years much has happened in the area of study loosely known as applied psychoanalysis to alter my conception of what that study is, what ad vantages and liabilities attend it, and how it is best explained. If, in beginning my own work today, I would not write the same book I started seven years ago it is because I know more about both Joyce and psychoanalysis than I used to and have acquired scruples about the discipline that I did not possess at the outset. It is not the case, however, that these added scruples are the same ones that all op ponents of psychoanalytic criticism would wish for me, since they derive from the experience of writing, not from that of chastisement. During the past seven years the "field" of psychoanalytic criticism, which I place in quotes because I hold it to be a dubious entity, has been polemically active, perhaps excessively so, since debates over method and philosophy just now appear to outnumber, and certainly outweigh in interest, actual applications to literature.1 The net effect of these debates within psychoanalysis and among those who apply it to literature has been to complicate our view of what constitutes the theory and to render its application more uncertain. The infinite regress of corrections within the system has certainly knocked the edge of assurance from practices some of us so recently employed with ease and ?lan. For one thing, the easy application of Freudian tags has fortunately fallen victim to a new emphasis on the uniqueness of each literary "case." Our readings have lost, as a result, a certain lurid ferocity : primal scenes, phallic assaults, and fecal gifts are no longer declared to constitute the core meaning of some meek and un suspecting text. It is especially no comfort to those of us who still believe that psychoanalysis has something essential to tell us about literature that both our leading polemicist, Frederick Crews, and our foremost engineer, Norman Holland, have recently withdrawn the support they once so enthusiastically gave, support that was in strumental in setting the most recent wave of psychoanalytic criticism into motion.2 Crews has lately deplored what he now concedes to have been his own oedipal fervor in advancing psychoanalytic criticism in the late sixties, explaining that his vocation "is to be forever deciding that I would rather not be a fanatic of one sort or another,"3 while Holland now declares against the detailed charts and schematic cutaways of The Dynamics of Literary Response, citing in 266</page><page sequence="2">Exposing Joyce 267 evidence a formal philosophical barrier to assigning deep psychic motives to either characters in fiction or their authors: the im possibility of truly knowing reality of any sort. Even as students new to the discipline open their Dynamics to learn how to spot a "nuclear fantasy" or turn to Crews' essay on "Anaesthetic Criticism" to read up on the latest moves in the judo of critical defense, they find themselves outmaneuvered by their very mentors who, more recently, have taken to higher and reportedly more solid ground, one in the name of the irreducible text, the other in the name of the unknowable one. Thus it is just now that the centers of advanced opinion to which these essays might appeal could not be more inhospitable to their publication. This is, it seems, a fault of the Zeitgeist: what we'll accept as valid in terpretation in literature at any time is largely a question of moment and milieu and this is a moment of retrenchment and consolidation whose effects are noticeable even in such far-flung colonies of the spirit as departments of English literature. To be sure, applied psychoanalysis is not the only cultural boom stock of the sixties to drop points in the bear market seventies. This reversal of fortune may in the long run prove beneficial since it should give psychoanalytic critics an opportunity to learn how much of the esteem, as well as notoriety, recently enjoyed by their work is a result of their accomplishments and how much of their rhetoric. Psychoanalysis re-entered the field of literary study in the sixties on the basis of urgent moral claims, claims that now look to have been something more than mere appeals to the spirit of inquiry. For they were cultural claims, based on a need to demystify and discredit a political and social order whose dominant activities, pursued under the cover of reason, had begun to look decidedly irrational. Having discovered the deceits, as well as the fantasies and obsessions, that un derlay this country's vicious prosecution of a war in Vietnam, it was not difficult for many of us to transfer knowledge gained from the un masking of social policy to our study of Chaucer, Milton, Melville, or whomever we happened to be thinking about at the moment. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, we quickly discovered, had no monopoly on latent content. And yet I would not be honest if I did not admit to remaining uneasy with all heavily-moralized arguments for critical method, including those that psychoanalytic critics have wielded against what they perceive to be the intellectual inertia of traditional literary study. Though I have not always disdained such apologetics or their attendant moralism when they have seemed ap propriate?for the study of literature in the American university does possess a long tradition of backwardness, which is also highly moralized?I have come around to the view that psychoanalytic criticism, like any other, is a practical craft whose virtue lies in its capacity to make intelligent statements about literature, not in its</page><page sequence="3">268 James Joyce Quarterly, Spring 1976 power to make rival critics feel ashamed of themselves. No criticism sustains itself for long on its rhetorical maneuverability, let alone its aggressions and apologies. Criticism is justified only by its power to illuminate and enrich the objects of its study and to discover meanings at a level of analysis that gratifies the intellectual demand for radical knowledge?knowledge about roots and origins. In criticism, unlike politics, ends do justify means. The obstacles in the path of psychoanalytic criticism are by now well-known, certainly to those who have struggled with its ap plication. Many of those obstacles are built into psychoanalytic theory itself, both as a set of historically-biased propositions about the mind and as a science of questionable philosophical status.4 The historical biases of Freudian theory?its patrimony of bourgeois, Viennese mythology?are under furious scrutiny nowadays and the responsible critic can be expected to be aware, at very least, of Freud's strange distrust of women and his stoical indifference to pleasure. But philosophical questions about the nature of psychological evidence and its relationship to psychoanalytic theory, and methodological ones about how evidence is gathered and organized into knowledge are more persistent causes of discomfort for the critic. Our un derstanding of the unconscious mind and its effect upon conscious thought and overt behavior is still provisional and subject to serious, continuous debate. Thus, the bases for choice between available systems of psychological explanation : Freudian, Kleinian, Eriksonian, Laingian, and Winnicottian, to name only some of the best known, are not so evident as we would wish. Since all such systems are in ferences from similar bases of evidence?the verbal and subverbal communications between patient and therapist in a psychiatric relationship?none has a superior claim to being a "science." All, in deed, share in common the habit of casting their propositions in the highly metaphoric and anthropomorphic languages in which psychoanalysis has been steeped from the beginning.5 While there are, to be sure, bases for preference, there is also good reason to look upon the language of psychological explanation, not as a scientific given, but as a choice to be made by the critic himself according to the level of analysis at which he wants to work and the explanatory system in which he feels most at home. We may point too, as Darcy O'Brien does in his essay, "A Critique of Psychoanalytic Criticism, or, What Joyce Did and Did Not Do," to the distortions introduced by the dream model of the literary text, which the greater part of psychoanalytic criticism implicitly assumes. The art-as-dream analogy, according to which The Interpretation of Dreams becomes a manual of critical tactics, promotes a view of the artist as a passive, dreamy sort of character to whom literature hap pens, and whose writing is essentially a defensive, rather than a</page><page sequence="4">Exposing Joyce 269 "meaning creating" production.6 In addition, since Freud developed dream interpretation along lines he had already set down for the in terpretation of neurosis, and came, in fact, to look upon the dream it self as a "transient psychosis," the dream model also implicitly pathologizes literature by reading behavior in the light of illness and seeing creative work as a kind of involuntary, symptomatic activity. Interpretation, then, is the diagnostician's art; it aims at the un masking of latent, pathogenic elements of which the text is only a distorted and inauthentic manifestation. "The work of art," observes Philip Rieff, "is something to see through ; it is presumably best ex plained by something other than?even contradicting?itself."7 Of which Crews now complains, "Thus, no matter what action or text is being examined, the essentials of metapsychology dictate a mode of analysis in which persistent infantile factors will be stressed at the ex pense of non-conflictual ones?cognitive, conventional, formal, or ethical."8 Added to the distortions built into psychoanalytic theory are the disadvantages of performing analysis at a distance, where the cues available to the analyst in the psychiatric dialogue are missing: the patient's associations to the dream or fantasy, the emotional trans ferences between patient and therapist that disclose the terms of other, prior, relationships, and the resistances to analysis itself that signal the presence of highly defended emotional complexes. In con sequence of his lack of access to these tools, the critic frequently finds himself thrown back upon the most primitive of all analytic resour ces: the invariant "Freudian" symbols which express an author's emotional life at the simplest, and ultimately least interesting, levels. These difficulties, it seems to me, constitute major obstacles to doing literary interpretation by way of psychoanalysis, and there are still others which I have not raised. In the face of such a formidable array of obstacles that cannot be dismissed as mere expressions of resistance?whatever the actual motives of those who frequently an nounce them, which is quite another matter?it is no wonder that Holland, since the publication of Psychoanalysis and Shakespeare (1966), has written mainly do-it-yourself handbooks, which disagree with each other on major points of doctrine, and Crews, since The Sins of the Fathers (1966), has spent the better part of his time issuing manifestoes, and then retracting them. All this notwithstanding, it still remains that any serious attempt to assess the quality of thought and emotion that has given rise to a work of art or the emotional sources of its attraction for us, its beholders, has no alternative but to approach it with the best available science of feeling. For all its shortcomings: the ambiguity of its theory, the reductions attending its application, and the fragmentary nature of its findings, psychoanalysis is all we have. Fortunately, despite the</page><page sequence="5">270 James Joyce Quarterly, Spring 1976 debates of methods, findings, and vocabularies, all psychoanalytic psychologies share in common a critical core of propositions about the mind from which a satisfactory analysis can be performed. That core includes the following elements : 1) The dynamic unconscious, the repository of repressed wishes which are incessantly seeking expression and whose access to con scious thought and the means of enactment depends on the efficiency and tactical prowess of what we commonly call the "defense mechanisms" of the ego. 2) The system of intrapsychic dynamics, shared, at least implicitly, by all depth psychologies, which constitutes a set of rules for trans forming motives into statements, fantasies, dreams, symptoms, etc. These unconscious principles of transformation include condensation and displacement, projection and introjection, repression and the return of the repressed, object choice and identification, reversal, splitting, isolation, andsymbolization.9 3) The authority of the past, with its legacy of infantile loves and infantile rages. 4) Infantile sexuality, with its complement of symbiotic, oral, anal, and oedipal varieties of love and aggression that persist into adulthood and complicate our lives with their insistent demands. 5) Psychic determinism, the principle that no thought, word, or act is accidental, that is, lacking a meaningful antecedent in the mind.10 6) Psychic conflict, the mind's unremitting struggle with itself that finds expression in ambivalence, shame, guilt, and the extraordinary human capacity for self-defeat. Had we nothing else in psychoanalysis to work with, which is not the case, a rich and detailed applied criticism could be fashioned from these features of theory alone. To employ psychoanalysis and to adhere, however ambivalently, to one's discoveries are certainly no matters of evangelical faith, as Darcy O'Brien argues from the mistaken analogy to Catholicism, but a matter of informed risk based on the knowledge that one is bringing to bear upon vital but difficult questions about literature the best available theories of mind. It is my belief that while the continued refinement of theory and method is necessary to the development of a reliable applied criticism, it is through the practical commitment to both literature and psychoanalysis that the obstacles to psychoanalytic criticism are best confronted and, to the extent possible, corrected for. For exam ple, the tendency toward reductionism may be, as Crews charges, a property of theory when applied according to case-history models, but it is not, as his deference to William Empson and Harold Bloom also acknowledges, a law, enforced upon the critic by the demands of a system. Psychoanalysis does not write criticism; critics do, and it is</page><page sequence="6">Exposing Joyce 271 their own wealth or poverty of imagination that is finally expressed in what they write. Properly used, psychoanalysis should be an aid to imagining, not a system of controls upon it. At the beginning of this essay I said that I regarded the "field" of psychoanalytic criticism to be a dubious entity, by which I meant that I do not believe there to be a single method of applying psychoanalysis to which the critic owes a special allegiance. Allegiances to method are among the reflexes of academic life, since criticism flourishes in schools (by which I mean here both institutions and the coteries they foster) and schools incline to consistencies of approach and method. But, in criticism, as in art, the influence of schools is largely an illusion, as each member of one eventually discovers when he is alone before the typewriter armed only with his own, usually unfocused, intentions toward literature and whatever understanding of the mind's operations he has to bring to bear upon those intentions. It is in the practice too that many supposed limitations of analysis at a distance are mitigated, since the critic at work invariably learns his own ways to use the contexts to his text as analogues for the writer's missing associations and thereby creates an environment for analysis that frees him from the banalities of oral/anal/phallic symbolism. In practice, the absence of associations is often amply compensated for by rich contexts which are their functional equivalents and would, in the clinical situation, be put to the same use by any analyst. Joyce is a splendid case in point, for his career is as well-documented as any we have: his journals, letters, obiter dicta, drafts, and abundant manuscripts, in addition to his published work, constitute a texture of associations from which analysis can make its way. Only the most fastidious adherents to "the autonomy of the text," who typically an nounce their principles only when contextual arguments turn out to be embarrassing, will be discomforted by the idea that everything is evidence. But the axiom that everything is evidence and therefore useful is really a pragmatic point, and to see criticism in a pragmatic rather than dogmatic light is to cast the burden of its justification upon its ac tual findings rather than on the reputed rigor or flexibility of a theory which cannot be abstractly tested. As Philip Slater has claimed for his own practice of identifying figures in Greek mythology with members of the family in his book, The Glory of Hera, "The validity of the equations cannot be proved but they can perhaps be justified by the usefulness of the results."11 To do otherwise and to dismiss arguments that are patently useful merely because they are disturbing or reduc tive or because areas of their supporting theory are known to be held in question is to give up altogether wanting to know what art is, where it comes from, and what its place is in the pattern of human evolution. Indeed, whole areas of human learning are thereby renounced, since</page><page sequence="7">272 James Joyce Quarterly, Spring 1976 psychoanalysis is the only system of ideas we have that allows us to generalize from mind to family and from family to culture, and thus to forge the links between emotions and culture that are requirements of a full view of literature. Freud's "psychology," Lionel Trilling reminds us, "involves culture in its very essence?it tells us that the surrogates of culture are established in the mind itself, and that the development of the individual mind recapitulates the development of culture."12 The brand of anti-intellectualism which fears that life may prove a contaminant to books has to be recognized for what it is : an academic ideology designed to protect entrenched professionals from the news that art has properties that lead beyond the curriculum toward, among other things, emotions. That ideology owes its authority to the professionalization and departmentalization of literary study, ac cording to which the orderly subdivisions of the university catalogue are unconsciously taken to describe the realms of available knowledge. Thus it is that the introduction of perspective or scope to humanistic thought is frequently miscalled "interdisciplinary" study. Psychoanalysis, in rejecting tidy, academic views of curriculum, calls for the taking of certain risks, both bureaucratic and intellectual, and the critic who employs it understands that he is on slippery ground and knows too that he frequently must decide between backing prudently away from a position for which evidence is in conclusive and forging ahead with his argument, risking discomfort for the sake of discovery. For psychoanalysis, when rigorously ap plied, is an embarrassing enterprise whose practitioner risks sounding silly for gains that may turn out to be small. It insists on analyzing its subject at that level of human experience and feeling that our culture assures us that we, as adults, have long since left behind : the infantile, with its appalling emotions and its shameful involvement with the most undignified parts of the body. Thus the atmosphere of high ad venture in which psychoanalysis seems to thrive and the heavy doses of rhetoric that usually attend its discussion, for it engages deep and troubled quarters of our emotional lives and mobilizes powerful resistances. And the critic, in analyzing his subject at these levels, necessarily exposes himself, since the capacity for spotting infantile dynamics is in large measure intuitive and made possible by the critic's recognition (which may be unconscious) of common emotional bonds with his subject. So while the application of psychoanalysis does call for a mustering of faith, it is a different kind of faith from the sort required by religion. The difference between a system of faith that asks its adherents to play it safe on the chance of being judged for eternity and one that encourages intellectual leaps in the name of enriched knowledge could not be greater. The ethos of psychoanalysis is far closer to the faith of Stephen Dedalus than to that of Father Arnall.</page><page sequence="8">Exposing loyce 273 Lest any Joyce scholar miss the point, the long-awaited publication of the new edition of Joyce's letters, which includes the full text of the previously interdicted letters from James to Nora, is an emphatic reminder, since this is not just new data to fill out the historical record, like the school exams recently discovered in Padua by Professor Berrone, but a challenge to criticism itself to show that it knows how to reconcile Joyce's startling attitudes towards love with the traditional view of Joyce as the "fabulous artificer." Here is a man who, after all, wanted both to revel in his wife's shit and to forge im perishable monuments to the Irish imagination. Might the two not have something to do with each other? It is the quality of risks well-taken that distinguishes the essays in this volume. They are all, I believe, essays in the Montaignian sense, which declare themselves to be creative encounters with literature. These critics themselves are amateurs in the best sense of the word: lovers, who pursue difficult lines of inquiry for the love of the in tellectual discipline itself. It would overstate my actual sense of achievement in these essays to say that the accomplishment of each is in proportion to the conceptual risks taken, though my feelings incline that way. Consider, after all, where we stand in our study of Joyce, fifty-four years after the publication of Ulysses and thirty-seven since the ap pearance of Finnegans Wake in book form. We are, I am convinced, at an impasse of overproduction; so much is already known about Joyce and his books and yet we continue to produce as though an infinite supply of new knowledge lay waiting for our discovery. But, in fact, returns on our investment in abstracted empiricism have diminished almost to the zero point and we ourselves, in a foreshortened version of Viconian history, have begun to recycle our old knowledge. Barring the surprise emergence of a hidden text of substance or biographical revelations of unexpected importance (and the letters to Nora aren't really revelations), we are done for good with the phase of discovering Joyce. But we're far from done with thinking about him, and that is where psychoanalysis comes in. But such gains as we may make by means of psychoanalysis or other forms of critical in vestigation yet to be brought to bear will be made at the ordinary costs that attend the asking of difficult questions; psychoanalysis is not now nor will it soon become a handy, self-applying system of thought. But our mistakes in using it are not moral errors and we needn't worry about paying for them eternally in the company of our dean of studies or department chairman. Our risks are only risks of the mind, which is what criticism has always been about. State University of New York at Buffalo</page><page sequence="9">274 James Joyce Quarterly, Spring 1976 NOTES 1. See especially Frederick C. Crews, "Anaesthetic Criticism" (1970), and "Reduc tionism and its Discontents" (1975), both now collected in his Out of My System (New York: Oxford, 1975). The continuing debate includes Murray Schwartz, "The Space of Psychological Criticism," and Norman Holland, "A Letter to Leonard," both in Hart ford Studies in Literature, 5 (1973), x-xxi and 9-30.

Later and somewhat different versions of the questions involved will be discussed in the Spring 1976 issue of New Literary History which will include David Bleich, "The Subjective Paradigm," and Holland, "The New Paradigm : Subjective or Transactive?" 2. Crews' "Reductionism" essay is in effect a declaration that he no longer wishes to be regarded as a psychoanalytic critic. Holland's more recent announcements, which in clude the articles above and his last two books : Poems in Persons (New York : Norton, 1973), and Five Readers Reading (New Haven : Yale, 1975), represent a turn away from practical criticism toward model building, and of a kind that promotes readers' naive responses to literature at the expense of their ideas about it, thereby de-emphasizing critical thought in favor of self-understanding. 3.
