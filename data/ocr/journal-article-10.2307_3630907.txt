<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arte Rupestre en la Comunidad Valenciana. Rafael Martinez Valle, ed. Valencia: Generalitat Valenciana, 2005, 453 pp., black-and-white and color photographs, maps, and tracings. 447.00, cloth. Spare no expense! This huge, handsome, lavishly illustrated book on the rock art of eastern Spain is more than a "coffee-table-tome," and yet it is the kind of volume that the Valencian Regional Government will be proud to display and to present to privileged guests. Despite the emphasis on photographs and tracings of extraordinary quality, the 27 chapters do contain considerable and indeed substantive text (unencumbered by bibliographic references or too much jargon). This is not a book for specialists, but certainly any person seriously interested in Stone Age rock art can gain a great deal from reading most of the texts, thereby clearing up much of the ambiguity that has existed on the topic of the rock art of Greater Valencia since Henri Breuil and Hugo Obermaier in the first half of the twentieth century (wrongly) attributed all or most of it to the late Paleolithic. (Note that the Valencian Region is administratively and historically composed of the provinces of Castell6n, Valencia sensu stricto, and Alicante, generally known as Levantine Spain, which is the same thing as eastern Spain minus Catalonia to the north and Murcia to the south [all these, plus eastern Andalucia, are Mediterranean Spain].) The term "Levantine art" is now restricted in its usage by specialists to a Journal ofAnthropological Research, vol. 62, 2006</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 273 particular style phase of Neolithic art emphasizing realistic scenes of human life (especially hunting and warfare), rather than being applied to all post-Paleolithic art in eastern Spain After a broad contextualization of the Valencian cases within the framework of rock art worldwide by Jean Clottes and a summary of the relevant regional Upper Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic archaeological records by Mauro Hemrnndez, Valentin Villaverde, and Rafael Martinez, there are several interesting chapters on the history of research on Valencian rock art with marvelous old photographs, reproductions of preliminary sketches and definitive tracings, and notes and publications by the pioneer specialists: Juan Cabr&amp;, Breuil, Obermaier, Juan Bautista Porcar, Martin Almagro Basch, Francisco Jordai (recently deceased), Eduardo Ripoll (still living), and others. The debate surrounding the age of Levantine Art (sensu lato) is now largely over, but it had been a lively one (and not the only one in which Breuil ultimately ended up on the losing side, though he defended his point of view up to the time of his death a few months after his participation in the famous Wenner-Gren (here repeatedly misspelled "Green") Symposium on "Prehistoric Art of the Western Mediterranean and the Sahara" held in Burg Wartenstein, Austria, in 1960. The book closes with a series of articles on "management" of the rock art (conservation, geological context, public dissemination, museology, and research), underlining the central importance of the Servicio de Investigaci6n Prehist6rica in Valencia, a solid, dynamic research institute founded in 1927 and among whose early research projects was the absolutely critical excavation of Parpall6 cave by Luis Pericot between 1929 and 1931. The renewed interest in Valencian art (now with an economic spin, as certain sites are protected rural tourist attractions) is manifested in the creation of new museum/research centers (notably that of Valltorta, within the major Valltorta-Gassulla Cultural Park) and exhibits in existing museums (such as the ultra-modern Alicante Archaeological Museum). That the region is proud of its rock art (part of a UNESCO World Heritage Rock Art Region in Mediterranean Spain-the third UNESCO rock art designation for Iberia, the other two being Altamira Cave in Cantabrian [northern Atlantic] Spain and the C6a Valley open-air rock art area in northeastern Portugal) is made clear by the fact that this volume is doubly prefaced by the president and the cultural secretary of the Valencian government. (The president's Preface is titled "Our Rock Art, Patrimony of Humanity"-that says it all!) The vast middle sections of the book are of unequal length, though not interest. The exquisitely illustrated segment on Upper Paleolithic art consists of three chapters by Villaverde, who several years ago did a monumental analysis of the nearly 6000 engraved limestone slabs found by Pericot in Parpall6. These objects used to be the sole representatives of Upper Paleolithic artistic activity in eastern Spain, and they are still key to the dating of what remains a small but important group of cave paintings and engravings that now have been identified (mostly in southern Valencia Province in the mountainous country inland of the Cabo de la Nao). One of the most startling recent discoveries is an engraving of a horse on a wall of Parpall6 (heretofore unseen by generations of archaeologists visiting the site-including myself!) that was covered by sediments dating to the late Solutrean Journal ofAnthropological Research, vol. 62, 2006</page><page sequence="3">274 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH and, judging by its height, was probably done in the early Solutrean-the great period of Paleolithic artistic activity in both Valencia and Andalucia. Other parietal images are, however, stylistically dated by Villaverde to the Magdalenian (notably Cova Fosca). As with Upper Paleolithic art in the rest of Iberia and in France (except the "Well Scene" in Lascaux), there are no hunting scenes-just animals, which were, in fact, mostly human prey (red deer and ibex). With the end of the Last Glacial and the Paleolithic ca. 11 kya, this art (portable and parietal) ended, and the current paradigm suggests an interruption of artistic activity during the Epipaleolithic/Mesolithic. However, it should be noted that there are no direct radiocarbon dates of rock art in this region, since drawings done with charcoal are scarce, with red iron ochres being the main pigments used in all periods. After some 15,000 years of very similar Upper Paleolithic art (Gravettian through Magdalenian), the very few thousand years of the Neolithic (and here the chronology is frankly still "fuzzy") saw the creation of three supposedly different art styles and/or phases in the Valencian region: Macro-schematic, Levantine, and Schematic. The first and especially the last are given relatively short treatment in this book compared with the much better known Levantine art, and, quite frankly, this reviewer is not sure that this book at least has made a clear case for the separateness of the two "schematic" styles. The tripartite chronology of post- Paleolithic Valencian rock art is based on a few superpositions (notably La Sarga, near Alcoy in southern Valencia), indicating that non-naturalistic Macro-schematic images can underlie more naturalistic Levantine ones. In the chapter on space and time in the post-Paleolithic art of eastern Spain by Juliain Martinez, a map (p. 184) shows there to be 15 cases of Schematic Art superimposed on Levantine, 8 of Levantine on Macro-schematic, and 6 of Levantine on Schematic. The "Macro" art is described by Mauro Hernandez, who is one of the first researchers to notice similarities between some decorations on early Neolithic (Cardial) ceramic vessels and some Macro rock art images. The hallmarks of this strange art are anthropomorphic figures with upraised arms ("praying" humanoids) and serpentine figures. A compelling chapter by Sara Fair6n shows that many Macro loci grandly and visibly dominate important Neolithic agricultural territories and avenues of communication. It is interesting that many of the same areas and often the same rockshelters (there is no true cave art, as in the Paleolithic) were decorated in two or more of the styles, sometimes with over-painting, or "refreshing" of images, sometimes with "respect" for preexisting images, with new art being done nearby. How much time actually separated the different styles and the nature of their relationship both remain unclear. Villaverde leads off and solidly anchors discussion of Levantine art-the most spectacular and best-known of the three styles, generally found in montane settings, including the sides of deep gorges. The art is not done in living sites; indeed the rockshelters are generally bare of sediments. The panels show scenes of lively, bloody hunts, with running, bow-and-arrow-shooting hunters, dying deer and ibex: lots of action. (The images are so detailed that they show both simple and recurved bows, for example.) The interpretation argued here is that this is prestige hunting among people who were otherwise Neolithic farmer-pastoralists-ironically, since Journal ofAnthropological Research, vol. 62, 2006</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 275 Paleolithic people who lived largely from hunting did not paint such scenes. This is reminiscent of the place that hunting holds in modern, industrialized societies, although certainly there must have been a much more significant dietary contribution from venison among the Neolithic societies of Valencia than among the "civilized" ones of today's Western Europe or the U.S., even if trophies were important in both kinds of societies. The grandiose settings and art representations of the Valltorta canyon cliffs (with such famous loci as Remigia) are the subjects of a chapter by Pere Guillem, who follows this with a chapter on graphic war scenes in the Levantine art of the Maestrazgo Mountains in northern Castell6n (notably the Civil rockshelter, but also many more). Representations of clothing and ornaments are described next by Virginia Barciela; the details are fantastic, and they include descriptions of the relatively rare figures of women and children. Esther L6pez Montalvo gives an all-to-brief description of how hunting activities are portrayed, but presents some marvelous images, including one apparently showing dogs attacking a stag (p. 276). The different ways in which the human figure is portrayed in Levantine art are discussed by In6s Domingo, showing how it supposedly became progressively less naturalistic and more elongated and "deformed," although it is not clear whether there is much of a "stratigraphic" basis to support this stylistic "chronology." One criticism of the book in general is that the authors presume reader knowledge of the location of various towns, districts, or physical features throughout the Valencian region; this could have been remedied with more thoroughly labeled maps. Mauro Hernmndez introduces the subject of Schematic art with a chapter titled "Between the Scheme and the Abstraction." This style of art has many "signs" and rather simple "stick-figures" of both ungulates and humans. There are parallels to both in Neolithic ceramics and worked bones ("eyed" and "bi-triangular" idols). This theme is expanded upon and convincingly illustrated by Palmira Torregrosa and Maria Francia. The final substantive chapter in the book discusses the far- less-well-known Holocene rupestral engravings of Valencia, ranging in age from the Neolithic to the historic era with metal-incised images (including a particularly elaborate galleon [p. 343]). This book is an exemplar of how the world's regions should value, study, and preserve their rock art, a cultural resource under threat of vandalism and development from Albuquerque to Alqueva. And it reminds us that the phenomenon of marking rocks spans the whole period of existence of anatomically modem humans on the inhabited continents.
