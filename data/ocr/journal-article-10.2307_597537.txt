SAeID AD-DARIMI, nach der in der Kbpriihlibibliothek aufbewahrten Handsclhrift (Cod. 850) zum ersten Male herausgegeben und mit Einleitung und Kommentar versehen von G6STA VITESTAM. Pp. 116. (Introduc- tion and notes) + 126 (Arabic text), 2 plates, Arabic indices. Lund: C. W. K1. GLEERUP, and Leiden: E. J. BRILL, 1960. Kr. 48, Gld. 35. There were two Darimis in the ninth century A. D., both Sunnite hadith scholars. The older one, better known, was 'Abdallah Ibn 'Abd ar-Rahman of Samarqand (797-869), the compiler of a collec- tion of Traditions which came to be ranked below the six canonical collections. Abfl Sa'ld 'Uthman of Seistan (816-96) was a Traditionist, faqih and theologian, who had studied Traditions under the imam Ahlmad Ibn Hanbal and others, and law under the Shafilite Yfisuf Ibn Yahiyd al-BuwaytL. After studies in Damascus and elsewhere he settled in Herat, where he spent his later years. The little that is known about him is brought together by Dr. Vitestam in his introduction; he adds an Arabic extract from the chief biographical source, Ibn tAsakir's History of Damascus. Two books by Ab-f SatId have survived, both in a single manu- script: the present work, which there is reason to think is earlier, and one entitled an-Naq1, which the editor intends to publish in due course. Both are works of controversy, condemning heresies from a strict Sunnite point of view. Among the "retort " books (radd) of early "Abbasid theological literature several are directed against the followers of Jahm Ibn Safwan. Ibn Hanbal's Kitab ar-radd 'alaz-Zanddiqa wal-Jah- mTya briefly answers the Jahmiya on two major points, their "purification" (tanzih) of the at- tributes of God from anything anthropomorphic and their doctrine of the created Qur'&amp;n. Ddriml's work, written around 860-70, is a little longer (33 folios). It refutes the Jahmite doctrines on each attribute in turn, and on the created Qur'&amp;n. There is no chapter on the notorious qadar prob- lem, evidently because on this the Sunnite position was not yet clearly differentiated from the pre- destinarian view of the Jahmiya. The publication of Ddrim!'s work is valuable, on one hand, as making available another important source for the reconstruction of the position of the Jahmiya, so prominent in early Islamic theology and almost inaccessible in any direct manner. The Sunnite party destroyed their writings, and in the same spirit Darimi's retort deliberately restricts its statements of their doctrine " for fear that weak hearts may be unable to hold out against it " (text, p. 8, lines 9-10; cf. p. 102, lines 13-17). Most of Dr. Vitestam's introduction is devoted to a careful reconstruction of the Jahmite position on each of the attributes treated, by drawing out the implications of Darimil's replies, with the help of other sources. The picture that appears does not differ in its main lines from what was previously known, as described for example by W. Ml. Watt in Free will and predestination in early Islam (Lon- don, 1948), pp. 99-104. But it is certainly useful to have some of the details filled in, as a step towards the general monograph on the Jahmiya that some day needs to be written. On the other hand, there is a certain interest in Ddrimil's methods of refutation, as an example of Islamic controversial writing in the ninth century.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 567 In the Shafitite tradition, he announces his inten- tion to "ascribe to Him the attributes which He ascribed to Himself, and which the Messenger ascribed to Him" (p. 1, lines 15-16), and a high proportion of the text consists of quotations from the Qur'an and Traditions from the Prophet. But there are also many Traditions from the Com- panions and Successors, and a few references to ijmdt. Then, after the citing of many authorities, Ddrim! usually makes explicit his interpretation of them, sometimes using analogical arguments, and shows the absurdity of the Jahmite interpretation. Thus it cannot be seen that Ddrim! is following any particular school in his theological method, but only that he is of the ahl as-sunna, a fore- runner of Ashtar! in a general way. The argu- ments sometimes strike a modern reader as sophis- tical, and there is no lack of abuse of the Jahmiya as zindiqs and kafirs. Dr. Vietstam's introduction gives a discerning account of Darimi's methods. The Arabic text is scrupulously edited, from photographs of the single manuscript, K6priilii 850, fols. 76a-109b. Sparse punctuation and vowel marks have been inserted by the editor. The print- ing of the Arabic attains the high standard of accuracy usually found in the work of Brill, though there are a few misprints over and above those listed on the loose page of corrections. The commentary is largely devoted to a very diligent listing of references to the Traditions quoted, and variant readings of them. The editor occasionally gives his translation of a sentence, but a few more explanations of difficult passages would have been desirable, as this text contains a number of obscurities. The work as a whole is an admirable example of North European thoroughness applied to the scholarly edition and exposition of an Arabic text. Although this is by now a part of an old tradition, we still need many more such productions before Islamic civilization can be understood on a truly sound basis. GEORGE F.
