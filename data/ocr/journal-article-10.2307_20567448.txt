<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS IN LOUGH FAUGHAN CRANNOG, CO. DOWN, 1951-52 by A. E. P. COLLINS INTRODUCTION. LOUGC FAUGHAN crannog lies about three miles south-west of Downpatrick (fig. 1). It now appears as a low circular mound (fig. 2), some 110 ft. in diameter, with a centre 31 ft. higher than its perimeter. For many years until recently it has been under cultivation as a garden. It is surrounded by a treacherous swamp of reeds, willows, and alders through which there is now a single safe way of approach, from the north. The lough, which gave it its name, had a former extent of 4 acres (Harris (1744), 151), but has now shrunk to quite a small area of morass which shows no open water. A series of deep drainage channels cut through the surrounding fields indicates the reason for this. The name is now anglicised on the O.S. maps as Lough Falcon.

A medieval glazed jug from it has been in the National Museum, Dublin, since before the compilation of Wilde's Catalogue (Wilde, Sir W. (1857), 158). The earliest useful reference to the site so far discovered dates from 1878 (O'Laverty (1878), 305, footnote). He mentions that 'large quantities of antiquities have been found, including a silver fibula and stone querns.' It was felt that the Archicological Survey should investigate a crannog in Co. Down (no record remains of excavation in any Down crannog) and two points dictated the choice of the Lough Faughan site: the crannog was readily accessible and might not be seriously waterlogged in view of the draining away of the lough; the jug now in Dublin had close parallels from the 13th century stone castles of the county and perhaps indicated an occupation contemporaneous with that of the castles, however early the origins of the crannog. Excavation began in August-September, 1951, when the north-west quadrant was examined, and continued jn the same season of the following year, when attention was given to the north-east quadrant. Thanks are due to the owner, Miss Crolty, for permission to excavate. The drawings and photographs accompanying this report are reproduced by permission of the Ministry of Finance. THE EXCAVATION. Excavation began with a 3 ft. wide cutting on a radius through the site and was followed by a grid system of rectangular cuttings. Each box cutting was excavated downwards until the seeping of water stopped further deepening. Some assistance in controlling the water was got from a hand-operated sludge pump supplemented in the following season by a petrol-driven pump. Baulks between the cuttings were left intact except for those along the main east-west axis of the site, where they were removed to give a nearly complete cross-section on this diameter. Excavation in the 1952 season was carried down several feet deeper than in 1951 but nowhere did we meet with the natural strata on which the crannog rested. Excavation, even in the half of the crannog which was examined, has therefore been of a very incomplete nature. A much greater expenditure of time and resources would be necessary to obtain an adequate picture of the site. The composition of the crannog, as revealed in sections A-B and D-B-C (figs. 5 and 6), is broadly similar to the crannogs of Lagore and Ballinderry 1. As at those sites, a purely structural substratum supported occupational levels on top of it. In detail, however, there were marked differences. Nowhere at Lough Faughan was the outer edge of the crannog, whether of close-set piling or of plank-and-post palisading, met with. This is not to deny its existence; extension of the main axial cuttings into the swamp might reveal the original margin of the site below the present water-level. Extension of our cuttings downward should also have shown the bog or lake deposits on which the lowest levels of the crannog were placed. These are probably not much below the lowest level reached in the centre of the crannog, where a total thickness of 14 ft. of deposits was cut through. The lowest levels seen there were bedded almost horizontally and are probably not far above the underlying natural deposits. A boring recently carried out by Messrs. M. E. S. Morrison and V. B. Proudfoot in the bog deposits outside the</page><page sequence="4">48 A. E. P.

The main bulk of the substructure was composed of layers of brushwood, including hazel, alder and birch, alternating with layers of peat. At int6rvals, stratified among these deposits, were placed layers of bluish or yellowish clay. A striking distinction between the Lough Faughan site on the one hand and Lagore and Ballinderry 1 crannogs on the other was the comparative scarcity of heavy timbers and the discontinuous and more or less random placing of those which did occur at our site. Vertical timbers or piles were met with very sparingly, though in several areas on the site thick deposits of brushwood were held down and reinforced by slender sharpened stakes 1j to 21 ins, in diameter, driven vertically through them. Much of the heavy timbering that had been laid horizon. tally was pegged down in the same way; yet the mortice-holes through which the vertical stakes had been driven were apparently invariably pre-existing features in the timbers. In fact, much of the wood used, especially that which was laid horizontally, was second-hand material, individual pieces of which are illustrated and discussed below. No continuous pattern of timbering was noticeable on the site. Fig. 3 shows a series of what appear to be random and unconnected groupings of timbers. Some, as for instance those immediately north-east of Hearth 4, appeared to be pieces thrown down in a haphazard manner, along with stones and bones to stabilise the brushwood and peat. Other areas, however, showed more purposeful arrange ments. Thus, beneath and to the south of Hearth 7 was a well-made raft or platform at a depth of 6-7 ft. below the present surface, probably to be correlated with our second layer of brushwood (fig. 6). These logs and planks, laid edge to edge, formed a rectangular platform at least 10 ft. long and some 6 ft. broad. Whether this indicates the foundations of a hut of some kind or merely a sort of staging used in the construction of the site seems uncertain. If it indicates part of a permanent dwelling, then the inference that permanent occupation of the site began at the level of the highest brushwood plus wicker matting will have to be modified. A superficially similar area of more roughly laid logs (TI on fig. 3) in the adjacent cutting is to be linked with the top brushwood layer and may be legitimately considered as part of the main occupation level. The brushwood and peat layers were not always easy to distinguish. Much of the peaty material was in reality layers of reeds, bracken, heather, and other scrubby plant growth, cut and used along with the brushwood. Certain layers were noticeable as almost pure bracken; others as composed of heather. Widely distributed throughout these layers and the brushwood were animal bones, mostly of domesticated species (see Appendix 3). Also embedded in peat and brushwood were occasional artifacts. These included whetstones, one or two sherds of crucibles, a few small wooden items described below (p. 65) and pieces of sawn deer antler. A few noteworthy metal objects including an iron shield boss (no. 75), a (?) scale-pan (no. 69), and a pair of iron shears (no. 67) also came from these structural levels. It was noticeable that no sherds of ordinary souterrain type came from these deeper levels. The brushwood layers were for the most part tangled masses of small sticks and</page><page sequence="6">50 A. E. P.

At more than one level the brushwood had been neatly woven into a wicker 'mat.' At the centre of the crannog 6 layers of brushwood were distinguishable and have been numbered accordingly (fig. 6). The highest (no. 6) included an area seen in plan in fig. 3 and in pl. of neatly woven matting. rhe wood appeared to be hazel. The 'warp' strands were here supported on a very roughly constructed timber framing. Another small area was placed about 1 ft. 6 ins. below the large hearth (Hearth 4). A further area is shown supported on horizontal timbers at the outer fringe of the north-east quadrant. The heavy timbers used here included no. 81 (p. 65). All these three areas of matting can be approximately equated with the junction between the lower structural and the upper occupation levels, at a depth of 3-4 ft. below the present surface of the site. A striking feature of the structural levels of the site, when viewed in the east west section (fig. 6) is the fact that the crannog appears to have been built out eastwards from near its present western edge. Nearly all the recognisable strata are banked up against what must be presumed to be an early 'core' of peat at the western side. In consequence, all show a tendency to dip down from west to east. Alternatively, this could be explained by a general subsidence of the eastern part of the site, so that deposits which were originally laid in a level manner had since acquired this marked dip. The occupation levels of the crannog were basically composed of a dark brown to black peaty soil which merged gradually with the underlying peat and brush wood. Throughout the soil occurred abundant traces of occupation, such as animal bones, sherds, iron implements, and evidences of bronze and iron working (Appendix l). At varying levels through this occupation earth occurred purely local spreads of clay and ash which seemed to have been deposited to cover the damper and more noisome parts of the occupation levels. Some of the clay spreads towards the top of the occupation levels had been more or less reddened by burning. Scattered about over most of the excavated area of the crannog were numerous hearths. A few of these, well down in the structural levels (cf. Hearth 5, fig. 3), need mean no more than the cooking of food by the builders. Most were above the main wicker matting horizon and must represent evidences of occupation, whether industrial or domestic. A feature common to all hearths seems to have been the preparation of a clay floor or platform on which the fire was made. Considering the wood and brushwood construction of the site, this was probably a vital precaution, at least in dry seasons. Some of the hearths were mere circular patches of superimposed layers of ash and yellow ash-clay mixture alternating with thin charcoal layers. The largest hearth met with (Hearth 4, fig. 3), some 14 ft. in diameter, and with a maximum thickness of nearly 2 ft., showed in section up to 7 superimposed layers of grey ash and yellow ash-clay mixture, alternating with thin charcoal layers. Another hearth (Hearth 6, fig. 3 and pl. VII) began life as a circular structure about 8 ft. in diameter, bounded by a kerb of stones. Overlying the ash in this hearth was a deposit 2 ft. thick of stiff yellow clay which formed the foundation of a new stone-lined hearth of smaller dIimensions. Separating this hearth froom yet a third was a layer of brown peaty soil. The third hearth, a series of alternating</page><page sequence="8">52 ~~~~~~A. E, P. COLLINS o U,~~~~~~~C '0 co 4c 0~~~~~~~~~</page><page sequence="9">LOUGH FAUGHAN CRANNOG 53 layers of ash and burnt clay, appeared to have been bordered by a set of upright posts. The holes for four of these appeared in section (pl. VII). This group of superimposed hearths represented a longer sequence of fires on the same spot than at any other of the hearths that were met with. The depth of the lowest levels of Hearth 6, some 6 ft. below the present ground level, might seem to be at a greater depth than the lowest occupation levels uncovered at other points near the centre of the crannog. Nevertheless, at this point no recognisable brushwood or wicker mat levels overlay the hearth, so it can only be assumed that the total depth of occupation strata at this point is greater than elsewhere on the site. Compression of the lower structural levels under the considerable weight of clay and stones in the hearths may well be a partial explanation for this greater thickness of the occupation levels. One hearth (Hearth 3, fig. 3) was a neat rectangular construction edged with stones and filled with alternate layers of grey ash and charcoal which had accumulated on a few stones placed as a rough paving. Another (Hearth 7) with circular stone kerb lay almost immediately underneath the stone revetment wall. Not shown on the plan, it is illustrated in pl. VII. Presumably it is one of the latest structures on the site prior to the building of the stone revetment. The occupation deposits and their associated hearths contained small finds and pottery. which were exclusively of Early Christian types. Their dark soils did not differ appreciably from the modern humus above them, But at many points over the site at depths of 1-2 ft. below the present ground surface were thin spreads of ochreous gravel (a type 'of deposit not met with at lower levels), and some patches of fire-reddened clay. Towards the centre of the crannog, in the north western quadrant, at depths of just over 1 ft. and just underlying these gravelly spreads was a considerable expanse of black burnt material, including charcoal, burnt chaff or straw and a fair quantity of carbonised oats and barley (Appendix 2). Immediately overlying the thin gravel spreads which, in turn, cover the burnt layer was a depth of 1-2 ft. of dark soil stained by humus and occupation material. While surviving to a thickness of about 1 ft. in the centre of the crannog, it deepens to nearly 3 ft. towards the outer edges of the site, where it is bounded by a polygonal dry-stone revetment wall (figs. 4, 5, and 6). This wall, which extends almost to modern ground level, was built of small boulders and flagstones of the local Silurian rocks. To what height it was originally carried is uncertain. The maximum surviving height of wall is of 3 courses, near point A (fig. 4). The outer face of the wall is straight and well built of stones larger than the body of the wall, which appears in places to overlie the dark earth which it revets. The spread of dark earth and its revetment wall combined give the impression of a deliberate levelling-off of the upper surface of the crannog. It is noteworthy that the wall was not seen on the western edge of the site. Perhaps if our cuttings had been extended into the swamp we should have found traces. Yet one cannot help noticing that the wall appears to be only on that side of the site where subsidence was postulated to account for the dip in the structural strata (p. 51). It looks as if the stone-revetted levelling of the top of the site was a final attempt to correct a tendency for the eastern part of the site to sink. With the probable exception of Hearth 1, no recognisable structures could be</page><page sequence="10">54 A. E. P. COLLINS Ia 0 ..

Within the area enclosed by it and indicated in fig. 4 were numerous clusters of similar stones in the first 1-2 ft. of soil. Wherever they could be related to the thin gravel spreads they were seen to overlie them. They are thus of the same date or later than the revetment. Their function remains unknown; it seems likely that cultivation and burrowing animals have caused too much disturbance of these levels to allow of any clear pattern emerging. Dating of these uppermost levels remains difficult. While the occupation earth below the thin gravel spreads contained exclusively Early Christian-type material, the levels above the gravel showed the same types mixed with a few medieval sherds (p. 58). Since these levels are in no way sealed, it is impossible to say whether the stone structures should be dated by the medieval sherds or not. The sudden change-over in building methods from the peat-brushwood-and-timber to stone construction is perhaps significant in showing a prolonged break in occupation. It is perhaps worth stressing that the builders of the stone-revetted platform on top can hardly have appreciated the soft compressible nature of the crannog substructure when they added this heavy top-hamper to the site-an argument which supports the theory of a break in occupation. If this be accepted, the Early Christian material found in the uppermost levels may reasonably be regarded as rubbish survivals. THE FINoS. Pottery. With the exception of one or two pieces of crucible, all the sherds from the crannog came from the upper (i.e., occupation) levels. While pottery came from various positions sealed by spreads of clean clay and gravel, and therefore presumably in undisturbed strata, the majority was met with in the uppermost 1-2 ft. of occupation soil and modern humus which had been disturbed by garden ing and by rabbit burrows. There is, too, the probability suggested above (p. 53) that these uppermost layers are in the nature of fill behind the stone revetment waIl. Stratigraphy is therefore of little help in analysing the pottery. Some 230 sherds in all were recovered. Most of these fall within the range of hand-made wares normal in Early Christian raths and souterrains in east Ulster. The remainder comprise: a rim sherd of terra sigillcta; two wheel-thrown sherds which possibly represent Dark Age imports from the Continent (pl. VIII); one complete crucible (fig. 12, no. 72) and sherds from others; and five medieval sherds. The so-called 'souterrain' wares (fig. 7, nos. 1-12, and fig. 8, nos. 13-17) are quite typical of their class. They are generally similar to sherds from the two raths at Ballywillwill, Co. Down (Waterman, D. M., and Collins, A. E. P., 1952); to sherds from Lissue rath, Co. Antrim (Bersu, G., 1947); and from the Ballintoy caves, Co. Antrim (Gaffikin, M., 1934). All are from hand-made vessels which, to judge from fractures, were probably built on the coil principle. rhere is no clear evidence for the use of a slow wheel or turntable for finishing. Only one complete profile was recoverable (no. 6) but the rest, to judge from surviving sherds, werc all of this saucepan or bucket shape, with more or less straight sides, either vertical or splayed slightly outwards at the top, and with a flat base.

(nos. 2-5) cordons were frequently applied about 1 in. below the rim. The pot wall met the base either in a sharp angle (nos. 14, 16) or with a plain curved junction (no. 15), or with the addition of a very slight cordon (no. 17). While pot walls varied in thickness from I in. to 3 in., it was noteworthy that the bases tended to be disproportionately thin. All but two base sherds showed chaff impressions on their undersides, a feature commented on at BallywilIwill (Waterman, D. M., and Collins, A. E. P., 1952). Of the two exceptions, one showed a perfectly plain smooth base and the other (pl. VIII, no. 4) showed the impressions of both upper and lower surfaces of hazel leaves.* A very high proportion of all sherds were coated on one or both surfaces with a burnt sooty deposit, probably indicating use as cooking pots. The fabric of the sherds is closely similar to that of the Ballywillwill pots hard, well-fired ware containing a fair quantity of (usually) medium to fine grits. These last include pounded up burnt flint and small pieces of quartz, sometimes up to 3/16 in. across. Fine mica gleams in the surface of most sherds, probably as a natural constituent of the clay, rather than as an intentionally added gritting. The two wheel-turned sherds which may be continental imports are illustrated in pl. VIII. No. 3 is of extremely hard paste and shows clear rilling on the inside. The inner surface and about half the thickness of the sherd are white, while the outer half is blue-grey to black in colour, with a superficial colouring on the *Thanks are due to Miss P. M.

Evenly distributed through the paste is a fine gritting of white quartz, plus a few rounded coloured grainis, including one brick-red example similar to those seen in sherds of imported French medieval pottery from Clough Castle, Co. Down (Waterman, D. M., 1955). The gritting projects evenly through both inner and outer surfaces of the sherd, giving a fairly granular texture. No. 1 is an extremely thin sherd, just under i in. thick, of a brick-red paste that is homogeneous throughout. The inner surface shows marked rilling. Gritting is very fine and relatively sparse. It is composed of finely crushed quartz and very small plates of micai Both nos. 2 and 3 are from superficial levels. The complete crucible (fig. 12, no. 72) is of the normal pyranmidal form with triangular mouth as at Garranes (O,'Riordain, S. P., 1942, 134-9) and at Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, 235-40). The whole of the outside is glazed with a thin deposit of dross of red and green colours (for an analysis see Appendix 1). This crucible is from the surface soil, just on top of the stratum of burnt grain. Several pieces of other crucibles of this type also occurred, two of them at a considerable depth in the substructure of the crannog and indicated in the section (fig. 6). The medieval sherds (fig. 8, nos. 18-21) show both coarse and glazed wares. No. 18, a rim sherd in pinkish buff paste, bears a continuous olive-green glaze with darker brown mottlings on the outside. It is a rim sherd from a jug closely comparable with the complete jug from the site now in the National Museuyn, Dublin (Waterman, D. M., 1951, 112-3). It shows the frilled neck-band and much of the point of attachment of the strap-handle. This kind of jug occurs at Clough Castle, Downpatrick Motte, and Carrickfergus Castle, and is discussed in Ulster J. Archeol., 17, 129-30. No. 19 is a rim sherd of a hand-made cooking-pot in a hard grey fabric, full of medium-sized grits. It shows a lightly tooled decoration of crescentic impressions on the rim and just inside it. There are fairly close parallels at Clough Castle (Waterman, D. M., 1955), associated there with jugs similar to our no. 18. No. 20 is the profile of a rim sherd of another hand-made cooking-pot in dark grey ware, this time unornamented. No. 21 shows the profile of a rim sherd of a wheel-turned cooking-pot in pinkish-buff sandy paste with a grey core. One spot of brownish glaze shows in the neck below the rim. It is, in general, comparable with the series of wheel-thrown cooking-pots from Carrick fergus Castle (Waterman, D. M., 1951, 114) but matched perhaps more closely by sherds from early 13th century deposits at Castle Skreen Rath, 1l miles E. of Lough Faughan (excavation report by C. W. Dickinson forthcoming).* An un illustrated side-and-base sherd showing a convex base, is of similar fabric and could have come from the same pot. A sixth, also unillustrated, sherd is probably a fragment of a cooking-pot. The paste is full of medium-sized quartz grits and fired to a purplish colour, inside and out, and to the hardness of stoneware. It can be paralleled among sherds from Carrickfergus Castle. IThe Samian sherd is a fragment of a beaded rim, too small for certain attribution to any of the known forms. It was associated with Hearth 4 (fig. 5). Lough Faughan thus falls into line with such sites as Lagore, Ballinderry 2, and Island *Further work at this site in 1955 has produced a short-cross penny of John (1199-1216) or early Henry III (1216-18) from the same strata as these wheel-thrown sherds, thereby confirming the date given above (information by courtesy of Mr. C.

An explanation of such seemingly useless scraps in such late contexts has recently been put forward by Mr. C. A. Ralegh Radford.* A final item of baked clay is the almost complete mould for casting a bronze pin (no. 25). The pin cast in this would have had a flat head of thistle outline; it is a surface find. BRONZE. Relatively few recognisable pieces of bronze occurred, despite the evidence from crucibles and dross (see Appendix IV) and from a clay mould for bronze casting. The plain penannular brooch (fig. 9, no. 22) is a well-made example with flat expanded terminals and delicately-shaped stop-mouldings on the ends of the ring. It came from the upper occupation levels in Cutting 16. A larger, though otherwise closely comparable example came from Ballinderry no. I Crannog (Hencken, H. O'N., 1936, fig. 24d). While it is obviously allied to the much larger decorated brooches of this type, usually attributed to the 7th century A.D., this simple form could, as Hencken remarks, have had a longer life. The pin, no. 23, with a small portion of its ring head surviving was associated with no. 22. Whether its head was of annular or of penannular form it is impossible to say, though it appears to have been made of thin bronze wire, suggesting a light wire loop. The needle, no. 37a, from the main occupation level, seems to be an uncommon type from Early Christian sites. Another, with a more lozenge-shaped eye, comes from Garranes (O'Riordain, S. P., 1942, 98). The bronze key, no. 24, of a barrel-type padlock came from the upper structural levels of the crannog. It is hammered out of a flat strip of bronze and un ornamented. The working end is bent at right-angles and provided with a sub rectangular hole. Close parallels occurred at Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, fig. 20 and p. 80). The spring core from a barrel padlock, also in bronze, came from the same level as the wicker mat in Cutting 11 (pl. IV). IRON. The bulk of the iron objects recovered from the upper part of the occupation levels of the crannog were too badly corroded for cleaning to be risked and so disguised with blisters and accretions as to make identification difficult. Most of these doubtful specimens were probably knives or simple iron tools such as carpenters' bits for boring wood. Objects recovered from deeper occupation levels (especially from sticky clay strata) or from the peat and brushwood of the structural levels tended to be well preserved. Pins. The small pin (unstratified) with figure-of-eight head (no. 37) was made by ingenious looping of the end of a plain piece of iron wire, thus imitating the bronze form in which the end of the stem is cleft longitudinally and the two halves *He suggests that they may have been picked up by pilgrims on deserted Romnn sites abroad and served either as blessed relics from holy places or as raw material, perhaps for the inlay of shrines (information communicated in a lecture to the Prehistoric Society, September, 1954).

The double-looped iron pins from Cahercommaun are not an exact parallel. Knives. The two knives illustrated, both from upper occupation levels in Cutting 8, are typical of those normally met with in Early Christian sites in Ireland. The hollow cutting-edge of no. 65 is probably due to whetting. Shears. No. 67 shows a well-preserved pair of shears from the upper structural levels of Cutting 13. It is matched by others from Garranes, Lagore, and Cahercommaun. Axes. Of the two axes, no. 68 was unstratified and no. 71 from the lower occupation levels of Cutting 4. No. 68 is closely akin to the T-axes depicted as boat builders' tools in the Bayeux Tapestry (cf. Maclagan, E., 1943, 37-8). No. 71, also a tool, rather than a weapon, has very obviously been used as an axe-hammer, as the burring of the rectangular pane opposite the cutting-edge shows. Similar evidence of use as a hammer is seen in an axe from Cahercommaun (Hencken, H. O'N., 1938, fig. 31, no. 336). Scale-pan. A small circular iron pan from the peat of the structural levels is very closely matched by another from Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, fig. 46). Though no hooks or eyes for suspension are now noticeable, it seems reasonable to suggest that it served as a scale-pan (fig. 11, no. 69). Slotted and Pointed Object. The slotted and pointed object, no. 70 (unstratified), is matched by others from Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, fig. 33), from Cahercommaun (Hencken, H. O'N., 1938, fig. 32), and from Uisneach (MacAlister, R. A. S., and Praeger, R. Lloyd, 1929, 121, all in Ireland, and from Dunadd (Anderson, J., 1905, 318), in Scotland. Their use is obscure but they have variously been interpreted as sharpening irons (i.e., 'steels') and -as strike-a-lights.* Shield-boss. I am indebted to Mr. E. M. Jope, to whom no. 75 was given for cleaning) for its identification as a shield-boss, very like one from Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, fig. 33, no. 757). It is neatly hammered out of thin sheet iron with a markedly conical profile and narrow'flange for attachment to the shield, presumably by rivets. This find is from the base of the occupation levels, where it lay on wicker matting in Cutting 20. Unillustrated Iron Objects. These included: several knives comparable with nos. 64, 65, and 66; an iron ring 21 ins. in diameter, threaded through what may have been a smaller iron eye-perhaps part of a horse's bridle; an iron buckle with flat tongue and circular loop of flattened cross-section. BONE AND ANTLER. Pins. The bone pins were of simple type and all came from the occupation levels. No. 30 is perhaps unfinished, since all the facets of initial knife trimming are visible. The remainder are all finished and have pierced flattened heads. No. 32 is probably made from a pig fibula. Peg. The roughly hacked peg, no. 29, apparently of deer antler, has been notched round just below the head, perhaps to give a grip for attachment of a cord or tlhong. *Perhaps the steel counterpart of the flints discussed below (p. 69).</page><page sequence="18">62 A.

One of the side-plates of a double-sided comb, no. 38, showing rivet holes and three cuts made by the saw used in cutting the comb teeth, comes from a peat deposit in the structural levels (fig. 6). A flat piece of cut bone (unillustrated) from the occupation levels might be evidence for the manufacture of such combs on the site. Pendant. The pendant, no. 46, which has broken across the hole for suspension, is of ivory. I am indebted to Dr. T. K. Penniman, Curator of the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford, for its identification as the tip of a back tooth from a sperm whale. 'Toilet Articles.' The two pin-like objects of bone, nos. 35 and 36, are closely comparable with others from Lagore which Hencken has called 'toilet articles' on analogy with a Roman ear-scoop from London. The Lough Faughan examples seem to be the only others to have come to light with this distinctive kinked stem. Trhe head of no. 35, while only a featureless globe, is so set on the stem as to suggest the balance of a human head on its spine. No. 36 is even more clearly anthropomorphic, with a top suggesting the profile of a warrior's head with plumed helmet. Both have a very glossy, finely-finished surface. Both come from a depth of about 2 ft. in the occupation levels, no. 36 being adjacent to Hearth 4. Antler Cuttings. Several small sections of sawn antler, perhaps indicating waste from the manufacture of knife handles, occurred in peaty structural levels, near the centre of the crannog (fig. 5). Two other pieces occurred elsewhere in occupation levels-the tip of a tine, roughly sharpened to a square-sectioned point and a sawn-off crown end. All appear to be from red deer (Appendix I). GLASS. Beads. Half a dozen glass beads (nos. 39-44) were found, all either in the occupation levels or unstratified. All are plain-i.e., of a single colour. The commonest is a fairly dark translucent blue (no. 39, 40, and 41). As remarked in the Lagore Report (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, 133), this plain blue type is of little cultural or chronological significance, being found in both Celtic and Teutonic contexts and, indeed, from the Bronze Age onwards in Europe. No. 42 is part of a segmented bead or else of a dumb-bell bead with longitudinal perforation. It is of opaque white glass and is not matched in colour at Lagore, though the form is known there in blue glass, whether of two or more segments. No. 43 is an annular bead of clear white glass. No. 44 is of, an opaque yellow glass-a type as widespread in space and time as the plain blue one. Glass Vessel. A much burnt fragment 1/16 in. thick (unillustrated) of a small vessel of some kind in dark honey-coloured glass. Glass Armlet. A heat-damaged fragment (no. 45) of an armlet of deep blue glass, ornamented with three fused-on cables, came from an occupation level. Each of the cables appears to have been produced by twisting a single strand of white glass round a blue core. Unlike the Lagore armlets of this type, the cables are raised and not pressed in flush with the general surface of the armlet. In this respect they are more akin to examples from Roman Scotland and even from Jutish graves in Kent (Kilbride,Jones, H. E., 1938).</page><page sequence="27">64 A. E. P.

Four fragments of lignite bracelets showed cross-sections which varied from almost circular to sub-rectangular. One with almost a D-section is shown in no. 26. All are from the occupation levels. Finger-ring. Half of a finger-ring in lignite, with a D-section, is closely akin to Romano-British examples. AMBER. Beads. Fragments of two small, roughly discoidal beads came from the base of the main occupation levels. A large complete bead (unstratified) is illustrated in no. 28. This tends towards a cube in shape and has a perforation diagonally, from corner to corner. None showed any signs of careful trimming to any regular form. All may be perfectly natural chunks of amber which have been drilled for threading. WOOD. The conditions in the occupation levels of the crannog were seldom damp enough to preserve wood in recognisable form. Hence, nearly all the material available from the site is from the structural levels. As such it could be divided into material, such as pointed stakes, which was cut especially for use in the substructure of the crannog and 'second-hand' woodwork which included both parts of older structures (e.g., framework of vehicles, etc.) and smaller, purely domestic, implements and utensils which were either lost or intentionally thrown in to add to the bulk of the substructure. The structural woodwork included a fair amount of squared, dressed timbers with mortice holes. In most instances it was impossible to hazard a guess at their original function, yet certain of them were considered worthy of illustration (nos. 81-85). No. 81, a massive squared baulk of oak, pierced with five mortices and grooved along one edge, though undoubtedly on the heavy side, recalls the end members of the main frame of a southern English farm waggon. I am indebted to Mr. J. W. Y. Higgs, Curator of the Museum of English Rural Life, in the University of Reading, for his views on this suggestion. While he agrees that the timber could have formed one of the cross members of the bed of a waggon, he notes that most English 19th century examples show six mortices for the longi tudinal timbers, as opposed to four in the Lough Faughan example. He does not regard this as a vital discrepancy but points out the extreme length of the crannog example (5 ft. 3 ins.) as compared with English waggon members which range from 3 ft. 3 ins. to 4 ft. 5 ins., in the examples in his museum. Thus, he regards no. 81 as possibly, rather than probably, a waggon component. No. 82, a plank of oak, has neatly rebated edges, apparently designed to butt against similar planks on either edge. The large holes near each end of the plank still contained wooden pegs or dowels, also of oak. These and the reinforcing 'patch' of wood over the holes at the right-hand end are difficult to interpret. Mr. E. M. Jope has suggested that they may have been made not for dowels but to hold the ends of hurdling. If this suggestion is correct, the plank might, as he has pointed out, have been part of one end of the superstructure of a cart, whose sides were made of wicker, after the fashion of medieval farm carts depicted in manuscript miniatures.

The smaller mortice shows a groove on the illustrated face such as would accommodate a wedge driven through the projecting end of the corresponding tenon-a method of construction suited to the building of a frame which could be dismantled and reassembled as required. Such a method might well be applied to loom construction. No. 84 is a slotted timber of oak, of unknown function. No. 85 appears to be the blade end of an oak paddle which has snapped off; the hole is presumably connected with re-use of the piece. Paddles are of regular occurrence in crannogs, as at Ballinderry 1 (Hencken, H. O'N., 1936, fig. 8) and in Scottish crannogs (Munro, R., 1882, passimn). Definite evidence of wheeled vehicles is afforded by no. 86, a sketch reconstruction based on broken and badly warped fragments of half of a turned wheel hub, probably of ash, found adjacent to Hearth 3. The hub had broken through the centre of the mortices for the spokes. Although the complete circumference at this point was missing it seemed that the complete wheel possessed 12 spokes, as did the one from Newstead (Curle, J., 1911, 294) and another from Glastonbury (Bulleid, A., and Gray, H. St. G., 1911, vol. 1, 328). Our hub does not have the graceful outlines of either of these examples which show smooth sinuous curves, broken by slight beads on the hub proper. The outer end of the hub shows a slightly tapered profile, presumably to help retain an iron band. No traces of the fixing of such a band were seen. The tenons on the inner end of the spokes were of tectangular cross-section, as at Newstead, and unlike the round peg form of the Glastonbury wheel. Such a heavy wheel as our hub indicates seems far removed from the light, shapely wheels of war chariots and much more suited to agricultural uses. Among smaller wooden items are the hoop of yew wood, no. 87, whose two ends have been tapered, lapped and pegged together with wooden pegs. The diameter involved is too great for a normal stave bucket, so the piece is presumably from a barrel. The finely finished end of a stave, no. 77, in yew wood, with its neatly squared bottom and V-section groove for inserting the base, is presumably part of a stave bucket of about 14 in. diameter at the base. Eight similar buckets as well as smaller vessels constructed by the same methods came from Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, 152-3) and at least 15 stave-built vessels from Ballinderry no. 1 (Hencken, H. O'N., 1936, 129-30, 137, 141-2, 173-5). No. 76, in addition to the wheel-hub, provides evidence of wood turning. It is a much charred, unstratified fragment of a wooden bowl, without foot or foot-ring. The wood is alder. Lathe manufacture is shown by the four narrow concentric grooves on the outside. It is hazardous to attempt a reconstruction of the upper part of the vessel, but one with similar base, from Lagore (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, fig. 77, W3), shows a shallow form with slight carination below a tapered overted rim. No. 73 shows a very well made pointed wooden tool with a knob bearing foul notches at the top. It has been shaved into shape with hand tools and not turned Since it might be some kind of spindle for spinning, it was sent to Mr. R. Patterson. Curator of the York Castle Museum, whose Report follows this paper, p. 81.</page><page sequence="31">68 A. E. P. COLLINS 78 7 '8 FI G. 13. Granite quemstones (xi). No. 74 is a wooden object of unknown use. The eye at the upper end is presumably for attachment or suspension, like the eye on the end of a door-key shank. The working end is broken but appears to have extended asymmetrically to the left, as seen in the figure. It has been suggested, on modern analogies, that this may have been a thatching tool. STONE. Querns. Three large pieces and a few small burnt fragments of quern-stones were found in the upper occupation levels of the crannog. All were made of very coarse-grained granite. The three large pieces which are illustrated (nos. 78-80) include two parts (78 and 80) of upper stones with relatively large central holes to accommodate a wooden rynd or bridge-piece, and on e ee (79) of a completely perforated lower stone with small conical perforation right through it. These querns accord with others from Lagore, Ballinderry 2, Cahercommaun, etc., in showing descent from the Romano-British thin flat type of stone. Spindle Whorls. Four stone spindle whorls, of which two are illustrated (nos. 49 and 50) came from the upper occupation levels of the crannog. All are probably made from local stone, a fine-grained sandstone. All are unornamented and appear to have been made by grinding on surfaces and edges a disc which had been bored wpth a more or less cylindrical perforation at the centre. They can be matched locally at such sites as Ballywillwill (Waterman, D. M., and Collins, A. i:. P., 1952, fig. 6), at Castle Skreen, Co. Down (report by C. W. Dickinson forthcoming) and abundantly at such sites as Ballinderry no. 2 and Cahercommaun. They probably have no dating significance. It is perhaps worthy of note that no whorls in bone or other material came from Lough p eaughan. A larger, thinner, disc of slate with central perforation (no. 52) seems both too thin and too irregular in shape to have served as a whorl. The same objections apply to the thin slate disc, no. 51.</page><page sequence="32">LOUGH FAUGHAN CRANNOG 69 Discs with Two Perforations. Two complete (nos. 47 and 48) and one broken examples of thin slate discs, each with a pair of perforations, were found. They are difficult to match from other sites. It is possible that they were used in the twisting of two-ply thread of some kind, though, if this were their function, one would have thought that a more perfectly circular disc with a grooved edge would have been necessary to take a belt drive from another wheel. Heavy Stone Discs with Hour-glass Perforations. Two examples of these (nos. 55 and 58) are from the upper occupation levels. No. 55 is of a fine-grained sandstone and 58 of granite. The latter has one surface ground flat; since the grinding marks are not concentric with the perforation, it seems clear that this surface was produced prior to the drilling of the perforation. A likely explanation is that a piece of an ordinary quern-stone was used as raw material. Both these two discs are heavy enough to have served as loom-weights or net-sinkers. Imperforate Stone Discs. Two examples, one of which is illustrated (no. 53) are of a general class which has occurred in many Early Christian sites, including Garranes, Cahercommaun, and Lagore. The larger examples at these sites have given rise to speculation as to their use. No. 53 is probably to be interpreted as an unfinished disc of the type of no. 52. The larger, unillustrated, example is a broken piece of a disc originally 4 in. in diameter and 1 in. thick of greenish grey slate, ground flat or slightly hollow on both faces and roughly ground on the edges. It has clearly served as a slab on which material such as, perhaps, pigment has been ground, since the scratch-marks of a rotary grinding motion are to be seen on both faces. Perforated Whetstones. Two perforated whetstones, both from upper levels, are illustrated in nos. 56 and 57. No. 56 is of a medium to fine-grained red sandstone and no. 57 of a fine reddish-brown silt-stone. No. 56 has a V-sectioned groove running round just below the broken perforation, perhaps to secure a thong or other means of attachment after the perforation broke. Plain Whetstones. These were fairly abundant. Of 15 examples at least two had been made from long narrow pebbles of ovoid cross-section, perhaps obtained from the seashore. The rest were made from slivers of Silurian greywacke, of more or less rectangular cross-section. Some showed use of all four sides, others only one or two. None presents the narrow grooves noticed on whetstones from Lagore and interpreted as evidence for the sharpening of pins (Hencken, H. O'N., 1950, 177). A much-used illustrated example (no. 54) has a knob 'handle' formed of a hard quartz vein in the rock; the main roughnesses of the quartz have been ground quite smooth. This and several other whetstones were recovered from the peaty structural levels of the crannog. JWorked Flint. Some 50 pieces of flint were recovered from the occupation levels of the crannog. The majority of these were small, naturally fractured pieces showing much bruising on edges and angles, yet six were carefully flaked implements, including two end-scrapers (one illustrated as no. 64) and a leaf-shaped arrowhead (no. 62). All these three are of neolithic or Early Bronze Age aspect and are in sufficient to suggest that the manufacture of flint implements was carried on by the crannog inhabitants. The bruising of the edges of most of the flints (whether flaked or not), their concentration in and around the hearths (eleven came from the large</page><page sequence="33">70 A. E. P.

Such obvious implements as are included in the total are more likely to have been brought in as raw material for strike-a-lights than to be evidence of the manufacture of, say, scrapers in Early Christian times. DIscusSION. While it is to be feared that the excavations of 1951 and 1952 were inadequate to reveal the structural side of the crannog, the relative abundance of small finds and the apparently one-period occupation of the site (ignoring for the moment the stone revetted levelling of the top) have presented us with a fairly complete series of small finds which can be regarded as broadly contemporaneous. While no striking ornamented metalwork or other fairly closely datable material is included, the parallels in minor small finds with those from Lagore crannog are quite remarkable. In attempting to date the occupation of the site we are without the advantages of documentation and good ornamented metalwork enjoyed at Lagore. At first sight the numerous parallels between our small finds and the Lagore material allows us to equate the two sites in date. Yet the occupation of Lagore spread over a consider able period-from mid 7th to late 10th centuries A.D. And closer inspection of our links with the Lagore material makes it clear that we cannot limit the Lough Faughan occupation to any part of this period. The small finds in question range over the whole of the three phases into which Hencken divides the Lagore occupation. Thus, our figured objects nos. 39-41 range over the whole period at Lagore. Nos. 73 and 76 have parallels in Lagore la, no. 69 in Lagore lb, no. 70 in Lagore 2 and no. 36 in Lagore 3. The period of currency of all these objects is quite unknown. Lough Faughan may have had an equally long period of occupation or, alternatively, a much shorter one within the Lagore date limits. rhe Lagore occupation period is so long that it is unlikely that we are faced with substantially earlier or later material at Lough Faughan. A feature shared by Lough Faughan with other crannogs is the inclusion of domestic refuse in the structural level of the site. '[his implies at least one pre existing domestic site within reach of Lough Faughan. As examples we need only cite the second-hand woodwork, discussed above, and the great quantities of animal hones thrown into the structuiral levels. While all such material could have come from any of the neighbouring raths, it is possible that the crannog by Ballyrolly old church, a mile to the E. of Lough Faughan, stands in this parental relationship to our site. The agriculture basic to the economy can be inferred from the domestic animal bones (Appendix 3), from the evidence for a heavy wheeled cart and from the spread of burnt grain and chaff over the site. Utilisation of agricultural produce is shown by the rotary querns and the wooden distaff (pp. 68, 81) probably used in the preparation of wool for spinning. The evidences for metallurgy and metalworking on the site closely parallel those from Lagore. Iron ore, slag and part of a bloom all testify to iron working on the site. The only recognisable ironwork found was purely of a domestic and agricultural character; no weapons except the shield-boss were included. It seems likely that these implements were made on the spot. In this respect the site differs greatly F</page><page sequence="35">72 A. E. P. COLLINS from Lagore, a royal residence where, as one would expect, weapons of many types were found. Turning to work in other metals, we have no evidence of gold or silver,* or even gilt bronze. One complete crucible from the occupation levels and pieces of others in both structural and occupation horizons, slag and dross from the production of bronze and a clay mould for pin casting, all point to bronze working as an important industry on the site. A detailed analysis of slags, etc., from metal working is given in Appendix 1. Some of the numerous hearths no doubt were for the reduction of ores and the melting of metals for casting, rather than for domestic fires. The evidence, then, as at Lagore, points to a community with a many-sided economy centred on the crannog. The farmlands on which it depended probably extended for some distance round the lough. The wood, bone and other organic materials could have been produced locally, probably from the same lands. Perhaps only the ores for metalworking and a little of the pottery need have been imported from a distance. This diversity of activities within a basically self-sufficient economy seems to imply a community larger than the family unit which one would assume to have occupied a rath. Yet the site is so small that it is difficult to see how accommodation could have been found for more than a single family within its bounds. While no identifiable house structure was found, we may perhaps cite the parallel of Ballinderry no. 1 crannog, Co. Westmeath, where a well-preserved and completely excavated site possessed in its heyday a single central house some 40 to 50 ft. in diameter. The abundance of pottery at Lough Faughan is in striking contrast to the sites (both raths and crannogs) in the Irish Midlands, where the only pottery normally met with is the stray sherd of continental origin. Lough Faughan crannog produced types and quantities of pottery exactly comparable with what has been found in east Ulster raths and souterrains. That pottery was not used to the exclusion of vessels of other materials is shown by the turned wooden bowl and the bucket staves. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

ANALYSIS OF SLAGS AND OTHER MATERIAL FROM LOUGH FAUGHAN CRANNOG by BRUCE PROUDFOOT Nuffield Quatemary Research Group, Queen's University, Belfast The results of spectrographic analyses of samples from the crannog at Lough Faughan, Co.

Only partial qualitative measurements were obtained using carbon arc technique, but an attempt has been made to indicate the relative amounts of the same element present in each sample.</page><page sequence="37">74 A.

Incorporated in the sample are several small fragments of bone highly calcined. Analysis indicated the presence of tin and lead in the sample and traces of copper but the latter may have been due to copper in the carbon electrodes. Magnesium was present in greater amounts than in other samples. Sample B. Probably originally soil and occupation debris containing hazel nuts, charcoal, etc., altered by fairly intense heating and by mixing with hot smelting refuse of low density similar to sample A. The sample is vesicular and rather flaky in texture, generally black or brown in colour. Copper and manganese were indicated by arc spectra. The black colour may be accounted for by Mn. compounds and the brown colour is probably due very largely to iron oxides. Samples C-E. TFhese samples were all taken from a large mass of greyish-yellow material with a green-grey vesicular layer covering part of the surface. This "skin" was vitreous on the exterior and resembled the shell found on the outer surface of a crucible from the same site (sample G). The greyish-yellow material is probably clay altered by contact with molten metal or molten slag perhaps over flowing from a crucible during smelting operations. The skin (sample E) contained appreciably more copper than the rest of the material (yellow clay C, grey clay D) while tin was found in all samples. Traces of lead were present in all samples. It is likely that this material was clay specially prepared for use in metal-working (p1. VIII, no. 2). Samples F-G. Sample F was taken from the thin wall of a crucible while sample G was taken from the vesicular outer shell covering the crucible. Although the shell appears to be vesicular in section and grey in colour, its outer surface is vitreous, and a rich plum-red colour. The outer face of the crucible is similarly coloured. Copper and tin were present in both the crucible and the shell. This latter probably consists for the most part of a mixture of tin and copper, metallic oxides and dross which overflowed down the side of the crucible during the preparation of bronze in the crucible. It would appear from the relatively large amounts of copper and tin present in the sample taken from the crucible wall that the clay walls of the crucible "take up" considerable amounts of metal during metal working operations (pl. VIII, no. 2).</page><page sequence="38">LOUGH FAUGHAN CRANNOG 75 Sample H (no spectrographic analyses carried out). The matrix of this sample is a yellowish-brown vesicular mass of low density and high pore-space. Although structurally stable this matrix can be easily crumbled between the fingers to give a very fine yellowish powder. Included in it are small fragments of charcoal and burnt bone, as well as some small grits-of quartz, of very weathered sandstone (?), and of a blackish rock. A green-grey vesicular layer covers part of the surface as in samples C-E (pl. VIII, no. 6). Under low-power microscopic examination it can be seen that some of the black grits have been altered by intense heating. It seems probable that the blackish coloured rock is derived from the Silurian and there is no evidence to suggest that any of the grits are other than could be derived from the local drift. The presence of charcoal and bone in the sample indicates that the alteration of the black grits did not take place in the sample, so that they are presumably from elsewhere on the site. Detailed examination of the structure of the sample indicates that there are two types of cavities in the material. The great majority of these cavities are extremely small (0.1 mm.) and circular in plan, but a few larger cavities tend towards a figure7of-eight plan and are considerably deeper than the others. These large cavities, unlike the smaller, seem to be smooth inside and to be coated with a thin film of, perhaps, clay. It is suggested that the sample is a mass of ash from a hearth or midden, more likely the latter, as this would more satisfactorily explain the inclusion of highly altered rock fragments with scarcely changed organic material. The vesicular nature of the sample is probably due to hot gases having been blown through the ashy material as a viscous slag was poured over the surface. The ashy matrix has probably been stabilised by the deposition of salts (mainly iron) and minute quantities of clay from percolating ground water. Specimens of bog iron ore, iron slag and iron blooms from the site have also been examined, and it is hoped to carry out analyses of these at a later date. I am indebted to Mr. Stuart McConaghy of the Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Queen's University, Belfast, for providing facilities for carrying out this work and for much helpful discussion. APPENDIX 2. CARBONISED GRAIN FROM LOUGH FAUGHAN CRANNOG by MICHAEL E. S. MORRISON Nuffield Quatemary Research Group, Queen's University, Belfast A sample of carbonised material from Lough Faughan, Co. Down, was submitted for examination. After separating ash, and broken pieces of wood-charcoal, a considerable quantity of cereal-type material was isolated. It was possible to separate this into two lots; the majority consisting of oats (Avena spp.) along with a much smaller fraction made up of barley (Hordeum sp.) (pl. IX).</page><page sequence="39">76 A. E. P. COLLINS None of the oats showed the complete "flower" preserved. The bulk of the material consisted of naked grains but there was a small number of grains retaining the lower portions of the glumes. The upper part of the glumes was missing in every case. The material may be referred to the Avena sativa type on the evidence of the structure of the lower part of the "flower" although several "flowers" definitely identifiable with Avena. fatua L. (Wild Oats) were isolated. The length, breadth, and thickness of the naked grains, together with their strongly convex sides, suggest that they also may be attributed to the Avena sativa group. The measurements given below correspond with those given by Jessen and Helbaek in their 1944 "Cereals" paper.l OATS. SIZE OF CARBONISED GRAINS.* Number Length mm. Breadth mm. Thickness mm.

Mi. 20 ... 4.9 6.0 4.0 ... 1.9 2.0 1.7 ... 1.7 2.0 1.5 ... 2.6 2.9 The material of barley was unmistakable and several of the "flowers" had part of the terminal serrated awn preserved. Again naked grain was present; the proportions of naked and hulled material being about equal. Unfortunately no internodes were present so that the species of barley could not be determined. Jessen and Helbaek (1944),l and Helbaek (1952),2 have noted the absence of evidence of oats from Ireland in prehistoric times, so that the present find together with Mitchell's find of Avena strigosa from the rath site at Ballinjarry Downs3 constitute the first records of prehistoric oats from Ireland. Oats were known in England from Early Iron, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon periods; in Scotland from the Roman period. It is interesting to note the preponderance of oats in this sample from an Early Christian site. This may be taken to indicate that the plant was deliberately cultivated here at this time and was not an accidental. Jessen and Helbaek (1944) considered that oats did not become an independent crop in Britain before the Roman era. *Where remains of the radicle was preserved it was not included in the measure of the length.

THE ANIMAL REMAINS by MARGARET JOPE The animal remains from the crannog are considered in three groups: those from the structural levels lying underneath the habitation, those from the habitation levels themselves, and a miscellaneous group from the upper habitation levels which contained medieval material. The remains from all three groups were similar in character and in content; material from the structural levels was fairly well preserved, that from the other two deposits was in rather bad condition. The bones were almost entirely those of domestic animals, ox, pig, sheep, horse, domestic fowl; the only wild animal was red deer, which was represented in all three groups by small numbers of antler fragments and bones. The only remains of fish from the whole site was one bone from the habitation levels. Ox was by far the most numerous animal present, accounting for 63.8% of the total bones, pig bones amounted to 24.5%, sheep to 9.7%, and red deer to 1.2%. The percentages were remarkably similar when worked out for each of the three groups of deposits separately, which suggests a stable agricultural economy over a considerable period. Closely similar results were obtained when the percentages were worked out from the approximate number of animals as assessed from the overall study of the bones. These animals were found in similar proportions at Ballinderry Crannogs 1 and 2 (Proc. Roy. Irish A cad., 43C (1936), 234; 47C (1942), 68); at Lagore, ox represented an even higher proportion of the animals present (Proc. Roy. Irish Acad., 53C (1950), 226). rhe small number of red deer bones suggests that deer formed no significant item in the diet; the antler fragments, many of which were cut, presumably for making implements, could have been collected as shed antlers. Horse occurred in the habitation levels but only as two bones from which it was not possible to deduce any data as to age or size. The only bird bones from the site were five bones of a large domestic fowl, occurring in the habitation levels. Measurements show that they are slightly larger than the bones from a modern 63 lb. capon. The good-sized spurs on the tarsometatarsals suggest that it was kept as a fighting cock. Such spurs, presumably developed for fighting, have been observed on the fowl bones at Lagore Crannog (7th-lOth centuries) and on the larger variety of fowl found in Britain on Roman sites, but not earlier (D. M. A. Bate in C. F. C. Hawkes and M. R. Hull, Camulodunum (Colchester), Soc. Antiq. Lond. Res. Rep. XIV (1947), 355; Archcwol. J., 102 (for 1945, pubd. 1947), 102). This larger breed of fowl, with spurs developed for fighting, has not so far been observed on pagan Saxon sites in Britain, though records of bird remains from such sites are sadly few. These Lough Faughan tarsometatarsals with spurs are considerably larger than any of those from the Saxon town of Thetford (8th-Ilth centuries) or those from the Saxon site at Old Windsor, Berkshire (Yth-lith centuries), Table V. It is, therefore, of some interest to find this particular feature of Romano-British life on these Early Christian sites in Ireland. It adds a new facet to the numerous aspects of technology and cultural life of the Roman world which appear in Ireland in the Early Christian period. Lagore was a royal site, and such amusements might have</page><page sequence="41">78 A. E. P. COLLINS been expected; these spurs on the Lough Faughan fowl may perhaps enhance the status of this crannog, and at any rate suggests that its inhabitants had some leisure time. The ox bones from all three groups showed small- or medium-sized animals as well as large beasts, a distinction between cows and bulls. The horn cores were of the longifrons breed. There were several bones of young animals from the structural and habitation levels and one bone from the structural levels of an animal not more than a few weeks old. The evidence from the teeth suggested that there were no animals of any great age: none of the teeth showed very much wear. Many of the mandibles and skull fragments showed the 3rd molar not fully erupted. In modern breeds this tooth erupts at about 2-21 years, but in less highly bred stock it might not occur until the animal was even older. One mandible had the Ist and 2nd molars just erupting, suggesting an animal of perhaps 2 years. Several of the mandibles carried a deciduous 3rd premolar, indicating animals of less than 24-3 years by modern standards. The pig bones were of a more slender build than modern breeds, suggesting the more active and long-legged "greyhound" pig found on early sites in Ireland and which was the common breed here until- after the Middle Ages. There was no evidence of young animals from any of the levels and the teeth showed no great amount of wear such as might be expected from an old animal. The 3rd molars were frequently not fully erupted, indicating animals of 11 to 2 years. The sheep horn cores were of the Soay type, and the bones themselves suggested this breed. There was no evidence of young sheep. There was no positive evidence of goat. The only fish bone from the site came from the habitation levels and was a branchiostegal ray of a marine gadid, probably cod. This indicates that the in habitants of the crannog were able to draw to some extent upon the products of off-shore fishing, which must evidently have been going on round these coasts during the Dark Ages and of which we have had up till now little positive archwological evidence from Irish sites (N. Antrim, J. G. D. Clark, Prehistoric Europe (1952), 85; Outer Hebrides, Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot., 71 (1937), 359-60). This scarcity of fish bones is also observed at three other major excavations of crannogs of this period. At Ballinderry Crannog No. I no fish, at all, were recorded; three unidentified fish bones were noted at both Ballinderry Crannog No. 2 and at Lagore. The proportions of the different bones of the various animals do not suggest deliberate selection of any particular cut of meat except that the number of pig mandibles in the miscellaneous levels is fairly high, as also observed in the 14th century Bridge Pit filling at Carrickfergus Castle (Ulster J. Archceol., 15 (1952), 116), where it was considered that salted pork chaps might have been imported for the garrison. Occurring here as they do mainly in the upper levels of the crannog, the possibility of their having been brought on as salt joints may also be considered here. It must be remembered that meat was frequently salted down for the winter for which certain joints would have been selected and that any such portions taken on journeys would mean that certain bones were selectively removed from the site.

PATTERSON Castle Museum, York THE wooden object (no. 73) from the Lough Faughan Crannog is very similar to others from the Lagore Crannogl where they are described as spindles, but this interpretation is open to doubt. To be used as spindles for spinning it would be desirable to have provision for the attachment of a whorl, and whilst it is possible in the Lough Faughan example</page><page sequence="45">82 R. PATTERSON to slip a whorl over the stem to rest on the head this is not possible in the Lagore examples where the stem is of greater diameter than the head. Even if a whorl is assumed to have been attached to the head, or if the object is regarded as a heavy spindle used without a whorl, it is still impossible to spin as the steep slope of the pointed end does not permit the attachment of the yarn by looping it around. Alternatively the spindle could be considered with a whorl forced on to the pointed end and suspended from the head, but in this case the point is too steep to provide a secure attachment for the whorl and the yarn would suspend the spindle so far from its axis as to produce an eccentric motion unsuitable for spinning. Experiments carried out with the Lough Faughan example confirm these views, and it is probable that these objects are not spindles but hand distaffs. Hand distaffs were used by the Greeks and Romans and are illustrated as late as the 9th century in Italy.2 Most of these distaffs are apparently of wood about 9 or 10 inches in length, but one vase painting3 depicts a shorter hand distaff comparable to the crannog examples. Spinning with a hand distaff differs fundamentally from the more familiar technique of the waist or under arm distaff. With the latter the yarn is spun direct from the prepared fibres whilst with a hand distaff a loosely spun fore-yarn or rove is essential. This rove was prepared in classical times by rolling the fibres by hand either along the bare leg or on an onos or hollow tile shaped to fit over the knee.4 The rove was then wound around the distaff or wound into a ball and pushed on to the distaff, and spinning was accomplished by rotating the suspended spindle with the right hand and allowing the rove on the distaff in the left hand to be drawn out and twisted into yarn. The Lough Faughan example when used as a hand distaff functioned satisfactorily. A second type of hand distaff is probably represented by other 'spindles' from Lagore Crannog5 and Ballinderry Crannog No. 2.6 These are double-ended with a central carved or turned collar, and would be unsuitable as spindles for the whorl would presumably be attached against the collar and would thus render half the spindle ineffective. The square-section collar in the Ballinderry example is not consistent with a whorl attachment. With a whorl forced on to either end of the spindle the central collar, and particularly the square one, would be an obstacle to the winding of the yarn. The length and form of these objects agree with the illustrations of Greek and Roman hand distaffs, with one end to hold the rove and the other to serve as a handle. There can be little doubt that these objects represent two forms of hand distaffs, and it is interesting to find these survivals of Roman types in the crannogs. References. 1. Hencken, H.
