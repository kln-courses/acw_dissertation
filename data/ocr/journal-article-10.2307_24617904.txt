Site fidelity to breeding and wintering grounds, and even stopover sites, suggests that passerines are capable of accurate navigation during their annual migrations. Geolocator-based studies are beginning to demonstrate precise population-specific migratory routes and even some interannual consistency in individual routes. Displacement studies of birds have shown that at least adult birds are capable of goal-oriented movements, likely involving some type of map or geographic position system. In contrast, juveniles on their first migration use a clock-and-compass orientation strategy, with limited knowledge about locations along their migratory routes. Positioning information could come from a variety of cues including visual, olfactory, acoustic, and geomagnetic sources. How information from these systems is integrated and used for avian navigation has yet to be fully articulated. In this review, we (1) define geographic positioning and distinguish the types of navigational strategies that birds could use for orientation, (2) describe sensory cues available to birds for geographic positioning, (3) review the evidence for geographic positioning in birds and methods used to collect that evidence, and (4) discuss ways ornithologists, particularly field ornithologists, can contribute to and advance our knowledge of the navigational abilities of birds. Few studies of avian orientation and navigation mechanisms have been conducted in the Western Hemisphere. To fully understand migratory systems in the Western Hemisphere and develop better conservation policies, information about the orientation and navigation mechanisms used by specific species needs to be integrated with other aspects of their migration ecology and biology. RESUMEN. Navegación en aves y posicionamiento geográfico Fidelidad con las localidades de reproducción y zonas de migración e incluso sitios de parada, sugiere que los Passeriformes tienen habilidades de navegación precisa durante las migraciones anuales. Estudios basados en geolocalizadores están comenzando a demostrar, rutas precisas especificas para las poblaciones, e inclusive alguna consistencia interanual en rutas individuales. Estudios de desplazamiento han demostrado que por lo menos aves adultas tienen la habilidad de realizar movimientos orientados hacia los objetivos, probablemente involucrando algún tipo de mapa o sistema de posicionamiento geográfico. En contraste, aves juveniles en su primera etapa de migración usan una estrategia de orientación basada en reloj y compás, con conocimiento limitado acerca de las localidades a lo largo de las rutas de migración. La información sobre el posicionamiento puede provenir de una variedad de señales incluyendo fuentes visuales, olfatorias, acústicas y geomagnéticas. Sin embargo, todavía no ha sido completamente articulado la forma en la cual estos sistemas son integrados y utilizados para la navegación en aves. En esta revisión, (1) definimos el posicionamiento geográfico y diferenciamos entre tipos de estrategias de navegación que las aves potencialmente usan para la orientación, (2) describimos las señales sensoriales disponibles para las aves para el posicionamiento geográfico, (3) hacemos una revisión de la evidencia existente para el posicionamiento global en aves y los métodos utilizados para colectar esta evidencia, y (4) discutimos algunas formas de cómo los ornitólogos, particularmente ornitólogos de campo, pueden contribuir y promover nuestro conocimiento sobre las habilidades de navegación en las aves. En el hemisferio Occidental, se han realizado pocos estudios de orientación en aves y mecanismos de navegación. Para comprender completamente los sistemas de migración en el hemisferio Occidental y desarrollar mejores políticas de conservación, necesitamos integrar la información acerca de los mecanismos de orientación y navegación utilizados por especies especificas, con otros aspectos de la ecología de la migración y biología. Key words: map-based navigation, migration, orientation, passerines, sensory cues The navigational and migration feats of birds have often been considered among the most spectacular examples of such behaviors, with some species even migrating between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres (Bairlein et al. 2012). These abiiities are even more astounding when exhibited by a songbird with a brain the size of a marble. Our understanding of how birds accomplish migration and their navi gational capabilities remains fairly rudimentary. We know birds possess the sensory abilities to extract directional information from a range of physical cues in the environment (e.g., visual, ol factory, and magnetic). We also know birds pos sess at least two types of compass mechanisms, 3Corresponding author.

Field Omithoi. a magnetic compass and a celestial compass, that provide them with references to maintain a directional heading during migration. Although compass orientation is fairly well documented in birds and a variety of other organisms, how they determine which direction to fly to reach their goal is not. Juvenile birds likely inherit knowledge of a basic species-specific (Gwinner and Wiltschko 1978, Helbiget al. 1989, Helbig 1996) or even population-specific (Bearhop et al. 2005, Thorup et al. 2007) migratory direction, whereas adults are clearly capable of modifying their direction to improve navigation accuracy (Moore 1984, Thorup et al. 2003, Schiffner and Wiltschko 2013). Speculation about the ability of organisms to fix their ge ographic position has resulted in a variety of studies that suggest birds can determine their position during migration and, in some cases, compensate for unwanted displacement during flight (Akesson 1993, Karlsson et al. 2010). This "map sense" or geographic-positioning sense is poorly understood. Even the sensory cues that birds might use for positioning are disputed (Wiltschko et al. 1987a, b, Gagliardo et al. 2013, Kishkinev et al. 2013), and the ways in which birds might use positioning information are unresolved. Our objectives in this review are to (1) define geographic positioning and distinguish the types of navigational strategies that birds could use for orientation, (2) review the sensory cues available to birds for geo graphic positioning, (3) evaluate the evidence for geographic positioning in birds, including methods used to collect that evidence, and (4) discuss ways ornithologists, particularly field ornithologists, can contribute to and advance our knowledge of the navigational abilities of birds. Although other reviews of avian naviga tion can be found elsewhere (e.g., Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2003, 2009, Holland 2014), our objective is to stimulate new research on species and at locations in the Americas that could benefit conservation efforts. Although the prin ciples we discuss potentially apply to all birds (and, in some cases, other non-avian species), our primary focus is on passerines. Experiments on Rock Pigeon (CoLumba livid) homing, in particular, have often influenced the direction of research on songbird orientation and navigation (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2003, 2009, Walraff 2005). Here we mention research results based on other avian species, such as pigeons, seabirds, and raptors, to illustrate biological mechanisms and the potential capabilities that might be available to passerines as well. NAVIGATION STRATEGIES True navigation is based on location-specific information and requires an animal to deter mine its geographic position relative to a goal and plot a course toward that goal without use of familiar landmarks, goal-emanating cues, or information from an "outbound" journey (Griffin 1952). The ability to orient toward a goal is based on a bird's ability to detect and process information from geophysical cues. Although day-to-day navigation by birds is thought to be based predominantly on visual cues or landmarks (Holland 2003), navigation associated with long-distance homing and mi gration is more challenging because it requires travel through unfamiliar regions that would lie outside a known, regional visual map. Therefore, long-distance, true navigation likely involves more global geophysical cues, such as the Earth's magnetic field. Compass orientation, commonly used by many animals, involves maintaining a constant bearing relative to the compass cue, such as magnetic North or Polaris, and alone does not provide information about position along an animal's path, for example, heading due south without knowledge of one's position. A com pass mechanism alone can be used for vector navigation, which involves steering a sequence of directional bearings to arrive at a goal. The timing and the sequence of vector navigation may be determined endogenously or by external cues. Vector navigation is common in juvenile songbirds and will be discussed later. However, true navigation in birds, as envisioned by Kramer (1953, 1957) and many subsequent researchers, involves the use of a compass and map (Fig. 1), analogous to human navigation. The map pro vides the information for geographic position ing, which is necessary for true navigation. For bicoordinate map-based navigation, a bird would need to perceive nonparallel gra dients of two or more geophysical features to determine its position relative to a goal to return to a familiar area following displace ment (Fig. 2; Wallraff 1991, Phillips 1996,</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 113 Visual Information Information Celestial Cues Axial Compass Terrestrial Cues Local Features E-W Declination Gradient Landscape Features Magnetic Gradient Map Landmark Map Olfactory Information, Acoustic Information, Positioning . System , Compass System Geographic Variation N-S Inclination &amp; Intensity Gradients Fig. 1. Map-and-compass model of avian navigation showing the potential roles of various types of sensory information described in the text. The avian compass system uses input from the geomagnetic field, specifically magnetic inclination to determine poleward and equatorward directions, and multiple sources of celestial input (e.g., polarized light cues and stars) to determine geographic North. The map or position system likely involves both regional and local features, which could include visual, acoustic, olfactory, and geomagnetic inputs. Phillips et al. 2006). Although the axes do not need to be precisely N—S and E—W, the rotation of the Earth makes the N—S axis a logical, natural reference. The second axis does not need to be perpendicular to the first, but must be independent of and nonparallel to the first, thus, approximately E—W. Furthermore, the information sources for the two axes do not need to be based on the same physical phenomenon. To select its direction of travel, a bird would need to compare the bicoordinate values at its location with the bicoordinate values at its destination (Phillips 1996). This type of navigation requires that the bird have visited its destination previously or that it inherited those values. Moreover, although it may be logical (or at least anthropomorphic) to assume that birds would determine their bicoordinate position using map-based navigation, some species may only have a unicoordinate map. Such a map might only provide information about latitude (Mouritsen 2003). It is also possible that birds may have a "limited" map that can only be used when they are able to perceive known cues in a region where they have had previous experi ence (Perdeck 1967). Birds could use significant landmarks, or waypoints in GPS vernacular, as "sign posts" to assess or determine their specific location along a known or inherited migratory path. Visually, such a mechanism might be a series of rivers, lakes, mountains, and so on. In other sensory modalities, it might be a series of specific intensities of one or more cues. Three other alternative navigation strategies are possible that do not involve a sense of geo graphic position or map. First, birds could use significant landmarks or landscape features for local piloting. Piloting is a common navigation technique used by human pilots (air and water) who can navigate by triangulating their position using a series of visual landmarks. To do so precisely requires that an individual be within contact of at least three of these landmarks at all times or two landmarks combined with a compass reference (Gould and Gould 2012). Second, birds could also orient relative to a single cue that creates a sensory gradient, as do some Procellariforms (Nevitt 1999). A bird</page><page sequence="4">114 M. E. Deutschlander and R. C.

Example of two non-perpendicular cues that could be used by birds for regional bicoordinate navigation. In this example, the roughly vertical lines (labeled with letters) could represent the azimuth of magnetic North and the roughly horizontal lines (labeled with numbers) could represent either the intensity of an odor emanating from the south or the intensity of the geomagnetic field. could move directly towards an omnidirectional source (known as positive taxis) or move at a fixed angle relative to the source. The source could be at or near the goal of orientation (goal emanating) or serve as a landmark along the migratory path. Either way, this would not be considered true navigation as defined by Griffin (1952). Moving directly toward a source, for example, infrasound from a mountain pass or a particular odorant source, would involve follow ing a gradient of increasing amplitude. In theory, a bird could also orient by moving directly away from a source (negative taxis), but this would be more difficult because any direction within 90° of directly away would result in decreasing amplitude. If the direction of the source could</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 115 be localized independent of its intensity changes, any fixed angle could be used to orient relative to the source. The source could then be used for an orientation task such as piloting; this would allow a bird to navigate to a location within the detection range of the source. Finally, inertial navigation, or dead reckoning, involves internally keeping track of changes in direction and the length of each leg of journey to compute a location relative to the origin of the journey. Rock Pigeons might use such a mechanism to determine a "short-cut" return trip to their home loft using path integration based on the outward journey (Toegel and Wiltschko 1992). Although this may be common over short distances for some animals, its use for migration is unlikely because errors in computing location compound with distance and drift (e.g., caused by wind). SENSORY CUES AVAILABLE FOR GEOGRAPHIC POSITIONING Sensory cues used by birds for compass in formation are relatively well characterized. The predominant compass mechanism used by ex perienced, adult pigeons is a time-compensated sun-compass (Schmidt-Koenig et al. 1991, Wallraff 2005). The sun compass might be used by songbirds for orientation during non migratory daytime movements (Able and Dillon 1977) or by diurnal migrants such as European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (Schmidt-Koenig et al. 1991). However, most songbirds migrate at night, beginning near sunset and ending by sunrise. Determining the position of the sun is, therefore, implausible during most of the time passerines migrate, except at the beginning of each nightly flight (Moore 1978, 1980b, Phillips and Moore 1992). Multiple sources of compass information have been proposed and tested for use by nocturnal migrants, includ ing sunset glow, polarized light patterns, stellar patterns, and the geomagnetic field (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1995a, 2009). Moreover, spectral patterns (Coemans et al. 1994) and patterns of polarized light (Brines and Gould 1982, Able and Able, 1993, 1996, Muheim et al. 2006, 2009) in the sky around sunrise and sunset could be important cues to derive the sun's position when it is out of sight. Muheim et al. (2006) and Wiltschko and Wiltschko (2009) recently reviewed compass mechanisms, ontogeny, and interrelationships. With respect to position information, birds have demonstrated behavioral and physiological responses to the intensity and orientation of sev eral naturally occurring geophysical cues (Fig. 1). Such responses can be used to test hypotheses regarding the use of various cues for map-based navigation. One challenge researchers must keep in mind is that birds do not appear to rely exclusively on a single sensory cue for orientation (Walcott 2005). They are opportunistic and use the information available to them (Wiltschko et al. 1987a, b, Able and Able 1996) so isolating the role of a single sensory cue can be difficult. Birds also "calibrate" multiple types of sensory cues, such as magnetic and celestial compass cues, with one another (Able and Able 1996, Muheim et al. 2009). Thus, if a primary refer ence is unusable under specific conditions, a sec ondary source, based on information transferred from the first cue, can be utilized. Calibration of celestial and magnetic compass information is critical for birds because magnetic North and geographic North are not at the same location, leading to an angular disparity (known as magnetic declination—discussed below) be tween these two types of compass references (Muheim et al. 2003, Akesson et al. 2005). Thus, for birds to properly orient in regions with a large declination, they must resolve the angular disparity and calibrate one compass with another. Celestial polarization patterns at sunrise and sunset appear to be a calibration source for the magnetic compass in many species (Muheim et al. 2006, 2007, 2009). Visual information. How birds use visual information to determine position, and the types of visual cues they use, depends on the distance from their objective or the scale of the orientation task. Birds certainly use visual cues to orient during their daily activities (e.g., foraging) and to return to a nest, territory, or roost (e.g., Holland 2003). Probably the best documented cases of landmark use for posi tioning in a bird's home range are the food storing capabilities of caching birds, such as Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; Sherry and Duff 1996) and homing by pigeons (Wallraff 2005), both of which indicate a role of the hippocampus in "landmark memory" and local positioning (Sherry and Duff 1996, White et al. 2002, Bingman et al. 2005). Visual sources of information, both terrestrial land mark cues and celestial cues, are also used during</page><page sequence="6">116 M. E. Deutschlander and R. C. Beason j. Field Omithoi. larger-scale, migratory navigation (Fig. 1). Al though humans can generally relate to the use of visual cues in spatial tasks, several as pects of avian vision differ from human vision (Beason 2012). For example, spectral sensitivity in most songbirds extends from the ultraviolet to the deep red, they likely have more acute color vision, and some species appear capable of discriminating differences in the celestial polarization pattern of ambient light. If they can determine the angle of polarization for the skylight, birds could extrapolate the location of the sun even when it is hidden behind clouds or they could use the polarization patterns at sunrise and/or sunset to determine geographic North (Muheim et al. 2006). Therefore, caution must be used in making hypotheses and assump tions about visual sensitivity and perception of birds. On a local scale, trees, clearings, and rock outcroppings might serve as visual navigation cues to locate a nest, roost, or food source. Such landmarks could serve as the basis for a cognitive spatial map. However, there is little evidence that birds use visual landmarks for spatial navigation other than in the immediate vicinity of their home and other familiar locations (Wallraffet al. 1999, Brio et al. 2004). Pigeons and some other avian species show lower visual field myopia (near-sightedness), an adaptation for feeding (Erichsen et al. 1989, Hodos and Erichsen 1990). As a result, the terrain and landmarks below the horizon are likely out of focus when a bird is flying. This configuration results in birds being more sensitive to objects on or above the horizon than below it. Thus, although it seems visual landmarks provide important information about location and direction, birds may limit their use to short-distance references (Balda and Turek 1984, Bunch and Tomback 1986, Herz et al. 1994). Terrestrial, visual cues for long-distance ori entation most obviously include distinct land scape or topographic features, such as coastlines (Fig. 1). Large topographic landmarks could serve as a compass-like guide, and mountain ranges, large bodies of water, coastlines, and other large geographic features are known to influence migration and orientation in passer ines (Alerstam and Petterson 1977, Bruderer 1982, Bruderer and Jenni 1988, Bruderer and Liechti 1998, Diehl et al. 2003) and raptors (Kerlinger 1989, Brandes and Ombalski 2004, Thorup et al. 2006, Katzner et al. 2012). The coasts of the Americas lay generally N-S and could serve as a leading line providing compass information for birds. Moreover, the shores of the Great Lakes and northern Gulf of Mexico run E—W and, like point sources, could serve as waypoints helping with latitudinal positioning. Because most songbirds migrate at night, these terrestrial features may be most useful during crepuscular hours. However, the sound of surf crashing on the shore may also be used by birds to identify their position (discussed below). Although celestial cues are important for compass orientation, their role in providing positioning information during long-distance migration is less certain. Although latitude can be determined based on stars visible at specific times of the night or the maximum altitude of the sun during the day, longitude cannot (Kishkinev et al. 2010, Holland 2014). Furthermore, songbirds appear to use stellar cues in a time-independent manner, which would not allow them to predict the expected altitudes of star patterns (Emlen 1967a, b, Mouritsen and Larsen 2001). Magnetic declina tion determined by a combination of input from a celestial and magnetic compass, theoretically, could be used for determining longitude (see later). However, there is no indication that birds use celestial compass cues alone for determining their location. Olfactory information. Rock Pigeons can use airborne chemical cues to aid in nav igation for homing (Wallraff 2005, Bingman et al. 2006). Odors have been proposed to provide location information and perhaps a gradient a bird could follow to its home loft, and a debate over the role of olfactory cues in a "gradient" or "mosaic" map component of navi gation has continued among pigeon researchers for decades (e.g., Able 1996, Wallraff 1996, Wiltschko 1996, Mora et al. 2004, Phillips et al. 2006). For example, Jorge et al. (2009) reported that site-specific odors did not pro vide navigational map information, but instead "activated" an independent non-olfactory map system. In addition, some species of seabirds use odors to locate food sources, their nesting burrows, or conspecifics (Nevitt 1999, 2008, Debose and Nevitt 2008, Nevitt et al. 2008, Gagliardo et al. 2013). Although they have a moderately well-developed sense of smell (Clark et al. 1993), there is currently little evidence</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and. Geographic Positioning 117 that migratory passerines use olfactory cues for navigation (Bingman and Cheng 2005, Holland et al. 2009). Any use of atmospheric airborne cues though is likely limited to relatively short distances (50-100 km) (Wallraff and Andreae 2000, Bingman et al. 2006) and would therefore not be useful over the range of most passerine migration (Fig. 1). Acoustic information. Avian hearing is similar to that of mammals. The avian hear ing range is mostly restricted to frequencies between 100 Hz and 10-20 kHz (Beason 2004), although Rock Pigeons, Capercaille (Tetrao urogallus), and a few other species can detect infrasound (&lt;20 Hz; Kreithen and Quine 1979, Schemurly and Klinke 1990). Airborne birds can hear clearly and respond to sounds from the ground; these sounds include water crashing on shores, rivers, and other natural and human-produced sounds (Griffin and Hopkins 1976), as well as the calls of other birds (Mukhin et al. 2008). Most sound sources are highly localized (attenuate within short distances) and of limited use for long distance navigation. One exception might be the sound of waves on coastal shorelines, which produce auditory and infrasound frequencies (Arrowsmith and Hedlin 2005). "Hearing" a coast could be as effective as seeing a coast for orientation (see above), and could be a bet ter sensory system for coastal detection during nocturnal flights for most migrants. Acoustic detection of the coast at night might also allow a bird to determine that it has drifted out over the ocean and reorient back toward land. However, low frequency sounds, and partic ularly infrasound, cannot be localized easily. Like mammals, birds use the disparity of sound properties (i.e., intensity and timing differences) reaching their two ears to localize sound. The long wavelength of infrasound (&gt;100 m) and the small size of a bird's head (cm) make de tecting interaural differences, particularly related to timing, unlikely. One approach might be to determine the Doppler shift or intensity changes as a bird flies in a circle as pigeons often do when taking off (Quine and Kreithen 1981, Hagstrum 2000). Thus, a bird could use a single source of infrasound as a landmark or a reference point (Fig. 1). With multiple sources at different frequencies, a bird could triangulate its location; in other words, pilot using acoustic cues. Geomagnetic information. Several fea tures of the geomagnetic field make it suitable for use as a navigation cue, especially regional, spatial changes in intensity and inclination (Figs. 1, 3). From the equator to the poles, magnetic intensity varies from ~30 to 60 |xT and the angle of inclination increases from 0° to 90° (Fig. 3). Although these changes can be generalized globally, the magnetic field is not uniform; there are numerous anomalies caused by variations in the Earth's crust that produce regional variation. Magnetic anomalies are loca tions where one or more aspects of the geomag netic field do not follow the global gradients such as those shown in Figure 3. This means the type of navigation possible based on geomagnetic cues may differ regionally (Bostrom et al. 2012). In regions where both geomagnetic intensity and inclination vary primarily along a N—S axis, such as across the southern portion of North America (Bostrom et al. 2012), these cues may provide only unicoordinate information limited to latitude (Mouritsen 2003). A bicoordinate map based on the geomagnetic field would require that an animal perceive two compo nents of the magnetic field that vary geograph ically and that the two gradients be nonpar allel (Moore 1980a, Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1995a, Phillips 1996). Gradients in geomagnetic intensity and inclination are not parallel to each other in several regions (including parts of Europe and North America) making bico ordinate geomagnetic navigation theoretically feasible where two parameters of the magnetic field are at least a few degrees from being parallel (Bostrom et al. 2012). The only magnetic vari able that varies consistently along an E—W axis is magnetic declination, the angular disparity between geographic and magnetic North. In theory, birds have the potential to determine declination using their celestial and magnetic compasses (Fig. 1). However, whether they use declination as a position variable is untested. At least two potential magnetoreception sys tems usable for orientation have been reported in birds: (1) an iron-oxide-based mechanism asso ciated with the ophthalmic branch of the trigem inal nerve (VI), and (2) a light-dependent, radical pair-based mechanism (Ritz et al. 2000) located in the retina of the eye (Deutschlander et al. 1999, Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2007, Mouritsen and Hore 2012). The latter mech anism appears to be involved only in providing</page><page sequence="8">118 M. E. Deutschlander and R. C. Beason j. Field Omithoi. Fig. 3. The relationship between the total intensity of the geomagnetic field (white lines) and the inclination angle of the total field relative to the Earth's surface (gray lines). In many regions of the world, the gradients or patterns of these two parameters vary in similar ways. However, they vary at angles to one another elsewhere, and at those locations could theoretically be used for bicoordinate navigation (Bostrom et al. 2012). The inclination isoclines are in 20° increments and the total field intensity is in 5000 nanotesla (nT) increments. Source: World Magnetic Map 2000, U.S. Geological Survey, geomag.usgs.gov. compass information (Zapka et al. 2009). Mag netic compass orientation of both juvenile and adult birds is affected by both wavelength and intensity of light (Wiltschko et al. 1993, 2003b, Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1995b, Muheim et al. 2002), and may be lateralized to the right eye in some species (Wiltschko et al. 2002b, 2003a, Rogers et al. 2008, but see Hein et al. 2011). Disruption of compass orientation by low-amplitude radio-frequency fields implicates a light-driven biochemical process involving rad ical pair intermediates (Ritz et al. 2004, Thalau et al. 2005), likely cryptochrome molecules in the retina (Mouritsen et al. 2004), perhaps the ultraviolet/violet cones where the photopigment Cryptochrome la (Cryla) has been reported (Niefiner et al. 2011). The avian optic tectum has been shown to contain neurons directionally sensitive to magnetic fields (Semm et al. 1984, Beason and Semm 1987), and the forebrain (i.e., Cluster N) is involved directly in magnetic com pass orientation (Mouritsen et al. 2005, Heyers et al. 2007, Zapka et al. 2009). In contrast, an iron-based mechanism innervated by VI provides adult birds with magnetic information other than compass direction, potentially pro viding the basis for a magnetic positioning sense (Mouritsen and Hore 2012, Kishkinev et al. 2013, Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2013). When birds are exposed to a strong magnetic pulse designed to remagnetize permanently magnetic particles, such as magnetite, a change in the direction of migratory orientation is observed in adults (Wiltschko et al. 1994, 1998, Beason et al. 1995, 2002a, Holland 2010), but only when VI is intact (Beason and Semm 1996). Pulse remagnetization does not influence the compass sense of adults (Beason and Semm 1996, Wiltschko et al. 2006). Likewise, juveniles captured prior to their first migration, which should not have a developed map sense, are unaf fected by this treatment (Munro et al. 1997a, b, Holland and Helm 2013). Target areas of VI in the brainstem are magnetically sensitive (Heyers et al. 2010), and V1 neurons exhibit the requisite sensitivity to small magnetic field changes that would be required for precise geographic po sitioning (Beason and Semm 1987, Semm and Beason 1990, Beason 2005). Magnetite deposits have also been reported from the ethmoidal turbinates of birds, which is innervated by VI (Walcott et al. 1979, Wheeler 1990, Beason 2005). Potential magnetic receptors associated with VI have been described (Fleissner et al.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 119 2003, Falkenberg et al 2010), but these findings are not without criticism (Treiber et al. 2012). Although much has been learned about the elu sive magnetic sense of birds, definitive receptors for either system of magnetoreception have yet to be identified. METHODS FOR STUDYING BIRD NAVIGATION One of the oldest methods for understand ing bird migration and movements is banding. Banding birds can only provide information about individual orientation and navigation when banded birds are recovered after their migration or dispersal. When caught at other locations during the same migratory season or year, rudimentary information about migratory paths can be implied, that is, movement between two locations is obvious, but the precise path between two locations cannot be determined. When recaptured at original banding sites in subsequent seasons or years, information about site and route philopatry can be assumed (e.g., individuals use the same stopover sites in subse quent migrations). Banding can be combined with experimental displacements of birds to provide information about the ability of birds to compensate for displacement during migration; this involves recapturing banded birds that were taken to a distant location and subsequently re leased. When analyzing band returns, however, investigators must keep in mind that report ing rates are influenced by human population density, infrastructure, and public awareness of the value of reporting band recoveries (Perdeck 1967, Mewaldt et al. 1973). A classic banding and displacement study of migratory European Starlings by Perdeck (1958) is still one of the most cited refer ences for evidence of map-based navigation by adult migrants. During autumn, thousands of starlings were captured along their migratory route in the Netherlands, banded, and displaced southward to Switzerland. Adults were recov ered in their usual population-specific winter ing areas in northern France, indicating that they had corrected for the geographic dis placement. Juveniles were recaptured southwest of their population-specific wintering grounds (i.e., Spain), showing that juveniles continued to orient in a fixed compass direction without compensation. Releasing wild-caught birds can provide more information about orientation and navigation abilities when combined with other methods. Researchers studying homing pigeons often track the paths of their subjects by examining vanishing bearings of birds (the direction in which the bird was last seen heading, usually de termined visually with binoculars) from specific release sites relative to their home loft. Vanishing bearings can also be determined for migratory birds released during the night by marking birds with chemiluminescent products. Mouritsen and Larsen (1998) displaced and released young Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleucd) at various locations in Europe during autumn migration. By recording the vanishing bearings of birds marked with lightsticks (Cyalume Technolo gies, West Springfield, MA, USA), they found that juveniles oriented consistently in a south southwest direction without compensation for displacement. Even more information can be gained from released birds when combined with telemetry or tracking devices. For example, using telemetry tracking of thrushes, Cochran (1987) reported that the birds tended to fly in a straight path early on their migration, but were more goal-oriented toward the end of the trip. Although radio, satellite, or cellular technologies have been used for tracking birds, radio-telemetry is currently the only technology miniaturized sufficiently for use with passerines (Bridge et al. 2011). Radio telemetry can be used to track the local move ments of birds around breeding areas or stopover habitats; orientation paths in the area can be assessed with arrays of monitoring stations. Last known coordinates can be used to provide more accurate "vanishing bearings" for birds departing on migration. The resolution and accuracy of telemetry devices for migratory songbirds are at best good to within ~100 m of the receiver (Bridge et al 2011). Thorup et al. (2007) displaced migratory White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrysgambelli) ~3700 km east from Washington state to New Jersey, released the birds, and followed their initial routes using telemetry, ground vehicles, and aircraft. Like Perdeck's (1958) starlings, only adult migratory White-crowned Sparrows compensated for this displacement and ultimately headed almost due west. Although telemetry can provide informa tion on the route followed by a bird during its migratory trip, such tracking is time-consuming</page><page sequence="10">120 M. E. Dentschlander and R. C. Beason j. Field Ornithol. and requires that researchers constantly monitor the bird. GPS-based dataloggers have been used to determine precise tracks birds follow after being displaced. These devices have been most succes sively used on Rock Pigeons because they require recapturing the birds to download the data (von Hiinerbein et al. 2000). New hardware allows downloading data without recapturing a bird, but the researcher must be relatively close to do so (Bridge et al. 2011). More recently, cell-phone technology has been developed that reports a bird's position or track through a commercial carrier to the researcher. Because of the size of all these devices, their use is restricted to birds that weigh at least 300 g (Ledesma GPS BIRD Tracker). They have been used to determine that soaring raptors track along specific ridgelines where they benefit the most from updrafts caused by the topography (Katzner et al. 2012). Geolocators are the newest and smallest tech nology providing information about bird move ments (McKinnon et al. 2013). The operation and use of these devices have been reviewed elsewhere (Bridge et al. 2013). Deployment of geolocators in a plethora of studies has begun to provide new information about avian migration and navigation. In particular, geolocators pro vide rather precise latitude information about the locations of birds at any given time in the previous year, thereby providing the most specific information to date about individual migratory paths and stopover and wintering sites. For example, Stutchbury et al. (2009) tracked the southward and northward migratory paths of Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) and Purple Martins {Progne siibis) and found individual variation in the paths taken. Some birds crossed the Gulf of Mexico, but others flew through Mexico around the Gulf. Having precise information about the paths and loca tions of individuals from specific populations of birds will be useful to researchers examining the navigation mechanisms of birds (see later). However, as with other devices, geolocators can have negative impacts on birds in terms of survival and a carryover effect on reproduction (Arit et al. 2013). The most common experimental technique for examining orientation in migrants, particu larly passerines, is the use of orientation cages to examine directional preferences. The most com mon cage design, based on Emlen and Emlen (1966), is a cone- or funnel-shaped cage, with a small-diameter bottom, large-diameter top, and sloping sides (Figs. 4A and B). When placed in the funnel during migration, birds hop onto the side of the funnel in an attempt to escape. To determine possible directional preferences, bird movements can be monitored and assessed with video surveillance (e.g., Beck and Wiltschko 1983, Mouritsen et al. 2009, Muheim et al. 2014), or the funnel can be lined with some type of recording paper (e.g., blank newspaper with an ink pad, typewriter correction paper, or thermal paper) that is marked by each hop of the bird (Figs. 4C and D). Electronic versions and funnels with mechanical switches have also been used in some studies (Wiltschko 1974, Muheim et al. 2002, Mouritsen and Larsen 2001). Orientation cages are used with captive birds that can either be held long-term (over a season or full year) or short-term (just over a few hours). Length of captivity is determined largely by the question being addressed and the availability of birds for testing. For example, birds tested the same evening of capture and released the next day have revealed that the expression of migratory orientation is condition-dependent; leaner birds tend not to orient in the expected migratory direction for a given season, whereas fatter birds show seasonally appropriate orienta tion (e.g., Akesson et al. 1996, Deutschlander and Muheim 2009). In contrast, birds held for longer periods can be used to assess the sensory basis of orientation or navigation mechanisms. For example, studies using captive birds and Emlen-iike funnels have shown that birds rely at least partially on magnetic cues for deter mining geographic position. In captivity, the magnetic field a bird experiences can be altered using magnetic coils (Beason and Nichols 1984, Kirschvink 1992); not only can the direction of the magnetic field be altered to show that birds have a magnetic compass (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1995a), but other more subtle charac teristics of the magnetic field, such as intensity and inclination, can be changed to show that birds are influenced by regional variation in the Earth's magnetic field (Beason 1992, Wiltschko and Wiltschko 1992). The orientation of adult Lesser Whitethroats (Sylvia curraca-, Henshaw et al. 2010) and Australia Silvereyes (Zosterops I. lateralis-, Fischer et al. 2003) in funnel cages was found to be influenced by magnetically sim ulated geographic displacements beyond their</page><page sequence="11">vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 121 Fig. 4.

In Australia Silvereyes, this effect has been shown to be limited to only adult birds (Deutschlander et al. 2012). These results are again consistent with the premise that adults are goal-oriented and juveniles use compass or vector navigation (see below for further details). New technologies are being developed con tinuously that can be adapted or used directly to monitor the movements of free-flying birds during migration. Other technologies, such as satellite-based Platform Transmitting Terminal (PTT) tags and GPS-PTT devices are being further miniaturized and should soon be suitable for mounting on songbirds (Bridge et al. 2011). EVIDENCE FOR POSITIONING IN BIRDS: WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT PASSERINE NAVIGATION Adult birds can exhibit precise naviga tional accuracy between at least two sites (e.g., breeding and non-breeding) &gt;1000 km apart. Most field ornithologists are aware of the ability of individual adult migrants to return to the same breeding sites, and even same nesting locations, year after year (Sokolov 1997). Indeed, return rates of banded birds are used to determine site fidelity at breeding sites (Gavin and Bollinger 1988, Bollinger and Gavin 1989) and wintering sites (Cuadrado 1992), and to</page><page sequence="12">122 M. E. Deutschlander and R. C. Season j. Field Omithoi. estimate mortality rates of migrants (Sillett and Holmes 2002). Annual returns of long distance migrants are relatively high, estimated at 40%— 60% for males at breeding sites and 45% 60% for both sexes at wintering sites. When mortality rates are considered, almost 100% of surviving adult migrants of some species return to within 1 km2 of breeding and wintering locations used the previous year (Mouritsen 2003). For other species, especially juveniles, return rates are lower (Sokolov 1997). Stopover site fidelity has also been documented in sev eral species (Cantos and Tellena 1994, Merom et al. 2000) showing that birds can navigate to specific goals en route in addition to their target end goals of both autumn and spring migration. The migration of adult passerines, therefore, must include goal-oriented navigation based on a rather precise positioning system, which can produce narrow migratory paths (Willemous et al. 2014). This system likely includes an orientation strategy of map-based navigation, which includes "homing" to several locations along their migratory route. Birds are able to follow precise migratory routes during migration. Unlike documen tation of site fidelity, information about the spe cific migratory paths of individuals (or even pop ulations) has been limited because of a lack of appropriate technology to monitor individuals over multiple migrations until recently. Orien tation studies of caged migrants in the laboratory or semifield conditions have revealed population specificity in migratory direction. For exam ple, hand-raised populations of German and Austrian Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla:) orient in different directions during autumn migration, indicating they have inherited differences in orientation preferences that lead to different routes around the Mediterranean Sea (Helbig 1996). The migratory paths of juveniles (and presumably adults) of some species may also be influenced by inherited information about key locations (or "sign posts") along the migra tory route (Beck and Wiltschko 1988, Fransson et al. 2001, Kullberg et al. 2007, Chernetsov et al. 2008b, Henshaw et al. 2008). Geolocation studies provide the most promise for determin ing population-specific migratory routes and individual repeatability of migration paths, or route philopatry. The few data collected to date suggest there is population-specific variation in migratory paths, even among geographically close populations (Delmore et al. 2012), and individuals are capable of population-specific route philopatry (Stanley et al. 2012, Willemous et al. 2014). Like Blackcaps, the population specific routes of Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) are influenced by geographic features that create a "migratory divide." Inland and coastal Swainson's Thrushes from populations &lt;300 km apart in British Columbia, Canada, follow different migratory routes and target different wintering sites (Fig. 5) (Delmore et al. 2012); coastal features and mountain ranges likely influence the migration routes used by these birds. Geolocation studies, of course, in volve capturing tagged individuals after a round trip migration. Demonstrating route philopatry requires recapturing individuals with geoloca tors after at least two round trips, which is not an easy or even likely task. Stanley et al. (2012) found that seven of 10 Wood Thrushes tracked in multiple years exhibited at least some consistency in their spring migration routes. Adult birds appear to determine their position relative to their goal and adjust their path accordingly. Geographic dis placements studies with adult birds during mi gration consistently show that individuals that have made at least one migratory journey are capable of reorientation, suggesting they are following a goal-oriented navigation strategy (Akesson 2003, Mouritsen 2003). Orientation of captive individuals and recoveries of banded birds show that adults change direction consis tent with compensation for natural and experi mental displacement and can reach a goal after displacement. Data obtained in several ways, including tracking studies, orientation-cage ex periments, and banding recoveries, have demon strated that adult birds can readily compensate for both N—S displacements and E—W displace ments (Mewaldt 1964, Akesson et al. 2005, Thorup et al. 2007, Chernetsov et al. 2008a, Kishkinev et al. 2010, but see Riippell 1944, Perdeck 1967, Mewaldt 1973). Therefore, some species may be capable of bicoordinate naviga tion, whereas others may only be capable of com pensating for N-S position displacement and use landmarks to determine their E—W position (Mouritsen 2003, Deutschlander et al. 2012). Adult and juvenile navigation strategies can differ. Adult birds can compensate for positional displacement to an unfamiliar area during migration and, thus, are capable of</page><page sequence="13">vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 123 Fig. 5. Population-specific migratory paths of two populations of Swainson's Thrushes with breeding ranges near each other in southern British Columbia, Canada. Drawn from data in Delmore et al. (2012). true navigation. However, in most displacement studies, young birds on their first southward migration do not compensate for displacement (but see Akesson et al. 2005, Thorup and Rabol 2007). Orientation and banding recoveries of juveniles in most species studied to date are consistent with vector navigation based on a clock-and-compass strategy. In this strategy, birds fly a specific distance, based on how long they migrate, and in a predetermined direction, respectively. Both the time (distance) and direc tion of flight are innate (Gwinner and Wiltschko 1978, Berthold 1991, Helbig 1996, Mouritsen 1998, Mouritsen and Mouritsen 2000). How ever, the actual path followed by juvenile birds can be influenced by landscape features and other geophysical factors (Beck and Wiltschko 1988, Thorup and Rabol 2001, Chernetsov et al. 2008b). Juvenile birds on their first autumn migration begin to acquire position-specific in formation about their migratory route for future trips. In fact, displacement studies of juvenile birds during their first spring migration, and recovery of young birds at their natal site after their first spring's migration, suggest that young birds orient toward their natal sites as their goal during their northward migration (Perdeck 1958, Mouritsen 2003, Chernetsov 2008a), at least if the displacement is not too great (Perdeck 1967). Although experimentally induced displacements are used to test hypotheses about navigation, natural displacements occur from wind drift. Responses of adult and juvenile birds to wind drift suggest similar navigation mechanisms as displacement studies (Thorup et al. 2003, Liechti 2006).</page><page sequence="14">124 M. E. Deutschlander and R. C. Beason j. Field Omithoi. Geographic North Magnetic North Magnetic declination g 180' -150' Fig. 6. (A) The declination of the geomagnetic field is the angular difference between the directions toward magnetic North and geographic North; declination is positive when magnetic North is east of geographic North as shown here, and negative when it is to the west of geographic North. This difference results because the magnetic North Pole is not located at the geographic North Pole. (B) Because the magnetic North Pole is located in northern North America, declination varies primarily along an E-W axis and is not correlated with parameters of the geomagnetic field (intensity, azimuth, and inclination). Isoclines are in 5° increments (Source: World magnetic map 2000, U.S. Geological Survey, geomag.usgs.gov).</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 125 Birds appear to use multiple cues to de termine some aspect(s) of their position. Experiments designed to determine the sensory cues used by passerines for positioning show that adult birds can respond to slight variation in some component of the Earth's magnetic field (e.g., inclination and intensity; Fischer et al. 2003, Henshaw et al. 2010), and that variation affects something other than the bird's compass sense (Deutschlander et al. 2012). Moreover, some species respond to specific val ues ot the geomagnetic intensity or inclination to indicate locations where they should shift compass directions (Beck and Wiltschko 1988, Chernetsov et al. 2008b) or extend stopover duration to refuel and fatten (Fransson et al. 2001, Kullberg et al. 2007, Henshaw et al. 2008). Thus, passerines are apparently able to determine their location based on characteristics of the geomagnetic field along their migratory route. The trigeminal nerve (or VI), which has been implicated in carrying magnetic informa tion (see above), has also been found to be necessary for displacement compensation in at least one migratory species, the Eurasian Reed Warbler (Acrocephalusscirpaceus\ Kishkinev et al. 2013). However, although magnetic intensity and inclination offer potential cues about lati tude in most regions of the Earth, they vary little with longitude in several regions (Bostrom et al. 2012). Globally, magnetic declination (Fig. 6) could be a reliable indicator of longitudinal position (see above), but whether birds are able to determine the difference between the Earth's rotational axis and the location of the magnetic poles to use magnetic declination is currently unknown. Other sensory cues that might provide posi tioning information remain largely unexplored in passerines (see above), but such positioning likely involves more than magnetic cues and more than one navigation strategy. Variation in the results of studies investigating orientation by passerines also suggests that navigation strategies likely differ between species or even popula tions. These differences might be attributed to geographic region, migratory routes, or other aspects of migration such as seasonal timing. Moreover, pigeons and migratory birds often have redundant orientation mechanisms and are facultative in their use of environmental cues for orientation and navigation (discussed above). Consequently, an individual's strategy could vary depending on the reliability of cues available at a specific time or in a specific region along its migratory route (e.g., high vs. low latitudes). INTEGRATING NAVIGATION RESEARCH, FIELD RESEARCH, AND AVIAN CONSERVATION A better understanding of how North Amer ican songbirds navigate not only helps us com prehend their awe-inspiring feats, but also pro vides information that can be used to guide conservation efforts. To date, research on song bird navigation capabilities and mechanisms in the Americas has been limited to a few species and fewer mechanisms (Table 1). Advances in tracking and telemetry technology not only provide new opportunities for describing mi gratory routes and non-breeding sites, but can also be used to address several questions about navigation mechanisms (Thorup et al. 2010, Guilford et al. 2011). Knowing the specific goals of individual birds and their populations will give us a better sense of the navigational capabilities, needs, and constraints of birds. For example, we now know that, for many species, migration is not just a journey between two locations, but that there are many en route goals, such as key stopover sites, and even movement between multiple wintering habitats or sites (e.g., Marra 2000, Akesson et al. 2012, McKinnon et al. 2013). Populations with high site fidelity and strong migratory connectivity would be ideal for geographic positioning studies. Knowledge of the precise goals of populations and individual birds will allow researchers to more accurately evaluate the results of orientation tests with those birds. For example, better tests of the magnetic-map hypothesis can be developed with more precise information about the magnetic field values associated with migratory goals. Likewise, using knowledge of specific goals (breeding and win tering sites), the orientation of birds captured and tested at stopover locations can be assessed relative to a known goal to determine the in fluence of the bird's physical and physiological conditions, as well as environmental factors, on their navigational choices. Conversely, we can use results from orien tation and navigation studies to project the</page><page sequence="16">126 M. E. Deutschlander and R. C. Beason j. Field Omithoi. Table 1.

Simulation models of ori entation strategies for populations of birds can predict their location(s) during migration (Mouritsen 1998, Mouritsen and Mouritsen 2000, Thorup and Rab0l 2001). This infor mation can then be used to project where to employ banding or geolocator studies that will provide a finer (although still relatively coarse) resolution of locations. Subsequent research can be focused on fine-scale resolution of locations and movements, perhaps with radio-telemetry. Ultimately, knowledge of the orientation and navigation mechanisms of specific populations of songbirds and their intermediate and ultimate goals can likely be used to help select habitats and sites for conservation efforts. To wisely choose specific locations, we need to understand the migration patterns of species and populations, and the variation and plasticity of migratory mechanisms. For example, knowing that some stopover locations may be genetically encoded in certain species could influence decisions about conservation or restoration of key habitats. We could use information about the navigation abil ities and goals of specific populations of birds to help establish priorities concerning conservation of breeding and stopover locations in North America and wintering grounds in the Americas (including the Caribbean). There are many opportunities for field or nithologists to contribute to our knowledge of avian navigation. Use of new tracking tech nologies, such as geolocators, with additional</page><page sequence="17">Vol. 85, No. 2 Avian Navigation and Geographic Positioning 127 populations and species will help create a much richer picture of migratory routes and capabili ties. Knowing the variation in migratory routes between and within populations, route repeata bility or interannual consistency of routes, the number and locations of stopover and winter sites, and philopatry to these routes and sites are all key to providing a clearer understanding of avian navigation. Supplementing geoloca tion/telemetry studies with orientation tests of individuals (in orientation cages) at different locations along a migration route could trans form a descriptive study of migratory routes into a mechanistic study, particularly if combined with sensory or physiological research. Research is needed to elucidate the sensory cues and systems birds use to determine their location and whether location information is determined in an absolute sense (analogous to latitude and longitude) or relative to a goal. Lastly, displace ment studies, either real or simulated, of North American birds are rare. Studies conducted in key regions of North, Central, and South Amer ica could provide insight into the positioning capabilities of migrants (Bostrom et al. 2012).
