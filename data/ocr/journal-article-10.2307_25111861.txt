<plain_text><page sequence="1">I "Like Narrow Banners for Some Gathering War": Readers, Aesthetics, and Gwendolyn Brooks's "The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith" Ann Folwell Stanford Stanford is an assistant professor at the School for New Learning, DePaul University. She has just completed a book-length study of Gwendolyn Brooks's early poetry and is currently working on a project that examines the interplay of disease and health in black women's novels. Whites are not going to understand what is happening in black litera ture today. Even those who want to sympathize with it are still not equipped to be proper critics. (Brooks, Report 137) 1. "SATIN-LEGS" AND WHITE READERS n interviews, articles, and autobiography, Gwendolyn Brooks has consistently maintained her belief in the inability of white critics to understand the poetry of black Americans. At best, white critics bring a misguided interest (curiosity) and lack of true empathy to the poems; at worst, a rigid aesthetic against which the work of black poets is harshly and blindly, or paternalistically, judged. Contradict ing the commonly held view that her early (pre-'60s) poetry is less powerful, less politicized than her later work, Brooks's "The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith," which appears in her 1945 volume, A Street in Bronzeville,1 forcefully confronts the problem of unsympathetic and uncomprehending readers by writing an implied reader, one I shall call a reader/critic, directly into the text. My choice of terms here is strictly arbitrary; the reader/critic could just as easily be denoted the "student," the "observer," the "critic," or simply the "reader." However, because 162</page><page sequence="2">Ann Folwell Stanford 163 of the character's need for instruction, because the character is assigned such a passive role within the poem, and because of the character's implied disapproval (or limited understanding), "reader/critic" seems more accurate and descriptive. In the dynamic between the narrator of the poem and the reader/critic, Brooks critiques and revises an aesthetics predicated on the assumption of white Euro-American superiority. Besides challenging white aesthetics, "Satin-Legs" also instructs its white and/or resisting readers. Positioned as the midpoint of Bronze ville, the poem functions as a textual map for negotiating the perhaps alien path (for an "alien" reader) through the land and lives of Bronzeville. Further, Brooks couches both critique and instruction in warnings about a gathering cultural and political revolution. Problems arise, of course, with the assumption that what is of interest in a poem by a black writer is what that poem has to say to white readers. And in fact, such an assertion would be reductive and patently untrue. But it is the case that in the '40s and '50s, the readership for poetry would have been primarily white (and male), with the exception being other black writers, and perhaps students and faculty at historically black colleges. Before the 1960s, those declaring their attention to Brooks would be a large number of whites and a small number of blacks. The whites . . . would express interest in the universal and a disinclination to read about problems. From many, there would also be unstated premises or doubts regarding the blacks' humanity outside special exotic categories. Thus the question, Is your work about Negroness or about the human condi tion? would suggest unstated premises. (Kent, "Aesthetic Values" 38) This is not to say that Brooks wrote "for" white readers. On the contrary, the subject matter of her poetry grounds itself in the multiple voices and visions of black people. Carefully inscribed in those voices, however, is a resistance to the assumptions, prejudices, and values white readers would bring to her poetry. It is precisely this resistance that "Satin-Legs" dramatizes in both content and structure. 2. DISMANTLING AND CORRECTING ASSUMPTIONS: THE NARRATOR AND THE READER/CRITIC On the face of it, "Satin-Legs" appears to be a poem about a day in the life of a flamboyant, perhaps pathetic, but possibly quietly heroic urban black man. Critics have variously described the poem as "a poignant and hour by hour page out of a zoot suiter's life" ("Songs and Funeral Chants" 16), as a "parodie challenge to T. S. Eliot's dispirited anti-hero J. Alfred Prufrock" (G. Smith 36), and as a por trayal of "the influence of environment on the character and taste of Satin-Legs Smith. . . . [and as] a social-cultural portrait of the values and tastes of some blacks" (Hansell 263). Many readings of "Satin-Legs" (and other of Brooks's poems about</page><page sequence="3">164 College Literature male characters) focus on the portraiture or characterizations, as "depictions of men who are also coping with the diminished content of their lives" (Keizs 143). But "Satin-Legs" is much more than a poem about "a plain black boy's failing attempt to transform his ordinary black self into an exotic type" (Keizs 144). When George Kent points out that "Satin-Legs" constitutes Brooks's critique of the fashionable "hip" style and the attempt to define oneself by clothing and behavior, he touches only briefly on the additional and important textual critique of white aesthetics that the poem constructs: The poem celebrates [Satin-Legs's] powerful assertion of a sense of the beautiful through clothes, a highly styled behavior that permits with drawal to self-gratifying indulgences including the absolute value he places upon sex. But it comes down hard on the shortcomings of Smith and the addressed white observer whose oppression has reduced the reach for beauty and evoked a response of grotesqueness. ("Aesthetic Values" 41) Later, in his biography of Brooks, Kent expands his ideas: The poem protests a society that deprives Satin-Legs of genuine material with which to express his art and his quest for beauty and gusto. The drama of the poem arises from the presence of a speaker and a white observer of conventional notions who is being indicted as a representa tive of the depriving society. (A Life 68) Not only does the poem protest a depriving society, but it dismantles the very aesthetic values that flourish in and under gird that society. Indeed, Brooks points to "Satin-Legs" as one of her early poems that exemplify the more radical or political voice her critics tend to find only in her post-'50s poetry, describing the poem as one in which political awareness "is crowded back into the language" (T?te 42). While it is possible to miss the subversive and resistive voice, the social text of "Satin-Legs," that voice finds its strongest articulation in the address to the white reader/critic. "Satin-Legs" is actually comprised of several voices, all belonging to the same narrator: elegant, detached, descriptive ("These kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk"), teacherly ("Let us proceed"), smug and sarcastic ("Perhaps you would prefer. . . . You forget and you forget"), omniscient ("The pasts of his ancestors lean against / Him. Crowd him"), anguished and prophetic ("People are so in need, in need of help"). The shifting voice and tone of the narrator go far to disrupt the reader's expectation that the smooth, internally rhymed opening lines of the poem ("Inamoratas, with an approbation, / Bestowed his title. Blessed his inclina tion") will be consistent throughout. In the shifts and permutations of narrative voice, the presence of an outside "other" begins to take shape?a character distinct from both the narrator and Satin-Legs.</page><page sequence="4">Ann Folwell Stanford 165 Brooks does not introduce this other textual presence immediately. After the narrator's first nod toward the women in Satin-Legs's life, she describes, in three tercets, his waking and rising from bed: He wakes, unwinds, elaborately: a cat Tawny, reluctant, royal. . . . He waits a moment, he designs his reign, That no performance may be plain or vain. . . . He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days. And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the Postponed resentments and the prim precautions, (lines 3-11) The narrator's description?thick with alliteration, internal rhyme, and crisp end rhyme?becomes metrically irregular by the third quoted stanza, where the private Satin-Legs becomes somewhat public. The outer layer, the thing looked upon, like the manifest text of a poem, is not all it seems. What Satin-Legs puts away ("sheds") are the private (and by his standards, less lovely) aspects of a human life? desertedness, fear, and resentments. He readies himself for the essentially performa tive function his public life demands; "he designs his reign, / That no performance may be plain or vain." Many of the characters in Brooks's early poems have this doubleness to their lives, especially those characters in whom Brooks inscribes a resistance and chal lenge to white readers. The "Gay Chaps" of Brooks's war sonnets by that name appear to be carefree men drinking and celebrating at a bar, but in fact the sequence deconstructs the facades that enable white audiences to maintain destructive and dehumanizing stereotypes. The speaker of "Negro Hero," while lionized by the press, seems appropriately grateful and proud, but carries on a perceptive dialogue with himself about the truth of his "heroism." Detached, distanced descriptions of people or situations ("He wakes, unwinds, elaborately") are, however, more comfortable to read than what becomes direct address in this poem. It comes as something of a surprise when, twelve lines into the poem, the narrator interrupts her flowing description and directs a ques tion to a heretofore unnoticed and unremarked observer: "Now, at his bath, would you deny him lavender / Or take away the power of his pine?" (emphasis mine). The narrator pivots from Satin-Legs to focus upon an unnamed "you." The shift, although not an unusual poetic technique, is unsettling because of its abruptness. Upsetting the expectation of being able to read unnoticed and unobserved, it is as though the narrator has caught a voyeur red-handed?and not only caught, but drawn him or her into the making of the poem, for the narrator demands to know what "you" would prescribe for Satin-Legs's bath:</page><page sequence="5">166 College Literature What smelly substitute, heady as wine, Would you provide? life must be aromatic. There must be scent, somehow there must be some. Would you have flowers in his life? suggest Asters? a Really Good geranium? (14-18) The point here is not so much what the third "other" would actually wish for Satin-Legs, but that there is an "other" written into the poem. And it is this character's spatial position that is important, for the character, while gazing on Satin-Legs, is him- or herself the object of the narrator's gaze, and manipulated at the narrator's will. The act of "being watched" is thus transferred from Satin-Legs to the reader/critic, rendering the latter as vulnerable as Satin-Legs himself to the narrator's poetic making and remaking. The reader/critic accrues certain qualities by indirection. These qualities make it clear that he or she is not simply a generic or "neutral" reader or watcher, but probably a white (or perhaps a middle-class black) person who watches from a critical and uncomprehending stance. At any rate, the narrator's questions and remarks suggest that the reader/critic is an outsider to Satin-Legs's tradition and culture?certainly to the particulars of his everyday life: "But you forget, or did you ever know?" the narrator asks condescendingly. In addition, the reader/critic, while apparently somewhat lost, is, according to the narrator, also full of expecta tions and assumptions about what Satin-Legs should have and appreciate, as well as about what constitutes beauty and art. "Perhaps you would prefer to this"; "But could he love them?"; "He would / Not understand your counsels on control." The creation of this third figure anticipates, although more subtly and with different expectations, the white characters in Annie Allen who visit Benvenuti's wishing for a show of exotica ("tropical truths") when the black patrons arrive. While the whites of "I love those little booths at Benvenuti's" expect a "dusky folk, so clamorous! / So colorfully incorrect, / So amorous, / So flatly brave!" and wish for a show of what they expect a black person to be, the reader/critic seems to expect Satin-Legs to have, desire, and/or appreciate those qualities and things that comprise white culture ("the best / Of taste and straight tradition"). The narrator's questions and comments thus construct a presence in the poem modeled on those very real literary critics who suffer from what Adrienne Rich calls "white solipsism" ? the tendency to "think, imagine, and speak as if whiteness described the world" (299) ?that is, most white literary critics of the 1940s. By writing ("righting") an oppositional character into the poem itself, Brooks meets the "enemy" on a turf of her own choice, fusing her anxiety about the reception of these early poems with a carefully crafted resistance to the potential devaluation of her work. The inclusion of a reader/critic and an instructive narrator allows the text to voice its own desire for a more appropriate reading than it was likely in 1945 to generate among white critics. Brooks's early poetry was vulnerable to paternalism, and because she was both black and female, her work was especially vulnerable to racist /sexist assumptions and expectations.2</page><page sequence="6">Ann Folwell Stanford 167 It is no accident, then, that throughout "Satin-Legs," the reader/critic is kept passive, invisible, and silent. Locked within the text, it is his or her turn to be observed and judged, brought to life, as it were, only by the words of the narrator. What animates the dynamic between reader/critic and narrator in "Satin-Legs" is the classical rhetorical device of apostrophe, the function of which is worth pausing over. Barbara Johnson notes that the use of apostrophe "has come to seem almost synonymous with the lyric voice" (29), and points out that Apostrophe . . . manipulates the I/Thou structure of direct address in an indirect, fictionalized way. The absent, dead, or inanimate entity addressed is thereby made present, animate, and anthropomorphic. Apostrophe is a form of ventriloquism through which the speaker throws voice, life, and human form into the addressee, turning its silence into mute responsiveness. (30) Although Johnson does not probe the implications of apostrophizing a physically absent but otherwise ever-present internalized and oppressive other, those implica tions are significant. As noted above, if a writer has a sense of a potentially critical (and alien) readership, what better way to address her anxiety than to write that audience directly into the poem? To create the disapproving other, to embed it in the text, and to bring it to life or silence it with a commanding stroke of the pen, is to render that other less powerful. And as Johnson asserts, "if apostrophe is the giving of voice, the throwing of voice, the giving of animation, then a poet using it is always in a sense saying to the addressee, 'Be thou me' " (31). Indeed, in the dynamic between the narrator and the reader/critic, a uniquely instructive and critical voice emerges, one that seems to shift and slide between authority and correction. The voice speaking to the reader/critic says, if not "Be thou me," at least "Put yourself in a different place; be thou open and listen to what I have to teach you about my poem." The creation of the apostrophized reader/critic, then, becomes an attempt to narrow the gap between the poem and the distant, critical gaze of the many readers outside, or at the boundary of the poem. If the narrator can speak to the reader/ critic, constructing and instructing him or her within the text, that narrator has thus enabled the poem to be both the thing observed and its own commentary. The poem is "about" Satin-Legs, but it is also the site of a struggle between the white (or outside "other") reader/critic and the narrator of the poem. The constellation of narrator, reader/critic, and Satin-Legs also bears exami nation. The narrator watches Satin-Legs (who is unaware and silent throughout), thus reversing conventions of lyric love poetry where the male lover gazes on the adored (and silent) female beloved. In "Satin-Legs" the male paramour falls under the critical scrutiny of the narrator?and behind her, the curious gaze of the reader/ critic. Hortense Spillers suggests it is the sense of being looked at that gives rise to the concept of the "feminine" in Maude Martha (225). If this is so, it seems that</page><page sequence="7">168 College Literature Satin-Legs is in the interesting position of being textually cross-dressed, fixed under the gaze of both narrator and critic. However, the narrator shifts her gaze from Satin-Legs to the reader/critic, who happens to be watching Satin-Legs as well. By positioning a reader /critic within the text, Brooks forces certain outside "readers," those who would judge the poem by white aesthetic standards alone, to look not only at the subject of the poem (Satin-Legs himself), but at the reader/critic reading the poem. Because that reader/critic is an object of the poem's scrutiny, the outside reader by extension must "read" him- or herself into the poem as well ?and the reader/critic functions somewhat as a textually constructed mirror for the outside "other." Thus, posi tioned medially between the reader/critic and Satin-Legs (standing in the same central position within the poem as the poem itself holds within the book), the narrator frequently shifts attention from Satin-Legs to the reader/critic. Reading the poem, then, becomes a lesson in much more than the content of a day in the life of Satin-Legs Smith. Rather it is an examination of the dynamic that inheres between the reader/critic and the narrator. In "Satin-Legs," privileged access to knowledge remains in the domain of the narrator, doled out only piece meal, and only after the reader/critic has been notified of his or her errors in perception. The poem functions as a corrective and as a primer in reading poetry that has roots in a tradition and culture that is "other." Moreover, it upsets the balance of power, placing Satin-Legs's tradition and life in the center, forcing the reader/critic to confront the uncomfortable possibility that his or her world is the foreign one, is "other." 3. ART, BEAUTY, AND VALUE Two issues central to the poem are aesthetic valuation and cultural chauvin ism, with which the poem deals by a repositioning of power, a shift of the locus of control from the reader/critic to the narrator, as I have noted above. When the narrator turns to the reader /critic, then, and requests a prescription for Satin-Legs, she assumes that the reader/critic has been judging and prescribing throughout the three opening stanzas of narrative description?OK then, what would you provide for Satin-Legs? The question implies an expected disapproval of his lavender and pine, and the narrator provides alternative choices for the reader/critic: Would you have flowers in his life? suggest Asters? a Really Good geranium? A white carnation? would you prescribe a Show With the cold lilies, formal chrysanthemum Magnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic Red of prize roses? might his happiest Alternative (you muse) be, after all, A bit of gentle garden in the best Of taste and straight tradition? Maybe so. (17-25)</page><page sequence="8">Ann Folwell Stanford 169 More than one critic has noted that Satin-Legs bears affinities to Eliot's Prufrock (Melhem 32-34, G. Smith 35-36). Here, however, it is not Satin-Legs who has to decide whether to part his hair in the middle or eat a peach ?or use lavender and pine?but the reader /critic. The narrator gives the reader/critic the problem of deciding among all the lush choices a "straight tradition" provides. By reversing the position of the Prufrockian antihero, Brooks again places the reader/ critic in the vulnerable position, deflecting the readerly "gaze" from Satin-Legs and back onto the reader/critic him- or herself. In addition, by proposing ?insisting? that the reader/critic join in the making of the poem, and then constructing her narrative so that the reader/critic can only come away having failed, the narrator not only entraps the reader/critic, but makes an important point as well. For in that interaction, the narrator dramatizes for the reader/critic the futility and, really, the silliness of trying to overlay traditional aesthetic assumptions on this poem that, as Brooks said of Langston Hughes, "mightily uses the street" (Report 71), rather than the roses and "straight tradition" of high culture. Other repositionings of power occur as the narrator makes clear the disjunc tion between what she knows and what the reader/critic ("you") sees. Restricting access to Satin-Legs's world, the narrator leaves the reader/critic no choice but to follow her lead, to accept her rendering of Satin-Legs's life. What you think you know, the poem sarcastically implies, you probably do not: But you forget, or did you ever know, His heritage of cabbage and pigtails, Old intimacy with alleys, garbage pails, Down in the deep (but always beautiful) South Where roses blush their blithest (it is said) And sweet magnolias put Chanel to shame. (26-31) Taking on a highly corrective tone, the narrator points out that those things the reader/critic either forgets or doesn't know are, of course, the details of Satin Legs's past?both individual and cultural ?a past that becomes more important in understanding the concept of art as the poem progresses. As is true for many of Brooks's characters, Satin-Legs's is a past that has been either invisible or mytholo gized out of all proportion in white society and culture. While the surface view of Satin-Legs communicates one thing, what the narrator knows provides another dimension to his character. The narrator's additions to what the reader/critic either expects, desires, or sees as appropriate for Satin-Legs shift the locus of control from the reader/critic's understanding (which is at best superficial and limited) to the narrator's privileged epistemological stance. Because the discourse on flowers for Satin-Legs begins with reference to pine and lavender for the bath (and with the implicit disapproval of the reader/critic), the text indirectly circles back to the original question, "What . . . / Would you provide?" But here the narrator takes the matter out of the reader/critic's hands and becomes prescriptive: "You might as well / Leave him his lotion, lavender and</page><page sequence="9">170 College Literature oil," employing a more directive tone and becoming both challenger and ironist. After informing the reader/critic, with some satisfaction, that Satin-Legs does not own a flower ("No! He has not a flower to his name"), she continues, again sarcastically, "Ah, there is little hope. You might as well?." But the sentence is left temporarily unfinished, almost as a tease to entice the reader/critic to stay with the narrator as she issues a playful-sounding but deadly serious challenge: No! He has not a flower to his name. Except a feather one, for his lapel. Apart from that, if he should think of flowers It is in terms of dandelions or death. Ah, there is little hope. You might as well? Unless you care to set the world a-boil And do a lot of equalizing things, Remove a little ermine, say, from kings, Shake hands with paupers and appoint them men, For instance?certainly you might as well Leave him his lotion, lavender and oil. (32-42) These lines constitute a direct challenge to common assumptions about beauty and access to it. For, the narrator says, unless "you" wish to alter the political and cultural hegemony, shifting the balance of power to empower the dispossessed, things will never change, and men like Satin-Legs ? for whom the reader/critic has by now been lured into wishing flowers rather than lavender and pine?simply will not have access to such niceties (even if they did want them). Indeed, Satin-Legs thinks of flowers only "in terms of dandelions or death," suggesting the grim conditions under which flowers are available to those like him. This section of the poem constructs a problematic algebra. If (a), that Satin Legs has no flowers, plus (b), that the reader/critic expects (wants) him to, equals (c), that for Satin-Legs to have flowers the entire political and social structure would have to be altered, does this mean that "flowers" are the thing to be desired? Do "flowers" function metaphorically for Western aesthetic standards or even for white materialistic standards? If so, can the poem be suggesting that these stan dards would (should) be preferred to Satin-Legs's own? I think not. Rather the text dismantles, and in so doing, resists the notion of inherent value. "The best / Of taste and straight tradition" simply will not work in Satin-Legs's case. But neither does the narrator prefer the alternative?no flowers, no scent. Instead she coolly suggests that the reader /critic "might as well / Leave him his lotion, laven der and oil." The dynamic operating among reader /critic, narrator, and Satin-Legs reveals the extraordinary difficulty of approaching and evaluating a work whose content and form may be unfamiliar to the "best / Of taste and straight tradition." Barbara Herrnstein Smith's explorations into evaluation and literary worth have led her to a rethinking of the entire concept of value and are helpful in</page><page sequence="10">Ann Folwell Stanford 171 considering "Satin-Legs": "All value is radically contingent, being neither an inher ent property of objects nor an arbitrary projection of subjects but, rather, the product of the dynamics of an economic system" (11). Smith points out the difference between what are commonly called "matters of taste" and what seem to have "inherent value." Tastes that diverge from the majority of community prefer ences, that "vary individually along a wide spectrum," are (predictably) those that fall into the former category?subjective matters of taste. Conversely, those tastes and preferences that are "tractable to cultural channelling and . . . remain fairly stable under a variety of conditions" are those that will seem natural, "rational," and inherently valuable (17). In addition, Smith comments on the cultural produc tion of value: By providing them with "necessary backgrounds," teaching them "appropriate skills," "cultivating their interests," and, generally, "devel oping their tastes," the academy produces generation after generation of subjects for whom the objects and texts thus labeled do indeed perform the functions thus privileged, thereby insuring the continuity of mutu ally defining canonical works, canonical functions, and canonical audi ences. (23) In other words, the academy (and by extension other creators of taste) is the arbiter and gatekeeper of value. The implications for those voices that diverge from the cultural mainstream are obvious?they are devalued and dismissed. This is not to suggest that "Satin-Legs" presents an argument for throwing over traditional white values in favor of zoot suits. What the text does not do is to provide pat answers; rather it exposes the politics of valuation, challenging the reader /critic (and, perhaps, readers in general) to rethink the concept, and to bring to those questionings a sharper critique of cultural "givens." In "Satin-Legs," Brooks aims her criticism at the gatekeepers of aesthetic value. Furthermore, the poem implies, the "best of straight tradition" offers no tools for the excavation of any textual terrain other than that which is familiar. But the poem itself contains those tools necessary for its reading. Listen, watch, and be teachable, the narrator seems to be saying to the reader/critic. 4. CONSTRICTION AND INCIPIENT REVOLUTION Social critique and Brooks's coded warning become more pronounced as the poem progresses. Having (presumably) now convinced the reader /critic of his or her inadequate resources for "reading" Satin-Legs, the narrator takes a slightly different approach. In the next stanza "you" becomes "us" ("Let us proceed. Let us inspect, together"). The narrator invites the reader/critic to inspect the "innards" of Satin-Legs's closet with her. As in the previous two longer stanzas, this stanza embeds what the narrator considers to be the reader/critic's expectations (a vault of diamonds and pearls or silver plate) within the description of Satin-Legs's closet</page><page sequence="11">172 College Literature (zoot suits, "wonder-suits in yellow and in wine").3 The poem makes clear the disjunction between the reader/critic's expectations and the actual content of the poem throughout ?cabbages and pigtails vs. flowers; wonder-suits vs. diamonds and silver plate. Bowing to poetic convention and tradition (flowers, silver, and pearls as suitably "poetic" metaphors), the narrator implies that this poem will upset expectation, and indeed that the disjunction between expectations and the poem's actual content must be laid bare again and again for the reader/critic to become properly "trained" to read this and other nontraditional poetry. The narrator's attitude toward Satin-Legs appears at times to be almost as condescending as she expects the reader/critic's to be. The use of words like "vault" to describe his closet, or "sarcastic" to describe the colors of his suits, implies the narrator's values as well. Her critique of the reader/critic in no way implies an unqualified acceptance of Satin-Legs or his lifestyle. Rather than defend ing Satin-Legs from an alien reader, she constructs a trap for the reader/critic within the context of her descriptions. If Brooks had created a character more obviously sympathetic to the narrator, it would not have been as easy for the reader/critic to fall into the critical and judgmental stance into which he or she does fall. It is precisely this judgmental stance that provides the narrator with her opportunity for critique and correction. Along with zoot suits, the closet also contains "hats / Like bright umbrellas; and hysterical ties / Like narrow banners for some gathering war." Although Satin-Legs is unaware of his surroundings and the implications of his choices, the narrator is not. The images are rife with warning. In fact, the years during and immediately following World War II (the years when zoot suits flourished) saw a slow buildup of pressure and conflict among American blacks at home. John Hope Franklin and Alfred A. Moss, Jr., note that "the migration of large numbers of Negroes to the North and the West in search of employment raised anew the difficult question of how blacks and whites could live together peacefully in communities where the patterns of race relations were, at best, confused" (403). Serious race riots broke out during the war, the most destructive being in Detroit in 1943 where 25 blacks and nine whites were killed and several hundred thousand dollars' worth of property was destroyed (Franklin and Moss 403). While the government and the War Department took steps to raise the morale of blacks both at home and abroad, they accomplished little (segregation continued to be the rule), and morale remained low. When the narrator alerts the reader/critic to the conditions of Satin-Legs's life (and, by extension, the lives of other blacks in America), she warns that those conditions will inevitably lead to a reaction, a "gathering war." Those forces gathering "wildness" in Satin-Legs's closet may eventually break open, much like Langston Hughes's dream, which if deferred is more likely to "explode" than to dry up "like a raisin in the sun." The text warns on two levels, then. First, racism and its choking conditions in America are creating a gathering war. Second, and much more subtly, the text suggests that the standards that would judge a poem on the basis of white aesthetics alone will "choke" not only the textual richness of the</page><page sequence="12">Ann Folwell Stanford 173 poem itself but the reader's appreciation of the artistry of the poem as well. Brooks takes great pains to provide an apologia of sorts for her own poetry: read this, the narrator insists, but read it carefully and do not choke the life out of it with readings that look only for silver, pearl, and lush hothouse flowers. After the carefully coded warning of impending war and aesthetic lifelessness, the narrator's tone shifts abruptly in the next couplet as she turns to the reader/ critic and declaims: People are so in need, in need of help. People want so much that they do not know. (56-57) This abrupt intrusion into the almost offhand narration of the "innards" of Satin Legs's closet swings the focus from Satin-Legs to "people," who, like Satin-Legs, exist Below the tinkling trade of little coins The gold impulse not possible to show Or spend. Promise piled over and betrayed. (58-60) Warning ("hysterical ties") flows into the observation of buried promise. The structure of reference (war?people in need?buried promise) underscores the polit ical consequences of consistently deferred dreams: no less than violent eruption. Although it is a consequence to which Satin-Legs himself is oblivious, the point is not so much Satin-Legs's need to understand, but the reader/critic's. For it is not just Satin-Legs, but many "people" who are in need, who are oblivious to their own lack. At one level, these are the many people about whom Brooks writes in Bronzeville and Annie Allen. The "promise [that is] piled over and betrayed" is one of the primary passions of her poetry. From the image of Bronzeville* s Madame buried in her grave along with her fortune ("southeast corner" [23]); to "obituary for a living lady" (34), where sexual passion is cut off and diverted into religious fervor; to the aborted children of "the mother" (21); and to Annie Allen's tamed down rage, Brooks's early poetry probes the complexities of stalled or deferred promise. One of the functions of these poems is to dismantle the ideology that veils the dreams of a people (both collectively and individually) to an uncomprehending or blind white world. Brooks's poems seek to illuminate those aspects of black lives that are most often erased by white culture and society. Indeed most of the poems in the first half of Bronzeville are about the betrayal of promise. "The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith," by positing and creating a reader/critic, provides a lens through which to view these characters and contexts of the earlier poems in Bronzeville. However, at another level, what is significant about those "people ... so in need" who "want so much that they do not know" is that they not only are the many Satin-Legs Smiths of Bronzeville, but also the many reader/critics outside. For it is these reader/critics who lack the necessary tools to read Brooks's poems.</page><page sequence="13">174 College Literature Further, the text suggests that desire ("people want so much") can preclude knowing. Another way of saying it might be that desire (for a reading true to "my" experience, "my" expectations) actually blinds me and prevents an apprehen sion of the truths the text may contain. One sees what one wants to see, the poem warns, and that seeing, when it is skewed or blinded by expectations, has serious political consequences ?the censure and erasure of the alien "other," and the poten tial for violence that results from such oppression. Because the narrator could be talking to the reader/critic about Satin-Legs or could be talking to herself about the reader/critic, the exact addressee of the "people" passage is deliberately ambiguous. The narrator's tone here is one of sorrow, almost of biblical prophecy?the anguished outcry of one who herself sees and knows all too much. Here the narrator plays the role of mediator, the oracle who sees and speaks to two separate worlds (the implied reader/critic's and Satin Legs's) at once, holding them in tension, bringing them into dialogue. But throughout the text, the narrator maintains firm control of speech; neither the reader/critic nor Satin-Legs ever utters a word. Authority remains entirely in the domain (and mouth) of the narrator. 5. BLUES, POVERTY, AND THE PRODUCTION OF ART The poem culminates with its most intense focus on aesthetics and value. As suddenly as the narrator's oracular lines began, they end, and she turns back to Satin-Legs himself, pointing out that for him, his clothes and manner of dressing are "all his sculpture and his art." These kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk. Then they receive the brave and beautiful Embrace of some of that equivocal wool. He looks into his mirror, loves himself? (61-64) For Satin-Legs, art goes no further than the sensual. His body is both the arbiter of value, as he receives "the kiss of silk," and the source of it, since it is the image of himself that Satin-Legs sees and loves. In this look at why man might love art, the description of Satin-Legs mimes potential reader/critics everywhere. The lines critique the solipsism inherent in what feminist critics have termed phallocentric (and probably more accurate here, ethnocentric) evaluative gestures: does the thing evaluated please me? does the thing reflect my image? is my body "kissed" by the thing? While the reader/critic might be relieved to have the finger point toward Satin-Legs, he or she is implicated in the very description the narrator offers. Additionally, the line between reader/critic ("self) and Satin-Legs ("other") nar rows in this descriptive moment, linking the reader/critic's function to Satin-Legs's morning ritual of bathing and dressing. Lest the reader/critic begin to sense a lessening pressure, however, the narrator returns to the second-person form of address and suggests in a sarcastic</page><page sequence="14">Ann Folwell Stanford 175 tone, much as she did earlier in the poem, that the reader/critic might have a better idea: Perhaps you would prefer to this a fine Value of marble, complicated stone. Would have him think with horror of baroque, Rococo. You forget and you forget. (70-73) The narrator now identifies the reader/critic as art (literary) critic, having under taken the act of criticism in the review of Satin-Legs's morning rites, closet, and manner of dressing. To be sure, the narrator does not look favorably upon such critics and pointedly reminds this reader/critic of his or her limited access to the necessary means or materials by which to judge Satin-Legs ("you forget and you forget"). Similarly, "Satin-Legs" instructs would-be readers that any of the characters in Bronzeville?the old marrieds, Mrs. Martin, the hunchback girl, Sadie and Maude, Matthew Cole, Pearl May Lee, chocolate Mabbie?any of those characters, themselves "poems," will not make sense, will not work as well or be seen as clearly, when looked at through the lens of exclusively white (especially New Critical) artistic standards. And yet Brooks constructs this corrective in a form familiar to and celebrated by white New Critics and modernist poets. The diction is carefully crafted and unusual, the rhyme and alliteration are complex, the language economic, and the layers of meaning multiple. Thus even as the form of the poem may be familiar to white readers, the text undoes that familiarity, insisting that such readers must widen the perimeters of their own expectations about poetry and its content, about art and beauty. The poem insists also on erasing the lines that separate the character Satin Legs from the character the reader/critic. After the narrator points out the reader/ critic's lack of insight or memory ("You forget and you forget"), she turns to Satin-Legs and begins to explore his limited powers of perception. Having eaten a quick breakfast, he bounds outside where he "hears and does not hear" and where he "sees and does not see." While Satin-Legs is himself an artifact difficult to interpret, the artifacts around him are equally difficult to interpret, to apprehend. Although focused on himself, Satin-Legs is not entirely blind; he both sees and does not see, hears and does not hear. It is important that the narrative has been constructed, in part, for the reader/critic who, presumably, is still watching and listening. The details of what Satin-Legs encounters outside comprise a rich evocation of urban ghetto life?the sounds of a robin side by side with "consumption's spiritless expectoration," broken windows alongside a little girl's ribbons. Even the lovelier elements in Brooks's catalogue are qualified with markers that signal pain. The Sunday happiness of children is "governed," the robin has to pinch "a track through apathy and din," the girl's ribbons deck "wornness," and the holy wom en's faces bear a look of "asking." Finally, the men are "estranged" from music, but</page><page sequence="15">176 College Literature not from hunger. It is, perhaps, the hungers, the askings, the governed happiness of children that occlude an appreciation for art. These hungers and askings are also the keys to Satin-Legs's seeming insensitivity to his surroundings. But the text also makes a point here about art in general?what it is, who appreciates it, and how that appreciation takes shape. Included in the catalogue of things Satin-Legs "hears and does not hear" is an art that is clearly identified as a black form: the blues, what Houston Baker calls "the 'always already' of Afro American culture. . . . the multiplex, enabling script in which Afro-American cultural discourse is inscribed" (4). By introducing blues into the text, the poem provides a challenge to the hegemony of European forms. Although critics have argued that Satin-Legs is insensitive to his surroundings (an insensitivity that needs to be qualified as to degree?Satin-Legs is not an insensitive dolt), there is more to it than that. The sounds of the street that Satin-Legs hears include "The Lonesome Blues," the "Long-lost Blues," and "I Want A Big Fat Mama." And this music is set in direct opposition to European music with mention of four composers who, R. Baxter Miller has noted, represent Western, Northern, Eastern, and Central Europe (106): Down these sore avenues Comes no Saint-Sa?ns, no piquant elusive Grieg, And not Tschaikovsky's wayward eloquence And not the shapely tender drift of Brahms. (102-05) What sounds do roll down the sore avenues are composed of weeping and/or "restless glee," for indeed, the blues as a traditional form contains both the joy and the sorrow of black experience and constitutes an impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one's aching consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation of philosophy but by squeezing from it a near-tragic, near-comic lyricism. As a form, the blues is an autobiographical chronicle of personal catastrophe expressed lyrically. (Ellison 78-79) Although Satin-Legs does not hear and see the way the reader/critic might expect him to, he does have his own peculiar way of seeing. He both sees and does not see "the broken windows / Hiding their shame with newsprint." Those smeared sounds and blurred sights confronting Satin-Legs are elements that coa lesce in the blues to create a unique and complex work of art. If blues both contains and does not contain weeping, if it does and does not contain restless glee, perhaps the narrator is attempting to train the reader/critic to the complexity of an art that does not mime white class privilege and ideology, especially art created by an American black. Such art contains elements both European (white) and African (black); it is formal as well as idiomatic; it is straightforward and it is coded; it is</page><page sequence="16">Ann Folwell Stanford 177 and it is not what it appears to be. Indeed, the blues, as trope for the sounds and sights of Afro-American art, is extremely difficult to describe: The tonality comes from an indeterminacy in several crucial intervals of the scale, the third, fifth, or seventh degrees, which are the so-called blues notes. But actually something more complicated is involved and this is compounded by the fact that one of the characteristics of Negro folk music is that in performance it sounds very different from what any notation can describe. (Bluestein 608) The difficulty in describing the blues may also be analogous to the difficulty with which Brooks imagined her readers ? especially literary critics ?would interpret and "describe" her own particular art. "Satin-Legs" inscribes its own opposition to skewed critical interpretation. It is as if the poem writes of itself, "Beware. I, like the blues, don't fall into any of your handy categories of description." Such textual gestures of resistance to (white) critical intrusion are part and parcel of many of Brooks's best poems. Not only is the blues difficult to describe, but it becomes a reminder that value, particularly aesthetic value, is contingent. Blues was not always the popular form it had become by the 1940s. Even when it did become popular among whites, it was still not necessarily considered "art," but rather an exotic and unusual musical form ?one that in white mythology grew "naturally" from a people thought to be universally gifted with rhythm. Because the blues fit in with white notions about black people, white audiences embraced it and only later began to take the music seriously as an art form. In contradistinction to the reader/critic's presumed preference for European music, the narrator points out that value is generated not so much by the artifact as by the observer: But could he love them? Since a man must bring To music what his mother spanked him for When he was two: bits of forgotten hate, Devotion: whether or not his mattress hurts: The little dream his father humored: the thing His sister did for money: what he ate For breakfast ? and for dinner twenty years Ago last autumn: all his skipped desserts. (106-13) In lines that anticipate the current controversy over canon and value, the narrator insists that there is not necessarily an objective "universal" good that inheres in art. While Brahms or Grieg might seem "true" and "beautiful" to a particular race and class (according to what the latter bring to art), their music would have no meaning, no frame of reference, for one like Satin-Legs. This is not an indictment of Satin-Legs's taste any more than it is an attack on the taste of white Europeans and Americans. It is, rather, an attempt to open up the question of value. For Satin</page><page sequence="17">178 College Literature Legs, whom the reader/critic could simply dismiss as a Philistine, art has limited boundaries ?it is restricted to his body and his clothes. But do not forget, the narrator instructs, that it is human beings who evaluate and sustain art; art is not a mystical entity divorced from cultural and social realities, and further, human beings are not the autonomous individuals we might think ourselves. The pasts of his ancestors lean against Him. Crowd him. Fog out his identity. Hundreds of hungers mingle with his own, Hundreds of voices advise so dexterously. (114-17) Although Satin-Legs "quite considers his reactions his," he is a product of his culture and his past. Those pasts, hungers, and voices that shape him are not unlike the pasts, hungers, and voices that shape any human being. And of course, for Satin-Legs and most American blacks, the past is a particularly complex affair. The danger is that Satin-Legs ignores that past, those crowding voices, and mistakenly "judges he walks most powerfully alone." Another point of interest in these lines, however, is the subtext of authorial anxiety, an ambivalence about producing art in the midst of the "hundreds of voices" that "fog out . . . identity." The concern about art textualized in "Satin Legs" echoes what Brooks wrote in her foreword to Langston Hughes's New Negro Poets: "At the present time, poets who happen also to be Negroes are twice tried. They have to write poetry and they have to remember that they are Negroes" (13). Although Brooks omitted mention of the third factor, her gender, she knew her art was produced under constraints unlike those affecting white artists. Those pressures found expression in her critique and instruction of the reader/critic in "Satin-Legs." 6. EATING AT JOE'S: THE READER/CRITIC "GOES OUT FULL" To intensify pressure, the narrator narrows the gap between reader/critic and Satin-Legs even more as the poem near s completion. Satin-Legs visits the movies (where he must "boo / The hero's kiss, and boo the heroine / Whose ivory and yellow it is sin / For his eye to eat of") with his "lady," who "alters as to leg and eye" from week to week. Pointing out Satin-Legs's lack of education "in quiet arts of compromise," the narrator hooks the reader/critic (who has not been addressed directly for some seven stanzas) immediately back into the text, asserting that Satin-Legs "would / Not understand your counsels on control, nor / Thank you for your late trouble." What Pierre Macherey says is "the activity of criticism, [that which] seems to involve a modification of its object. . . . [and] evokes at least the possibility of change, and may, occasionally, provoke it" (15), is precisely what the narrator has been anticipating and resisting throughout the poem. All along the narrator has suggested that the reader/critic has been judging and prescribing for Satin-Legs. Here she confronts the issue directly?"your" modifications will fall on</page><page sequence="18">Ann Folwell Stanford 179 deaf and ungrateful ears, she tells the reader/critic. The narrator provides no real alternative to the activity of criticism other than her challenge (by indirection) to the reader/critic to get and remain teachable, to listen and watch the text with care. Further, the narrator attempts to evoke in the reader/critic a kind of meta criticism or self-criticism, one which would take into account what Judith Newton and Deborah Rosenfelt call "the provisionality of . . . vision" (xxix). The process of interrogating and teasing out the reader/critic's prejudices is an attempt to provide instruction in such criticism?one that takes its own origins, its own prejudices and predilections into account before rushing off into a text to mine it for the "truth." The position of the inscribed "you" becomes more ambiguous as the poem nears its close. Until now, the reader/critic has clearly been an outside observer, but in lines describing Satin-Legs's meal, the narrator plays with the reader/critic's judging and critical exteriority. In this stanza, the narrator sarcastically questions the reader/critic as she draws him or her into the eatery, and implies that the reading/criticism of this poem is much the same as eating at Joe's Eats, where food as-text is consumed: Satin-Legs's indiscriminate gulping of his meal and the reader/ critic's consuming of this poem are not much different. At Joe's Eats You get your fish or chicken on meat platters. With coleslaw, macaroni, candied sweets, Coffee and apple pie. You go out full. (The end is?isn't it? ?all that really matters.) (141-45) Brooks's humor weaves subtly throughout the poem, but is most evident in the concluding stanzas. The narrator leaves the reader/critic "full," having consumed the poem, having been left in the position of having been "had," and finally of having had his or her aesthetic bluff called. Rendered powerless if not ridiculous, having "eaten" his or her fill, the reader/critic now listens to the narrator's humorous final two stanzas: a couplet that sounds like a cross between Carl Sandburg and Wallace Stevens ("And even and intrepid come / The tender boots of night to home"), and a final, italicized, romantic rendition of Satin-Legs making love to his "lady": Her body is like new brown bread Under the Woolworth mignonette. Her body is a honey bowl Whose waiting honey is deep and hot. Her body is like summer earth, Receptive, soft, and absolute . . . (148-53) Mocking European romantic lyric poetry, these lines shift the focus from Satin Legs, from the dynamic between narrator and reader/critic, to this rather dreamy</page><page sequence="19">180 College Literature sestet in which the tawdry sex that apparently occurs every Sunday night after a big meal at Joe's Eats is idealized and romanticized in a form and with lines and language straight out of "High" art and aesthetics. Indeed, this particular focus anticipates Brooks's second volume of poetry, Annie Allen, where romantic ideal ism and sexual politics come under intense scrutiny. The ending of "Satin-Legs" thus summarizes one of the narrator's principal functions throughout ? to dismantle and correct white readers' perceptions of "art" in general, and of this poem and the art generated by African Americans in specific. The narrator, as Kent notes, marks the first appearance of poems where "the real cool black observer" would deliver "considerable bite" to whites ("Aesthetic Val ues" 40). By poking fun at "High" art, "Satin-Legs" undergirds the narrator's methods and purposes, which are none other than a reconsideration of art and aesthetic value. Further, the poem attempts to alert potential readers and critics to issues of cultural difference implicit in that reconsideration. And finally, Brooks's own concern about this poem's reception (and that of others of her poems as well) is inscribed in the narrator's cool but persistent resistance to what she rightly knows to be one of the functions of criticism: to alter or modify the text by bringing to it a "normative reading," one that would argue that "the work should be other than it is" (Macherey 17) according to some standard of transcendent "normalcy" or aesthetic value. "The Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith," placed centrally in A Street in Bronzeville, disrupts fixed and racist readings of the preceding twenty poems about the people and community life of Bronzeville, and prepares the way for the more complex (and perhaps more politically charged) poems like "Negro Hero" and "Gay Chaps at the Bar." NOTES hereafter noted in the text as "Satin-Legs." All quotations from A Street in Bronze ville ("Bronzeville") will be cited in the text and taken from Brooks's omnibus collection, Blacks. 2Reviews and notices of Brooks's early poetry provide examples of prevailing critical stances toward women's poetry. It is not so much that the poems were dismissed or overtly criticized, but that condescension and patronizing attitudes undercut the poetry's perceived value. Stanley Kunitz, for example, in an otherwise positive article, notes that "a becoming modesty" exists in her work and that she does not "pretend to speak for a people" (52). Herman Kogan calls Maude Martha a "touching and appealing little book" written by someone who has the "poetess' eye" (6). An anonymous reviewer notes that Annie Allen has a "warm animal vitality" (Kirkus 319). Sounding as if he is describing a child, Rolphe Humphries pinpoints Brooks's poetic weaknesses in Annie Allen as "awkwardness and naivete when the big word or spectacular rhyme carries her away" ("Verse" 306). He also comments on "Miss Brooks' . . . happy ability to vary the meter to suit the matter," saying that "she is capable of more than one tone" ("Bronzeville" 14). Starr Nelson characterizes Bronzeville as a "little book of poems [that] is doubly effective because it seems such delightfully artless art and ... so innocent of deliberation in its social comment" (15).</page><page sequence="20">Ann Folwell Stanford 181 3Brooks's characterization of Satin-Legs bears a resemblance to the description of zoot-suiters from The New Yorker in 1941, quoted by Jervis Anderson: We herewith submit a preview of men's Easter fashions from the world's least inhibited fashion centre, Harlem. Trousers will be deeply pleated, with the waistband just under the armpits, thirty-inch knees, and fifteen-inch cuffs. A popular suit jacket is one that measures thirty six inches down the back seam and has a fly front, shoulders padded out three and a half inches on each side, two breast pockets, and slashed side pockets. This may be worn with a white doeskin waistcoat. Shoes are pointed, the most popular leathers being light-tan calfskin and colored suede. Hats may be worn in the porkpie shape or with crowns six inches high. Colors, as always, are limited only by spectrum. Anderson notes that the description failed to mention only one important element: "a long watch chain, hitched to the waist of the trousers, which looped down to the ankles" (317).
